       "'Dear Oliver, The making of resolutions appeals to a primeval part of the human psyche: our need for rituals and symbolism. The act of acknowledging that your health, your finances, or your relationships could be improved by changing something plants a strong message in your subconscious. You identify your needs, whether it\\'s to shed a few pounds or ditch self-limiting behaviour; you garner your thoughts, prioritise, and set goals: all catalysts for change. The ritual of writing things down is a simple yet powerful way of regaining a sense of control after the unchecked excesses of the season. Forward planning is an affirmation of optimism for the future. Just because you behaved in a certain way last year - smoked too much, drank too much, were grumpy in the mornings - does not mean you have to be the same this year. A successful company does not go forward without a good business development strategy. Resolutions are our personal development strategy, a commitment to ourselves. Today is a date unlike any other - a symbolic marker of new beginnings, a fresh start. It\\'s an opportunity for pause in our lives, when we focus on what we want from the year ahead. It occurs at a time when we\\'re overfed and overspent, so we naturally incline towards shaping up, becoming leaner, fitter, focused, solvent. So what\\'s stopping you? Make this the year you realise your dreams! Yours sincerely, Elaine Griffiths Dear Elaine, Of course we have to monitor our behaviour and make plans to change it, and of course the start of a new year is a good time to create a punctuation mark - even a new chapter heading - for the next stage in our personal story. But that is not all you are saying. You are offering fool\\'s gold in suggesting that we can realise our dreams. While you may become personally wealthier, through the success of your magazine, if enough people buy into your damaging illusions, the reality is far harsher than that. All of us are powerless to protect ourselves from dog-eat-dog globalised corporatism. It is also extremely hard for us as individuals to grasp the huge impact of our childhood experiences on our adult personalities, something it can take decades, rather than a single year, to sort out. On top of that - although I am sceptical that their effect is great on most people\\'s personality or wellbeing - genes do have a big effect on some people. What if you are a woman who, having consumed the advertising images which pay your wages, dreams of being a 5ft 8in model with fabulous legs but is actually 5ft 2in, with a thick and dumpy lower half? Like so much modern psychology and nearly all think-positive, anyone-can-be-president American psychobilge, you are in the business of encouraging us to believe there are quick fixes for problems that take many years to create and at least as many to solve. Yours sceptically, Oliver James Dear Oliver, Points taken. But what else should we do? Give up trying? None of us is immune to the arbitrary daily threats to our happiness and wellbeing - whether it\\'s falling victim to aggressive globalised corporatism, the legacy of a less-than-perfect childhood, or a genetic tendency to a thick and dumpy lower half. Most of us accept that there are things we cannot change, but understand that there are things we can: negative habits, attitudes, ways of thinking. Some of us may need help with this - often an expensive process that, presumably, pays your wages. Our early experiences undoubtedly shape our characters, but the notion that we spend the first part our lives accruing damage which we then have to spend decades of the second unravelling denies the capacity of the individual to take some responsibility for the way things are in the here and now. Sure, there are no quick fixes, but there is a lot to be said for not blaming others (our past, our parents, the media) for the way we are now. Accepting that our parents and others did the best they could with the knowledge they had available at the time, forgiving them their human faults and frailties, and trying to understand their own stories is enormously liberating. Far from being psychobilge, it seems to me common sense to accept that we cannot change the past, but also to recognise that we can influence our future through our thoughts, actions, decisions and choices, and that we have within us the capacity to take responsibility for writing our personal story. Resolutions can be a tool for doing this. Whatever way you look at it, Oliver, if we ourselves don\\'t realise our dreams, no one else is going to do it for us. Yours, Elaine Dear Elaine, I\\'m not advocating blaming others, nor do I mean to suggest that there is nothing that can be done to help ourselves. But as Roy Baumeister\\'s research has recently shown, the trouble with insecure people telling themselves (or being told by parents or counsellors) that they are great and that they can achieve whatever they dream of achieving is that it can actually make them even more insecure. Unjustified self-esteem needs constant propping up, and when the real world intervenes in the form of a rejection it can cause depression or even violence: Baumeister\\'s study showed that hostility and aggression were sometimes triggered when falsely inflated self-esteem was popped by reality. On the one hand, an American-style culture of complaint - blaming the parents, government etcetera - will get us nowhere; but on the other, it will not do for parents and governments to deny their ultimate responsibility for how we turn out. As individuals, each of us must eke out as much volition as we can from our lives, but the huge difficuties must not be minimised. The danger of being relentlessly and exaggeratedly over-optimistic about what can be achieved is that it actually has the opposite effect. Yours, Oliver Dear Oliver, What a dreary, lacklustre life it would be if we didn\\'t dare to dream. How would anything ever get done if we didn\\'t dare to try because of fear of failure? Setting ourselves goals and targets in the workplace is seen as perfectly acceptable, as is coaching, encouraging and inspiring others to succeed. Why should things be any different when it comes to making personal resolutions? Furthermore, you must be aware of the plethora of research findings showing the power our thoughts and emotions - positive and negative - have on our physiology and behaviour, most notably in Candace Pert\\'s seminal Molecules of Emotion. Thought-based techniques such as creative visualisation, neuro-linguistic programming, hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are all gaining scientific credence for their effectiveness in helping to change negative habits. At their most basic, many of these techniques involve the individual thinking about and often writing down their goals, hopes and aspirations - pretty much what most of us do on January 1 each year. Many of them involve shifting the focus on to the positive - reminding yourself of the benefits of losing a few pounds, for example, rather than how many pounds you need to lose - and playing up one\\'s strengths. Should we refrain from positive self-talk for fear of falsely inflating our self-esteem? Of course a balance has to be struck between optimism and realism, but if we don\\'t at least start off with an expectation of success, we\\'ll fall at the first fence. Even if this year\\'s resolution is simply to accept ourselves as we are, warts and all. Now there\\'s a thought... Happy new year, Oliver. Yours, Elaine Dear Elaine, One of the few really interesting findings of cognitive science is that healthy people live in a bubble of positive illusions. At least 121 studies have shown that in general they view themselves in unrealistically positive ways, believing themselves to have far more control over the external events which dominate their lives than is truly the case and being far more optimistic about the future than probability predicts. By contrast, depressed people suffer from what is known as \"depressive realism\". Although some of their beliefs are incorrectly negative (\"I\\'m fat, I\\'m stupid, I\\'m ugly\", when they\\'re not), they actually have a better grasp of the real likelihood of life going pear-shaped than the undepressed. In this sense, treatments for depression (like cognitive therapy or pills) are often partly about encouraging depressives to see through the rose-coloured specs of the undepressed. That is fine. But where I totally part company with you is if you exploit our need to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative by allying therapy and self-help with the goals of modern corporatism. We do need dreams - but too many of our dreams have been hijacked by commerce and the work ethic. We find ourselves constantly wanting to be something we are not and to own possessions that we \"lack\". No amount of positive-thinking sticking plaster will cure the consequent sense of disappointment which afflicts so many of us on discovering that these dreams are not really ours at all. Yet how far are we really disagreeing? For all my curmudgeoning, a sense of seasonal harmony is sweeping over me. Things can only get better, eh? Happy new year and best wishes, Oliver'"
