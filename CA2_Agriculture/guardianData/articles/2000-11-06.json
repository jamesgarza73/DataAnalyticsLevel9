      "byline": "Frank Keating",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the afternoon of Saturday October 13 1945, next to each other in the directors' box at Stamford Bridge, sat the statesmanlike secretary of the Football Association, Stanley Rous, and Comrade Ravenko, the Soviet sports minister's chief emissary, newly flown in from Moscow. They watched Chelsea play West Ham United, and for much of the match the two men (plus two interpreters) were deep in whispered conversation. </p> <p>Only six months had passed since the death of Hitler, five since VE Day, four since the atom bombing of Hiroshima, and three since Clement Attlee's landslide victory over Winston Churchill in the general election. After the match, in the directors' room, Rous and Ravenko shook hands on their deal before chauffeurs drove them separately away through the bombed-out streets of west London. </p> <p>Three weeks later, on Sunday November 4, an aircraft touched down at Croydon airport, a US-built lend-lease Dakota with a scarlet star motif on the tailfin and each wingtip. Rous of the FA and a bemedalled phalanx of uniformed personnel from the Soviet embassy greeted the disembarking passengers in the hut which served as the arrivals' lounge. </p> <p>They comprised 39 men - 20 footballers and 19 trainers, coaches, journalists or general \"minders\" - and one woman, the interpreter Alex Elliseyeva, whom, in no time, Fleet Street was to dub \"Alexandra the Silent\". </p> <p>It was the Moscow Dynamo football team and through that month, 55 Novembers ago, they were to cause a luminous sensation in grey, austere, war-ravaged Britain. </p> <p>Rous at once had to apologise. He said he had personally telephoned more than 100 London hotels and none could (or would) put up the exotic party en bloc. So their first night was spent bleakly at the Coldstream Guards' Wellington barracks in St James's. They threatened to go home. The next night the party was dispersed in twos or threes around any number of dingy west London hotels. Double the complaints. </p> <p>On the third day, a desperate Rous persuaded the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square to lease him whole floor - \"Do Russians need sheets?\" the manager asked him - but accommodation only. All meals (including breakfast) thereafter were taken at the Soviet Embassy in Kensington. </p> <p>First opponents would be Chelsea on Tuesday November 13. At once, for a whopping \u00a314,000, Chelsea signed the demon Everton and England centre-forward Tommy Lawton, which news doubled the frenzy of anticipation in the capital. Five-shilling tickets (25p today) were already being offered by London spivs for more than \u00a35, which was then the average weekly wage. </p> <p>The Russians said the press could only watch them practise by invitation. Having done so, Fleet Street's finest were dismissively unimpressed. Paul Irwin in the Sunday Express found the Dynamo players \"completely ordinary ... all their work is done standing still. Do not expect much from this bunch of factory workers, Tommy [Lawton] will bag a hatful.\" </p> <p>In the People, Tom Morgan concurred: \"Chelsea will easily uphold the football supremacy of its fatherland with a ringing victory. Dynamos? These pale boys are far too slow for the top drawer.\" </p> <p>Harold Palmer in the Evening Standard predicted that \"Chelsea will sweep them off their feet\", although Stanley Walton in the Sunday Dispatch did warn: \"They all have slightly in-turning toes which, in my youthful days in Scotland, was the hallmark of a useful shot.\" </p> <p>By Tuesday at noon, west London was at a standstill. An hour before the start, the Stamford Bridge gates were closed on an over-capacity crowd of 74,496, but with thousands more breaking through smashed-down gates, it was reckoned next day that the actual attendance was more than 100,000. </p> <p>The Dynamo players warmed up for 15 minutes before kick-off - to the mesmerised delight of the throng that spilled over the greyhound track and right up to the touchlines. No English team had ever \"warmed up\". The Russians then took off their heavy serge \"sweatsuits\" (something else a British crowd had never seen) and to a collective gasp the Dynamo \"strip\" was revealed - dark blue shirts decorated with a pink letter \"D\" at the breast, long powder blue shorts hemmed with white, and emerald-green stockings with white turnovers. </p> <p>Immediately before kick-off, each Russian presented a bouquet of flowers to his opponent. The Chelsea players did not know where to look; the vast crowd fell silent at such a uniquely titillating wonder on an English football field. And it remained dumbfounded once the contest began as the Russians' inch-perfect passes, positional switches and fluent speed made monkeys of the back-pedalling English players. The chivalrous Lawton said afterwards: \"It was brilliant teamwork, speed and ball control. To be honest, the Russians should have been four goals ahead after only 20 minutes except for their poor shooting.\" </p> <p>It ended 3-3. The following Saturday, Dynamo annihilated Cardiff City by 10-0 at Ninian Park (40,000) - \"This is an awesome, greased machine, not a football team,\" said the Cardiff manager Cyril Spiers. On Wednesday, Dynamo beat Arsenal (who had hastily recruited Stanley Matthews) by 4-3 in obliterating fog at Highbury (54,600), and a week later drew 2-2 with Rangers at Ibrox (90,000). </p> <p>They returned to London for shopping, a banquet with the Lord Mayor, and a visit to Karl Marx's grave at Highgate - and left, in a scarlet-starred Dakota from Northolt airport, as surreptitiously as they had come, leaving a bereft Aston Villa with 70,000 printed but unused tickets for a farewell match the Birmingham club mistakenly thought it had arranged. </p> <p>On Sunday December 2, in his column in the Graphic, Stanley Matthews wrote of \"the finest team ever to visit these islands - we have certainly learned a thing or two from these Dynamos\". </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "On the afternoon of Saturday October 13 1945, next to each other in the directors' box at Stamford Bridge, sat the statesmanlike secretary of the Football Association, Stanley Rous, and Comrade Ravenko, the Soviet sports minister's chief emissary, newly flown in from Moscow. They watched Chelsea play West Ham United, and for much of the match the two men (plus two interpreters) were deep in whispered conversation. Only six months had passed since the death of Hitler, five since VE Day, four since the atom bombing of Hiroshima, and three since Clement Attlee's landslide victory over Winston Churchill in the general election. After the match, in the directors' room, Rous and Ravenko shook hands on their deal before chauffeurs drove them separately away through the bombed-out streets of west London. Three weeks later, on Sunday November 4, an aircraft touched down at Croydon airport, a US-built lend-lease Dakota with a scarlet star motif on the tailfin and each wingtip. Rous of the FA and a bemedalled phalanx of uniformed personnel from the Soviet embassy greeted the disembarking passengers in the hut which served as the arrivals' lounge. They comprised 39 men - 20 footballers and 19 trainers, coaches, journalists or general \"minders\" - and one woman, the interpreter Alex Elliseyeva, whom, in no time, Fleet Street was to dub \"Alexandra the Silent\". It was the Moscow Dynamo football team and through that month, 55 Novembers ago, they were to cause a luminous sensation in grey, austere, war-ravaged Britain. Rous at once had to apologise. He said he had personally telephoned more than 100 London hotels and none could (or would) put up the exotic party en bloc. So their first night was spent bleakly at the Coldstream Guards' Wellington barracks in St James's. They threatened to go home. The next night the party was dispersed in twos or threes around any number of dingy west London hotels. Double the complaints. On the third day, a desperate Rous persuaded the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square to lease him whole floor - \"Do Russians need sheets?\" the manager asked him - but accommodation only. All meals (including breakfast) thereafter were taken at the Soviet Embassy in Kensington. First opponents would be Chelsea on Tuesday November 13. At once, for a whopping \u00a314,000, Chelsea signed the demon Everton and England centre-forward Tommy Lawton, which news doubled the frenzy of anticipation in the capital. Five-shilling tickets (25p today) were already being offered by London spivs for more than \u00a35, which was then the average weekly wage. The Russians said the press could only watch them practise by invitation. Having done so, Fleet Street's finest were dismissively unimpressed. Paul Irwin in the Sunday Express found the Dynamo players \"completely ordinary ... all their work is done standing still. Do not expect much from this bunch of factory workers, Tommy [Lawton] will bag a hatful.\" In the People, Tom Morgan concurred: \"Chelsea will easily uphold the football supremacy of its fatherland with a ringing victory. Dynamos? These pale boys are far too slow for the top drawer.\" Harold Palmer in the Evening Standard predicted that \"Chelsea will sweep them off their feet\", although Stanley Walton in the Sunday Dispatch did warn: \"They all have slightly in-turning toes which, in my youthful days in Scotland, was the hallmark of a useful shot.\" By Tuesday at noon, west London was at a standstill. An hour before the start, the Stamford Bridge gates were closed on an over-capacity crowd of 74,496, but with thousands more breaking through smashed-down gates, it was reckoned next day that the actual attendance was more than 100,000. The Dynamo players warmed up for 15 minutes before kick-off - to the mesmerised delight of the throng that spilled over the greyhound track and right up to the touchlines. No English team had ever \"warmed up\". The Russians then took off their heavy serge \"sweatsuits\" (something else a British crowd had never seen) and to a collective gasp the Dynamo \"strip\" was revealed - dark blue shirts decorated with a pink letter \"D\" at the breast, long powder blue shorts hemmed with white, and emerald-green stockings with white turnovers. Immediately before kick-off, each Russian presented a bouquet of flowers to his opponent. The Chelsea players did not know where to look; the vast crowd fell silent at such a uniquely titillating wonder on an English football field. And it remained dumbfounded once the contest began as the Russians' inch-perfect passes, positional switches and fluent speed made monkeys of the back-pedalling English players. The chivalrous Lawton said afterwards: \"It was brilliant teamwork, speed and ball control. To be honest, the Russians should have been four goals ahead after only 20 minutes except for their poor shooting.\" It ended 3-3. The following Saturday, Dynamo annihilated Cardiff City by 10-0 at Ninian Park (40,000) - \"This is an awesome, greased machine, not a football team,\" said the Cardiff manager Cyril Spiers. On Wednesday, Dynamo beat Arsenal (who had hastily recruited Stanley Matthews) by 4-3 in obliterating fog at Highbury (54,600), and a week later drew 2-2 with Rangers at Ibrox (90,000). They returned to London for shopping, a banquet with the Lord Mayor, and a visit to Karl Marx's grave at Highgate - and left, in a scarlet-starred Dakota from Northolt airport, as surreptitiously as they had come, leaving a bereft Aston Villa with 70,000 printed but unused tickets for a farewell match the Birmingham club mistakenly thought it had arranged. On Sunday December 2, in his column in the Graphic, Stanley Matthews wrote of \"the finest team ever to visit these islands - we have certainly learned a thing or two from these Dynamos\". \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>\"Good evening!\" </p> <p>Thick with irony as well as accent, an Italian voice emerged from the throng to greet the Lazio coach as he entered the post-match press conference in the Olympic stadium on Saturday night. </p> <p>\"Buona sera,\" Sven-Goran Eriksson replied, trumping the joke with a nod, a wry smile and immaculate courtesy. Then he settled down to talk about a victory which reassured his club and its fans that, although the heart of their \"mister\" may be pledged to England and its national side, his current attention is focused on consolidating his achievements with Italy's champion club. </p> <p>By a further irony, not for much longer will Eriksson hear himself referred to as \"mister\", which is how players and journalists in Latin countries have addressed their coaches since the days when the British spread the game around the world, organising teams and providing the first generation of managers. But the way Lazio cruised to a 2-0 home victory over Bologna silenced, at least temporarily, local speculation that he would be on his way out of Rome long before his contract ends on the last day of June. </p> <p>Goals from Pavel Nedved and Hernan Crespo, one in each half, were the statistical expression of a total superiority which prompted Eriksson to remark that he had \"rediscovered the Lazio of last season\". After an uncertain start to the campaign, this was their third win in a row. \"It was a fine victory,\" he said. \"I was very pleased. We showed enormous spirit. Physically, mentally and tactically, the team was solid. We gave Bologna very few chances.\" </p> <p>In fact they gave Bologna no chances at all. The visitors failed to muster a single shot. A last-minute fitness test had deprived them of the presence of the little veteran Beppe Signori, whose scoring feats during a long spell with Lazio brought him the unofficial title of the King of Rome before Eriksson arrived three years ago, quickly decided that his reign was over, and sold him. Eriksson seems to have upset remarkably few people during his 25 years in football management, but Signori is definitely among them. </p> <p>When the fans on the Curva Nord caught a glimpse of their once-beloved striker on the big screen before the match, they gave him a warm round of applause. They extended the same courtesy to Eriksson, whose decision last week has clearly not damaged their respect for the man who brought them the championship. Just so long, that is, as he keeps on winning. </p> <p>\"As always, when the results are good, everything is tranquillo,\" he said on Saturday night. \"At the first defeat, the critics will start again. But the team is growing, and we can grow still more in the coming weeks. I believe that this cycle of success for Lazio isn't at an end. It will continue next year and the year after that. This club has learnt how to win, and that will carry on even when I'm no longer on the bench.\" </p> <p>His diplomacy extends to a refusal to discuss England while he is about Lazio's business. \"Until I finish working with Lazio, I'll speak only of Lazio,\" he said. But in the medium term that is simply unrealistic, although there is no indication yet of how great a role Lazio's president, Sergio Cragnotti, will allow him to play in England's two World Cup qualifying matches in the spring. At this early stage, there seems to be no bad feeling. \"Eriksson's head may be in England,\" a writer for the Gazzetta dello Sport noted in his reflections on Saturday's victory, \"but he read the tactics of this match much better than his opposite number.\" As for Cragnotti, he contented himself by saying that \"the players are professionals, and I was certain that they wouldn't let Eriksson's decision affect their performance\". </p> <p>The better things go in Rome, however, the more unrest there is likely to be in England. And it was an Italian, the Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who best summed up the present position of Eriksson's next employers. \"The old is dying and the new cannot be born,\" he wrote. \"In the interim, a variety of morbid symptoms appears.\" Or, to put it another way, nature abhors a vacuum. Hence the wild speculation that Eriksson has already invited Alan Shearer to return to the squad, and that Cragnotti has persuaded him to stay on as Lazio's director of football at the same time as fulfilling his obligations to England. </p> <p>\"It's just not true,\" he said on Saturday of the latter suggestion. But although the Shearer rumour apparently has its basis in a possible return in some non-playing role, it might have contained a germ of what drama-documentary scriptwriters call emotional truth. For Eriksson is certainly a fan of experience, and is not afraid of drawing the last effort from an ageing player. </p> <p>\"Young players are the future,\" he had said last Thursday morning, during the introductory press conference organised by his next employers. \"The future of football, and the future of the Football Association.\" But when it comes to the actual business of winning something, he tends to put his trust in players who have seen it all before. </p> <p>His Lazio line-up on Saturday, starters and substitutes included, averaged 28 years 3 months. His captain, Alessandro Nesta, may be only 24 but Sinisa Mihajlovic and Diego Simeone, 31 and 30 respectively, remain central figures. Fabrizio Ravanelli and Attilio Lombardo, 31 and 34, are important squad members acquired over the last two seasons. And David Seaman might like to note that his starting and substitute goalkeepers, Angelo Peruzzi and Luca Marchegiani, both former internationals, clock in at 30 and 34 respectively. The youngest player in a Lazio shirt was the 22-year-old Roberto Baronio: not a teenager in sight. </p> <p>\"Experience is important, of course,\" Eriksson told me on Saturday. \"But to get experience you have to play. And I think we have a good mixture here. We have some players who are young and experienced.\" But those who imagine that Peter Taylor's former under-21 proteges will be filling the team sheets against Albania and Finland may be in for a disappointment. </p> <p>This will also be the first time Eriksson has coached a side drawn from a single nationality since leaving Gothenburg in 1982, having won the national championship and the Uefa Cup with a team of Swedes. Since then, at Benfica, Roma, Fiorentina, Sampdoria and Lazio, he has grown used to uniting squads of multiple nationalities. His current club, for example, has a powerful Argentinian contingent. </p> <p>\"Eriksson is very good at adapting himself,\" Jan Maillard, the football correspondent of Svenska Dagbladet, a Stockholm daily, said at the weekend. \"He's basically a straightforward man, but since he left Sweden 18 years ago he's developed a kind of diplomatic charisma. We think these days he even looks like an Italian aristocrat. And when he changed his spectacles a year ago he made himself look more like a professor.\" </p> <p>In his earliest days as a manager, when he was taking Degerfors from the third to the first divisions in consecutive seasons, finishing runners-up in their first year in the top flight, Eriksson was greatly influenced by the work of the English coach Bob Houghton, who guided Malmo to a European Cup final against Nottingham Forest. With Gothenburg he refined Houghton's version of the \"pressing\" game and went on to wider success, using players such as Glenn Hysen, Torbjorn Nilsson and Glenn Stromberg, some of whom subsequently joined him in Portugal and Italy. </p> <p>Personal loyalty has always been a factor in his success. During his first season at Gothenburg, when the results were poor and the fans were critical of the style the new coach had introduced, Eriksson called the players together. If you aren't happy with the way we're trying to play, he announced, it would be best for me to leave. They told him they wanted him to stay, and in his fourth season they won the title. When he finally departed for Portugal, the players remarked that they never heard him raise his voice in the dressing room. His way is to wait until the day after a defeat, and then to take the players one by one, sitting them down and talking to them individually. </p> <p>It is a gift he has not lost. \"I'm sorry that he'll be leaving at the end of the season,\" Nedved said, the star of Saturday's game voicing what appears to be the feeling of the Lazio squad. \"He's a great person, and in his time here he's demonstrated he knows how to run things perfectly. I wish him all the best.\" Nedved also squashed the suggestion that the players, faced with the Champions' League and Coppa Italia as well as the defence of their championship, would find it difficult to work for a coach whose destiny is known to be elsewhere. \"I don't think the situation requires a dramatic response,\" he said. \"And if we carry on playing like this, we'll win the title again.\" </p> <p>Such an outcome would probably not please those who hope to see Eriksson either jumping ship or being pushed out by a disaffected Cragnotti. Cooler heads will recognise that the best endorsement of the FA's choice would be not the hasty arrival of their new employee, shaking the dust of Rome from his boots, but a transition conducted according to the letter of his contracts, old and new. That, after all, would be a sign that here is a man who keeps his word, who honours his commitments, who does things properly. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>For the time being the anti-Bryan Robson faction at Middlesbrough has been muzzled, although how long before it bares its teeth again will remain open to debate. </p> <p>The likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better. Robson's return to Manchester United on Saturday promises to be a degrading experience but the following two weeks promise to be more testing. </p> <p>If Middlesbrough have clambered out of the quicksand after successive home games against Leicester and Bradford, Robson will get another chance to prove that Steve Gibson's assertion that \"Bryan's the diamond in our crown\" was not merely the sound of a chairman living in denial. Should their slump continue, even Gibson might have to concede his diamond is actually a dud. </p> <p>Perhaps it is a measure of Middlesbrough's predicament that so many people felt that their fifth consecutive defeat merited something between sympathetic applause and a condescending pat on the back. </p> <p>Their supporters just seemed happy that Operation Damage Limitation had succeeded and Robson attempted to talk up his over-30s club as having conjured up some kind of superhuman effort. \"The commitment and work rate were excellent,\" he repeated over and over again. Yet, against that, his teeth must have ached from the lack of quality. </p> <p>Devoid of width or penetration, Middlesbrough shuffled through more than an hour of muddle and mishap before managing anything approaching a moment of creativity. So it was a pity for Noel Whelan that his defence-splitting flick only flummoxed his own back line, Thierry Henry's skew-whiff shot encapsulating Arsenal's finishing. </p> <p>Had Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side displayed any sort of ruthlessness their goal difference might not look quite so inferior to Manchester United's this morning.

      "bodyText": "For the time being the anti-Bryan Robson faction at Middlesbrough has been muzzled, although how long before it bares its teeth again will remain open to debate. The likelihood is that things will get worse before they get better. Robson's return to Manchester United on Saturday promises to be a degrading experience but the following two weeks promise to be more testing. If Middlesbrough have clambered out of the quicksand after successive home games against Leicester and Bradford, Robson will get another chance to prove that Steve Gibson's assertion that \"Bryan's the diamond in our crown\" was not merely the sound of a chairman living in denial. Should their slump continue, even Gibson might have to concede his diamond is actually a dud. Perhaps it is a measure of Middlesbrough's predicament that so many people felt that their fifth consecutive defeat merited something between sympathetic applause and a condescending pat on the back. Their supporters just seemed happy that Operation Damage Limitation had succeeded and Robson attempted to talk up his over-30s club as having conjured up some kind of superhuman effort. \"The commitment and work rate were excellent,\" he repeated over and over again. Yet, against that, his teeth must have ached from the lack of quality. Devoid of width or penetration, Middlesbrough shuffled through more than an hour of muddle and mishap before managing anything approaching a moment of creativity. So it was a pity for Noel Whelan that his defence-splitting flick only flummoxed his own back line, Thierry Henry's skew-whiff shot encapsulating Arsenal's finishing. Had Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side displayed any sort of ruthlessness their goal difference might not look quite so inferior to Manchester United's this morning. As it was, they teased and tormented their opponents before ultimately getting what they wanted, rather like a cat toying with its prey. There were times when Arsenal's lackadaisical approach threatened to backfire, particularly with John Lukic in goal displaying a bandy-legged uncertainty. But in truth the outcome was a foregone conclusion from the midpoint of the first half, when Gary Pallister overhit a pass for Steve Vickers and Fredrik Ljungberg was left clear on goal. There was no disputing that Mark Crossley poleaxed Ljungberg and, even though Pallister had lolloped into the six-yard area as Middlesbrough's last man, the referee Andy D'Urso was theoretically correct to send the goalkeeper off for denying \"a clear scoring opportunity\". Henry tucked the penalty beyond the substitute goalkeeper Marlon Beresford and, as a contest, that was pretty much it. Many of D'Urso's colleagues would probably have opted for a yellow card rather than red and, looking at the bigger picture, why should a goalkeeper who has given away a penalty while making a legitimate attempt to win the ball be punished more than that anyway? \"Once you send a goalkeeper off, it completely ruins the game. We need some common sense,\" said Crossley. There is also an argument that the sending-off may have saved Robson from another voluble level of dissent. Having spent \u00a378m on players, Robson has not seen his team record a clean sheet all season or a win at home since March. So where does Robson go now?

      "bodyText": "Last Christmas, online shopping was a disaster. The sector was plagued by broken promises, websites that crashed and presents - even turkeys - that weren't delivered in time for Christmas Day. But after pumping millions of pounds all year into foolproof transactional websites, e-retailers are keeping fingers crossed that they'll make it through the coming holiday shopping season and reap grand rewards. A flurry of e-Christmas activity will kick off in the next few weeks. Already, gardening website e-garden.co.uk has thrown its hand into the ring by taking orders for Christmas trees and decorations online. Portals are starting to talk about their Christmas schedules. Freeserve plans to run The Twelve Days of Christmas promotion, kicking off on December 1, with 12 retail partners over 12 days, giving away Christmas prizes every day. Boys toys website Firebox - one of the retailers involved in the Freeserve promotion - expects sales to rise by five times normal levels over the Christmas period. It is running other promotions with Maxim and LineOne and Blue Carrots, and giving away a free Zap Cap (a bottle opener) for orders over \u00a350. This year, more than any before, much is being wagered on a good e-Christmas. For some retailers a bumper Christmas could mean the difference between survival or liquidation, with those that fail to make a profit during the season the unfortunate ones facing closure in the new year. Despite the unavoidable shake-out of dot.com retailers in the new year, the odds are in favour of consumers flocking to the internet to do their Christmas shopping. Jo Tucker, managing director at the Interactive Media in Retail Group thinks this year will be a successful e-Christmas and expects online shopping revenues to soar to \u00a3500m, half that the IMRG says has been made in all the first ten months of this year. \"We're all time-poor at the moment and the thought of going to a busy high street to do Christmas shopping is a nightmare,\" says Ms Tucker. Part of the reason why it will work this year, adds Ms Tucker, is that all the important factors are now in place, such as fulfilment and choice. The fact that all the big high-street retailers, including Debenhams, Argos, Marks &amp; Spencer, Kingfisher, Next, WHSmith, Arcadia and Boots, are now heavily involved in e-commerce should go some way to eroding consumer security fears about shopping online. But unless retailers start breaking clever marketing campaigns in the next few weeks, they may not have the time to prove their mettle in the e-Christmas rush. E-commerce may no longer be in its infancy, but few retailers have had much success with selling over the web. The first e-Christmas in 1998 is now just a bad memory for those involved, especially Microsoft, that sunk millions into the project to get people buying Christmas presents online. And last year not only were retailers far too concerned by the y2k bug to invest too much in e-commerce systems but, by and large, they rushed to market too quickly and were simply unable to cope with demand. According to Continental Research, UK consumers, in the last year, spent a grand total of \u00a3175m on buying Christmas presents online - an average of \u00a397 each - with 69% saying they were satisfied with the process. Retailers that failed consumers back then, have now spent millions trying to win them back this year. That's why this year - the next 56 days - will be a crucial period for everyone in the online retail game.",

      "trailText": "<p>Has the government really thought through its policy on private health care? By their own logic, ministers should abolish prescription and other charges, argues Justin Keen.</p>",
      "byline": "Justin Keen",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last week the government proudly announced a new \"concordat\" between the National Health Service and the private sector - interpreted by cynics as a way of ensuring there will be spare beds about this winter. The phrase \"private health\" conjures up pay beds and Bupa but in fact the non-NHS sector - what people pay for out of their own pockets - is a lot bigger than that. In 1997 non-NHS healthcare spending was just over \u00a38bn. Paid for by taxes, the NHS spent \u00a340bn in 1997-98 so \"private health\" comes to around 17% of total UK health spending. </p> <p>Some \u00a32.1bn was spent on insurance, by private individuals and by companies on behalf of their employees. Just under \u00a32.5bn was spent on pharmaceuticals. This figure rises to around \u00a34bn if we add other over-the-counter healthcare products. </p> <p>Payments made by private individuals for health fall into three broad categories. The first is cash outlays on drugs and patent medicines, dentistry (more than \u00a3300m a year) and glasses, contact lenses, eye tests and other optical services (more than \u00a3500m). Payment for complementary therapies such as osteopathy and acupuncture is at least \u00a3450m a year according to research by Kate Thomas of Sheffield University. Private individuals pay \u00a3500m each year directly out of their pocket on hospital treatment. Self-payment has been growing in recent years, and some 20% of operations and treatments are now paid for directly rather than through insurance. </p> <p>Perhaps long-term care for the elderly or disabled should be added in. Spending on personal healthcare by people living in their own homes or in nursing or residential homes is hard to assess but it is likely to run into the hundreds of millions. Private expenditure on chiropody alone is some \u00a370m a year. </p> <p>A second category of payments are those made to third parties, the largest of which buys private medical insurance for individuals and families. This is worth about \u00a31.1bn a year. Some 2.8m people are covered, which is 3.8% of the population. Some 6m people have health cash plans, which are a cross between low-cost insurance and savings products, designed mainly to help pay for lower cost items such as dental charges, and modest lump sums for hospital stays (whether in private or NHS hospitals). Total contributions to these plans are relatively modest, at around \u00a3200m a year. There are two additional types of private payment in this category: the first is gifts to charities which end up helping the NHS - they total over \u00a3150m a year, according to a recent National Audit Office report; people buy lottery tickets and the National Lottery contributes some \u00a350m a year to the NHS; the third is money paid over directly to the NHS. The great slogan coined for Labour's invention in the 40s was that the health service was free \"at the point of delivery\". It was never entirely accurate even then and since 1951 patients have had to pay explicit user charges. Today the bulk of charges are for prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmic services, and totalled \u00a3800m in 1997-98. </p> <p>\"Private health\" turns out to be a lot more complicated than pronouncements such as Mr Milburn's would imply. He was really only talking about private hospitals and they account for only about a quarter of personal private expenditure on healthcare. Most private health spending is in retail markets, for a wide range of goods and services. The chart shows how the spending divides up. </p> <p>Perhaps the government would rather not think about it. In its National Plan for the NHS in July, the government argued that private medical insurance is a major cause of inequitable access to health care. This is right but the government omitted to mention that user charges for core health services are if anything more inequitable. By their own logic they should have abolished prescription and other charges. Labour has reintroduced free eye tests for people aged 60 years and over but has also actually increased prescription charges. For a government that has restored equity to the political lexicon, and pledged so much new money to the NHS, this is an opportunity missed. </p> <p>To a large extent primary healthcare is private. That is uncontroversial in the sense that people buy pain relief, athlete's foot powder and so on from chemist shops: it is difficult to imagine nationalising over-the-counter pharmacy services.

      "bodyText": "Last week the government proudly announced a new \"concordat\" between the National Health Service and the private sector - interpreted by cynics as a way of ensuring there will be spare beds about this winter. The phrase \"private health\" conjures up pay beds and Bupa but in fact the non-NHS sector - what people pay for out of their own pockets - is a lot bigger than that. In 1997 non-NHS healthcare spending was just over \u00a38bn. Paid for by taxes, the NHS spent \u00a340bn in 1997-98 so \"private health\" comes to around 17% of total UK health spending. Some \u00a32.1bn was spent on insurance, by private individuals and by companies on behalf of their employees. Just under \u00a32.5bn was spent on pharmaceuticals. This figure rises to around \u00a34bn if we add other over-the-counter healthcare products. Payments made by private individuals for health fall into three broad categories. The first is cash outlays on drugs and patent medicines, dentistry (more than \u00a3300m a year) and glasses, contact lenses, eye tests and other optical services (more than \u00a3500m). Payment for complementary therapies such as osteopathy and acupuncture is at least \u00a3450m a year according to research by Kate Thomas of Sheffield University. Private individuals pay \u00a3500m each year directly out of their pocket on hospital treatment. Self-payment has been growing in recent years, and some 20% of operations and treatments are now paid for directly rather than through insurance. Perhaps long-term care for the elderly or disabled should be added in. Spending on personal healthcare by people living in their own homes or in nursing or residential homes is hard to assess but it is likely to run into the hundreds of millions. Private expenditure on chiropody alone is some \u00a370m a year. A second category of payments are those made to third parties, the largest of which buys private medical insurance for individuals and families. This is worth about \u00a31.1bn a year. Some 2.8m people are covered, which is 3.8% of the population. Some 6m people have health cash plans, which are a cross between low-cost insurance and savings products, designed mainly to help pay for lower cost items such as dental charges, and modest lump sums for hospital stays (whether in private or NHS hospitals). Total contributions to these plans are relatively modest, at around \u00a3200m a year. There are two additional types of private payment in this category: the first is gifts to charities which end up helping the NHS - they total over \u00a3150m a year, according to a recent National Audit Office report; people buy lottery tickets and the National Lottery contributes some \u00a350m a year to the NHS; the third is money paid over directly to the NHS. The great slogan coined for Labour's invention in the 40s was that the health service was free \"at the point of delivery\". It was never entirely accurate even then and since 1951 patients have had to pay explicit user charges. Today the bulk of charges are for prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmic services, and totalled \u00a3800m in 1997-98. \"Private health\" turns out to be a lot more complicated than pronouncements such as Mr Milburn's would imply. He was really only talking about private hospitals and they account for only about a quarter of personal private expenditure on healthcare. Most private health spending is in retail markets, for a wide range of goods and services. The chart shows how the spending divides up. Perhaps the government would rather not think about it. In its National Plan for the NHS in July, the government argued that private medical insurance is a major cause of inequitable access to health care. This is right but the government omitted to mention that user charges for core health services are if anything more inequitable. By their own logic they should have abolished prescription and other charges. Labour has reintroduced free eye tests for people aged 60 years and over but has also actually increased prescription charges. For a government that has restored equity to the political lexicon, and pledged so much new money to the NHS, this is an opportunity missed. To a large extent primary healthcare is private. That is uncontroversial in the sense that people buy pain relief, athlete's foot powder and so on from chemist shops: it is difficult to imagine nationalising over-the-counter pharmacy services. But dental and optical services have been turned into mixed economies. The Tories started the ball rolling by increasing charges and Labour has only tinkered with its inheritance rather than reversed policy - it presumably is relaxed about the role of the private sector in health care. Add to all that the private finance initiative (PFI) for building and in some cases maintaining hospitals and now Mr Milburn's concordat, and it is hard to avoid concluding that major changes in the structure and financing of healthcare have already taken place. More are in the pipeline. It is a pity, then, that the concordat focuses mainly on hospital and the new way-station services located between a hospital stay and return home. If a concordat is needed anywhere at the moment it is in general dentistry, where the government now needs the private sector to help solve problems of access. A better appreciation of the nature of private healthcare expenditure and consumption is the starting point for better policies to engage with it.

To be sure, real wages have been rising for the last couple of years, but this follows a period of falling wages stretching back two decades.

In part this has been due to the remarkable vigour and innovative zeal of Americans themselves, but it has also been due to the pump priming provided by massive defence spending in the 80s, the weakness of the dollar until the mid-90s and the squeeze on wages. The beneficiaries of the pay cuts imposed on workers have been the profits of corporations and the pay packets of better-off; this transfer of resources has been recycled into higher investment and the stock-market boom. </p> <p>So we have had a situation where there has been no shortage of cash to fund new ventures, even those with little chance of commercial success, and no shortage of money to drive shares in these companies to unprecedented levels. Although the pace of expansion under Clinton has been unremarkable when set against those of the 50s and 60s, stock market valuations went crazy.

Financing consumption via stock market gains only holds good while the stock market is going up, and Wall Street has moved sideways this year. Why has it moved sideways? Simple. There has been colossal overinvestment, profits are starting to come under pressure, and the cannier investors are starting to lose their faith in the ability of the hi-technology sector to deliver the earnings that would justify their absurd share prices. Actually, the really canny investors banked their winnings a long time ago. </p> <p>As Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, points out, there are plenty of signs that the economy is slowing. Manufacturing production is slipping back, consumer spending on durable goods and cars has turned down sharply during 2000 and the labour market has started to turn down. With demand slackening but capacity over-abundant, the inevitable is happening. Investment is being cut back and prices are falling. The price of phone calls is falling by 6% a year, with long distance calls falling at an annualised rate of 14.5% in the past six months.

Early cuts in interest rates might just do the trick, but having underwritten the stupidity of investors once, Greenspan will be reluctant to do the same a second time. The economists at Goldman Sachs believe that rates will be kept on hold for the whole of next year, and if they are right the consequence may be a very sharp slowdown indeed, with a plunge in the dollar acting as a further deterrent to easing monetary policy. </p> <p>If this happens, it will provide a suitable epitaph to the Clinton years. As Pollin notes: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and backhanded, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded. But a stratospheric rise in stock prices and debt-financed consumption spree make a mortgaged legacy. Clinton will hand over to his successor the most precarious financial pyramid of the post-war period.\" It could be a good election to lose. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

If this happens, it will provide a suitable epitaph to the Clinton years. As Pollin notes: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and backhanded, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded. But a stratospheric rise in stock prices and debt-financed consumption spree make a mortgaged legacy. Clinton will hand over to his successor the most precarious financial pyramid of the post-war period.\" It could be a good election to lose. Larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

Reports that William Hague was intending to offer Mr Woodhead a place on the Tory benches in the Lords were confirmed by Labour, which said it was aware of the plan. Although no formal offer has been made to Mr Woodhead, who resigned his post on Thursday, it was made clear yesterday that the Conservative leader wants to reward the man whose views have recently embraced many key Tory education policies. The Conservatives believe that it would be a major advantage to have Mr Woodhead as a fierce government critic in the Lords.

In subsequent interviews, Mr Woodhead gave notice that he would become a persistent thorn in Mr Blunkett's side next year, and that he had found it increasingly difficult to defend some aspects of Labour's education policy. Despite apparent sympathy with Conservative education policies, Mr Woodhead insisted last week that he was \"not a Tory\" and that he did not understand \"the rightwing, leftwing polarisation with regard to education\".

Not so long ago, the natural rate of unemployment in the US was said to be 8%. When unemployment came down to 7% without accelerating inflation, the natural rate was redefined as 7%. </p> <p>When unemployment came down to 6%, the natural rate was redefined again. Unemployment is now less than 4% and there is still no sign of accelerating inflation. </p> <p>The same story can be told for the UK. What both economies have demonstrated is the simple Keynesian point that sustained demand expansion can lead to sustained higher output growth without infla tion as long as supply responds and costs don't rise. Euroland would do well to take a leaf out of the Anglo-Saxon book and try the same medicine. </p> <p>In the present benign climate of wage negotiations - a far cry from the turbulent years of the 1970s when the golden age of growth without inflation of the 1950s and 1960s was brought to a sticky end - the most likely check on the growth of output will be the balance of payments. </p> <p>In Britain the deficit to GDP ratio is approximately 2%, while in the US it is 4%. Not even the US can go on borrowing indefinitely, although it is not easy to predict when the world's investors will at long last lose confidence in the strength of the almighty dollar. </p> <p>Until then, faster growth than experienced in the 1970s and 1980s, but perhaps not as fast as the 1990s, should be sustainable provided wage demands do not accelerate. </p> <p>The elasticity of productivity to output growth is not something temporary, and reserves of labour still exist to be tapped. </p> <p>\u0095 The Endogeneity of the Natural Rate of Growth, published in the forthcoming Cambridge Journal of Economics. </p> <p><strong>Tony Thirlwall is professor of applied economics at the University of Kent at Canterbury</strong></p>",

The conventional wisdom in the US and Britain used to be that the inflation rate would take off if output growth exceeded 2.5%-3% because this would push unemployment below some natural rate leading to a wage-price spiral. Experience has shown that the concept of a natural rate of unemployment is a theoretical construct with no empirical counterpart that can be identified. It all depends on wage behaviour. Not so long ago, the natural rate of unemployment in the US was said to be 8%. When unemployment came down to 7% without accelerating inflation, the natural rate was redefined as 7%. When unemployment came down to 6%, the natural rate was redefined again. Unemployment is now less than 4% and there is still no sign of accelerating inflation. The same story can be told for the UK. What both economies have demonstrated is the simple Keynesian point that sustained demand expansion can lead to sustained higher output growth without infla tion as long as supply responds and costs don't rise. Euroland would do well to take a leaf out of the Anglo-Saxon book and try the same medicine. In the present benign climate of wage negotiations - a far cry from the turbulent years of the 1970s when the golden age of growth without inflation of the 1950s and 1960s was brought to a sticky end - the most likely check on the growth of output will be the balance of payments. In Britain the deficit to GDP ratio is approximately 2%, while in the US it is 4%. Not even the US can go on borrowing indefinitely, although it is not easy to predict when the world's investors will at long last lose confidence in the strength of the almighty dollar. Until then, faster growth than experienced in the 1970s and 1980s, but perhaps not as fast as the 1990s, should be sustainable provided wage demands do not accelerate. The elasticity of productivity to output growth is not something temporary, and reserves of labour still exist to be tapped. \u0095 The Endogeneity of the Natural Rate of Growth, published in the forthcoming Cambridge Journal of Economics.

      "bodyText": "The prison officers' representative for Feltham young offenders institution in south-west London has criticised a decision by the prison service not to reveal to officers the findings of an internal inquiry into the racist murder of an Asian inmate. The Prison Officers Association committee at the institution asked on more than one occasion to see the report into the murder of Zahid Mubarek by Robert Stewart, a psychopath with whom he was sharing a cell, but the requests were denied. Last week Stewart was jailed for life for Mr Mubarek's murder, prompting calls for a full independent inquiry into the incident. The decision to withhold the report was taken by Martin Narey, director general of the prison service, who wanted to limit circulation until Mr Mubarek's family had the chance to read and consider its findings. The family was given a copy of the report at a meeting with Mr Narey and Paul Boateng, the prisons minister, last week. But Stephen Gough, an executive committee member of the POA, and the area representative for Feltham, criticised the lack of access. Mr Gough added: \"To exclude us from the loop means that officers cannot be proactive.\" \"It is absolutely right that the family should see the report but if something has gone wrong and needs putting right, then prison officers should see it.\" Mr Gough said that officers at the institution regretted what had happened to Mr Mubarek. But he added that the decision to allow the two men to share a cell was not a \"ground floor decision\" and would have been taken at management level. He said that morale was low among staff at Feltham, and uncertainty over management - there have been four governors in six months - had left officers in a state of limbo.

Exactly 164 days after last year's Champions League final, Vicente del Bosque returned the scouser to his starting line-up for the trip to Numancia on Saturday night. Not that the Man in the Moustache seemed altogether convinced. Launching an audacious challenge on John Gregory's position as undisputed King of Man-Management, Del Bosque claimed that due to injuries \"someone had to play\". </p> <p>And that man was Macca. Surprisingly after such a ringing endorsement, it wasn't a huge shock that his return wasn't enough to rescue a Real side in dire straits. Del Bosque's men have now lost three out of four after falling at home to Mallorca in midweek (2-0) and away to Numancia on Saturday night. </p> <p>Real were poor throughout their trip to Numancia's Los Pajaritos (\"The Little Birds\"), and although Ra\u00fal - dreadful in recent weeks - finally managed to find the net, it was not enough to prevent a shock Numancia victory. Romanian midfielder Larentiu Rosu hit a hat-trick as the side from Soria ran out worthy 3-1 winners. </p> <p>Luckily for Real, none of the major challengers managed to take full advantage. In fact, with a full round of matches in midweek as well the normal weekend games, Zaragoza and Mallorca were the only sides that picked up six points. </p> <p>Valencia blew the chance to extend their lead at the top of the table at Montjuic this weekend, falling to resurgent Espanyol after a late goal from Manuel Serrano. Missing the pace and movement provided by Piojo L\u00f3pez, Farin\u00f3s, Gerard and Angulo (currently on the bench), Valencia have been unconvincing in recent weeks, even though they kept on winning by the odd goal. When you rely on John Carew for goals you court disaster, though. And so it proved. </p> <p>While Valencia have been dull, champions Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a and Radi Antic's Real Oviedo are the sides to watch, with goals galore - at both ends. </p> <p>Diego Trist\u00e1n's hat-trick for Depor saw off Las Palmas in midweek, with injury-returnee Roy Makaay getting the other in a 4-0 win. Javier Irueta's side then travelled to Villarreal on Saturday and went 1-0 and 2-1 up, only to concede two in the last ten minutes to finish up losing 3-2. V\u00edctor, who always seems to score against Depor, was Villarreal's star man - he scored two himself before superbly setting up Mois\u00e9s for the winner. </p> <p>Oviedo, meanwhile, stuck four past Rayo keeper Kasey Keller in midweek (4-1), only to let in the same amount at Alav\u00e9s on Sunday. With that victory Alav\u00e9s lie second despite having fallen to a surprise - and bad-tempered - home defeat, 1-0, against neighbours Real Sociedad on Wednesday night. </p> <p>With all the championship contenders struggling to collect maximum points, Bar\u00e7a's failure to beat Numancia at home on Wednesday suddenly doesn't look so bad. The cul\u00e9s remain concerned about their side's dependence on Rivaldo, though. Luckily, the Brazilian is rather good. He opened the scoring from the penalty spot against Numancia - only for the visitors to find a late equaliser - and he was on target again against Las Palmas on Saturday, coolly leaving the islanders' goalkeeper Nacho (hmmmm, Nachos) Gonz\u00e1lez on the floor before rolling the ball into an empty net. This time a single Rivaldo goal was enough. </p> <p>Barcelona's major problems are at the other end. Lorenzo Serra Ferrer dropped comedy keeper Dutruel for the visit of Numancia in midweek. Luckily, Francesc Arnau proved a worthy replacement, palming Pacheta's 89th-minute free-kick straight into the path of Rub\u00e9n Navarro to level the match at 1-1. </p> <p>This dodgy keeper business seems to be becoming something of a habit. Whatever next? Mark Crossley? Rumours in the Spanish press suggest that Bar\u00e7a are after two teenage goalies: Iker Casillas of Real Madrid and Paul Robinson from Leeds. Well, if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. Perhaps they should look to buy Real Oviedo's Ivan An\u00eda. He made a fine two-handed save to deny Alav\u00e9s a certain goal 20 minutes into his side's visit to the Mendizorroza ground on Sunday. Just one problem - he's a midfielder (and he was sent off).</p> <p>The other two sides in the top six, Celta Vigo and Rayo Vallecano, both won this weekend despite disappointing defeats earlier in the week. Alexandr Mostovoi's return was the key for Celta as they saw off M\u00e1laga on Saturday. Valeri Karpin's deflected shot fell kindly for the Russian, who scored the game's only goal from a position that looked suspiciously offside. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Rayo won 2-1 at home to Valladolid. Josep Setvalls set the home side on the way on the stroke of half-time and Elvir Bolic got the winner five minutes from time after Heinze had looked like getting yet another draw for Valladolid - it would have been their seventh in nine games. </p> <p>Elsewhere this weekend, Osasuna and Athletic Bilbao drew 1-1, while Racing Santander lost 2-0 at improving Zaragoza. Real Sociedad were beaten by Spain's on-form side Real Mallorca (three wins on the trot including Real Madrid and Barcelona), with ex-Bar\u00e7a defender Miguel \u00c1ngel Nadal the hero with a last minute winner. </p> <p>Finally, it seems that the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans' patience with the world's dodgiest chairman, president Jes\u00fas Gil y Gil, has finally worn out. Atl\u00e9ti, 1996 double-winners and relegated from the top flight last season, capped a miserable run at the weekend with a dreadful performance, losing 2-1 at home to Tenerife. </p> <p>That defeat leaves the side in the relegation zone, fourth from bottom. Gil's prediction that this would be \"a year in hell\" is looking hopelessly optimistic. And if they go down again - well, what comes below hell for the Atl\u00e9ti players? Maybe they'll all be packed off to Middlesbrough. </p> <p>Atl\u00e9tico's fans booed their team from the field at the end, but reserved their real fury for the president himself, whom they ever so politely asked to leave. Trouble is, with Gil owning 95% of the shares, a boardroom coup is hardly on the cards.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>SOFT HUTCH</strong></p> <p>\"Without a doubt we are looking at doing more than just staying up,\" said Chris Hutchings on his appointment as manager of Bradford City back in August. He then claimed his managerial style would combine a dash of Bill Shankly, a drop of Brian Clough and a hint of Bill Nicholson. \"They were great managers whose teams always played fantastic football and that's what I want to instil here,\" he said, three months before getting the sack.</p> <p>When the Fiver asked Bradford for confirmation of Hutchings' sacking this afternoon, we were told that \"the phrase we are using is 'relieved of his responsibilities'\". So, the relieving of the responsibilities must have come as no surprise to Bantams fans, who have gone ten games without a win, are in the bottom three, out of the Worthington Cup, and have Stanley Victor Collymore up front (when he's not having his wisdom teeth removed - and surely he needs as many as he can get his jaws on?). Indeed, it was only three defeats ago that publicity-aware chairman Geoffrey Richmond told Hutchings he was living on \"borrowed time\".</p> <p>The club are holding a press conference at 5.45pm today (about 13 hours before most of you receive this mail). It is to be expected that Mr Richmond will make lots of noises about securing the club's Premiership status and finding the right man for the job. But perhaps if the club had done something about that in the summer, instead of trying to get as many big names (remember Benito Carbone?) into the club as possible, they might not already be half-way to the First Division.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IN THE HOLE</strong></p> <p>Last night, the Fiver stayed up until the small hours trying to lay bare the menace that is organised card games. But no matter how hard we tried we could not recreate the moral havoc that single-handedly brought about the collapse of the England team during Euro 2000. Until we summoned the demon Astaroth that is. </p> <p>No, for some reason, over the course of the weekend cards have become football's new bet noir (geddit??). Tabloids have raged about Kelvin Koogan's card school (two pages after offering readers expert tips on the horses). Paul Merson, gambling expert, has warned of the mental changes playing a quick hand of whist can bring about (\"It is so mentally draining. It's on your mind all the time\"). And Kevin Phillips has found it a useful new peg on which to hang his international bitterness (\"If you were not a card player or a racing fan, going away with England could be a bit boring. I used to spend my free time just stuck in my room.\").</p> <p>But who will stand up for the benefits of sitting on a pair of cowboys with a naked ace and a jack in the river? Not to mention having a good hand at poker? Why it's Arsene's Arsenal Wenger. \"When I arrived at Arsenal I changed a number of things but I did not do anything about gambling because I did not see it causing any difficulties,\" said the footballing professor turned moral transgressor. \"I banned alcohol before and after games and I introduced a new dietary system but I did not and do not perceive gambling as a problem.\" Treble aces all around!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Last season there was a bit of a problem in defence early on and we weren't comfortable. The trouble this time isn't just a defensive thing, it is the whole team\" - Yes, that's right Mikael Silvestre. It's the whole team's fault, not yours.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>PADDY'S WHACKED</strong></p> <p>When the Fiver heard that a Liverpool player is to miss the rest of the season after picking up a serious injury against Leeds this weekend, we assumed a slapstick mishap had befallen one of their hapless defenders. Perhaps Sami Hyypia had torn several muscles upon violently mis-kicking at thin air. Had Markus Babbel seriously injured his buttocks after bouncing around on them all afternoon? Or maybe an exasperated Gerard Houllier had stoved Christian Ziege's face in with a cricket bat.</p> <p>But in fact the injured party was Patrick Berger, who badly twisted his knee in a challenge with the otherwise anonymous Mark Viduka. \"I did it when I was trying to tackle Viduka as he was about to score Leeds' third goal,\" explained the midfielder with the air of a man for whom hope and happiness have become alien concepts. \"I was covering as a left-back. I know I could have got to the ball, but suddenly I twisted my knee and I was powerless to do anything.\"</p> <p>As this is the second time this season Berger has knackered his knee, Liverpool have decided to send him to Dr Richard Steadman, an expert who has already tinkered with Jamie Redknapp and PSV Manchester striker Greg van Rusedski. \"I don't know how long I'll be out for,\" moped Berger, \"but once Dr Steadman has opened up my knee and had a look inside he'll decide what I need to do to get fit.\" Sadly, this means the Czech international won't get home to see his family for Christmas - \"that's not looking possible now\" - but he should look on the bright side: at least he won't be blamed the next 26 times his team capitulate.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Manchester United are set to sign Canadian defender Kevin McKenna from German club Energie Cottbus. Twenty-year-old McKenna, who has failed to hold down a first-team place in the Bundesliga this season, could complete a move to Old Trafford this week. Cottbus manager Klaus Stabach said: \"All we have to do now is agree on the transfer fee.

      "bodyText": "SOFT HUTCH \"Without a doubt we are looking at doing more than just staying up,\" said Chris Hutchings on his appointment as manager of Bradford City back in August. He then claimed his managerial style would combine a dash of Bill Shankly, a drop of Brian Clough and a hint of Bill Nicholson. \"They were great managers whose teams always played fantastic football and that's what I want to instil here,\" he said, three months before getting the sack. When the Fiver asked Bradford for confirmation of Hutchings' sacking this afternoon, we were told that \"the phrase we are using is 'relieved of his responsibilities'\". So, the relieving of the responsibilities must have come as no surprise to Bantams fans, who have gone ten games without a win, are in the bottom three, out of the Worthington Cup, and have Stanley Victor Collymore up front (when he's not having his wisdom teeth removed - and surely he needs as many as he can get his jaws on?). Indeed, it was only three defeats ago that publicity-aware chairman Geoffrey Richmond told Hutchings he was living on \"borrowed time\". The club are holding a press conference at 5.45pm today (about 13 hours before most of you receive this mail). It is to be expected that Mr Richmond will make lots of noises about securing the club's Premiership status and finding the right man for the job. But perhaps if the club had done something about that in the summer, instead of trying to get as many big names (remember Benito Carbone?) into the club as possible, they might not already be half-way to the First Division. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IN THE HOLE Last night, the Fiver stayed up until the small hours trying to lay bare the menace that is organised card games. But no matter how hard we tried we could not recreate the moral havoc that single-handedly brought about the collapse of the England team during Euro 2000. Until we summoned the demon Astaroth that is. No, for some reason, over the course of the weekend cards have become football's new bet noir (geddit??). Tabloids have raged about Kelvin Koogan's card school (two pages after offering readers expert tips on the horses). Paul Merson, gambling expert, has warned of the mental changes playing a quick hand of whist can bring about (\"It is so mentally draining. It's on your mind all the time\"). And Kevin Phillips has found it a useful new peg on which to hang his international bitterness (\"If you were not a card player or a racing fan, going away with England could be a bit boring. I used to spend my free time just stuck in my room.\"). But who will stand up for the benefits of sitting on a pair of cowboys with a naked ace and a jack in the river? Not to mention having a good hand at poker? Why it's Arsene's Arsenal Wenger. \"When I arrived at Arsenal I changed a number of things but I did not do anything about gambling because I did not see it causing any difficulties,\" said the footballing professor turned moral transgressor. \"I banned alcohol before and after games and I introduced a new dietary system but I did not and do not perceive gambling as a problem.\" Treble aces all around! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Last season there was a bit of a problem in defence early on and we weren't comfortable. The trouble this time isn't just a defensive thing, it is the whole team\" - Yes, that's right Mikael Silvestre. It's the whole team's fault, not yours. * * * * * * * * * * * * * PADDY'S WHACKED When the Fiver heard that a Liverpool player is to miss the rest of the season after picking up a serious injury against Leeds this weekend, we assumed a slapstick mishap had befallen one of their hapless defenders. Perhaps Sami Hyypia had torn several muscles upon violently mis-kicking at thin air. Had Markus Babbel seriously injured his buttocks after bouncing around on them all afternoon? Or maybe an exasperated Gerard Houllier had stoved Christian Ziege's face in with a cricket bat. But in fact the injured party was Patrick Berger, who badly twisted his knee in a challenge with the otherwise anonymous Mark Viduka. \"I did it when I was trying to tackle Viduka as he was about to score Leeds' third goal,\" explained the midfielder with the air of a man for whom hope and happiness have become alien concepts. \"I was covering as a left-back. I know I could have got to the ball, but suddenly I twisted my knee and I was powerless to do anything.\" As this is the second time this season Berger has knackered his knee, Liverpool have decided to send him to Dr Richard Steadman, an expert who has already tinkered with Jamie Redknapp and PSV Manchester striker Greg van Rusedski. \"I don't know how long I'll be out for,\" moped Berger, \"but once Dr Steadman has opened up my knee and had a look inside he'll decide what I need to do to get fit.\" Sadly, this means the Czech international won't get home to see his family for Christmas - \"that's not looking possible now\" - but he should look on the bright side: at least he won't be blamed the next 26 times his team capitulate. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Manchester United are set to sign Canadian defender Kevin McKenna from German club Energie Cottbus. Twenty-year-old McKenna, who has failed to hold down a first-team place in the Bundesliga this season, could complete a move to Old Trafford this week. Cottbus manager Klaus Stabach said: \"All we have to do now is agree on the transfer fee. Manchester United know what we would like to receive.\" Fulham's \u00a36m bid for giant Czech striker Jan Koller looks almost certain to fail after Anderlecht general manager Michel Vershueren accused Jean Tigana of trying to get Koller on the cheap. \"Firstly, Fulham aren't valuing Jan Koller at his true worth. We'll never let him go for so little,\" Vershueren told La Derniere Heure. \"Apart from that, our Czech deserves better than to develop in that division.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Wembley's twin towers will be demolished with the rest of the stadium, Wembley chief executive Bob Stubbs confirmed today. He said that a bid by Halton Council in Widnes to save the towers had failed because it was too expensive to relocate the structure. Scotland have agreed to play a friendly in Poland next April. Charlton have revealed they lost more than \u00a33m last year - after gambling on an immediate return to the Premiership. \"It is true to say that we took a carefully calculated financial risk by maintaining and then improving the first-team squad in order to gain promotion,\" admitted chairman Richard Murray. \"Consequently I am proud of the fact we celebrate the new Millennium as a Premiership club. \" * * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Uefa Big Cup Weekly (11.30pm) Why the whole country wants Manchester United to stay in the tournament, by Clive Tyldesley.

      "bodyText": "Bowl of cream required The handbag award for bitchiest comment by a media type goes to one M. Jackson of Horseferry Road. Channel 4 boss Jacko unsheathed his claws while banging on about his strategy for further pay-TV ventures at the whizz-bang press launch for new entertainment service E4. \"We don't see any point launching channels for the sake of it,\" pronounced the Jackster solemnly, \"that's known as the Carlton strategy\". Miaow! Low-profile media appearance for Birt Since he quit the BBC to don ermine in the upper house, Lord Birt has been religious about keeping a low profile. So Monkey was privileged to witness his re-entry to the world of media - at the opening of an bustling young marketing firm's new offices last night. Before you commiserate with Circus, Monkey can explain - his daughter apparently works there. Mail hacks defect to Mirror Oh dear, the Daily Mail's well of love just isn't deep enough. Maggie O'Riordan, one of its newsroom stars, is quitting to join the Sunday Mirror as a senior feature writer after a foul-mouthed bust up with an executive. And Alun Palmer former showbiz reporter has been offered a top job at the Mirror - as deputy showbiz editor. No Go Yo Yo Top marks to Flextech Telewest, which is making a stand against the increasing trend for silly names. The newly-merged company commissioned branding consultancy Wolff Olins, the company behind Orange and Go, to come up with a slightly catchier moniker. But Wolff Olins' suggestions - understood to include Circus and Yo Yo -- have all been rejected, leaving Flextech Telewest just months to come up with a new name before the merger is complete. Image consultant The ad industry's most notorious workaholic can kiss his hard-earned reputation goodbye. Images of McCann-Erickson's industrious chief executive, Ben Langdon, sunning himself in St Lucia were beamed into the nation's living rooms at the weekend after he was caught on camera for the BBC's Holiday Guide. Rumours that Mr Langdon engineered the TV appearance himself to show off his newly-trim physique are entirely unsubstantiated. Be afraid... Scarlet fever is alive and well, and sweeping through new weekly mobile magazine Mobile. Editor Glenn Tompkins has been quarantined after contracting the nineteenth-century disease and hypochondriac staff are now fearing for their lives. Could this be the first signs of a plague sweeping the media industry? Trust media to bring back a disease that hasn't been seen for decades. Symptoms to look out for are sore throat, fever, headache, a red rash, delirium and agitation - not much to go on, given that this could apply to just about any old media exec. Signs of a man desperately clinging to his youth, part 1 You are a charming media type, with a sharp dress sense and a beautiful new woman from the telly in your life. So when it comes your leaving bash you need somewhere impressive to entertain your friends and contacts. So can anyone explain just why BBC1 controller Peter Salmon chose The Limelight club (trendy circa 1985) to bid farewell to his chums? Editing life's bowl of cherries Lis Howell, the woman who launched UK Living, is back, and not a day too late. Howell has launched a portal for the over-35s, called bowlofcherrries.com (no, not bowelofcherries.com, which, incidentally, has not yet been registered), and roped in 50 of her celebrity pals to add kudos to the site. Monkey was bemused by a glaring omission in the press release for the site - absolutely no mention of GMTV where Howell spent two years of her life. Could this be a new F-factor in her career - F for forgettability? Email the Media Monkey at monkey@mediatheguardian.com",

Any sane commercial broadcaster would have the ads and the commercial fulfilment one flick of a button away, but many of us argued for a protective cordon sanitaire, that would insulate licence-funded services from commercial ones.

Peering into the future, beyond the period when scheduled networks would roam the earth, we simply did not see how the BBC could survive as a licence-funded broadcaster if we had given away the birthright on the web.

It wasn't just the wall of irrational VC money pouring in to support MBA wet dreams that made me change my mind in '98: I couldn't in the end believe that online was like broadcasting. The market failure arguments did not hold, there is nothing that the BBC is doing online that someone else can't or won't do; the barriers to entry are not as excruciating as they are in TV and radio. Also, given that 80% of the population did not use the service and possibly never would, there was a basic issue of social justice. Should pensioners be forced to pay for well-heeled webbies?

      "bodyText": "Telecoms watchdog Oftel has unveiled pricing proposals intended to take the steep cost out of web surfing. Oftel recommended that the rental BT charges operators for a \"loop\" - the internet line from the local phone exchange to the customer - will be capped at \u00a3118, with a connection fee of \u00a395. Oftel also moved to pre-empt further bickering between BT and rival telecom operators. It says BT will be obliged to help its rivals by installing telephone lines for ordinary customers if there are none available. The regulator hopes to increase the availability of broadband internet services across the UK. Broadband services, expected to launch next year, will offer consumers the opportunity to dial up high-quality video at a high speed. Watchdogs hope the new services will bring increased competition between rivals and drive down prices. David Edmonds, Oftel general director, said: \"I am confident these charges are at a level that will encourage competition in the provision of broadband services.\" A BT spokeperson said the prices were broadly in line with the company's expectations, though it is still consulting the proposals. BT and its competitors can consult Oftel about the charges until December 4, when the regulators will fix the prices. BT has faced heavy criticism for its handling of local loop unbundling and internet access prices, with rival companies, including AOL Europe and Cable &amp; Wireless, complaining about the pace of change. Colt Telecom, which last month protested to Oftel about the progress, said it is reviewing the pricing document, though analysts said it contained no surprises.

      "trailText": "<p>Roused from her dreams by a man from BT and the promise of an ADSL connection,  <strong>Imogen O'Rorke</strong> experiences the joys of broadband internet access - and 24-hour South Park.</p>",
      "byline": "Imogen O'Rorke",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I had been hassling BT Openworld's press office for an ADSL connection since August (allegedly they are so popular with journalists that there's a waiting list stretching up to Christmas). So when, two weeks ago, a phone call came out of the blue from a BT engineer, saying he was round the corner and was ready to fit me up, I didn't even mind that it was 8am and I was still dreaming. After all, I was about to be initiated in the joys of always-on, flat-rate, super-fast broadband access - the internet as God (or Microsoft) had always intended it. </p> <p>In the UK, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is supplied by BT, HomeChoice and a few ISPs, although from next year 14 other companies, including Cable and Wireless, Easynet, Telewest, NTL and MCI Worldcom, will begin installing their equipment in BT's local exchanges and rolling out retail services. The central benefits of BT's IPStream include speeds up to 10 times faster than a good modem, with 500 kbps downstream and 250 kbps upstream, and the ability to use the phone simultaneously, as well as enabling the use of rich media such as webcasts and video clips. </p> <p>The jury is still out on whether ADSL is the most suitable connection for small businesses, let alone domestic use. It has major drawbacks, say its detractors: it's clunky for two-way communications such as video-conferencing; it makes systems highly vulnerable to malicious hacking and as yet BT doesn't offer a Firewall protection plan; it suffers frequently from \"Crosstalk\" (when telecom signals interfere with each other) and \"brownouts\" (when there are bandwidth \"log jams\"), although BT claims these problems will disappear this month when it switches all internet connections to a new network. There are even doubts that BT wants ADSL to become mass market since, as the various \"surftime\" packages have proven, it will put an enormous strain on the network. In some central areas, connection speeds have already dropped by 25% because of broadband, which is \"bandwidth competitive\". </p> <p>Since my surfing habits have been doubling my quarterly phone bill, I worked out that even with the \u00a3150 installation fee and the \u00a339.99 a month USB-type subscription, ADSL would be worth it. Conven tional surftime packages just don't work for freelancers who use the net heavily in the day. </p> <p>One week, six hour-long phone calls to Openworld's support line and several technology-induced tantrums later, having still failed to find anyone who could tell me how I could pick up my email from my existing Demon account through my new BTClick ISP (one even suggested there was a software clash), and having enjoyed only 20 minutes of spontaneous, free-flowing access before the connection disappeared altogether, I was starting to feel like a long-suffering rail commuter in the comfort of my own home. </p> <p>Apparently the local area server was down and it took engineers three days to rectify the problem. It was restored on Monday, only to be replaced by another BT recorded message saying it was \"experiencing network connection problems\" and if I was calling about anything else, I should hang on (what for - a chat?) - at which point, I reverted to using my old 56k modem, which at least I knew I could trust. </p> <p>Admittedly, it is early days for BT, which promises to have overcome all teething problems by the time it hard launches early next year. And you can't really blame the poor techies stuck in a low-rent call centre in Aberdeen. One of them confessed that he had never seen an ADSL connection in his life (they are too remote) and wasn't allowed to surf at work any more since the Orange- gate staff porn scandal - he had nothing but a manual to work from! I am still hugely grateful to Jamie who taught me handy PC-rage tips such as wrapping it in bubble wrap before punching the life out of it and putting a rope around the base of the terminal before throttling it. </p> <p>Technical grouches aside, how did broadband actually enhance my experience of the internet? Ironically, one of the first rich media delights I got to sample (once the servers were up again, and I had downloaded RealPlayer Plus) was a Reuters video news broadcast about how Openworld would \"dramatically influence the way people work\", with secure environments for online transactions, video conferencing, and so on. BT is marketing the business package hard at \u00a399.99 a month. </p> <p>The first noticeable improvement is speed. I am connected at 576,000 bps (10 times faster than usual, although it can drop to 56,000 at certain times of day), and have been for seven hours and 30 minutes. I am listening to an ABC news broadcast about the US election as I type, and simultaneously searching the archives of newspapers. Which is pretty cool. My email problem now resolved, messages flow in and out as easily as water from a tap. There's another one now - probably more spam from sites such as Shockwave, AtomFilms and MP3, to which I now feel obliged to subscribe. </p> <p>The problem with most UK media sites is that they are still stuck in the 20th century - functional, html-based and pretty shallow. I can now listen to any BBC radio channel as I work, which is great, except that ADSL can be disabled by interference from AM signals. I tried in vain to find the promised broadband offerings from the likes of Channel 4, Carlton Interactive and Granada Broadband, but they appear to be months behind schedule. Virtual newscaster Ananova, however, is a total switch-off - like listening to the synthetic female voice of the speaking clock reading a bedtime story, and her green hair and relentless bulletins about the Beckhams make one feel quite queasy. Reuters video news and <a href=\"http://www.ITN.com\">www.ITN.com</a> were exciting for live-action breaking news, with storm reports from around the country, but it has more impact when you watch it on TV. </p> <p> Yet again, you have to look to American sites for a more satisfying streaming media experience. The US has had broadband for a couple of years and there is already a good range of channels such as CNN and ABC news, the Discovery Channel (with live coverage of the Ebola crisis in Africa) and Space.com (the latest transmissions from Mars) and, best of all, Comedy Central, where you can get South Park on tap and Jon Stewart's Daily Show, satirical coverage of the presidential election which has become cult viewing. Download times are 15 times faster - quick enough for you to hang on rather than give up, making the whole experience dangerously addictive. </p> <p>Street.TV, a style and culture channel, is one of the UK's first tentative broadband offerings. But with low-grade live interviews with the likes of singer Sophie Ellis- Bextor and Sadie Frost (yet again) on how great it is being married to Jude, and some non-event fashion show coverage, it's hardly the kind of must-see viewing that would drag you away from Jerry Springer even. Lack of quality control will continue to be a problem with internet media. </p> <p>What the net now does really well is comedy, underground film and satire, as evidenced by the rash of online film and media clubs. There are hours of fun to be had checking out the spoof trailers in <a href=\"http://www.trailervision.com,\">www.trailervision.com,</a> such as American Booty (Man Falls Madly in Love with Fat Ass), the Hollywood spoofs on <a href=\"http://www.Ifilm.com\">www.Ifilm.com</a> (the Oz Witch Project, in which DVD-toting Dorothy gets Toto, Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow into a spot of bother in the woods, is a brilliant foil to Blair Witch 2), and <a href=\"http://www.Shockwave.com\">www.Shockwave.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MediaTrip.com\">www.MediaTrip.com</a> are great for pop video spoofs and new animation. There is no doubt that the new South Park is out there somewhere. </p> <p>Good British sites such as <a href=\"http://www.thejunkies.com\">www.thejunkies.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.madcowTV.com\">www.madcowTV.com</a> are beginning to sprout, but it will be another six months before broadband content is good enough to justify an ADSL connection in the home (and before the prices become competitive). In the short term, the most obvious consumer benefit would be multi- terminal connections for libraries and schools, but at the current price it is unlikely to happen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I had been hassling BT Openworld's press office for an ADSL connection since August (allegedly they are so popular with journalists that there's a waiting list stretching up to Christmas). So when, two weeks ago, a phone call came out of the blue from a BT engineer, saying he was round the corner and was ready to fit me up, I didn't even mind that it was 8am and I was still dreaming. After all, I was about to be initiated in the joys of always-on, flat-rate, super-fast broadband access - the internet as God (or Microsoft) had always intended it. In the UK, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is supplied by BT, HomeChoice and a few ISPs, although from next year 14 other companies, including Cable and Wireless, Easynet, Telewest, NTL and MCI Worldcom, will begin installing their equipment in BT's local exchanges and rolling out retail services. The central benefits of BT's IPStream include speeds up to 10 times faster than a good modem, with 500 kbps downstream and 250 kbps upstream, and the ability to use the phone simultaneously, as well as enabling the use of rich media such as webcasts and video clips. The jury is still out on whether ADSL is the most suitable connection for small businesses, let alone domestic use. It has major drawbacks, say its detractors: it's clunky for two-way communications such as video-conferencing; it makes systems highly vulnerable to malicious hacking and as yet BT doesn't offer a Firewall protection plan; it suffers frequently from \"Crosstalk\" (when telecom signals interfere with each other) and \"brownouts\" (when there are bandwidth \"log jams\"), although BT claims these problems will disappear this month when it switches all internet connections to a new network. There are even doubts that BT wants ADSL to become mass market since, as the various \"surftime\" packages have proven, it will put an enormous strain on the network. In some central areas, connection speeds have already dropped by 25% because of broadband, which is \"bandwidth competitive\". Since my surfing habits have been doubling my quarterly phone bill, I worked out that even with the \u00a3150 installation fee and the \u00a339.99 a month USB-type subscription, ADSL would be worth it. Conven tional surftime packages just don't work for freelancers who use the net heavily in the day. One week, six hour-long phone calls to Openworld's support line and several technology-induced tantrums later, having still failed to find anyone who could tell me how I could pick up my email from my existing Demon account through my new BTClick ISP (one even suggested there was a software clash), and having enjoyed only 20 minutes of spontaneous, free-flowing access before the connection disappeared altogether, I was starting to feel like a long-suffering rail commuter in the comfort of my own home. Apparently the local area server was down and it took engineers three days to rectify the problem. It was restored on Monday, only to be replaced by another BT recorded message saying it was \"experiencing network connection problems\" and if I was calling about anything else, I should hang on (what for - a chat?) - at which point, I reverted to using my old 56k modem, which at least I knew I could trust. Admittedly, it is early days for BT, which promises to have overcome all teething problems by the time it hard launches early next year. And you can't really blame the poor techies stuck in a low-rent call centre in Aberdeen. One of them confessed that he had never seen an ADSL connection in his life (they are too remote) and wasn't allowed to surf at work any more since the Orange- gate staff porn scandal - he had nothing but a manual to work from! I am still hugely grateful to Jamie who taught me handy PC-rage tips such as wrapping it in bubble wrap before punching the life out of it and putting a rope around the base of the terminal before throttling it. Technical grouches aside, how did broadband actually enhance my experience of the internet? Ironically, one of the first rich media delights I got to sample (once the servers were up again, and I had downloaded RealPlayer Plus) was a Reuters video news broadcast about how Openworld would \"dramatically influence the way people work\", with secure environments for online transactions, video conferencing, and so on. BT is marketing the business package hard at \u00a399.99 a month. The first noticeable improvement is speed. I am connected at 576,000 bps (10 times faster than usual, although it can drop to 56,000 at certain times of day), and have been for seven hours and 30 minutes. I am listening to an ABC news broadcast about the US election as I type, and simultaneously searching the archives of newspapers. Which is pretty cool. My email problem now resolved, messages flow in and out as easily as water from a tap. There's another one now - probably more spam from sites such as Shockwave, AtomFilms and MP3, to which I now feel obliged to subscribe. The problem with most UK media sites is that they are still stuck in the 20th century - functional, html-based and pretty shallow. I can now listen to any BBC radio channel as I work, which is great, except that ADSL can be disabled by interference from AM signals. I tried in vain to find the promised broadband offerings from the likes of Channel 4, Carlton Interactive and Granada Broadband, but they appear to be months behind schedule. Virtual newscaster Ananova, however, is a total switch-off - like listening to the synthetic female voice of the speaking clock reading a bedtime story, and her green hair and relentless bulletins about the Beckhams make one feel quite queasy. Reuters video news and www.ITN.com were exciting for live-action breaking news, with storm reports from around the country, but it has more impact when you watch it on TV. Yet again, you have to look to American sites for a more satisfying streaming media experience. The US has had broadband for a couple of years and there is already a good range of channels such as CNN and ABC news, the Discovery Channel (with live coverage of the Ebola crisis in Africa) and Space.com (the latest transmissions from Mars) and, best of all, Comedy Central, where you can get South Park on tap and Jon Stewart's Daily Show, satirical coverage of the presidential election which has become cult viewing. Download times are 15 times faster - quick enough for you to hang on rather than give up, making the whole experience dangerously addictive. Street.TV, a style and culture channel, is one of the UK's first tentative broadband offerings. But with low-grade live interviews with the likes of singer Sophie Ellis- Bextor and Sadie Frost (yet again) on how great it is being married to Jude, and some non-event fashion show coverage, it's hardly the kind of must-see viewing that would drag you away from Jerry Springer even. Lack of quality control will continue to be a problem with internet media. What the net now does really well is comedy, underground film and satire, as evidenced by the rash of online film and media clubs. There are hours of fun to be had checking out the spoof trailers in www.trailervision.com, such as American Booty (Man Falls Madly in Love with Fat Ass), the Hollywood spoofs on www.Ifilm.com (the Oz Witch Project, in which DVD-toting Dorothy gets Toto, Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow into a spot of bother in the woods, is a brilliant foil to Blair Witch 2), and www.Shockwave.com and www.MediaTrip.com are great for pop video spoofs and new animation. There is no doubt that the new South Park is out there somewhere. Good British sites such as www.thejunkies.com and www.madcowTV.com are beginning to sprout, but it will be another six months before broadband content is good enough to justify an ADSL connection in the home (and before the prices become competitive). In the short term, the most obvious consumer benefit would be multi- terminal connections for libraries and schools, but at the current price it is unlikely to happen.",

Respondents to the ITC survey found it difficult to measure the actual effects of TV on kids, but agreed that programmes and advertising could influence behaviour in both positive and negative ways. WWF wrestling, South Park, Power Rangers and, to a lesser extent, The Simpsons were mentioned as having actual or possible undesirable influences on children. The ITC study, Copycat Kids?, concluded that TV was a secondary, but powerful influence on children. The report found that the media and especially TV, along with sport, pop music, computer games and hanging out with friends, formed the main components of youth culture. Copycat Kids? also identified some aspects of TV advertising that increase the chances of children imitating what they see: behaviour which is easy to copy; a familiar or accessible situation; an easily understood storyline or scenario; potential for emotional empathy; intrigue and challenge; wicked or forbidden things; participants who \"get away with it\"; humour and jokes; well-known characters, role models or celebrities; products relevant to or appealing to a child; advertisements shown at an accessible time for the relevant age group; high production values - eg colour, music, action.",

Surgery began early this morning after a protracted legal battle over the ethics of the case. The girls' parents had said God should decide their fate, but doctors prevailed in the courts by arguing that both twins would die if they did not act. A huge team of doctors, nurses, anaesthetists and other health workers are involved in the complex surgery, which will result in an uncertain future even for the stronger sister. Mary is certain to die as soon as the aorta she shares with Jodie is severed during the surgery. Jodie's heart and lungs are keeping both girls alive through blood vessels which connect them. Experts predict Jodie has a 5% risk of dying on the operating table, but after that her problems will be functional rather than life threatening. Medical opinion varies but doctors say there is a chance she could be doubly incontinent and will need to have reconstruction of her rectum, sexual organs and lower abdomen. She will need extensive skin grafts - possibly using tissue from her dead sister - and is expected to spend the first five years of her life in hospital. Extensive X-rays and scans of the twins were taken in a bid to gain as much knowledge as possible of what they would find when surgery began, but there was still uncertainty about the exact extent of their condition. What is known is that the girls are joined at the lower abdomen, with their spines fused, and that they share Jodie's heart and lungs. Mary has a heart but it is useless and her lungs never inflated after her system failed at birth. While Jodie is considered to be functioning normally, Mary has a primitive brain and her life was not considered by doctors to be \"viable\". Cases of conjoined twins are so rare - around one per 100,000 live births - and the ways in which they can be joined so different, that there is little precedent for this latest case. In the UK, only Great Ormond Street hospital in London and St Mary's hospital in Manchester, where the twins' operation is taking place, have any experience of separating conjoined twins. At St Mary's, all three attempts have resulted in the deaths of the twins. Closed circuit television is being used during the operation so that teams of specialists can watch its progress while preventing overcrowding of the operating theatre. There will inevitably be a moment of silence as Mary's life ebbs away, and the battle to save Jodie begins in earnest.

Mainstream news and current affairs programmes on TV and radio have \"ignored\" or failed to understand the business agenda, Mr Dyke said today. Mr Dyke said there had not been enough programmes that explained the complexities of business or introduced personalities to ordinary viewers. His comments will be seen as an implicit attack on Peter Jay, the corporation's economics and business editor until this summer. Mr Jay, who was hired by John Birt, was rarely seen on screen and was criticised by many observers for his \"lecturing\" style of delivery. Speaking at the Confederation of British Industry's national conference in Birmingham, the BBC boss said he believed coverage of business on radio and television over the past 20 years had not been good enough. He said: \"Whilst the coverage of politics and international affairs has been first class, the coverage of business hasn't always been of the same quality.\" Mr Dyke, who said he wanted to see better business journalism when he took up the post early this year, added that he came from a generation which was suspicious or even hostile to business. Few people thought about a career in business but the number of A-level students taking business studies had doubled in the past seven years and that there was much more interest in the subject. Mr Dyke is himself an entrepreneur who made a fortune from business. He was unemployed at 30, but went on to become a millionaire after he and the current chairman of the BBC, Sir Christopher Bland, drew up a lucrative share option scheme at LWT. This summer Mr Dyke created the BBC's first business division, headed by Robert Thirkell, the man behind Troubleshooter and Blood on the Carpet. He also announced changes at The Money Programme, which now concentrates on only one subject each week. Mr Dyke made a number of changes to the BBC's coverage of business issues including a doubling in length of the Working Lunch programme on BBC2 and an expansion of business stories on BBC Online. He added that he was aiming to develop a daily early morning business programme on television.",

      "body": "<p>If, in the final accounting, I am remembered for nothing else, at least I will be remembered as the man who ruined literature once and for all. Of course there are those who will argue that Jackie Collins beat me to this long ago - and she may in fact have won in the distaff category - but according to more than a few folks here in America, I am the winner. So if you're looking for some way into the record books, look elsewhere. The blame for the ruination of the literary form known as the novel has been laid at my feet, so bugger off - this one's mine. </p> <p>How did I do it? Simple. I became the first novelist to use product placement in a work of fiction. Product placement, for you literary purists, is a form of advertising previously restricted to the famously whorish mediums of television and film. One of the earliest and most famous examples of product placement was in Steven Spielberg's 1982 film ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. </p> <p>The way I understand it, the script originally called for the kids in the story to use M&amp;M candies to lure the wrinkled little space guest into their home. However when the producers contacted the candy-maker and suggested it pay for the privilege of having its product featured in the film, the candy-maker balked. So the producers contacted the maker of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and asked if it would be interested. It was, and sales of Reese's soared when the film was released. Ever since, film- makers and advertisers have expanded their unholy alliance. Now, when MI6 gives James Bond a BMW you can rest assured that somebody gave one to the film's producer as well. </p> <p>Flash forward 16 years. I'm in the throes of writing Cross Dressing, a satire on religion and advertising. My research has me neck-deep in obscure Catholic theology and modern advertising theory when a thought occurs to me. Sadly, it isn't an idea about character development or an ingenious plot twist. Rather it is about how to get some publicity for the book's release. </p> <p>Why would such crass considerations ever cross my mind? The answer is, again, simple. I'm in the business of writing books. Unfortunately it's not enough just to write them; they must be marketed as well. And, in the US at least, publishers are not famous for how well they market the books of their mid-list authors. Without marketing, fewer people know about your book. When fewer people know about your book, fewer buy it. When fewer people buy your book, you'll soon be looking for a new publishing contract. Thus the crass consideration. </p> <p>Before my first novel (Pest Control) was published I asked what sort of publicity campaign the publisher would do for it. My agent said it would send copies to reviewers and hope for the best. Fortunately, debut novels are considered newsworthy - especially when they sell to a major Hollywood studio as Pest Control did - and thus the book received a fair amount of attention in the press. </p> <p>Before my second book, The Organ Grinders, was published I was told to lower my expectations about press coverage. As my US publicist explained, \"Author publishes second novel\" isn't considered a newsworthy item. Without a good angle, I was told, it was nigh impossible to get PR for a second novel not written by a best-selling author. </p> <p>I was left to my own devices to find an \"angle\" for Cross Dressing. As I said, it came to me while writing. Since my protagonist is a hotshot in the advertising business and since much of the book satirises American hyper-consumerism, I thought it might be considered \"newsworthy\" (and ironic) if I made Cross Dressing the first novel to feature product placement. </p> <p>My US editor loved the idea, but said I would have to make the deal on my own as the company wouldn't have a clue where to start. After a few quick calls I had a list of companies interested in helping to make literary history. On the list was a fast-food chain, a cosmetics company and a liquor distributor. For reasons of artistic integrity and pure laziness I wanted a product that was already in the book. I felt this strategy would shield me from accusations of writing to accommodate a \"sponsor\", while simultaneously saving me the trouble of writing any new pages. </p> <p>The novel doesn't feature anyone enjoying fast food or applying cosmetics, but there were a few scenes involving cocktails. Then another idea hit me. I had sold the book's film rights to Universal Studios. Universal (at the time) was owned by Seagrams. Two calls resulted in a deal wherein I would replace references to generic drinks with various Seagrams products. </p> <p>Now, before all this happened, I was under the impression that money changed hands in a product placement deal. Since I was doing this for publicity, not cash, I thought I might do the deal for a single dollar, or I would donate the money to a charity. However, when I discovered the deals were typically done in exchange for the \"placed\" product (in this instance, hooch) I had to re- evaluate my position. It would be more than a little insensitive to send a couple of cases of single malt scotch to the Diseased Liver Association, am I right? So I accepted (and disposed of) them in my own selfless way. </p> <p>Just before the book came out, my publisher sent copies of Cross Dressing to magazines and newspapers, with letters explaining the product placement deal in the hopes of generating some publicity. It worked. Brill's Content and Publisher's Weekly did articles on the deal. Time magazine and Entertainment Weekly both made mention of it as well. </p> <p>The only problem was, no one seemed to get the joke. It was clear from the articles that certain people in the book world were taking exception to the deal. The gist of what they were saying was that I had cheapened either literature in general, or the novel form in particular. </p> <p>For example, in Sean Gullette's article for Brill's Content (June 2000), Jonathan Galassi, editor-in-chief at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, is quoted as saying about the deal, \"Well, I think it's pretty lame.\" </p> <p>Well, imagine my shame. Such a stinging indictment was hard to swallow, but what really bothered me was that poor Johnny boy just didn't get it. And he wasn't alone. Since so many are having a problem getting this, allow me to explain. </p> <p>Cross Dressing lampoons the advertising industry. To do something as brazen as product placement in something as sacred as a novel is to make a joke on the subject. Now, had I done a product placement deal in a book that had nothing to do with advertising, that would have been selling out. As I said earlier, if I'd had to add drinking scenes to the book to accommodate the product, that, too, would have been selling out. But what I did was to name the drinks that were already in the book - in fact the names are so overstated in ad-speak as to be a joke. Get it? In a book ridiculing advertising? Ta-da! Irony. </p> <p>While I had anticipated a mild backlash to the deal, it never occurred to me anyone would attack it so viciously. I mean the notion that my product placement deal could harm literature in some way that my novels hadn't already done was just plain silly. As if by this time next year, Annie Proulx will be revising her latest manuscript to oblige a corporate sponsor, substituting a nicely placed scene involving the \"new condom for cowboys\" at the expense of mood or real character development. </p> <p>\"But Bill,\" someone cried, \"doesn't this deal fundamentally cheapen the novel as a form of literature?\" No, of course not. You want to know what does? The pitiful advances so many novelists get. That's what cheapens the novel. But me? I lack the influence, thank you very much. </p> <p>Still, some tut-tutting critics say I crossed a line no one else had dared to cross before. As if there are thousands of authors out there who had considered doing a product placement deal for their novel, but decided the whole transaction would sully literature and, thus, in defence of the Muses they decided not to do it. </p> <p>Pur-leeze.

      "bodyText": "If, in the final accounting, I am remembered for nothing else, at least I will be remembered as the man who ruined literature once and for all. Of course there are those who will argue that Jackie Collins beat me to this long ago - and she may in fact have won in the distaff category - but according to more than a few folks here in America, I am the winner. So if you're looking for some way into the record books, look elsewhere. The blame for the ruination of the literary form known as the novel has been laid at my feet, so bugger off - this one's mine. How did I do it? Simple. I became the first novelist to use product placement in a work of fiction. Product placement, for you literary purists, is a form of advertising previously restricted to the famously whorish mediums of television and film. One of the earliest and most famous examples of product placement was in Steven Spielberg's 1982 film ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. The way I understand it, the script originally called for the kids in the story to use M&amp;M candies to lure the wrinkled little space guest into their home. However when the producers contacted the candy-maker and suggested it pay for the privilege of having its product featured in the film, the candy-maker balked. So the producers contacted the maker of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and asked if it would be interested. It was, and sales of Reese's soared when the film was released. Ever since, film- makers and advertisers have expanded their unholy alliance. Now, when MI6 gives James Bond a BMW you can rest assured that somebody gave one to the film's producer as well.

      "body": "<p>Let's cut straight to the picnic table in the boot. You don't often see one of those. Not one with legs and everything. Certainly not in a small car. But Suzuki - responding to what must have been an extraordinarily specific piece of market research, or perhaps one using focus groups who were hungry at the time - has put a picnic table in the boot of the new Ignis. </p> <p>It's under the floor and, yes, it looks more like a plastic box at first sight. But it lifts out and you can ask your dealer to supply legs. And then you can go about the place, confident that, as a driver, you will never again need to eat sandwiches off the ground in the lifetime of your Ignis. </p> <p>The pull-out picnic table is very Suzuki - kind of useful, but also a bit barking at the edges. This, remember, is the company that brought us hordes of road-burning motorcycles and the quad bike. According to a Suzuki publication - The Corporation and the People, a glossy but extremely thorough document which takes the trouble to incorporate colour photographs of, among other things, the company's incinerator and its sludge recycling facility - the Suzuki philosophy, in a Japanese nutshell, is \"value-packed products\". Well, say what you like, but here is a car which costs less than \u00a37,000 for a bottom-of-the-range three-door model and which comes with removable garden furniture as standard. Value-packed or what? </p> <p>The Ignis looks like a Fiat Punto after two years of military service. Where cars are concerned, military service is all the rage. A surprisingly large portion of the new car market goes for inspiration to the Jeep or, in the case of some of the bigger Mitsubishis and Hyundais, to the amphibious personnel carrier - anything, really, which might have seen action in Korea. It's an arresting fact about transport in our time that, however ostensibly peaceful their ambitions as drivers, many people now expect their vehicles to look combat-ready. </p> <p>Suzuki's bold but plausible plan with the Ignis seems to be to try to shrink-wrap this cultural tendency around the chassis of a small car. It looks like a Grand Vitara (Suzuki's chunkiest and most bellicose people carrier) which has accidentally been put in with the hot wash and has come out a third of the size. </p> <p>As with any miniaturising - except, possibly, the shrinking of human heads by cannibals - a degree of cuteness inevitably sets in. Suppressing the urge to whistle the theme from Postman Pat every time I climbed into the Ignis was a perpetual struggle. The luggage bars on the roof could almost be handles. The Ignis appears, disconcertingly, to be the die-cast model of the car, rather than the real car itself - a Dinky collectible. </p> <p>Would you give it shelf-room? Well, it's likably snub-nosed at the front, pleasantly anonymous at the back, and sensibly frippery-free. There is, for instance, no remote locking device, so owners will have to refamiliarise themselves with an ancient and valuable ritual, little practised these days, known as \"putting the key in the door and unlocking the car yourself\". It feels oddly unnecessary at first, but one soon gets the hang of it. </p> <p>The interior is, inevitably within this price range, a small homage to functional grey plastic and serviceable cloth. Holders for drinks are moulded into the shelf under the dashboard, which may not be the most sensible use of limited space, given the amount of times one has to find space for drinks in a car compared with the amount of times one has to find space for things which aren't drinks. And in any case, you would have thought that those who would gorge and water themselves while driving were already amply provided for with the picnic table. </p> <p>It's a peculiarly slippery car to drive. Strictly speaking, a 1.3-litre engine could pull two cars of this weight without complaining too much. As the Ignis's engine is merely obliged to deal with one, and hooked up to power steering, it shoots off towards the horizon almost of its own volition. You're somewhere up around 45mph even before you have got out of second. And anyone who makes it to fifth in an Ignis in an urban area is surely within minutes of being pulled over and breathalysed. </p> <p>Suzuki is about to launch a competition rally model of the three-door Ignis. Doubtless the rally drivers will work out what to do about the suspension.

      "bodyText": "Let's cut straight to the picnic table in the boot. You don't often see one of those. Not one with legs and everything. Certainly not in a small car. But Suzuki - responding to what must have been an extraordinarily specific piece of market research, or perhaps one using focus groups who were hungry at the time - has put a picnic table in the boot of the new Ignis. It's under the floor and, yes, it looks more like a plastic box at first sight. But it lifts out and you can ask your dealer to supply legs. And then you can go about the place, confident that, as a driver, you will never again need to eat sandwiches off the ground in the lifetime of your Ignis. The pull-out picnic table is very Suzuki - kind of useful, but also a bit barking at the edges. This, remember, is the company that brought us hordes of road-burning motorcycles and the quad bike. According to a Suzuki publication - The Corporation and the People, a glossy but extremely thorough document which takes the trouble to incorporate colour photographs of, among other things, the company's incinerator and its sludge recycling facility - the Suzuki philosophy, in a Japanese nutshell, is \"value-packed products\". Well, say what you like, but here is a car which costs less than \u00a37,000 for a bottom-of-the-range three-door model and which comes with removable garden furniture as standard. Value-packed or what? The Ignis looks like a Fiat Punto after two years of military service. Where cars are concerned, military service is all the rage. A surprisingly large portion of the new car market goes for inspiration to the Jeep or, in the case of some of the bigger Mitsubishis and Hyundais, to the amphibious personnel carrier - anything, really, which might have seen action in Korea. It's an arresting fact about transport in our time that, however ostensibly peaceful their ambitions as drivers, many people now expect their vehicles to look combat-ready. Suzuki's bold but plausible plan with the Ignis seems to be to try to shrink-wrap this cultural tendency around the chassis of a small car. It looks like a Grand Vitara (Suzuki's chunkiest and most bellicose people carrier) which has accidentally been put in with the hot wash and has come out a third of the size. As with any miniaturising - except, possibly, the shrinking of human heads by cannibals - a degree of cuteness inevitably sets in. Suppressing the urge to whistle the theme from Postman Pat every time I climbed into the Ignis was a perpetual struggle. The luggage bars on the roof could almost be handles. The Ignis appears, disconcertingly, to be the die-cast model of the car, rather than the real car itself - a Dinky collectible. Would you give it shelf-room? Well, it's likably snub-nosed at the front, pleasantly anonymous at the back, and sensibly frippery-free. There is, for instance, no remote locking device, so owners will have to refamiliarise themselves with an ancient and valuable ritual, little practised these days, known as \"putting the key in the door and unlocking the car yourself\". It feels oddly unnecessary at first, but one soon gets the hang of it. The interior is, inevitably within this price range, a small homage to functional grey plastic and serviceable cloth. Holders for drinks are moulded into the shelf under the dashboard, which may not be the most sensible use of limited space, given the amount of times one has to find space for drinks in a car compared with the amount of times one has to find space for things which aren't drinks. And in any case, you would have thought that those who would gorge and water themselves while driving were already amply provided for with the picnic table. It's a peculiarly slippery car to drive. Strictly speaking, a 1.3-litre engine could pull two cars of this weight without complaining too much. As the Ignis's engine is merely obliged to deal with one, and hooked up to power steering, it shoots off towards the horizon almost of its own volition. You're somewhere up around 45mph even before you have got out of second. And anyone who makes it to fifth in an Ignis in an urban area is surely within minutes of being pulled over and breathalysed. Suzuki is about to launch a competition rally model of the three-door Ignis. Doubtless the rally drivers will work out what to do about the suspension. The company speaks lyrically about the 6.5-inch clearance between the road and the bottom of the Ignis (offering greater clearance, apparently, than any other car in the class) but even so, I'm not sure exactly how durable the standard road model would prove in extreme circumstances. At one point, seeking a potential picnic-table opportunity on one of the wilder roads around Barnes Common in London, I hit an open drain. The jolt was so severe that I have yet to recover fully the sense of feeling in my upper body. Better with the Ignis, I think, to stay close to smooth roads and well-lit places. And forget about going to war. It's only a little car, after all. The lowdown Suzuki Ignis 1.3 GL Price: from \u00a36,995 Top speed: 99.4mph Maximum torque: 110Nm @ 5,500 rpm Consumption: 44.14mpg At the wheel: Ken or Barbie On the stereo: Livin' Doll En route for: Legoland",

Oddly, this is a Thursday - not the most obvious night on which to introduce a new channel aimed at the under-34s.</p> <p>But the key to this seemingly strange decision is the appearance in the opening night schedule of the first episode of the new (seventh) series of Friends, followed by a new episode of ER. </p> <p>A straight lift, in other words, from Sky One's \"must-see TV\" Thursday night schedule (which, in fairness, was itself a straight lift from NBC). It was Sky, of course, which rather bitterly pulled out of the bidding for the satellite rights to Friends and ER when the multi-million pound price tag became too rich. In its first year E4 is spending \u00a340m on programming. </p> <p>Besides Friends and ER, E4 will be screening The Sopranos, Sex in the City, and Dawson's Creek, plus such home-grown entertainment shows as So Graham Norton, Da Ali G Show, Smack the Pony and Trigger Happy TV. Many will screen on E4 first, with the US shows on Channel 4 six months later. </p> <p>The under-34s targeted by E4 are an audience who can react with enthusiasm, commitment and, crucially, disposable income to a channel which treats them properly. Sky One, with its annual budget of \u00a366m, has spent 10 years slowly increasing its market share, aiming at establishing itself as the multi-channel world's (necessarily younger) equivalent of ITV. E4, according to Adam Smith of Zenith Media,\"represents the most serious challenge yet to Sky One in that aim\". </p> <p>Acknowledging the new channel's debt to Sky, Channel 4's entertainment supremo Kevin Lygo (who doubles up as E4's controller of programming) is unashamed. \"Give people what they want,\" he shrugs. Mark Sharman, Sky's director of broadcasting, responds: \"Wherever you look we face increasing competition, including UK Gold. But we are widening our demographic up to 50.\" They are also specifically targeting women with new UK drama and spending on original production has risen by 60% under him. </p> <p>Sky One's other main threat, the youth-oriented BBC3 which will grow from the ashes of BBC Choice, is at least nine months away from getting its act together. Which gives E4, buoyed by the exclusive rights to not only Friends and ER but this year's Emmy victor, The West Wing, a chance to streak ahead. </p> <p>With a launch marketing budget of \u00a310m, far in excess of anything the BBC could muster, Dan Brooks, E4's marketing head, can proclaim that the newcomer is \"the last big channel launch in this country\". All the other genres - sport, film, children's and factual - are full, he claims. Though if Channel 4's plans to launch a racing channel hadn't been put on hold by a rights battle, that statement might have been different. </p> <p>E4's launch will be based on a viral internet campaign (isn't everything aimed at the under-35s, these days?), but Brooks has a far more valuable and absolutely free marketing tool at his disposal - access to Channel 4's airtime. The obvious point to plug E4 will be at 7pm as Channel 4's after-school teen programming gives way to the news. T4 - the successful youth zone created by Andi Peters which occupies Sunday mornings on Channel 4 and houses Dawson's Creek and the Hollyoaks omnibus - will go to five nights a week. Anchored by the achingly hip Dermot O'Leary, it may be partly simulcast on Channel 4 and E4. Presumably with plenty of cross-promotion. </p> <p>Though C4 chief executive Michael Jackson confirmed the go-ahead at last week's press launch, there was more than a touch of a wing and a prayer in his presentation. Success depends on distribution, getting E4 into as many of the 9m multi-channel homes in the UK and Ireland in January. </p> <p>Yet the only agreement signed so far is with NTL, the UK's largest cable operator, (1.2m TV homes). Deals with Telewest and ONdigital are said to be imminent. Spending \u00a340m on programming for a channel which little more than a million homes can receive seems excessive, but every new channel launch is dogged by \"nearly\" signed carriage deals up to the day of its launch and most are signed fairly soon after. </p> <p>Just like Sky One, E4 is a hybrid pay service. It is expected to justify the \u00a3100m investment being ploughed into the TV channel and linked website by securing a combination of advertising revenue and subscription income - the latter calculated in pence per month paid back to Channel 4 by the distributor for each subscriber home the channel reaches. The amount of pence per subscriber varies from service to service, and fixing this tariff and getting the channel on to basic subscription packages together provide scope for endless haggling. Negotiations with Sky - by far the largest distributor - have inevitably been coloured by the fact that Sky One is E4's main rival. </p> <p>Gerry Bastable, head of Channel 4's pay TV team, says he \"expects\" the channel to be on all platforms. \"Our experience with Film Four [which launched two years ago] was that we ended up signing distribution deals with Sky and ONdigital a few days before launch, and with NTL afterwards.\" BSkyB's focus, he says, is on the bottom line. \"They have to be absolutely sure what they are getting. Until we firmed up our plans, it was difficult for us to give them chapter and verse. There's a long tradition of terrestrial broadcasters not really cracking it. We've tried to learn from their mistakes.\" </p> <p>Though there have been rumours of joint venture discussions with partners ranging from Paramount Comedy Channel to Warner Brothers and of course Sky, Channel 4 is currently going ahead with E4 as a wholly-owned venture (Emap is a partner in the E4 website). Significantly, though, Bastable says a partner has not been ruled out. Sky likes to take equity stakes of 50% in the channels it distributes, though Film Four, as a premium \u00a35.99 per month service, was given the kid glove treatment and remains wholly owned by Channel 4. </p> <p>A deal would allow Channel 4 to recoup its investment more quickly and harness Sky's formidable marketing and subscription team (the people who ring you up at home and ask if you'd like to subscribe to Film Four. No? Well how about a free three-month trial?), who have helped take Film Four subscriptions to a pro jected 400,000 by Christmas. The conflict centres on the key issue of how valuable E4 is in relation to Sky One: if Sky One is priced, say, around 80p per home per month, is E4 worth 40p, or more or less? How much is access to Friends worth? This year an episode of Friends recorded 2.9m viewers, Sky One's biggest audience ever, ahead of ITV and BBC1 in satellite and cable homes. </p> <p>The truth is that the first year will be experimental. \"We want to get it up and running,\" says Bastable. \"It has a very close relationship with Channel 4 and we want to figure out how it works. The whole thinking is about taking Channel 4's reputation and expanding on it.\" </p> <p>\"It's a balance. We don't want to take away from Channel 4,\" says Andrew Newman, head of E4 programmes. \"The big American shows are there to bring in the ratings. And the new shows are there to do something for the landscape. Our new commissions have to be distinctive and get talked about for having bottle.\" </p> <p>Lygo says all the shows made for E4 will be screened on Channel 4. He adds that \"someone may make a new show for Channel 4, and it may be we'll decide to premiere it on E4\". He cites Dylan Moran's new sitcom, Black Books, which has struggled on Friday night against BBC2's Buzzcocks. \"We could get a wind behind something, get people talking\". Already Channel 4 has adopted one of E4's ideas to make video diaries from contestants on the castaway gameshow, Shipwrecked. </p> <p>Channel 4's entertainment budget under Lygo, now \u00a370-75m, will clearly play a big part in bolstering E4, as will access to its distinctive archive. \"In Year one it will change all the time,\" Lygo says. The stars associated with Channel 4 have been squared, he says: \"They want to be part of E4\". </p> <p>However, the benchmark for an E4 show performing well (100,000 viewers, compared with 2m for Channel 4) may put some off. Newman thinks audiences can be much bigger. The E4 schedule (see panel) has been designed to work with, rather than offer full-blooded competition to, the parent channel. Channel 4 concentrates its entertainment on Wednesday and Fridays, so E4 will target Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays. It's all so beautifully complementary, put like that. But what if you love Friends and ER but just happen to be aged 40, like Bastable? </p> <p>\"While our core audience is 16-34, that's shorthand, really, for people who have the Channel 4 values and attitudes, the young in spirit,\" he says. Profits aren't projected until after five years of operation. Bastable adds: \"Financially, we are trying to be commercially grounded, but we do have other objectives, such as retaining C4's relevance in a multi-channel age.\" </p> <p> Of E4's \u00a340m programme budget, just over half is for acquired shows. But some 350 hours a year of new programming will be made. The aim is to spend around \u00a340,000 per half-hour - not significantly different from the terrestrial programme budgets of Channel 5 - and learn the lesson of BBC Choice: it's better to make fewer programmes with decent budgets than lots of cheap rubbish. </p> <p>Channel 4 must prove with this launch that it can roll out a popular digital channel. Film Four's income may be high but there is no shortage of doubters questioning its churn rate. E4 must secure and retain a substantial audience to pay its way - and there will always be those who doubt whether a public service channel with a remit to serve disenfranchised minorities should be launching commercial entertainment channels and outbidding Sky for the rights to US shows. </p> <p>At the launch, Jackson pointed to the expansion of digital channels in Britain and said: \"Channel 4 can't afford to stand still in this changing landscape, and we don't intend to.\" E4 would be \"salient and relevant\" to its audience. It was not a rival to Sky One, but a station aimed at the Channel 4 core audience. \"It will be intelligent and youthful in attitude.\" </p> <p>It's true that there will be more in E4 for its target audience than there is on Sky One - and there will be none of the Fox-produced car crash clip shows that drag down the latter's schedule. But Jackson's claim that there is no rivalry looks like a clear case of wishful thinking. </p> <p><strong>Wooing the under-34s: indicative E4 schedule</strong></p> <p><strong> 4-8 pm: </strong> T4 teen zone, including Popworld (live music show), Dawson's Creek, US high school docu-soap and next-day repeats of C4 shows: Hollyoaks, Shipwrecked, As If (new urban teen soap), The Secret Life of Us (Australian 'Dawson's Creek meets This Life meets Cold Feet' drama) </p> <p><strong> 8-9 pm:</strong> Blind Date (US version), Channel 4 repeats (eg Smack the Pony, Party of Five). </p> <p><strong> 9-10 pm:</strong> First-run US drama and comedy: Friends, ER (Tuesday and Thursday), Ally McBeal, Sex in the City, The West Wing, The Drew Carey Show (sitcom) <strong> 10-11 pm:</strong> New British entertain ment (12 series commissioned, including first run of new series of Trigger Happy TV). </p> <p><strong> 11-11.30pm: </strong> Generation E - original youth documentaries. Expect lots of sex-related material. </p> <p><strong> 11.30pm-4 am:</strong> Channel 4 archive - The Word, Eurotrash, Graham Norton, Oz, Queer as Folk, Father Ted. </p> <p><strong> In development now:</strong> Camper Van - Five gays hit the road to journey from LA to New York. Touches of Ibiza Uncovered. </p> <p><strong> In production now: </strong> 5 Go Dating - five young women and five men come to London, live in adjacent houses, must date each one, report back on 25 dates, and what they said about each other.</p>",

Channel 4 concentrates its entertainment on Wednesday and Fridays, so E4 will target Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays. It's all so beautifully complementary, put like that. But what if you love Friends and ER but just happen to be aged 40, like Bastable? \"While our core audience is 16-34, that's shorthand, really, for people who have the Channel 4 values and attitudes, the young in spirit,\" he says. Profits aren't projected until after five years of operation. Bastable adds: \"Financially, we are trying to be commercially grounded, but we do have other objectives, such as retaining C4's relevance in a multi-channel age.\" Of E4's \u00a340m programme budget, just over half is for acquired shows. But some 350 hours a year of new programming will be made. The aim is to spend around \u00a340,000 per half-hour - not significantly different from the terrestrial programme budgets of Channel 5 - and learn the lesson of BBC Choice: it's better to make fewer programmes with decent budgets than lots of cheap rubbish. Channel 4 must prove with this launch that it can roll out a popular digital channel. Film Four's income may be high but there is no shortage of doubters questioning its churn rate. E4 must secure and retain a substantial audience to pay its way - and there will always be those who doubt whether a public service channel with a remit to serve disenfranchised minorities should be launching commercial entertainment channels and outbidding Sky for the rights to US shows. At the launch, Jackson pointed to the expansion of digital channels in Britain and said: \"Channel 4 can't afford to stand still in this changing landscape, and we don't intend to.\" E4 would be \"salient and relevant\" to its audience. It was not a rival to Sky One, but a station aimed at the Channel 4 core audience. \"It will be intelligent and youthful in attitude.\" It's true that there will be more in E4 for its target audience than there is on Sky One - and there will be none of the Fox-produced car crash clip shows that drag down the latter's schedule. But Jackson's claim that there is no rivalry looks like a clear case of wishful thinking. Wooing the under-34s: indicative E4 schedule 4-8 pm: T4 teen zone, including Popworld (live music show), Dawson's Creek, US high school docu-soap and next-day repeats of C4 shows: Hollyoaks, Shipwrecked, As If (new urban teen soap), The Secret Life of Us (Australian 'Dawson's Creek meets This Life meets Cold Feet' drama) 8-9 pm: Blind Date (US version), Channel 4 repeats (eg Smack the Pony, Party of Five). 9-10 pm: First-run US drama and comedy: Friends, ER (Tuesday and Thursday), Ally McBeal, Sex in the City, The West Wing, The Drew Carey Show (sitcom) 10-11 pm: New British entertain ment (12 series commissioned, including first run of new series of Trigger Happy TV). 11-11.30pm: Generation E - original youth documentaries. Expect lots of sex-related material. 11.30pm-4 am: Channel 4 archive - The Word, Eurotrash, Graham Norton, Oz, Queer as Folk, Father Ted. In development now: Camper Van - Five gays hit the road to journey from LA to New York. Touches of Ibiza Uncovered. In production now: 5 Go Dating - five young women and five men come to London, live in adjacent houses, must date each one, report back on 25 dates, and what they said about each other.",

Anywhere else it would be surreal. But this is Radio 1, Britain's premier youth station. </p> <p>Here reside the latest additions to the Radio 1 team: the beneficiaries of the radio arm of the BBC Talent drive launched earlier this year. They are Becci Abbott, Kasey Clarke, Lee Edmenson, Natasha Lynch, Andy Taylor and Antonia Wright. Aged 18 to 24, they capture the older end of the Radio 1 target audience (15-24) but - like so many of their co-workers - they reflect the station's stance on having a workforce that mirrors the interests and ages of listeners. </p> <p>The trainees, who have won year-long contracts, will spend the first six months shifting between departments, and the final six specialising in the area in which they have shown potential. They have been at the London base for less than three weeks. </p> <p>Mary, the PR who is chaperoning them during our interview, takes me to \"the chill-out room\" where they're waiting. \"They're a lively bunch,\" she says as she ferries me down the stairs, past framed pictures of Zoe, Jamie, and the saluting Sara; past machines dispensing Skittles and M&amp;Ms, and into the dimly lit den, decked out with bean-bags, furry footrests and play-stations, where the group is waiting. </p> <p>Teeth are sure to grind at the sight of the successful six. The BBC had more than 16,500 applications, which were whittled down to 400 for the second stage and 56 for the interviews from which the final group were chosen. </p> <p>Asked if they always wanted to work in media, five of them say yes. Two were also drawn to the TV application, including 18-year-old Becci, who auditioned but claims it put her off TV work. \"I did the children's TV one and they said to me 'be cheesy' and it was so fake.\" She bursts into an over-animated impression of herself: \"'Hi! I'm Becci!' - God, it was horrible.\" </p> <p>Lee is the oldest. While the others had only recently left education with their sights set on the media, he had a career carved out as a welder on Formula 1 cars.

I was happy to get through all those people. That was a buzz in itself.\" </p> <p>Not yet familiar with the intrica cies of Auntie's expected protocol, the trainees' enthusiasm doesn't always throw up such fawning answers. I see the PR's face twitch when they compare notes on the application process: how the online application form was confusing; how they were told they'd hear by the end of July but heard nothing until mid-August; how they received interview invitations addressed to somebody completely different. For the BBC it was a bureaucratic nightmare, not helped by the criticisms that, with so many eager - and experienced - youngsters out there, the BBC Talent drive was a waste of time and money. </p> <p>When I ask how they would respond to the accusation that they have taken a bit of a short-cut, they are outraged and bombard me with justifications: \"We worked very hard\", \"We had to prove ourselves\", \"We had to answer a psychometric questionnaire\", \"and design a radio show.\" \"And besides,\" says Andy, leaning forward, \"a lot of people get in through short cuts and people they know.\" Mary butts in, \"It is perceived,\" she says, \" perceived .\" </p> <p>Suddenly, Andy Parfitt, controller of Radio 1, arrives at the door.

      "body": "<p><strong> Favourite sites?</strong> <br> Obviously boo.com is my favourite. At the moment, I tend to spend a lot of time in our community area, chatting to other users. I always loved the original boo.com when I could get full access to it. Beyond visiting boo, I spend a lot of time on news sites. In terms of where I spend my money, there's Expedia for my travel and Amazon for my books. And I've been surfing sex sites because we're looking to bring sex content onto boo. </p> <p> <strong> Last online purchase? </strong> <br> A jacket from Ted Baker. I shop online for clothing quite a lot. </p> <p> <strong> Most recent technological faux pas? </strong> <br> I came to London with a new cell phone but I couldn't get international service so I was unreachable for a few days. Prior to that, I spilt water on my keyboard. </p> <p> <strong> Main news sources on the web?</strong> <br> BBC Online because it covers the world fairly well, and provides deep coverage of the UK. Wall Street Journal online has different editions, European as well as American. And the New York Times, which is my homepage. </p> <p> <strong> Most persistent spam emailer? </strong> <br> I've done a good job of keeping that out of my work mail. But skiareas.com targets my personal aol mailbox quite a lot, although I don't mind. It reminds me of the days when I had time to go skiing. </p> <p> <strong> Time spent on web? </strong><br> I'm online all day. It's just a function of my job. Even in meetings, I tend to end up in front of some site or another. </p> <p> <strong> Next boo.com/clickmango? </strong> <br>I strongly believe that this Christmas season is going to be the last great wave of cleansing on the internet. There are people hanging on, but post-holiday you're going to see an enormous amount of people that don't survive. But I think it's good. It's very Darwinian, if you will. </p> <p> <strong> Least useful site/s on web? </strong><br> People's personal websites. </p> <p> <strong> Most useful site/s? </strong><br> Any site that is providing you information on what you're about to buy in addition to giving you the opportunity to purchase. Amazon is great for that. </p> <p> <strong> What screensaver do you use?</strong> <br> It's a quote from the original Miss Boo: \"I can work 24 hours a day without getting bored. I can be everywhere at once and not confuse myself with God.\" </p> <p> <strong> Most irritating thing about the web? </strong> <br>The vastness of it.</p> <p><strong> Do you bother with old media?</strong> <br> Oh yeah. I read newspapers and books, and I go to see films. I'm very much a tactile person. I adore having people around me. I don't think the web replaces that. </p> <p>Kate Buggeln is president of the recently relaunched boo.com</p>",

      "bodyText": "Favourite sites? Obviously boo.com is my favourite. At the moment, I tend to spend a lot of time in our community area, chatting to other users. I always loved the original boo.com when I could get full access to it. Beyond visiting boo, I spend a lot of time on news sites. In terms of where I spend my money, there's Expedia for my travel and Amazon for my books. And I've been surfing sex sites because we're looking to bring sex content onto boo. Last online purchase? A jacket from Ted Baker. I shop online for clothing quite a lot. Most recent technological faux pas? I came to London with a new cell phone but I couldn't get international service so I was unreachable for a few days. Prior to that, I spilt water on my keyboard. Main news sources on the web? BBC Online because it covers the world fairly well, and provides deep coverage of the UK. Wall Street Journal online has different editions, European as well as American. And the New York Times, which is my homepage. Most persistent spam emailer? I've done a good job of keeping that out of my work mail. But skiareas.com targets my personal aol mailbox quite a lot, although I don't mind. It reminds me of the days when I had time to go skiing. Time spent on web? I'm online all day. It's just a function of my job. Even in meetings, I tend to end up in front of some site or another. Next boo.com/clickmango? I strongly believe that this Christmas season is going to be the last great wave of cleansing on the internet. There are people hanging on, but post-holiday you're going to see an enormous amount of people that don't survive. But I think it's good. It's very Darwinian, if you will. Least useful site/s on web? People's personal websites. Most useful site/s? Any site that is providing you information on what you're about to buy in addition to giving you the opportunity to purchase. Amazon is great for that. What screensaver do you use? It's a quote from the original Miss Boo: \"I can work 24 hours a day without getting bored. I can be everywhere at once and not confuse myself with God.\" Most irritating thing about the web? The vastness of it. Do you bother with old media? Oh yeah. I read newspapers and books, and I go to see films. I'm very much a tactile person. I adore having people around me. I don't think the web replaces that. Kate Buggeln is president of the recently relaunched boo.com",

She has worked flat out, spending weekends in the office, to get the website, bowlofcherries.com, up and running on time. The website, a community-focused magazine site for over-35s with something of a celebrity edge, made its debut, as planned, last Tuesday. </p> <p>The five partners in the company - Ola Steinsrud, David Hurst, Jane McCormick, Alyson Pearce and Howell herself - each stumped up cash to get the venture off the ground, and a private investor, a friend Howell declines to name, managed to ramp up the total launch fund to \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Howell is chief executive; Hurst, previously publishing director of Financial Times Business, is managing director. McCormick, who has worked as a journalist for the Sun, the Sunday Mirror, the Sunday Express, GMTV and Reuters, is editor-in-chief. Pearce, who has experience in showbusiness, the media and the hospitality industry, is events director.

She says that the project is safe until Christmas, by which time it needs to have established a good revenue model. </p> <p>Howell may have a strong record in TV but, as everyone has learned from the past year, the internet is a whole different ball game, and top teams don't necessarily equal automatic success. However, if energy and enthusiasm could guarantee success in the cut-throat world of the internet, bowlofcherries would be an instant success story. </p> <p>But who's to say it won't be a success? With a strong, experienced management team behind it, a good well-researched niche market to target and no malevolent venture capitalist on its back, it perhaps stands a better chance than many. It has already got off to a springing start, with, according to Howell, almost 100 pre-launch subscriptions taken out. At \u00a3100 a pop for a year's members' benefits, that's a nice \u00a310,000 in the bank after its first week. </p> <p>\"The site has hit a nerve already and we're starting off with no debt because we've covered all the start-up costs with our own money. We've done our research and we know there is a market out there for us,\" says Howell, reeling off some research bowlofcherries commissioned from BMRB in the summer. More than 10.5m people over 35 now use the internet for pleasure; 7% said they would pay a subscription if they thought it gave them something; they constitute the fastest growing sector of the internet; and they know what they want - mainly relevant information and good conversation. To this end, bowlofcherries aims to provide users with information about everything from decorating and gardening to cooking and travel, top-and-tailed with a bit of celebrity opinion. The company is entering a market that has yet to be tapped. While the number of websites for people over 45 or under 25 has spiralled, no one has yet developed a website targeted at both sexes over 35.</p> <p>Other revenues from advertising and e-commerce will kick in later, but the subscription-based model should give bowlofcherries a good foundation on which to build. Additionally, the site has signed e-commerce and content deals with Tesco, the RAC and Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, the upmarket gift shop. </p> <p>For their \u00a3100, bowlofcherries club members will get a free gift from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and an organised social calendar, including wine tastings, tennis tournaments and weekly cocktail parties where club members can meet the 50 personalities who write for the site. Members also have access to experts (such as a personal celebrity shopper) and get discounts on some goods.</p> <p>Club members will even be encouraged to strike up personal email conversations with the stars - a list that includes Toyah Wilcox, Michael Cole, Fern Britton, Edwina Currie and Jilly Johnson - who will be writing for the website. </p> <p>The rest of the website and all the content are free, but Howell says that the celebrity involvement and the weekly parties are its unique selling point. \"It's not about glamour, it's about conversations,\" she says. </p> <p>Howell says she's having the time of her life and now sees the TV industry as stale and unwilling to change with the times.

      "bodyText": "Amateur investors are heaving a sigh of relief following bumper profits at Carphone Warehouse, Europe's largest mobile phone retailer. The group said first half turnover was up 62% to 447.9m, with pre-tax profits at \u00a321m, against \u00a36.7m last year. The figures are good news for the thousands of people who bought Carphone shares at 200p when the company floated in July, but were subjected to a three-month sale lock-in. Jittery shareholders could only watch as the shares fell to a low of 144p, and must be hoping that today's figures push it into profit. Shares were up 1.3% at 190.5p in early trading. The group defended the time restrictions, which did not apply to big financial institutions, saying it would calm the market volatility that had hit recent IPOs. Charles Dunstone, chief executive of Carphone, said the group's growing number of store left it well-positioned for the Christmas shopping rush. The company already has just over 1,000 outlets in 14 countries. \"The increased penetration rates, the future technology changes and the forecast growth of the replacement handset market all play to the Carphone Warehouse's positioning of simple, impartial advice,\" added Mr Dunstone. The group's MViva wireless internet portal, which runs in the UK, France, Spain, Sweden and Holland had 30,000 customers by the end of September. Carphone Warehouse is extending its reach beyond handset sales with the portal, and has invested \u00a334m in new technologies through its Wireless Internet Services fund.",

The surgery at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, will almost certainly mean the death of the weaker twin Mary but should give her sister Jodie the chance of a relatively normal life. In a statement the hospital said: \"We can confirm the operation is taking place today.This complex operation is expected to last approximately 15 hours and involves a team of up to 20 staff.\" The twins were born in August and the original timetable for the operation was that it should be carried out in the first three months of the twins' lives. On Friday, the Prolife Alliance failed in two dramatic court attempts to halt the operation. First the high court, and then the court of appeal, rejected an application to have the official solicitor, Laurence Oates, removed as Mary's legal guardian and replaced by the Alliance's director, Bruno Quintaville. The separation is the climax to a legal battle which started nearly three months ago. Doctors went to the high court in August and won the right to separate the twins despite their parents objections. They are devout Roman Catholics from the Maltese island of Gozo and are opposed to the operation on religious grounds. In September they launched a privately funded appeal against the high court decision which they subsequently lost. The twins are joined at the abdomen with arms and legs at right angles to their conjoined upper bodies. Their spines are fused.

      "body": "<p>It took me less than a minute to make the 20-yard walk from Studio S1 of Television Centre to my desk at the Today programme. It was 6.35am one Thursday in the middle of September and, as ever, my mobile phone was ringing. \"Your report was wrong. We demand a correction.\" It was the duty Downing Street press officer. I inquired what the problem was and then suggested that there was nothing to apologise for. </p> <p>A short while later the phone rang again. It was Joe Irvine, John Prescott's special adviser. \"You're talking off the top of your head,\" he shouted. Again, I talked it through with him. Every 15 minutes or so over the next hour, I heard more of the same from different members of the government media machine. They even faxed me a statement, setting out the words I should use for my \"correction\". </p> <p>At about 7.30am, I phoned Alastair Campbell. I had called him late the previous evening - I tried to call either him or his deputy, Godric Smith, most evenings. The same went for any of the Tories - Amanda Platell, Nick Wood or Andrew Scadding. The night before, Campbell had been cooperative and polite. That morning was different. </p> <p>\"I'm fed up with the garbage you've been putting out. Where's your social responsibility? You're just regurgitating the Daily Mail.\" I told him I had been particularly busy that morning fielding calls from his people, and hadn't yet got round to reading the Mail. </p> <p>\"I'm not going to talk to you until you get into that studio and apologise,\" he continued. At 8.10am, Alan Milburn was the government minister on the block. He began by making clear, from what sounded suspiciously like a written text, that he would like to correct the erroneous impression I had given earlier in the programme. (You can rarely tell nowadays whether politicians are using crib sheets, as they tend to use remote studios rather than travel to W12 for interviews.) </p> <p>The crime I had committed happened to be on the day the fuel blockades were coming to a head. Nerves were understandably fraught. At 6.30am I had reminded listeners of John Prescott's assertion, early in the life of this government, that he would have failed in his job had he not reduced the number of journeys made by car. I asked, rhetorically, what had happened to the government's green agenda of prising people out of their vehicles and on to public transport. What the officials insisted I had said was \"pricing people\" out of their cars. They had misheard me. Either way, I didn't see what the difference was. Any government serious about dealing with our third-world transport system would have been braver about stating its intentions. But, no, ministers were now going out of their way to make it clear that they had never wanted to harm the floating-voter car-driver. </p> <p>That morning was an extreme example of something that happened almost every day of my 16 months as the Today programme's political correspondent. Sometimes the complaints contained fruity expletives. I became so used to the monster phone call - from all sides - that mornings weren't quite the same if my mobile or pager remained silent. </p> <p>There were two reasons for the hypersensitivity - the programme itself, and what I was trying to do on it. I saw my role as part reporter, setting out the day's agenda, and part commentator/analyst. In doing so I frequently sailed close to the wind. The staple of the job is the so-called \"6.30\". For those who haven't heard it - and I must confess that until I joined the BBC I had never listened before 7am - the slot is supposed to be a briefing by three or four correspondents of the top stories of the day. And politics, for better or worse, is invariably one of them. On average I would then have one or two more slots in the course of the rest of the programme, sometimes a package, sometimes another live. I interpreted my job as explaining what is really going on - sometimes through an original story, sometimes an original take on the mainstream story. And, of course, when you take risks, you make mistakes. When I got facts wrong I tried to correct them later in the programme. When that was impossible, I would phone or write to whoever made the complaint. Where I would not budge was on a piece I knew to be right but difficult for one side to take. </p> <p>Another example: last February, Today did a special programme from Brussels. This was a conspicuous attempt to take a sceptical (in the original sense of the word) look at the EU, its institutions and British policy. The programme led to a five-page letter of complaint from Campbell. He was most annoyed with my 8.10am package, leading into an interview with Robin Cook, in which I set out all the various contradictions in government policy, quoting various ministers from other countries as expressing frustration at the UK's inability to move on the euro or other issues. </p> <p>Such complaints lead to much soul-searching at the corporation. A reply was drafted, seeking to rebut each point line by line. Instead the decision was taken to send an extremely short reply, making clear that all the facts had been looked into, but the BBC rejected the criticism and said it had no intention of going down the route of a deconstruction of every package that is transmitted. Such responses are absolutely vital. More often than not BBC journalists complain of managers caving in under pressure. </p> <p>It is not that every complaint by a politician is wrong; far from it. Sometimes ministers are not given enough time to make their points before being pummelled by a presenter; sometimes the programme might try too hard to get an item picked up by the Press Association and followed up later by the papers. Sometimes ministers are tackled on something outside their remit, and not on the issue they thought they were coming on to discuss. But these are matters of judgment, not conspiracy or bias. Ministers have dropped the line they tried at the start of this government that the Today programme is no longer important; Tony Blair once, famously, said that he preferred to watch GMTV. </p> <p>The problem is that far too often the spin doctors, the advisers and the politicians themselves are just trying it on. They will do virtually anything. I remember Gordon Brown's effervescent spinner, Ian Austin, saying to me down the telephone line, without a hint of irony: \"What you should really be saying in your piece is that the Chancellor is prudent for a purpose.\" Sometimes they will go to a junior producer on the desk to get something changed; sometimes they will complain only after the event to a particular executive they know. I always preferred the in-your-face approach. I would have a good laugh with John Reid, the Scottish Secretary and unofficial minister for the Today programme, each time he went on to the programme to slag off a piece I had just done. </p> <p>Sometimes they refuse to appear - Robin Cook has tried this route several times; more recently, so has William Hague. Sometimes it is because a particular politician refuses to debate with another politician; sometimes it is in protest at their treatment the previous time they were on. </p> <p>One former minister, who usually took part from remote studios, boasted to me that once, when he didn't like the way an interview was going, he pressed the \"hang up\" button. I could not tell whether or not he was having me on. Sometimes there are fraught negotiations about who appears for the government. \"No, we don't want Margaret Beckett for the third day running,\" the night editor might tell the Downing Street press officer. \"Then we won't put anyone up,\" comes the reply. It becomes a game of brinkmanship. </p> <p>And sometimes it comes down to internal BBC rivalry - the Today programme has a tendency to stand politicians down at the last minute after finding out that they have had the temerity to do an interview on Newsnight the night before. The uncomfortable truth is that politicians need \"Toady\", as it is known at the BBC, as much as the programme needs them. </p> <p> Politicians who don't try it on - such as Jack Straw, David Blunkett and Michael Portillo - tend to come off best. The special advisers and press officers, who are perhaps more subtle - who realise that some days they win, some days they lose - are the ones who are listened to most. </p> <p>Yet, the larger the general election looms, the more they - the spinners of all parties, all interest groups - will try to bludgeon programmes into submission. After all, the tactic has so often worked in the past. On many news outlets there has been a culture of caution, the bland, the \"on the one hand, on the other\" school of journalism too often seen as the best means of achieving balance. There has been little incentive for correspondents to stick their necks out. The Today programme, The World at One and Newsnight have tried to go against the grain. </p> <p>The corporation has whole armies of executives whose job it is to fret about the output. One old hand said to me, after a piece I did about Mo Mowlam and her problems with Downing Street: \"Very interesting. Very controversial. Are you sure you got your facts right?\" They worry about politicians. But they particularly worry about the press. Each morning, huge piles of cuttings arrive for each executive, containing every mention of the BBC over the previous 24 hours. Papers are regarded with unhealthy reverence. They are seen as founts of all wisdom when they break political stories and, far too often, criticism of the corporation leads to anguished meetings. </p> <p>Ultimately it comes down to what people want the output to be. Many politicians want it just to regurgitate what they say. They maintain it is not the job of the BBC journalist to interpret. But what may have been right in the past may not be right now. Recent appointments suggest that the BBC may be becoming more confident in dealing with controversy, more robust in taking on those who complain. It could, at a time when it most needs it, rediscover a new model for public service broadcasting - to reconnect viewers and listeners with politics by, perish the thought, being more brave, more interesting. To coin another Prescott phrase: traditional values in a modern setting. </p> <p>\u0095 John Kampfner is an author, commentator and broadcaster.</p>",

My vision for our paper was to turn it into the Daily Telegraph of university publications, which was a really bad idea, because the Daily Telegraph is by most measures a very good newspaper and we were by most similar measures really terrible journalists. Anyway, students generally want to read stories about the mice in their halls of residence rather than travel features about Czechoslovakia. (We did both, and I know which one now makes me cringe when I look at it.) </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Birmingham University's student magazine was never shortlisted under my stewardship in the Guardian's annual student media awards.

My vision for our paper was to turn it into the Daily Telegraph of university publications, which was a really bad idea, because the Daily Telegraph is by most measures a very good newspaper and we were by most similar measures really terrible journalists. Anyway, students generally want to read stories about the mice in their halls of residence rather than travel features about Czechoslovakia. (We did both, and I know which one now makes me cringe when I look at it.) Unsurprisingly, Birmingham University's student magazine was never shortlisted under my stewardship in the Guardian's annual student media awards.

The conglomerate Hinduja Group, which has made a bid in the region of \u00a3120m, is in discussions with Trinity Mirror to handle distribution of the titles if its bid is successful.",

In Britain's merciless political culture, he is malevolently eyeing the men and women ensconced in Downing Street. The nation's infrastructure is falling apart. Even the CBI bosses admit Britain resembles a banana republic. Ergo this government is not competent. Labour officials can reasonably claim that, in this cocktail of crises, they have responsibility without power. The railways are suffering from decades of under-investment and a form of privatisation only considered practicable by lawyers, accountants and Tory think tanks. Equally, if motorists see a petrol queue and feel magnetised to join it, they have only themselves to blame for wasting their own time. And if the rain is the most persistent since the 19th century, can this really make Blair's the worst government since Gladstone's? On occasion, at times of crisis, the British rally round, conjure up the Dunkirk spirit and have a laugh. Unfortunately, the modern electorate seems to be a less forgiving beast. Labour promised to make the trains run on time, yet they can hardly make them run on the rails. Blair jacked up petrol duty for two years, at a time when world oil prices were just starting their slow ascent to the roof and beyond. The quantity of rain that is falling on Britain may not be a matter for cabinet collective responsibility, but what happens to the water after it falls is another issue - especially if local councils seem too bureaucratic to help. It all just adds to the fed-up factor. So Tony Blair knows it would be fatal for a prime minister to shirk responsibility, even for acts of God. After all, even acts of God - and the Dome - happen on Blair's watch. Fortunately for governments, the main way they assert power is through getting and spending - the budgetary process. By chance, later this week, in his pre-budget report, chancellor Gordon Brown will have the ideal stage on which to show the country that ministers are still shaping events rather than being shaped by them.

The modern-day man from Snowy River might be a park ranger. But their stock is far from iconic today, after rangers in helicopters shot 617 wild horses in Guy Fawkes national park, 300 miles north of Sydney. The National Parks and Wildlife Service wants to cull another 2,000 wild horses in the Snowy Mountains Kosciusko national park, further south. But New South Wales' environment minister Bob Debus last week ordered the suspension of all culling of feral horses in national parks while an independent review of the practice is conducted. Local people were enraged after discovering badly mutilated carcasses scattered across the park. \"The manner in which these horses were killed was absolutely barbaric. It was damned murder - that's what it was,\" said landowner Greg Everingham. Mr Everingham contacted the RSPCA, which claimed it discovered several bullet-riddled horses had survived the cull to stagger on for another day. Arriving on ships with the first white settlers in 1788, more than 300,000 feral horses now roam Australia. Affectionately called brumbies, after James Brumb - a famous horse breeder who released horses into the wild in 1804 - they are part of the country's landscape and literature, even appearing alongside other Australian icons at the Olympic opening ceremony. Across the arid wastes of the Northern Territory, 130,000 horses are shot each year. Conservationists insist that the feral horses are pests, reaching plague proportions in many areas, where they damage biodiversity, displacing all kinds of native flora and fauna, from gum trees to kangaroos. They also fear that some local farmers are slipping their horses into the national parks, where they can feast on prime, untouched grazing land. \"We're getting falsely sentimental over feral horses while the native wildlife that the parks are established to protect are forgotten about. It's a ridiculous situation,\" said Noel Plumb of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness. \"Horses are very hard hooved whereas Australian native animals have soft pads. \"Many of our soils are poor and easily erodable, so when large mobs of horses move about these landscapes they quickly do a lot of damage,\" Mr Plumb explained. The horses congregate around water, trampling banks, fouling water and damaging aquatic life and the water habitats of unique mammals such as platypuses. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said its first aerial cull was long overdue and had only been made possible after bush fires had cleared out undergrowth, enabling helicopters to track and kill the horses. Conservationists also pointed out that it is during periods where trees and plants sprout back after fires that native plants are most vulnerable to being eaten by the horses. However, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) said that aerial culling should only be considered in Australia's dry open plains, where helicopters could easily track and put down injured animals without causing undue suffering. \"The very rugged forest terrain in the Guy Fawkes national park is not suitable for this because of the obvious difficulty in conducting the operation in the most humane manner possible,\" said vice president Dr Garth McGilvray. Animal welfare groups suggest that birth control methods could be a more humane alternative to sharpshooters in helicopters. But this requires horses to be rounded up, which is deemed impractical after 17 attempts to round up wild horses in New South Wales national parks in the last decade only resulted in the culling of around 150 horses. It is also claimed that the slow and expensive mustering of horses is more stressful than aerial culling. AVA president Dr Tony English is leading the inquiry into the culling.

      "body": "<p>When you are running your own business, your evenings are often not your own. The other week we attended an evening function hosted by one of our venture capitalists. </p> <p>Primarily intended as a report to their own investors, it was a rare and fascinating opportunity for us to meet the people whose money it is that we are working with - the investors' own investors. It was also a bit of a treat for us to see our investors justifying their activities rather than us justifying ours, for once. </p> <p>The main body of the evening was spent with a presentation from the venture capitalists reviewing their investment year. This included a brief overview of each of the companies in the investment portfolio. It felt peculiar watching someone else, in this case the VC's representative on our board, give a presentation on our business. </p> <p>You could also tell from the tone of these presentations - whether the company was being talked up or whether expectations were being set somewhat lower - how positively the VC viewed the respective businesses. This was a key measure of perceived progress, particularly as a number of these business, including our own, were still in the euphemistically termed \"pre-revenue\" stage. </p> <p>There were also questions from the private investors. Among these, the general downturn in the value of internet stocks was the hottest topic. But a number of questions were addressed directly to representatives of the companies in attendance. We seemed to attract a disproportionate share. </p> <p>The most persistent questioning concerned the public relations risks of launching a product for teenagers - particularly one that dealt with online purchasing. The fear was that we could be accused of encouraging irresponsible spending. </p> <p>We needed to persuade the private investors - many of whom had teenage children - that we could deal with it. We had to start working for our wine and nibbles. </p> <p>The nature of the discussion that followed reinforced for us the level of sensitivity that exists around delivering products for teenagers. This was brought into even starker relief last week when internet chatrooms, another online service that is incredibly popular with teenagers, made headlines after a teenage girl who had befriended and then been assaulted by a paedophile she met in an online chat room. </p> <p>Chat rooms are inherently difficult to supervise. After all, anonymity and the ability to be someone else is a key part of the attraction for youngsters - you don't get conversations between DodgySheep and GlitterBabes in real life. </p> <p>We do not have a chat room at Rools, but our partners at Teenfront.com have just launched one. </p> <p>As a service for teenagers by teenagers they are simply responding to demand - for a long time now chat has been the service most requested by users in feedback that they have submitted via the Teenfront.com site. </p> <p>Teenfront.com tries to protect users of the chat room by displaying clear guidelines for use, employing watchers to monitor the rooms and by banning transgressors. It is relatively easy to do while they are small but is going to require tight management as they grow. </p> <p>Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools, an online payments service for teenagers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When you are running your own business, your evenings are often not your own. The other week we attended an evening function hosted by one of our venture capitalists. Primarily intended as a report to their own investors, it was a rare and fascinating opportunity for us to meet the people whose money it is that we are working with - the investors' own investors. It was also a bit of a treat for us to see our investors justifying their activities rather than us justifying ours, for once. The main body of the evening was spent with a presentation from the venture capitalists reviewing their investment year. This included a brief overview of each of the companies in the investment portfolio. It felt peculiar watching someone else, in this case the VC's representative on our board, give a presentation on our business. You could also tell from the tone of these presentations - whether the company was being talked up or whether expectations were being set somewhat lower - how positively the VC viewed the respective businesses. This was a key measure of perceived progress, particularly as a number of these business, including our own, were still in the euphemistically termed \"pre-revenue\" stage. There were also questions from the private investors. Among these, the general downturn in the value of internet stocks was the hottest topic. But a number of questions were addressed directly to representatives of the companies in attendance. We seemed to attract a disproportionate share. The most persistent questioning concerned the public relations risks of launching a product for teenagers - particularly one that dealt with online purchasing. The fear was that we could be accused of encouraging irresponsible spending. We needed to persuade the private investors - many of whom had teenage children - that we could deal with it. We had to start working for our wine and nibbles. The nature of the discussion that followed reinforced for us the level of sensitivity that exists around delivering products for teenagers. This was brought into even starker relief last week when internet chatrooms, another online service that is incredibly popular with teenagers, made headlines after a teenage girl who had befriended and then been assaulted by a paedophile she met in an online chat room. Chat rooms are inherently difficult to supervise. After all, anonymity and the ability to be someone else is a key part of the attraction for youngsters - you don't get conversations between DodgySheep and GlitterBabes in real life. We do not have a chat room at Rools, but our partners at Teenfront.com have just launched one. As a service for teenagers by teenagers they are simply responding to demand - for a long time now chat has been the service most requested by users in feedback that they have submitted via the Teenfront.com site. Teenfront.com tries to protect users of the chat room by displaying clear guidelines for use, employing watchers to monitor the rooms and by banning transgressors. It is relatively easy to do while they are small but is going to require tight management as they grow. Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools, an online payments service for teenagers.",

      "body": "<p>For the past nine years, said Daniel Barenboim, he had been doing a \"huge\" job in Berlin. As artistic director of the Staatsoper and its orchestra, the Staatskapelle, he has been responsible not just for the creative revival of the two institutions, but also for their day-to-day administration. Now, everything he has achieved is in danger of being erased. And Barenboim is incandescent with anger. </p> <p>It is not that he has lost his sense of humour. He often smiles and even tosses in the odd joke. But, as he makes his points, he leans towards you, sometimes holding you by the forearm, his eyes sparkling. \"Do you understand?\" he asks. And if you don't, then he's only too happy to go back and repeat his arguments till they are clear. </p> <p>The upshot of nine years' work hangs on persuading the rest of the world that he is right, and that the men and women who run the Berlin city council are wrong. Their scheme to merge the Staatsoper, in the east of the city, with the Deutsche Oper in the west, has become a cultural cause celebre. </p> <p>Like the fracture lines of a smashed mirror, its ramifications have darted in every direction, raising sensitive questions about the way the arts are funded in Germany, about how much culture a reunified Berlin can afford, about the authenticity of German reunification and even about whether Barenboim, an Argentinian-born Jew, is the victim of an anti-semitic plot. </p> <p>At heart, though, it is a simple issue of conservation. You realise that the moment you hear Barenboim's musicians play. \"The Staatskapelle has a very particular sound which, for want of a better term, is described as the German sound. It is a kind of sound that great German orchestras probably had before the war,\" he says. German music lovers call it sahnig (\"creamy\"). It arises mainly from the strings, but is enriched by the remarkable resonance and colour of the brass and winds. </p> <p>\"It is a sound that is based on a set of values that have gone slightly out of fashion today: the values of harmony, the values of legato, over the values of brilliance. In other words, it is a more spiritual and less athletic way of playing,\" says Barenboim. </p> <p>The Staatskapelle's unique sound is one of many things, good and bad, to have survived intact in the aspic of the former East Germany. Barenboim's decision to take over what was then a relatively obscure orchestra surprised many. He had long since been recognised as one of the world's pre-eminent musicians. He gave his first public performance at the age of seven, and went on to a glittering career, first as a pianist, then as a conductor, and finally as a creative supremo, starting in London on the South Bank in 1968. He was married to cellist Jacqueline Du Pre. </p> <p>Since arriving in Berlin in 1991, Barenboim has lifted the Staatskapelle into the top flight. Earlier this year, 50 critics polled by Opernwelt magazine voted it Orchestra of the Year. But he has taken care not to interfere with the singularity of that sound, which - he says - has a unique role to play in the unending debate over authenticity versus excellence. </p> <p>\"It is a very difficult question. What is it that makes Beethoven in some ways belong to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and why is his message contemporary today? Each great work of art has two faces in my opinion: one [facing] towards its time and one towards the future, towards eternity. Now, when you talk about its face towards eternity, how far do you go in modernising the instruments and using the means of expression that didn't exist then? This is a question which can only be answered individually. Some musicians have answered it by saying, 'We want to play the original instruments'; others have said 'No'.\" </p> <p>Gesturing towards the musicians of the Staatskapelle as they packed away their instruments, he said: \"These people have maintained a line that was developed, as it were, with the composers - don't forget this is the orchestra that played for years under the leadership of Richard Strauss - you can't say it's not valid any more today.\" </p> <p>Strauss was the musical director of the Staatsoper for a very long time: from 1898 to 1920. Creatively, the stakes in this row are high, which is why opponents of the council's plan tend to react - not with point-by-point refutation - but with bewildered outrage. It is rather as if environmentalists had learnt that China was intending to balance its budget by culling the remaining pandas. </p> <p>\"I think the idea that the Staatsoper could be made to disappear is so . . . so . . . so . . . disastrous \", splutters Barenboim, \"that the question should be asked the other way round: how much extra money do we need to keep this treasure?\" </p> <p>We are talking in an unlikely setting: the peeling, stained auditorium of the Tacheles art centre on Oranienburgerstrasse. It began life as a squat by artists from east and west Berlin after the fall of the Wall, and has evolved into one of the city's most vibrant cultural institutions. As a melting pot for eastern and western values, Tacheles has a history that is strikingly reminiscent of that of the Staatsoper since 1991. And, like the Staatsoper, it is threatened with death by financial cuts under the council's plan. So high culture Staatsoper and deeply alternative Tacheles had joined forces. The Staatskapelle musicians - the men in white tie; the women in black dresses - have just been giving a concert in Tacheles's ineffably trashed auditorium. </p> <p>The Berlin council, or Senat, which is heavily in the red, argues that the time has come to address the financial consequences of the cultural cold war. In their efforts to show that East or West was best, the authorities on either side of the Wall subsidised like crazy their respective orchestras, theatres, galleries and so on. The Senat has continued that tradition of generosity. Till now. </p> <p>But Barenboim says he can make no sense of the arguments put forward by the councillor responsible for culture. \"When he asked me whether I had a counter-proposal, my first question was: how much do you want, or do you need, to save? If you tell me you need to save 10 million marks, this is one thing. If you tell me you need to save 50 million marks, it is another thing. But he was unable to tell me how much money.\" </p> <p>Barenboim agrees that the legacy of cold war is central to the debate - but in a quite different way. \"The whole Berlin senate is the former West Berlin senate. The same people who were there in 1989 taking decisions for former West Berlin are now taking decisions for the whole of Berlin - and they cannot stomach what is happening in the east,\" he says. </p> <p>\"They are not going to destroy the building; they are going to destroy the people inside, close it for three or four years with the excuse that it has to be redone . . . then they will reopen it with great pomp in 2006 or 2007 as a western institution.\" </p> <p>In today's Germany, this is social Semtex. Since reunification 10 years ago, east Germans have seen their economy gutted and their politics sidelined. Westerners have taken over their universities, companies and bureaucracies. Now, one of the world's pre-eminent musical geniuses is telling them that one of their most valuable cultural assets is about to be raped by the westerners out of sheer spite. </p> <p>\"It's a takeover,\" insists Barenboim. \"We talk about German reunification. But in Berlin, it is not reunification: it's a takeover. It is the western economy that is rebuilding Potsdamer Platz. It is western money that has built the centre of Berlin. Reunification, in my understanding of the word, means to unite two things that belong together and were separated. But there is no reunification in Berlin.\" </p> <p>Those sort of remarks alone would ensure a venomous struggle over the future of opera in the city. But, amid a bout of national soul-searching over the neo-Nazi right, allegations have been made that the proposed merger also has undertones of anti-semitism. The man who used to be the councillor responsible for the arts in Berlin suggested as much in an article in the newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. </p> <p>On the question of anti-semitism, Barenboim, who has had a life-long love affair with German music and made an immense personal commitment to its future, is impossible to pin down. He denies and asserts within the same breath. Yet he addresses the issue in hugely emphatic language. \"I don't for one minute believe it is a general sentiment,\" he says. </p> <p>Then he adds: \"But they don't understand that there is a difference, even today, between being an anti-semite in Great Britain or the United States and to be one in Germany. I don't for one second believe that the German nation should be [asked to assume] collective guilt - certainly not so many generations afterwards. Absolutely not. </p> <p>\"But I do, by the same token, firmly believe that it is the responsibility of each German of any generation to make sure that the events of the 1940s do not repeat themselves. And therefore I think it is absolutely apt and necessary to expect greater sensitivity.\" </p> <p>Does he mean greater sensitivity than Germans had shown towards him during his stay among them? \"I haven't felt that personally,\" he replies. </p> <p>But then he adds: \"I know a lot of Germans - obviously, working in Germany for so long - and I feel many of them have not really worked out for themselves the problems of the Nazis and what the Nazis have left here . . . I believe that the Nazi time has to be seen as a dreadful time, but one part of German history and not the only part of German history. But they have not been able to work it out and therefore, as a reaction, said 'Let's not talk about it. Let's leave it aside', especially immediately after the war. So there are a lot of people in Germany still today who are ignorant about it.\" </p> <p>The remark which lay at the origin of the claims of anti-semitism was made by no less a figure than Klaus Landowsky, the leader of the Christian Democrat group on the city council. As he acknowledged, he said that the future of opera in the city lay between the conductor of the Deutsche Oper, whom he described in glowing terms, \"and the Jew Barenboim\". </p> <p>I put it to Barenboim that this is pretty raw stuff. </p> <p>The man concerned had apologised, he says. </p> <p>\"This chapter is closed.\"</p>",

Other countries, including Russia, are preparing to follow suit. Some French restaurants and butchers are refusing to sell beef on the bone.</p> <p>Many people now fear that eating beef could put them at risk of variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD), which is thought to come from the meat of cows that had BSE.</p> <p>So far this year no more than 80 cases of BSE have been diagnosed in France, including two new cases reported on Friday. Last year 31 cases were reported.</p> <p>Instead of reassuring consumers, the tightening of safety checks in June seems only to have increased public wariness after a series of recent food scandals ranging from infected duck liver pat\u00e9 to contaminated beef and lamb sausages.</p> <p>The reinforced monitoring is concentrated in Normandy. Whole herds are destroyed if one case of BSE is found.</p> <p>Public suspicion that the authorities might be concealing a wider outbreak was heightened last week when the Green movement, backed by President Jacques Chirac, demanded an immediate halt to sales of meat and bone meal from carcasses of cows for use as feed for poultry and pigs.</p> <p>It is still legal in France for these products to be used this way.</p> <p>Neither the publicly declared figures for BSE (expected to be no more than 100 animals this year), nor the two confirmed cases of vCJD are on the scale of the outbreak in Britain, where vCJD has killed 81 people since being identified by government scientists in late 1995.</p> <p>But there are fears that the numbers could rise sharply, in part because of better detection but also, because of reports of cheating by some cattle dealers and breeders trying to cover up the disease.</p> <p>The biggest shock was revealed a fortnight ago when some of France's most popular supermarket chains, led by Carrefour, admitted that a tonne of BSE-infected meat had been sold to customers after it got through the safety checks at an abattoir.</p> <p>This coincided with a government request to Afsa, the independent food safety agency, to study the possible dangers of beef on the bone, including T-bone steaks and a French favourite, cte de boeuf.</p> <p>Although under no obligation to react, the national steak restaurant chain Buffalo Grill withdrew the cuts from its menus this weekend and most butchers voluntarily followed suit.</p> <p>The mayors of 11 of Paris's 20 districts have banned beef entirely from school menus, a measure likely to be widely followed in the provinces.</p> <p>These actions prompted an urgent ministerial meeting as the weekend began, to try to calm public fears.</p> <p>The consumers' minister, Fran\u00e7ois Patriat, said there was no justification for an immediate withdrawal of bone meal while Afsa, which defied a EU ruling this year and outlawed the resumed import of British beef to France, said that a decision on bone meal would need at least four months' scientific study.</p> <p>Mr Chirac's spokesman said that even tighter monitoring was needed to stop BSE-infected cattle reaching abattoirs, but the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said France has already taken the most stringent precautions of any country to control BSE. And a BSE specialist, Jeanne Brug\u00e8re-Picoux, said she was astonished at the latest panic, \"at a time when it is obvious that the maximum exposure to risk is well behind us because of increased inspection\".</p> <p>Estimates of losses to farmers vary widely, but supermarkets say that beef sales are down 25-40% .</p> <p>The farmers' union FNSEA is about to launch a publicity counter-offensive. Its slogan will be a traditional expression of self-satisfaction: \"Je suis bien dans mon assiette,\" literally, I'm OK in my plate.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Schools all over France are expected to stop serving beef to children in their canteens, following the lead of many districts in Paris in responding to rising panic about the safety of French beef. Europe's biggest beef exporter now finds itself the object of international distrust in its billion-pound meat industry after leading the campaign to bar British beef from Europe because of the risk from animals with BSE, mad cow disease. A total ban on French beef has been imposed by Hungary. Other countries, including Russia, are preparing to follow suit. Some French restaurants and butchers are refusing to sell beef on the bone. Many people now fear that eating beef could put them at risk of variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD), which is thought to come from the meat of cows that had BSE. So far this year no more than 80 cases of BSE have been diagnosed in France, including two new cases reported on Friday. Last year 31 cases were reported. Instead of reassuring consumers, the tightening of safety checks in June seems only to have increased public wariness after a series of recent food scandals ranging from infected duck liver pat\u00e9 to contaminated beef and lamb sausages. The reinforced monitoring is concentrated in Normandy. Whole herds are destroyed if one case of BSE is found. Public suspicion that the authorities might be concealing a wider outbreak was heightened last week when the Green movement, backed by President Jacques Chirac, demanded an immediate halt to sales of meat and bone meal from carcasses of cows for use as feed for poultry and pigs. It is still legal in France for these products to be used this way. Neither the publicly declared figures for BSE (expected to be no more than 100 animals this year), nor the two confirmed cases of vCJD are on the scale of the outbreak in Britain, where vCJD has killed 81 people since being identified by government scientists in late 1995. But there are fears that the numbers could rise sharply, in part because of better detection but also, because of reports of cheating by some cattle dealers and breeders trying to cover up the disease. The biggest shock was revealed a fortnight ago when some of France's most popular supermarket chains, led by Carrefour, admitted that a tonne of BSE-infected meat had been sold to customers after it got through the safety checks at an abattoir. This coincided with a government request to Afsa, the independent food safety agency, to study the possible dangers of beef on the bone, including T-bone steaks and a French favourite, cte de boeuf. Although under no obligation to react, the national steak restaurant chain Buffalo Grill withdrew the cuts from its menus this weekend and most butchers voluntarily followed suit. The mayors of 11 of Paris's 20 districts have banned beef entirely from school menus, a measure likely to be widely followed in the provinces. These actions prompted an urgent ministerial meeting as the weekend began, to try to calm public fears. The consumers' minister, Fran\u00e7ois Patriat, said there was no justification for an immediate withdrawal of bone meal while Afsa, which defied a EU ruling this year and outlawed the resumed import of British beef to France, said that a decision on bone meal would need at least four months' scientific study. Mr Chirac's spokesman said that even tighter monitoring was needed to stop BSE-infected cattle reaching abattoirs, but the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said France has already taken the most stringent precautions of any country to control BSE. And a BSE specialist, Jeanne Brug\u00e8re-Picoux, said she was astonished at the latest panic, \"at a time when it is obvious that the maximum exposure to risk is well behind us because of increased inspection\". Estimates of losses to farmers vary widely, but supermarkets say that beef sales are down 25-40% . The farmers' union FNSEA is about to launch a publicity counter-offensive. Its slogan will be a traditional expression of self-satisfaction: \"Je suis bien dans mon assiette,\" literally, I'm OK in my plate.",

      "bodyText": "On the electronic monitor three dotted yellow lines plot the ebbing of a young girl's life. From Ghazala Jaradet, 13, whose body has sprouted plastic tubes, there comes only a small ghostly flutter of the left hand. Yesterday, with Ghazala's unseeing brown eyes staring out from her bandaged head, her mother gave her up for dead. A day after her eldest daughter was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier's rubber bullet, Maha Jaradet committed her to the past tense: another shahid (martyr) from more than five weeks of bloodshed. \"I am sure my daughter was assassinated,\" she said. \"She always talked about martyrs because she kept seeing them on TV.\" And so it went on, the weekend when the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, agreed to visit Washington for talks to try to end the fighting that has stolen more than 170 lives and left hundreds as critically injured as Ghazala. Mr Arafat is due to meet President Bill Clinton on Thursday, two days after the American voters elect a new leader. In the chill of her sitting room in the village of Beit Anoun, Mrs Jaradet does not want Mr Arafat to go. She is not sceptical of Mr Clinton's waning powers: after watching the doctors shake their heads over her daughter, who wanted to grow up to be a doctor, she is simply too angry for negotiations. \"It is much better to keep on fighting and to be a martyr then live in situation where you are humiliated,\" she said. Israeli officials say the prime minister, Ehud Barak, could also find his way to Washington within days of Mr Arafat, provided the fragile truce agreed at the end of last week takes hold. Ghazala may not live that long. Doctors at al-Ahlia hospital in Hebron say that the rubber bullet that ricocheted off the back of her head pushed a sharp fragment of bone deep into her brain, causing severe damage. If she survives she will be paralysed on the right side of her body. Such tragedies have become wearily familiar. Israeli soldiers killed two more Palestinians in Gaza yesterday, one a 16-year-old boy shot in the head. On Saturday it was Ghazala's turn. She was in a gaggle of girls in school uniform - green dresses and white headscarves - who walk home together every day. There were some boys stoning an Israeli patrol near the entrance to the village, but the girls went around it. \"Suddenly Ghazala said 'oh', and fell down,\" said Dima al-Motor, 14. A villager bundled the girl into his car and drove towards Hebron. It took two hours for Mrs Jaradet to follow her daughter to the intensive care unit - a distance of a few miles - because of Israeli concrete barricades blocking the main roads into Hebron. Palestinian and international human rights organisations have reported a disturbingly high incidence of head injuries from Israeli fire: about 70% of the 5,500 Palestinians injured were hurt in the upper body, including 26% shot in the head and neck. They accuse the Israelis of a shoot-to-kill policy against Palestinians. The army says it shoots only when soldiers' lives are endangered. A spokesman said last night that Ghazala was injured in a car crash and her family and doctors fabricated the story. Even if President Clinton can cajole Mr Barak and Mr Arafat into a bring about a lasting ceasefire and resuming negotiations for peace, the casualties of these weeks will continue to haunt hundreds of Palestinian families. \"She was my best friend, and when the Israelis shot her, I feel they took a part of my body,\" Dima al-Motor said.

You risk blessing and honouring the bones of a fat butcher.\"</p> <p>Two months ago a team led by Francesco Mallegni, a lecturer in human paleontology and anthropology at Pisa and Palermo universities, caused a minor sensation by rebuilding a face on the skull and identifying it as Giotto, who died in 1337.</p> <p>They claimed that the skull, unearthed 30 years ago but ignored art the time, showed a strong resemblance to Giotto's presumed self-portrait in the cycle of frescoes in the Scrovegni chapel in Padua.</p> <p>But Prof Toker, who worked in the cathedral between 1969 and 1974, said that coins found beside the body dated from long after Giotto's death.</p> <p>The team has also been misled by a description of the tomb by the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, because the cathedral had subsequently been altered.</p> <p>The skeleton's indications of an enthusiastic meat-eater suggested a butcher, not a well-off artist.</p> <p>The Italian team argued that the crooked nose, bull neck and deformed forehead matched the poet Petrarch's description of Giotto, and that high levels of aluminum, arsenic, zinc, lead - elements used in medieval painting - were found.</p> <p>It said that a contraction of the neck suggested much time looking upwards, presumably at frescoes; that the teeth had done a lot of chewing, presumably of paintbrushes; and that the left leg was injured, presumably from a fall from a ladder.</p> <p>Giotto di Bondone, who was born to a poor Tuscan family, paved the way for the Renaissance by abandoning the stylised rigidity of the middle ages in favour of perspective and naturalism.</p> <p>Cardinal Piovanelli, who proposed to perform the blessing on the anniversary of Giotto's death, remained silent yesterday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world has been fooled in hailing a skeleton unearthed in Florence Cathedral as that of Giotto, the father of European painting, it was claimed yesterday. Franklin Toker, who led excavations in the cathedral in the early 70s and is writing an archaeological history of Florence, derided the claim in an open letter to Cardinal Silvano Piovanelli, who plans a service in January to bless the remains. Dr Toker, professor of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh, said there was no reason to suggest that the skeleton of a short, squat man with an oversized head was that of the painter. \"For heaven's sake, your eminence, do not treat it as Giotto. You risk blessing and honouring the bones of a fat butcher.\" Two months ago a team led by Francesco Mallegni, a lecturer in human paleontology and anthropology at Pisa and Palermo universities, caused a minor sensation by rebuilding a face on the skull and identifying it as Giotto, who died in 1337. They claimed that the skull, unearthed 30 years ago but ignored art the time, showed a strong resemblance to Giotto's presumed self-portrait in the cycle of frescoes in the Scrovegni chapel in Padua. But Prof Toker, who worked in the cathedral between 1969 and 1974, said that coins found beside the body dated from long after Giotto's death. The team has also been misled by a description of the tomb by the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, because the cathedral had subsequently been altered. The skeleton's indications of an enthusiastic meat-eater suggested a butcher, not a well-off artist. The Italian team argued that the crooked nose, bull neck and deformed forehead matched the poet Petrarch's description of Giotto, and that high levels of aluminum, arsenic, zinc, lead - elements used in medieval painting - were found. It said that a contraction of the neck suggested much time looking upwards, presumably at frescoes; that the teeth had done a lot of chewing, presumably of paintbrushes; and that the left leg was injured, presumably from a fall from a ladder. Giotto di Bondone, who was born to a poor Tuscan family, paved the way for the Renaissance by abandoning the stylised rigidity of the middle ages in favour of perspective and naturalism. Cardinal Piovanelli, who proposed to perform the blessing on the anniversary of Giotto's death, remained silent yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "Charlize Theron in Two Days In The Valley (John Herzfeld, 1996) Who? South African-born former model. After making her debut in the Tarantino-esque Two Days In The Valley, Theron starred alongside Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate (1997), and almost managed to save it from total absurdity. But not quite. She fared a bit better as a nameless supermodel who is \"polymorphously perverse\" in Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) but blew it with a film that managed to make The Devil's Advocate look sophisticated - The Astronaut's Wife (1999). She played the wife of, you've got it, astronaut Johnny Depp, whose Southern accent is almost as bad as her acting. Since then, however, she's been in the Oscar-nominated Cider House Rules (1999) and has starred alongside James Caan, Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix in The Yards (2000), which is released this Friday. The role: Helga Svelgen, ex-ice skater and current lover of psychotic criminal Lee Woods (James Spader). Her finest moment is a stand-up brawl with Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher) in a sleazy motel room. Best line: When Lee jealously enquires about Helga's dalliance with a man they went on to kill, she tells him \"sometimes I really think you should have been born during the Spanish Inquisition\". Cringe factor: A bit of nudity and a skintight white catsuit are nothing to be ashamed of. Other wannabes: Michael Jai White plays Buck, and went on to star as superhero Spawn in the eponymous 1997 movie. Critical judgement: Barbara Shulgasser in the San Franciso Examiner called the film \"Short Cuts without the darkness\". Also not starring in: Children Of The Corn IV: The Gathering, in an uncredited role in 1996, and as Tina in Tom Hanks' That Thing You Do!, the same year.

The childcare arrangements of a separated couple function smoothly until one of them seeks to alter the roster for a trip with a new lover. </p> <p>But - as was demonstrated by the Dambuster-gonad scene after Adam's testicular cancer scare - the strength of Cold Feet is that it's willing to make the mirror a distorting one. Highly naturalistic acting - Fay Ripley's jumpy-funny Jenny and Robert Bathurst's status-crazed David and the rest all remind you of sometime you've known - is combined with the non-verit\u00e9 scenes of which the genital in the shopping centre is merely the best-remembered. </p> <p>In the new series, when estranged husband Pete looks round an emergency bachelor flat, there's a flashback to him and his then-fiance checking out what would become the family home. Speaking at the local residents' association to a largely empty hall, David has a sudden Blairite fantasy of balloons and tickertape and hero-acclaiming applause. Drama's weakness in comparison with the novel is the difficulty of dramatising inner thoughts. The usual solution is voiceover. Cold Feet's dream sequences are a far more satisfying way of entering the head of the characters. </p> <p>And, while a worsening problem in soap opera is the ease with which people live as if terrible recent events never happened, this drama plays fair with the back story of its cast. Some series would use cancer and abortion just as plot-bombs, but here these details from the past inform a storyline about the struggle to have children of two people who fear that, through choice and fate respectively, they have wasted their chance. </p> <p>While the characters in Cold Feet head for 40, the seventh episode in the rival young urban professional drama Attachments (Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2) hangs on a 30th birthday bash.

They have run a campaign of character assassination. Knowing that Al Gore has an intimidating grasp of the issues, they have used every trick, every dollar of special interest money, every toady in the press, to smear the vice-president as a liar. The cleverness of that diversionary tactic was that if it worked it would relieve GW of giving proper answers to the questions of substance he finds so bewildering.</p> <p>It worked.</p> <p>Now Bush is revealed as a liar on a serious issue of character. And what happens? The smear artists are shouting \"dirty politics\".</p> <p>Given the anti-Gore bias of the mainstream press, last Thursday night's revelation that Bush was arrested for drunken driving in 1976, when he was 30, may have come too late to affect his lead. The Republican spin machine has also been adept in damage control. Within 24 hours it had almost managed to turn the story into \"who leaked?\" instead of \"why didn't he come clean?' It is true the disclosure came from a Maine Democrat, though not from the Gore campaign. But the point is that it is true, and the real question is the character of the candidate who tried to conceal his past.</p> <p>He did confess to \"mistakes\" of his youth, but he would never be specific - hoping the \"mistakes\" would be thought of as youthful pranks, not serious crime. It is an offence to apply for any federal office without divulging an arrest record. Bush not only went to great lengths to cover up his conviction. He lied about it, too. In a 1998 interview, a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Bush point-blank if he had ever been arrested other than for a 1968 fraternity prank and Bush said flatly: \"No.\" The exchange was not reported at the time; it didn't seem newsworthy. And when Bush was called to jury service in a drunk-driving trial in Texas, he filled out the jury questionnaire, but left blank the yes-no entry asking if he had ever been accused in a civil or criminal case. Then he hastily got himself excused on the basis that he was the governor of the state.</p> <p>Imagine if this had been Al Gore! The Wall Street Journal, the most sedulous of the defamers, would have dispatched ferrets to find out what happened on the other form-filling occasions when \"the liar\" had to yield his record. Now the Journal, you bet, will be part of the great \"Smeargate\" diversion.</p> <p>Bush's handlers are saying, with some success, that his ready admission of the offence, when found out, is another sign of his probity. This sums up their entire campaign, one of breath-taking arrogance wrapped up in feel-good bromides. And they have got away with it.</p> <p>The basic misperception here is to confuse amiability with integrity, marketable charm with ability. The truth, bluntly, is that Bush is an irresponsible know-nothing. His instincts are those of the 1930s isolationist, little America, rather than the America that led the world in the creation of a new liberal world order. If he is president, say goodbye to the nuclear test ban, to action on global warming, to peacemaking interventions.</p> <p>Those of you in sodden Britain who might conclude that global warming, for instance, is a matter of concern should know that Bush, like the Wall Street Journal, regards it as a leftist scare. Asked what he would do, he responds that we need more study before ratifying the Kyoto agreement, putting me in mind of a fire chief who arrives at the blaze to say he will have to study the origins of the fire before trying to put it out.</p> <p>On social security, he has never throughout the entire campaign explained how he can take a trillion dollars and put it into personal accounts for mainly young workers without saying where the money will come from to secure the retirement payments for the rest of the ageing workforce. This weekend, attacking federalism, he did not even seem to realise that social security is a federal programme. Why hasn't the press blown the whistle? The economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times, a rare pundit who bothers to do the sums, writes: \"Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likeable would do that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>But he would. The drunken driving arrest is not the only character evidence from Bush's past that has been suppressed or glossed over. On October 2, the Center for Public Integrity in Washington and Bill Muntaglio and Nancy Beiles in Talk magazine revealed that Bush not once but repeatedly missed the legal deadlines for reporting his insider stock trades when he was a director and member of the audit committee of a ropey Texas oil company, Harken Energy. In 1991, three years before he ran for governor, the Wall Street Journal headlined one instance when Bush sold near the top of the market before the stock plunged, pocketing nearly $850,000. He was eight months late in reporting this coup. He claimed he had but that the SEC had \"lost the paperwork\". But neither the Journal, or anyone else, has asked Bush if the SEC \"lost the paperwork\" when he was derelict on three other newly-documented insider trades he did not report in the way required by the anti-corruption laws.</p> <p>The 1991 SEC investigation, criticised for being run by friends of then President Bush, ended inconclusively. Bush, it was said, could not have known of the magnitude of Harken's impending loss when he sold out. But the SEC never interviewed Bush and documents obtained last month under the Freedom of Information Act clearly show that Bush had more knowledge than he admitted. At least twice during the month he cashed out, he received memos showing the company was in financial peril.</p> <p>The man who claims the presidency on the grounds of probity has asserted: \"I believe in individual accountability and individual responsibility.\" But the credulous press and the cerebrally challenged television talk shows have been too busy pillorying Gore to ask Bush to reconcile rhetoric and action. \"I will do everything I can,\" he has said, \"to defend the power of private property and private property rights.\" But he has failed to reconcile that public testament with his enrichment from the seizure of private land for his Texas Rangers baseball stadium. Though then a private citizen, he contrived to use the power of the state to claim eminent domain over 270 acres - most of which was not needed for the stadium. Families who lost their land so that Bush and his partners could profit from the development potential are still mad at him for the land-grab and the ordeal of court hearings they had to initiate before getting a fair price. Maree Fanning, who lost the family horse farm, told a reporter: \"If I saw him today, I'd say 'Bite my ass'.\"</p> <p>Tomorrow too many American voters, deprived of the real story, may kiss it.</p> <p>Harold Evans is the author of The American Century</p>",

The aptly named Outrageous Art Gallery in Edinburgh claims to have used a worldwide network of forgers to produce exact copies of works displayed in the Scottish Colourists exhibition. The official exhibition at the national gallery features the work of the Edinburgh-born artists Samuel Peploe, John Duncan Fergusson, Francis Campbell Cadell and George Leslie Hunter, whose bold, colourful canvasses are much sought after by collectors. When the Outrageous Art Gallery heard that the Colourists' work was to move from the Royal Academy in London to Edinburgh, it set about acquiring identical fakes of the paintings.

Good luck to the undoubtedly talented beneficiaries of this \u00a320,000 architectural prize organised by the Royal Institute of British Architects, and bonne chance to next year's contenders. I don't want to sound curmudgeonly, but I don't get the Stirling prize and I'm not sure what good it does architecture. True, everyone likes a prize. Remember Alice in Wonderland, when the Dodo organised a caucus race for the animals? After they had run around in circles for a bit, the Dodo decided that \"everybody has won and all must have prizes\". Alice presented the animals with comfits from her pocket while she was awarded her own thimble. </p> <p>A good decision by that sensible Victorian girl and one that might apply to the arts and, notably, to architecture today. To get any half-decent building commissioned and completed in Britain is a small triumph, deserving of comfits, thimbles, acclaim, and even a cheque for \u00a320,000. But, as to how we judge one new building better than another when the contenders are so very different in form, spirit and function, I have no idea. Certainly those in this year's Stirling prize - named after the late Sir James Stirling (1926-92, architect of a fascinating awkwardness of radical buildings in Britain, the US and Germany) - are like the contents of a jamboree bag. </p> <p>Here's the calm, collected Walsall New Art Gallery by Caruso St John; Foster and Partners' cavernous Canary Wharf Station; and the London Eye by Marks Barfield. There's the diaphanous office block at 88 Wood Street, City of London, by the Richard Rogers Partnership; a deftly remodelled headquarters building in Berlin by Sauerbruch Hutton; and the jaunty Peckham Library. Finally, there's the \"people's choice\": Sainsbury's supermarket in Greenwich. </p> <p>Line these up along a very large imaginary catwalk. How would you rate them? Hard, isn't it? </p> <p>Dumb though the Miss World and Eurovision Song contests may be, it is easy enough for a panel of judges or a clapometer linked to the viewers at home to make a judgment based on the merits of fairly equal contenders. Now try judging the Stirling contenders the same way. It doesn't work. Each is built for a different purpose and to very different budgets. Each building offers a wholly different experience; they have been designed for longer or shorter lives. None should be judged by appearances alone. And here lies the rub. A PR-driven architecture prize can hardly be expected to concern itself with long-term concerns or values. The prize forces instant judgments, and generates instant fame and column inches (and I don't mean Ionic or Corinthian) for the winner. Care about a new Tube station, big wheel or municipal art gallery this year, forget about it the next. The same goes for the architects. </p> <p>A building takes time to mature. It needs to be used and experienced, to bed in to its surroundings, before it can be said to be anything like the best new building in Britain. It may face teething problems that make it a sitting target for the press in its early days. It might be berated for being late and expensive, as was Barry and Pugin's Palace of Westminster - but who cares now? It might be unpopular in its early years simply because it's unlike anything else that has gone before. Think of the Pompidou Centre (Piano and Rogers) or Lloyd's of London (Richard Rogers Partnership), two misfits when first built, the butt of many jokes, but now integral parts of Paris and London. Both cities would be poorer for their loss. </p> <p>There are many other considerations a judge of buildings might like to make. Given that you need to experience a new building in different weather and at different times of the year, does it work on a simple environmental level? Does the low winter sun come dazzling through its artistically arranged windows and make it difficult to work in? Does it get hot and bothersome inside, as so many modern buildings do? Is it likely to wear well? A building can go in and out of fashion as, say, the Gormenghast-like Midland Grand Hotel fronting St Pancras station has. A building isn't just for a season, it's for the life of, possibly, very many generations. </p> <p>What the Stirling prize does is put architecture into the \"new rock'n'roll\" camp, to nip and tuck it into the fashion world, to wash it on a tide of never-ending champagne, finger food and gossip into the groomed and polished clutches of the PR and marketing industry. Hardly a week seems to pass without yet another new prize being announced that promises to do for whatever field of creative endeavour \"what the Turner prize does for art\". </p> <p>Like a number of writers who love architecture, I have tried to promote it as best I can through the media, hoping to engage readers, listeners and viewers without resorting to the smoke-and-mirrors tricks of the PR industry. I want people to go and look at and experience buildings, old and new, and to learn how to make a judgment based on knowledge and experience, not on media sensation, peer group and PR pressure. </p> <p>I admit to feeling a pang of guilt: is this hungry-for-prizes world a monster of my own and my colleagues' making? We have long dreamed of making architecture a popular subject for discussion, but not an all-singing, all-dancing branch of showbiz. Showbiz is rightly contained by architecture (in theatres, concert halls, cinemas); architecture doesn't need to be caught in the sequinned embrace of showbiz. </p> <p>Prizes have a tendency to be sensational, transitory, feel-good-for-the-moment things that, like a dry martini, a cigarette or a line of cocaine, offer an instant boost to jaded systems. At least they might be linked to some charity or other and do something for a good cause; they rarely do. Some architectural awards do make sense, including the RIBA's own annual Royal Gold Medal for a lifetime's achievement or some unique and effective contribution to the world of architecture. Then there are awards for well restored or environmentally sound buildings and their architects; these are good because they recognise and encourage high standards in specific and measurable areas. Soon enough we won't be able to see the buildings for the awards and the surrounding facade of disingenuous hype. </p> <p>If the Stirling prize is to continue, and if its organisers want it to be more than the Brit awards for architecture, they need to ensure its role is serious without being worthy, that like is compared with like, and that any judgment is made on the true worth of a building and not just its instant appeal.</p>",

A report by the Commons home affairs committee into the search of Blantyre House, a resettlement prison boasting a reoffending rate of only 8%, is expected to be scathing. Martin Narey, the director-general of the prison service, who admitted that the raid in May failed to find the amount of contraband which had been suspected, finds his reputation in danger of being tarnished. It is claimed the controversy exposes a rift between those in the prison service who believe no risks should be taken with security and others who think a trust needs to be shown if inmates are to be reformed. The committee's inquiry heard how a team of 86 prison officers, 20 sniffer dogs and two control and restraint squads swooped on the prison near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. During Operation Swinford, doors were prised open and their frames smashed. More than \u00a35,000 of damage was done and when the squad left, the words, \"We woz 'ere\" were found chalked on a blackboard. All 120 inmates were drug-tested, although none proved positive. Alan Roger, a former inmate, said: \"The raid was brutal. It was a fishing expedition. An act of revenge. They want to destroy Blantyre House by stealth.\" A fortnight later Mr Narey told MPs that \"a quite frightening\" amount of contraband was found, including 25 bank cards, passports, driving licences in forged names, and equipment which could have been used in an escape. He also said \"large quantities of money\" were discovered. By the time Mr Narey testified again last month he accepted that the amounts of contraband had been small. An internal prison service document confirmed that the haul amounted to \u00a3370 in cash - of which \u00a3130 belonged to the chaplain - three unauthorised mobile phones, bank cards, cameras, building tools, seven pieces of pornography, a small amount of cannabis and three ecstasy tablets. The bank cards were mainly debit cards, which had been authorised by the governor and used by prisoners who went out to work. A lump hammer and spirit level also found were authorised work tools. There were combative exchanges between MPs and Mr Narey and his south-east area manager, Tom Murtagh. The all-party group of MPs was visibly outraged at the impact on this prison, one of only three \"resettlement\" jails in England and Wales. \"It was thoroughly unjustified and a ghastly mistake,\" complained the Tory MP, Humfrey Malins. All agree, including the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, who was told in advance about the raid, that trust between inmates and prison staff had been \"shattered\".

Slightly built, he is, by his own admission, obsessed with his own body. And other people's. In Hertford, Connecticut, he persuaded a taxi company to have its fleet painted the colour of flesh, on to which he transferred vinyl-adhesive body parts - nipples, belly buttons. \"The idea was to make the car look like the body of the driver with his shirt off,\" he explains. \"The drivers liked it because they thought they were going to get off with more women.

      "body": "<p>During 1979 songwriter, performer and artist Daniel Johnston discovered the two great loves that would shape his life. The first was the music of the Beatles, whose influence is apparent in his lyrics and music, the second was a young woman named Laurie. Sadly for the then 18-year-old Johnston, Laurie already had a fiance, a fact that provided him with enough material for over 50 songs. </p> <p>\"My story was really quite dismal,\" says Johnston, speaking of his teenage years. \"I'm a manic depressive and in junior high I had a nervous breakdown and I was really out of it. I discovered the Beatles and man, I was saved. I loved the music and everything about it. I started writing myself.\" The songs he began writing and recording were touching slices of emotion that detailed his rejection by Laurie and chronicled the downward trend in his mental health. His manic depression would lead to numerous hospital stays, which have seen him compared to \"outsiders\" such as Syd Barrett and even Van Gogh. </p> <p>Johnston first came to prominence in the early 1990s with a rash of releases on independent labels, of music he had taped on a cheap cassette recorder during the 1980s. Those who cut through the sound quality found a naive, honest beauty amid the shaky recordings which feature Johnston playing organ or singing in his high-pitched voice over jazz 78s. The songs dealt with his fragile mental state with frankness and a wry, self-deprecating humour. </p> <p>\"Daniel's appeal is obvious: he writes very catchy songs,\" says Irwin Chusid, author of Songs in the Key of Z, an exploration of outsider music which features a chapter on Johnston. \"He's done a lot of studio recording in the past 10 years, and in multi-tracked splendour, the strength of his songs is evident.\" </p> <p>During 1983 Johnston enjoyed his most productive period to date, recording over 100 songs in the garages of family members. But this creative explosion was a symptom of his illness spiralling out of control. His state of mind is neatly summed up in the lyric of Desperate Man Blues: \"I don't feel much like living. Can't see what for.\" The track comes from the tape he was recording as he finally suffered a breakdown. </p> <p>Rather than seek treatment Johnston hit the road, settling a few months later in the Texan capital, Austin. By 1985 he had become a minor celebrity there by handing out his tapes to strangers in the street, or at McDonald's where he was working. He even appeared on an MTV programme about Austin and won a local award for best songwriter. But by the time of his second MTV appearance in December 1986 he was in hospital under heavy medication. </p> <p>Johnston's breakdowns are part of his legend. There have been a litany of incidents, including the time he caused his father to crash-land a small aircraft he was piloting. Johnston became convinced that his father was Satan and tried to take the controls. Once again he was committed to a mental institution. </p> <p>The late 1980s and early 1990s were a particularly difficult time for him, even though he was starting to receive critical acclaim. A trip to New York to record in 1988 resulted in the album 1990, a bleak affair with none of Johnston's trademark humour. The main theme is Satan and Johnston's belief that \"the devil has Texas\". It was a breakdown set to music; some reviewers accused Johnston's label of exploiting his illness to sell records. </p> <p>The 1991 follow up, Artistic Vice, could not have been more different. Another stay in hospital was followed by an outpouring of upbeat material. He was backed for the first time by a full band, a bunch of misfits Johnston had met at a local church in West Virginia, where he was recuperating. Around this time he also recorded a tribute to his hero, John Lennon. </p> <p>Johnston's love for Lennon is nothing, however, compared to the flame he holds for Laurie. His hope that he will eventually be united with Laurie, in this world or the next, has never wavered and at the age of 38 Johnston is still writing about her. Half of the songs on his most recent album, Rejected Unknown, seem to be about her, his hopes of romance having been boosted by her recent divorce. His plan now is to make the big time, because this may enable him to win her heart. </p> <p>\"I started talking to her a little bit on the phone,\" he says. \"As she was no longer married I was very interested in talking to her. But it would be best if I waited until I was rich and famous, if I ever get to be rich and famous.\" </p> <p>Although it seems barely possible that one as awkward as Johnston would hit the big time, he has come close. In 1994 he released Fun on Atlantic records in the US. Their relationship ended after disagreements on working methods and a realisation that an ill Johnston was not easy to market. Johnston was also courted by Elektra but refused to work with them because of his belief that one of the label's other acts, Metallica, were in league with Satan. </p> <p>As the popularity of Johnston's music has blossomed so has appreciation of his childlike art work. He would previously hand out his felt-tip cartoons to friends and fans but has now come to see the value of his visual work and is regularly exhibiting it in the US. Simpsons creator Matt Groening purchased an armful of Johnston's drawings when the pair met. Ever the overgrown teenager, Johnston took the cheque, and Groening, straight to a comic shop. </p> <p>Johnston's drawings reflect the same themes as his music, namely love and rejection, dreams and nightmares, good and evil. They are inhabited by the same cast of cartoon characters who often appear in his songs. Fellow felt-tip artist Graham Dolphin, who is curating Johnston's first London exhibition, became a fan the first time he saw Johnston's art on his record sleeves. \"I liked the way that they were absolutely honest,\" he says. \"He makes totally sincere art.\" </p> <p>Whether Johnston is too sincere to make it big remains to be seen. His health is holding, aided by anti-depressants. His enthusiasm means that he will have plenty of people cheering him on and he doesn't mind too much whether they are laughing with him or at him, as long as they help him towards his goal of stardom, stadiums and getting the girl. \"I'm not really Jerry Lewis but I understand that I'm kind of humorous,\" he says. Fingers crossed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What? Me, accept the Order of the British Empire? Someone who does not believe in the monarchy that bestows it, let alone the erstwhile empire? As someone who routinely rails at America's democratic hypocrisy for insisting on a place on the dictatorial UN Security Council, can I really accept something from the hands of someone whose sole source of authority is a particular configuration of DNA?</p> <p>They gave it to me for \"humanitarian\" works, a polite euphemism for a couple of decades' work trying to thwart the US's efforts to execute thousands of its own citizens, and five of ours. Bashing the Americans does not seem much of a qualification for Her Majesty's gratitude (the Gentleman Usher to the Queen told us that was the proper way to address her). And there are many reasons to refuse it. But in the end, I accepted, although not without conceding several rounds in a long argument with my lefty friends.</p> <p>My friends were polite, and did not ask whether I deserve any such recognition. But first, they demanded, how could any right-thinking person possibly accept an OBE when this denotes an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, a title that combines pretension with colonial illusion.</p> <p>Certainly, I must agree that it should be changed to the Order of England (now that Scotland and Wales are thankfully free to go it alone). So, the name alone is a reason to reject it.</p> <p>Second, how could I even accept a \"gong\"? To this, at least I had some response. After years of firsthand observation, I recoil at the American predilection for expressing appreciation only with money. I have often wondered whether - casting aside the bizarre British tendency to bestow gongs disproportionately on those who are already privileged - it would not be better to have non-monetary tokens. Let us be done with the pretensions of chivalry, and make it more like a moral olympics, encouraging gold, silver and bronze medals for those who seek to foster decency in our society.</p> <p>Third, my friends said, how could I accept a token so inextricably entwined with British nationalism? Again, a valid point, but I must confess that the Americans have instilled in me an increasing appreciation for the country of my birth. I have spent 22 years in the belly of the beast, watching the excesses of the US as my clients have died in the electric chair. I now marvel at Britons who ogle across the Atlantic. Are they so blind that they do not see the future they covet? I have been held up at gunpoint five times in five years, a record unmatched by most London neighbourhoods. I'm not sure which I found more depressing: the prevalence of crime or the heart lessness it instils in the population at large.</p> <p>When I complained that my British client, Nicky Ingram, was not allowed to die with dignity in Georgia's electric chair, the Atlanta paper published a letter with just one word: Good. Truly, I have seen our future in America, and it does not work. Some of our well-known authors have recently flown off to New York to a bellow of criticism. Good luck to them. My years in the US have taught me to appreciate the better traits of the British.</p> <p>My friends did not raise the most troubling question of all: the Queen officially directs her subalterns to hang people in the Caribbean. In the name of Queen Elizabeth II, a warrant is issued \"to authorise and command you to carry the said sentence into execution by causing the said [human being] to suffer death . . . at some convenient place\" within the Caribbean prison system.</p> <p>Could I really accept an award, supposedly for my battle against executions, when others received a \"convenient\" hanging from the same hand? Since I was not born to be a prosecutor, I was unwilling to believe that the Queen, a human being severed from the reality of the world, personally savours a good hanging. I doubted that she even knew of her role. So, without wishing to be churlish, I resolved to test the point at the OBE-awarding ceremony.</p> <p>When she gave me the medal, this kindly old lady was probably nodding off after making brief small talk with a hundred momentary acquaintances. Amid so many others whose worthy acts took place far closer to home, she seemed confused when her equerry whispered some hint as to why I was there, having fought in faraway lands against the death penalty. When I thanked her, and suggested that I hoped one day to ensure that no executions should be carried out in her name or anyone else's, she simply nodded.</p> <p>The ephemeral audience in the gilded ballroom was over, and I can hardly pretend that we enjoyed a lengthy debate on the issue. Yet I very much doubt she knows that her officers give \"sufficient warrant\" to kill around her Commonwealth.</p> <p>But if the discussion had ended there, my friends would still have won the debate, and I could not have accepted this medal. What possible good could come of such self-aggrandisement?</p> <p>Ultimately, my reasons were two-fold. I have been discreetly informed that it was the Foreign Office that put my name forward for this award. In being kind enough to recognise a legal war of attrition against the Americans, my government has made a small, public condemnation of these executions. To be sure, I resent it when those in power fail to save the lives of my friends on death row, but it was John Major, not Tony Blair, who refused to ask the Americans to stop Nicky Ingram's death. In contrast, Robin Cook has expressed strong opposition to the death penalty worldwide.</p> <p>And then there is the question of the future. The government has taken a quiet moral stance. In the next few months, it will have plenty of occasions to put just a little of its moral authority where its mouth is. Kris Maharaj, formerly of Peckenham and now on Florida's death row, will shortly learn whether he gets a new trial. Jackie Elliott, born near me in Suffolk, waits lonely for death in George W Bush's Texan execution chamber. Scotsman Kenny Ritchie sits innocent beside Ohio's gurney. And then there is Tracy Housel, perhaps in the most dire danger, hovering only one appeal away from Georgia's electric chair.</p> <p>The OBE says nothing about me, but it does say that the government believes it to be in the interest of Britain that our citizens should not be executed. I did not ask for the honour, though it was a generous act to give it. But I will be asking the government for help with my British clients. And I expect it to act in the interests of Britons - and to help me prevent their execution.</p> <p>\u0095 Clive Stafford Smith runs a charity in New Orleans, Louisiana, dedicated to representing those without resources on death row, and Reprieve, a British charity committed to saving human life.</p>",

Bashing the Americans does not seem much of a qualification for Her Majesty's gratitude (the Gentleman Usher to the Queen told us that was the proper way to address her). And there are many reasons to refuse it. But in the end, I accepted, although not without conceding several rounds in a long argument with my lefty friends. My friends were polite, and did not ask whether I deserve any such recognition. But first, they demanded, how could any right-thinking person possibly accept an OBE when this denotes an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, a title that combines pretension with colonial illusion. Certainly, I must agree that it should be changed to the Order of England (now that Scotland and Wales are thankfully free to go it alone). So, the name alone is a reason to reject it. Second, how could I even accept a \"gong\"? To this, at least I had some response. After years of firsthand observation, I recoil at the American predilection for expressing appreciation only with money. I have often wondered whether - casting aside the bizarre British tendency to bestow gongs disproportionately on those who are already privileged - it would not be better to have non-monetary tokens. Let us be done with the pretensions of chivalry, and make it more like a moral olympics, encouraging gold, silver and bronze medals for those who seek to foster decency in our society. Third, my friends said, how could I accept a token so inextricably entwined with British nationalism? Again, a valid point, but I must confess that the Americans have instilled in me an increasing appreciation for the country of my birth. I have spent 22 years in the belly of the beast, watching the excesses of the US as my clients have died in the electric chair. I now marvel at Britons who ogle across the Atlantic. Are they so blind that they do not see the future they covet? I have been held up at gunpoint five times in five years, a record unmatched by most London neighbourhoods. I'm not sure which I found more depressing: the prevalence of crime or the heart lessness it instils in the population at large. When I complained that my British client, Nicky Ingram, was not allowed to die with dignity in Georgia's electric chair, the Atlanta paper published a letter with just one word: Good. Truly, I have seen our future in America, and it does not work. Some of our well-known authors have recently flown off to New York to a bellow of criticism. Good luck to them. My years in the US have taught me to appreciate the better traits of the British. My friends did not raise the most troubling question of all: the Queen officially directs her subalterns to hang people in the Caribbean. In the name of Queen Elizabeth II, a warrant is issued \"to authorise and command you to carry the said sentence into execution by causing the said [human being] to suffer death . . . at some convenient place\" within the Caribbean prison system. Could I really accept an award, supposedly for my battle against executions, when others received a \"convenient\" hanging from the same hand? Since I was not born to be a prosecutor, I was unwilling to believe that the Queen, a human being severed from the reality of the world, personally savours a good hanging. I doubted that she even knew of her role. So, without wishing to be churlish, I resolved to test the point at the OBE-awarding ceremony. When she gave me the medal, this kindly old lady was probably nodding off after making brief small talk with a hundred momentary acquaintances. Amid so many others whose worthy acts took place far closer to home, she seemed confused when her equerry whispered some hint as to why I was there, having fought in faraway lands against the death penalty. When I thanked her, and suggested that I hoped one day to ensure that no executions should be carried out in her name or anyone else's, she simply nodded. The ephemeral audience in the gilded ballroom was over, and I can hardly pretend that we enjoyed a lengthy debate on the issue. Yet I very much doubt she knows that her officers give \"sufficient warrant\" to kill around her Commonwealth. But if the discussion had ended there, my friends would still have won the debate, and I could not have accepted this medal. What possible good could come of such self-aggrandisement? Ultimately, my reasons were two-fold. I have been discreetly informed that it was the Foreign Office that put my name forward for this award. In being kind enough to recognise a legal war of attrition against the Americans, my government has made a small, public condemnation of these executions. To be sure, I resent it when those in power fail to save the lives of my friends on death row, but it was John Major, not Tony Blair, who refused to ask the Americans to stop Nicky Ingram's death. In contrast, Robin Cook has expressed strong opposition to the death penalty worldwide. And then there is the question of the future. The government has taken a quiet moral stance. In the next few months, it will have plenty of occasions to put just a little of its moral authority where its mouth is. Kris Maharaj, formerly of Peckenham and now on Florida's death row, will shortly learn whether he gets a new trial. Jackie Elliott, born near me in Suffolk, waits lonely for death in George W Bush's Texan execution chamber. Scotsman Kenny Ritchie sits innocent beside Ohio's gurney. And then there is Tracy Housel, perhaps in the most dire danger, hovering only one appeal away from Georgia's electric chair. The OBE says nothing about me, but it does say that the government believes it to be in the interest of Britain that our citizens should not be executed. I did not ask for the honour, though it was a generous act to give it. But I will be asking the government for help with my British clients. And I expect it to act in the interests of Britons - and to help me prevent their execution. \u0095 Clive Stafford Smith runs a charity in New Orleans, Louisiana, dedicated to representing those without resources on death row, and Reprieve, a British charity committed to saving human life.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Buried deep in the stack at the Bodleian library in Oxford, from which it is exhumed on average once every 50 years, lies a forgotten early 18th-century book which is both fascinating and disappointing by turns. A rare volume - and deservedly so - Memoirs of the 20th Century: Being Original Letters of State under George VI was the first ever complete work of futurology.</p> <p>Written around 1730 by a clergyman, Samuel Madden, it opens intriguingly enough, with a letter datelined Constantinople, Nov 3 1997, but sadly goes downhill from that point. Madden's 1997 is dominated by a George VI who is a mighty world emperor, but most of the book's 527 turgid pages are mired in contemporary, 18th-century concerns.</p> <p>A couple of ideas suggest, none the less, that Madden really was thinking systematically about the future. He envisages the establishment of public granaries in all villages - pretty radical stuff, really - and even some prototype women's rights legislation. Thirty years later, another, more ambitious forward-looking book appeared, The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925, became a bestseller, and futurology was on its way.</p> <p>This George was also a conquering hero, who tames the nations the anonymous author believed would be the miscreants of the early 20th century: France and Russia. The latter, 25,000 of whose troops sack Durham in a war of 1900, is seen as the world's second most powerful nation by this time, with America close behind. Not bad at all as predictions go.</p> <p>The book wasn't all politics, either. It foresaw the legacy of the canal-building boom, which had just begun, and extrapolated that by 1900, a network of waterways would form a superhighway system, with the effect that \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\". Substitute trains for barges and you are looking at a decent stab at what today's multinationals call trend forecasting.</p> <p>The Reign of George VI also envisages a king who hates modern architecture so much that he builds a new English capital city, called Stanley, in Rutland, which he fills with neo-classical buildings and surrounds by artificial mountains. Fanciful, perhaps, but strangely reminiscent of our own heir to the throne's ideal village, twee little Poundberry, in Dorset.</p> <p>Futurologists tend not to get a great press. No wonder Samuel Goldwyn was moved to observe, \"Never predict anything - especially the future\", and Arthur C Clarke, whose 2001 has in so many ways failed to materialise, to comment wryly that, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\"</p> <p>Yet it is arguable that we are far too harsh in smug retrospect on those who attempt to peer round chronological corners. Naturally, when we try to envision the future, we always get trivialities such as the fashions and shape of cars wrong. Those sorts of visual cues are decided on a whim rather than a response to need. But most futurological predictions I have come across are almost spookily prescient in more significant respects. Take this extraordinary forecast, made in 1661-70 years before Samuel Madden - in a scientific treatise by the philosopher Joseph Glanvill, a clergyman and chaplain to Charles II, and a founder member of the Royal Society. \"To them that come after us,\" Glanvill wrote, \"It may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly to the remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey; and to confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual in the future as by literary correspondence . . . I doubt not posterity will find many things that are now rumours verified into practical realities. It may be that, some ages hence, a voyage to the Southern tracts, yea possibly to the Moon, will not be more strange than one to America . . . the restoration of grey hairs to juvenility and the renewing of the exhausted marrow may at length be elicited without a miracle; and the turning of the now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be effected from late agriculture.\"</p> <p>By the late-Victorian era, futurology was becoming really quite slick. Jules Verne described, for example, how musical recitals would by 2000 be sent down a wire from the artist to pianos around the world. Well, MP3 music on the internet hasn't worked out quite like that, but it's hardly dissimilar.</p> <p>An American journalist, David Goodman Croly, writing in 1888 as Sir Oracle, predicted for the coming new century: \"Women throughout the world will enjoy increased opportunities and privileges. Along with this new freedom will come social tolerance of sexual conduct formerly condoned only in men. In addition, because of the greater availability of jobs, more women will choose not to have children.\"</p> <p>Twelve years later, another journalist, John Elfreth Watkins, having interviewed \"the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning\" on behalf of The Ladies' Home Journal made a brilliant series of consumer predictions. The future, Watkins reported, would witness air-conditioning, international telephones, colour photography, frozen meals, medicine taken through skin patches, snowmobiles, the tapping of energy from wind, tides and sunlight - and out-of-season fruit.</p> <p>Most amazing of all, perhaps, was Watkins's prophecy that, \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite end of circuits, thousands of miles at a span.\"</p> <p>John Maynard Keynes, also writing at the end of the 19th century, even prophesied e-commerce: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages.\" (Modern web shoppers will applaud Keynes's foresight, but regret that the \"delivery upon the doorstep\" part has yet to be sorted out.)</p> <p>Oddly enough, the would-be seers who consistently get the future wrong are specialists in their field, the media's beloved \"experts\", whose futurological track record isn't nearly as good as that of those whose approach is that of the generalist (aka, inspired guessing).</p> <p>The first expert futurologist was probably the Dorking vicar and demographer, Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 anonymously wrote a sensational pamphlet sounding the alarm on overpopulation. People had been complaining of overpopulation since Horace in 20BC, but Malthus was so convinced humanity would run out of space within a few years that he favoured effectively culling the working class, for which he was later derided by Karl Marx as \"a miserable parson\".</p> <p>Two hundred years on, Malthus still has his fans, and the fashion for apocalyptic forecasting grows apace. In 1964, a British physicist, John Fremlin, speculated in New Scientist on population trends for the coming 1,000 years, and argued that by the middle of the 29th century, 60,000 trillion people, a million times today's population, would spend their lives lying prone and eating recycled human bodies in cubicles in 2,000 storey buildings spread across both land and what had been sea.</p> <p>The apocalyptic certainty of choice today, of course, is global warming, which if its advocates are right, would be the profoundest ever future prediction. It is worth noting, however, that just a couple of decades ago, many of the same experts were confidently predicting global cooling , and a new ice age. \"A new ice age must now stand alongside a nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale misery and death,\" said International Wildlife magazine in 1975. The next year, Science magazine reported that we were \"heading for extensive northern hemisphere glaciation.\"</p> <p>Even experts proferring non-apocalyptic futurology have been hugely and entertainingly wrong over the years. The Nobel prize winning physicist, Ernest Rutherford, the founder of nuclear physics, once declared that talk of nuclear power was \"moonshine\". Britain's astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\" in 1957 - a fortnight before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1.</p> <p>And then there was Thomas J Watson, the former CEO of IBM, who never quite lived down a statement he made in the late 1940s: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" (Perhaps he really meant five computers per household.) No wonder that, in another of his dictums, Arthur C Clarke said that \"when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right, but when he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\"</p> <p>So what predictions for the next century would I make, having interviewed dozens of both expert and generalist futurologists, and explored the pitfalls and triumphs of past futurology? Well, I can't see the old favourite, household robots, ever taking off - another massive instruction book to read, another machine to drive us mad with software seizures.</p> <p>It is hard, similarly, to see artificial, computer intelligence being much of a starter, although it's promised for as early as 2015. Even if it could be achieved (which human brain experts are very sceptical of, pointing out that our most powerful computer currently has the intellect of an earthworm) there would, surely, be no market for computers which, when given a boring job, told you to do it your damned self.</p> <p>We like computers, surely, for their artificial stupidity . And if they get too clever, won't they soon start complaining of cruelty? (You laugh, but cruelty to computers is said to be close to becoming a social issue, and is already being discussed by acade mics specialising in human rights.)</p> <p>Genetic engineering will, I strongly suspect, also fail to deliver a fraction of what its advocates promise. There will be endless cases reported in the press around 2025 of people who supposedly had the \"criminal gene\" edited out of their DNA, and subsequently been convicted of car theft. Likewise, parents who paid to have the \"gay gene\" excised (probably illegally) from their children's make-up and ended up disappointed by the result will be locked in litigation with the clinics who did the genetic work.</p> <p>Time travel, I can't see happening either. It took the great Stephen Hawking to point out the obvious objection - that if it were possible, surely we would have seen tourists from the future by now? Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek is said to be a possibility, however. But whether a teleported human will arrive at his destination complete with his mind and memory intact will be an interesting one to watch.</p> <p>Medical advances, meanwhile, may well soon make death a lifestyle option rather than an inevitability, and this could have extraordinary repercussions. If you take the view, for example, that religion has only existed for the past few thousand years because of our fear of death, could the prospect of eternal life finally destroy religion once and for all? And could that, in turn, lead to an overwhelmingly amoral society?</p> <p>Space travel - and the eventual colonisation of other planets is probably inevitable if we all live for hundreds of years - may throw up some interesting conundrums too.

      "bodyText": "Buried deep in the stack at the Bodleian library in Oxford, from which it is exhumed on average once every 50 years, lies a forgotten early 18th-century book which is both fascinating and disappointing by turns. A rare volume - and deservedly so - Memoirs of the 20th Century: Being Original Letters of State under George VI was the first ever complete work of futurology. Written around 1730 by a clergyman, Samuel Madden, it opens intriguingly enough, with a letter datelined Constantinople, Nov 3 1997, but sadly goes downhill from that point. Madden's 1997 is dominated by a George VI who is a mighty world emperor, but most of the book's 527 turgid pages are mired in contemporary, 18th-century concerns. A couple of ideas suggest, none the less, that Madden really was thinking systematically about the future. He envisages the establishment of public granaries in all villages - pretty radical stuff, really - and even some prototype women's rights legislation. Thirty years later, another, more ambitious forward-looking book appeared, The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925, became a bestseller, and futurology was on its way. This George was also a conquering hero, who tames the nations the anonymous author believed would be the miscreants of the early 20th century: France and Russia. The latter, 25,000 of whose troops sack Durham in a war of 1900, is seen as the world's second most powerful nation by this time, with America close behind. Not bad at all as predictions go. The book wasn't all politics, either. It foresaw the legacy of the canal-building boom, which had just begun, and extrapolated that by 1900, a network of waterways would form a superhighway system, with the effect that \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\". Substitute trains for barges and you are looking at a decent stab at what today's multinationals call trend forecasting. The Reign of George VI also envisages a king who hates modern architecture so much that he builds a new English capital city, called Stanley, in Rutland, which he fills with neo-classical buildings and surrounds by artificial mountains. Fanciful, perhaps, but strangely reminiscent of our own heir to the throne's ideal village, twee little Poundberry, in Dorset. Futurologists tend not to get a great press. No wonder Samuel Goldwyn was moved to observe, \"Never predict anything - especially the future\", and Arthur C Clarke, whose 2001 has in so many ways failed to materialise, to comment wryly that, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\" Yet it is arguable that we are far too harsh in smug retrospect on those who attempt to peer round chronological corners. Naturally, when we try to envision the future, we always get trivialities such as the fashions and shape of cars wrong. Those sorts of visual cues are decided on a whim rather than a response to need. But most futurological predictions I have come across are almost spookily prescient in more significant respects. Take this extraordinary forecast, made in 1661-70 years before Samuel Madden - in a scientific treatise by the philosopher Joseph Glanvill, a clergyman and chaplain to Charles II, and a founder member of the Royal Society. \"To them that come after us,\" Glanvill wrote, \"It may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly to the remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey; and to confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual in the future as by literary correspondence . . . I doubt not posterity will find many things that are now rumours verified into practical realities. It may be that, some ages hence, a voyage to the Southern tracts, yea possibly to the Moon, will not be more strange than one to America . . . the restoration of grey hairs to juvenility and the renewing of the exhausted marrow may at length be elicited without a miracle; and the turning of the now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be effected from late agriculture.\" By the late-Victorian era, futurology was becoming really quite slick. Jules Verne described, for example, how musical recitals would by 2000 be sent down a wire from the artist to pianos around the world. Well, MP3 music on the internet hasn't worked out quite like that, but it's hardly dissimilar. An American journalist, David Goodman Croly, writing in 1888 as Sir Oracle, predicted for the coming new century: \"Women throughout the world will enjoy increased opportunities and privileges. Along with this new freedom will come social tolerance of sexual conduct formerly condoned only in men. In addition, because of the greater availability of jobs, more women will choose not to have children.\" Twelve years later, another journalist, John Elfreth Watkins, having interviewed \"the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning\" on behalf of The Ladies' Home Journal made a brilliant series of consumer predictions. The future, Watkins reported, would witness air-conditioning, international telephones, colour photography, frozen meals, medicine taken through skin patches, snowmobiles, the tapping of energy from wind, tides and sunlight - and out-of-season fruit. Most amazing of all, perhaps, was Watkins's prophecy that, \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite end of circuits, thousands of miles at a span.\" John Maynard Keynes, also writing at the end of the 19th century, even prophesied e-commerce: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages.\" (Modern web shoppers will applaud Keynes's foresight, but regret that the \"delivery upon the doorstep\" part has yet to be sorted out.) Oddly enough, the would-be seers who consistently get the future wrong are specialists in their field, the media's beloved \"experts\", whose futurological track record isn't nearly as good as that of those whose approach is that of the generalist (aka, inspired guessing). The first expert futurologist was probably the Dorking vicar and demographer, Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 anonymously wrote a sensational pamphlet sounding the alarm on overpopulation. People had been complaining of overpopulation since Horace in 20BC, but Malthus was so convinced humanity would run out of space within a few years that he favoured effectively culling the working class, for which he was later derided by Karl Marx as \"a miserable parson\". Two hundred years on, Malthus still has his fans, and the fashion for apocalyptic forecasting grows apace. In 1964, a British physicist, John Fremlin, speculated in New Scientist on population trends for the coming 1,000 years, and argued that by the middle of the 29th century, 60,000 trillion people, a million times today's population, would spend their lives lying prone and eating recycled human bodies in cubicles in 2,000 storey buildings spread across both land and what had been sea. The apocalyptic certainty of choice today, of course, is global warming, which if its advocates are right, would be the profoundest ever future prediction. It is worth noting, however, that just a couple of decades ago, many of the same experts were confidently predicting global cooling , and a new ice age. \"A new ice age must now stand alongside a nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale misery and death,\" said International Wildlife magazine in 1975. The next year, Science magazine reported that we were \"heading for extensive northern hemisphere glaciation.\" Even experts proferring non-apocalyptic futurology have been hugely and entertainingly wrong over the years. The Nobel prize winning physicist, Ernest Rutherford, the founder of nuclear physics, once declared that talk of nuclear power was \"moonshine\". Britain's astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\" in 1957 - a fortnight before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. And then there was Thomas J Watson, the former CEO of IBM, who never quite lived down a statement he made in the late 1940s: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" (Perhaps he really meant five computers per household.) No wonder that, in another of his dictums, Arthur C Clarke said that \"when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right, but when he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\" So what predictions for the next century would I make, having interviewed dozens of both expert and generalist futurologists, and explored the pitfalls and triumphs of past futurology? Well, I can't see the old favourite, household robots, ever taking off - another massive instruction book to read, another machine to drive us mad with software seizures. It is hard, similarly, to see artificial, computer intelligence being much of a starter, although it's promised for as early as 2015. Even if it could be achieved (which human brain experts are very sceptical of, pointing out that our most powerful computer currently has the intellect of an earthworm) there would, surely, be no market for computers which, when given a boring job, told you to do it your damned self. We like computers, surely, for their artificial stupidity . And if they get too clever, won't they soon start complaining of cruelty? (You laugh, but cruelty to computers is said to be close to becoming a social issue, and is already being discussed by acade mics specialising in human rights.) Genetic engineering will, I strongly suspect, also fail to deliver a fraction of what its advocates promise. There will be endless cases reported in the press around 2025 of people who supposedly had the \"criminal gene\" edited out of their DNA, and subsequently been convicted of car theft. Likewise, parents who paid to have the \"gay gene\" excised (probably illegally) from their children's make-up and ended up disappointed by the result will be locked in litigation with the clinics who did the genetic work. Time travel, I can't see happening either. It took the great Stephen Hawking to point out the obvious objection - that if it were possible, surely we would have seen tourists from the future by now? Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek is said to be a possibility, however. But whether a teleported human will arrive at his destination complete with his mind and memory intact will be an interesting one to watch. Medical advances, meanwhile, may well soon make death a lifestyle option rather than an inevitability, and this could have extraordinary repercussions. If you take the view, for example, that religion has only existed for the past few thousand years because of our fear of death, could the prospect of eternal life finally destroy religion once and for all? And could that, in turn, lead to an overwhelmingly amoral society? Space travel - and the eventual colonisation of other planets is probably inevitable if we all live for hundreds of years - may throw up some interesting conundrums too. For what will be tax position of the colonists? The first generation living on another planet may feel allegiance to the country that paid for their trip and the building of their base. But thereafter, it seems probable that Mars-born humans who only know Earth as a dot in the night sky, might resist attempts to tax them. Maybe there will be a space repeat of the 1773 Boston tea party? One thing is certain for the future. Just as we fervently believe we are living in a special time, and are a special generation witnessing a huge turning point in human affairs - so will our grandchildren and their grandchildren.

      "body": "<p>Arriving at Kabul airport for a 6am flight to Herat, in the north-west of Afghanistan, it soon became clear that this was going to be no ordinary journey. For a start, only one other passenger was waiting in the gloom. Everyone else was at the mosque. They were right to pray. If British Airways is the world's favourite airline, then Ariana Airways - Afghanistan's national carrier - is the world's most dangerous. Since America imposed sanctions on Afghanistan a year ago, none of its planes has been serviced.</p> <p>Two years ago an Ariana 727 ploughed into a mountainside, reducing the fleet to three. Then in February, an internal flight to Mazar-i-Sharif was hijacked. The plane ended up at Stansted airport, where most of the passengers promptly claimed asylum. Seeking to calm my nerves, I had asked a pilot the night before departure how safe the remaining two Russian-built Antonov 24 planes were. \"Completely unsafe,\" he replied. \"The pilots are themselves too scared to fly. If I were you I'd throw your ticket in the bin.\"</p> <p>Gradually more passengers emerged into the chilly Kabul morning from yellow and black taxis. Four wraith-like women dressed in faded blue burkas moved among them, begging. Though it has been four years since the Taliban swept into Kabul, Ariana is still issuing the same pre-revolutionary tickets. They carry a picture of Afghanistan's most famous tourist attraction - a giant Buddha statue - on the back. Or at least they did - someone in a back office spends all day scrubbing out the Buddha's face with a black pen.</p> <p>There is no x-ray machine at Kabul airport, which perhaps explains last February's hijack. Instead, a security guard rummages briefly through your luggage. After half an hour we trooped on to the mortar-damaged runway, and climbed aboard. The six burka-clad women on the flight all sat together at the back. And then the engines started - not with the spluttering I had expected but with a confident purr. The plane even took off, rising into the mountains above a shattered city of bombed out houses.</p> <p>I started chatting to Abdul Hakim as we passed over the immense Hindu Kush mountains. Mr Hakim, it transpired, had been Afghanistan's minister for the interior until the Russians invaded in 1979, when he lost his job. He was also friends with Mohammad Daoud, the prime minister, who was murdered in a communist coup. \"The 70s was a marvellous period for Afghanistan. Lots of tourists came here.\" I asked him what he thought of the Taliban. His face fell. \"They have brought peace,\" he said. Mrs Hakim sat silently. With her face still concealed, she discreetly lifted her burka to peer out of the window.</p> <p>About halfway through our two-hour flight, a man carrying a Kalashnikov sauntered down the aisle. He was clearly not the Ariana steward, busy doling out Iranian cherry juice and cake. Sensing my alarm, Mr Hakim explained that since the hijack the Taliban had decreed that two armed guards should travel with every Ariana plane to prevent further mischief. Below us, the undulating Hindu Kush was giving way to a flat, dry landscape. We were nearly at Herat. The wheels popped down. Things were looking up. One of the two tyres on my side of the plane even had tread on it.</p> <p>Herat was the capital of medieval Islam. The city has long been famed for its learning and liberal traditions. All this changed when the Taliban arrived in 1995, closing down the girls' schools and the public baths. But Herat is still a long way from Kabul. Five years on there are signs that its inhabitants are making their own accommodation with the Taliban's edicts. You can secretly buy TV sets here. During the World Cup, rumour has it that five Taliban knocked on the door of someone who had one - not to smash it up, but because they wanted to watch the football.</p>",

If British Airways is the world's favourite airline, then Ariana Airways - Afghanistan's national carrier - is the world's most dangerous. Since America imposed sanctions on Afghanistan a year ago, none of its planes has been serviced. Two years ago an Ariana 727 ploughed into a mountainside, reducing the fleet to three. Then in February, an internal flight to Mazar-i-Sharif was hijacked. The plane ended up at Stansted airport, where most of the passengers promptly claimed asylum. Seeking to calm my nerves, I had asked a pilot the night before departure how safe the remaining two Russian-built Antonov 24 planes were. \"Completely unsafe,\" he replied. \"The pilots are themselves too scared to fly. If I were you I'd throw your ticket in the bin.\" Gradually more passengers emerged into the chilly Kabul morning from yellow and black taxis. Four wraith-like women dressed in faded blue burkas moved among them, begging. Though it has been four years since the Taliban swept into Kabul, Ariana is still issuing the same pre-revolutionary tickets. They carry a picture of Afghanistan's most famous tourist attraction - a giant Buddha statue - on the back. Or at least they did - someone in a back office spends all day scrubbing out the Buddha's face with a black pen. There is no x-ray machine at Kabul airport, which perhaps explains last February's hijack. Instead, a security guard rummages briefly through your luggage. After half an hour we trooped on to the mortar-damaged runway, and climbed aboard. The six burka-clad women on the flight all sat together at the back. And then the engines started - not with the spluttering I had expected but with a confident purr. The plane even took off, rising into the mountains above a shattered city of bombed out houses. I started chatting to Abdul Hakim as we passed over the immense Hindu Kush mountains. Mr Hakim, it transpired, had been Afghanistan's minister for the interior until the Russians invaded in 1979, when he lost his job. He was also friends with Mohammad Daoud, the prime minister, who was murdered in a communist coup. \"The 70s was a marvellous period for Afghanistan. Lots of tourists came here.\" I asked him what he thought of the Taliban. His face fell. \"They have brought peace,\" he said. Mrs Hakim sat silently. With her face still concealed, she discreetly lifted her burka to peer out of the window. About halfway through our two-hour flight, a man carrying a Kalashnikov sauntered down the aisle. He was clearly not the Ariana steward, busy doling out Iranian cherry juice and cake. Sensing my alarm, Mr Hakim explained that since the hijack the Taliban had decreed that two armed guards should travel with every Ariana plane to prevent further mischief. Below us, the undulating Hindu Kush was giving way to a flat, dry landscape. We were nearly at Herat. The wheels popped down. Things were looking up. One of the two tyres on my side of the plane even had tread on it. Herat was the capital of medieval Islam. The city has long been famed for its learning and liberal traditions. All this changed when the Taliban arrived in 1995, closing down the girls' schools and the public baths. But Herat is still a long way from Kabul. Five years on there are signs that its inhabitants are making their own accommodation with the Taliban's edicts. You can secretly buy TV sets here. During the World Cup, rumour has it that five Taliban knocked on the door of someone who had one - not to smash it up, but because they wanted to watch the football.",

      "body": "<p>If this is Sunday, it must be Philadelphia. Or Michigan. Or Iowa. His eyes almost closed from exhaustion, his voice sometimes cracking and his trademark plea of \"I need your help\" sounding more and more heart-felt, Al Gore is squeezing every last moment from the day and the night as he swings one last time through the states that could go either way.</p> <p>It falls to the Rev Albert Campbell, pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist church in the black area of West Philadelphia, to make the early morning introduction of the vice-president after invoking an even higher authority.</p> <p>\"Work your will, Lord, this election time,\" Mr Campbell implores as he stands before one of the city's finest gospel choirs, \"because what we do, dear God, has impact on all the world\".</p> <p>Al Gore, looking just like a man who has had to exist on between two and five hours' sleep a night and big doses of coffee and political adrenaline, takes up the religious theme in the packed church by telling the congregation that \"the day and is drawing nigh, the one day every four years when the people have the power\". He reminds them of the words of St Paul to the Galatians: \"Be not weary in well doing.\"</p> <p>Weary in every other respect, the Democratic party's presidential candidate has subjected himself to this desperately punishing schedule buoyed by a late feeling in his team that victory is still within his grasp if he can but claim the \"toss-up states\".</p> <p>Nowhere is closer than Pennsylvania, where the latest local opinion survey shows Mr Gore at 43% compared to 42% for his Republican opponent, George W Bush, and 8% for the Green party standard-bearer, Ralph Nader.</p> <p>With its 23 votes in the electoral college - the body reflecting the popular vote in each state which then elects the president - Pennsylvania could even swing the result. That is why its biggest city is playing host this Sunday to three Gorerallies.</p> <p>This last weekend started in Aimes, Iowa, on Friday. By the time Air Force II touched down in the early evening drought-breaking rain at Memphis airport that night, Mr Gore had already delivered his standard speech in three states. The visit to his home state of Tennessee should not have been necessary, but the polls have put Mr Bush just ahead there.</p> <p>The vice-president has become more expansive with the travelling press since the summer, but his message now is very much over the heads of the media and towards the great undecided.</p> <p>The crowd of around 2,000 in Court Square in downtown Memphis has been serenaded by no less then the Rev Al Green, Preston Shannon and Ruby Wilson, the cream of soul and rhythm and blues here.</p> <p>Wilson refers to Al Gore as our \"homeboy\" although homeboy may not be the first - or even the 101st - description that springs to mind when the vice-president bounds on stage with his wife Tipper and his daughter Kristin, a comedy script writer in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Memphis is a predominantly black town and that is reflected in the crowd. The rally has been arranged at speed - campaign headquarters in every swing state have been put on alert for a visit.</p> <p>The Team Tennessee youngsters working for Mr Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman have to make sure that the placards - tonight they say \"Tipper Rocks\", whatever that means - are handed out to willing hands to wave when the camera lights hit them.</p> <p>Mr Gore's voice has started to go - it cracks a couple of times during a speech delivered jacketless despite the damp. He finishes with the standard: \"I may not be the most exciting politician in the world - like Willie Herenton [the dashing local mayor] - but I will work for you each day and I will fight for you with all my heart.\"</p> <p>The Gore team is deliberately making no comment on the drink-driving story that has emerged from Mr Bush's distant past, but privately there is much glee, not least because of the Bush TV commercial beaming out in Tennessee tonight, which has him saying: \"I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their own actions.\"</p> <p>There's not much sleep in these final hours. Mr Gore will get between the sheets too late even to see Madonna endorsing him on Dave Letterman's Late Show: \"I'm a chick so who [else] would I vote for?\"</p> <p>Grey dawn Saturday, and a prayer meeting at the Peabody Hotel, Memphis. Then the motorcade takes Mr Gore out of his home state, his campaign here possibly concluded. He may not returns until he casts his vote in Carthage tomorrow.</p> <p>The motorcade blue-lights its way to the airport for a flight to Huntington, West Virginia. Here a small rally has supporters arranged strategically behind the vice-president nodding and smiling like loyal bankbenchers during televised question time in the House of Commons.</p> <p>Then there is the private trip to watch Al Junior playing football for his high school team in Washington, and finally on to chilly Pittsburgh. \"It ain't really cold, it just acts that way,\" the bearded airport employee tells the shivering arrivals. \"You've all been down in the South too long.\"</p> <p>The Wesley Centre African Methodist Episcopalian Zion church is the first stop here and has honoured Mr Gore with another stellar gospel choir singing Blessed Lord and O Happy Day as he arrives almost dead on time.</p> <p>If this race was decided on who has the best musical accompaniment Mr Gore would win by a landslide. Mr Bush's best shot so far seems to have been Hank Williams Jr: those heirs to famous names must stick together.</p> <p>The clear strategy in these last few days is no longer just to deliver the message, for everyone in these churches is converted, but to get people to persuade everyone they know to vote. Mr Gore presses the buttons again: affirmative action, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, the tragedy of Africa's Tutsis and the Hutus, the need for hate-crime legislation, his boyhood horror at seeing rings for tying up slaves in a mansion on the hill in Carthage, the threat to civil rights if Mr Bush is elected and appoints conservative judges to the supreme court.</p> <p>The last rally of Saturday is with another solid Democratic sector, the unions. They have organised a bash in Pittsburgh's Hot Metal Street. Here the audience is much whiter, big men from this old steel city in baseball caps and jackets, promising to get out the vote on the day.</p> <p>This is not so much a marathon as a steeplechase, vaulting the time and weather zones and plunging through the cold water of public scepticism. The finishing post is in sight. But first it's off to Fairmount park in the heart of the city of Brotherly Love on this glorious autumn day.</p> <p>On the whole, WC Fields said in his famous epitaph, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

      "bodyText": "If this is Sunday, it must be Philadelphia. Or Michigan. Or Iowa. His eyes almost closed from exhaustion, his voice sometimes cracking and his trademark plea of \"I need your help\" sounding more and more heart-felt, Al Gore is squeezing every last moment from the day and the night as he swings one last time through the states that could go either way. It falls to the Rev Albert Campbell, pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist church in the black area of West Philadelphia, to make the early morning introduction of the vice-president after invoking an even higher authority. \"Work your will, Lord, this election time,\" Mr Campbell implores as he stands before one of the city's finest gospel choirs, \"because what we do, dear God, has impact on all the world\". Al Gore, looking just like a man who has had to exist on between two and five hours' sleep a night and big doses of coffee and political adrenaline, takes up the religious theme in the packed church by telling the congregation that \"the day and is drawing nigh, the one day every four years when the people have the power\". He reminds them of the words of St Paul to the Galatians: \"Be not weary in well doing.\" Weary in every other respect, the Democratic party's presidential candidate has subjected himself to this desperately punishing schedule buoyed by a late feeling in his team that victory is still within his grasp if he can but claim the \"toss-up states\". Nowhere is closer than Pennsylvania, where the latest local opinion survey shows Mr Gore at 43% compared to 42% for his Republican opponent, George W Bush, and 8% for the Green party standard-bearer, Ralph Nader. With its 23 votes in the electoral college - the body reflecting the popular vote in each state which then elects the president - Pennsylvania could even swing the result. That is why its biggest city is playing host this Sunday to three Gorerallies. This last weekend started in Aimes, Iowa, on Friday. By the time Air Force II touched down in the early evening drought-breaking rain at Memphis airport that night, Mr Gore had already delivered his standard speech in three states. The visit to his home state of Tennessee should not have been necessary, but the polls have put Mr Bush just ahead there. The vice-president has become more expansive with the travelling press since the summer, but his message now is very much over the heads of the media and towards the great undecided. The crowd of around 2,000 in Court Square in downtown Memphis has been serenaded by no less then the Rev Al Green, Preston Shannon and Ruby Wilson, the cream of soul and rhythm and blues here. Wilson refers to Al Gore as our \"homeboy\" although homeboy may not be the first - or even the 101st - description that springs to mind when the vice-president bounds on stage with his wife Tipper and his daughter Kristin, a comedy script writer in Los Angeles. Memphis is a predominantly black town and that is reflected in the crowd. The rally has been arranged at speed - campaign headquarters in every swing state have been put on alert for a visit. The Team Tennessee youngsters working for Mr Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman have to make sure that the placards - tonight they say \"Tipper Rocks\", whatever that means - are handed out to willing hands to wave when the camera lights hit them. Mr Gore's voice has started to go - it cracks a couple of times during a speech delivered jacketless despite the damp. He finishes with the standard: \"I may not be the most exciting politician in the world - like Willie Herenton [the dashing local mayor] - but I will work for you each day and I will fight for you with all my heart.\" The Gore team is deliberately making no comment on the drink-driving story that has emerged from Mr Bush's distant past, but privately there is much glee, not least because of the Bush TV commercial beaming out in Tennessee tonight, which has him saying: \"I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their own actions.\" There's not much sleep in these final hours. Mr Gore will get between the sheets too late even to see Madonna endorsing him on Dave Letterman's Late Show: \"I'm a chick so who [else] would I vote for?\" Grey dawn Saturday, and a prayer meeting at the Peabody Hotel, Memphis. Then the motorcade takes Mr Gore out of his home state, his campaign here possibly concluded. He may not returns until he casts his vote in Carthage tomorrow. The motorcade blue-lights its way to the airport for a flight to Huntington, West Virginia. Here a small rally has supporters arranged strategically behind the vice-president nodding and smiling like loyal bankbenchers during televised question time in the House of Commons. Then there is the private trip to watch Al Junior playing football for his high school team in Washington, and finally on to chilly Pittsburgh. \"It ain't really cold, it just acts that way,\" the bearded airport employee tells the shivering arrivals. \"You've all been down in the South too long.\" The Wesley Centre African Methodist Episcopalian Zion church is the first stop here and has honoured Mr Gore with another stellar gospel choir singing Blessed Lord and O Happy Day as he arrives almost dead on time. If this race was decided on who has the best musical accompaniment Mr Gore would win by a landslide. Mr Bush's best shot so far seems to have been Hank Williams Jr: those heirs to famous names must stick together. The clear strategy in these last few days is no longer just to deliver the message, for everyone in these churches is converted, but to get people to persuade everyone they know to vote. Mr Gore presses the buttons again: affirmative action, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, the tragedy of Africa's Tutsis and the Hutus, the need for hate-crime legislation, his boyhood horror at seeing rings for tying up slaves in a mansion on the hill in Carthage, the threat to civil rights if Mr Bush is elected and appoints conservative judges to the supreme court. The last rally of Saturday is with another solid Democratic sector, the unions. They have organised a bash in Pittsburgh's Hot Metal Street. Here the audience is much whiter, big men from this old steel city in baseball caps and jackets, promising to get out the vote on the day. This is not so much a marathon as a steeplechase, vaulting the time and weather zones and plunging through the cold water of public scepticism. The finishing post is in sight. But first it's off to Fairmount park in the heart of the city of Brotherly Love on this glorious autumn day. On the whole, WC Fields said in his famous epitaph, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. On the whole, Al Gore would rather be anywhere than buried by George W Bush.So, one more time, the voice cracking: \"I will fight for you! I need your help!\" as Air Force II prepares to take off for the last destination of the day, a place in Iowa called Waterloo.",

When the cameras are gone I want the pressure still there to help.\" </p> <p>He criticised insurance companies following reports that some were demanding inflated premiums or rejecting applications altogether. </p> <p>The government will urge insurers to scrap rules requiring claimants to restore flooded homes to their previous condition, even if the old design, such as wooden floors, did not represent the best protection from further floods. </p> <p>\"I have received a lot of complaints about how slow they are dealing with claims and sometimes the work is not of a good quality,\" Mr Prescott said. </p> <p>Insurers warned yesterday that repeatedly flooded homes could become uninsurable. </p> <p>House prices could fall by as much as 25% in areas where the risk of flooding is highest. Once-desirable riverside properties have taken a knock in value, while homes in flood-devastated areas have been taken off the market. </p> <p>The Law Society will announce early next year that solicitors must include any \"environmental risk\" to a property - particularly flooding - when checking a house. </p> <p>The society has been liaising with the environment agency, which from next month will make flood risk information available to the public on its website, on a postcode basis. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"We have been working to produce an improved property search making a number of environmental questions standard. </p> <p>\"At the moment flood risk isn't routinely checked for in property searches by solicitors.\" </p> <p>The government is to change planning guidance for local authorities, making it easier to reject applications to build on land liable to flooding. </p> <p>Andrew Bennett, the Labour chairman of the environment select committee, claimed the government's housing policies were partly responsible for the flooding. </p> <p>He said the vast extension of house building meant water drained off the land into rivers far more quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. </p> <p>A 13-year-old boy died on Saturday after slipping on rain-sodden cliffs and plunging 60 feet onto rocks at Sharkham Point, near Brixham, South Devon. </p> <p>Although the weather was good at the time of the accident, the cliff tops were muddy and slippery after days of torrential rain and the rocks were treacherous.</p>",

About 50 villagers were evacuated afterwards and dozens have since complained of stinging faces, sore throats and stomach pains. Health officials later took blood samples from villagers and results are expected this week. As storms swept the country with 34mm of rain falling on Cornwall yesterday, Yorkshire remained the area worst affected seeing people evacuated from the village of Selby on Saturday night. Police guarded empty properties from looters while soldiers sandbagged river defences in the town centre. Inspector Malcolm Green of North Yorkshire police said: \"At the moment we are monitoring the height of the river very carefully.\" Deputy prime minister John Prescott spent another day touring flood-ravaged areas of Yorkshire and promised long-term assistance to help people get back on their feet. \"I would like to see a recovery team which is there as the people go through a process of change, finding accommodation, finding heaters, getting the insurance companies to help to quicken the process to relieve the damage they face and the misery. When the cameras are gone I want the pressure still there to help.\" He criticised insurance companies following reports that some were demanding inflated premiums or rejecting applications altogether. The government will urge insurers to scrap rules requiring claimants to restore flooded homes to their previous condition, even if the old design, such as wooden floors, did not represent the best protection from further floods. \"I have received a lot of complaints about how slow they are dealing with claims and sometimes the work is not of a good quality,\" Mr Prescott said. Insurers warned yesterday that repeatedly flooded homes could become uninsurable. House prices could fall by as much as 25% in areas where the risk of flooding is highest. Once-desirable riverside properties have taken a knock in value, while homes in flood-devastated areas have been taken off the market. The Law Society will announce early next year that solicitors must include any \"environmental risk\" to a property - particularly flooding - when checking a house. The society has been liaising with the environment agency, which from next month will make flood risk information available to the public on its website, on a postcode basis. A spokeswoman said: \"We have been working to produce an improved property search making a number of environmental questions standard. \"At the moment flood risk isn't routinely checked for in property searches by solicitors.\" The government is to change planning guidance for local authorities, making it easier to reject applications to build on land liable to flooding. Andrew Bennett, the Labour chairman of the environment select committee, claimed the government's housing policies were partly responsible for the flooding. He said the vast extension of house building meant water drained off the land into rivers far more quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. A 13-year-old boy died on Saturday after slipping on rain-sodden cliffs and plunging 60 feet onto rocks at Sharkham Point, near Brixham, South Devon. Although the weather was good at the time of the accident, the cliff tops were muddy and slippery after days of torrential rain and the rocks were treacherous.",

So my conscience is clear. As to that sensitive child out there, I know they exist, but maybe a good dose of the truth would be a warning for what\u2019s waiting. You seldom get a censorship attempt from a 14-year-old boy. It\u2019s the adults who get upset.\u201d</p> <p>Cormier was born into a large family in French Hill, a French-Canadian neighbourhood of Leominster, Massachusetts. The second of eight children, he showed an early flair for writing. He never lived further than three miles from the house where he was born and, for almost 30 years, he worked as a journalist on the local paper, covering everything from the police news to births, deaths and weddings. \u201cAll the stories I\u2019ll ever need are right here on Main Street,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until he was in his late 40s that he produced his first novel for teenagers. Thereafter, in his 13 books, Leominster became fictionalised as Monument and French Hill as Frenchtown, the latter most memorably in Cormier\u2019s last book, Frenchtown Summer, an elegiac account of a paperboy\u2019s journey to self-awareness as he walks the streets of his home town 50 years ago. As in all of Cormier\u2019s books there was a darkness lurking beneath the sunlit surface. As Cormier\u2019s editor was to note, the book might be hauntingly beautiful, but Cormier still managed to get a dead body into it. In the strongly autobiographical world of Cormier\u2019s novels, that was because there really had been one: when Cromier was a boy the town had been traumatised by a local murder.</p> <p>One of Cormier\u2019s greatest strengths as a writer, besides a rhythmic flow and brilliant use of simile and metaphor, was his ability to take ordinary American suburban life and show it from the perspective of the child who sees all the things that the adults have missed or prefer to ignore. Cormier\u2019s adults are often rather complacent, blissfully unaware of their offsprings angst or the dangers they are facing.</p> <p>The loneliness and sense of being an outsider that Cormier had experienced as a bookish child, who was picked upon in the street, became translated into a series of main characters who were all loners. \u201cI have always had a sense that we are all pretty much alone in life, particularly in adolescence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite this, Cormier, a genial man with a birdlike inquisitiveness, had a long and happy marriage to his wife Connie and raised four children. It was the experiences of one of his teenage sons, who refused as a matter of principle to take part in his school\u2019s annual fund-raising sale, that was to inspire The Chocolate War.</p> <p>When Cormier sent the novel to his agent he was surprised to be informed that he had written a book for teenagers. It was an approach that was to stand him in good stead. \u201cI simply write with an intelligent reader in mind.

In 1984, she was back on roller-skates in Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. Amid the hi-tech efficiency of Trevor Nunn's over-busy production, she once again caught the eye.

Succeeding Barbara Dickson and Angela Richards, she spent four years in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers. As well as appearing at the Phoenix Theatre, she also led the cast of the company that took the production to New York in 1993 where, thanks to the determination of producer Bill Kenwright, it survived mixed reviews.</p> <p>She was a renowned animal lover and someone who put her career before long-term relationships although she married Laurie Sautereau only this year. She also brought to the West End musical stage a luminous glamour that has been extinguished cruelly early.</p> <p>\u0095 Stephanie Lawrence, actress, born December 16 1949; died November 4 2000.</p>",

As I wrote in my review: \"The first number to really grab me was He Whistled At Me which worked because Stephanie Lawrence, as a pink-suited steam-buff, was allowed to stand centre-stage and communicate a recognisable human emotion: unfulfilled longing.\" Lawrence remained a popular figure on the musical scene. Succeeding Barbara Dickson and Angela Richards, she spent four years in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers. As well as appearing at the Phoenix Theatre, she also led the cast of the company that took the production to New York in 1993 where, thanks to the determination of producer Bill Kenwright, it survived mixed reviews. She was a renowned animal lover and someone who put her career before long-term relationships although she married Laurie Sautereau only this year. She also brought to the West End musical stage a luminous glamour that has been extinguished cruelly early. \u0095 Stephanie Lawrence, actress, born December 16 1949; died November 4 2000.",

      "body": "<p>A playing card-sized scrap of copper has given scholars unique insights into the engraving process invented by William Blake, which allowed him to produce his extraordinary illustrated books. </p> <p>The author of two of the most popular poems in the English language, Tyger Tyger and Jerusalem, was also an artist, visionary and mystic, who saw and spoke with angels while walking through Covent Garden in London. </p> <p>The fragment of copper printing plate is the only surviving example of Blake's relief etching technique, which allowed him to produce etchings as delicate and subtle as water colours. </p> <p>Robin Hamlyn, curator of the largest ever Blake exhibition, which opens at Tate Britain on Thursday, explained that the artist, never rich and often penniless, used and reused his etching plates, and on his death in 1827 those remaining in his studio were sold as scrap metal. </p> <p>\"This little piece of metal is of unique importance,\" he said. \"It is the only surviving piece in which we can actually see the hand of Blake at work on a relief etching, and watch how he achieved his effects.\" </p> <p>The plate, which has never been displayed in Britain, and is a loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, only survived by chance.

      "bodyText": "A playing card-sized scrap of copper has given scholars unique insights into the engraving process invented by William Blake, which allowed him to produce his extraordinary illustrated books. The author of two of the most popular poems in the English language, Tyger Tyger and Jerusalem, was also an artist, visionary and mystic, who saw and spoke with angels while walking through Covent Garden in London. The fragment of copper printing plate is the only surviving example of Blake's relief etching technique, which allowed him to produce etchings as delicate and subtle as water colours. Robin Hamlyn, curator of the largest ever Blake exhibition, which opens at Tate Britain on Thursday, explained that the artist, never rich and often penniless, used and reused his etching plates, and on his death in 1827 those remaining in his studio were sold as scrap metal. \"This little piece of metal is of unique importance,\" he said. \"It is the only surviving piece in which we can actually see the hand of Blake at work on a relief etching, and watch how he achieved his effects.\" The plate, which has never been displayed in Britain, and is a loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, only survived by chance. Blake had etched a frontispiece for his America a Prophecy on it, but did not use it. He then cut up the plate, and gave a piece of it to his pupil, Thomas Butts junior, who cut an unimpressive bearded figure on the blank back. It survived in his family's possessions, and its true significance was only realised long after master and pupil were dead. When Blake died aged 70 in 1827, he was almost penniless. He invented the engraving process, ironically, to allow him to mass produce his illustrated books and make his fortune. It proved so labour intensive, even with his wife Catherine colouring the plates and stitching the volumes, that he lost money on every rare occasion that he sold a book for 10s 6d. \"This is the largest Blake exhibition there has ever been,\" Christine Riding, co-curator, said. \"The Tate has borrowed from museums and private collectors all over the world - people have been extraordinarily generous.\" Of the 12 drawings for his first prophetic book, Tiriel, only nine are believed to survive, and the Tate curators have managed to borrow them all from six different owners: the Fitzwilliam and British museums, Yale, and three private collectors. All 100 plates from his last book, Jerusalem, now owned by Yale, are also on display together for the first time. Blake, son of a hosier, who never went to school and earned a living as a jobbing engraver, had a few devoted friends and passionate admirers, but was generally regarded as a fool or a madman.

      "body": "<p>The director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, has ordered an inquiry into a drugs and police corruption trial which collapsed after the judge identified serious improprieties by the prosecution team.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the inquiry will examine the actions of senior crown prosecution service officials, Kent police officers and the complaints investigation bureau, which was a Metropolitan police anti-corruption squad.</p> <p>The police squads masterminded a complex and expensive operation codenamed Nectarine lasting more than two years. It ended in humiliation last January at Maidstone crown court in Kent, when Judge Harvey Crush stopped proceedings against eight defendants, including a serving Met detective, accused of conspiracy to supply\u00a312m of cannabis.</p> <p>Two weeks later, Judge Crush returned to outline his reasons for stopping the case. His 42-page judgment was a scathing attack on the CPS and the police operation. Two months later, the DPP appointed two members of his personal staff to conduct an internal inquiry. Its existence is known only to a few officials.</p> <p>But the report, which is expected to land on Mr Calvert-Smith's desk next month, could have implications for the conduct of future prosecutions, especially those involving supergrasses.</p> <p>The DPP also took the unusual step of asking Stephen Wooler, the head of the CPS Inspectorate which investigates prosecution misconduct, to oversee the internal inquiry for thoroughness, integrity and independence.</p> <p>Mr Wooler said: \"There is no precedent for this situation. The review of this case is to see what lessons are to be learned.

      "bodyText": "The director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, has ordered an inquiry into a drugs and police corruption trial which collapsed after the judge identified serious improprieties by the prosecution team. The Guardian has learned that the inquiry will examine the actions of senior crown prosecution service officials, Kent police officers and the complaints investigation bureau, which was a Metropolitan police anti-corruption squad. The police squads masterminded a complex and expensive operation codenamed Nectarine lasting more than two years. It ended in humiliation last January at Maidstone crown court in Kent, when Judge Harvey Crush stopped proceedings against eight defendants, including a serving Met detective, accused of conspiracy to supply\u00a312m of cannabis. Two weeks later, Judge Crush returned to outline his reasons for stopping the case. His 42-page judgment was a scathing attack on the CPS and the police operation. Two months later, the DPP appointed two members of his personal staff to conduct an internal inquiry. Its existence is known only to a few officials. But the report, which is expected to land on Mr Calvert-Smith's desk next month, could have implications for the conduct of future prosecutions, especially those involving supergrasses. The DPP also took the unusual step of asking Stephen Wooler, the head of the CPS Inspectorate which investigates prosecution misconduct, to oversee the internal inquiry for thoroughness, integrity and independence. Mr Wooler said: \"There is no precedent for this situation. The review of this case is to see what lessons are to be learned. We are looking at all the issues Judge Crush raised.\" One of the defendants caught in Operation Nectarine was a drug trafficker, Richard Price, who after his arrest turned supergrass and implicated Met detective, John Bull. But Judge Crush discovered there were illegalities in the way the anti-corruption unit and Kent police officers had debriefed Price to obtain his evidence. It emerged during 11 weeks of legal argument - mainly about Price - that the police had offered him a \"sweetening deal\" worth \u00a337,000 which they kept secret. Judge Crush's judgment identified five key issues: \u0095 \"Wholesale breaches\" of three laws governing police investigation, preparation of evidence and conduct of trials. \u0095 \"Prosecution misbehaviour\" symptomatic of \"a culture of non disclosure\". \u0095 1,700 pages of \"significant\" police documents not disclosed to the defence. \u0095 A failure to record and retain police interviews with Price leading to doubts about the veracity of his written statement. \u0095 \"Pressure\" by police officers when debriefing Mr Price and a suggestion of financial inducements to implicate detective sergeant John Bull and other defendants. Judge Crush ordered that the defendants' costs should be paid from public funds. Philip Kelly, a defence solicitor in the case, last month made a substantial civil claim against Kent police for compensation on behalf of one of the defendants who had spent 13 months in custody. Mr Kelly said he hoped the DPP would make the report public. Mr Bull is still suspended on full pay pending a disciplinary hearing. He denies the charge. In a statement, the CPS said Judge Crush's criticisms were taken \"very seriously\". It continued: \"Naturally we are disappointed that none of the vast amount of evidence was ever tested before a jury.\"",

If the trend continues, more than 600 net closures will take place this year.</p> <p>The figures, released by the Department of Trade and Industry, show 145 closures in the first three months of this financial year and 188 in the second quarter.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year the Post Office could claim a network of 18,000 branches, the biggest single commercial network of outlets in Europe.</p> <p>In a new worrying twist for the government, the number of rural closures at the half-year stage has declined, but there has been a rapid increase in the number of post offices in towns shutting down, especially in poorer areas.</p> <p>The government is in large part responsible for the problem, as a result of its decision to switch payment of benefits from cash via post offices to automated payments direct into bank accounts.</p> <p>The Post Office has calculated it will lose \u00a3400m of business annually as a result of the move. The switch, which is taking place in stages, has removed one of the most profitable lines of business of local post offices - many derive more than 40% of their total income from benefit payments.</p> <p>Alan Johnson, the industry minister, is conducting research to discover the reasons behind the dramatic increase in urban closures.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, said: \"These figures are very worrying. We are getting pretty close to a collapse. Sub-post offices are voting with their feet and if the government does not act soon, the whole network will crumble.\"</p> <p>Many of the closures are due to sub-postmasters and mistresses either retiring or dying. The Post Office has then been unable to recruit replacements, leading to the enforced closures of the local post offices.</p> <p>The government has tried to plot a new future for the Post Office through its proposals for a universal bank. The bank, run jointly by the high-street banks and the Post Office, would offer accounts for the 5m British people who do not have an account, the so-called socially excluded.</p> <p>The Post Office has asked the banks for \u00a3130m to help set up this basic form of banking through its outlets.

      "bodyText": "The rate of closure of sub-post offices is accelerating rapidly, despite promises by the government to find them new business and reverse their collapse. Figures for the first two quarters of this financial year show 333 post offices have shut, only 49 fewer than closed in the whole of the previous financial year, in itself a record. If the trend continues, more than 600 net closures will take place this year. The figures, released by the Department of Trade and Industry, show 145 closures in the first three months of this financial year and 188 in the second quarter. At the beginning of the year the Post Office could claim a network of 18,000 branches, the biggest single commercial network of outlets in Europe. In a new worrying twist for the government, the number of rural closures at the half-year stage has declined, but there has been a rapid increase in the number of post offices in towns shutting down, especially in poorer areas. The government is in large part responsible for the problem, as a result of its decision to switch payment of benefits from cash via post offices to automated payments direct into bank accounts. The Post Office has calculated it will lose \u00a3400m of business annually as a result of the move. The switch, which is taking place in stages, has removed one of the most profitable lines of business of local post offices - many derive more than 40% of their total income from benefit payments. Alan Johnson, the industry minister, is conducting research to discover the reasons behind the dramatic increase in urban closures. The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, said: \"These figures are very worrying. We are getting pretty close to a collapse. Sub-post offices are voting with their feet and if the government does not act soon, the whole network will crumble.\" Many of the closures are due to sub-postmasters and mistresses either retiring or dying. The Post Office has then been unable to recruit replacements, leading to the enforced closures of the local post offices. The government has tried to plot a new future for the Post Office through its proposals for a universal bank. The bank, run jointly by the high-street banks and the Post Office, would offer accounts for the 5m British people who do not have an account, the so-called socially excluded. The Post Office has asked the banks for \u00a3130m to help set up this basic form of banking through its outlets. The new account would not provide overdraft facilities, a cheque book or direct payments except for utility bills. In addition, the banks would be expected to put cash machines in the local post offices. The government is trying to ensure a response from the banks by the end of the year. The speed-up in the rate of closures will be putting extra pressure on the government to deliver. But many of the high-street banks regard the proposed \u00a3130m payment as unfair and amounting to a voluntary tax. However, many of them know that they are politically vulnerable on the issue as a result of the rapid rate of closures of rural banks and the need to provide some form of alternative banking through post offices. The Cabinet Office published a report in the summer suggesting the rural post offices could also develop a role as one-stop shops for government services and as a distribution point for goods bought over the internet.",

      "body": "<p>Iraqi Airways, grounded since the Gulf war, resumed regular domestic flights through the western-imposed no-fly zones yesterday, striking a further psychological blow against British-backed sanctions.</p> <p>Two Russian-built aircraft took off from Saddam International airport in Baghdad for Basra, in the southern no-fly zone, and Mosul, in the northern zone.</p> <p>An Iraqi official said the airline had started with one flight a week to each destination by plane, but added that there would be extra flights by helicopter.</p> <p>The US and Britain imposed the no-fly zones in 1991 to protect Kurds in the north and Shia Muslims in the south from possible attack by Iraqi forces. Since then, both countries have led Iraq to believe that the ban on flights extended to civilian as well as military aircraft.</p> <p>As recently as last September, when the Guardian disclosed Iraq's plans for a resumption of civilian flights, western diplomatic sources maintained they would be an infringement of the zones. Britain and the US now say that they have no objection to the flights.</p> <p>Saddam's decision to resume domestic flights comes as the whole policy of sanctions is under unprecedented pressure. Although commercial flights to and from Iraq are still forbidden, thinly disguised \"humanitarian\" flights are now almost routine. One day last week, seven arrived from Turkey, Lebanon, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, all carrying officials and business delegations.</p> <p>In addition, high oil prices mean that Iraq now has more money to spend than at any time since the 1991 war. A total of 1,554 companies from 45 countries have sent delegations to the Baghdad trade fair, which continues until Friday. The biggest delegations are from France, Russia and China - all permanent members of the UN security council.</p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that the RAF would continue to enforce the no-fly zones, but \"if civil aircraft are flying in them it will be a factor we will take into account\".</p> <p>The US state department has said that, for safety reasons, it wants at least 48 hours' advance notice from Baghdad for each flight. But Iraqi officials refuse to give a warning because that would imply recognition of the no-fly zones.</p> <p>This means that western aircraft patrolling the zones will have to rely on their own \"friend or foe\" technology to distinguish between civilian and military flights. According to one military expert, these methods are not infallible.</p> <p>A further complication is that at least one of yesterday's civilian flights reportedly used a military aircraft.</p> <p>With Britain and the US already under pressure over Iraq's allegations of civilian casualties caused by bombing in the no-fly zones, the accidental shooting down of a passenger aircraft would be a disaster for western policy.</p> <p>Britain is also concerned about plans to reopen the oil pipeline between Iraq and Syria later this month. Diplomats say that Iraq intends illegally to export 200,000 barrels of oil a day through the pipeline, more than doubling the volume of the country's illegal oil sales.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposed exports to Syria would deprive ordinary Iraqis of humanitarian support if they were conducted outside the UN oil-for-food programme.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Iraqi Airways, grounded since the Gulf war, resumed regular domestic flights through the western-imposed no-fly zones yesterday, striking a further psychological blow against British-backed sanctions. Two Russian-built aircraft took off from Saddam International airport in Baghdad for Basra, in the southern no-fly zone, and Mosul, in the northern zone. An Iraqi official said the airline had started with one flight a week to each destination by plane, but added that there would be extra flights by helicopter. The US and Britain imposed the no-fly zones in 1991 to protect Kurds in the north and Shia Muslims in the south from possible attack by Iraqi forces. Since then, both countries have led Iraq to believe that the ban on flights extended to civilian as well as military aircraft. As recently as last September, when the Guardian disclosed Iraq's plans for a resumption of civilian flights, western diplomatic sources maintained they would be an infringement of the zones. Britain and the US now say that they have no objection to the flights. Saddam's decision to resume domestic flights comes as the whole policy of sanctions is under unprecedented pressure. Although commercial flights to and from Iraq are still forbidden, thinly disguised \"humanitarian\" flights are now almost routine. One day last week, seven arrived from Turkey, Lebanon, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, all carrying officials and business delegations. In addition, high oil prices mean that Iraq now has more money to spend than at any time since the 1991 war. A total of 1,554 companies from 45 countries have sent delegations to the Baghdad trade fair, which continues until Friday. The biggest delegations are from France, Russia and China - all permanent members of the UN security council. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that the RAF would continue to enforce the no-fly zones, but \"if civil aircraft are flying in them it will be a factor we will take into account\". The US state department has said that, for safety reasons, it wants at least 48 hours' advance notice from Baghdad for each flight. But Iraqi officials refuse to give a warning because that would imply recognition of the no-fly zones. This means that western aircraft patrolling the zones will have to rely on their own \"friend or foe\" technology to distinguish between civilian and military flights. According to one military expert, these methods are not infallible. A further complication is that at least one of yesterday's civilian flights reportedly used a military aircraft. With Britain and the US already under pressure over Iraq's allegations of civilian casualties caused by bombing in the no-fly zones, the accidental shooting down of a passenger aircraft would be a disaster for western policy. Britain is also concerned about plans to reopen the oil pipeline between Iraq and Syria later this month. Diplomats say that Iraq intends illegally to export 200,000 barrels of oil a day through the pipeline, more than doubling the volume of the country's illegal oil sales. A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposed exports to Syria would deprive ordinary Iraqis of humanitarian support if they were conducted outside the UN oil-for-food programme.",

When the Canadian stocks failed to recover, one explanation given was that the number of breeding adults was reduced so much that all their eggs were eaten by predators and their place in the ecosystem was taken by other fish. Another was that global warming had increased the water temperature and cod were no longer able to breed so successfully. Scientists have already warned that the North Sea is warmer and that cod survival is threatened for that reason alone.",

Just a gentle reminder to the many thousands of broadcasters, journalists, politicians, famous people and members of the public who have, in the past few weeks, informed me, through the various media and on a variety of subjects, that the \"law is an ass\" - Charles Dickens wrote no such thing. \"If the law supposes that,\" said Mr Bumble in Oliver Twist, \"the law is a ass, a idiot.\"",

      "body": "<p>What is the point of leaving parties? Why do we all pile into a wine bar on a wet Friday night to get to know somebody we will never see again? Professor Alec Reed, founder of the Academy of Enterprise, but better known as the chairman of Reed Employment, raised this simple question recently at a personnel conference in Harrogate as an illustration of how the relationship between employers and employees has changed. </p> <p>We supposedly live in an age of insecurity, of short-term contracts and temporary assignments. The trend took off during the recession at the start of the 1990s, but it has continued to grow as we near what statisticians count as full employment. The fly-by-night nature of temporary assignments makes it hard to estimate how many people are temping, but the best guess is that it is about 1.2m on any given day, and rising. About a quarter of these temps will be in secretarial or admin positions. But, argues Reed, it is employers who should feel insecure over this arrangement. </p> <p>As competition for staff increases, it is employers who will have to be more flexible in understanding what workers want. Reed cites the example of a senior manager in his own organisation who quit to train as a ballet dancer in Moscow.

      "bodyText": "What is the point of leaving parties? Why do we all pile into a wine bar on a wet Friday night to get to know somebody we will never see again? Professor Alec Reed, founder of the Academy of Enterprise, but better known as the chairman of Reed Employment, raised this simple question recently at a personnel conference in Harrogate as an illustration of how the relationship between employers and employees has changed. We supposedly live in an age of insecurity, of short-term contracts and temporary assignments. The trend took off during the recession at the start of the 1990s, but it has continued to grow as we near what statisticians count as full employment. The fly-by-night nature of temporary assignments makes it hard to estimate how many people are temping, but the best guess is that it is about 1.2m on any given day, and rising. About a quarter of these temps will be in secretarial or admin positions. But, argues Reed, it is employers who should feel insecure over this arrangement. As competition for staff increases, it is employers who will have to be more flexible in understanding what workers want. Reed cites the example of a senior manager in his own organisation who quit to train as a ballet dancer in Moscow. People at all levels have aspirations and unless employers learn to cultivate these they will lose their best workers. The old model of exemplary staff relations is gone - \"such traditonal employee champions as Marks &amp; Spencer are crumbling before our eyes,\" says Reed. Instead of paternalism, Reed advocates maternalism. \"In our maternal approach, we offer an interest-free loan to co-workers [Reed's term for employees], a home computer scheme, confidential counselling and free training.

But in Brown's recent settings of music by jazz composer and trumpeter Dave Douglas we see more than a coincidence of taste. We see Brown reinventing jazz as dance. </p> <p>In Five Part Weather Invention, Douglas's music takes a tour around a range of classical and vernacular themes.

Although Brown makes fleet and witty reference to the charleston and the lindy, the exuberance of these great party dances is present mostly as a kind of laidback hum. At first we miss the razzle of the originals - Brown offers only one tantalising variation on the acrobatics of the lindy - but the supple, rhythmic interplay between the dancers is so hypnotic that we find ourselves being sucked along in the piece's lazy wake. </p> <p>Rapture also offers some necessary relaxation after the intensity of the programme's middle work, set to music by Webern. Twelve Ton Rose (think 12-tone rows rather than female wrestling) is a series of scrupulously composed dances that perform extravagant and seemingly contradictory miracles. Sometimes they throw up images that look as randomly beautiful as things in nature - a staggered formation has the chance grandeur of a mountain range. Sometimes they are fraught with human will and emotion - a tautly sculpted female trio looks like a tragic monument. It is a remarkable feat, suggesting beauty as pure accident and pure artifice.

What we hear is a miasma of sumptuous sound that overwhelms with its headiness. Ozawa dawdles pruriently over the immaculately sensual woodwind solos, the flaring brass and the lushness of the LSO strings. The playing is breathtaking, but the interpretation doesn't really get to the heart of the piece. </p> <p>Strauss was, ultimately, less interested in beauty than psychology, and this is essentially a study in madness. Strauss's portrait of Cervantes's dotty hero depends for its effect on a weird double take. Don Quixote may be absurd, yet his cranky ideals have a moral worth and an emotional truth that far transcend the banal, painstakingly depicted reality through which he moves. When the emphasis is placed on sonority, much of the work's ambivalence is consequently undermined. </p> <p>Ozawa also gives the work the inauthentic double concerto treatment. Strauss employs solo cello and viola to characterise Quixote and Sancho Panza respectively, though he intended both lines to be played by the relevant orchestral section leaders. Ozawa uses no less than Mstislav Rostropovich and Yuri Bashmet, whose performances inject some much needed grit into the proceedings, and one's principal pleasure is derived from the interplay between the two. </p> <p>Rostropovich is \"The Knight of the Doleful Countenance\" incarnate. The shrieking glissando as he falls from his horse in his final battle is terrifying, while the shuddering tremor to which he dies is heart-rending. Bashmet is spectacular when he is depicting the squire's logorrhoea, playing elsewhere with a lyrical warmth that suggests his affectionate dependence on his master. When Rostropovich effectively had the podium to himself, Bashmet gazed at him with awestruck admiration, as well he might. </p> <p>The tone-poem was preceded by Beethoven's Second Symphony, which was scrupulously played, though lacking at times in interpretative cohesion, and frequently replacing genuine elation with frantic excitement.</p>",

While the use of coloured paper other than white for forms is seemingly irrelevant to a recruiter who has no reading difficulties, dyslexics often find pastel colours easier to read. </p> <p>Aptitude tests can also be modified. A first step, suggests the BDA, is to consult the dyslexic applicant to find out what adjustments might be required. Recruiters can help by allowing extra time for written papers where appropriate; 25% extra time is recommended. The importance of the entrance tests in relation to the job being applied for must be explained clearly to the candidate and alternative methods of eliciting the required information, such as verbal assessments and diagrams, should also be considered. </p> <p>With one in 10 people currently affected by dyslexia in a mild form, and one in 20 affected severely, a significant proportion of the population are at a disadvantage in the office. Juliet English, press officer at the BDA, insists that employers must wake up to today's workplace. \"The economic benefits of encouraging all employees to reach their full potential is obvious in business.\" She says that people calling attention to their dyslexia during the recruitment process and opening up dialogue with bosses will discourage the development of a culture of fear. </p> <p>How can administrators in particular make their lives easier? Suggesting small adjustments to the office environment, such as clearly labelled files, and tapes for dictation instead of written notes, can vastly improve individual working lives.

But it is not. A love of the macabre is what packs the crowds into this brutishly dark show each night. </p> <p>\"Oh, it's a body,\" a woman shrieks, stepping on something soft as she takes her front-row seat. It is, and there are bones sticking up about the place too. Later, when rain pours down on to the set the same woman gets a soaking. She smiles. Though neither moment is scripted, they sum up what this play is about: melodramatic thrills, horror and laughing in the face of it. </p> <p>The set, a festering box of tricks, is melodramatically lit like a haunted house with the cast of four slithering round it to narrate, and dip in and out of the chilling scenes. But there is too much in the way of narration from the Ludovic Kennedy book from which the play is adapted. Excessive \"female dominance\" in Christie's early life, says Kennedy, made him the horror he was. We then see Christie killing women, with repulsive details (\"urine and excreta coming from her after death\") and there is a queasy sense of a half-justification from the authority given to Kennedy's words. </p> <p>There is much to praise, however. The performances are horribly faultless, especially Rupert Farley's Christie, and the play does what it sets out to do: thrill darkly. It is not a serious study of Christie or a campaigning piece against the death penalty. Enjoyable in the same way as true-crime books are, this is a ghoulish, limited (and therefore safe, permissible) revelling in horror. </p> <p>Imagine the same kind of play about Fred and Rosemary West, however, and the bigger issues that dog this venture become clear. What exactly are we doing, sitting in a theatre, admiring the drama of all this? Why do we stay in our seats as Christie tells us of his attempts at sexual intercourse with freshly killed women? These are the questions the play avoids. And the absence of reflection renders this a well-executed (pun intended) piece of titillation rather than serious theatre. </p> <p>Until November 18.

      "bodyText": "It would be comforting to imagine that the reason crowds are flocking to see this production is concern about a miscarriage of justice - the fate of Timothy Evans, put to death for the murder of his wife and child, both victims of Christie in his notorious home. But it is not. A love of the macabre is what packs the crowds into this brutishly dark show each night. \"Oh, it's a body,\" a woman shrieks, stepping on something soft as she takes her front-row seat. It is, and there are bones sticking up about the place too. Later, when rain pours down on to the set the same woman gets a soaking. She smiles. Though neither moment is scripted, they sum up what this play is about: melodramatic thrills, horror and laughing in the face of it. The set, a festering box of tricks, is melodramatically lit like a haunted house with the cast of four slithering round it to narrate, and dip in and out of the chilling scenes. But there is too much in the way of narration from the Ludovic Kennedy book from which the play is adapted. Excessive \"female dominance\" in Christie's early life, says Kennedy, made him the horror he was. We then see Christie killing women, with repulsive details (\"urine and excreta coming from her after death\") and there is a queasy sense of a half-justification from the authority given to Kennedy's words. There is much to praise, however. The performances are horribly faultless, especially Rupert Farley's Christie, and the play does what it sets out to do: thrill darkly. It is not a serious study of Christie or a campaigning piece against the death penalty. Enjoyable in the same way as true-crime books are, this is a ghoulish, limited (and therefore safe, permissible) revelling in horror. Imagine the same kind of play about Fred and Rosemary West, however, and the bigger issues that dog this venture become clear. What exactly are we doing, sitting in a theatre, admiring the drama of all this? Why do we stay in our seats as Christie tells us of his attempts at sexual intercourse with freshly killed women? These are the questions the play avoids. And the absence of reflection renders this a well-executed (pun intended) piece of titillation rather than serious theatre. Until November 18.
