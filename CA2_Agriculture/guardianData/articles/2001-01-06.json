Peter Carey's skills, passions and obsessions are all fully on display in this long-awaited take on colonial Australia's most enduring myth. Ned Kelly, cattle thief, bank robber and folk hero, was hanged at the age of 25 in Melbourne jail in 1880. Carey tells his story in the first person, in a narrative - recalling Ondaatje's Billy the Kid, Hanson's Jesse James and perhaps even Burroughs's Dutch Schultz - that his publishers refer to as a dazzling act of ventriloquism. </p> <p>But this is not the short-lived gimmickry of ventriloquism; it is writing, and though the voice it renders is loud, distinctive and beguiling, the concessions made by Carey to the modern reader create several potential flaws in the construction that, to begin with at least, threaten to undermine the otherwise carefully woven illusion. Happily, Carey is far too accomplished and adventurous a writer to expect anything so simple or so obvious as the suspension of disbelief in the reader. Rather, he makes a valid and sustained plea for accommodation, for readers to bring all they think they know about Ned Kelly - all those half-remembered childhood memories of a man in the heat of an outback summer with a bucket on his head - and then to allow Carey himself to fill in the empty spaces that remain. We are not seriously expected to believe that this is a transcript of Kelly's own work; we are not so easily fooled by the archive sources cited; we are not so swiftly seduced by the atrocious punctuation in a narrative otherwise so finely tuned, plotted and controlled. </p> <p>What Carey demands of us is what he has been demanding for 20 years: that we trust the narrator of the tale as much as the tale being told, and that we don't unduly concern ourselves as readers with the mode of its telling. Ever since the playful, shape-changing stories of The Fat Man in History, Oscar and Lucinda, Jack Maggs and - supremely - Illywhacker, Carey has been talking out of the side of his mouth and behind his hand. He mumbles and whispers and then turns to face his reader with a look of mock surprise saying: \"What? What don't you believe?\" </p> <p>This Ned Kelly is a convincing and intriguing individual; Carey has indulged his appetite for language and imaginative construction in making him so. It does not matter that we are unable to pin Kelly to the facts of his life, only that we are willing and prepared to accept him as Carey reveals him to us, and to trust the kaleidoscopic array of characters and situations and the often startling images employed by Carey to create them. There is wonder here, and awe. </p> <p>Carey's narrators have always been storytellers in the truest sense. We have always been asked to believe what they are telling us while guessing or half-knowing that it is a well-turned pack of lies. Throughout his career, Carey has concerned himself above all with the image and the identity of his fellow Australians - from the earliest settlers struggling to understand the strangeness and precariousness of their lives and surroundings, to the disappointment and emptiness of contemporary urban man, detached from the vast and legend-filled spaces around him. This is nowhere more evident or more poignant than in those places and lives where only one or two generations might separate these extremes. These are the human spaces Carey inhabits, and at times he seems to have far more in common with his Victorian and Edwardian forbears - with Marcus Clark and Henry Handel Richardson, say - than with any of his more obvious contemporaries. </p> <p>There is little doubt that Carey the storyteller, Kelly the narrator and the tale being told are uniquely well matched. There is little doubt, either, where Carey's sympathies lie. He cannot be faulted for the shape and colour of the portrait he is painting when Kelly himself - the original Wild Colonial Boy - is telling the tale. History, Carey insists, is just as cruel to those figures it remembers (whether well, badly or indifferently) as to those it decently forgets. </p> <p>Kelly himself undoubtedly considered his reckless and ignorant bravery wholly justified, and understood as well as any of his later apologists and worshippers that he was the victim of the casually brutal wilderness and times he inhabited. Carey does little to alter this account. What he does achieve is a picture of a fuller, living man, about whom the reader need know nothing before he starts speaking. It is to Carey's great credit that, as the story progresses, the writer of the novel and the narrator of the tale it tells become indivisible. It is equally to his credit that Kelly's trademark ridiculous bucket headgear - my own abiding childhood memory - is not mentioned until 25 pages from the end of his account. </p> <p>Intriguingly, 10 years ago Robert Drewe published Our Sunshine, a fractured, unsentimental, \"poetic\" and compassionate first-person account of Kelly, of which Carey himself said: \"An important writer meets an important myth and reinvents it in the most sensual, visceral language he has yet produced.\" I anticipate that Robert Drewe will say exactly the same of Carey's Ned Kelly.</p>",

Punching the auto-pedicure button, I sit back and let the machine do its business while experimenting with the Russian verbs I just learned in my sleep. </p> <p>Today is Monday, and Monday is that rare thing - a working day. So I select a smart new flexi-garment from my revolving wardrobe (I'll decide later what colour to make it), grab a handful of breakfast pills and head for the jet-car bay. 'Where to, David?' says a pleasant voice as I lock the safety seat and brace myself for the exhilaration of sudden and rapid acceleration. </p> <p>'The office,' I reply. 'And skip the headlines this morning, Robbie. Ever since the World Harmony Accord, there hasn't been a scrap of news worth listening to.' </p> <p>Does this scenario sound familiar? If you were a child during the decades immediately following the second world war, it probably describes the sort of life you thought you would be living today - always assuming that an exchange of nuclear missiles hadn't reduced the surface of the planet to a sea of rippling green glass. </p> <p>Yet this Jetsons vision of a wipe-clean plastic world with cheap atomic energy and automated everything (in the 1962 TV cartoon series, the Jetson family even had a robot to take their dog for a walk) has proved to be laughably inaccurate on almost every count. </p> <p>Personal aircraft? Food pills? Unlimited leisure time? Total control of the climate? Not only did technology fail to deliver most of the promised goods, but in many respects it took us in the opposite direction, poisoning our food and making the weather wilder than anyone can remember. </p> <p>The fact is that predicting the relatively near future has always been a hazardous business. And no matter how much care would-be prophets take and how many experts they consult, their visions invariably tell future generations more about the concerns of the society that spawned their work than vice versa. And not only the concerns, but the quaint aesthetics, too. </p> <p>Do video collectors watch Things To Come, the 1936 William Cameron Menzies film based on the HG Wells novel with a slightly longer name, for its political insights? Read the reviews in the online shopping guides - it's the art-deco rocket ships that sell the tapes today. </p> <p>If there's no accounting for the taste of future generations, there's no foreseeing their hardware, either. Gizmos and contraptions provide much of the initial appeal of a futuristic work, but when the future arrives, they are just so many sticks with which to beat their author. Items of kit such as the anti-gravity belts and sonic ray guns that propelled the intergalactic swashbuckler Flash Gordon through the 30s have a troublesome habit of not being invented. Meanwhile, the internet, the personal computer and the Sony Walkman - the sort of innovations that really do change the texture of society - are conspicuous by their absence (poor old Flash didn't even have his own email address). </p> <p>Jules Verne went out of his way to check his science, yet he concluded that humans would be shot to the moon from the muzzles of 900ft cannon. At least Fritz Lang, whose 1926 film Metropolis rashly peopled the world of 2000 with beautiful robots and an oppressed race of subterranean workers, redeemed himself three years later by inventing the '5, 4, 3, 2, 1' countdown to blastoff in the film Woman In The Moon. </p> <p>It is the fate of any writer of cautionary tales, however, to sail dangerously close to the wind. For if the purpose in predicting the future is to describe a likely outcome of current events - to warn one's contemporaries that, if they carry on behaving as they are, then the results will be precisely as follows - he or she is bound to a short-term vision, with all the risks that this entails. </p> <p>Only George Orwell got away with it. He wrote a novel with a year for a title and managed to hit the nail on the head despite getting almost all the details wrong. Maybe it wasn't the right nail, but he hit it so hard that 1984 will always be with us. </p> <p>One response to the problem is to begin with the near future and just keep going. That way, if things turn out wrong in the short-term, you always get another chance to say, 'I told you so.' In 1930, the historian-turned-novelist Olaf Stapledon wrote Last And First Men, a vast history of the human species as set down by one of the last men and transmitted several trillion years backwards in time to us, the first men. Hopelessly flawed in its early chapters (Stapledon fails to foresee the coming war in Europe), this extraordinary book improves in leaps and bounds with the passing millennia, as humans master artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, taking to the air and, finally, to space. At one point, he has humans becoming extinct, only to be reinvented thousands of years down the line by the super-computers that had superseded them. </p> <p>Arthur C Clarke once described Stapledon as 'the most educated man I have ever met'; on the strength of Last And First Men, he is occasionally referred to as the Father Of Future History. Yet it is his short story Old Man In New World that contains by far the most poignant descriptions of a near future that was never to be. </p> <p>Written in 1943 and set in the closing years of the 20th century, Old Man paints a touching picture of Britain 25 years after the worldwide communist revolution that Stapledon believed would eventually follow the madness of the second world war, despite the best efforts of the US corporations. As it turned out, of course, it was those very corporations that fixed both our postwar present and our postwar vision of the future. </p> <p>In 1955, Disney opened the Tomorrowland section of its Californian theme park, Disneyland. Attractions of Tomorrowland included Autopia, 'the freeway of the future', and a huge Rocket To The Moon, alongside such awe-inspiring installations as the Bathroom Of Tomorrow, the Aluminum Hall Of Fame and the Monsanto House Of The Future. </p> <p>This last structure, sponsored by the future champions of GM food, was built out of a plastic so durable that, on retirement in 1967, it had to be sawn to pieces with hacksaws - a moral tale, if ever there was one. Tomorrowland was the embodiment of Jetson values. But if the plastic house was virtually indestructible, the spirit of optimism born of technological progress proved less so. With the dawning of the Age Of Aquarius, a more spiritually aware generation woke up and saw that the American Dream was something of a nightmare. </p> <p>The agony of the Vietnam war, the constant threat of nuclear annihilation, the failure of technology to cure most social ills, and its potential instead to cause untold damage to the health of the planet and its inhabitants, led to a wave of disillusionment with both the present and the future. </p> <p>Almost overnight, the urban space families of future fiction were supplanted by a population of shambling mutants, survivors of the nuclear holocaust to come. And when the nukes failed to go off as predicted, it was simply a case of switching the scenery and replacing the big bang either with some sort of eco-disaster, or with a descent into postmodern social chaos, Blade Runner-style. </p> <p>Either way, it was downhill all the way for the human species. Fragmentation and tribalism lay ahead, and the only consolation would be a few more electronic goodies for the rich to buy and the poor to steal - goodies which, as everybody knew, would be bound to pack up the very second their guarantees ran out. </p> <p>All of which presented Disney with a bit of a problem when it decided a couple of years back that it was time to give Tomorrowland a makeover. What were the options? A cyberpunk jungle of patched-up, malfunctioning technology - the sort of thing Terry Gilliam dreamed up for his 1985 film, Brazil? How about a fortified School Of The Future, or a Hospital Of Tomorrow, besieged by superbugs? Not in front of the children. </p> <p>Clearly, Disney had only one viable option - to return to yesteryear's images of the future. And so in a Garden Of Eden setting that plays to the new anti-urban, anti-technology trends in western society, today's Tomorrowland focuses on past visionaries such as Jules Verne, HG Wells and Leonardo da Vinci. </p> <p>'We're focusing on dreamlike images rather than updated images of tomorrow,' said a spokesman for the company. In other words, white-knuckle rides are one thing, but the future - the real low-rise, low-hope future of the present - is far too scary to contemplate.</p>",

No one is planning a space vacation this year, there are no moon bases or orbiting Hiltons. For about $6,000, you can have your ashes rocketed into orbit, but your chances of reaching space alive seem no better than they were a generation ago. </p> <p>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey now mocks us for our lack of cosmic achievements. Even science-fiction movies these days are tackier and less ambitious, though perhaps the special effects are better. As for real-life science, computers and biotechnology have gained ground exponentially, yet they have failed to help you, I or Joe Public escape the bonds of our planet. </p> <p>Space travel is one of the broken promises of our generation. It has stagnated for lack of willpower and money. No one has been to the moon in 25 years. A manned mission to Mars, which once seemed the next logical step, has been postponed indefinitely. </p> <p>The US-led International Space Station currently under construction one module at a time is an updated but conceptually-similar version of the 70s SkyLab. It will provide a permanently-manned platform in space to carry out experiments, and a way-station for future exploratory missions. But it bears scant resemblance to the spinning behemoth envisaged by Kubrick, with its artificial gravity, its bright red lounge furniture, and guests checking in at reception after flying in on a PanAm space cruiser.</p> <p>Moreover, space travel remains Nasa's near-exclusive domain, a government monopoly with little room for private endeavour. An attempt to put a fee-paying entrepreneur, Dennis Tito, into space this month collapsed when Mir, the rentable Russian space station, ran out of steam, leaving Tito with a $20 million ticket and nowhere to go. Mir is due to be incinerated in the earth's atmosphere in the next few weeks, and along with it the hopes of a buccaneering US-Russian joint venture called MirCorp, which had hoped to use the 13-year-old spaceship to compete with Nasa. The closest an ordinary citizen can get these days to a near-astronaut experience is to pay $5,000 for a trip in a Russian Ilyushin-76 at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City. The padded plane generates weightlessness by flying up and down at high altitude, like a stratospheric big dipper. Real space tourism seems as dead and remote as Pluto. Kubrick did not live to this sad day, but Sir Arthur C Clarke, the sci-fi novelist who sat down in 1964 to write the original 2001: A Space Odyssey, is still with us, 83 years old and confined to a wheelchair at his home in Sri Lanka, but stolidly determined to live out his fantasy and travel into space before he dies. </p> <p>Time is clearly running out for Clarke, but his dreams are not as untethered as they may sound. Beneath the outwardly moribund state of space travel, private enterprise is bubbling away volcanically, constantly threatening to break through and change our landscape for ever. Even now, millions of pounds and man-hours are being expended in the hunt for cheaper ways to escape gravity. Spacecraft are being designed, prototypes are being tested and speculative bookings are even being taken. Our space odyssey may not have started on time, but there is reason to believe it is about to begin. Aerospace experts believe sub-orbital trips, taking passengers into space for a few minutes with brief arching flights, will be regularly available to tourists within four years, and that large-scale tourism, complete with spinning hotels, is no more than two decades away.</p> <p>Right now, the chief obstacle to space travel is a sort of Catch-22 of extra-terrestrial accounting. It costs about $10,000 to launch a payload carrying a weight of one pound into space on a Nasa shuttle. An adult with a bit of baggage would cost more than $2 million and that is without bringing him or her back to earth safely. At that price, there is not much of a market for launchers, especially as the demand for satellites is slowing down. Without a serious market, there has not really been much of an incentive to spend the hundreds of millions of pounds necessary to research and develop the sort of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) that would reduce costs sufficiently to ignite real corporate interest in space.</p> <p>The Futron Corporation in Washington has calculated that even if a modern-day alchemist found a way to use zero-gravity conditions to turn lead into gold, it would still be impossible to make money at today's launch costs. Futron, which specialises in forecasting trends in commercial space, has conducted a study for Nasa that includes estimates of what it would take to get some of the \"emerging markets\" in space underway. According to Phil McAlister, a Futron engineer, \"Nothing really emerged in any significant magnitude until the price got down to about half of what it is today.\" </p> <p>Marco Carceres, another of the emerging breed of space analysts clustered around Washington, argues that to create the conditions for true space tourism, launch costs have to be brought down below $500 a pound. Once that is done, Carceres believes, \"Space tourism in one form or another is just about inevitable.\" The cheap RLV is the Holy Grail of space travel. Once you have one of those, everything else - from orbiting hotels to space travel to lunar factories - will follow. The cosmos will open its door wide and we will all pile in.</p> <p>The space shuttle was a promising start back when it was first conceived in the 70s, but it is an expensive way of taking things into space, costing five times more per pound than a Chinese rocket. In 1996, the US government and Nasa commissioned Lockheed Martin to develop a new generation of RLV, but funds have dried up with the end of the Cold War and its competitive impulse. Lockheed Martin's RLV project, the X-33, lies in pieces in a California aeroplane hangar after exhausting its $1.2 billion budget. A successor project, VentureStar, is stranded on the drawing-board for lack of funds. </p> <p>Back in the mid-80s, the Thatcher government was also a player in the RLV quest. The British National Space Centre was established principally to work on the problem. The centre designed the Hotol (horizontal take-off and landing) craft that was to be built jointly by British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce. Hotol would have been a sleek and elegant craft, somewhat reminiscent of the Concorde, powered by revolutionary engines. But as usual with such ambitious ventures in Britain, there was not enough cash to get it off the ground. When the defence secretary at the time, Michael Heseltine, declared the Hotol engine \"top secret\", the plan was doomed because there was no way of sharing its development costs with European partners.</p> <p>Since the collapse of these oversized government projects, the stage is set for private enterprise to pick up the torch. All it will take is a flash of engineering insight, some financial backing and the right kind of economic incentives - which is where the X-Prize comes in. </p> <p>The X-Prize, set up by US aerospace engineer Peter Diamandis, is worth $10 million, and all you have to do to win it is build a craft that will take three people 100km through the planet's atmosphere into sub-orbital flight and bring them back down to earth again. And then repeat the performance within a fortnight. The award is offered by a consortium of private investors and there are 19 teams from five countries in the race.</p> <p>One of the contenders is a former British Aerospace rocket scientist called David Ashford, who retired 10 years to set up a company called Bristol Spaceplanes, and to design a rocket-driven craft to pierce the atmosphere. He has come up with a sleek-looking plane called the Ascender. The Ascender would use its rockets to thrust itself almost vertically upwards at three times the speed of sound, until it reached the requisite 100km altitude before gliding back to an airfield landing. In all, it would be a 30-minute flight, including two minutes of precious weightlessness for the two crew and two passengers, who would clearly see the blue curvature of the earth below and the blackness of space beyond. And the Ascender would be robust enough to repeat the exercise several times a day.</p> <p>Ashford points out that all this has been done before, by the US experimental rocket-plane, the X-15, which broke altitude records in the 60s with its sub-orbital flights. With a slightly bigger cockpit, it would have won the X-Prize decades ago, but Ashford argues that rocket-plane technology was shelved in the Cold War race to get into orbit first. \"What we've had since then are manned spacecraft powered by ballistic missiles. It's not a safe or natural way of getting into space and no one would have thought of doing it if not for the Cold War,\" he says. \"It's expendable so you can't test it before you use it, and that's why it's so expensive.\" The X-15 used to cost $2 million per flight, but Ashford believes that with the technological advances in rocket motors and airframes over the past 40 years, that cost could be cut to a fraction.</p> <p>Ashford gets a lot of respect for his abilities as a designer, but he has so far not been able to transform respect into solid financial backing. He is still working out of a converted children's playroom at home, unlike his chief US rival for the prize, Burt Rutan, who has his own aviation workshop.</p> <p>In San Bruno, California, a private group has taken an entirely different approach. The Rotary Rocket Company is working on a prototype reusable rocket called the Roton, which as its name suggests is powered by a rotating engine, and equipped with helicopter-like rotors to break its descent through the earth's atmosphere. It has yet to lift more than a few feet off the ground in test flights earlier this year, but its makers remain hopeful it will be rising through the ionosphere within the next 24 months. </p> <p>Another design, being worked on at the Georgia Institute of Technology, would send a needle-like rocket called the Argus shooting skyward along a 2.4km magnetic track, of the sort that drives friction-free trains, before rocket engines would kick in to take the Argus into orbit.</p> <p>Whoever wins the X-Prize, the implications are likely to be explosive. By pioneering an affordable way through the atmosphere, the victor will have once and for all pierced the membrane keeping private enterprise anchored to the earth. \"Once you have low-cost access to orbit, the construction of a space hotel is a very straightforward piece of engineering,\" Ashford says. \"The best prediction I have is that within 15 years space tourism will be affordable by middle-income people - that means about a million people a year could go. Somebody has got to have a breakthrough, and when it happens it will happen very fast.\"</p> <p>If that moment does come, there are no shortage of would-be space hoteliers ready to accommodate us. A string of rival space hotel plans are already in development by would-be \"astropreneurs\", space tycoons who have made their money on earth and want to buy back the dreams of space adventure they grew up with.</p> <p>Gene Meyers is a good example. When he was 10 years old, he went to school carrying a lunch-box emblazoned with a colourful picture of an imaginary space station - a great multi-hued wheel spinning among the stars. Among the must-have lunch-boxes of the mid-50s, Meyers recalls, it was either that or a stick-on portrait of Davy Crockett. Meyers liked the space station best.</p> <p>The design was marketed by Disney, but dreamed up by Wernher von Braun, the German wartime rocket scientist who godfathered the US space programme. Back then, years before Yuri Gagarin was strapped to the top of a Russian rocket, the spinning wheel belonged in the realm of fantasy. But it was inspired by sound physics, and the image stuck in the Californian schoolboy's mind. Thirteen years later, that familiar spinning wheel appeared again, more vividly this time, in Kubrick's landmark film. By this time, in 1968, Meyers was a young engineering graduate, and the spinning wheel was no longer a pure science-fiction fantasy. The Apollo programme was in full swing and the conquest of the moon was only months away. </p> <p>Meyers went on to become a successful industrial engineer, but saw his cosmic dreams turn cruelly to dust. Now, aged 57, he is determined to make the spinning wheels of his youth a reality in his last few decades. Over the past 10 years, he has established a company in West Covina, California, devoted to the construction of a privately-run space station made out of discarded space shuttle fuel tanks - the great orange bullets on which the shuttles hurtle into space. Once joined together in space, these hulks will serve as a zero-gravity factory, laboratory and - perhaps most lucratively - as a space hotel. </p> <p>Meyers' company, the Space Island Group, hopes eventually to run an archipelago of way-stations between the earth and outer space. The Space Island brochure and promotional video offers an animator's impression of how Meyers' universe might look, with upgraded shuttles ferrying tourists up to these enormous orbiting islands. They are, of course, familiar, being the spiritual descendants of the double-ringed Hilton in the 2001 movie. </p> <p>Meyers is not abashed about the similarities. The islands, he promises, are going to be \"one of the most striking examples of life imitating art to come down the pike in many a year\". He has raised some seed capital and is negotiating a lease on offices near the space shuttle maintenance centre at Palmdale, California. Detailed technical diagrams have been drawn up and contracts are being handed out. He is so confident of success, he has hired a New York designer, Von Robinson, to work on the interiors. </p> <p>Robinson's main challenge is space-sickness, a disorder brought on by weightlessness that afflicts about 50% of all astronauts, and which would no doubt lay low a higher proportion of space tourists. \"It happens when your eyes tell you you're going in one direction, but your inner ear says you're going in another,\" explains Robinson. The solution, he argues, is to use gradations of colour along the walls to reinforce the visual sense of movement. Space sickness would be limited on the way up to the hotel by the lack of windows in the RLV. Passengers would instead watch a television view of the receding earth screened on the back of the seats in front of them, limiting the sort of sideways head movements that exacerbate space sickness. Robinson has just been in Italy, where he has been negotiating with contacts in the furniture trade about the design of an anti-tip chair for use in partial gravity. \"I feel like it's going to happen and I'm proud to be a part of it,\" he says.</p> <p>The Space Island project is far from the only venture in cosmic tourism underway at the dawn of 2001. A few hundred miles across the desert in Nevada, a motel mogul called Robert Bigelow is working on a rival project that aims to erect a space station out of inflatable tubular segments, and a huge space cruiser to whisk tourists of the future off on excursions around the moon. </p> <p>These are just the wealthy market leaders in space tourism. Behind them is growing an embryonic industry-in-waiting, with speculative travel firms accepting refundable down-payments on tickets to the stars, and earnest university courses dedicated to preparing the cosmic hoteliers of the future. What all these pioneers seem to have in common is a vivid memory of the glory days of Apollo and the promise of the Kubrick film, combined with a lot of disposable cash and a bitter sense of disappointment in the slow pace of space exploration since the 60s.</p> <p>Calls to Bigelow's headquarters are routed through his original company, BudgetSuites of America, specialists in cheap, very terrestrial, accommodation, but you are then diverted to his new venture, the optimistically-named Bigelow Aerospace, which is currently building a new block of offices in the shape of a rocket on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Bigelow spends much of his time criss-crossing the country trying to drum up interest in his ideas. </p> <p>\"There are a vast number of people that are very depressed and disappointed over the miserable progress since 1970,\" Bigelow says. \"Nasa didn't have vision. They had a particular national security outlook. They didn't want Soviets to establish a moon base so they went to the moon, but they didn't have an encore. They didn't know what to do next. There was a complete lack of imagination from the senior leadership of Nasa and the senior leadership at the White House.\"</p> <p>His decision to switch his attentions from the cut-throat hotel industry to the final frontier was motivated principally by boredom. \"You're taking a huge risk, but it's fun. I love the subject. I like to keep it fun,\" he reflects. \"By the time you struggle with business, raise a family, and you manage to get to the point when there is some time available, you say to yourself, 'Aha, some day, if you're still alive, you are going to do something . . .' I would like to think we could look back and think we made a difference.\"</p> <p>Gene Meyers is not discouraged, either. He believes his Space Island scheme is so radical, so cheap and so obvious that it can only be a matter of time before it captivates the cautious corporate world. It all started with a chance remark at an aerospace conference he attended 20 years ago. Someone happened to mention that when the 154ft high fuel tanks were first built in 1973, Nasa engineers explored ways in which they could serve a useful second existence in space. </p> <p>\"Those engineers suggested connecting them into a ring, maybe because they'd seen it in the film,\" Meyers said. \"They had the interiors divided up into three decks lengthwise and they showed how to put hooks in the walls to support them.\" </p> <p>In the end the plan was shelved as too ambitious, and the Freedom space station was planned instead. The shuttles dropped their external tanks 12 seconds before reaching orbit, allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere and drop into the ocean. In so doing, Meyers argues, Nasa is dumping a hugely valuable asset right under its nose. If the tanks could be joined together and converted into living quarters for tourists at $1,000 a day, hotel contractors could afford to pay $500 million for each discarded tank, more than the total cost of a shuttle launch. The tanks would be nudged into rotating rings by shuttles using the same space-construction technology designed for assembling the International Space Station. </p> <p>In that moment of epiphany two decades ago, Meyers saw the whole plan unfold in his head. Part of the spinning space station would be kitted out for life-support systems, some would be used for the zero-gravity manufacture of super-strong alloys and super-pure crystals, while the rest would be living quarters for the constant stream of tourists. </p> <p>The first guests will arrive by shuttle by 2007 at the latest, he predicts. They will travel within a passenger pod which would be released into space by the shuttle and then guided inside the core of the rotating space island by a pair of space-tugs. The clientele need never put on a spacesuit. Inside they would relax on Von Robinson's specially designed no-tip furniture and gaze out on the heavens.</p> <p>Everything is lined up, in fact, except the money. The first Space Island will cost an estimated $12 billion, so Meyers needs to sell some advance leases on their interiors to some heavy-duty corporations. Most of his working life these days is taken up by putting his pitch to would-be investors. He thought he had a deal with Hilton, which was initially charmed by the idea of bringing the Kubrick movie to life. The international chain even scheduled a symposium on space tourism for last month, but a management reshuffle killed the plan. Meyers' sympathisers were downgraded, and the California dreamer was back to square one.</p> <p>The great beauty of Robert Bigelow's rival space station is that it would require much less investment up front. It is, in principle, a set of inflatable tents that could be sent up on a rocket launcher with a set of basic assembly instructions. The inflatable sections, Bigelow says, would be made of a composite material including a form of Kevlar, rendering them light- and bullet-proof - able to withstand the constant pitting of space debris. The scheme sounds unlikely, but in fact Nasa has been toying with similar inflatable living quarters for years.</p> <p>There are a host of other RLV designs in development around the world, and a breakthrough is anticipated. The X-prize may help nudge things along, Peter Diamandis believes: \"Humans do their most creative and best work when they're competing.\"</p> <p>It will not happen in 2001, but some, such as Meyers, believe it will only take a few more years. Other, more phlegmatic, analysts such as Caceres think it could take a decade at least. But few people involved in this strange, visionary business doubt affordable space travel will happen one day, transforming our world and transcending it once and for all. The space odyssey has been postponed, not cancelled.</p>",

Another design, being worked on at the Georgia Institute of Technology, would send a needle-like rocket called the Argus shooting skyward along a 2.4km magnetic track, of the sort that drives friction-free trains, before rocket engines would kick in to take the Argus into orbit. Whoever wins the X-Prize, the implications are likely to be explosive. By pioneering an affordable way through the atmosphere, the victor will have once and for all pierced the membrane keeping private enterprise anchored to the earth. \"Once you have low-cost access to orbit, the construction of a space hotel is a very straightforward piece of engineering,\" Ashford says. \"The best prediction I have is that within 15 years space tourism will be affordable by middle-income people - that means about a million people a year could go. Somebody has got to have a breakthrough, and when it happens it will happen very fast.\" If that moment does come, there are no shortage of would-be space hoteliers ready to accommodate us. A string of rival space hotel plans are already in development by would-be \"astropreneurs\", space tycoons who have made their money on earth and want to buy back the dreams of space adventure they grew up with. Gene Meyers is a good example. When he was 10 years old, he went to school carrying a lunch-box emblazoned with a colourful picture of an imaginary space station - a great multi-hued wheel spinning among the stars. Among the must-have lunch-boxes of the mid-50s, Meyers recalls, it was either that or a stick-on portrait of Davy Crockett. Meyers liked the space station best. The design was marketed by Disney, but dreamed up by Wernher von Braun, the German wartime rocket scientist who godfathered the US space programme. Back then, years before Yuri Gagarin was strapped to the top of a Russian rocket, the spinning wheel belonged in the realm of fantasy. But it was inspired by sound physics, and the image stuck in the Californian schoolboy's mind. Thirteen years later, that familiar spinning wheel appeared again, more vividly this time, in Kubrick's landmark film. By this time, in 1968, Meyers was a young engineering graduate, and the spinning wheel was no longer a pure science-fiction fantasy. The Apollo programme was in full swing and the conquest of the moon was only months away. Meyers went on to become a successful industrial engineer, but saw his cosmic dreams turn cruelly to dust. Now, aged 57, he is determined to make the spinning wheels of his youth a reality in his last few decades. Over the past 10 years, he has established a company in West Covina, California, devoted to the construction of a privately-run space station made out of discarded space shuttle fuel tanks - the great orange bullets on which the shuttles hurtle into space. Once joined together in space, these hulks will serve as a zero-gravity factory, laboratory and - perhaps most lucratively - as a space hotel. Meyers' company, the Space Island Group, hopes eventually to run an archipelago of way-stations between the earth and outer space. The Space Island brochure and promotional video offers an animator's impression of how Meyers' universe might look, with upgraded shuttles ferrying tourists up to these enormous orbiting islands. They are, of course, familiar, being the spiritual descendants of the double-ringed Hilton in the 2001 movie. Meyers is not abashed about the similarities. The islands, he promises, are going to be \"one of the most striking examples of life imitating art to come down the pike in many a year\". He has raised some seed capital and is negotiating a lease on offices near the space shuttle maintenance centre at Palmdale, California. Detailed technical diagrams have been drawn up and contracts are being handed out. He is so confident of success, he has hired a New York designer, Von Robinson, to work on the interiors. Robinson's main challenge is space-sickness, a disorder brought on by weightlessness that afflicts about 50% of all astronauts, and which would no doubt lay low a higher proportion of space tourists. \"It happens when your eyes tell you you're going in one direction, but your inner ear says you're going in another,\" explains Robinson. The solution, he argues, is to use gradations of colour along the walls to reinforce the visual sense of movement. Space sickness would be limited on the way up to the hotel by the lack of windows in the RLV. Passengers would instead watch a television view of the receding earth screened on the back of the seats in front of them, limiting the sort of sideways head movements that exacerbate space sickness. Robinson has just been in Italy, where he has been negotiating with contacts in the furniture trade about the design of an anti-tip chair for use in partial gravity. \"I feel like it's going to happen and I'm proud to be a part of it,\" he says. The Space Island project is far from the only venture in cosmic tourism underway at the dawn of 2001. A few hundred miles across the desert in Nevada, a motel mogul called Robert Bigelow is working on a rival project that aims to erect a space station out of inflatable tubular segments, and a huge space cruiser to whisk tourists of the future off on excursions around the moon. These are just the wealthy market leaders in space tourism. Behind them is growing an embryonic industry-in-waiting, with speculative travel firms accepting refundable down-payments on tickets to the stars, and earnest university courses dedicated to preparing the cosmic hoteliers of the future. What all these pioneers seem to have in common is a vivid memory of the glory days of Apollo and the promise of the Kubrick film, combined with a lot of disposable cash and a bitter sense of disappointment in the slow pace of space exploration since the 60s. Calls to Bigelow's headquarters are routed through his original company, BudgetSuites of America, specialists in cheap, very terrestrial, accommodation, but you are then diverted to his new venture, the optimistically-named Bigelow Aerospace, which is currently building a new block of offices in the shape of a rocket on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Bigelow spends much of his time criss-crossing the country trying to drum up interest in his ideas. \"There are a vast number of people that are very depressed and disappointed over the miserable progress since 1970,\" Bigelow says. \"Nasa didn't have vision. They had a particular national security outlook. They didn't want Soviets to establish a moon base so they went to the moon, but they didn't have an encore. They didn't know what to do next. There was a complete lack of imagination from the senior leadership of Nasa and the senior leadership at the White House.\" His decision to switch his attentions from the cut-throat hotel industry to the final frontier was motivated principally by boredom. \"You're taking a huge risk, but it's fun. I love the subject. I like to keep it fun,\" he reflects. \"By the time you struggle with business, raise a family, and you manage to get to the point when there is some time available, you say to yourself, 'Aha, some day, if you're still alive, you are going to do something . . .' I would like to think we could look back and think we made a difference.\" Gene Meyers is not discouraged, either. He believes his Space Island scheme is so radical, so cheap and so obvious that it can only be a matter of time before it captivates the cautious corporate world. It all started with a chance remark at an aerospace conference he attended 20 years ago. Someone happened to mention that when the 154ft high fuel tanks were first built in 1973, Nasa engineers explored ways in which they could serve a useful second existence in space. \"Those engineers suggested connecting them into a ring, maybe because they'd seen it in the film,\" Meyers said. \"They had the interiors divided up into three decks lengthwise and they showed how to put hooks in the walls to support them.\" In the end the plan was shelved as too ambitious, and the Freedom space station was planned instead. The shuttles dropped their external tanks 12 seconds before reaching orbit, allowing them to burn up in the atmosphere and drop into the ocean. In so doing, Meyers argues, Nasa is dumping a hugely valuable asset right under its nose. If the tanks could be joined together and converted into living quarters for tourists at $1,000 a day, hotel contractors could afford to pay $500 million for each discarded tank, more than the total cost of a shuttle launch. The tanks would be nudged into rotating rings by shuttles using the same space-construction technology designed for assembling the International Space Station. In that moment of epiphany two decades ago, Meyers saw the whole plan unfold in his head. Part of the spinning space station would be kitted out for life-support systems, some would be used for the zero-gravity manufacture of super-strong alloys and super-pure crystals, while the rest would be living quarters for the constant stream of tourists. The first guests will arrive by shuttle by 2007 at the latest, he predicts. They will travel within a passenger pod which would be released into space by the shuttle and then guided inside the core of the rotating space island by a pair of space-tugs. The clientele need never put on a spacesuit. Inside they would relax on Von Robinson's specially designed no-tip furniture and gaze out on the heavens. Everything is lined up, in fact, except the money. The first Space Island will cost an estimated $12 billion, so Meyers needs to sell some advance leases on their interiors to some heavy-duty corporations. Most of his working life these days is taken up by putting his pitch to would-be investors. He thought he had a deal with Hilton, which was initially charmed by the idea of bringing the Kubrick movie to life. The international chain even scheduled a symposium on space tourism for last month, but a management reshuffle killed the plan. Meyers' sympathisers were downgraded, and the California dreamer was back to square one. The great beauty of Robert Bigelow's rival space station is that it would require much less investment up front. It is, in principle, a set of inflatable tents that could be sent up on a rocket launcher with a set of basic assembly instructions. The inflatable sections, Bigelow says, would be made of a composite material including a form of Kevlar, rendering them light- and bullet-proof - able to withstand the constant pitting of space debris. The scheme sounds unlikely, but in fact Nasa has been toying with similar inflatable living quarters for years. There are a host of other RLV designs in development around the world, and a breakthrough is anticipated. The X-prize may help nudge things along, Peter Diamandis believes: \"Humans do their most creative and best work when they're competing.\" It will not happen in 2001, but some, such as Meyers, believe it will only take a few more years. Other, more phlegmatic, analysts such as Caceres think it could take a decade at least. But few people involved in this strange, visionary business doubt affordable space travel will happen one day, transforming our world and transcending it once and for all. The space odyssey has been postponed, not cancelled.",

      "body": "<p>It is 1965, and at a cinema near you, The Sound Of Music is showing for the first time. And there's another new film with some catchy tunes - Doctor something... ah, yes, Zhivago. </p> <p>But never mind historical fiction.</p> <p>In the real world - the high-rise, hi-fidelity present - the future beckons. The Americans have just mastered the art of 'docking' two spacecraft, and even as we hum Lara's Theme, Early Bird, a satellite that will revolutionise telecommunications is being slung into orbit. By the end of the decade, they say, we'll have a man on the moon. There will be no holding us. Who knows what humankind will be doing by the end of the century? Who knows what our world will be like 12 months into the next millennium? </p> <p>In a Hertfordshire film studio, two men are doing their best to predict the answers to these very questions. The American director Stanley Kubrick and the English science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke are shooting a film called 2001: A Space Odyssey, and are determined that their fantasy will be entirely plausible. 'I never considered 2001 as a strict prediction,' Clarke will say in retrospect, 'but as more of a vision, a way things could work.' </p> <p>Yet their attention to detail verges on the obsessive. Will the first men on the moon see more stars than we can through our atmosphere? After much debate, they decide that they will. It is, as the Surveyor lunar probe will soon show, the right decision. They spare no effort in getting such minutiae right, consulting experts on everything from spacewalks to exploding bolts. </p> <p>But what of the broader vision? How clearly do they see what, for us, is now the present? At about the time he was debating stellar visibility, Clarke did make one prediction: by 2001, a colony 1,000-strong would be established on the moon. But even as he spoke, the US was sending its first combat troops into Vietnam. Years later, Clarke said that the sheer expense of Vietnam pushed serious space travel on to the slow-burner in the last decades of the 20th century.</p> <p>It goes without saying, then, that, in terms of its plot line, Space Odyssey is light years off beam. Patently, there is no colony on the moon. And although there has been an upturn in planetary exploration recently, the mapping and prospecting of the solar system is conducted exclusively by remote-controlled machines. Humans remain earthbound, or venture into orbit in small groups; the nearest we have come to the vast artificial moon that wheels silently through the early part of the film is the relatively unimpressive assemblage of labs and locker rooms of the International Space Station currently under construction.</p> <p>To say that the only lasting benefit from the space programme of the 60s is the non-stick frying pan is, of course, an exaggeration. But only a slight one. Sure, we've grown some enormous crystals, and our flying telescopes tell us awesome things about the universe. But it's hardly the bright future that flashed on to our screens in 1968. When the film was released, MGM issued journalists with a booklet setting it in context. Space travel, naturally, would be far advanced. The wheeling space station is served by a fleet of plush PanAm shuttles, and provides a springboard into deeper space while offering luxury hotel facilities for visiting VIPs. In the real world, MGM believed that commercial spacecraft would be making scheduled trips to the moon by 2001.</p> <p>Meanwhile, life on earth would have moved on apace. Terrestrial transportation would frequently include travel by ballistic rocket, reducing the maximum journey time anywhere on the planet to less than an hour. A dozen nuclear power stations would supply the US with all its electricity, and 'cancer, senility, mentally retarded children will no longer exist'. </p> <p>In his quest for veracity, Kubrick asked several firms to supply him with designs for possible future products, some of which appeared in the film or its publicity material. The result was that Space Odyssey always looked cool, whereas The Man From Uncle looked downright naff. One company, Hamilton, came up with a gadgetal wristwatch that would not look out of place in a modern high-street jeweller's. Parker produced an 'atomic pen' that would be perfectly convincing if only the word 'atomic' were replaced with 'turbo'. </p> <p>The 'smart ring' that American Express said would identify account holders is not a million miles away from today's smart card; the Whirlpool food dispensing galley would be at home in any burger bar; and as for the Bell Telephone videophone used by one character, well videophones are now a fact of life. </p> <p>Maybe Kubrick didn't predict that BBC reporters would no longer speak in BBC English, but from the Velcro footwear worn by the weightless flight attendants to the computer displays with their astounding graphics and modern typefaces, the film looked - and still looks - totally convincing. </p> <p>And the leading character? According to the MGM booklet, 'ultra-intelligent computers will be constructed within about the next 30 years', and these will be 'capable of performing every intellectual activity'. MGM was talking, of course, about HAL, the Discovery's all-singing, all-talking onboard super-computer that steals the show. But while artificial intelligence of the order displayed by HAL seemed an achievable goal to scientists in the mid-60s, the reality has fallen short of expectations.

      "bodyText": "It is 1965, and at a cinema near you, The Sound Of Music is showing for the first time. And there's another new film with some catchy tunes - Doctor something... ah, yes, Zhivago. But never mind historical fiction. In the real world - the high-rise, hi-fidelity present - the future beckons. The Americans have just mastered the art of 'docking' two spacecraft, and even as we hum Lara's Theme, Early Bird, a satellite that will revolutionise telecommunications is being slung into orbit. By the end of the decade, they say, we'll have a man on the moon. There will be no holding us. Who knows what humankind will be doing by the end of the century? Who knows what our world will be like 12 months into the next millennium? In a Hertfordshire film studio, two men are doing their best to predict the answers to these very questions. The American director Stanley Kubrick and the English science-fiction writer Arthur C Clarke are shooting a film called 2001: A Space Odyssey, and are determined that their fantasy will be entirely plausible. 'I never considered 2001 as a strict prediction,' Clarke will say in retrospect, 'but as more of a vision, a way things could work.' Yet their attention to detail verges on the obsessive. Will the first men on the moon see more stars than we can through our atmosphere? After much debate, they decide that they will. It is, as the Surveyor lunar probe will soon show, the right decision. They spare no effort in getting such minutiae right, consulting experts on everything from spacewalks to exploding bolts. But what of the broader vision? How clearly do they see what, for us, is now the present? At about the time he was debating stellar visibility, Clarke did make one prediction: by 2001, a colony 1,000-strong would be established on the moon. But even as he spoke, the US was sending its first combat troops into Vietnam. Years later, Clarke said that the sheer expense of Vietnam pushed serious space travel on to the slow-burner in the last decades of the 20th century. It goes without saying, then, that, in terms of its plot line, Space Odyssey is light years off beam. Patently, there is no colony on the moon. And although there has been an upturn in planetary exploration recently, the mapping and prospecting of the solar system is conducted exclusively by remote-controlled machines. Humans remain earthbound, or venture into orbit in small groups; the nearest we have come to the vast artificial moon that wheels silently through the early part of the film is the relatively unimpressive assemblage of labs and locker rooms of the International Space Station currently under construction. To say that the only lasting benefit from the space programme of the 60s is the non-stick frying pan is, of course, an exaggeration. But only a slight one. Sure, we've grown some enormous crystals, and our flying telescopes tell us awesome things about the universe. But it's hardly the bright future that flashed on to our screens in 1968. When the film was released, MGM issued journalists with a booklet setting it in context. Space travel, naturally, would be far advanced. The wheeling space station is served by a fleet of plush PanAm shuttles, and provides a springboard into deeper space while offering luxury hotel facilities for visiting VIPs. In the real world, MGM believed that commercial spacecraft would be making scheduled trips to the moon by 2001. Meanwhile, life on earth would have moved on apace. Terrestrial transportation would frequently include travel by ballistic rocket, reducing the maximum journey time anywhere on the planet to less than an hour. A dozen nuclear power stations would supply the US with all its electricity, and 'cancer, senility, mentally retarded children will no longer exist'. In his quest for veracity, Kubrick asked several firms to supply him with designs for possible future products, some of which appeared in the film or its publicity material. The result was that Space Odyssey always looked cool, whereas The Man From Uncle looked downright naff. One company, Hamilton, came up with a gadgetal wristwatch that would not look out of place in a modern high-street jeweller's. Parker produced an 'atomic pen' that would be perfectly convincing if only the word 'atomic' were replaced with 'turbo'. The 'smart ring' that American Express said would identify account holders is not a million miles away from today's smart card; the Whirlpool food dispensing galley would be at home in any burger bar; and as for the Bell Telephone videophone used by one character, well videophones are now a fact of life. Maybe Kubrick didn't predict that BBC reporters would no longer speak in BBC English, but from the Velcro footwear worn by the weightless flight attendants to the computer displays with their astounding graphics and modern typefaces, the film looked - and still looks - totally convincing. And the leading character? According to the MGM booklet, 'ultra-intelligent computers will be constructed within about the next 30 years', and these will be 'capable of performing every intellectual activity'. MGM was talking, of course, about HAL, the Discovery's all-singing, all-talking onboard super-computer that steals the show. But while artificial intelligence of the order displayed by HAL seemed an achievable goal to scientists in the mid-60s, the reality has fallen short of expectations. In terms of hardware, of course, all those knobs and flashing lights are already a thing of the past. Honeywell, Burroughs and IBM supplied Kubrick with projections for computer design in 2001, yet none foresaw the miniaturisation of computers or the invention of the Macintosh interface that would make it possible to take command of the Discovery using a mouse and a screen. But as for what HAL could do - as for what HAL was, even who HAL was - with the exception of his chess-playing skills, today's computers don't come close. Sure, they can speak, but they haven't a clue what they're on about. And while some can just about recognise human speech, their grasp of meaning is only about canine in terms of ability. They might peer through digital cameras instead of the whirring shutter that we hear on the Discovery at one point (oops!), but when it comes to scene analysis they still can't see for looking. The fact is that, in the 35 years since HAL was conceived, scientists have come to see just how distant is this goal called artificial intelligence. We might have cracked the hardware problems, but the software is another matter.

      "body": "<p><strong> Eilean Shona, Western Scotland</strong> <br> Lounging on Richard Branson's private Caribbean island may be beyond your wildest dreams, but his sister's equally lovely island of Eilean Shona on Loch Moidart in Inverness-shire is a distinct possibility. All you need to do is rustle up a large family or group of friends (up to 14, with a maximum of 10 adults) and the sum of \u00a37,000 between you. This buys you your very own country house and island for a week of open fires, four-poster beds, long walks on the beach, boating, picnics, seal-watching, tennis and piano-playing - with none of the responsibilities or chores. The housekeeping team of four will see to your every need. Eilean Shona is remote all right, though the overnight Scotrail sleeper from London's Euston station to Fort William makes light work of the distance. Further details: Eilean Shona 01967 431249. </p> <p> <strong> Petit St Vincent, The Grenadines</strong> <br> Petit St Vincent, or PSV to those in the know, is laid-back to the point of no return. From your private cottage on the soft white sands, you have the delicious feeling that no one in the whole world knows where you are, nor can they possibly reach you unless you choose to be accessed. Phones and TVs are part of another world. There's no need even to meet other guests and no pressure to appear in the bar and restaurant up on the hill. It's not self-catering exactly - staff meet all your requirements at the hoist of a flag. Yellow for room service, red for privacy. As the younger sister of St Vincent further up the chain, PSV is an island for lovers of understated luxury. One week's full board with Caribbean Connection (0870 7519310) from \u00a33,332pp in January. </p> <p> <strong> Bird Island, The Seychelles</strong> <br> A 40-minute flight from Mahe, Bird is the most northerly of the Seychelles; swim too far offshore and you will pass over the lip of the Seychelles bank and be hovering over a 6,000ft abyss. Walk all round the island, one foot in the sea, one on the sand, a three-mile journey that takes you to a sand and seascape that could pass for the end of the world. There are 24 detached cottages, among the best in the Seychelles, each with open-louvred sides and a king-size four-poster netted in white. The food is good, and the service with a smile. There are no Hobie cats, windsurfers or dive centres, and neither live music nor Muzak. You can swim in confidence in front of your cottage, or snorkel across the lagoon at the \"back\" of the island. And you can watch the birds. Just north of the Lodge is the summer nesting site of 3m sooty terns, one of the most amazing spectacles of the animal world. Two nights' B&amp;B Mahe, five nights' full-board Bird Island from \u00a31,543pp with BA Holidays (0870 600 0500) in August. </p> <p> <strong> Anguilla</strong> <br> Anguilla is famed for its exclusive hideaways, where Cap Juluca, with a one-to-one staff/guest ratio, sits in a 180-acre private estate, with a mile of white sand shared by a handful of Moorish-style villas. Its sister is the Malliouhana, also in the high-glamour bracket, with six French chefs in residence during the winter. Anguilla is a heaven of 33 squeaky white beaches, generally acknowledged to have no rivals in the Caribbean. And of them all, Shoal Bay is considered the winner, a favourite spot for picnics and snorkelling, now becoming more developed with the gentle arrival of villas and simple restaurants. From \u00a33,286pp with Complete Caribbean (01423 531031) for a week in January. </p> <p> <strong> Cephalonia</strong> <br> With more than 220km of coastline, Cephalonia has lots of beaches to shout about. Tiny, bijou Fiskardo, one of the prettiest Ionian harbours, is the hub of the action, its quaysides lined with 18th-century Venetian houses and a waterfront. While not exactly gold chains and Gucci loafers, it has a distinctly cosmopolitan feeling, and the Captain's Cabin does a roaring trade. If you prefer your beach bare, head to the wild, lonely expanses of sand down at the bottom of the raw corniche that cuts into the west coast cliffs. Assos is the place to stay, with a bed at the delightful cliffside Cavos Inn being hard to beat (ask Simply Travel, 020-8541 2202). For families, however, the more developed south coast is the only viable option, since it has the sandiest, most user-friendly beaches backed by lots of pines. Lassi is the main resort here with all the usual facilities. From \u00a3399pp for 14 nights' self-catering in July based on five sharing in Lassi with Thomson (0870 5502555). </p> <p> <strong> Koh Samui, Thailand</strong> <br> One of an archipelago of tropical islands off the south-east coast of central Thailand, an island paradise for beachcombers. You can either get there by boat from Surat Thani or fly direct to Samui airport. Either way, rent a Jeep as soon as you can for inland forays to coconut plantations and bamboo groves. The two most crowded beaches for bungalow \"villages\" and tourist hotels are Chaweng and Lamai in the east. But the sandy strands along the north, south and west coasts are more peaceful. Stay under the palms in a local bungalow on a deserted beach and you'll feel like Robinson Crusoe. From \u00a3799pp room only for a week in July with Magic of the Orient (01293 537700). </p> <p> <strong> Corfu</strong> <br> The passengers with the plummiest accents in the queue at Gatwick will undoubtedly be heading to the island's north-east corner. This stretch of coast is decidedly lovely, beginning just north of Nissaki and stopping in the hills just behind Kassiopi. Along the way, it takes in a series of magnificent tiny coves with small pebble beaches, crystal waters, decent tavernas and no hotels. Hooray for the 100 or so houses, monopolised by a handful of British tour operators, tucked into the greenery. Some are purpose-built, several are retired olive presses, many have pools, and some offer a cook as well as a daily maid service. From \u00a3400pp for a week's self-catering in July with CV Travel (0870 6060013). </p> <p> <strong> Barbados</strong> <br> When it comes to long-haul self-catering, the biggest flocks migrate to Barbados, which has more villas than any other island in the world. And we're not talking shacks on the beach. Properties range from simple cottages to luxurious villas, and there's precious little self in the catering. Every property has at least a maid, probably a cook, many a waitress, watchman and gardener. The bigger the party, the cheaper the holiday, and the sun, sea and talcum-sand formula is, of course, guaranteed. Just hand the cook your wallet and leave the shopping to her. As you mix a sundowner on your private veranda, allow yourself a few ounces of smugness. From \u00a3989pp for a week in January based on four sharing, with Owners Syndicate (020-7801 9801). </p> <p> <strong> Corsica</strong> <br> Napoleon claimed he could recognise the place before he saw it from the scent of the maquis that blankets the mountains, its tangy aroma a blend of lavender, rosemary, eucalyptus, honeysuckle, myrtle and thyme, which gave rise to Corsica's nickname, \"the scented isle\". Between the peaks are forests of beech, cork, pine, oak and chestnut, plus lakes, river, deep gorges and, down the eastern side, a 100km sandy beach. Self-catering is widely available in often luxurious villas but is most commonly in the form of studios, cottages or apartments in some 50 \"villages\" (ie attractive units spaced around a pool and bar/lounge area) around the island. From \u00a3584 for a week in July, villa for four with car, with Simply Corsica (020-8541 2200). </p> <p> <strong> Finnhamn, Sweden</strong> <br> Each June, Stockholmers abandon their city to frolic among the 24,000 islands of the Swedish archipelago. Follow in the ferries' wake to join in the long days' fun in Finnhamn. You'll stay at the youth hostel, a grand old wooden mansion called Utsikten (\"the View\"). Once the summer house of a coal merchant, you'll sleep in a stuga , a hut the size of a box of Swan Vestas, cook in the communal kitchen, and you can explore the island's woods and whispering reeds, climb outcrops of smooth pink rocks, picnic in grassy meadows and celebrate Midsummer's Eve like born-again Swedes. Flights to Stockholm from \u00a339 return in January (July fares yet to be published) with Ryanair (0870 3331231). Book the hostel direct on 00 46 8542 46212. </p> <p> <strong> Majorca</strong> If all you're looking for is a decent, friendly, three-star hotel that welcomes children, and has a safe, sandy beach and a handful of restaurants and lilo shops nearby, look no further than Majorca (pictured). The island is brimming with possibilities in resorts that range from Alcudia in the north to Cala Mondrago in the south-east. Hire a car if you can - it's essential to spend a little time exploring inland, the island is so gorgeously perfumed with orange and lemon groves and has entertained many a visitor in the monasteries and mountain villages of the north. If you prefer a villa hidden in the orange groves, head north-west where all manner of old farmhouses are available for hire in glorious valleys and fertile plains around Pollensa, 10 minutes from the prom and beach at Puerto Pollensa. <br>From \u00a3334pp in July, based on four sharing, with The Travel Club of Upminster (01708 225000). </p> <p> <strong> Mauritius</strong> Not, perhaps, the first destination a family may think of when planning its annual holiday yet, despite the distance from home, Mauritius is actually remarkably child-friendly. Overnight flights (11 hours) and minimal jetlag (four hours differnce) mean you're ready to enjoy the perfect white beaches almost immediately. There are flowers, forests, rare wildlife and nothing remotely dangerous. And best of all, most of its hotels, even the top of the range properties such as St Geran, Le Touessrok and The Royal Palm, all have children's clubs and positively welcome mini guests. Sugar Beach hotel is even more dedicated to families, with free water sports, gym, floodlit tennis courts, table tennis and games room. From \u00a31,399 in January with Somak (020-8423 3000). </p> <p> <strong> Andros, The Bahamas</strong> <br> The best of the Bahamas is to be found in the Out Islands. Take Andros, only a 15-minute hop from Nassau but far further removed in spirit. Andros is not only the bonefishing capital of the world, but less than a mile off the eastern shore is the second-largest coral reef outside Australia, stretching the entire 100-mile length of the island. From the shore to the edge of the reef, the depth of water averages 6-12ft, ideal for snorkellers and L-plate divers. Fully-certified diving instructors, needless to say, are always on hand. From \u00a31,321pp all-inclusive for a week in January with Discover the Bahamas (01737 218803), or \u00a31,567pp to include three dives per day. </p> <p> <strong> Heron Island, The Great Barrier Reef</strong> <br> Australia's Great Barrier Reef shares the super-phenomena league with the Himalayas, the Sahara and the Grand Canyon. It's a 2,000km-long, up to 90km-wide chain of reefs, cays and atolls. Stay right on top of the action. Heron Island is a natural wonder, small enough to saunter around in 30 minutes and home to a resort and research station but otherwise nothing. Paddle out, and within a second you'll see coral. Swim along the shallow walls or take a dive which can be arranged through the resort. And yes, there are herons, picking their way along the reef tops at low tide. From \u00a31,501 for a week's full-board with Bridge The World (020-7734 7447). </p> <p> <strong> The Maldives</strong> <br> The most dreamed about islands in the world, yet perhaps among the least understood, they add up to more than 1,000 clustered in two dozen atolls some 400 miles south west of India. Some are tourist islands, some local islands, most are uninhabited. Choose your island carefully (hopping is not easy or cheap) and head underwater. Going to the Maldives without snorkelling - or, better still, diving - is like going to the Himalayas without trekking. All resort islands have a diving school where beginners can learn the basics, a much more appealing prospect in the silky waters of the Indian Ocean than in the chilly public baths at home. From \u00a3931pp a week B&amp;B on Baros in January with Kuoni (01306 740500). </p> <p> <strong> Bali</strong> <br> Despite the South Seas' image, it is the hilly countryside, tiered by emerald rice paddies, that makes Bali special, not its beaches. So rather than a waterside hotel, head for the hills around Ubud, the art heart of Bali. Here, the Amandari is the chic address, built like an intimate hamlet on the edge of an escarpment. The hotel is one of three stunningly beautiful, stunningly expensive Aman resorts. The understated, more hideaway Kupu Kupu Barong, with dramatic views over the gorge, is a viable and less expensive alternative. From \u00a3665pp for five nights with Sovereign (08705 768373). </p> <p> <strong> St Bart's</strong> <br> With planning permission hard to come by, and high rise hotels unknown, it's no wonder St Bart's is able to preserve its atmosphere of quiet intimacy. Celebrities love it, lured by the tropical scenery, palm-fringed beaches and cosmpolitan atmosphere. By day, Gustavia, the capital, is bustling, its harbour dotted with gleaming yachts and schooners. Tourists browse through Ralph Lauren, Versace and Gucci boutiques and stock up on island-life souvenirs. By night, the tourists are back in force, sipping cocktails at the island's numerous bars and dining on fresh seafood. As a French dependency, St Bart's has a reputation as a gastronomic Mecca, so chefs from all over France will make a pilgrimage at some point in their careers, some staying on and opening their own restaurants. Add stunning mountain scenery, unfeasibly blue sea and a friendly, relaxed pace and St Bart's is jolie near perfect. From \u00a32,222pp for a week's B&amp;B with Caribtours (020-7581 3517). </p> <p> <strong> Costa Smeralda, Sardinia</strong> <br> The Emerald Coast, Sardinia's luxury north-east corner, earned its name from its pale green, transparent waters, which have made it a playground for the mega-rich and a yacht paradise. Short enough to drive in a few minutes, the Costa Smeralda was \"discovered\" in the early 60s by a group of property developers led by the Aga Khan, who transformed it into a tastefully landscaped strip of villas, apartments, hotels and restaurants. Exclusive properties are hidden above beautiful coves and surrounded by lawns so green and spongy they make Lord's Cricket Ground look like African scrub. Porto Cervo is the \"capital\" of the coast, where celebrities lounge on Bond-style launches and the poodles in the waterfront cafes are as pampered as their owners. From \u00a33,435pp for a week's half-board in July with Citalia (020-8686 5533). </p> <p> <strong> Ibiza</strong> <br> Ibiza would be worth visiting if only for its old town, the D'Alt Vila, a magnificent warren of lanes and old buildings contained by a remarkable renaissance wall. Galleries, stylish bars, romantic restaurants and small, chic hotels rub shoulders with each other within them. But Ibiza is arguably at its best by night, when there are three distinct zones: Ibiza Town, the most sophisticated; San Antonio, sadly sun, sex and booze; and the road in between the two being the most outrageous. After fish at the old town waterfront, go to Teatro Pereira, the old theatre, for decent live music and a fine long bar. Then go down to the marina for a drink at Izay, Keeper or Il Devino, followed perhaps by salsa at Indiana before going on to one of the many clubs that have made the island internationally famous. From \u00a3659pp room only in a small hotel in Ibiza Town, including flights, from The Real Spain 020-8686 3638. </p> <p> <strong> Key West</strong> <br> America's last resort comes at the end of the chain of islands that appear off Florida's southern shoreline, threaded to the Overseas Highway, the most beautiful dead-end street in the world. Although the climate is subtropical and the ambience Caribbean, the amenities are distinctly American. Famous former resident Ernest Hemingway called it \"the St Tropez of the poor\". Evenings begin in Mallory Square to watch, applaud, then toast with Michelob, Key West's famous fiery sunsets. From here, bars make up the bulk of the nightlife - there are many, from the famous Sloppy Joe's to the loud and rowdy Bull &amp; Whistle Bar on Duval Street. Live music, whether country, folk or rock is often a bonus, and no bars are more than a few minutes apart. From \u00a3672pp for a week in January with US Airtours (020-8559 7721). </p> <p> <strong> Cuba</strong><br> Let the group Buena Vista Social Club be your guide -there's far more to Cuba than the all-inclusive pile 'em high resort hotels in Varadero. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with more than 300 beaches, an impressive spine of mountains and a rich cultural history. Music is the round-the-clock entertainment, pulsating from every taxi, shop, restaurant and bar. There are enough live music and dance clubs to last a lifetime, let alone a week or two's holiday, predominantly in Havana, Santiago and Varadero. From \u00a31,229pp for two weeks' all-inclusive in July with Thomson (0870 2413156). </p> <p> <strong> Isle of Wight</strong> <br> When is abroad not abroad? When it's cast away 20 minutes off Britain's south coast. Blink and you'll miss the border crossing from Hampshire, despite the gentle ferry motion. Long favoured by royalty and writers and now kept afloat by a small, discerning and loyal clientele, the Isle of Wight is a Britain in bonsai. If you hear rumours of tacky resorts, fuel them. It will allow you to hug the stuff of childhood dreams to yourself - chalky cliffs, flat golden beaches, birdy mud flats, sweet-flowering meadows, Victorian resorts, sailing villages and dinosaur graveyards. B&amp;Bs and guesthouses abound, but victims of style may prefer the minimalist Biskra Beach Hotel on the sands at Ryde; or the more maritime and equally foodie Seaview Hotel in the village of Seaview. Wightlink (0990 820202) is the biggest operator. A two-night half-board package break costs from \u00a3109pp in July including ferry. Ferry only: 0870 5827744. </p> <p> <strong> Tresco, Isles of Scilly</strong> <br> On a boiling hot day, the blindingly white beaches and transparent turquoise waters of this archipelago of low-lying granite outcrops can more than match the Caribbean. The Isles of Scilly lie 28 miles off the western tip of Cornwall. Only five islands are inhabited, their appeal to holidaymakers the overwhelming flavour of a daily lifestyle that seems more appropriate to the pages of nursery rhymes than 21st-century realities. Because of the Gulf Stream, the islands certainly enjoy the warmest of British winters, which accounts for the profusion of plants that thrive in the famous Abbey Gardens on Tresco. Come to this island to breathe its purest airs and watch the sun and clouds cast brilliant shafts of light across its gentle scenery. There are only two places to stay - the New Inn (01720 422844) and the Island Hotel (01720 422883). The Information Centre (01720 422536) can point you in the right direction, but won't have a favourite. Boats and planes are bookable through the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company and Isles of Scilly Skybus on 08457 105555. Helicopters from Penzance are run by British International Helicopters (01736 363871). </p> <p> <strong> Lundy Island, Devon</strong> <br> Little has changed on Lundy since the Marisco family established itself here in the 12th century, using the shingle beaches and coves to terrorize shipping along the Bristol Channel. There are still only 20 permanent residents on this tiny, windswept island, although the enormous population of marine birds more than makes up for that. Breezy walking and filling your lungs with sea air is the thing to do here, since Lundy has no cars, just one pub and one shop. In April and May, you'll spot puffins coming ashore to mate; grey seals, however, bob offshore year round. The Landmark Trust in Bideford (01237 470422) has some fascinating houses to rent, from the remote Admiralty Lookout (no electricity, battery-pumped water) to the granite Barn hostel sleeping 14. A property sleeping four for a week in July costs from \u00a3532. </p> <p> <strong> Panarea, Italy</strong> <br> Usually, if it were at all possible, you would avoid Italy in August - overcrowded, overpriced and massively overheated. But Panarea is a cult island, a summer hub of Italian society and celebrity, with the Hotel Raya as the epicentre of cool. The island, floating well off Sicily's north-eastern corner, has been fashionable with Italians since the 1960s, when Antonioni came to film L'Avventura. This designer destination has no street lighting, no cars, little soul and hardly a beach, but there is always the Raya wth its colony of superb rooms with terraces and fantastic views. Citalia can tailor make a trip. Phone 020-8688 9989 for details. </p> <p> <strong> Bora Bora, Polynesia</strong> <br> The name is synonymous with heaven, and the five-star bungalows, lush vegetation and white sandy beaches around an enormous turquoise lagoon are anybody's honeymoon dream. In reality, there are more attractive French Polynesian islands, but Bora Bora still has the cutting edge on fascination. Highlights of any holiday include a tour of the lagoon on a motorised pirogue, stopping for a picnic on a motu and for a shark and ray-feeding session; snorkelling and scuba diving; ascending Mount Pahia with a guide; and ending the day at a five-star hotel (the island is famous for some of the most spectacular hotels on earth) for a cocktail while watching a Polynesian dance performance. There are, incidentally, plenty of budget places to stay, including two camp sites. From \u00a32,215pp for a week with Holiday Options (01444 239999). </p> <p> <strong> Funzi Island</strong> <br> Africa's hottest destination, now challenging the Caribbean in terms of accommodation, flying time and price. But where is it? Just (and only just) off the coast of Kenya, separated from the mainland near Msambweni by a narrow channel you can walk across at low tide (though dhow trips from Bodo, due west, are popular and cheap). All life and happenings are focused on Funzi Village at the southern end. Funzi Beach Fishing Club is the place to stay - an upmarket tented camp sleeping only up to 12 in a grove of mango trees. Room prices include a stunning location, all watersports facilities, meals, drinks and transport. From here you can book crocodile-hunting trips up the Ramisi river and excursions to the island's gorgeous beaches and forested shores. From \u00a32,960pp for a week's full-board, available through Worldwide Journeys (020-7386 4646).</p>",

Every property has at least a maid, probably a cook, many a waitress, watchman and gardener. The bigger the party, the cheaper the holiday, and the sun, sea and talcum-sand formula is, of course, guaranteed. Just hand the cook your wallet and leave the shopping to her. As you mix a sundowner on your private veranda, allow yourself a few ounces of smugness. From \u00a3989pp for a week in January based on four sharing, with Owners Syndicate (020-7801 9801). Corsica Napoleon claimed he could recognise the place before he saw it from the scent of the maquis that blankets the mountains, its tangy aroma a blend of lavender, rosemary, eucalyptus, honeysuckle, myrtle and thyme, which gave rise to Corsica's nickname, \"the scented isle\". Between the peaks are forests of beech, cork, pine, oak and chestnut, plus lakes, river, deep gorges and, down the eastern side, a 100km sandy beach. Self-catering is widely available in often luxurious villas but is most commonly in the form of studios, cottages or apartments in some 50 \"villages\" (ie attractive units spaced around a pool and bar/lounge area) around the island. From \u00a3584 for a week in July, villa for four with car, with Simply Corsica (020-8541 2200). Finnhamn, Sweden Each June, Stockholmers abandon their city to frolic among the 24,000 islands of the Swedish archipelago. Follow in the ferries' wake to join in the long days' fun in Finnhamn. You'll stay at the youth hostel, a grand old wooden mansion called Utsikten (\"the View\"). Once the summer house of a coal merchant, you'll sleep in a stuga , a hut the size of a box of Swan Vestas, cook in the communal kitchen, and you can explore the island's woods and whispering reeds, climb outcrops of smooth pink rocks, picnic in grassy meadows and celebrate Midsummer's Eve like born-again Swedes. Flights to Stockholm from \u00a339 return in January (July fares yet to be published) with Ryanair (0870 3331231). Book the hostel direct on 00 46 8542 46212. Majorca If all you're looking for is a decent, friendly, three-star hotel that welcomes children, and has a safe, sandy beach and a handful of restaurants and lilo shops nearby, look no further than Majorca (pictured). The island is brimming with possibilities in resorts that range from Alcudia in the north to Cala Mondrago in the south-east. Hire a car if you can - it's essential to spend a little time exploring inland, the island is so gorgeously perfumed with orange and lemon groves and has entertained many a visitor in the monasteries and mountain villages of the north. If you prefer a villa hidden in the orange groves, head north-west where all manner of old farmhouses are available for hire in glorious valleys and fertile plains around Pollensa, 10 minutes from the prom and beach at Puerto Pollensa. From \u00a3334pp in July, based on four sharing, with The Travel Club of Upminster (01708 225000). Mauritius Not, perhaps, the first destination a family may think of when planning its annual holiday yet, despite the distance from home, Mauritius is actually remarkably child-friendly. Overnight flights (11 hours) and minimal jetlag (four hours differnce) mean you're ready to enjoy the perfect white beaches almost immediately. There are flowers, forests, rare wildlife and nothing remotely dangerous. And best of all, most of its hotels, even the top of the range properties such as St Geran, Le Touessrok and The Royal Palm, all have children's clubs and positively welcome mini guests. Sugar Beach hotel is even more dedicated to families, with free water sports, gym, floodlit tennis courts, table tennis and games room. From \u00a31,399 in January with Somak (020-8423 3000). Andros, The Bahamas The best of the Bahamas is to be found in the Out Islands. Take Andros, only a 15-minute hop from Nassau but far further removed in spirit. Andros is not only the bonefishing capital of the world, but less than a mile off the eastern shore is the second-largest coral reef outside Australia, stretching the entire 100-mile length of the island. From the shore to the edge of the reef, the depth of water averages 6-12ft, ideal for snorkellers and L-plate divers. Fully-certified diving instructors, needless to say, are always on hand. From \u00a31,321pp all-inclusive for a week in January with Discover the Bahamas (01737 218803), or \u00a31,567pp to include three dives per day. Heron Island, The Great Barrier Reef Australia's Great Barrier Reef shares the super-phenomena league with the Himalayas, the Sahara and the Grand Canyon. It's a 2,000km-long, up to 90km-wide chain of reefs, cays and atolls. Stay right on top of the action. Heron Island is a natural wonder, small enough to saunter around in 30 minutes and home to a resort and research station but otherwise nothing. Paddle out, and within a second you'll see coral. Swim along the shallow walls or take a dive which can be arranged through the resort. And yes, there are herons, picking their way along the reef tops at low tide. From \u00a31,501 for a week's full-board with Bridge The World (020-7734 7447). The Maldives The most dreamed about islands in the world, yet perhaps among the least understood, they add up to more than 1,000 clustered in two dozen atolls some 400 miles south west of India. Some are tourist islands, some local islands, most are uninhabited. Choose your island carefully (hopping is not easy or cheap) and head underwater. Going to the Maldives without snorkelling - or, better still, diving - is like going to the Himalayas without trekking. All resort islands have a diving school where beginners can learn the basics, a much more appealing prospect in the silky waters of the Indian Ocean than in the chilly public baths at home. From \u00a3931pp a week B&amp;B on Baros in January with Kuoni (01306 740500). Bali Despite the South Seas' image, it is the hilly countryside, tiered by emerald rice paddies, that makes Bali special, not its beaches. So rather than a waterside hotel, head for the hills around Ubud, the art heart of Bali. Here, the Amandari is the chic address, built like an intimate hamlet on the edge of an escarpment. The hotel is one of three stunningly beautiful, stunningly expensive Aman resorts. The understated, more hideaway Kupu Kupu Barong, with dramatic views over the gorge, is a viable and less expensive alternative. From \u00a3665pp for five nights with Sovereign (08705 768373). St Bart's With planning permission hard to come by, and high rise hotels unknown, it's no wonder St Bart's is able to preserve its atmosphere of quiet intimacy. Celebrities love it, lured by the tropical scenery, palm-fringed beaches and cosmpolitan atmosphere. By day, Gustavia, the capital, is bustling, its harbour dotted with gleaming yachts and schooners. Tourists browse through Ralph Lauren, Versace and Gucci boutiques and stock up on island-life souvenirs. By night, the tourists are back in force, sipping cocktails at the island's numerous bars and dining on fresh seafood. As a French dependency, St Bart's has a reputation as a gastronomic Mecca, so chefs from all over France will make a pilgrimage at some point in their careers, some staying on and opening their own restaurants. Add stunning mountain scenery, unfeasibly blue sea and a friendly, relaxed pace and St Bart's is jolie near perfect. From \u00a32,222pp for a week's B&amp;B with Caribtours (020-7581 3517). Costa Smeralda, Sardinia The Emerald Coast, Sardinia's luxury north-east corner, earned its name from its pale green, transparent waters, which have made it a playground for the mega-rich and a yacht paradise. Short enough to drive in a few minutes, the Costa Smeralda was \"discovered\" in the early 60s by a group of property developers led by the Aga Khan, who transformed it into a tastefully landscaped strip of villas, apartments, hotels and restaurants. Exclusive properties are hidden above beautiful coves and surrounded by lawns so green and spongy they make Lord's Cricket Ground look like African scrub. Porto Cervo is the \"capital\" of the coast, where celebrities lounge on Bond-style launches and the poodles in the waterfront cafes are as pampered as their owners. From \u00a33,435pp for a week's half-board in July with Citalia (020-8686 5533). Ibiza Ibiza would be worth visiting if only for its old town, the D'Alt Vila, a magnificent warren of lanes and old buildings contained by a remarkable renaissance wall. Galleries, stylish bars, romantic restaurants and small, chic hotels rub shoulders with each other within them. But Ibiza is arguably at its best by night, when there are three distinct zones: Ibiza Town, the most sophisticated; San Antonio, sadly sun, sex and booze; and the road in between the two being the most outrageous. After fish at the old town waterfront, go to Teatro Pereira, the old theatre, for decent live music and a fine long bar. Then go down to the marina for a drink at Izay, Keeper or Il Devino, followed perhaps by salsa at Indiana before going on to one of the many clubs that have made the island internationally famous. From \u00a3659pp room only in a small hotel in Ibiza Town, including flights, from The Real Spain 020-8686 3638. Key West America's last resort comes at the end of the chain of islands that appear off Florida's southern shoreline, threaded to the Overseas Highway, the most beautiful dead-end street in the world. Although the climate is subtropical and the ambience Caribbean, the amenities are distinctly American. Famous former resident Ernest Hemingway called it \"the St Tropez of the poor\". Evenings begin in Mallory Square to watch, applaud, then toast with Michelob, Key West's famous fiery sunsets. From here, bars make up the bulk of the nightlife - there are many, from the famous Sloppy Joe's to the loud and rowdy Bull &amp; Whistle Bar on Duval Street. Live music, whether country, folk or rock is often a bonus, and no bars are more than a few minutes apart. From \u00a3672pp for a week in January with US Airtours (020-8559 7721). Cuba Let the group Buena Vista Social Club be your guide -there's far more to Cuba than the all-inclusive pile 'em high resort hotels in Varadero. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with more than 300 beaches, an impressive spine of mountains and a rich cultural history. Music is the round-the-clock entertainment, pulsating from every taxi, shop, restaurant and bar. There are enough live music and dance clubs to last a lifetime, let alone a week or two's holiday, predominantly in Havana, Santiago and Varadero. From \u00a31,229pp for two weeks' all-inclusive in July with Thomson (0870 2413156). Isle of Wight When is abroad not abroad? When it's cast away 20 minutes off Britain's south coast. Blink and you'll miss the border crossing from Hampshire, despite the gentle ferry motion. Long favoured by royalty and writers and now kept afloat by a small, discerning and loyal clientele, the Isle of Wight is a Britain in bonsai. If you hear rumours of tacky resorts, fuel them. It will allow you to hug the stuff of childhood dreams to yourself - chalky cliffs, flat golden beaches, birdy mud flats, sweet-flowering meadows, Victorian resorts, sailing villages and dinosaur graveyards. B&amp;Bs and guesthouses abound, but victims of style may prefer the minimalist Biskra Beach Hotel on the sands at Ryde; or the more maritime and equally foodie Seaview Hotel in the village of Seaview. Wightlink (0990 820202) is the biggest operator. A two-night half-board package break costs from \u00a3109pp in July including ferry. Ferry only: 0870 5827744. Tresco, Isles of Scilly On a boiling hot day, the blindingly white beaches and transparent turquoise waters of this archipelago of low-lying granite outcrops can more than match the Caribbean. The Isles of Scilly lie 28 miles off the western tip of Cornwall. Only five islands are inhabited, their appeal to holidaymakers the overwhelming flavour of a daily lifestyle that seems more appropriate to the pages of nursery rhymes than 21st-century realities. Because of the Gulf Stream, the islands certainly enjoy the warmest of British winters, which accounts for the profusion of plants that thrive in the famous Abbey Gardens on Tresco. Come to this island to breathe its purest airs and watch the sun and clouds cast brilliant shafts of light across its gentle scenery. There are only two places to stay - the New Inn (01720 422844) and the Island Hotel (01720 422883). The Information Centre (01720 422536) can point you in the right direction, but won't have a favourite. Boats and planes are bookable through the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company and Isles of Scilly Skybus on 08457 105555. Helicopters from Penzance are run by British International Helicopters (01736 363871). Lundy Island, Devon Little has changed on Lundy since the Marisco family established itself here in the 12th century, using the shingle beaches and coves to terrorize shipping along the Bristol Channel. There are still only 20 permanent residents on this tiny, windswept island, although the enormous population of marine birds more than makes up for that. Breezy walking and filling your lungs with sea air is the thing to do here, since Lundy has no cars, just one pub and one shop. In April and May, you'll spot puffins coming ashore to mate; grey seals, however, bob offshore year round. The Landmark Trust in Bideford (01237 470422) has some fascinating houses to rent, from the remote Admiralty Lookout (no electricity, battery-pumped water) to the granite Barn hostel sleeping 14. A property sleeping four for a week in July costs from \u00a3532. Panarea, Italy Usually, if it were at all possible, you would avoid Italy in August - overcrowded, overpriced and massively overheated. But Panarea is a cult island, a summer hub of Italian society and celebrity, with the Hotel Raya as the epicentre of cool. The island, floating well off Sicily's north-eastern corner, has been fashionable with Italians since the 1960s, when Antonioni came to film L'Avventura. This designer destination has no street lighting, no cars, little soul and hardly a beach, but there is always the Raya wth its colony of superb rooms with terraces and fantastic views. Citalia can tailor make a trip. Phone 020-8688 9989 for details. Bora Bora, Polynesia The name is synonymous with heaven, and the five-star bungalows, lush vegetation and white sandy beaches around an enormous turquoise lagoon are anybody's honeymoon dream. In reality, there are more attractive French Polynesian islands, but Bora Bora still has the cutting edge on fascination. Highlights of any holiday include a tour of the lagoon on a motorised pirogue, stopping for a picnic on a motu and for a shark and ray-feeding session; snorkelling and scuba diving; ascending Mount Pahia with a guide; and ending the day at a five-star hotel (the island is famous for some of the most spectacular hotels on earth) for a cocktail while watching a Polynesian dance performance. There are, incidentally, plenty of budget places to stay, including two camp sites. From \u00a32,215pp for a week with Holiday Options (01444 239999). Funzi Island Africa's hottest destination, now challenging the Caribbean in terms of accommodation, flying time and price. But where is it? Just (and only just) off the coast of Kenya, separated from the mainland near Msambweni by a narrow channel you can walk across at low tide (though dhow trips from Bodo, due west, are popular and cheap). All life and happenings are focused on Funzi Village at the southern end. Funzi Beach Fishing Club is the place to stay - an upmarket tented camp sleeping only up to 12 in a grove of mango trees. Room prices include a stunning location, all watersports facilities, meals, drinks and transport. From here you can book crocodile-hunting trips up the Ramisi river and excursions to the island's gorgeous beaches and forested shores. From \u00a32,960pp for a week's full-board, available through Worldwide Journeys (020-7386 4646).",

      "body": "<p>Before learning to play tennis, golf or cricket, you need to know how to hold the racquet, club or bat correctly. Before playing football, you must master the art of kicking the ball. And even Formula 1 drivers had to learn where the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals are, once upon a time. When learning to ski, before making a single turn, you need to pick up the basics of how to stand on your skis. This will be the position that you'll use when just going straight down the hill, known as the \"neutral position\". </p> <p>Only if you have a balanced, athletic, neutral position, will you be able to move your body into the correct shapes for turning. Even intermediate skiers often have faults that are caused by problems with their \"neutral position\", so please don't skip this article just because you already know how to turn! </p> <p>When you first put on a pair of skis, your instructor will hopefully make sure that you're on a completely flat surface. This way, you can get used to having planks attached to your feet without gravity taking a hand in proceedings. You'll learn to shuffle forwards, or push yourself with your poles. (That's if you have poles at this stage - many ski schools believe that they merely complicate matters, early on.) You'll also learn to step your skis around, pivoting them around their back ends, so that you avoid crossing your ski-tails. This is called the \"star turn\", after the pattern it leaves in the snow if you pivot fully through 360 degrees. </p> <p>On the flat, you'll also learn to lift one ski and stand on just one foot - and then to swap feet. This skill of shifting your weight from foot to foot will become invaluable as you progress to more advanced skiing. Good instructors will also show you how far forwards and backwards you can lean without falling over, because of the fore-aft support given by long skis and high, stiff boots. At first, it'll take you a while to realise how much support you get. But many intermediate skiers come to rely on it all too soon, and ski around leaning permanently back against their stiff-backed boots. It's important to remember that this fore-aft support is there to help you if you happen to get a little off balance. </p> <p>Normally you should be standing as much in the middle of the ski as possible. (Intermediate skiers can give themselves a \"refresher course\" in this by occasionally using ultra-short \"ski-boards\", thereby removing the usual fore-aft support.) Once you've climbed up the hill a short way, you'll be ready to try some \"straight running\". Ideally, your instructor will have chosen a slope with a slight uphill run-out at the bottom, so that you won't have to worry about stopping. (All beginner slopes at dry ski centres are designed this way.) </p> <p>Let's look at the neutral position you should try to adopt, working our way up the body. </p> <p> <strong> Feet: </strong> should be roughly hip-width apart, and relaxed, with your weight slightly on the balls of your feet. Many boot-fitting problems, especially foot cramps, are actually caused by people \"clenching\" their feet through anxiety - learn to relax from the beginning. </p> <p> <strong> Ankles:</strong> the most important joint for good skiing. It is a fallacy that ski boots lock your ankles solidly into place; they should flex enough to give you a fair degree of fore-aft movement. In the neutral position, you should be roughly in the middle of that range of movement. Your shins should be resting firmly against the front of your boots, but with the option to push further forwards, or flex backwards, if necessary. </p> <p> <strong> Knees:</strong> need to be slightly bent. Only if they're bent will you be able to use them for sideways edging movements. But if you bend only your knees, without bending your ankles, you'll end up leaning too far back. </p> <p> <strong> Waist:</strong> slightly flexed, so that your upper body is inclined forward a little. </p> <p> <strong> Back:</strong> should be slightly rounded, with the shoulders leaning forward. Many skiers, even quite experienced ones, believe they're somehow skiing \"elegantly\" if they keep their back ramrod stiff and completely upright, like a guardsman, but in fact they're limiting their range of movement. </p> <p> <strong> Arms:</strong> should be held in front of you, with the hands quite wide apart. They should be nearly straight, with your elbows just slightly flexed. Some instructors will tell you to visualise holding a tray of drinks, others holding a hoop. As long as your hands are where you can see them, just at the bottom of your field of vision, they're in the right place. Too many intermediates ski with \"lazy hands\" dangling by their sides, which means they're unable to use them to help their balance when they really need to. </p> <p> <strong> Head: </strong> your eyes should be level at all times (this applies through all levels of skiing), and you should be looking a short distance ahead of you, depending on your speed. Never look down at your ski tips. </p> <p>Overall, when in the neutral position, you should resemble a goalkeeper about to face a penalty kick: athletic, and ready to react.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before learning to play tennis, golf or cricket, you need to know how to hold the racquet, club or bat correctly. Before playing football, you must master the art of kicking the ball. And even Formula 1 drivers had to learn where the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals are, once upon a time. When learning to ski, before making a single turn, you need to pick up the basics of how to stand on your skis. This will be the position that you'll use when just going straight down the hill, known as the \"neutral position\". Only if you have a balanced, athletic, neutral position, will you be able to move your body into the correct shapes for turning. Even intermediate skiers often have faults that are caused by problems with their \"neutral position\", so please don't skip this article just because you already know how to turn! When you first put on a pair of skis, your instructor will hopefully make sure that you're on a completely flat surface. This way, you can get used to having planks attached to your feet without gravity taking a hand in proceedings. You'll learn to shuffle forwards, or push yourself with your poles. (That's if you have poles at this stage - many ski schools believe that they merely complicate matters, early on.) You'll also learn to step your skis around, pivoting them around their back ends, so that you avoid crossing your ski-tails. This is called the \"star turn\", after the pattern it leaves in the snow if you pivot fully through 360 degrees. On the flat, you'll also learn to lift one ski and stand on just one foot - and then to swap feet. This skill of shifting your weight from foot to foot will become invaluable as you progress to more advanced skiing. Good instructors will also show you how far forwards and backwards you can lean without falling over, because of the fore-aft support given by long skis and high, stiff boots. At first, it'll take you a while to realise how much support you get. But many intermediate skiers come to rely on it all too soon, and ski around leaning permanently back against their stiff-backed boots. It's important to remember that this fore-aft support is there to help you if you happen to get a little off balance. Normally you should be standing as much in the middle of the ski as possible. (Intermediate skiers can give themselves a \"refresher course\" in this by occasionally using ultra-short \"ski-boards\", thereby removing the usual fore-aft support.) Once you've climbed up the hill a short way, you'll be ready to try some \"straight running\". Ideally, your instructor will have chosen a slope with a slight uphill run-out at the bottom, so that you won't have to worry about stopping. (All beginner slopes at dry ski centres are designed this way.) Let's look at the neutral position you should try to adopt, working our way up the body. Feet: should be roughly hip-width apart, and relaxed, with your weight slightly on the balls of your feet. Many boot-fitting problems, especially foot cramps, are actually caused by people \"clenching\" their feet through anxiety - learn to relax from the beginning. Ankles: the most important joint for good skiing. It is a fallacy that ski boots lock your ankles solidly into place; they should flex enough to give you a fair degree of fore-aft movement. In the neutral position, you should be roughly in the middle of that range of movement. Your shins should be resting firmly against the front of your boots, but with the option to push further forwards, or flex backwards, if necessary. Knees: need to be slightly bent. Only if they're bent will you be able to use them for sideways edging movements. But if you bend only your knees, without bending your ankles, you'll end up leaning too far back. Waist: slightly flexed, so that your upper body is inclined forward a little. Back: should be slightly rounded, with the shoulders leaning forward. Many skiers, even quite experienced ones, believe they're somehow skiing \"elegantly\" if they keep their back ramrod stiff and completely upright, like a guardsman, but in fact they're limiting their range of movement. Arms: should be held in front of you, with the hands quite wide apart. They should be nearly straight, with your elbows just slightly flexed. Some instructors will tell you to visualise holding a tray of drinks, others holding a hoop. As long as your hands are where you can see them, just at the bottom of your field of vision, they're in the right place. Too many intermediates ski with \"lazy hands\" dangling by their sides, which means they're unable to use them to help their balance when they really need to. Head: your eyes should be level at all times (this applies through all levels of skiing), and you should be looking a short distance ahead of you, depending on your speed. Never look down at your ski tips. Overall, when in the neutral position, you should resemble a goalkeeper about to face a penalty kick: athletic, and ready to react.",

      "body": "<p>The public lavatories on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne are fitted with floor-to-ceiling turnstiles. In the summer tourist season, when the vast car park on the outskirts of the island's only village is overflowing, the mechanisms revolve so rapidly they could easily be harnessed as an alternative energy source to heat and light the homes of Lindisfarne's 160 full-time residents. </p> <p>Half a million people flock across the three-mile long causeway from mainland Northumberland each year and since Holy Island covers just 1,350 acres, they are not easily absorbed. As with any popular tourist site, it pays to pick your time to visit. </p> <p>Saint Aidan, the Irishman who might be credited with inadvertently starting the rush, arrived in Northumberland in AD635. He chose Lindisfarne as the seat of his new bishopric largely because it reminded him of the Hebridean island of Iona. </p> <p>Come here in the summer - when St Aidan's winery is besieged by coach parties eager to test the reputed aphrodisiacal powers of Lindisfarne mead and the driveway to the small castle on Beblow Crag is doing a passable imitation of Oxford Street - and it's hard to grasp what might have led the Columban monk to such a whimsical conclusion. </p> <p>Iona, after all, is the personification of Celtic asceticism, while Holy Island is, well, a place where the public lavatories are entered as if they were a football stadium. </p> <p>Arrive in autumn, winter or early spring, however, when the climate deters all but the doughtiest, and the impression Lindisfarne creates is altogether different. Come early in the morning when there's frost, or snow, or just a tear-jerking wind whipping in off the North Sea and it's easy to see why the rigorously spiritual Aidan might have been reminded of his former home. </p> <p>Just after Christmas, I crossed to Lindisfarne on the twice-daily bus service from Berwick-on-Tweed, 10 miles up the coast. It was one of those days when the temperature rarely breaks freezing point and exposed skin tightens until your face feels like it's shrink-wrapped. </p> <p>The biscuit-coloured grass along the water's edge was tinged pewter by the frost, and powdered snow swirled out from around the wheels of the bus like a theatrical mist. A skein of Canada geese wheeled above the lough and flocks of speckled drumlins skittered in and out of the sea like paddling children. </p> <p>The causeway crosses the water from Beal and sweeps along the western shore of the island. The sea closes it for around 10 hours a day. Tide tables and warning notices are posted at regular intervals along both approaches. Yet, despite all such efforts, last year 80 visitors still managed to get into trouble on the crossing. Some found shelter in the refuge hut, a clapboard shed on stilts that hovers just above the high-water mark, others needed assistance. The rescue services were called out 15 times in all. Now there is talk of CCTV cameras. </p> <p>The bus from Berwick stops in the village marketplace, next to the mead factory and opposite the ruined priory. In the backyard of a low stone cottage the crab pots are neatly stacked. Northumbrian crab is good, and if you're lucky on Lindisfarne you can find fishermen selling sandwiches filled with it at the front doors of their houses. </p> <p>After his arrival, Aidan quickly established Lindisfarne as the Christian capital of the north, overseeing a region that extended from Edinburgh to the Humber. A monastery was built in the Irish style: hewn oak roofed with a thatch of reeds and surrounded by a defensive wall. Nothing of that structure survives; the ruins, including the impressive rainbow arch, date from Norman times when the austerity of the Columban monks had been superseded by the greater opulence of the Benedictine order. An arch way in nearby church of St Mary is the only bit of Saxon architecture that survives on the island. </p> <p>St Mary's also has the \"petting stone\" or \"louping stool\", a large boulder over which brides leap either for good luck or fertility depending on the sensibilities of the chronicler. The wedding procession on Lindisfarne is also traditionally accompanied by the mass discharging of shotguns. At one time live rounds were fired, but that practice was discontinued a decade or so ago after a nearby hotelier took exception to having his windows shattered. </p> <p>Aidan may have chosen Lindisfarne largely for ascetic reasons, but there were political considerations behind his choice, too. You can see the main one from the Heugh, a grassy bank that rises to the south of St Mary's. Across the waters of Budle Bay stands Bamburgh, once the home of Oswald, first Christian monarch of the Saxon kingdom of Northum bria. The castle that now looms from the clifftop there, dwarfing the nearby village, is a 15th-century creation, but it was built on the site of Oswald's original palace. </p> <p>It was Oswald who invited Aidan to Northumberland in the first place, soon after the warrior king had battered the pagan armies of Cadwallader, close by Hadrian's Wall at Heavenfield. Oswald himself was later sanctified after splinters from the pole on which his head was impaled miraculously cured those who drank from water in which they had fallen. </p> <p>Oswald was by all accounts a kind and generous man, but his main role in the newly-established monastery was as military protector. At Bamburgh he was ideally placed to keep an eye on things. </p> <p>When Aidan died, Cuthbert, the shepherd-saint from nearby Glendale, became Bishop of Lindisfarne. The nature-loving Northumbrian added further to the importance of the island. Five future saints were educated here. When Cuthbert died prematurely, weakened by his adherence to a punishing regime of fasting and self-flagellation, on nearby Great Farne Island in AD687, his body was brought back to the monastery and buried alongside, it is said, the skull of his former protector Oswald. It was in commemoration of Cuthbert that his successor Eadfrith created the monastery's most lasting physical work, the Lindisfarne gospels. </p> <p>A century later the island's position, once a source of security, became its main point of weakness. In AD793, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, \"terrible portents\" of sheet lighting, whirlwinds and \"fiery dragons flying across the sky\" were followed by \"the harrying of heathen men\" who \"miserably destroyed God's church in Lindisfarne through rapine and slaughter\". The Vikings had arrived. </p> <p> On Lindisfarne's north shore, the island still looks much as the Norsemen must have seen it. A three-mile strip of pale sand is flanked by blond, tussocky hillocks and the only sounds are the skeletal rattling of the wind-dried grasses, the rush of the sea and the keening of the lapwings. </p> <p>Along the beach you can still sometimes find St Cuthbert's beads - the fossilised joints of the stone-lily that were once used for rosaries. Or you may come across a basking grey seal; the gelatinous remains of Britain's longest animal, the northern octopus; or a bobbing flock of the eider ducks that were the saint's favourite bird. Look across at the mainland and the contrast is startling. Northumberland is vividly green, Lindisfarne bleached as driftwood. No wonder self-denying Aidan and his followers picked it. </p> <p>After the first Danish attack, the Columban monks hung on for another 100 years. But then, fearing further raids, they fled taking the gospels and the remains of St Cuthbert with them. Cuthbert's body was returned briefly to Lindisfarne for safekeeping during William the Conqueror's brutal suppression of the north, before finding its final resting place in Durham cathedral. </p> <p>The course of the gospels was altogether more wayward. For several centuries they disappeared altogether, turning up in 1623 in the possession of a clerk of the House of Commons. They were later handed over to the British Museum by Sir Robert Cotton, and are now on display in the British Library. </p> <p>And, for the first time in more than 1,000 years, the gospels have returned to Holy Island - albeit in a virtual sense. The new Lindisfarne Heritage Centre in Marygate has an interactive computer display with more than 20 pages. In this case, the phrase \"illuminated manuscript\" is apt in more ways than one. Such is the vividness of the colours in the gospels that the illustrations really do appear to glow with light. The real gospels are actually in Newcastle at the moment, where they are on loan to the Laing Art Gallery until tomorrow. They have survived their circuitous journey remarkably well, particularly since they were reputedly once lost in the Irish Sea and not recovered for four days. </p> <p>Monks eventually returned to Lindisfarne, which they re-named Holy Island, but its importance had been lost. The monastery was dissolved around 1538 and the island devoted itself to more secular matters: fishing, farming and as a base for the English fleets that lay in wait for Spanish ships bound for Leith. </p> <p>The castle that perches 100ft up on the conical rock to the east of the village owes its existence to the Anglo-Scottish conflict, though the modern building which, with its curved walls and funnel-like turrets, has the appearance of a grand ocean liner, owes more to the vision of Sir Edwin Lutyens who re-designed it in 1903 than to Tudor military architects. </p> <p>The tiny castle is so heavily visited these days it seems in danger of subsiding under the weight of numbers. Nowa days it is open for just four-and-a-half hours daily, while the little, walled Gertrude Jekyll-designed garden is open just one day a week. </p> <p>When sinking ships went out of fashion, the islanders took to aiding them. Lindisfarne and the Farnes (from which the lighthouse keeper's daughter, Grace Darling, performed the deeds that made her a Victorian heroine) are surrounded by sand bars and savage rocks. </p> <p>Once two lifeboats operated from the island; a memorial opposite the entrance to the priory records the crews they helped to rescue. Sailors from Stockholm, Archangel, Timmernabben, Rafsoe, Stavanger, Nantes and Scheveningen once swelled the local population as visitors who arrive by car and coach do today. Though not in quite such numbers, thankfully.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The Lindisfarne gospels are on loan to the Laing Art Gallery, New Bridge Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8AG (0191-232 7734) until tomorrow. The gallery is open today from 10am-5pm (because queues are approx 60-90 minutes long, last entrance will be at 3.30pm); and Sunday from 2pm-5pm. Entrance is free. After tomorrow, the gospels will return to the British Library in London where they will go back on display on February 1.

Oswald himself was later sanctified after splinters from the pole on which his head was impaled miraculously cured those who drank from water in which they had fallen. Oswald was by all accounts a kind and generous man, but his main role in the newly-established monastery was as military protector. At Bamburgh he was ideally placed to keep an eye on things. When Aidan died, Cuthbert, the shepherd-saint from nearby Glendale, became Bishop of Lindisfarne. The nature-loving Northumbrian added further to the importance of the island. Five future saints were educated here. When Cuthbert died prematurely, weakened by his adherence to a punishing regime of fasting and self-flagellation, on nearby Great Farne Island in AD687, his body was brought back to the monastery and buried alongside, it is said, the skull of his former protector Oswald. It was in commemoration of Cuthbert that his successor Eadfrith created the monastery's most lasting physical work, the Lindisfarne gospels. A century later the island's position, once a source of security, became its main point of weakness. In AD793, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, \"terrible portents\" of sheet lighting, whirlwinds and \"fiery dragons flying across the sky\" were followed by \"the harrying of heathen men\" who \"miserably destroyed God's church in Lindisfarne through rapine and slaughter\". The Vikings had arrived. On Lindisfarne's north shore, the island still looks much as the Norsemen must have seen it. A three-mile strip of pale sand is flanked by blond, tussocky hillocks and the only sounds are the skeletal rattling of the wind-dried grasses, the rush of the sea and the keening of the lapwings. Along the beach you can still sometimes find St Cuthbert's beads - the fossilised joints of the stone-lily that were once used for rosaries. Or you may come across a basking grey seal; the gelatinous remains of Britain's longest animal, the northern octopus; or a bobbing flock of the eider ducks that were the saint's favourite bird. Look across at the mainland and the contrast is startling. Northumberland is vividly green, Lindisfarne bleached as driftwood. No wonder self-denying Aidan and his followers picked it. After the first Danish attack, the Columban monks hung on for another 100 years. But then, fearing further raids, they fled taking the gospels and the remains of St Cuthbert with them. Cuthbert's body was returned briefly to Lindisfarne for safekeeping during William the Conqueror's brutal suppression of the north, before finding its final resting place in Durham cathedral. The course of the gospels was altogether more wayward. For several centuries they disappeared altogether, turning up in 1623 in the possession of a clerk of the House of Commons. They were later handed over to the British Museum by Sir Robert Cotton, and are now on display in the British Library. And, for the first time in more than 1,000 years, the gospels have returned to Holy Island - albeit in a virtual sense. The new Lindisfarne Heritage Centre in Marygate has an interactive computer display with more than 20 pages. In this case, the phrase \"illuminated manuscript\" is apt in more ways than one. Such is the vividness of the colours in the gospels that the illustrations really do appear to glow with light. The real gospels are actually in Newcastle at the moment, where they are on loan to the Laing Art Gallery until tomorrow. They have survived their circuitous journey remarkably well, particularly since they were reputedly once lost in the Irish Sea and not recovered for four days. Monks eventually returned to Lindisfarne, which they re-named Holy Island, but its importance had been lost. The monastery was dissolved around 1538 and the island devoted itself to more secular matters: fishing, farming and as a base for the English fleets that lay in wait for Spanish ships bound for Leith. The castle that perches 100ft up on the conical rock to the east of the village owes its existence to the Anglo-Scottish conflict, though the modern building which, with its curved walls and funnel-like turrets, has the appearance of a grand ocean liner, owes more to the vision of Sir Edwin Lutyens who re-designed it in 1903 than to Tudor military architects. The tiny castle is so heavily visited these days it seems in danger of subsiding under the weight of numbers. Nowa days it is open for just four-and-a-half hours daily, while the little, walled Gertrude Jekyll-designed garden is open just one day a week. When sinking ships went out of fashion, the islanders took to aiding them. Lindisfarne and the Farnes (from which the lighthouse keeper's daughter, Grace Darling, performed the deeds that made her a Victorian heroine) are surrounded by sand bars and savage rocks. Once two lifeboats operated from the island; a memorial opposite the entrance to the priory records the crews they helped to rescue. Sailors from Stockholm, Archangel, Timmernabben, Rafsoe, Stavanger, Nantes and Scheveningen once swelled the local population as visitors who arrive by car and coach do today. Though not in quite such numbers, thankfully. The practicals The Lindisfarne gospels are on loan to the Laing Art Gallery, New Bridge Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8AG (0191-232 7734) until tomorrow. The gallery is open today from 10am-5pm (because queues are approx 60-90 minutes long, last entrance will be at 3.30pm); and Sunday from 2pm-5pm. Entrance is free. After tomorrow, the gospels will return to the British Library in London where they will go back on display on February 1. The interactive computer exhibit, with more than 20 copied pages, is at Lindisfarne Heritage Centre in Marygate (01289 389004), open every day throughout the year from 10am-4pm, entrance \u00a32 for adults, children free.

The walk is only about two miles long, but involves an ascent of about 300m (1,000ft) over rough moorland and heather, so stout footwear and waterproofs are required. The best map is the Ordnance Survey's 2in to the mile Explorer No 13, The Lleyn Peninsula, East. The nearest sizeable town is Pwllheli on the south coast, where the TIC is at Min-y-don in Station Square (open Monday-Saturday, 10am-4.30pm during the winter, 01758 613000). A recommended pub for a well-earned pint after the walk is The Rivals Inn in Llanaelhaearn (01758 750669), and good B&amp;B accommodation can be found at the Plas yr Eifl hotel (01286 660781) in Trefor, to the north of Llanaelhaearn, just off the A499 Caernarfon road.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The hammock, I am reliably informed, was invented by the Arawak indians who once inhabited the Virgin islands, and in 1783... actually it doesn't matter a fig what happened in 1783 because, when you own a private island, history, geography and just about everything else are whatever you choose to make them. </p> <p>If you like Bali but have got fed up with the journey, the climate or possibly the government, you can, like Richard Branson, create your own Balinese island in the West Indies. And if you want to call one of the buildings Bali Hi and another Bali Lo, no one is going to stop you. </p> <p>Branson first saw Necker in 1979 when, posing as a multi-millionaire, he was given a red carpet tour of available islands by some very upmarket estate agents who installed him at an expensive hotel and flew him around by helicopter. The asking price for Necker was \u00a32m. He offered \u00a3175,000. The red carpet was pulled from under his feet and he had to pay his own fare home. Later, when he really was a multi-millionaire, the island was still hanging on the market, and he was able to buy it in 1981 for the comparatively knock-down price of \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>Not that Necker was anything special as West Indian islands go. About three-quarters of a mile long and half a mile wide with a hill some 100ft high running down the middle, it had two good beaches but no buildings, no fresh water and very few trees. The only previous known residents had been the journalist Andrew Alexander and the photographer Don McCullin who were landed there in 1968 to write an article for the Weekend Telegraph on what it was really like to be marooned on a desert island. And a miserable time they had of it. </p> <p>It is now more comfortable. The houses have been built in traditional Balinese style with no obvious expense spared. The timber and the dark stone for the walls were brought from Brazil, the honey-coloured floor stone from Yorkshire. The statues, furniture and fabrics came from Indonesia. The goats who roamed the island were \"persuaded to leave\". </p> <p>Branson spends three months of the year on Necker, keeping open house for his friends, and he considers it his home. When he isn't there, the island is available to rent to the likes of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, Robert DeNiro, Bryan Ferry, Mike Oldfield, John Hurt, Peter Gabriel, Rosanna Arquette, Oprah Winfrey, Michael J Fox, Mel Gibson, Annie Lennox and George Michael - and you if you have the odd $14,000 a day to spare on a holiday. </p> <p>You arrive at Necker from Tortola at 50 miles an hour in an enormous white speedboat, the kind that the talented Mr Ripley would certainly have envied. A dozen or so staff live on the island, all young, fair-haired and bronzed. The women look like Greta Scacchi circa 1985, and - even stranger - the men are like younger, better-looking versions of Branson himself. The resident staff tend to the guests, teach tennis and sailing and drive the speedboat on sunset cruises. They seem disconcertingly like the Midwitch Cuckoos come of age, but they are more than happy to treat you, me and \"Richard\" as their equals. The cleaning and general maintenance is performed by a further staff of 20 who are brought in for the day from Tortola, but not in the speedboat. </p> <p>The buildings are, by any standards, spectacular. The house on the hill has views of the sea on all sides, and a breeze blows through every room and corridor. Plants grow in the hall, almost a jungle in the main lounge. Most of the bathrooms are open-sided, and you can watch the ocean while standing in the shower or sitting on the lavatory. (The last time I was in a bathroom with a wall missing was in a squat in Clapham, but it wasn't the same - the view only went as far as the tumble-down house next door.) Some of the lavatories are covered in Balinese mosaic, the shower walls built from coral and driftwood. </p> <p>The rest of the island is proving more intractable to Balinisation. Hundreds of trees have been planted as well as cactus and frangipani, but the strong winds, fierce sun and poor soil cause problems, and the shade is insufficient to sustain the ornamental gingers, ferns and orchids that define a Balinese landscape. Most of the colour comes from tecomas, oleander, hibiscus and too much purple bougainvillea. </p> <p>The island is not yet full of sounds and sweet airs - unless you count David Gray and early Bob Dylan - and half way between the quay and the main house a strong smell wafts from what I was told is the \"organic wildlife pond\". When you own a private island, a malfunctioning sewage plant can become an organic wildlife pond any time you want. </p> <p>When they were here, Alexander and McCullin lived on a dismal diet of what few fish they could catch, stale coconut, sea grapes and prickly pears, spending hours trying to remove the fine prickles from their mouths. Sitting at the long dining table on the veranda, I could look down to the beach where they lived, and I often thought of them as I ate quails eggs stuffed with caviar and drank Chateau Lynch-Bages (perhaps a little too young) or the Necker-branded champagne. </p> <p>The food on the island is an elaborate concoction of sculpted vegetables artistically arranged, open ravioli of lobster and fennel, duck and foie gras, chargrilled snapper and tempura prawns, and strange stick-like objects tied up with seaweed which you don't know whether to eat or use as cutlery. Differently-coloured sauces are dripped elegantly around the plate like a painting by Jackson Pollock. It is all rather in the style of Raymond Blanc of whom Private Eye once said: \"Surely this man would eat his own toes if the right recipe occurred to him.\" </p> <p>In the long term, this diet is unlikely to do you any more good than Alexander and McCullin's, although if you wanted something simpler, you would certainly get it. You could even have beans on toast, but it would probably come in a perfect pyramid topped with a sprig of dill. </p> <p> Alexander and McCullin slept on the beach, soaked by the rain and eaten by mosquitoes. McCullin counted 51 bites on the back of one hand, and on the first night, his last words were: \"I do not much like what I see.\" As I lay in my large comfortable bed under the mosquito net, listening to the roar of the surf and watching the intense blue of the Caribbean night sky, the thin white curtains blowing in the breeze, I rather liked what I saw. My last thought on the first night was that a couple of Howard Hodgkins might possibly have brightened up the walls a bit. </p> <p>Alexander and McCullin were desperate with thirst for most of their stay, never able to collect enough rainwater. Had they been here now, they would only have had to stroll a few yards through the bushes to find an open-sided pagoda where there would have been an ample supply of clean towels, sun-tan oil (factors nought to infinity), snorkelling gear and a fridge full of cold water, cans of beer and bottles of champagne. </p> <p>They had probably intended to stay for months, but after a fortnight they gave up, each having lost about two stone. Were they staying here now, a fortnight's stay would set them back $196,000 - an awful lot of money for a holiday, but the island is booked up far in advance and many guests come back regularly. Necker can house 26 visitors, which cuts down the cost per head, although hardly to a bargain price. Often, couples rent the island just for themselves, moving from room to room as the fancy takes them. </p> <p>Unlike a hotel, none of the rooms have keys, nor do they need them. You can eat and drink what you want, whenever you want, and do pretty much as you please, without any fear of running into strangers or paparazzi, not that I've ever found paparazzi to be a problem. </p> <p>If you can't face the 200-yard walk from the beach to the house, a phone is always near at hand for you to call a car. If you find the sea just a little bit too warm, the temperature in one of the nearby pools is kept a few degrees colder. When bored with tennis, snooker, backgammon, chess, sailing, snorkelling, windsurfing and the inflatable banana, you can visit the nearby love temple for a quiet bonk (or even a noisy one). It consists of a very large bed on stilts. </p> <p>But there are limits to the luxury. The staff talked proudly of how, at the last minute, they had been able to \"source\" a bottle of Chateau Haut-Brion 1978 for an earlier guest, but sadly my request for Iranian Sultanie vodka went unanswered. </p> <p>It is an absurd life, one far removed from the problems of commuting on a Virgin train, but one you get used to absurdly easily, and you find yourself frowning when you notice that one of yesterday's champagne corks has not yet been removed from the beach.</p> <p><strong>And here are some that won't cost - or deliver - as much...</strong></p> <p>Private islands are not for everyone. An English couple who bought an island off the west coast of Scotland spent their evenings gazing wistfully at the lights on the mainland. Most mornings the husband would say: \"I'm just going out in the boat,\" and he would head off to spend his lunchtimes in one of the dreariest pubs in the Highlands.</p> <p>They, like most people, suffered from the delusion that there is a great party going on somewhere nearby and they haven't been invited. Successful owners of private islands are very different. They believe that any party they haven't been invited to isn't worth going to. That, too, is a delusion.</p> <p>They are also, for the most part, barking mad. Typical owners include:</p> <p><strong>Dr Moreau</strong> who sought total privacy in the South Seas to conduct his beastly genetic experiments. <br><strong>Hospitality rating:</strong> 0/10.</p> <p><strong>Dr No</strong> who sought total privacy in the West Indies to plot world domination. <br><strong>Hospitality rating:</strong> 0/10.</p> <p><strong>Calypso and Circe</strong> in the Odyssey, who welcomed strangers to their alder-fringed islands in the Mediterranean, so long as they didn't make any plans to leave. <br><strong>Hospitality rating:</strong> 5/10.</p> <p><strong>Lord Summerisle</strong> in The Wicker Man.

Your daughter should be able to negotiate such an invitation from her university. Accommodation may be a problem in a city such as Moscow. Foreigners inevitably pay higher prices than Russians everywhere - hotels, trains etc. but compared with costs in the UK they are low. Your invitation should cover your wish to visit Petersburg in addition to visiting Moscow, as travel is limited to what is stated on the visa. You need to be aware that my wife, despite having an invitation obtained while I was in Russia, was refused a visa, apparently on the grounds that it was not an official visa, stamped by a government body. <br><strong>Richard Ehlers</strong></p> <p>\u0095 My son spent some time this year in Samara (a city on the Volga) as a language assistant and I visited him at Easter. As he had a flat there I only wanted flights organised. I had to arrange my own visa, which was very complicated as I needed a letter from an official organisation inviting me to Samara, which only arrived two days before I was due to travel. I used a company in Croydon called Interchange (020-8681 3612) who were very efficient, helpful and cheap. They would probably be able to arrange a package for you and if they book hotel accommodation, they will also be able to sort out you visas. They deal with the Russian consulate in Edinburgh. It is almost impossible to get through to the one in London. <br><strong>Norma Cook</strong></p> <p>\u0095 It is very difficult to get a Russian visa without a hotel booking. However specialist tour operators to Russia can make individual arrangements at a wide range of hotels, which secures a visa automatically. It would be a pity though to limit travel just to Moscow and St Petersburg. Take the opportunity of staying in towns along the Golden Ring such as Suzdal and Yaroslavl. For mid-range hotels in Moscow, allow about \u00a350 a night for a twin, and in St Petersburg about \u00a360. Prices are lower elsewhere. At Easter an airfare into Moscow and out of St Petersburg should be around \u00a3300. <br><strong>Neil Taylor, Regent Holidays, Bristol</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I suggest you contact Intourist and ask for information as an independent traveller. Intourist have offices in Manchester (who have always provided me with good service and advice) and London. The company can book hotels, flights, travel within Russia and arrange visas all at a reasonable price. An opportunity to visit St Petersburg should not be missed: I have found the Moskva hotel to be good value when on special offer, and only two metro stops from the centre of Nevsky Prospekt. The Pulkovskaya is also good value, but some distance from the centre. The Astoria has particular grandeur, style and location but is more expensive. The Europa is probably the most luxurious, but with business client prices to match. <br><strong>Malcolm Hill</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Russian bureaucracy is over-rated. I've had seven visas in the past three years, and each one's been a cliff-hanger. Intourist has a visa service: you pay a premium, bit it's worth it. Moscow isn't a hot destination, but you can still get cheap fares if you ask around. Aeroflot hasn't too many fans, but it's my airline of choice. The planes might be improvised, but the pilots all graduated from the Biggles School of Flying, aka the Soviet Air Force. Stay at the Mir, opposite the White House and the US Embassy; it's the former Comecon building. The foyer is deceptively imposing.

      "body": "<p>Most of us, at one time or other, have had one of those fridges with a freezer compartment that resembles the polar ice cap. Usually, the fridge ends up in a skip and its owner buys one that works. David Thody, however, has lived with just such a clapped-out fridge for the best part of 12 years. </p> <p>David - or Doc, as he is known to his friends, on account of him being the first person at his school to wear Dr Martens boots - simply got around his ice-bound freezer box by ignoring it. In fact, he is possibly the only 37-year-old in the country who has never bought anything from the freezer section of a supermarket. Not even a fish finger. </p> <p>By late last year, his girlfriend, Sophie, had had enough. The fridge was going, she said. As was the oven with a door that had to be wedged shut with a brick. And the rest of the kitchen, while they were at it. It was time to have a proper, grown-up cooking space in which everything did what it was meant to. </p> <p>\"It was beyond embarrassing,\" Doc tells Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, in his Brixton flat while Imogen, her assistant for the day, unpacks the ingredients for the KD's latest mercy mission. \"Not least because I design shops, restaurants and exhibition spaces for a living.\" </p> <p>So, new kitchen equalled problem solved - or so Doc thought, until he went to Tesco. \"I suddenly realised I was a freezer-aisle virgin. I spent ages in the frozen-food section, but didn't have a clue what to buy. My first reaction was, 'Hey, there's lots of food here that's really quick to cook.' Then I realised that I didn't know what to do with any of it. So I bought loads of ice cream and came home.\" </p> <p>\"That's why I'm here,\" says Rosie. \"Next time, you'll have no problem.\" </p> <p>\"I wouldn't bank on it,\" says Doc. \"I don't cook much at the best of times, though that's because I had such a rubbish kitchen.\" </p> <p>Rosie tuts, then explains her plan. \"The idea is to show you how to rustle up good meals from stuff you can buy frozen, and also a couple of things to make in bulk and freeze. Mind you, I got over-excited at the supermarket. Like you, I'm not used to buying frozen food, and got carried away with the novelty of it all.\" </p> <p>Doc perks up, pleased that so accomplished a cook is a kindred spirit, at least where frozen food is concerned. \"So, what's first?\" </p> <p>\"Pea soup. You'll have it for lunch while I get on with the other dishes.\" </p> <p>\"Anything you want me to do?\" </p> <p>\"You could wash the fresh veg for this and the other dishes...\" </p> <p>\"Oh,\" says Doc, miffed that this means he won't get to play with Rosie's collection of very big, very sharp knives. Instead, he finds himself by the sink, up to his elbows in water and vegetables, while Imogen chops onions, celery and bacon for the soup, and then moves on to the veg so heroically cleaned by Doc. </p> <p>Rosie sets a big pot on the stove and in what seems like next to no time the soup is cooked, blended and passed through a sieve. \"Only because that's what I'd do in a restaurant,\" she explains. \"It makes it much smoother. But it tastes fine without.\" The end result, finished off with a drizzle of truffle oil (\"Very expensive,\" says Rosie, \"but you need only the barest whiff\") and Parmesan shavings, does indeed taste fine, to judge from the way Doc smears up every last drop with a hunk of bread offered by Rosie. \"By the way,\" he says, \"this bread is wonderful. I didn't even see how you made it.\" </p> <p>\"That's because I bought it,\" says Rosie, who has already turned her mind to the Asian-style pancakes. \"These are a cinch. All the veg is ready cut and frozen, as are the prawns, so it's just a matter of defrosting what you need and bunging it in a wok. And the broth that goes with it you can make in advance and freeze. The only real cooking is steaming the rolls once they're filled, and that's not hard, is it?\" </p> <p>Doc has to agree: \"This cooking lark doesn't seem like such a chore, after all.\" And so it proves, as Rosie takes him through the construction of the pancakes and the making of the clean-flavoured fish broth. </p> <p>While Doc enjoys a taste of their labours - \"It's really light. Mind you, that's just as well if I'm going to have room to try everything\" - Imogen gets to work on the lamb meatballs and Rosie finishes off a rabbit, chilli and chocolate affair, the very thought of which \"scares me\", admits Doc. \"Don't worry,\" says Imogen confidently. \"It might seem strange, but it works brilliantly. Anyway, before it's ready to taste, I really think you ought to help me out with these meatballs, so you know what's what.\" </p> <p>Doc complies, although his first gnarled effort looks like the poor relation of Imogen's immaculate little creations. \"Oh dear,\" says Doc. \"It's a bit of a runt, isn't it?\" </p> <p>\"Er, yes, it is,\" says Imogen, brandishing the offending object for Rosie's perusal. \"If any break up while you're poaching them, don't blame me,\" she tells the KD. </p> <p>Doc looks suitably chastened, and then frightened, for Rosie approaches him with a bowl of the rabbit. He gingerly takes a spoonful. \"That is really weird,\" he says. \"You can smell the chocolate a mile off, and the first taste is unmistakably chocolate, but then the other flavours come through and you don't notice any more. In fact, I'd eat that again.\" </p> <p>\"Just as well,\" says Rosie, looking at the full pot on the stove. </p> <p>\"Oh, that's all right,\" says Doc. \"We'll have the rest for dinner tonight, when Sophie gets home from work. So long as I can fit anything else in, that is.\" </p> <p>Rosie grins, well-pleased with his response to her efforts, and starts on a chickpea and tomato sauce for the meatballs. \"I'll tell you another good thing to do with chickpeas,\" she says absent-mindedly. \"Toss them in cornflour and spices - cumin, paprika, stuff like that - then fry them. They go all tempura-y. Really simple, and they taste fabulous.\" </p> <p>No sooner has she finished speaking than the sauce is ready, the meatballs are laid on top, and Doc is required, once again, to don his chief taster's hat. \"Oh God, that's a big plateful,\" he says. \"I've still got pudding to try, you know.\" Then he tastes it, the complaints stop and he stays silent until the plate is empty. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Rosie constructs an apple and raspberry filo pie and pops it in the oven. Twenty minutes later, it emerges, but Doc has had enough by now: \"I can only manage a spoonful,\" he sighs, surveying his kitchen and all the finished dishes laid out in containers. \"There's still so much left. We'll never eat it all before it goes off.\" </p> <p>Rosie smiles knowingly, then says, \"Well, you could always try freezing some of it.\" </p> <p> All recipes serve four. </p> <p><strong> Pea soup</strong></p> <p>Frozen peas are just the best - this soup is fast and delicious, the perfect winter warmer. And if you wanted to serve it in summer, just add some mint and have it cold with a dollop of cr\u00e8me frache, in which case you should pass the soup through a sieve, so that it is smooth. Once cooked, it should keep for a day or two in the fridge. </p> <p><strong> 2 medium onions, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>2 sticks celery, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 leek, white part only, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>4 cloves garlic </strong><br> <strong>175g smoked bacon, chopped </strong><br> <strong>400g frozen peas </strong><br> <strong>40g butter </strong><br> <strong>tbsp oil </strong><br> <strong>55g fresh Parmesan, grated </strong><br> <strong>Truffle oil (optional) </strong><br> <strong>Salt and pepper</strong> </p> <p>In a heavy-based pan, heat the oil and then fry the bacon for a couple of minutes until it begins to render its fat. Add the onion, garlic, celery and leek, cover, and sweat down for about 15 minutes, until softened. Add the butter and, once it has melted, the peas. Stir for a minute until all the peas are coated, then pour in enough water to come about 3cm above the contents of the pan. </p> <p>Simmer gently until the peas are completely soft. Put into a liquidiser (you may need to do this in batches), and whizz until quite smooth. Add water if it seems too thick. If the resulting soup is not quite smooth enough for your taste, push it through a sieve. To serve, reheat the soup, pour into a bowl and scatter Parmesan shavings on top and, if you are feeling saucy, a drizzle of truffle oil. </p> <p><strong> Prawn rolls and fish broth</strong></p> <p> The idea here is to minimise the time you have to spend chopping by taking advantage of all that ready-sliced veg in the freezer aisle. Also, spring roll wrappers usually come vacuum-packed, so will keep for an age in the cupboard. Make lots of the broth and freeze it until next time. In short, the perfect quick weekday meal. </p> <p><strong> 55g frozen sliced mixed peppers </strong><br> <strong>55g frozen sliced mushrooms, cut in half </strong><br> <strong>55g frozen baby sweetcorn </strong><br> <strong>1 small tin water chestnuts </strong><br> <strong>200g frozen peeled tiger prawns, slit in half lengthways </strong><br> <strong>200g frozen white fish fillet (preferably not cod) </strong><br> <strong>20g fresh ginger, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks, skin and any trimmings reserved </strong><br> <strong>2 stalks lemongrass, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>55ml Amontillado sherry </strong><br> <strong>1 tsp fish sauce </strong><br> <strong>1 big bunch fresh coriander, with roots, if possible </strong><br> <strong>2 tbsp fresh mint </strong><br> <strong>1 medium onion, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>5 cloves garlic </strong><br> <strong>6 spring onions, trimmed, sliced into matchsticks, trimmings and most of green part reserved </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp dark soy sauce </strong><br> <strong>Any leek, carrot or celery you may have lying around, roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp sesame oil </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp sunflower oil </strong><br> <strong>8 spring roll wrappers, or rice pancakes</strong> </p> <p>Place the fish fillets and all the vegetable and herb trimmings, peelings, roots and stalks in a pan. Pour in the sherry and fish sauce, then cover with water. Bring to a boil, skim off any scum that rises to the surface, and simmer very gently while you prepare everything else. </p> <p>Heat the oil in a wok and, when it is smoking, throw in the peppers, mushrooms, sweetcorn and onion. Toss these around until they begin to soften, then add the ginger, spring onions, water chestnuts, prawns and garlic. Move around for a couple more minutes, allowing any liquid in the wok to evaporate, then season to taste and turn out on to a plate. Leave to cool. </p> <p>Soak a clean teatowel under the cold water tap, then squeeze it out and lay it flat on the work surface. Place a couple of the spring roll wrappers or rice pancakes on one half of the teatowel, then fold over the other to cover. Press down gently, and leave for about a minute, until the wrappers are pliable. Place a small mound of the prawn/vegetable filling in the middle of each roll, add a mint leaf and a sprig of coriander, then fold in the two sides and roll up lengthways to form a small see-through package. Place the prepared rolls seam-side down on a plate, and when they are all done, refrigerate until you are ready to dish up. </p> <p>To serve, strain the stock into a clean pan, bring back to the boil and stir in a large handful of coriander leaves. Steam the rolls in a lidded colander over the broth until cooked through, about five minutes. Add soy sauce to the broth, and taste. Season according to taste, then pour a little into a shallow bowl. Serve the rolls in the broth or on the side. </p> <p><strong> Rabbit with chilli and chocolate, and herbed potatoes</strong></p> <p> This Mexican inspired dish makes a good, quick supper, if a little unusual. </p> <p><strong> 250g frozen boneless rabbit pieces </strong><br> <strong>30g bacon, finely diced </strong><br> <strong>1 large red onion, finely sliced </strong><br> <strong>3 sticks of celery, finely sliced </strong><br> <strong>3 small red chillies, finely chopped </strong><br> <strong>400g tin chopped tomatoes </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp cornflour </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp sunflower oil </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar </strong><br> <strong>40g very dark chocolate </strong><br> <strong>A pinch each of paprika and cinnamon </strong><br> <strong>Salt and pepper</strong> </p> <p>For the potatoes </p> <p><strong> 6 medium potatoes, scrubbed and chopped into quarters </strong><br> <strong>2 spring onions, finely chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 large tbsp coriander, finely chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 large tbsp mint, finely chopped </strong><br> <strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong> </p> <p>Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan. Mix the spices into the cornflour and season. Toss the rabbit in this mixture, then brown it all over in the hot oil. Lift out with a slotted spoon. Add the bacon, onion, celery and chilli, and sweat until softened, about 10 minutes or so. Deglaze the pan with the vinegar, then add the tomatoes. Bring up to a simmer and return the meat to the pot. Season as necessary, then add up to 100ml of water if it is looking as though it may dry out. Cover, then cook at a gentle bubble while you make the potatoes. </p> <p>Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, then drain and return to the pan. Add the oil, herbs and spring onions, season generously and gently stir until they are well coated. When the spuds are nearly ready, take the lid off the rabbit pot - if the sauce seems thin, raise the heat and reduce slightly - and add the chocolate. Stir it in until it is completely melted. A salad would be a nice accompaniment.</p> <p><strong> Lamb meatballs with chickpea and tomato sauce</strong></p> <p> This is the other side of freezer food - that is, making something in a big batch, freezing it and then pulling out as much or as little as you need to whip up a little food storm. </p> <p><strong> 8 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp finely chopped dill </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp finely chopped mint </strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp finely chopped parsley </strong><br> <strong>450g minced lamb </strong><br> <strong>Salt and pepper </strong><br> <strong>100g uncooked rice </strong><br> <strong>400g chickpeas </strong><br> <strong>3 beef tomatoes, peeled and roughly chopped </strong><br> <strong>red pepper, chopped </strong><br> <strong>1 red onion, chopped </strong><br> <strong>2 cloves garlic, chopped </strong><br> <strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong> </p> <p>In a bowl, combine the meat, spring onion, herbs (save a teaspoon of mint and parsley), rice and seasonings. Shape the mixture into walnut-sized balls, and leave to rest in the fridge while you bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Carefully add the meatballs, and poach them very gently for 25 minutes. Lift them out of the water with a slotted spoon, and set to one side. Reserve 100ml of the cooking liquor. Allow the meatballs to cool, then freeze them, if you are not planning to eat them later. </p> <p>To reheat them, put 1 tablespoons of oil in a pan, add the chickpeas and saut\u00e9 until they are slightly crispy. Add the onion, red pepper and garlic, then tip in the tomatoes and stir. If the mixture is very dry, add some of the reserved cooking liquor. Gently place the meatballs on top, put a lid on the pan and let the meatballs steam for about five minutes. Lift them out with a slotted spoon, then stir the reserved herbs into the chickpea mixture. Serve the meatballs on top of the chickpeas.</p> <p><strong> Apple and raspberry filo pie</strong></p> <p> Filo is so versatile and easy to use.

      "bodyText": "Most of us, at one time or other, have had one of those fridges with a freezer compartment that resembles the polar ice cap. Usually, the fridge ends up in a skip and its owner buys one that works. David Thody, however, has lived with just such a clapped-out fridge for the best part of 12 years. David - or Doc, as he is known to his friends, on account of him being the first person at his school to wear Dr Martens boots - simply got around his ice-bound freezer box by ignoring it. In fact, he is possibly the only 37-year-old in the country who has never bought anything from the freezer section of a supermarket. Not even a fish finger. By late last year, his girlfriend, Sophie, had had enough. The fridge was going, she said. As was the oven with a door that had to be wedged shut with a brick. And the rest of the kitchen, while they were at it. It was time to have a proper, grown-up cooking space in which everything did what it was meant to. \"It was beyond embarrassing,\" Doc tells Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, in his Brixton flat while Imogen, her assistant for the day, unpacks the ingredients for the KD's latest mercy mission. \"Not least because I design shops, restaurants and exhibition spaces for a living.\" So, new kitchen equalled problem solved - or so Doc thought, until he went to Tesco. \"I suddenly realised I was a freezer-aisle virgin. I spent ages in the frozen-food section, but didn't have a clue what to buy. My first reaction was, 'Hey, there's lots of food here that's really quick to cook.' Then I realised that I didn't know what to do with any of it. So I bought loads of ice cream and came home.\" \"That's why I'm here,\" says Rosie. \"Next time, you'll have no problem.\" \"I wouldn't bank on it,\" says Doc. \"I don't cook much at the best of times, though that's because I had such a rubbish kitchen.\" Rosie tuts, then explains her plan. \"The idea is to show you how to rustle up good meals from stuff you can buy frozen, and also a couple of things to make in bulk and freeze. Mind you, I got over-excited at the supermarket. Like you, I'm not used to buying frozen food, and got carried away with the novelty of it all.\" Doc perks up, pleased that so accomplished a cook is a kindred spirit, at least where frozen food is concerned. \"So, what's first?\" \"Pea soup. You'll have it for lunch while I get on with the other dishes.\" \"Anything you want me to do?\" \"You could wash the fresh veg for this and the other dishes...\" \"Oh,\" says Doc, miffed that this means he won't get to play with Rosie's collection of very big, very sharp knives. Instead, he finds himself by the sink, up to his elbows in water and vegetables, while Imogen chops onions, celery and bacon for the soup, and then moves on to the veg so heroically cleaned by Doc. Rosie sets a big pot on the stove and in what seems like next to no time the soup is cooked, blended and passed through a sieve. \"Only because that's what I'd do in a restaurant,\" she explains. \"It makes it much smoother. But it tastes fine without.\" The end result, finished off with a drizzle of truffle oil (\"Very expensive,\" says Rosie, \"but you need only the barest whiff\") and Parmesan shavings, does indeed taste fine, to judge from the way Doc smears up every last drop with a hunk of bread offered by Rosie. \"By the way,\" he says, \"this bread is wonderful. I didn't even see how you made it.\" \"That's because I bought it,\" says Rosie, who has already turned her mind to the Asian-style pancakes. \"These are a cinch. All the veg is ready cut and frozen, as are the prawns, so it's just a matter of defrosting what you need and bunging it in a wok. And the broth that goes with it you can make in advance and freeze. The only real cooking is steaming the rolls once they're filled, and that's not hard, is it?\" Doc has to agree: \"This cooking lark doesn't seem like such a chore, after all.\" And so it proves, as Rosie takes him through the construction of the pancakes and the making of the clean-flavoured fish broth. While Doc enjoys a taste of their labours - \"It's really light. Mind you, that's just as well if I'm going to have room to try everything\" - Imogen gets to work on the lamb meatballs and Rosie finishes off a rabbit, chilli and chocolate affair, the very thought of which \"scares me\", admits Doc. \"Don't worry,\" says Imogen confidently. \"It might seem strange, but it works brilliantly. Anyway, before it's ready to taste, I really think you ought to help me out with these meatballs, so you know what's what.\" Doc complies, although his first gnarled effort looks like the poor relation of Imogen's immaculate little creations. \"Oh dear,\" says Doc. \"It's a bit of a runt, isn't it?\" \"Er, yes, it is,\" says Imogen, brandishing the offending object for Rosie's perusal. \"If any break up while you're poaching them, don't blame me,\" she tells the KD. Doc looks suitably chastened, and then frightened, for Rosie approaches him with a bowl of the rabbit. He gingerly takes a spoonful. \"That is really weird,\" he says. \"You can smell the chocolate a mile off, and the first taste is unmistakably chocolate, but then the other flavours come through and you don't notice any more. In fact, I'd eat that again.\" \"Just as well,\" says Rosie, looking at the full pot on the stove. \"Oh, that's all right,\" says Doc. \"We'll have the rest for dinner tonight, when Sophie gets home from work. So long as I can fit anything else in, that is.\" Rosie grins, well-pleased with his response to her efforts, and starts on a chickpea and tomato sauce for the meatballs. \"I'll tell you another good thing to do with chickpeas,\" she says absent-mindedly. \"Toss them in cornflour and spices - cumin, paprika, stuff like that - then fry them.

      "byline": "Alex Hamilton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>How do publishers see bestsellers? As tanks behind which the poor infantry can dash in, or as queen bees to which the whole hive is dedicated? Simon Master, MD of Random House, takes the bees option. \"A much smaller publisher with only the odd chance of something big might want a tank for access. But we don't need a bag opener.\" Ursula Mackenzie, publisher at Little, Brown, accepts both. \"Certain books, like Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman, with strong title, promotable author, great concept, will drive all the trade promotions. Others, like Anita Shreve, are more queen bees - nurtured and pushed along.\" Helen Fraser, MD of the general division at Penguin, compares a bestseller to \"a balloon, into which everybody has to be constantly pumping hot air to get lift-off\". </p> <p>But none of these metaphors would quite do for the Harry Potter phenomenon, which has been more like an avalanche carrying everything in its path. It is said now (in Time's Christmas issue) to have sold 74m worldwide. In Britain the hardcover of HP4 seems to have outdone the paperback of HP3, with sales of 978,993. Apparently feeling the strain, Bloomsbury said: \"We can't give you all the details until March when we tell the City. It's very share-sensitive.\" So that's something else a bestseller can be: a dart aimed at the FTSE. And how did I get the figures shown in italics? Magic, of course. Actually the export total is my estimate, based on the 15% performance of HP2 in 1999. </p> <p>Whatever image you choose, everyone in the balloon business declares that a large publishing firm can't live without a bestseller, and the ideal is to have several. Adrian Bourne, MD of the general division of HarperCollins, recalls that when they had the management consultants in, \"We were told to publish only bestsellers. 'Oh, thanks very much,' we said.\" Consultants would doubtless focus on items that \"drive the market\". Last year, many of the hardcover drivers were celebrities, famous for singing, dancing, cooking and passing footballs relentlessly into the goalmouth. Barbara Windsor, an Asda natural, reached 125,000; Martine McCutcheon and Ronan Keating passed 150,000; David Beckham reached 275,000. </p> <p>In the home market the nation's culinary heartthrob Jamie Oliver whacked out 1,346,972 hardcover copies of Return of the Naked Chef , plus 171,000 export. Michael Joseph also has the pond-weeder's pin-up, Charlie Dimmock, on 126,983 for Enjoy Your Garden. But it's not all cooking and digging. A late surge for The History of Britain Vol I by the dynamic Simon Schama (BBC Worldwide) took it to 137,000, while Philip Pullman reached 112,204 with the final volume of his resonant trilogy for children, His Dark Materials (Scholastic). </p> <p>Brand-name fiction also displays impressive hardcover results. Jeffrey Archer's stories sold enough to make the angels weep: 187,930. With what may be his last book, Dick Francis, who's been in these fastseller lists with racing thrillers every year since they began in 1980, shows 268,642 for Shattered. Techno-thriller veteran Tom Clancy has 368,855 for The Bear and the Dragon, Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarlatta thriller nears 350,000, and John Grisham has a UK sale of 308,303 for The Brethren and remains ahead of international Potter, with 100m plus. Many people class travel as para-fiction, so I include here Bill Bryson's Down Under, with 407,000. The Guardian 's \"must-read of the year\", Zadie Smith's first novel White Teeth, was read by more than 30,000 buyers. </p> <p>With substantial discounting, the numbers sold of lead titles, both hard- and soft-cover, have much increased. \"Discounting exists to fund the squabbles of retailers fighting for market share,\" says Malcolm Edwards, MD of hardcovers at Orion. \"It must stop!\" Master exclaims. \"They're cutting nobody's throats but their own.\" Few publishers would dissent. Amanda Ridout, Headline MD, explains the deadly spiral. \"On mass-market paperbacks the pressure comes from Asda, who want to be the lowest. That in turn gets the other supermarkets going, which gets Smith's going, which gets Waterstone's going. When that gets back to Asda ... nightmare scenario!\" David Young, CEO of Little, Brown, says: \"The margins for all our businesses are very fine. A lot of salespeople think that when they give away 1% they give away 1%, but in fact what they're giving away is 25% of the profit margin.\" </p> <p>Fraser regretted the \"enormous amount\" of three-for-two offers. Apart from the third book being marked \"sold at 0.001p\", it delays the reader's next visit. \"A lot of us worry about that. And club introductory offers block up people's reading for months.\" \"What puzzles us,\" said Patrick Janson-Smith of Transworld, \"is why booksellers have no mechanism to drive people right into the store, instead of stopping them just inside the door with all the bargains.\" </p> <p>Hodder MD Martin Neild feels that certain kinds of book are disdained by \"inexperienced but confident gatekeepers\" - youths who buy for the chains. \"Selling in trad storytelling to the trade, and historical fiction, for example, is a pain.\" Ridout has long supported historical fiction, which may now be coming out of the doldrums. Hodder emerged from a ferocious auction clutching Kydd, Julian Stockwin's start on a series of tales of a lower-deck figure in the Napoleonic war. The outstanding model is the late Patrick O'Brian's Napoleonic saga, now totalling 2.1m copies with HarperCollins. </p> <p>Elsewhere, in the chick-lit and city-girl zone, where Penguin have a 100% success rate, publishers complain of manuscript overdose. \"We need fewer 'city girls' and more Trollopes,\" says Edwards. Even Penguin agrees. \"The older woman has been under-catered to,\" Fraser says. \"We're actively searching.\" But the city-girl sorority is also maturing: time to move on, as Jane Green signals with her next book, Babyville. </p> <p>Sporting books spread like a pitch invasion. And Ben Elton led what could be an unremarked genre: novels by comedians, such as Stephen Fry, David Baddiel and Jenny Eclair. Yesteryear's Bridget Jones's Diary climbed to 1.8m, and the film of The Beach added 385,485 to the 858,235 already sold. Mind/body/spirit, a portmanteau concept, continued to burgeon, raising Conversations with God to 150,000. Some oldies recovered from slumps, notably Wilbur Smith, through turning the clock back on his price to 1987. \u00a33.99 was a challenge to discounters but Asda managed, while Waterstone's complained: \"People won't know it's his new one!\" Another perennial, Stephen King, offered a novel serially on the internet, but gave up when the response was more clicks than dollars.

      "bodyText": "How do publishers see bestsellers? As tanks behind which the poor infantry can dash in, or as queen bees to which the whole hive is dedicated? Simon Master, MD of Random House, takes the bees option. \"A much smaller publisher with only the odd chance of something big might want a tank for access. But we don't need a bag opener.\" Ursula Mackenzie, publisher at Little, Brown, accepts both. \"Certain books, like Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman, with strong title, promotable author, great concept, will drive all the trade promotions. Others, like Anita Shreve, are more queen bees - nurtured and pushed along.\" Helen Fraser, MD of the general division at Penguin, compares a bestseller to \"a balloon, into which everybody has to be constantly pumping hot air to get lift-off\". But none of these metaphors would quite do for the Harry Potter phenomenon, which has been more like an avalanche carrying everything in its path. It is said now (in Time's Christmas issue) to have sold 74m worldwide. In Britain the hardcover of HP4 seems to have outdone the paperback of HP3, with sales of 978,993. Apparently feeling the strain, Bloomsbury said: \"We can't give you all the details until March when we tell the City. It's very share-sensitive.\" So that's something else a bestseller can be: a dart aimed at the FTSE. And how did I get the figures shown in italics? Magic, of course. Actually the export total is my estimate, based on the 15% performance of HP2 in 1999. Whatever image you choose, everyone in the balloon business declares that a large publishing firm can't live without a bestseller, and the ideal is to have several. Adrian Bourne, MD of the general division of HarperCollins, recalls that when they had the management consultants in, \"We were told to publish only bestsellers. 'Oh, thanks very much,' we said.\" Consultants would doubtless focus on items that \"drive the market\". Last year, many of the hardcover drivers were celebrities, famous for singing, dancing, cooking and passing footballs relentlessly into the goalmouth. Barbara Windsor, an Asda natural, reached 125,000; Martine McCutcheon and Ronan Keating passed 150,000; David Beckham reached 275,000. In the home market the nation's culinary heartthrob Jamie Oliver whacked out 1,346,972 hardcover copies of Return of the Naked Chef , plus 171,000 export. Michael Joseph also has the pond-weeder's pin-up, Charlie Dimmock, on 126,983 for Enjoy Your Garden. But it's not all cooking and digging. A late surge for The History of Britain Vol I by the dynamic Simon Schama (BBC Worldwide) took it to 137,000, while Philip Pullman reached 112,204 with the final volume of his resonant trilogy for children, His Dark Materials (Scholastic). Brand-name fiction also displays impressive hardcover results. Jeffrey Archer's stories sold enough to make the angels weep: 187,930. With what may be his last book, Dick Francis, who's been in these fastseller lists with racing thrillers every year since they began in 1980, shows 268,642 for Shattered. Techno-thriller veteran Tom Clancy has 368,855 for The Bear and the Dragon, Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarlatta thriller nears 350,000, and John Grisham has a UK sale of 308,303 for The Brethren and remains ahead of international Potter, with 100m plus. Many people class travel as para-fiction, so I include here Bill Bryson's Down Under, with 407,000. The Guardian 's \"must-read of the year\", Zadie Smith's first novel White Teeth, was read by more than 30,000 buyers. With substantial discounting, the numbers sold of lead titles, both hard- and soft-cover, have much increased. \"Discounting exists to fund the squabbles of retailers fighting for market share,\" says Malcolm Edwards, MD of hardcovers at Orion. \"It must stop!\" Master exclaims. \"They're cutting nobody's throats but their own.\" Few publishers would dissent. Amanda Ridout, Headline MD, explains the deadly spiral. \"On mass-market paperbacks the pressure comes from Asda, who want to be the lowest. That in turn gets the other supermarkets going, which gets Smith's going, which gets Waterstone's going. When that gets back to Asda ... nightmare scenario!\" David Young, CEO of Little, Brown, says: \"The margins for all our businesses are very fine. A lot of salespeople think that when they give away 1% they give away 1%, but in fact what they're giving away is 25% of the profit margin.\" Fraser regretted the \"enormous amount\" of three-for-two offers. Apart from the third book being marked \"sold at 0.001p\", it delays the reader's next visit. \"A lot of us worry about that. And club introductory offers block up people's reading for months.\" \"What puzzles us,\" said Patrick Janson-Smith of Transworld, \"is why booksellers have no mechanism to drive people right into the store, instead of stopping them just inside the door with all the bargains.\" Hodder MD Martin Neild feels that certain kinds of book are disdained by \"inexperienced but confident gatekeepers\" - youths who buy for the chains. \"Selling in trad storytelling to the trade, and historical fiction, for example, is a pain.\" Ridout has long supported historical fiction, which may now be coming out of the doldrums. Hodder emerged from a ferocious auction clutching Kydd, Julian Stockwin's start on a series of tales of a lower-deck figure in the Napoleonic war. The outstanding model is the late Patrick O'Brian's Napoleonic saga, now totalling 2.1m copies with HarperCollins. Elsewhere, in the chick-lit and city-girl zone, where Penguin have a 100% success rate, publishers complain of manuscript overdose. \"We need fewer 'city girls' and more Trollopes,\" says Edwards. Even Penguin agrees. \"The older woman has been under-catered to,\" Fraser says. \"We're actively searching.\" But the city-girl sorority is also maturing: time to move on, as Jane Green signals with her next book, Babyville. Sporting books spread like a pitch invasion. And Ben Elton led what could be an unremarked genre: novels by comedians, such as Stephen Fry, David Baddiel and Jenny Eclair. Yesteryear's Bridget Jones's Diary climbed to 1.8m, and the film of The Beach added 385,485 to the 858,235 already sold. Mind/body/spirit, a portmanteau concept, continued to burgeon, raising Conversations with God to 150,000. Some oldies recovered from slumps, notably Wilbur Smith, through turning the clock back on his price to 1987. \u00a33.99 was a challenge to discounters but Asda managed, while Waterstone's complained: \"People won't know it's his new one!\" Another perennial, Stephen King, offered a novel serially on the internet, but gave up when the response was more clicks than dollars. Will others try their luck? \"Yes,\" says Ridout, \"these people follow all routes to market.\" In the accompanying fastseller list, which is exclusive to books published in paperback for the first time in 2000, the cut-off point is the highest ever, and the 154 titles that passed 100,000 is the largest.

In other pictures in Untitled Film Stills, we see a woman alone in America's open spaces - hitchhiking in an empty mountain landscape, or at the railroad station for Flagstaff, Arizona, or in a Manhattan street late at night.

      "body": "<p>As the 20th century came to an end, Newsweek magazine chose to mark its passing with a strong dose of the hokey cultural populism Americans have loved ever since the 1930s. Leading the celebration, Newsweek staffer Kenneth Auchincloss cast a long look back on the events of the \"people's century\" and opined that for once in human experience \"ordinary folks changed history\". </p> <p>In support of this bold assertion of popular empowerment, Auchincloss singled out a succession of heroes who had changed things over the course of the century: suffragettes, feminists, the anti-war and civil rights movements, and, finally, \"the entrepreneurs\", this last group illustrated with a drawing of Bill Gates. Although his story brimmed with 30s populist stylings, Auchincloss took pains to point out that the landmark economic reforms of that decade weren't nearly as wonderful as everyone thought. And while the story hailed the richest man in the world as a champion of the common people, the labour movement was not mentioned at all. </p> <p>Indeed, wherever one looked in the 90s, entrepreneurs were occupying the ideological space once filled by the noble sons of toil. From the pages of Newsweek to the smiling bubble-talk of CNBC, the cable channel devoted to covering the stock market, it was businessmen who were sounding off against the arrogance of elites, railing against the privilege of old money, protesting about false expertise and waging relentless, idealistic war on the principle of hierarchy wherever it could be found. </p> <p>From Deadheads to Nobel-laureate economists, from palaeo-conservatives to New Democrats, American leaders in the 90s came to believe that markets were a popular system, a far more democratic form of organisation than (democratically elected) governments. This is the central premise of what I call \"market populism\": that in addition to being mediums of exchange, markets are mediums of consent. With their mechanisms of supply and demand, poll and focus group, superstore and internet, markets managed to express the popular will more articulately and meaningfully than did mere elections. By their very nature markets conferred democratic legitimacy, markets brought down the pompous and the snooty, markets looked out for the interests of the little guy, markets gave us what we wanted. As journalist Robert Samuelson announced in 1998, \"the Market 'R' Us\". </p> <p>One of the reasons market populism prospered so fantastically in the 90s was that it was an extremely useful doctrine. As business leaders melded themselves with the common people, they discovered powerful new weapons to use against their traditional enemies in government and organised labour. Since it was markets that expressed the will of the people, virtually any criticism of business could be described as an act of \"elitism\" arising out of despicable contempt for the common man. </p> <p> According to market populism, elitists were not those who, say, watch sporting events from a private box, or spend their weekends pottering on a computer-driven yacht, or fire half their workforce and ship the factory south. No, elitists were the people on the other side of the equation: the trade unionists and Keynesians who believed that society could be organised in any way other than the market way. Since what the market does - no matter how whimsical, irrational or harmful - was the Will of the People, any scheme to operate outside its auspices or control its ravages was by definition a dangerous artifice, the hubris of false expertise. </p> <p>This fantasy of the market as an anti-elitist machine made the most sense when it was couched in the language of social class. Businessmen and pro-business politicians have always protested about the use of \"class war\" by their critics on the left; during the 90s, though, they happily used the tactic themselves, depicting the workings of the market as a kind of permanent social revolution in which daring entrepreneurs endlessly toppled fat cats and picked off the millions of lazy rich kids.</p> <p> The scions of ancient banking families were said to be finding their smug selves wiped out by the streetwise know-how of some kid with a goatee; the arrogant stockbrokers of old were being humiliated by the e-trade masses; the Wasps with their regimental ties were getting their asses kicked by the women, the Asians, the Africans, the Hispanics; the buttoned-down whip-cracking bosses were being fired by the corporate \"change agents\"; the self-assured network figures were being reduced to tears by the vox populi of the web. A thousand populist revolts shook the office blocks of the nation, and the great forums of corporate ideology overflowed with praise for in-your-face traders from gritty urban backgrounds, for the CEO who still retained the crude manners of the longshoreman. </p> <p>It was a strange faith but, by the middle of the 90s, it was a populism in the ascendancy. Everyone seemed to find what they wanted in the magic of markets. Markets were serving all tastes, markets were humiliating the pretentious, markets were permitting good art to triumph over bad, markets were overthrowing the man, markets were extinguishing discrimination, markets were making everyone rich. </p> <p>In the right hands, market populism could explain nearly any social phenomenon. The \"tiger economies\" of Asia had collapsed, market populists told us, because they had relied on the expertise of elites rather than the infinite wisdom of the people. Similarly, the economies of western Europe were stagnant because the arrogant aristocrats every red-blooded American knows run those lands were clinging to old welfare-state theories. The House of Morgan was swallowed up by Chase Manhattan because it was a snooty outfit that had foolishly tried to resist the democracy of markets. </p> <p>More important, market populism proved astonishingly versatile as a defence of any business beset by meddling critics in government, union or environmental movement. On the Wall Street Journal editorial page, one saw market populism wheeled out to defend the advertising industry, to defend the auto industry, to bolster demands that the software industry be permitted to import more workers, to hail stock options as the people's true currency and, most remarkably, to defend Microsoft from its antitrust pursuers. Since a company's size (like the value of a billionaire's pile) was simply a reflection of the people's love, antitrust itself was fundamentally illegitimate, a device used by elitist politicians, the Journal once proclaimed, \"to promote the interests of the few at the expense of the many\". </p> <p>Even after the Microsoft verdict had been announced, the paper continued to assert that the company \"should have argued that we have a monopoly because our customers want us to have one\". And when Al Gore began annoying the men of privilege last autumn with his (admittedly feeble) attacks on big business, the paper responded in the most direct manner imaginable. \"Mr Bush should tell Americans [that] when my opponent attacks 'big corporations', he's attacking you and me.\" </p> <p>Market populism proved particularly useful in the workplace. Whether you toiled for one of the great American corporations, for some zesty startup, or on an assembly line, workers in the 90s couldn't help but realise that class power was lopsided as never before. Management held all the cards in the 90s, and CEOs were able to work their will without encountering much organised resistance. The corporation \"delayered\", throwing off entire levels of white-collar workers; it \"disaggregated\", ridding itself of its extraneous operations; it embraced \"flexibility\", replacing career employees with zero-benefits temps; it \"outsourced\" every possible piece of work to the lowest bidder; it \"re-engineered\" its various processes in a less labour-intensive way; it \"disintermediated\", used new technology to cut out middlemen and move \"back office\" jobs to the lowest-paid climes on earth. Unions shrank before professionally directed assaults and, in the US, organised workers finally slipped below 10% of the private sector workforce. Meanwhile, the remuneration awarded to American CEOs rose to astronomical levels. In 1999, corporate chiefs were paid, on average, some 475 times what their blue-collar employees took home. </p> <p>Yet to read the management literature of the decade, what was really going on in the world of the corporation was democratisation. Whatever recommendations individual gurus might make regarding the structure of the workplace, the management literature of the 90s almost universally insisted that its larger project was liberation, giving a voice to the voiceless, \"empowering\" the individual, subverting the pretensions of the mighty, and striking blows against hierarchy of all kinds. </p> <p>Management theory performed this reversal by redefining the workplace power struggle. The problems of the corporation weren't its upward redistribution of wealth or its refusal to bargain with its workers collectively or the massive disparities between bosses and bossed; the real problems were moral ones - \"elitism\", \"arrogance\", \"certainty.\" And these were to be solved by embracing the Jacobin forces of the market ever more closely, by throwing out such distasteful relics of the past asloyalty and lifetime employment. </p> <p>Understood this way, the true warriors for workplace democracy weren't trade unionists; they were the new breed of executives - the ones who abjured stuffy suits for casual wear, the zany \"change agents\", the makers of wow. Readers of new business magazines like Fast Company and Business 2.0 thrilled to tales of caring CEOs, of bosses who sat in cubicles like everyone else, of white-collar workers who demanded the right to drink beer and wear jeans in the office. </p> <p>The entrepreneur, by virtue of his or her close relationship to the market, was the true bearer of populist humility - and also the true hero of the common man. \u00dcber-guru Tom Peters claimed that, in terms of the populist lexicon, the dotcom millionaires and the working class had switched moral positions - even stretching this absurd argument so far as to apply the populist keyword \"parasite\" to describe the very folks who once made up the labour movement. </p> <p>\"When I began working as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co in 1974,\" he wrote in 1997, \"'we' (the professional service people - accountants, lawyers, consultants, ad agency denizens) were considered the parasites... living off the sweat of real people's brows. Times have changed. And how! The nerds have won! Bill Gates is the richest man in the world! It is the Age of Brainware. Now the people who lift 'things' (the rapidly declining fraction) are the new parasites living off the carpal-tunnel syndrome of the computer programmers' perpetually strained keyboard hands.\" </p> <p>Again Bill Gates's money is thought, unproblematically and transparently, to endow him with the approval of the people, to establish him as vicar of the general will. This may seem silly at first, but it was a logic that yielded results. By insisting that bosses were the real commoners, that outsourcing was an act of humility, that downsizing was just an opportunity to pursue your personal authenticity, that corporations were, by virtue of their attunement to market forces, bearers of a kind of soulfulness that government and union could never touch, management theory brought an unprecedented degree of workplace quiescence. </p> <p>It was thanks, at least in part, to the hyperbolic prose of Tom Peters and his colleagues that so many of the downsized agreed that what had happened to them was right, was necessary, was justified; it was thanks to the revolutionary crowing of magazines like Fast Company that so many left the parking lots of their former employers in such an orderly fashion, talking confidently about their impending careers as \"free agents\". Even more tellingly, in a decade when unemployment got as low as 4% - making management extremely vulnerable to demands for increased wages - union organising and strike activity remained at their lowest points since the 1920s. That the US was able to endure the wrenching upward redistribution of wealth that it did in the 90s with only small, localised outbreaks of social unrest must be chalked up, in part, to the literature that explicitly sought to persuade the world of the goodness and the justice of that redistribution. </p> <p>Market populism did equally valuable service in the passionately, stridently optimistic rhetoric of the rising stock market. As everyone knows by now, the 90s was supposed to have been the age of Wall Street's \"democratisation\". The myth went like this. Once upon a time the world of finance had been a place of elites, of unbridled snobbery, of wealthy Wasps in suits, sneering at the common people and keeping this glorious thing, the stock market, all to themselves. But the great bull market of the 1990s, the myth continues, was something different: a bull market of the people, a powerful tool for economic democracy. This bull market was thought to be the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung of the ruling class, the final victory of the common people over their former masters. </p> <p>Sometimes this \"democratisation\" was spoken of as a sort of social uprising, a final routing of the snobbish old-guard culture of Wall Street. Sometimes it was said to be the market itself that had worked these great changes, that had humiliated the suits and enriched all sorts of colourful proletarians. Sometimes it was described as a demographic phenomenon, a reflection of the vast percentage of the nation's population that was now entrusting their savings to the market. But however you looked at it, one thing was sure. The common people, we were told, understood this market, warmed to it instinctively the way they would a beloved relative. </p> <p>At the same time, we were told, the old-money elites just didn't get it, and they flailed and failed as the little people paid them back for centuries of snooty hauteur. The decade was filled with corny tales of down-home investors whipping the pros. In the early 90s we thrilled to stories of Warren Buffett, the down-home billionaire; of Peter Lynch, the man who told us to forget about the complex stuff and invest in the companies that made our favourite everyday products; and of the Beardstown Ladies, a group of small-town Illinois grandmas whose local investment club was said to have racked up some gigantic figure or other by investing in humble, populist companies like Wal-Mart. The point of the episode wasn't the ladies' investing advice, which was fairly rudimentary (like how to read the stock listings in the newspaper), but instead a moral lesson, a demonstration that even society's feeblest, lowliest and worst-informed - kindly grannies from the ever innocent small-town midwest - could beat, as they put it, the \"self-important MBAs\" of \"New York, or Zurich, or Tokyo\". </p> <p>In the late 90s we were deluged with tales of average people prospering hugely by investing in hi-tech stocks: the secretaries who had been transformed into mil lionaires by the grace of Microsoft; the college dropouts whose stock options had showered on them the kind of money most of us can't even imagine. The fantastic appreciation in internet shares in 1998 and 1999 was said to be a special sort of boom, one that was only comprehensible to the unpretentious. While the hated \"experts\", those cosmopolitan sophisticates who are the enemy in all populist narratives, carped and doubted, the common people trusted their new corporate heroes without reservation or cynicism. While the old money looked at the numbers and sold short, We, the People got it. The internet was democracy itself, the golden promise of interactivity descended unto earth to help usher us into a populist utopia. And in each of the dotcom favourites we perceived some distillation of market populism: an online bookstore that was supposed to be the apotheosis of democratic business practice; a vendor of airline tickets that empowered consumers; a flea market without walls that we fancied a \"community\" in the most exalted sense. </p> <p>None of it really worked out as promised, of course. Just as the Beardstown Ladies were later revealed to have exaggerated their gains, so all the overheated talk about the infinite democracy of cyberspace turned out to be the concerted puffery of an industry whose real source of optimism was its discovery that it was able to palm off one overpriced flotation after another on the most credulous market in decades. </p> <p>As the Nasdaq fell some 50% from its high in March 2000, we learned the appalling price of Wall Street's phoney populism. But it may have been too late. In the political sphere, Wall Street was able to parlay what seemed to be overwhelming public support into victory after victory over its traditional antagonists in government. Antitrust enforcement was allowed to go slack (the Microsoft case notwithstanding), the Glass-Steagall banking act was repealed, and - glory of glories - a Republican president was elected promising to \"privatise\" social security, to turn over to Wall Street the vast public funds that secure the nation's retirement. </p> <p>Nor was all of this confined to the US. Wherever the \"New Economy\" touched its magic finger, it seems, the same perverse cultural logic appeared, recasting economic discussion along these oddly inverted democratic lines. In Britain it was most clearly identifiable in the person of Tony Blair, a man who has so perfected the fake populist style that he hands out honours to humble lollipop ladies with one hand while privatising the Underground with the other. But it also informs the work of political theorists like Charles Leadbeater of Demos, whose 1999 \"New Economy\" book Living on Thin Air asserts that democracy and the dawning \"knowledge economy\" are somehow intrinsically linked. Even while admitting that the \"New Economy\" wildly skews the distribution of a society's wealth, Leadbeater insisted that it was nonetheless a more democratic mode than its predecessor, since it thrived on \"a culture of dissent, dispute, disrespect for authority, diversity and experimentation\". Sneer at the fat cats all you want - just don't interfere with their stock options. </p> <p>Tellingly, Leadbeater also suggested that to fully swallow the ways of the \"New Economy\", Britain would have to adopt a new \"narrative\", an \"engaging and compelling account of [the] future that captures the popular imagination, and which people can buy into, endorsing and enacting it in their everyday lives\". And it was as a narrative of social legitimacy that market populism has proven most useful. Looking out at what has been the most lopsided prosperity in our lifetimes, market populism told us that all was well, that with the demise of the welfare state and the crushing of union power a newer, more extreme form of economic democracy was being born. Because our billionaires were so cool, because our websites were so very interactive, this was the most democratic of all possible worlds. </p> <p>\u0095 This article is based on Thomas Frank's One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy, which is published on Monday by Secker &amp; Warburg (\u00a317.99).

      "bodyText": "As the 20th century came to an end, Newsweek magazine chose to mark its passing with a strong dose of the hokey cultural populism Americans have loved ever since the 1930s. Leading the celebration, Newsweek staffer Kenneth Auchincloss cast a long look back on the events of the \"people's century\" and opined that for once in human experience \"ordinary folks changed history\". In support of this bold assertion of popular empowerment, Auchincloss singled out a succession of heroes who had changed things over the course of the century: suffragettes, feminists, the anti-war and civil rights movements, and, finally, \"the entrepreneurs\", this last group illustrated with a drawing of Bill Gates. Although his story brimmed with 30s populist stylings, Auchincloss took pains to point out that the landmark economic reforms of that decade weren't nearly as wonderful as everyone thought. And while the story hailed the richest man in the world as a champion of the common people, the labour movement was not mentioned at all. Indeed, wherever one looked in the 90s, entrepreneurs were occupying the ideological space once filled by the noble sons of toil. From the pages of Newsweek to the smiling bubble-talk of CNBC, the cable channel devoted to covering the stock market, it was businessmen who were sounding off against the arrogance of elites, railing against the privilege of old money, protesting about false expertise and waging relentless, idealistic war on the principle of hierarchy wherever it could be found. From Deadheads to Nobel-laureate economists, from palaeo-conservatives to New Democrats, American leaders in the 90s came to believe that markets were a popular system, a far more democratic form of organisation than (democratically elected) governments. This is the central premise of what I call \"market populism\": that in addition to being mediums of exchange, markets are mediums of consent. With their mechanisms of supply and demand, poll and focus group, superstore and internet, markets managed to express the popular will more articulately and meaningfully than did mere elections. By their very nature markets conferred democratic legitimacy, markets brought down the pompous and the snooty, markets looked out for the interests of the little guy, markets gave us what we wanted.

The scions of ancient banking families were said to be finding their smug selves wiped out by the streetwise know-how of some kid with a goatee; the arrogant stockbrokers of old were being humiliated by the e-trade masses; the Wasps with their regimental ties were getting their asses kicked by the women, the Asians, the Africans, the Hispanics; the buttoned-down whip-cracking bosses were being fired by the corporate \"change agents\"; the self-assured network figures were being reduced to tears by the vox populi of the web.

The fantastic appreciation in internet shares in 1998 and 1999 was said to be a special sort of boom, one that was only comprehensible to the unpretentious.

Looking out at what has been the most lopsided prosperity in our lifetimes, market populism told us that all was well, that with the demise of the welfare state and the crushing of union power a newer, more extreme form of economic democracy was being born. Because our billionaires were so cool, because our websites were so very interactive, this was the most democratic of all possible worlds. \u0095 This article is based on Thomas Frank's One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy, which is published on Monday by Secker &amp; Warburg (\u00a317.99).

      "body": "<p>Halfway through the opening ceremony of last year's Sydney Olympic Games, hundreds of huge, black-clad men with box-shaped heads entered Stadium Australia and began to dance around fountains of sparks and collapsible wooden huts. The crowd in the stadium went wild at the representation of legendary 19th-century outlaw Ned Kelly, but watching it all on television, the Australian author Peter Carey groaned. </p> <p>Carey's novel, True History of the Kelly Gang, was due for publication in Australia a month later. It is an ambitious book that not only probes a key episode of Australian history, but also makes large claims for Kelly's importance to Australia's present. Carey has one of the witnesses to Kelly's final battle - the famous one where he wears the homemade armour - rhetorically ask at one point: \"What is it about us Australians, eh? What is wrong with us? Do we not have a Jefferson? A Disraeli? Might not we find someone better to admire than a horse thief and a murderer?\" </p> <p>Carey's initial dismay at the representation of Kelly was based on a belief that the country was selling its Jefferson short. \"Yes, when I first saw the Olympic thing I was a bit appalled,\" he says. \"I thought the bucketheads and sparklers were unbelievably stupid and thoughtless and cheap. But I then saw the real point. So many Australians were pleased to see him there as part of the story.\" </p> <p>Just as contentious as the suggestion that Kelly's legacy still shapes Australia was the fact that Carey was tackling the subject at all. He has lived in New York with his wife, theatre director Alison Summers, and their two sons, since the late 80s. To come back and tackle the nation's most potent myth was risky, and indeed, coverage of the book duly broke out of the arts ghetto and on to the news pages. \"There was some bullshit controversy about me glorifying a murderer,\" he explains. \"But it is bullshit. Most people don't feel that. Kelly was a popular hero at the time of his death and his reputation has been stable ever since. Only official Australia has always hated him.\" </p> <p>Friend and fellow novelist Patrick McGrath was in Australia when the book was published. \"It was clear he had breathed life into this iconic national figure and had aroused powerful antagonisms,\" says McGrath. \"There were letters to the papers condemning his suggestion that Kelly was the Thomas Jefferson of Australia. That reaction indicated the statement was true, but also very troubling for Australians. That, in fact, a strand of their character could be traced back to a murderer and a thief who wound up on the gallows.\" </p> <p>McGrath watched Carey reading to a packed hall at the Brisbane Writers' Festival. \"His role was almost bardic in that he had articulated one of the great myths of this people. Here was an Australian author speaking directly to a large section of the Australian people about who they were. It is such a rare thing for a literary novelist to plug in like that.\" </p> <p>The writer Caryl Phillips sees Carey's writing in more global terms. \"When I first encountered him in the 80s, his work was categorised as being complex, rather challenging novels from Australia. People were very concerned with the formal invention in his work. But to me Peter seemed to be doing a re-mapping of Australian history. </p> <p>\"In that sense he was a quintessential post-colonial writer who was trying to contribute to the writing of a national literature of Australia. I saw him as part of a group of writers, including Rushdie and Achebe and Walcott; people for whom the act of writing literature is also about reclaiming history.\" </p> <p>Carey's route to reclaiming history has involved using the classic literature of the colonial power. His Booker prize-winner, Oscar and Lucinda, took Edmund Gosse's Father and Son as its starting point in its imaginative and charming evocation of love and God in 19th-century Australia. He has also drawn heavily on Sterne's Tristram Shandy, and more recently, in his 1997 novel Jack Maggs, Carey gutted Great Expectations to interrogate the relationship between empire and penal colony. The fact that he has used a homegrown template for his new book sees the 57-year-old author returning home, in his case literally so, to the rural Australia where he was born. </p> <p>His family lived in the country town of Bacchus Marsh, about 30 miles from Melbourne. His parents had started a car business in their backyard during the Depression and by the time Peter was born - he is by 10 years the youngest of three children - they had a prosperous dealership; first Ford, then General Motors. His father had worked with cars all his life. When aged 11 he was arrested for driving without a licence. \"And this wasn't in the country,\" laughs Carey. \"This was in Melbourne, and he was teaching someone else to drive at the time.\" </p> <p>Carey says he was always proud of his father because \"he never took any shit from General Motors\", but acknowledges that the very physical, aggressive and alcoholic environment in which he operated took its toll. \"He did business in pubs and became an alcoholic. He was never unpleasant or violent, but he was continually pissed.\" Eventually his elder brother and sister joined the business, but it was always made clear that there wasn't going to be room for Peter. The business eventually provided for two generations of working lives, but was sold when his siblings retired and the building is now a video store. Both his elder brother and sister still live in Bacchus Marsh. </p> <p>Although Carey always recognised he would never be part of the family business, he did know that he would follow his siblings to boarding school. After attending the local primary school, he was sent at the age of 10 to the exclusive Geelong Grammar, popularly known as the Eton of Australia. Both Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer went there, as did Prince Charles some years after Carey had left. Although the Carey family were seen as comfortably off in Bacchus Marsh, when he arrived at Geelong, Carey says he was \"positively proletarian\". Even to his untrained ear, he was convinced that some people were speaking with home counties accents, and everyone was known by their surnames. \"In the seven years I was there, no one ever called me Peter,\" he once recalled. </p> <p>He says the class differences manifested themselves in several ways. \"I had good friends at school whom I never saw in the holidays. The friends I did see were all the sons of solicitors or doctors in small towns. More my class.\" One of these boys was Peter Smalley, now a writer living in London. \"Neither of us were part of that squatocracy - the equivalent to the English landed classes who founded the school - so we both felt to some extent excluded,\" says Smalley. \"Peter was obviously a bright kid in the class, but in a school like that you get ahead by being sporty or part of the establishment, and he was never into all that.\" Smalley says that any unhappiness was quickly repressed. \"It's not dissimilar to being in the army or prison except that it is much more expensive. You have to shut off the more vulnerable side of yourself and if, for instance, you preferred books to sport, you had to repress an awful lot of your personality in order to survive.\" </p> <p>Carey remembers being very enthusiastic, but not very gifted. \"I was the type who would end up captain of the football fifth team.\" He agrees with Smalley that being sent to the school was hugely traumatic, although for years he didn't admit it even to himself. \"And what's worse is that very quickly, having survived in the posh place, you can't bear to go back to the place where you now think the people are impossibly vulgar. You get dislocated.\" </p> <p>He says he was over 50 before he realised that his fiction was full of orphans, metaphorical and actual. The obvious larger historical and political point is Australia being the orphan of England. His novel, Illywhacker, is about seeking possession of a place; Jack Maggs returns to Australia to claim his real home; and going home is also important to the Kelly gang. \"I first thought it was because I was lazy and it is so much easier not having to fill in the family. But now I think there is something more going on.\" Like most writers, he has been wary of going into therapy. \"I thought it better not to know where things are coming from because it is better not to disturb the sediment that I feed on. But now I think it might be interesting. I think I would like to do it.\" </p> <p>Carey has said that he read virtually none of the English literature canon until adulthood, and when he left school it was to be a scientist. His early short stories are steeped in contemporary science, and he was even initially regarded as a sort of science-fiction writer. \"What interested me was not only the rational structure of things and how they are made, but also their mystery. Discovering that is a link to literature.\" </p> <p>His organic chemistry and zoology degree course at Monash University, Melbourne, was cut short after he failed his first-year exams and was then involved in a serious car accident. \"Just after the crash I was covered in all this blood and shattered glass, but the first thought I had was that I've got an excuse to leave university.\" He soon got a job in a Melbourne advertising agency run by an ex-member of the communist party, and his literary education began. His colleagues were part-time writers and they introduced him to Faulkner, Joyce and Beckett. \"I thought As I Lay Dying was exhilarating. It was so important to me that I never want to read it again in case I change my mind. That's why I wanted to be a writer. To read Faulkner for the first time was for me like discovering another planet. The pleasure of that language, the politics of giving voice to the voiceless.\" </p> <p>In 1964 he wrote his first, unpublished, novel. \"I was so stupidly confident I just told everyone I was going to do it. I was going to walk out on to the field with Proust and Joyce.\" The same year he married his first wife, Leigh Weetman. Although his fiction closely draws on his experiences in terms of society and landscape, it rarely reads as being confessional or directly autobiographical. But he has published several pieces of personal reminiscence, one of which is about his delayed coming to terms with an abortion (then illegal) which Weetman had when she was 20 and he was 18. In the same piece he goes on to explain his regrets at not naming the three still-born children they had when they were later married. \"I wish only that we had honoured those children with a plaque, a name,\" he wrote. \"I will always wish that, for ever.\" </p> <p>Most writers have hard-luck stories about early rejections, but Carey's are collectors' items. His second novel was first accepted and then rejected by a publisher in Australia, who sent it on to Victor Gollancz in London. Shortly afterwards Carey was travelling in Europe - he lived in London for a year in 1969 - and went to the Gollancz office. \"I explained to the receptionist that Mr Gollancz had a manuscript of mine which he was going to publish. She asked me to wait a moment and when she came back a few minutes later she had the manuscript with her which she gave back to me. And that was that.\" </p> <p>While living in London, he wrote a novel called Wog. \"The title was contentious but that was the least of its problems,\" he says. The novel included blurry, photocopied pictures and notes written on cornflake boxes. \"I vowed that these things were so essential to the book that I would never publish it without them. Then a respectable London publishers said they liked the book and wanted to know whether I would publish without all this stuff. I agonised for a long time and eventually said they could. Then, of course, they said no.\" </p> <p>After these disappointments Carey returned to Australia in 1970 and decided to write short stories. It was an inspired tactical retreat. \"After Wog, these stories began to work in a way that nothing had worked before. They felt like the first authentic things I had done.\" </p> <p>Bruce Woodcock has written a critical study of Carey's work and says the early stories do read like an avant-garde writer coming into the mainstream. \"He did read a lot of strange stuff in the 60s and 70s,\" says Woodcock. \"He is still a novelist of ideas, but he learned to write wonderful narrative. With one or two exceptions the characters in the stories are less interesting than in the novels, but they have a real fizz and pizzazz to them.\" They also exhibit a political prescience. Woodcock says his story War Crimes predicted the move to global capitalism. \"These hippie capitalists are sent to sort out a frozen-food depot in the desert. They take their job literally, and get their guns out and blow people away for not performing. He foresaw Thatcherism and Reaganism.\" </p> <p>Carey was active on the left throughout the 70s and, although too old for the draft, was a leading member of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee, which he remembers as a family business run by an old Stalinist. \"All my friends were communists, Maoists, Trotskyists. I talked for hours and really badly wanted to be converted, but never was, and I never joined a political party. But I was one of those idiots who thought the Cultural Revolution was a fantastic thing. It's embarrassing, particularly now I have met people who went through it all and endured it.\" </p> <p>The critic and writer Hermione Lee says Carey is a \"genuinely socialist novelist, which sounds awfully prim and limiting. But he is always writing about the dispossessed or people who have been done over by forces of authority. He often gives voice to the voiceless, people who have no literary space. In Ned Kelly, every so often he lifts his eyes from the main story and gives you a picture of this whole people of Irish immigrants who have been brutalised and are struggling for some space and some reasonable way of life.\" </p> <p>In 1973 Carey separated from Weetman. The following year his debut collection of short stories, The Fat Man in History, was published, and he began to live with the painter Margot Hutcheson. He got a job running the Grey advertising agency office in Sydney and moved with Margot to an alternative community at Yandina in Queensland. \"For 18 months I worked flat out and then I moved to Queensland and worked one week in four. I really milked it.\" He says he kept his job secret from the rest of the community for quite a long time, but when they found out they were quite pleased that someone like him was working in advertising. \"They were very pragmatic hippies.\" </p> <p>Carey went on to own his own agency - for which he again worked part-time - and didn't really leave advertising until he moved to the US in 1989. For many years he played down his advertising career, but now acknowledges that it was important to him. \"I think I felt socially embarrassed about advertising and would become defensive with my literary, leftwing friends. But for years I wrote every day and didn't worry if it sold or not. And I never really thought there was anything wrong with selling. My dad was a car salesman, after all.\" His best-known campaign was for Lindeman's wine, with the catchline: \"You make us smile, Dr Lindeman.\" </p> <p>In 1979 he published a second collection of stories in Australia, War Crimes, and a year later Faber &amp; Faber published stories from both collections in the UK, in a volume confusingly also called The Fat Man in History. His first novel, Bliss, was published in 1981 and his reputation began to grow. In 1984 he and Margot were living in Bellingen, a bohemian neighbourhood near Sydney, when he was asked to work on an eco-political rock musical with performance artist Mike Mullins. Because of Carey's name, it attracted significant funding, but \"they didn't want a writer because they didn't believe in writers,\" he recalls. \"They asked me to construct a literary scaffolding for a play. That's where I met Alison. I fell in love and never went back to Bellingen.\" Things were further complicated, as Carey explains, when \"Mike went off to comfort Margot.\" </p> <p>He describes the eventual production as \"like Springtime for Hitler, but working the way it was meant to work. For the first 30 seconds on the opening night you thought it might be all right.\" By the time the play had eventually been produced, Carey had published his second novel, Illywhacker. The rollicking journey through Australian history, as told by a 139-year-old conman, was shortlisted for the Booker prize, and Carey made the journey to London. \"I'd never even read aloud so the thought of standing up in the Guildhall and speaking was terrifying,\" he remembers. \"The only thing I could do to calm myself down was to imagine someone else winning. I wanted either Doris Lessing, because of her lifetime of work, or Keri Hulme [whose book The Bone People was the eventual and controversial winner] because the money would make a difference to her life.\" </p> <p>Despite being shortlisted for the Booker, Carey still had no plans to give up the day job - or week-a-month job as it was by then. \"Illywhacker is the type of book you only write once. It's a big, reckless sort of thing. When I saw how long it was I was surprised that anyone would publish it. I have a dilemma that I'm only interested in doing things that are risky, and then I'm always terrified of the risks. Illywhacker felt like a very big risk.\" </p> <p>His follow-up was equally ambitious. Oscar and Lucinda came in at over 500 pages and this time won the Booker in 1988. It was an extremely strong year, with Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses and Bruce Chatwin's last novel, Utz, also shortlisted. Blake Morrison was one of the judges. \"Michael Foot was chairman and was a great fan of the Satanic Verses - this was pre-fatwa - but four of us had this special feeling for Oscar and Lucinda. It was about as unanimous as it gets with the Booker. Foot took it on the chin, and so did Salman Rushdie. People had accused him of behaving badly a few years previously when Coetzee had won, but he liked Carey, and liked the book, and was grace itself.\" </p> <p>The prize elevated Carey to the front rank of writers and soon after he moved to New York. The typical story of clever Australians leaving to succeed? \"Not really,\" says Carey. It was the generation before him that had to leave to have a career - Clive James, Germaine Greer. \"You can date it quite precisely by the fact that they left by ship. There was nothing for them in that Australia, but for me it wasn't so bad. The early 70s had been a heady time for those on the left. The Labour government quickly recognised China and withdrew from Vietnam. People started coming home, as opposed to emigrating. In the arts, there were opportunities.\" </p> <p>Which begs the question: why did he move? \"Partly because it was possible,\" he says. \"But I admit I never imagined it would go on this long. I used to say that coming here was a moral holiday. Then my son said to me one day that 'we bombed Iraq'. And I said, hang on a minute 'they' bombed Iraq, not us. But it made me think.

He doesn't handle it as well as the historical novels with fantasy, like Jack Maggs or Oscar and Lucinda.\" </p> <p>Since Tristan Smith, Carey has written a children's book, The Big Bazoohley, Jack Maggs, and now the Kelly book. \"Jack Maggs isn't set in Australia but it is totally about Australia,\" he says, \"so I suppose Ned Kelly does represent a relaxing about the fact that I can write an Australian book.\" Patrick McGrath says that Carey knew he was doing something important when he started the Kelly project. \"He knew it was a big risk because he was moving in on this central iconic figure in the Australian consciousness.

      "bodyText": "Halfway through the opening ceremony of last year's Sydney Olympic Games, hundreds of huge, black-clad men with box-shaped heads entered Stadium Australia and began to dance around fountains of sparks and collapsible wooden huts. The crowd in the stadium went wild at the representation of legendary 19th-century outlaw Ned Kelly, but watching it all on television, the Australian author Peter Carey groaned. Carey's novel, True History of the Kelly Gang, was due for publication in Australia a month later. It is an ambitious book that not only probes a key episode of Australian history, but also makes large claims for Kelly's importance to Australia's present. Carey has one of the witnesses to Kelly's final battle - the famous one where he wears the homemade armour - rhetorically ask at one point: \"What is it about us Australians, eh? What is wrong with us? Do we not have a Jefferson? A Disraeli? Might not we find someone better to admire than a horse thief and a murderer?\" Carey's initial dismay at the representation of Kelly was based on a belief that the country was selling its Jefferson short. \"Yes, when I first saw the Olympic thing I was a bit appalled,\" he says. \"I thought the bucketheads and sparklers were unbelievably stupid and thoughtless and cheap. But I then saw the real point. So many Australians were pleased to see him there as part of the story.\" Just as contentious as the suggestion that Kelly's legacy still shapes Australia was the fact that Carey was tackling the subject at all. He has lived in New York with his wife, theatre director Alison Summers, and their two sons, since the late 80s. To come back and tackle the nation's most potent myth was risky, and indeed, coverage of the book duly broke out of the arts ghetto and on to the news pages. \"There was some bullshit controversy about me glorifying a murderer,\" he explains. \"But it is bullshit. Most people don't feel that. Kelly was a popular hero at the time of his death and his reputation has been stable ever since. Only official Australia has always hated him.\" Friend and fellow novelist Patrick McGrath was in Australia when the book was published. \"It was clear he had breathed life into this iconic national figure and had aroused powerful antagonisms,\" says McGrath. \"There were letters to the papers condemning his suggestion that Kelly was the Thomas Jefferson of Australia. That reaction indicated the statement was true, but also very troubling for Australians. That, in fact, a strand of their character could be traced back to a murderer and a thief who wound up on the gallows.\" McGrath watched Carey reading to a packed hall at the Brisbane Writers' Festival. \"His role was almost bardic in that he had articulated one of the great myths of this people. Here was an Australian author speaking directly to a large section of the Australian people about who they were. It is such a rare thing for a literary novelist to plug in like that.\" The writer Caryl Phillips sees Carey's writing in more global terms. \"When I first encountered him in the 80s, his work was categorised as being complex, rather challenging novels from Australia. People were very concerned with the formal invention in his work. But to me Peter seemed to be doing a re-mapping of Australian history. \"In that sense he was a quintessential post-colonial writer who was trying to contribute to the writing of a national literature of Australia. I saw him as part of a group of writers, including Rushdie and Achebe and Walcott; people for whom the act of writing literature is also about reclaiming history.\" Carey's route to reclaiming history has involved using the classic literature of the colonial power. His Booker prize-winner, Oscar and Lucinda, took Edmund Gosse's Father and Son as its starting point in its imaginative and charming evocation of love and God in 19th-century Australia. He has also drawn heavily on Sterne's Tristram Shandy, and more recently, in his 1997 novel Jack Maggs, Carey gutted Great Expectations to interrogate the relationship between empire and penal colony. The fact that he has used a homegrown template for his new book sees the 57-year-old author returning home, in his case literally so, to the rural Australia where he was born. His family lived in the country town of Bacchus Marsh, about 30 miles from Melbourne. His parents had started a car business in their backyard during the Depression and by the time Peter was born - he is by 10 years the youngest of three children - they had a prosperous dealership; first Ford, then General Motors. His father had worked with cars all his life. When aged 11 he was arrested for driving without a licence. \"And this wasn't in the country,\" laughs Carey. \"This was in Melbourne, and he was teaching someone else to drive at the time.\" Carey says he was always proud of his father because \"he never took any shit from General Motors\", but acknowledges that the very physical, aggressive and alcoholic environment in which he operated took its toll. \"He did business in pubs and became an alcoholic. He was never unpleasant or violent, but he was continually pissed.\" Eventually his elder brother and sister joined the business, but it was always made clear that there wasn't going to be room for Peter. The business eventually provided for two generations of working lives, but was sold when his siblings retired and the building is now a video store. Both his elder brother and sister still live in Bacchus Marsh. Although Carey always recognised he would never be part of the family business, he did know that he would follow his siblings to boarding school. After attending the local primary school, he was sent at the age of 10 to the exclusive Geelong Grammar, popularly known as the Eton of Australia. Both Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer went there, as did Prince Charles some years after Carey had left. Although the Carey family were seen as comfortably off in Bacchus Marsh, when he arrived at Geelong, Carey says he was \"positively proletarian\". Even to his untrained ear, he was convinced that some people were speaking with home counties accents, and everyone was known by their surnames. \"In the seven years I was there, no one ever called me Peter,\" he once recalled. He says the class differences manifested themselves in several ways. \"I had good friends at school whom I never saw in the holidays. The friends I did see were all the sons of solicitors or doctors in small towns. More my class.\" One of these boys was Peter Smalley, now a writer living in London. \"Neither of us were part of that squatocracy - the equivalent to the English landed classes who founded the school - so we both felt to some extent excluded,\" says Smalley. \"Peter was obviously a bright kid in the class, but in a school like that you get ahead by being sporty or part of the establishment, and he was never into all that.\" Smalley says that any unhappiness was quickly repressed. \"It's not dissimilar to being in the army or prison except that it is much more expensive. You have to shut off the more vulnerable side of yourself and if, for instance, you preferred books to sport, you had to repress an awful lot of your personality in order to survive.\" Carey remembers being very enthusiastic, but not very gifted. \"I was the type who would end up captain of the football fifth team.\" He agrees with Smalley that being sent to the school was hugely traumatic, although for years he didn't admit it even to himself. \"And what's worse is that very quickly, having survived in the posh place, you can't bear to go back to the place where you now think the people are impossibly vulgar. You get dislocated.\" He says he was over 50 before he realised that his fiction was full of orphans, metaphorical and actual. The obvious larger historical and political point is Australia being the orphan of England. His novel, Illywhacker, is about seeking possession of a place; Jack Maggs returns to Australia to claim his real home; and going home is also important to the Kelly gang. \"I first thought it was because I was lazy and it is so much easier not having to fill in the family. But now I think there is something more going on.\" Like most writers, he has been wary of going into therapy. \"I thought it better not to know where things are coming from because it is better not to disturb the sediment that I feed on. But now I think it might be interesting. I think I would like to do it.\" Carey has said that he read virtually none of the English literature canon until adulthood, and when he left school it was to be a scientist. His early short stories are steeped in contemporary science, and he was even initially regarded as a sort of science-fiction writer. \"What interested me was not only the rational structure of things and how they are made, but also their mystery. Discovering that is a link to literature.\" His organic chemistry and zoology degree course at Monash University, Melbourne, was cut short after he failed his first-year exams and was then involved in a serious car accident. \"Just after the crash I was covered in all this blood and shattered glass, but the first thought I had was that I've got an excuse to leave university.\" He soon got a job in a Melbourne advertising agency run by an ex-member of the communist party, and his literary education began. His colleagues were part-time writers and they introduced him to Faulkner, Joyce and Beckett. \"I thought As I Lay Dying was exhilarating. It was so important to me that I never want to read it again in case I change my mind. That's why I wanted to be a writer. To read Faulkner for the first time was for me like discovering another planet. The pleasure of that language, the politics of giving voice to the voiceless.\" In 1964 he wrote his first, unpublished, novel. \"I was so stupidly confident I just told everyone I was going to do it. I was going to walk out on to the field with Proust and Joyce.\" The same year he married his first wife, Leigh Weetman. Although his fiction closely draws on his experiences in terms of society and landscape, it rarely reads as being confessional or directly autobiographical. But he has published several pieces of personal reminiscence, one of which is about his delayed coming to terms with an abortion (then illegal) which Weetman had when she was 20 and he was 18. In the same piece he goes on to explain his regrets at not naming the three still-born children they had when they were later married. \"I wish only that we had honoured those children with a plaque, a name,\" he wrote. \"I will always wish that, for ever.\" Most writers have hard-luck stories about early rejections, but Carey's are collectors' items. His second novel was first accepted and then rejected by a publisher in Australia, who sent it on to Victor Gollancz in London. Shortly afterwards Carey was travelling in Europe - he lived in London for a year in 1969 - and went to the Gollancz office. \"I explained to the receptionist that Mr Gollancz had a manuscript of mine which he was going to publish. She asked me to wait a moment and when she came back a few minutes later she had the manuscript with her which she gave back to me. And that was that.\" While living in London, he wrote a novel called Wog. \"The title was contentious but that was the least of its problems,\" he says. The novel included blurry, photocopied pictures and notes written on cornflake boxes. \"I vowed that these things were so essential to the book that I would never publish it without them. Then a respectable London publishers said they liked the book and wanted to know whether I would publish without all this stuff. I agonised for a long time and eventually said they could. Then, of course, they said no.\" After these disappointments Carey returned to Australia in 1970 and decided to write short stories. It was an inspired tactical retreat. \"After Wog, these stories began to work in a way that nothing had worked before. They felt like the first authentic things I had done.\" Bruce Woodcock has written a critical study of Carey's work and says the early stories do read like an avant-garde writer coming into the mainstream. \"He did read a lot of strange stuff in the 60s and 70s,\" says Woodcock. \"He is still a novelist of ideas, but he learned to write wonderful narrative. With one or two exceptions the characters in the stories are less interesting than in the novels, but they have a real fizz and pizzazz to them.\" They also exhibit a political prescience. Woodcock says his story War Crimes predicted the move to global capitalism. \"These hippie capitalists are sent to sort out a frozen-food depot in the desert. They take their job literally, and get their guns out and blow people away for not performing. He foresaw Thatcherism and Reaganism.\" Carey was active on the left throughout the 70s and, although too old for the draft, was a leading member of the Vietnam Moratorium Committee, which he remembers as a family business run by an old Stalinist. \"All my friends were communists, Maoists, Trotskyists. I talked for hours and really badly wanted to be converted, but never was, and I never joined a political party. But I was one of those idiots who thought the Cultural Revolution was a fantastic thing. It's embarrassing, particularly now I have met people who went through it all and endured it.\" The critic and writer Hermione Lee says Carey is a \"genuinely socialist novelist, which sounds awfully prim and limiting. But he is always writing about the dispossessed or people who have been done over by forces of authority. He often gives voice to the voiceless, people who have no literary space. In Ned Kelly, every so often he lifts his eyes from the main story and gives you a picture of this whole people of Irish immigrants who have been brutalised and are struggling for some space and some reasonable way of life.\" In 1973 Carey separated from Weetman. The following year his debut collection of short stories, The Fat Man in History, was published, and he began to live with the painter Margot Hutcheson. He got a job running the Grey advertising agency office in Sydney and moved with Margot to an alternative community at Yandina in Queensland. \"For 18 months I worked flat out and then I moved to Queensland and worked one week in four. I really milked it.\" He says he kept his job secret from the rest of the community for quite a long time, but when they found out they were quite pleased that someone like him was working in advertising. \"They were very pragmatic hippies.\" Carey went on to own his own agency - for which he again worked part-time - and didn't really leave advertising until he moved to the US in 1989. For many years he played down his advertising career, but now acknowledges that it was important to him. \"I think I felt socially embarrassed about advertising and would become defensive with my literary, leftwing friends. But for years I wrote every day and didn't worry if it sold or not. And I never really thought there was anything wrong with selling. My dad was a car salesman, after all.\" His best-known campaign was for Lindeman's wine, with the catchline: \"You make us smile, Dr Lindeman.\" In 1979 he published a second collection of stories in Australia, War Crimes, and a year later Faber &amp; Faber published stories from both collections in the UK, in a volume confusingly also called The Fat Man in History. His first novel, Bliss, was published in 1981 and his reputation began to grow. In 1984 he and Margot were living in Bellingen, a bohemian neighbourhood near Sydney, when he was asked to work on an eco-political rock musical with performance artist Mike Mullins. Because of Carey's name, it attracted significant funding, but \"they didn't want a writer because they didn't believe in writers,\" he recalls. \"They asked me to construct a literary scaffolding for a play. That's where I met Alison. I fell in love and never went back to Bellingen.\" Things were further complicated, as Carey explains, when \"Mike went off to comfort Margot.\" He describes the eventual production as \"like Springtime for Hitler, but working the way it was meant to work. For the first 30 seconds on the opening night you thought it might be all right.\" By the time the play had eventually been produced, Carey had published his second novel, Illywhacker. The rollicking journey through Australian history, as told by a 139-year-old conman, was shortlisted for the Booker prize, and Carey made the journey to London. \"I'd never even read aloud so the thought of standing up in the Guildhall and speaking was terrifying,\" he remembers. \"The only thing I could do to calm myself down was to imagine someone else winning. I wanted either Doris Lessing, because of her lifetime of work, or Keri Hulme [whose book The Bone People was the eventual and controversial winner] because the money would make a difference to her life.\" Despite being shortlisted for the Booker, Carey still had no plans to give up the day job - or week-a-month job as it was by then. \"Illywhacker is the type of book you only write once. It's a big, reckless sort of thing. When I saw how long it was I was surprised that anyone would publish it. I have a dilemma that I'm only interested in doing things that are risky, and then I'm always terrified of the risks. Illywhacker felt like a very big risk.\" His follow-up was equally ambitious. Oscar and Lucinda came in at over 500 pages and this time won the Booker in 1988. It was an extremely strong year, with Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses and Bruce Chatwin's last novel, Utz, also shortlisted. Blake Morrison was one of the judges. \"Michael Foot was chairman and was a great fan of the Satanic Verses - this was pre-fatwa - but four of us had this special feeling for Oscar and Lucinda. It was about as unanimous as it gets with the Booker. Foot took it on the chin, and so did Salman Rushdie. People had accused him of behaving badly a few years previously when Coetzee had won, but he liked Carey, and liked the book, and was grace itself.\" The prize elevated Carey to the front rank of writers and soon after he moved to New York. The typical story of clever Australians leaving to succeed? \"Not really,\" says Carey. It was the generation before him that had to leave to have a career - Clive James, Germaine Greer. \"You can date it quite precisely by the fact that they left by ship. There was nothing for them in that Australia, but for me it wasn't so bad. The early 70s had been a heady time for those on the left. The Labour government quickly recognised China and withdrew from Vietnam. People started coming home, as opposed to emigrating. In the arts, there were opportunities.\" Which begs the question: why did he move? \"Partly because it was possible,\" he says. \"But I admit I never imagined it would go on this long. I used to say that coming here was a moral holiday. Then my son said to me one day that 'we bombed Iraq'. And I said, hang on a minute 'they' bombed Iraq, not us. But it made me think. I have two American kids. But I'm still having a good time and my wife works in the theatre here. Sooner or later, we will go, but I've stopped worrying about it.\" Hermione Lee notes that Alison Summers plays an important part in his work. Carey thanks her for her \"flawless dramatic instinct\" in the acknowledgments for the latest book. \"The fact she is a theatre director is crucial. His work is very dramatic and theatrical. He has a strong sense for a scene. In Ned Kelly there is a lot of dressing up, for instance, and Jack Maggs was a very theatrical novel. It's an important thing that comes out of that relationship.\" When his next novel, The Tax Inspector, was published in 1991, Carey says it was \"cutting-down-tall-poppy time\". It is a bleak tale featuring violence and incest. \"Everyone in Australia thought it was so dark because I lived in New York,\" he says, \"but it grew out of Sydney. And this time they didn't choose, as they had with Illywhacker, to ignore what it criticised about Australia and take on what it celebrated.\" Caryl Phillips, who lives part of the year in New York, says that the city has \"freed him [Carey] from the critical scrutiny of Australia.

      "bodyText": "Autonomy, the FTSE 100-listed Cambridge software developer, yesterday moved to distinguish itself from a swath of ill-starred internet businesses in an effort to stem the decline in its share price. In a short statement to the market, it said: \"We have not experienced a slow-down in our overall revenue growth... Demand remains strong for Autonomy's products amongst a current and potential customer base.\" The chief executive, Mike Lynch, said that 95% of the company's business was in providing database software to established and profitable bluechip clients including British Aerospace, Lucent, News Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline and Barclays. He said investment in internet-related business made up the remaining 5%. Autonomy was expected to continue to record a growth rate of 20% to 25%, and had $130m in cash in its accounts, he said. \"There has been a lot of guilt by association, a lot of rumours in the market about Autonomy slowing down, which is completely untrue, so rather exceptionally we have taken the step of putting out a statement clarifying this,\" Dr Lynch said. Shares in Autonomy surged 225p on the back of the announcement - making it the highest climber in the FTSE 100 index - despite no facts or figures from the company. On Thursday, Autonomy's share price fell 7% after an analyst at ABN Amro drew a comparison with Inktomi, a US technology firm which had issued a profit warning. This prompted Dr Lynch to issue yesterday's statement. Autonomy's share price had fallen from about \u00a341 in November. Darren Lauber, a technologies analyst at WestLB Panmure, said: \"The slow-down in the US, and particularly in companies' IT budgets, has panicked the market. \"But Mike Lynch is right to draw a distinction.

Regency on the outside, much younger on the inside. </p> <p><strong> What are the rooms like?</strong> Split level and clever layout made ours, the Studio, feel like a stylish four-room apartment, with a lounge, sleeping area, dressing room and bathroom. Period features include fire-place and floor-to-ceiling windows, while all 29 rooms come with mod-cons such as satellite TV, CD player and mini-bar. </p> <p><strong> The bed test:</strong> The best thing is sleeping between acres of crisp cotton sheets.

      "body": "<p><strong> A good scar</strong><br> </p> <p> He was in so deep a coma that I didn't bother using local anaesthetic when I sutured the wound in his face. It was Sunday afternoon in the ICU, and I had been called in from home to close the man's lacerations. The night before, on a dark road, he had gone through the windshield. </p> <p>It was really a job for a plastic surgeon. The wound extended from the top of his scalp deep into the tissues around his eye, then down his cheek into his mouth. I knew why they had called me, the intern. The man was not expected to live. </p> <p>I did my best, matching up the creases of his skin, easing the bright half-moon of the needle in and out, daubing away the dark blood that rose in little balls from the needle-point, tying my knots like a fly fisherman. The thermostat in the room was turned up all the way, but he was cold - I could feel it through my gloves. After a while, his face began to lose distinction to me. The wound stood out, became an entity unto itself. The earlier intimacy I had felt - bending over him as he lay there, my breath all around him - began to recede into the task. </p> <p>It took hours, my back aching, my scrubs damp under my blue gown in the heat. The only sound was the regular hiss of the ventilator. The soft brown skin around his eye was like a child's; his eye looked straight up, the pupil never moving, even as I tented his eyelid, trying hard not to slip the point of the needle into the eye itself. When I had finished, my hands shaking, I stopped, straightened, stepped away from the bed. He lay muffled in blankets, and it was only then that I saw, in the hollow between his knees, a single eagle feather and a small plastic bag full of yellow pollen, left by his family to save him. </p> <p>The next morning I came back to check my work. His face looked whole; only the thin blue lines of nylon sutures betrayed the extent of his wound. It was only after at least a minute of admiring the job that I realised that the sound of the ventilator, my constant companion in the room the day before, was absent, and that the man was dead. </p> <p><strong> Sunday morning</strong><br> </p> <p> We had a few minutes of calm, waiting in our gowns and gloves, our heavy lead aprons, as the radio filled the trauma room. A pickup truck, high-speed rollover, two coming in. Teenagers. </p> <p>The black boy, who came in first, was dead. He lay unmoving, eyes half-open, with a clear plastic tube sticking out of his mouth, the paramedics still squeezing air into it through a blue rubber bag. </p> <p>\"He's in asystole,\" the paramedic said, meaning his heart was not beating. As I turned away, I noticed his hair, cascading to his shoulders, dark and shining, each strand braided and tied with red and green beads. It was the labour of hours. </p> <p>The white boy was still alive, and the room changed for me; the silence on the far side, by the still gurney, instantly faded. They wheeled him in, and it began: the IV needles into his arms, the sudden, astonishing red of the blood spilled from them on the floor, the monitor wires to his chest, voices rising, the room suddenly full of noise and speed. </p> <p>He was blue, barely breathing. I took the laryngoscope, put the blade into his mouth, and immediately felt how deeply unconscious he was, how soft and unresisting the muscles were. I lifted his tongue and jaw and saw, very clearly, his vocal cords, a neat triangle, like two white glittering sticks. It was easy to pass the tube past them into his lungs. The oxygen flowed, and his face turned slowly pink, alive again. He was big and strong, with earrings in each ear, the sides of his head shaved, his brush cut dyed blond, curly and full of clotted blood. </p> <p>It was only a few minutes later, after the X-rays and calls to the blood bank, that I felt the back of his head. It was soft, and warm, and when I withdrew my hand it was covered with blood and grey tissue. The back of his head had been crushed. By that time I knew his name - John. </p> <p>The clerk tapped me on the shoulder. \"John's family is in the consultation room,\" she said. \"Will you go talk to them?\" </p> <p>I knocked on the door, stepped inside. All eyes turned. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, stiff, uneasy. \"John is critically injured. The neuro-surgeon is seeing him now.\" </p> <p>\"How bad is it?\" the mother asked, half rising from her chair. </p> <p>\"It's bad,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. I think you should be prepared for the worst.\" </p> <p>She sat back down. \"This isn't happening,\" she said to herself, softly. \"This can't be happening.\" </p> <p>\"Is Keith dead?\" the father asked. \"We heard that Keith might be dead. Is that true?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"Keith is dead.\" </p> <p>The room erupted - life in the presence of great damage, the overweight, middle-aged mother standing to weep in her husband's arms, the husband looking into the distance over my shoulder, at the white hospital wall. In the corners, a younger brother and sister, still children, began to cry. </p> <p>\"I'm very sorry,\" I said, knowing that anything I might say to them now would be simply sounds from a great distance. </p> <p>\"He was staying with us,\" the father said. \"He was John's best friend. They were driving back from the lake. They must have fallen asleep.\" </p> <p>Then, later, \"His family is in Colorado.\" </p> <p>I nodded. John's father looked up at me. \"Can I see Keith?\" he asked. </p> <p>He was perhaps 40, white, with long hair, tattoos on his arms, wearing a muscle shirt. As I led him back to the trauma room where Keith's body lay, I saw that goosebumps had risen on his arms and legs and he was shaking. </p> <p>The room was clean, all of the earlier frenzy gone, blood mopped up, everything back in place. The nurses had covered Keith's body with clean sheets so that only his face was visible, the clear plastic tube still sticking out of his mouth, and the amazing luxuriance of his hair. He looked almost unharmed. I stood in the doorway and let the man approach on his own. </p> <p>He walked up to the body and stood for long seconds. \"This is him,\" he said. \"This is really him.\" </p> <p>He fumbled under the sheet for the boy's hand. Then he bent down, his long, brown hair falling into the boy's face, and kissed him on the forehead. </p> <p>It suddenly seemed very important that I look closely, as closely as I could, at this man taking on for the moment the role of the father to the dead son, kissing him softly, holding his hand, then turning back to me and the doorway. </p> <p><strong> Needle</strong><br> </p> <p> I was walking past X-ray on my way back to the emergency room. The door to one of the X-ray suites was open, and, glancing inside, I saw a surgery resident I knew peering anxiously at a patient's monitor. Even from the door I could see what it said: blood pressure 60/40. Heart rate 130. </p> <p>\"What's up?\" I asked. The surgery resident turned. </p> <p>\"He's an MVA from the trauma room. We had to intubate him because he was so combative, but the CAT scans of his head and belly were normal. He's only got leg fractures - but his pressure just dropped.\" </p> <p>The patient was a young man, heavily sedated, on the ventilator. He was very pale. There were three of us in the X-ray suite - the nurse, the surgery resident and me - and in the half-dark of the room we looked at each other. Something was happening. Stepping up to him, I put my stethoscope against his chest. Each mechanical breath filled his right lung, with a faint whooshing sound, like feathers brushed across a rough surface. His left lung, though, was nearly silent. As I listened, the surgery resident opened the IV fluids wide, squeezing the bags in his hands to increase the flow. </p> <p>\"Let's get a chest X-ray,\" I said. \"He's already on the table, and his pressure just came up a bit.\" </p> <p>We spent a few anxious moments, watching his blood pressure, waiting for the film to be developed. The X-ray was still warm when we held it up to the light, and there it was: the left lung punctured, crumpled like a wet handkerchief, leaking air into the chest cavity, compressing the heart and the good lung. It was a classic, the kind that killed you in minutes: a tension pneumothorax. </p> <p>I found myself sprinting down the hallway to the ER for a needle and syringe, fumbling in a drawer, turning, rushing back as patients and nurses stared at me. I felt like an actor in a melodrama, cutting around people with a needle in my hand, my white coat trailing behind me like a cape. </p> <p>The man was ashen when I got to him, and I simply stuck the needle straight into his chest. Air hissed out of him like a bicycle tyre, in little bubbles of bloody froth. I took the 60cc syringe, attached it to the needle that was quivering between his ribs, and sucked. Then I detached the syringe, pushed the air out of it, and did it again - once, twice, four times, until the pull met resistance and the air was gone, the lung plump and full once more. </p> <p>It was as dramatic an act as any I was likely to accomplish again, blood pressure rising to normal, heart rate falling to normal, all of us breathing hard. Almost as an afterthought, I realised that I had saved him, that he was alive because of me. </p> <p>Late that night, after my shift, I went to see him in the ICU. He was already off the ventilator and breathing on his own, waking up, coming back, making dim animal noises through a haze of morphine and Valium. I knew that he would leave whole, and I sat there in the dark for a while, watching the red and blue lights of the monitor, savouring him, taking something for myself. </p> <p><strong> A difference of opinion</strong><br> </p> <p> \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending said every morning when we reached room six. We expected the remark. The intern would begin the presentation, and it was always the same. </p> <p>\"This is ICU day 28 for Mr Johnson, a 26-year-old cowboy with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure and anaemia ...\" A detailed analysis of each problem, in descending order of severity, then ensued. He was growing steadily worse. The ventilator had been at maximum settings for weeks, supplying the man's ruined lungs with just enough oxygen to ensure another identical presentation the next morning. </p> <p>\"This is ICU day 29 for Mr Johnson ...\" </p> <p>\"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending would say, and we would move on, halfway through rounds and already worn out. </p> <p>Mr Johnson was a bullrider, thrown at a local rodeo, who had broken several ribs. He'd gotten up, dusted himself off, gone home, and over a few days he had developed pneumonia in his injured lung. His family brought him in nearly unconscious, with both lungs full of pus, and over the ensuing weeks his other organs also failed: liver, kidneys, intestines. Mr Johnson lay drowning in his own fluid, the fever unrelenting, his family gathering and staring at him. Over the past few days they had stopped coming, consigning him, it seemed, to his fate alone. </p> <p>One night, more than a month into his stay, I was on call when his blood pressure began dropping yet again. The intern and I stood looking at him, swollen like a toad on the ventilator. He always tormented us like this. </p> <p>\"Give him some more fluids,\" I said. \"And let's go up on his dopamine.\" The nurse sighed; she'd heard all this before. </p> <p>Listening to the ragged sounds of his lungs, I thought something had changed. His left lung sounded a bit quieter than it had the night before, an ominous sign. </p> <p>\"All right,\" I said, resigned. \"Let's get a chest X-ray.\" </p> <p>The chest X-ray had not changed much. Looking hard, though, the radiology resident thought he saw a slight difference on the left. \"Could be a pneumo,\" he said, \"though I'm not sure. Let's get a CAT scan.\" </p> <p>He referred to the possibility that air was leaking out of a hole in the lung, collapsing it. The treatment for this is minor surgery, done at the bedside. You cut into the chest between two ribs, insert a finger into the chest cavity, and push the lung out of the way. Then you slide a long plastic tube between the lung and the chest wall. </p> <p>When suction is applied through the tube, air and blood rush out, allowing the lung to re-expand. Mr Johnson had been the victim of this procedure so often that his chest was a mass of wounds that refused to heal and oozed blood-tinged fluid into the bedding. </p> <p>The intern and I looked at each other, shaking our heads. This meant hours of work, wheeling him with his ventilator and multiple IV drips down to the CAT scanner, waiting for the scan to be read, then putting in the chest tube and getting X-rays to make sure we'd done it right. Any chance of sleeping that night vanished. It was already early morning, and we were tired. \"Looks like a pneumo, all right,\" the radiologist said, pointing to the dark mass of air visible on the CAT scan. \"A pretty big one. I'm surprised we didn't see it better on the X-ray.\" </p> <p>Mr Johnson's lung, by the time I finally cut down to it through the deep, soggy tissues of his chest wall, felt exactly like a piece of cork. It was stiff, as if already embalmed. \"You've got to check this out,\" I said to the intern. \"Put on some gloves and feel this thing.\" </p> <p>For a few moments he felt around with his finger, then withdrew it, covered with blood, and held it instinctively up in the air. \"Feels like a piece of meat,\" he said. </p> <p>The next morning we were reprimanded. \"I think we should seriously consider the ethics of performing such aggressive procedures in this man,\" the attending began. \"I should have been called. It's high time, in fact, that we considered withdrawing support altogether.\" </p> <p>There was a long silence. \"He's a young guy,\" I protested. \"And we've done it before. And it helped.\" This was only marginally true. His blood pressure had come up slightly, but it was hard to know why. </p> <p>About this time, another attending came on the service, and for the next few weeks he alternated call nights with his colleague. He had different views. \"This is a young man,\" he would say when we reached room 6. \"This is exactly the kind of patient we should be most aggressive with.\" </p> <p>A bizarre dynamic developed. On even days we did almost nothing, checked no lab work, stopped antibiotics and tube feeds, and nodded solemnly as the attending shook his head and said things like, \"The most important thing we can do now is keep this man comfortable.\" </p> <p>On odd days it was the full-court press. We worked to undo the previous inactivity, checking arterial blood gases, blood cultures and X-rays, adding antibiotics and fluids, tinkering with the ventilator. </p> <p>We nodded solemnly as the attending said things like, \"This man deserves everything we can give him.\" </p> <p>This went on for more than a week, until my tenure in the ICU came to an end and I rotated back to the emergency room, leaving my nightly struggles with Mr Johnson behind. I was glad; he had unfailingly robbed me of sleep, and I had come to dread him. I knew him intimately, had examined him dozens of times, turned him over to look at his back, put my gloved finger in his mouth, in his rectum, into the interior of his chest cavity, and I had never once exchanged a single word with him. </p> <p>He was gone from the waking world, as nearly dead as a human being can be, lying at the edge but never quite crossing over, his body, his animal self just strong, or not strong, enough. I had hoped many times that he would die. </p> <p>About six months later, I was walking down the long hall back to the ER from the cafeteria. It was mid-afternoon, a slow day. The door to the pulmonary clinic was open as I passed. A few patients sat in plastic chairs, waiting for their appointments. In one corner, leaning casually against the wall, a man stood reading a newspaper. The paper obscured his face, but as he turned the page I saw it, and I stopped immediately. I felt a strong and sudden force. It took me a few seconds: I knew the man, I knew his face was signicant, but I didn't know why. Then I realised, disbelieving. </p> <p>\"Mr Johnson?\" I asked tentatively, stepping in through the clinic door. </p> <p>He looked up at me from his newspaper. </p> <p>\"Are you Mr Johnson?\" I asked, beginning to feel foolish. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Do I know you?\" </p> <p><strong> The secret</strong><br> </p> <p> \"You have to come and see this,\" the nurse said breathlessly, interrupting rounds. \"It's the grossest thing I ever saw.\" </p> <p>It was early on Sunday morning, and the trauma team had been shuffling around the surgical ICU for an hour, trying to impose some order on the carnage of the night before. It was a blur for me by then, a stream of wounds and bodies. There had been only two surgery residents and me, and we had been going for 24 hours straight, trying not to miss something big. I felt jumpy, distant from the world, and the bright, white coats and accusing fingers of the surgery attendings seemed like the fixtures of dreams. </p> <p>I heard myself answering questions, searching my note-cards, I felt numbers emerging from my mouth, but I wasn't really there. I could smell the odour of my body rising from my scrubs, and my feet felt loose and wet in my running shoes. But she got my attention, anyway. She got everybody's. The grossest thing she ever saw ... </p> <p>Her patient lay in his darkened room, heavily sedated on the ventilator. After two weeks, he was getting better, and for the past few days we had all virtually ignored him. A young man, drunk, in his car, the same story again, coming slowly back into the world. </p> <p>\"Watch,\" the nurse said, lifting the ashlight from the bedclothes. We gathered around the bed. With her left hand she moved the clear plastic ventilator tube to the side of the man's mouth, then carefully inserted her fingers between his front teeth and spread them apart. His jaw opened slackly, and she shone the light directly into his mouth. </p> <p>His mouth was like a little pink cave. Inside were dozens of tiny white worms. As we watched, they began to move, to retreat into the darker recesses, away from the light, and in a few seconds they were gone. </p> <p>\"Oh my God,\" one of the residents said. \"They're maggots. He's got maggots in his mouth.\" The room erupted. We were horried, but also excited, exhaustion washed away. He was alive, and we made her do it again. </p> <p>We took turns, switching off the light for a minute or two until the maggots came back, then illuminating them, transxed by their retreat into the dark. </p> <p>\"What we need to do,\" Dr Whistler said, chortling, \"is get a piece of bacon on a string and leave it in his mouth for a while. I've seen this before. This is why we don't like flies in the ICU.\" </p> <p>One of the medical students went down to the cafeteria for the bacon, and before long the news had spread throughout the hospital. Nurses and medical students and residents from other services began filing through his room until finally the charge nurse put a stop to it. \"This isn't a sideshow,\" she said, to settle the matter. </p> <p>Tied to a string, raw and shiny with fat, the bacon worked beautifully. The nurse pulled it out every half hour or so, and each time it was alive with maggots. She wiped them off, dropped them into a bottle of alcohol, then replaced the bacon. \"It's like fishing,\" she said, chuckling, shaking her head. </p> <p>A month or so later, in the trauma clinic, I saw him again, stiff, thin, walking slowly with his cane. The nurse called his name, and he came slowly forward to the desk. </p> <p>We sat a few feet away, and as he stood writing his name on the forms, weak and alive, we whispered: \"That's the maggot man. Remember him? He's right over there.\" </p> <p>No one had told him a thing. </p> <p><strong> Sugar</strong><br> </p> <p> The little girl was running around the room, screeching happily, and when she saw me she hid under the bed. I could see her peering at me from between the legs of the gurney as I stood with her chart in my hand. Her father shook his head, grinned, and looked at his wife. \"I told you there's nothing wrong with her.\" </p> <p>I looked down at the chart. On it the triage nurse had written, in bold black letters, \"Two-year-old acting weird.\" </p> <p>\"I'm Dr Huyler. What can I do for you?\" </p> <p>\"Nothing,\" he said, and his wife hushed him. </p> <p>\"She's not acting right,\" she said. She wore an African print dress, and I found myself staring at the intricate pattern of swirling reds and browns. Her hair was cornrowed, a bead at the end of each strand. </p> <p>\"They're Medicaid,\" the triage nurse had whispered pointedly in my ear. The implication was clear: they wanted something for free. Tylenol, a work excuse. But it was 10 o'clock on a Friday night. </p> <p>\"What has she been doing?\" </p> <p>\"It's kind of hard to explain. She just isn't acting herself. I noticed it right away. But she's been fine ever since we got here.\" </p> <p>\"Can you be more specic?\" I could feel myself getting impatient. There were half a dozen patients waiting, the ER was full. I wondered why they hadn't called their regular paediatrician. </p> <p>\"Well,\" she said, thinking, \"you know how people look when they're staring into a mirror? Kind of blank?\" I nodded. \"She's like that. Only there isn't a mirror. There's nothing there.\" </p> <p>The child's vital signs were completely normal. Her mother coaxed her out from under the bed and held her wriggling in her arms as I listened to her heart and lungs, looked into her ears. I'm uneasy with children. I must have been a cold, white form to her, large, bending down with my stethoscope and light. I could see nothing wrong with her. She looked impeccably cared for, without any sign of the abuse I had been vaguely and secretly considering. I always do. It's been drummed into us. </p> <p>\"Does she have any medical problems at all?\" </p> <p>\"No,\" her father said, anticipating my questions. \"She's always been healthy. She's had all her shots. She's growing like she should, and she can talk a little, only now she won't 'cause she's shy.\" He wagged a finger, and she giggled, hiding her face with the bottle her mother had given her. </p> <p>\"Has she had any recent stress, something that might have upset her?\" </p> <p>They looked at each other. \"I don't think so.\" </p> <p>\"Is there a history of seizures in the family?\" </p> <p>Her mother thought for a while. \"I think my brother might have seizures,\" she said finally, \"but I haven't seen him in a long time.\" </p> <p>\"And right now she's acting normally?\" </p> <p>\"She's fine,\" her father said to his wife. \"Come on, let's go. If she does it again we'll come back. It's past her bedtime.\" </p> <p>I considered what I'd heard. A vague history of blank spells; it could mean anything, from a rare type of seizure to the vagaries of the two-year-old mind. She could see her paediatrician on Monday, I thought. She was a completely normal child. On my way out the door, though, I turned around. \"Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medications? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?\" </p> <p>\"Well, she stays with my mother when we're at work. She takes medicines.\" </p> <p>\"What kind of medicine does she take?\" </p> <p>\"I'm not sure. Something for her blood pressure and a sugar pill.\" </p> <p>Oral hypoglycemics - sugar pills - are among the most dangerous of overdoses. They can drop blood sugar profoundly, cause brain damage, seizures, coma. Designed for adult diabetics, they are long-lasting, and one pill could kill a small child, even many hours later. </p> <p>\"Let's check her blood sugar,\" I said, \"just to be sure. And please call your mother, find out exactly what she takes.\" </p> <p>From the doctor's station I could hear the child shrieking as the nurse drew her blood. Her mother spoke into the phone a few feet away. \"My mother takes glipizide,\" she said, handing me a piece of paper where she'd written it down. \"She ran out of her blood pressure medicine two weeks ago.\" </p> <p>A sugar pill. </p> <p>The nurse came out of the room with a syringe full of blood. The child's mother and I watched as she eased a single drop from the tip of the needle onto the portable blood-sugar machine she held in her hand. It digested the blood for a few seconds, then displayed the number on the screen. Forty-two. </p> <p>\"Is that low?\" her mother asked. </p> <p>\"It's about half of what it should be,\" I replied, stunned. \"She must have taken one of your mother's sugar pills.\" </p> <p>\"My mother is legally blind. She probably dropped one and didn't notice.\" </p> <p>\"We need to keep her in the hospital for at least a day and give her sugar intravenously.\" I said it quietly, half to myself. </p> <p>\"Will she be all right?\" She was afraid, staring at me. </p> <p>\"She'll be fine.\" And suddenly I began to shake. \"But I'm very glad you brought her in. You may have saved her life.\" </p> <p>\"My husband wanted to put her to bed,\" she said softly, looking off down the hall. </p> <p>It was suddenly clear. Sometime that afternoon, the girl had taken the pill, and by the time her parents came home she was showing the effects of low blood sugar: the staring spells, the blank look. </p> <p>\"What did you do when you saw she was acting weird?\" </p> <p>\"We gave her a bottle,\" the father said, standing with us now. \"And then we gave her a sucker.\" </p> <p>They had given her sugar. When she arrived in the ER, her blood sugar had risen enough for her to look and act herself, but it wouldn't have lasted long. Later that night, when the whole family was asleep, it would have fallen again, and she might never have woken up. </p> <p>As I watched the girl skip and jump around us, the pain of the needle forgotten already, I felt sick, cold and damp, terried by what I had almost missed. One question, an afterthought. That was all it had been. </p> <p>From time to time I think about her. I imagine her playing in parks, jumping on the couch, shrieking in the bathtub. I imagine her head teeming with small thoughts, and the motion of her hands, her eyes, alive in the world, going out into it, entering it, decade after decade ahead. </p> <p> \u00a9 Frank Huyler. </p> <p> \u0095 This is an edited extract from The Blood Of Strangers, by Frank Huyler, published by 4th Estate at \u00a310.</p> <p>Read an interview with Frank Huyler <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,6000,418381,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A good scar He was in so deep a coma that I didn't bother using local anaesthetic when I sutured the wound in his face. It was Sunday afternoon in the ICU, and I had been called in from home to close the man's lacerations. The night before, on a dark road, he had gone through the windshield. It was really a job for a plastic surgeon. The wound extended from the top of his scalp deep into the tissues around his eye, then down his cheek into his mouth. I knew why they had called me, the intern. The man was not expected to live. I did my best, matching up the creases of his skin, easing the bright half-moon of the needle in and out, daubing away the dark blood that rose in little balls from the needle-point, tying my knots like a fly fisherman. The thermostat in the room was turned up all the way, but he was cold - I could feel it through my gloves. After a while, his face began to lose distinction to me. The wound stood out, became an entity unto itself. The earlier intimacy I had felt - bending over him as he lay there, my breath all around him - began to recede into the task. It took hours, my back aching, my scrubs damp under my blue gown in the heat. The only sound was the regular hiss of the ventilator. The soft brown skin around his eye was like a child's; his eye looked straight up, the pupil never moving, even as I tented his eyelid, trying hard not to slip the point of the needle into the eye itself. When I had finished, my hands shaking, I stopped, straightened, stepped away from the bed. He lay muffled in blankets, and it was only then that I saw, in the hollow between his knees, a single eagle feather and a small plastic bag full of yellow pollen, left by his family to save him. The next morning I came back to check my work. His face looked whole; only the thin blue lines of nylon sutures betrayed the extent of his wound. It was only after at least a minute of admiring the job that I realised that the sound of the ventilator, my constant companion in the room the day before, was absent, and that the man was dead. Sunday morning We had a few minutes of calm, waiting in our gowns and gloves, our heavy lead aprons, as the radio filled the trauma room. A pickup truck, high-speed rollover, two coming in. Teenagers. The black boy, who came in first, was dead. He lay unmoving, eyes half-open, with a clear plastic tube sticking out of his mouth, the paramedics still squeezing air into it through a blue rubber bag. \"He's in asystole,\" the paramedic said, meaning his heart was not beating. As I turned away, I noticed his hair, cascading to his shoulders, dark and shining, each strand braided and tied with red and green beads. It was the labour of hours. The white boy was still alive, and the room changed for me; the silence on the far side, by the still gurney, instantly faded. They wheeled him in, and it began: the IV needles into his arms, the sudden, astonishing red of the blood spilled from them on the floor, the monitor wires to his chest, voices rising, the room suddenly full of noise and speed. He was blue, barely breathing. I took the laryngoscope, put the blade into his mouth, and immediately felt how deeply unconscious he was, how soft and unresisting the muscles were. I lifted his tongue and jaw and saw, very clearly, his vocal cords, a neat triangle, like two white glittering sticks. It was easy to pass the tube past them into his lungs. The oxygen flowed, and his face turned slowly pink, alive again. He was big and strong, with earrings in each ear, the sides of his head shaved, his brush cut dyed blond, curly and full of clotted blood. It was only a few minutes later, after the X-rays and calls to the blood bank, that I felt the back of his head. It was soft, and warm, and when I withdrew my hand it was covered with blood and grey tissue. The back of his head had been crushed. By that time I knew his name - John. The clerk tapped me on the shoulder. \"John's family is in the consultation room,\" she said. \"Will you go talk to them?\" I knocked on the door, stepped inside. All eyes turned. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, stiff, uneasy. \"John is critically injured. The neuro-surgeon is seeing him now.\" \"How bad is it?\" the mother asked, half rising from her chair. \"It's bad,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. I think you should be prepared for the worst.\" She sat back down. \"This isn't happening,\" she said to herself, softly. \"This can't be happening.\" \"Is Keith dead?\" the father asked. \"We heard that Keith might be dead. Is that true?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Keith is dead.\" The room erupted - life in the presence of great damage, the overweight, middle-aged mother standing to weep in her husband's arms, the husband looking into the distance over my shoulder, at the white hospital wall. In the corners, a younger brother and sister, still children, began to cry. \"I'm very sorry,\" I said, knowing that anything I might say to them now would be simply sounds from a great distance. \"He was staying with us,\" the father said. \"He was John's best friend. They were driving back from the lake. They must have fallen asleep.\" Then, later, \"His family is in Colorado.\" I nodded. John's father looked up at me. \"Can I see Keith?\" he asked. He was perhaps 40, white, with long hair, tattoos on his arms, wearing a muscle shirt. As I led him back to the trauma room where Keith's body lay, I saw that goosebumps had risen on his arms and legs and he was shaking. The room was clean, all of the earlier frenzy gone, blood mopped up, everything back in place. The nurses had covered Keith's body with clean sheets so that only his face was visible, the clear plastic tube still sticking out of his mouth, and the amazing luxuriance of his hair. He looked almost unharmed. I stood in the doorway and let the man approach on his own. He walked up to the body and stood for long seconds. \"This is him,\" he said. \"This is really him.\" He fumbled under the sheet for the boy's hand. Then he bent down, his long, brown hair falling into the boy's face, and kissed him on the forehead. It suddenly seemed very important that I look closely, as closely as I could, at this man taking on for the moment the role of the father to the dead son, kissing him softly, holding his hand, then turning back to me and the doorway. Needle I was walking past X-ray on my way back to the emergency room. The door to one of the X-ray suites was open, and, glancing inside, I saw a surgery resident I knew peering anxiously at a patient's monitor. Even from the door I could see what it said: blood pressure 60/40. Heart rate 130. \"What's up?\" I asked. The surgery resident turned. \"He's an MVA from the trauma room. We had to intubate him because he was so combative, but the CAT scans of his head and belly were normal. He's only got leg fractures - but his pressure just dropped.\" The patient was a young man, heavily sedated, on the ventilator. He was very pale. There were three of us in the X-ray suite - the nurse, the surgery resident and me - and in the half-dark of the room we looked at each other. Something was happening. Stepping up to him, I put my stethoscope against his chest. Each mechanical breath filled his right lung, with a faint whooshing sound, like feathers brushed across a rough surface. His left lung, though, was nearly silent. As I listened, the surgery resident opened the IV fluids wide, squeezing the bags in his hands to increase the flow. \"Let's get a chest X-ray,\" I said. \"He's already on the table, and his pressure just came up a bit.\" We spent a few anxious moments, watching his blood pressure, waiting for the film to be developed. The X-ray was still warm when we held it up to the light, and there it was: the left lung punctured, crumpled like a wet handkerchief, leaking air into the chest cavity, compressing the heart and the good lung. It was a classic, the kind that killed you in minutes: a tension pneumothorax. I found myself sprinting down the hallway to the ER for a needle and syringe, fumbling in a drawer, turning, rushing back as patients and nurses stared at me. I felt like an actor in a melodrama, cutting around people with a needle in my hand, my white coat trailing behind me like a cape. The man was ashen when I got to him, and I simply stuck the needle straight into his chest. Air hissed out of him like a bicycle tyre, in little bubbles of bloody froth. I took the 60cc syringe, attached it to the needle that was quivering between his ribs, and sucked. Then I detached the syringe, pushed the air out of it, and did it again - once, twice, four times, until the pull met resistance and the air was gone, the lung plump and full once more. It was as dramatic an act as any I was likely to accomplish again, blood pressure rising to normal, heart rate falling to normal, all of us breathing hard. Almost as an afterthought, I realised that I had saved him, that he was alive because of me. Late that night, after my shift, I went to see him in the ICU. He was already off the ventilator and breathing on his own, waking up, coming back, making dim animal noises through a haze of morphine and Valium. I knew that he would leave whole, and I sat there in the dark for a while, watching the red and blue lights of the monitor, savouring him, taking something for myself. A difference of opinion \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending said every morning when we reached room six. We expected the remark. The intern would begin the presentation, and it was always the same. \"This is ICU day 28 for Mr Johnson, a 26-year-old cowboy with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure and anaemia ...\" A detailed analysis of each problem, in descending order of severity, then ensued. He was growing steadily worse. The ventilator had been at maximum settings for weeks, supplying the man's ruined lungs with just enough oxygen to ensure another identical presentation the next morning. \"This is ICU day 29 for Mr Johnson ...\" \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending would say, and we would move on, halfway through rounds and already worn out. Mr Johnson was a bullrider, thrown at a local rodeo, who had broken several ribs. He'd gotten up, dusted himself off, gone home, and over a few days he had developed pneumonia in his injured lung. His family brought him in nearly unconscious, with both lungs full of pus, and over the ensuing weeks his other organs also failed: liver, kidneys, intestines. Mr Johnson lay drowning in his own fluid, the fever unrelenting, his family gathering and staring at him. Over the past few days they had stopped coming, consigning him, it seemed, to his fate alone. One night, more than a month into his stay, I was on call when his blood pressure began dropping yet again. The intern and I stood looking at him, swollen like a toad on the ventilator. He always tormented us like this. \"Give him some more fluids,\" I said. \"And let's go up on his dopamine.\" The nurse sighed; she'd heard all this before. Listening to the ragged sounds of his lungs, I thought something had changed. His left lung sounded a bit quieter than it had the night before, an ominous sign. \"All right,\" I said, resigned. \"Let's get a chest X-ray.\" The chest X-ray had not changed much. Looking hard, though, the radiology resident thought he saw a slight difference on the left. \"Could be a pneumo,\" he said, \"though I'm not sure. Let's get a CAT scan.\" He referred to the possibility that air was leaking out of a hole in the lung, collapsing it. The treatment for this is minor surgery, done at the bedside. You cut into the chest between two ribs, insert a finger into the chest cavity, and push the lung out of the way. Then you slide a long plastic tube between the lung and the chest wall. When suction is applied through the tube, air and blood rush out, allowing the lung to re-expand. Mr Johnson had been the victim of this procedure so often that his chest was a mass of wounds that refused to heal and oozed blood-tinged fluid into the bedding. The intern and I looked at each other, shaking our heads. This meant hours of work, wheeling him with his ventilator and multiple IV drips down to the CAT scanner, waiting for the scan to be read, then putting in the chest tube and getting X-rays to make sure we'd done it right. Any chance of sleeping that night vanished. It was already early morning, and we were tired. \"Looks like a pneumo, all right,\" the radiologist said, pointing to the dark mass of air visible on the CAT scan. \"A pretty big one. I'm surprised we didn't see it better on the X-ray.\" Mr Johnson's lung, by the time I finally cut down to it through the deep, soggy tissues of his chest wall, felt exactly like a piece of cork. It was stiff, as if already embalmed. \"You've got to check this out,\" I said to the intern. \"Put on some gloves and feel this thing.\" For a few moments he felt around with his finger, then withdrew it, covered with blood, and held it instinctively up in the air. \"Feels like a piece of meat,\" he said. The next morning we were reprimanded. \"I think we should seriously consider the ethics of performing such aggressive procedures in this man,\" the attending began. \"I should have been called. It's high time, in fact, that we considered withdrawing support altogether.\" There was a long silence. \"He's a young guy,\" I protested. \"And we've done it before. And it helped.\" This was only marginally true. His blood pressure had come up slightly, but it was hard to know why. About this time, another attending came on the service, and for the next few weeks he alternated call nights with his colleague. He had different views. \"This is a young man,\" he would say when we reached room 6. \"This is exactly the kind of patient we should be most aggressive with.\" A bizarre dynamic developed. On even days we did almost nothing, checked no lab work, stopped antibiotics and tube feeds, and nodded solemnly as the attending shook his head and said things like, \"The most important thing we can do now is keep this man comfortable.\" On odd days it was the full-court press. We worked to undo the previous inactivity, checking arterial blood gases, blood cultures and X-rays, adding antibiotics and fluids, tinkering with the ventilator. We nodded solemnly as the attending said things like, \"This man deserves everything we can give him.\" This went on for more than a week, until my tenure in the ICU came to an end and I rotated back to the emergency room, leaving my nightly struggles with Mr Johnson behind. I was glad; he had unfailingly robbed me of sleep, and I had come to dread him. I knew him intimately, had examined him dozens of times, turned him over to look at his back, put my gloved finger in his mouth, in his rectum, into the interior of his chest cavity, and I had never once exchanged a single word with him. He was gone from the waking world, as nearly dead as a human being can be, lying at the edge but never quite crossing over, his body, his animal self just strong, or not strong, enough. I had hoped many times that he would die. About six months later, I was walking down the long hall back to the ER from the cafeteria. It was mid-afternoon, a slow day. The door to the pulmonary clinic was open as I passed. A few patients sat in plastic chairs, waiting for their appointments. In one corner, leaning casually against the wall, a man stood reading a newspaper. The paper obscured his face, but as he turned the page I saw it, and I stopped immediately. I felt a strong and sudden force. It took me a few seconds: I knew the man, I knew his face was signicant, but I didn't know why. Then I realised, disbelieving. \"Mr Johnson?\" I asked tentatively, stepping in through the clinic door. He looked up at me from his newspaper. \"Are you Mr Johnson?\" I asked, beginning to feel foolish. \"Yes,\" he said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Do I know you?\" The secret \"You have to come and see this,\" the nurse said breathlessly, interrupting rounds. \"It's the grossest thing I ever saw.\" It was early on Sunday morning, and the trauma team had been shuffling around the surgical ICU for an hour, trying to impose some order on the carnage of the night before. It was a blur for me by then, a stream of wounds and bodies. There had been only two surgery residents and me, and we had been going for 24 hours straight, trying not to miss something big. I felt jumpy, distant from the world, and the bright, white coats and accusing fingers of the surgery attendings seemed like the fixtures of dreams. I heard myself answering questions, searching my note-cards, I felt numbers emerging from my mouth, but I wasn't really there. I could smell the odour of my body rising from my scrubs, and my feet felt loose and wet in my running shoes. But she got my attention, anyway. She got everybody's. The grossest thing she ever saw ... Her patient lay in his darkened room, heavily sedated on the ventilator. After two weeks, he was getting better, and for the past few days we had all virtually ignored him. A young man, drunk, in his car, the same story again, coming slowly back into the world. \"Watch,\" the nurse said, lifting the ashlight from the bedclothes. We gathered around the bed. With her left hand she moved the clear plastic ventilator tube to the side of the man's mouth, then carefully inserted her fingers between his front teeth and spread them apart. His jaw opened slackly, and she shone the light directly into his mouth. His mouth was like a little pink cave. Inside were dozens of tiny white worms. As we watched, they began to move, to retreat into the darker recesses, away from the light, and in a few seconds they were gone. \"Oh my God,\" one of the residents said. \"They're maggots. He's got maggots in his mouth.\" The room erupted. We were horried, but also excited, exhaustion washed away. He was alive, and we made her do it again. We took turns, switching off the light for a minute or two until the maggots came back, then illuminating them, transxed by their retreat into the dark. \"What we need to do,\" Dr Whistler said, chortling, \"is get a piece of bacon on a string and leave it in his mouth for a while. I've seen this before. This is why we don't like flies in the ICU.\" One of the medical students went down to the cafeteria for the bacon, and before long the news had spread throughout the hospital. Nurses and medical students and residents from other services began filing through his room until finally the charge nurse put a stop to it. \"This isn't a sideshow,\" she said, to settle the matter. Tied to a string, raw and shiny with fat, the bacon worked beautifully. The nurse pulled it out every half hour or so, and each time it was alive with maggots. She wiped them off, dropped them into a bottle of alcohol, then replaced the bacon. \"It's like fishing,\" she said, chuckling, shaking her head. A month or so later, in the trauma clinic, I saw him again, stiff, thin, walking slowly with his cane. The nurse called his name, and he came slowly forward to the desk. We sat a few feet away, and as he stood writing his name on the forms, weak and alive, we whispered: \"That's the maggot man. Remember him? He's right over there.\" No one had told him a thing. Sugar The little girl was running around the room, screeching happily, and when she saw me she hid under the bed. I could see her peering at me from between the legs of the gurney as I stood with her chart in my hand. Her father shook his head, grinned, and looked at his wife. \"I told you there's nothing wrong with her.\" I looked down at the chart. On it the triage nurse had written, in bold black letters, \"Two-year-old acting weird.\" \"I'm Dr Huyler. What can I do for you?\" \"Nothing,\" he said, and his wife hushed him. \"She's not acting right,\" she said. She wore an African print dress, and I found myself staring at the intricate pattern of swirling reds and browns. Her hair was cornrowed, a bead at the end of each strand. \"They're Medicaid,\" the triage nurse had whispered pointedly in my ear. The implication was clear: they wanted something for free. Tylenol, a work excuse. But it was 10 o'clock on a Friday night. \"What has she been doing?\" \"It's kind of hard to explain. She just isn't acting herself. I noticed it right away. But she's been fine ever since we got here.\" \"Can you be more specic?\" I could feel myself getting impatient. There were half a dozen patients waiting, the ER was full. I wondered why they hadn't called their regular paediatrician. \"Well,\" she said, thinking, \"you know how people look when they're staring into a mirror? Kind of blank?\" I nodded. \"She's like that. Only there isn't a mirror. There's nothing there.\" The child's vital signs were completely normal. Her mother coaxed her out from under the bed and held her wriggling in her arms as I listened to her heart and lungs, looked into her ears. I'm uneasy with children. I must have been a cold, white form to her, large, bending down with my stethoscope and light. I could see nothing wrong with her. She looked impeccably cared for, without any sign of the abuse I had been vaguely and secretly considering. I always do. It's been drummed into us. \"Does she have any medical problems at all?\" \"No,\" her father said, anticipating my questions. \"She's always been healthy. She's had all her shots. She's growing like she should, and she can talk a little, only now she won't 'cause she's shy.\" He wagged a finger, and she giggled, hiding her face with the bottle her mother had given her. \"Has she had any recent stress, something that might have upset her?\" They looked at each other. \"I don't think so.\" \"Is there a history of seizures in the family?\" Her mother thought for a while. \"I think my brother might have seizures,\" she said finally, \"but I haven't seen him in a long time.\" \"And right now she's acting normally?\" \"She's fine,\" her father said to his wife. \"Come on, let's go. If she does it again we'll come back. It's past her bedtime.\" I considered what I'd heard. A vague history of blank spells; it could mean anything, from a rare type of seizure to the vagaries of the two-year-old mind. She could see her paediatrician on Monday, I thought. She was a completely normal child. On my way out the door, though, I turned around. \"Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medications? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?\" \"Well, she stays with my mother when we're at work. She takes medicines.\" \"What kind of medicine does she take?\" \"I'm not sure. Something for her blood pressure and a sugar pill.\" Oral hypoglycemics - sugar pills - are among the most dangerous of overdoses. They can drop blood sugar profoundly, cause brain damage, seizures, coma. Designed for adult diabetics, they are long-lasting, and one pill could kill a small child, even many hours later. \"Let's check her blood sugar,\" I said, \"just to be sure. And please call your mother, find out exactly what she takes.\" From the doctor's station I could hear the child shrieking as the nurse drew her blood. Her mother spoke into the phone a few feet away. \"My mother takes glipizide,\" she said, handing me a piece of paper where she'd written it down. \"She ran out of her blood pressure medicine two weeks ago.\" A sugar pill. The nurse came out of the room with a syringe full of blood. The child's mother and I watched as she eased a single drop from the tip of the needle onto the portable blood-sugar machine she held in her hand. It digested the blood for a few seconds, then displayed the number on the screen. Forty-two. \"Is that low?\" her mother asked. \"It's about half of what it should be,\" I replied, stunned. \"She must have taken one of your mother's sugar pills.\" \"My mother is legally blind. She probably dropped one and didn't notice.\" \"We need to keep her in the hospital for at least a day and give her sugar intravenously.\" I said it quietly, half to myself. \"Will she be all right?\" She was afraid, staring at me. \"She'll be fine.\" And suddenly I began to shake. \"But I'm very glad you brought her in. You may have saved her life.\" \"My husband wanted to put her to bed,\" she said softly, looking off down the hall. It was suddenly clear. Sometime that afternoon, the girl had taken the pill, and by the time her parents came home she was showing the effects of low blood sugar: the staring spells, the blank look. \"What did you do when you saw she was acting weird?\" \"We gave her a bottle,\" the father said, standing with us now. \"And then we gave her a sucker.\" They had given her sugar. When she arrived in the ER, her blood sugar had risen enough for her to look and act herself, but it wouldn't have lasted long. Later that night, when the whole family was asleep, it would have fallen again, and she might never have woken up. As I watched the girl skip and jump around us, the pain of the needle forgotten already, I felt sick, cold and damp, terried by what I had almost missed. One question, an afterthought. That was all it had been. From time to time I think about her. I imagine her playing in parks, jumping on the couch, shrieking in the bathtub. I imagine her head teeming with small thoughts, and the motion of her hands, her eyes, alive in the world, going out into it, entering it, decade after decade ahead. \u00a9 Frank Huyler. \u0095 This is an edited extract from The Blood Of Strangers, by Frank Huyler, published by 4th Estate at \u00a310.

      "body": "<p>January can be a testing time for our finances, what with the post-Christmas credit card bills landing on doormats and the temptations of the sales. So here are two bits of good news for homeowners and those planning to buy a house this year. </p> <p>A cut in mortgage rates moved a big step closer this week after the United States slashed interest rates for the first time in two years on Wednesday. Many experts believe the decision could lead to the first UK interest rate cut since last February, and it could possibly come as early as next week, spelling lower monthly payments for millions of people who have discounted rate mortgages or who are on their lender's standard variable rate. </p> <p>Some economists went as far as to predict the UK base rate (currently 6%) would be down to 5% by the end of the year. If this happens, and the cut was passed on in full to borrowers, it would chop as much as \u00a350 off the monthly payments of someone with a \u00a360,000 loan paying the typical bank standard mortgage rate, currently 7.74%. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there is also good news if you're planning to take out a mortgage this year, either for a house purchase or because you're considering moving your home loan to another lender. All the evidence suggests the cut-throat competition in the mortgage market which raged most of last year, resulting in some cracking deals for borrowers, is set to continue. </p> <p>\"The market will maintain this competitive momentum throughout 2001, ensuring a steady stream of bargain rates for borrowers,\" predicts London-based mortgage broker Charcol. It says the best value can be found in two and three-year discounted rate deals. </p> <p>For those people looking to remortgage, the savings you can make are potentially huge. Many people could easily chop 25% off their mortgage payments in one fell swoop - perhaps \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a month, which can add up to almost \u00a35,000 over two years. While millions of homeowners are paying 7.74% there are two-year fixed rate deals available as low as 4.99%. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money asked Charcol and another mortgage broker, Bath-based London &amp; Country Mortgages, to pick out five of the best deals around at the moment. All are available both to those buying a property and people remortgaging unless it says otherwise. </p> <p><strong>Five of the best: </strong></p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> <strong> Deep discount</strong><br> The anticipated mortgage rate cuts suggest the smart money could well be going into discounted rate home loans. Britannia building society is offering a two-year discounted deal giving 2.4% off their standard mortgage rate if you can stump up a deposit of 25%-plus, or 2.3% if you can't manage a deposit that big. As their standard mortgage rate is 7.64%, that means the initial pay rate is either 5.24% or 5.34%. This deal is free of lock-in early redemp tion penalties so you can walk away at any time. There is a \u00a3195 arrangement fee to pay. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Can we fix it?</strong> <br>Many people like the security of knowing exactly what their monthly payments will be. GMAC (the loans business owned by General Motors) is offering a deal where what you pay is fixed at 5.49% for two years, until March 1 2003. It's free of redemption penalties and offers the advantage of daily interest calculation, which reduces your costs over time. But it's only available to those with a deposit of at least 25%. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Cap your costs</strong><br> The Woolwich this week launched a new range of mortgages including one where what you pay is capped at 5.35% for two years, until April 1 2003. That means you will never pay more than 5.35% during the period but if the mortgage rate falls below this, then so will what you pay. This rate is available to anyone borrowing up to 95%, and comes with the added benefits of flexible features (you can make overpayments, etc) and daily interest calculation. There are redemption penalties within the two years and there is an arrangement fee of \u00a3195. </p> <p> <strong> 4 For first-timers</strong><br> The Woolwich is also offering a competitive deal available to first-time buyers only. What you pay is capped at 5.99% for three years, until April 1 2004, and the minimum deposit is just 5%. There are redemption penalties within the three-year period but there is no arrangement fee to pay and again the deal is flexible and features daily interest. </p> <p> <strong> 5 T racker attraction</strong> <br>Tracker loans are growing in popularity. With these, the rate you pay follows the ups and downs of the Bank of England base rate. The Halifax is offering a tracker deal where you pay 0.45% below the base rate until December 31 2002, giving a current pay rate of 5.55%. This deal is for people who can manage a deposit of 25%-plus. For those who can't stump up a deposit that big, the discount off the base rate is 0.25%. The deal has no redemption penalties and there is no arrangement fee to pay. </p> <p>You might also want to consider the findings of a survey issued by financial data provider the Research Department which reveals that mutual organisations such as building societies continue to offer cheaper mortgages than most of their banking competitors. The survey looked at the total interest paid on a \u00a350,000 standard variable rate mortgage between January 1 2000 and 31 December 2000. It concluded that nine of the top 10 cheapest lenders were mutuals or owned by a mutual, if you exclude special deals and privilege rates offered to long-standing borrowers. </p> <p>Standard Life Bank - the mortgage lending arm of mutual insurer Standard Life - came top of the value-for-money table. A Standard Life Bank borrower with a \u00a350,000 interest-only loan on the standard rate would have forked out a total of \u00a33,447 in interest during 2000, says the survey. This is \u00a3414 less than the \u00a33,861 a borrower with Northern Rock would have paid, though it is only fair to point out that Northern Rock offers a lower rate to borrowers who have been with it for more than seven years. The other mutuals in the top 10 were the Nationwide, Yorkshire, Leeds &amp; Holbeck, Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Derbyshire, Portman, Chelsea and Cheshire building societies. The only high street bank to make the top 10 was HSBC. </p> <p>For many homeowners, the best financial decision they will make this year is to switch their mortgage to another lender. The number of people remortgaging has soared to a new record as awareness increases about the savings people can make by moving to another deal. </p> <p>If you're not tied into your lender's standard variable rate by lock-in early redemption penalties, you should be thinking seriously about switching. Even if there are penalties tying you in, it may still be worth paying up and moving. It's probably not going to be nearly as painful as you might imagine. Many lenders, including the Halifax, are so keen to sign up remort gage customers that they will waive many of the fees and charges. </p> <p>Remortgaging has enabled John Williams to both save money and raise some extra cash to pay for home improvements. He is borrowing an extra \u00a310,000 from his new lender, Coventry building society, and most of this is being ploughed back into his house in Chelmsford, Essex. </p> <p>The 49-year-old recruitment consultant had a two-year fixed rate mortgage with Abbey National which ran out recently, and he had the choice of paying the penalty and leaving, or sticking with the bank for the next three years on their standard variable rate. After talking to a mortgage broker Mr Williams decided to bite the bullet and switch to a two-year discounted rate loan with the Coventry. Even though he is borrowing an extra \u00a310,000, he is still saving money - his monthly payments have dropped from around \u00a3380 to \u00a3350. </p> <p>Mr Williams is planning to use the cash to pay for a new bathroom, a new front door and, if possible, wooden flooring downstairs. \"I've remortgaged a few times but this has been the easiest one. Years ago it was quite a lot of hassle but now it is all done for you. It is more slick and professional these days - I would recommend it to anyone.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "January can be a testing time for our finances, what with the post-Christmas credit card bills landing on doormats and the temptations of the sales. So here are two bits of good news for homeowners and those planning to buy a house this year. A cut in mortgage rates moved a big step closer this week after the United States slashed interest rates for the first time in two years on Wednesday. Many experts believe the decision could lead to the first UK interest rate cut since last February, and it could possibly come as early as next week, spelling lower monthly payments for millions of people who have discounted rate mortgages or who are on their lender's standard variable rate. Some economists went as far as to predict the UK base rate (currently 6%) would be down to 5% by the end of the year. If this happens, and the cut was passed on in full to borrowers, it would chop as much as \u00a350 off the monthly payments of someone with a \u00a360,000 loan paying the typical bank standard mortgage rate, currently 7.74%. Meanwhile, there is also good news if you're planning to take out a mortgage this year, either for a house purchase or because you're considering moving your home loan to another lender. All the evidence suggests the cut-throat competition in the mortgage market which raged most of last year, resulting in some cracking deals for borrowers, is set to continue. \"The market will maintain this competitive momentum throughout 2001, ensuring a steady stream of bargain rates for borrowers,\" predicts London-based mortgage broker Charcol. It says the best value can be found in two and three-year discounted rate deals. For those people looking to remortgage, the savings you can make are potentially huge. Many people could easily chop 25% off their mortgage payments in one fell swoop - perhaps \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a month, which can add up to almost \u00a35,000 over two years. While millions of homeowners are paying 7.74% there are two-year fixed rate deals available as low as 4.99%. Jobs &amp; Money asked Charcol and another mortgage broker, Bath-based London &amp; Country Mortgages, to pick out five of the best deals around at the moment. All are available both to those buying a property and people remortgaging unless it says otherwise. Five of the best: 1 Deep discount The anticipated mortgage rate cuts suggest the smart money could well be going into discounted rate home loans. Britannia building society is offering a two-year discounted deal giving 2.4% off their standard mortgage rate if you can stump up a deposit of 25%-plus, or 2.3% if you can't manage a deposit that big.

There is a \u00a3195 arrangement fee to pay. 2 Can we fix it? Many people like the security of knowing exactly what their monthly payments will be. GMAC (the loans business owned by General Motors) is offering a deal where what you pay is fixed at 5.49% for two years, until March 1 2003. It's free of redemption penalties and offers the advantage of daily interest calculation, which reduces your costs over time.

      "body": "<p>The first time I went to the Talbot Inn, the waters of the River Teme were just receding from the front doorstep. There were sandbags piled up all along the front, and the whole landscape had a pretty bedraggled look. I was there courtesy of Radio 4's Food Programme, to interview the two sisters who run the inn, Wiz and Annie Clift, about the art of pickling. They seem to pickle everything, the Clift sisters - gooseberries, damsons, walnuts, geranium buds, radish pods, tomatoes, octopus and salmon, to name but a few of the pots I dipped into. </p> <p>Anyway, come the end of a long, arduous morning at the microphone, I plonked myself down on a window seat while someone fetched a plate of braised oxtail from the kitchen. And such oxtail it was, too, fetchingly falling off the bone, the juices delicate and rich, with added pig's trotter and a couple of plump little round dumplings, as light as puff balls and musky with beef dripping, sitting comfortingly alongside. A couple of spoonfuls of the Clift's pickled damsons cut through the rum-tum-tugger of the oxtail, and a couple of pints of T'Other bitter, brewed on the premises, washed it all down and repaired the ravages of work. I warmed to the nature of the place. It had a curious, relaxed, easy-going, familial feel to it, like a well-run country house. </p> <p>I should go back and take a closer look, I thought at the time; so I did, taking with me, by way of quality control officers, my daughter, Lois, and her friend, Natasha, known as Tasha. If anything, the experiences second time around were even warmer. It is not every kitchen that will invite a brace of 11-year-olds in to have a look around, nor every kitchen in which you will find the mother of the proprietors mixing Christmas pudding by hand in a plastic rubbish bin. </p> <p>Nor is it, these days, every kitchen that will allow those same 11-year-olds to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in mixing the aforementioned pudding mixture. God knows what an environmental health officer would have said, had there been one about. Just in case, I should add that the girls washed their hands very thoroughly before they were allowed to muck in. You may well say, oh, it's all very well for him - they knew who he was, so of course they went out of their way to be nice. But I think not. This is just the way they are at The Talbot Inn. It's the nature of the place and the people - relaxed, kindly, hospitable in a rather old-fashioned, rather unfashionable way, and happy to tolerate two inquisitive kids. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the equally relaxed, kindly, hospitable, old-fashioned and unfashionably comfortable bar there was a pint of T'Other and two glasses of homemade apple juice ready and waiting. The apple juice is another mark of the house style. The Clift sisters are very keen on local produce. Actually, they are gently passionate about it: they grow much of the lettuce and vegetables out back in their organic garden. What cannot be eaten in times of glut is pickled. They pick up game from local shoots, who after a day in the field are grateful for the prodigious steak and kidney puddings that await them at the Talbot. The proprietors provide handouts listing their suppliers of cheese, eggs, game, rabbit, meat, preserves and soft fruit, all of which are available locally. Like few other places I have visited, the Talbot is embedded in the area in which it is situated. </p> <p>The cooking is another matter. It is rooted in a cosmopolitan English sensibility and is without pretension. It is homely in the best sense of the word. That is to say, the very best ingredients are properly cooked in the method best suited to them - dishes are a natural extension of the ingredients. </p> <p>There is a menu proper, which goes with the proper dining room - a splendid, panelled room - but for the casual lunchtime trade there's a blackboard menu above the bar, running the gamut from continental European pickled octopus, cod and pesto, hake, pork loin and garlic to pluperfectly British black pudding and apple, stuffed breast of lamb and the aforementioned prodigious steak and kidney pud. </p> <p>In the event, while the girls went for sausage and chips (Tasha) and pasta (Lois), followed by raspberry tart, I pigged out on crab blini, confit of goose gizzards with pesto on toast, eel stew with prunes and pasta, and a hollygog pudding. Well, I mean, really, how often do you see goose gizzards and eel on the same menu, let alone eel with prunes and pasta? Once would be too often for most people. </p> <p>Do I have to tell you that the sausages were alpha-double-plus productions from the butcher down the road, that the pasta was made in the kitchen, buttercup yellow from the egg yolks, and topped with a sensational fresh tomato sauce, that the raspberries were late autumn harvest from the garden, still producing because of the mild so-called winter we had before Christmas? The crab was sweet and slightly nutty, as fresh shellfish should be, and piled on to a thin, crisp blini - a dish of serene simplicity and excellence. The gizzards were all chopped up, musky, mild and rich, lightly pepped by pesto. </p> <p>But if I thought the gizzard was rich, it was but a Weight-Watchers' portion compared with the epic nature of the eel dish. Eel is a wonderful fish, but in terms of richness it makes foie gras or a pot of dripping seem airy-fairy. And my plate came piled high with eel. As for combining it with prunes and pasta, I think it may be a slight case of overkill, particularly after crab and goose gizzards. I suspect that it is a recipe from northern Italy, but I wouldn't swear to it; in its monumental, viscid, unctuous, florid, filling fashion, it was rather good. But I wouldn't describe it as moreish. </p> <p>Indeed, quite how I managed even a couple of mouthfuls of hollygog pudding - a curious concoction of pastry soaked in Golden Syrup, a kind of Worcestershire version of baklava - I'm none to certain, but I did, and very British and delicious it was, too, especially with the accompaniment of proper custard. </p> <p>So we parted company, the Talbot Inn and us, not a moment too soon for my tum. We could have bunked down in one of the comfortable bedrooms at the back, but home and hearth called. The bill was \u00a343.40. We had spent \u00a36.95 at the bar. The pasta had set us back \u00a34.50, the sausage and chips \u00a35, and my four courses \u00a319.95. The other \u00a37 was for the girls' puddings, in case you're counting. Where can you eat so much and so splendidly for so little? Hardly anywhere. We were very cheery, Lois, Tasha and I, as we sped back across country. We'd all had such a good time.</p>",

We find that the sky-blue-flowered Cynoglossum amabile is one of these, so we generally sow that in March. Love-in-a-mist - both the blue Nigella damascena ' Miss Jekyll' and the darker, richer N. hispanica - are perfectly hardy, and most gardeners simply allow them to self-sow. But, that way, the seedlings are invariably overcrowded, whatever your resolutions about thinning them, and we find that we get far more impressive results by sowing and potting off under glass, planting out in April or May at quite wide spacings. And we sow both in autumn and in early spring, as a matter of routine. </p> <p>There is no overall rule for the dianthus tribe. With annual carnations, sowing in the autumn rather than in February will give you rather earlier-flowering plants the next summer. As they start flowering late, anyway, there'll be no problem from premature flowering. It is also worth bearing in mind that these carnations germinate at quite low temperatures.

      "body": "<p>If you were sitting on two job offers - one from, say, Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) and another from the army - which would you choose? The vast majority of graduate job seekers would probably go for Accenture. In fact, 85% of general management graduates and a whopping 90% of IT graduates would prefer to risk their souls in a consultancy than their lives in the army. </p> <p>The research that provided this statistic was commissioned by the army, but it highlights a problem faced by all the armed forces. The army, navy and the RAF, as well as the police (which to many people is now the fourth armed service) all need to hire people of the Accenture calibre. Getting hold of them however is proving increasingly difficult. </p> <p>\"The demographics are against us,\" concedes Chris Allender, head of corporate recruitment at the Metropolitan Police. \"Jobs are becoming more demanding and society more complex, which means that organisations are competing for the diminishing pool of high quality graduates capable of doing them. In the case of the services there are other cultural factors at work. There has, for example, been a movement throughout the western world away from uniformed organisations.\" </p> <p>\"Graduate officer recruitment has been a challenge in the past few years,\" agrees a spokesperson for the Royal Navy, \"as it has been for many other organisations. The core functionality of the armed forces, the structure and discipline required, is at odds with young people's lives. We are unable to change this because a more relaxed, unstructured approach will not produce the people who can function in the most stressful situations. But it should not be forgotten that there are groups of people who thrive in a more structured environment.\" </p> <p>The shift away from the armed forces is a result of cultural change. Society is more egalitarian and in most sectors discrimination on the grounds of race, sexual orientation or gender is on the run. </p> <p>However, accusations of institutional racism, an in-built gender imbalance which derives in part from differences in strength and endurance, and the difficulty the forces have in dealing with homosexuality have created a perception that the services do not share the new, more egalitarian world order. </p> <p>Secondly, concepts such as self-sacrifice and service are themselves difficult to sustain in an intellectual environment dominated by post-modernism. Being prepared to die for your beliefs now looks like the result of either indoctrinated insanity or a quaint old-fashioned naivety. </p> <p>\"Queen and country is now very low on the list of reasons for people joining,\" accepts the Royal Navy. \"The old elite retains these beliefs, but people joining today are much more likely to be motivated by less selfless considerations.\" </p> <p>You may not be asking what you can do for their country. But consider what your country's armed forces could do for you The army identifies four key factors. Well for starters, there is the active outdoors lifestyle. Apart from professional sportsmen and women, no other profession offers you so much money for breathing fresh air and playing games. It's only when the bullets start flying that things get serious. </p> <p>Then there is the opportunity to test yourself in the most challenging environments humanity has to offer. Once you've served in Belfast or the Balkans, few other places can cause you much trepidation. There is genuine variety in employment and location, and finally there is the training and opportunity for advancement. </p> <p>The forces used to be perceived as a career dead-end, but with leadership now one of the key attributes in successful management, the forces are acknowledged to be a stepping stone to many other opportunities. </p> <p>While the alternative lifestyle the services offer will only ever appeal to a tiny minority of graduates, there are signs that the demographics are about to change. </p> <p>\"We have just completed some research into this,\" says Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Howard of the Army Training and Recruitment Agency, \"and the generation born after 1982 are going to be different. We are calling them the 'millennial kids', and we expect them to be less bolshy and cynical than 'generation X'. They're likely to be more patriotic in a general cultural sense, and this gives us cause for optimism.\" </p> <p>So, if you feel yourself strangely attracted to a career in uniform, don't worry. You may be a precursor of a generational shift in fashion rather than an oddity. The loose-fit culture that has dominated the past decade-and-a-half may be about to change.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were sitting on two job offers - one from, say, Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting) and another from the army - which would you choose? The vast majority of graduate job seekers would probably go for Accenture. In fact, 85% of general management graduates and a whopping 90% of IT graduates would prefer to risk their souls in a consultancy than their lives in the army. The research that provided this statistic was commissioned by the army, but it highlights a problem faced by all the armed forces. The army, navy and the RAF, as well as the police (which to many people is now the fourth armed service) all need to hire people of the Accenture calibre. Getting hold of them however is proving increasingly difficult. \"The demographics are against us,\" concedes Chris Allender, head of corporate recruitment at the Metropolitan Police. \"Jobs are becoming more demanding and society more complex, which means that organisations are competing for the diminishing pool of high quality graduates capable of doing them. In the case of the services there are other cultural factors at work. There has, for example, been a movement throughout the western world away from uniformed organisations.\" \"Graduate officer recruitment has been a challenge in the past few years,\" agrees a spokesperson for the Royal Navy, \"as it has been for many other organisations. The core functionality of the armed forces, the structure and discipline required, is at odds with young people's lives. We are unable to change this because a more relaxed, unstructured approach will not produce the people who can function in the most stressful situations. But it should not be forgotten that there are groups of people who thrive in a more structured environment.\" The shift away from the armed forces is a result of cultural change. Society is more egalitarian and in most sectors discrimination on the grounds of race, sexual orientation or gender is on the run. However, accusations of institutional racism, an in-built gender imbalance which derives in part from differences in strength and endurance, and the difficulty the forces have in dealing with homosexuality have created a perception that the services do not share the new, more egalitarian world order. Secondly, concepts such as self-sacrifice and service are themselves difficult to sustain in an intellectual environment dominated by post-modernism. Being prepared to die for your beliefs now looks like the result of either indoctrinated insanity or a quaint old-fashioned naivety. \"Queen and country is now very low on the list of reasons for people joining,\" accepts the Royal Navy. \"The old elite retains these beliefs, but people joining today are much more likely to be motivated by less selfless considerations.\" You may not be asking what you can do for their country. But consider what your country's armed forces could do for you The army identifies four key factors. Well for starters, there is the active outdoors lifestyle. Apart from professional sportsmen and women, no other profession offers you so much money for breathing fresh air and playing games. It's only when the bullets start flying that things get serious. Then there is the opportunity to test yourself in the most challenging environments humanity has to offer. Once you've served in Belfast or the Balkans, few other places can cause you much trepidation. There is genuine variety in employment and location, and finally there is the training and opportunity for advancement. The forces used to be perceived as a career dead-end, but with leadership now one of the key attributes in successful management, the forces are acknowledged to be a stepping stone to many other opportunities. While the alternative lifestyle the services offer will only ever appeal to a tiny minority of graduates, there are signs that the demographics are about to change. \"We have just completed some research into this,\" says Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Howard of the Army Training and Recruitment Agency, \"and the generation born after 1982 are going to be different. We are calling them the 'millennial kids', and we expect them to be less bolshy and cynical than 'generation X'. They're likely to be more patriotic in a general cultural sense, and this gives us cause for optimism.\" So, if you feel yourself strangely attracted to a career in uniform, don't worry. You may be a precursor of a generational shift in fashion rather than an oddity. The loose-fit culture that has dominated the past decade-and-a-half may be about to change.",

Now, new research reveals that it's also taking over the workplace. The study, conducted by the Future Foundation for Startle, a specialist in the digital delivery of music, found that more than half (54%) the UK working population listens to music while they do their jobs. Men are more tuneful in their work than women - 61% won't work in silence, compared with 41% of women. </p> <p>And by far the biggest music lovers are 16 to 24-year olds: eight in 10 of them admit to listening to music during their working day. </p> <p>Why are employees whistling while they work?

Psychologists have suggested that music can have a beneficial effect on workplace performance - though evidence remains scarce. The so-called 'Mozart effect' has becoming a booming industry in the US after it was found that playing Mozart to children raised their IQs and stimulated their mental development. State-funded schools in Florida are now legally required to play classical music. </p> <p>Adrian North, lecturer in psychology at Leicester University, says the latest research shows that music does indeed have an effect on workers, affecting both morale and productivity: \"If employees like the music that's being played, it improves morale,\" he explains. \"But if they don't like the music, it's no better - or even worse - than silence.\" </p> <p>The effect of music on productivity is more complex, says Adrian: \"If you're doing dull and repetitive tasks, music makes you more alert and improves your productivity. However, if you're doing tasks which require thought and analysis, music has a detrimental effect. That's because the brain, like a computer, can only deal with so much at the same time. If you overload it, it crashes.\" </p> <p>Whether or not your boss allows music in your office usually comes down to individual company policy and the nature of your profession. \"Background music changes the atmosphere in workplaces, making them more informal, light-hearted places,\" says chartered psychologist Martin Lloyd-Elliott. </p> <p>The latest dance track may get creative juices flowing in an advertising design studio, but probably won't be seen as appropriate in a corporate environment. </p> <p>What if you can't stand the choice of music in your workplace? Last month, Slade and Wizzard's Christmas anthems were banned from Dixon's in-store playlist, after staff and shoppers said the songs were \"too annoying\". The Startle survey reveals that squabbles over music selections can dent camaraderie. One in 10 offices - a significant minority - are brought to a daily halt when colleagues quarrel about which tunes to play. After all, one man's Robbie Williams is another man's Poison. </p> <p>The solution: democratic compromise. \"The office should organise a rota system, where each day, everyone gets to play their choice of music - or have periods of silence,\" suggests Adrian. \"I have seen this work well in workplaces.\" </p> <p>Andrew Ross, a designer in a music company, says his office used to receive regular complaints from the marketing department next door about the cacophony of noise generated by the CD players on everybody's desk (a dozen of them). </p> <p>\"We resolved it by allowing one person to choose the communal music each day,\" he recalls. \"Everyone else had to listen to their own selection on a personal stereo. It made the working environment far calmer and the suits in marketing left us alone.\" </p> <p>But some of us - myself included - find it impossible to work with any background noise. Stick in a CD and my working day becomes no more productive (though I'd like to think a little more tuneful) than a karaoke night at the local pub. According to Adrian, introverts can't tolerate musical stimulation because their resting brains already work at a fast rate. Extroverts need outside stimulation to rev up their brains. </p> <p>\"I would encourage people to be assertive about their right to work in a peaceful environment,\" says Martin. \"I have worked with people who persuaded their team not to listen to music at all. Although they resisted at first, when the decision was enforced everybody welcomed it and admitted it helped them work.\" </p> <p><strong> If you don't remember anything else...</strong></p> <p>Like it or not, music looks set to become a permanent fixture. The research predicts that by 2010, two in five people will be listening to music while they work.</p>",

If you overload it, it crashes.\" Whether or not your boss allows music in your office usually comes down to individual company policy and the nature of your profession. \"Background music changes the atmosphere in workplaces, making them more informal, light-hearted places,\" says chartered psychologist Martin Lloyd-Elliott. The latest dance track may get creative juices flowing in an advertising design studio, but probably won't be seen as appropriate in a corporate environment. What if you can't stand the choice of music in your workplace? Last month, Slade and Wizzard's Christmas anthems were banned from Dixon's in-store playlist, after staff and shoppers said the songs were \"too annoying\". The Startle survey reveals that squabbles over music selections can dent camaraderie. One in 10 offices - a significant minority - are brought to a daily halt when colleagues quarrel about which tunes to play. After all, one man's Robbie Williams is another man's Poison. The solution: democratic compromise. \"The office should organise a rota system, where each day, everyone gets to play their choice of music - or have periods of silence,\" suggests Adrian. \"I have seen this work well in workplaces.\" Andrew Ross, a designer in a music company, says his office used to receive regular complaints from the marketing department next door about the cacophony of noise generated by the CD players on everybody's desk (a dozen of them). \"We resolved it by allowing one person to choose the communal music each day,\" he recalls. \"Everyone else had to listen to their own selection on a personal stereo. It made the working environment far calmer and the suits in marketing left us alone.\" But some of us - myself included - find it impossible to work with any background noise. Stick in a CD and my working day becomes no more productive (though I'd like to think a little more tuneful) than a karaoke night at the local pub. According to Adrian, introverts can't tolerate musical stimulation because their resting brains already work at a fast rate. Extroverts need outside stimulation to rev up their brains. \"I would encourage people to be assertive about their right to work in a peaceful environment,\" says Martin. \"I have worked with people who persuaded their team not to listen to music at all. Although they resisted at first, when the decision was enforced everybody welcomed it and admitted it helped them work.\" If you don't remember anything else... Like it or not, music looks set to become a permanent fixture. The research predicts that by 2010, two in five people will be listening to music while they work.",

He cut his own deal with Fish Design and backs the idea of working for a smaller company. With a degree in business studies and human resource management from Middlesex University he became interested in the internet and went on to take a masters in interactive computer systems. He worked for Blockbusters Video to fund his course and travel. When he had to look for a work placement he checked out the Blockbusters website and got in touch with Fish. \"I got their details, sent a CV and then negotiated the package via email. I met the two partners just before my placement began and we all seemed happy. \"The partners took me on initially to help out with various websites but as my understanding of the internet grew, my competence increased. After my three month placement, Fish offered me a job.\" Ambition? \"To keep on learning and eventually to run my own commercial site and/or company.\" Tip to others: Consider working for some of the less obvious players in the market.",

The issue of union funding is to all intents and purposes off the political agenda.</p> <p>The big Labour-affiliated unions were yesterday content to have their own financial backing for the party - likely to be close to \u00a310m for the coming general election campaign - out of the spotlight for a change. \"All the embarrassment has come from New Labour's ham-fisted efforts to obtain money from the private sector\", said a senior official.</p> <p>Rows over New Labour sleaze and influence-peddling involving rich businessmen can have positive spin offs for the unions, showing their transparent and democratic funding role in a more positive light. \"So long as everything is open and above board and people are genuinely committed to the aims and ideals of the party, we don't see any reason why these people shouldn't be allowed to contribute money to support the party,\" a GMB spokesman said yesterday of the Labour's newly-revealed donors.</p> <p>Others in the party are less relaxed about the ever-growing political leverage they believe is enjoyed by Labour's rich new friends - and the latest disclosures about the donations from Robert Bourne, whose consortium is poised to buy the Millennium Dome, will only intensify that anxiety.</p> <p>From the days of Ramsay MacDonald's dalliances with duchesses to Harold Wilson's coteries of businessmen, there is a long-established tradition of Labour leaders courting the wealthy. But under Tony Blair, the process has gone far further and is widely seen as reflecting an accelerated Americanisation of Britain's political culture.</p> <p>With corporate donations to the Tories falling away, both parties are, according to a recent report from the union-backed Labour Research Department, \"increasingly reliant on wealthy individuals for cash as politics turns into a rich person's game\". Clive Soley, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, said last night that both MPs and ordinary members were \"unhappy and uncomfortable\" with the growing reliance on large business donations.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying that rich people can't have a social conscience and they're only doing it for their own sleazy reasons and I haven't heard anyone saying we should hand it back. But there is certainly concern about it.\"</p> <p>Mr Soley, along with some other Labour figures, says he is now attracted to state funding for political parties or tax breaks for small donors as a way of saving the party from sinking into an increasingly sleazy political culture.</p> <p>Although new rules will next month set a new spending limit for general election spending and require all donations over \u00a35,000 to be declared, there is little expectation that these changes will by themselves solve the problem.</p> <p>Labour is also concerned that tax breaks for small donors would favour the Tories' generally better-off supporters. But many Labour and trade union figures remain strongly opposed to state funding as an alternative to the party's current success with its new billionaire chums, citing public hostility and the German experience of state funding combined with private sleaze.</p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7d728\">Should political donors be named?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Committee on standards in public life</a></p>",

Rows over New Labour sleaze and influence-peddling involving rich businessmen can have positive spin offs for the unions, showing their transparent and democratic funding role in a more positive light. \"So long as everything is open and above board and people are genuinely committed to the aims and ideals of the party, we don't see any reason why these people shouldn't be allowed to contribute money to support the party,\" a GMB spokesman said yesterday of the Labour's newly-revealed donors. Others in the party are less relaxed about the ever-growing political leverage they believe is enjoyed by Labour's rich new friends - and the latest disclosures about the donations from Robert Bourne, whose consortium is poised to buy the Millennium Dome, will only intensify that anxiety. From the days of Ramsay MacDonald's dalliances with duchesses to Harold Wilson's coteries of businessmen, there is a long-established tradition of Labour leaders courting the wealthy. But under Tony Blair, the process has gone far further and is widely seen as reflecting an accelerated Americanisation of Britain's political culture. With corporate donations to the Tories falling away, both parties are, according to a recent report from the union-backed Labour Research Department, \"increasingly reliant on wealthy individuals for cash as politics turns into a rich person's game\". Clive Soley, chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party, said last night that both MPs and ordinary members were \"unhappy and uncomfortable\" with the growing reliance on large business donations. \"I'm not saying that rich people can't have a social conscience and they're only doing it for their own sleazy reasons and I haven't heard anyone saying we should hand it back. But there is certainly concern about it.\" Mr Soley, along with some other Labour figures, says he is now attracted to state funding for political parties or tax breaks for small donors as a way of saving the party from sinking into an increasingly sleazy political culture. Although new rules will next month set a new spending limit for general election spending and require all donations over \u00a35,000 to be declared, there is little expectation that these changes will by themselves solve the problem. Labour is also concerned that tax breaks for small donors would favour the Tories' generally better-off supporters. But many Labour and trade union figures remain strongly opposed to state funding as an alternative to the party's current success with its new billionaire chums, citing public hostility and the German experience of state funding combined with private sleaze.

The secretary general, who makes the appointments, is not required to have a short-list, let alone advertise the job or give the initial screening to a selection panel. Many former senior staff at the UN criticise the system, but nothing has been done to change it, despite lip service to reforming the UN. \"I'm not sure the secretary general should start from the position that Ruritania should get a particular post,\" says Sir Marrack Goulding, who served as under-secretary general for political affairs until 1997. \"We need to have a much more transparent set of procedures for doing this.\" \"What is unacceptable, and it happens all the time, is that governments put pressure on the secretary general to appoint the person they want.

Colonel Terry Taylor, the assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an independent think-tank that focuses on the study of conflict, served as a political affairs officer at UN headquarters in New York in the mid-1990s. He believes changes in the selection procedure are needed. \"We should make people compete for the top jobs and force governments to say why they wouldn't find a particular person acceptable,\" he argues. In the UNHCR case, according to a former diplomat who represented his country on the UN security council, the Dutch probably felt they had a right to a top job \"because they are a loyal and energetic member of the UN which pays a lot into the budget and haven't had a Dutchman at a senior level for a number of years\". The UNHCR, led for the past decade by Japan's Sadako Ogata, is close to bankruptcy after a shortfall in funding by the 14 governments which usually provide about 98% of its money; the body took $40m of its $50m (\u00a333m) in capital reserves last autumn to cover running costs. Donors for broke UNHCR Staff are hoping that, as a former prime minister from western Europe, Mr Lubbers will have the clout to get donors to be more generous for this year's huge projected budget of $953m (\u00a3635m). Another controversial recent appointment, that of Kenzo Oshima to head the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), was done on Mr Annan's own initiative. According to a senior UN insider, the secretary general is dissatisfied with the work of a particular Japanese senior official in another post in the UN and wishes to remove him. To keep Tokyo happy, (it is, after all, another major UN donor), he asked the Japanese government to nominate someone to head OCHA. When Tokyo picked Mr Oshima, who runs the department of international peace co-operation in the Japanese prime minister's office, Mr Annan appointed him. Under the UN charter, jobs are required to reflect an equitable geographical distribution that would befit a world body. For the roughly 1,800 jobs in the secretariat in New York, a country's economic weight, as reflected in its budget dues to the UN, plays a role. Britain had 56 of these 1,800 jobs in New York, or 3%, according to figures from the mid-1990s. When the figures are broken down for the senior jobs - those at department-head level and above - Britain had 10 out of 210, or 5%, corresponding exactly to its contribution to the overall budget. The picture changes radically when it comes to the under-secretary general level and the heads of the main funds and programmes, such as the UNHCR, the UN Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the UN Development Programme and the UN Population Fund. These are mainly staffed by people from the wealthiest countries, with the United States disproportionately represented. Given that Washington has for years refused to pay its dues in full, this discrepancy has caused major resentment. These appointments are all made by the secretary general. The \"agencies\" of the United Nations - the International Labour Organisation, the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and the IMF - have separate systems of staffing and paying the top jobs, over which Mr Annan has no control. The UN secretariat's salaries are said by the UN to be around half those of the European Union, Nato and the World Bank. Some governments are believed to top up the pay of their nationals who have top UN jobs, although this is against UN rules. Britain calls for reform Britain has been making low-key calls for reform since the Labour government gained office. \"We must have a UN whose staff and leadership represent all the countries of the world, but they must be recruited and promoted on the basis of their ability to do the job, not their nationality or political connections,\" Clare Short, the secretary of state for international development, told a New York audience in October 1999. Since then, she has put more detail into her ideas, calling in last month's white paper on globalisation for \"open and competitive processes for the selection of top management\". \"This could include a definition of the competencies for the post, selection and search committees,\" the paper said, \"and a clear process for taking the final decision, in which competence would be put above considerations of nationality.\" Posts filled by the secretary general UN High Commissioner for Refugees The UNHCR assists 22m refugees, many in camps, and is responsible for protecting asylum-seekers worldwide Head Ruud Lubbers, Netherlands Annual salary $196,590 (\u00a3131,000) UN Population Fund The UNFPA supports regional programmes which give advice on family planning and safe motherhood, based on empowering women Head Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, Saudi Arabia Salary $196,590 Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA provides emergency relief for victims of natural disasters Head Kenzo Oshima, Japan Salary $196, 590 The UNDP supports democratic governance, development and poverty reduction, and publishes the influential annual Human Development Report Head Mark Malloch Brown, Britain Salary $196,590 World Food Programme The WFP is the frontline agency for shipping food to famine victims.

They have entered the 'enterprise syndicate' but not the 'power syndicate',\" Alison Jamieson wrote in the recently published The Antimafia.</p> <p>It is helped along by the march of Italian women into the labour force and universities. Fewer are willing to stay at home. In 1990 one woman was indicted for mafia association. By 1995 there were 89 such indictments.</p> <p>Prosecutors hoped women would influence men to become supergrasses, but more often they denounced collaboration as betrayal, not wanting to swap the world they knew for a witness protection programme.</p> <p>\"Instead of leading the tide of righteous citizens against crime, women turned out to be even more entrenched in mafia values than men,\" Clare Longrigg wrote in Mafia Women.</p> <p>Even if it is not quite a revolution, women are playing a decisive role in rebuilding the mafia after a sustained assault by the state.</p> <p>Erminia Giuliano's behaviour as officers invaded her kitchen suggests that the change is irreversible.</p> <p>After insisting on a shower and visit from her hairdresser, she donned high heels, a fake leopard-skin coat and handcuffs, and told her daughters: \"I'm counting on you now.

Meanwhile her rival Maria Licciardi, 49, who rules the Secondigliano quarter, continues to evade a police search after a gang war last year in which more than 50 people died. On it goes, a list of women who appear to have revolutionised a sub-culture in which chauvinists value submissive females principally for bridging families by marriage and childbirth As if to confirm the revolution, the Italian media has gleefully bestowed nicknames. Ms Giuliano's blue eyes earned her Celeste - meaning heavenly - though she also goes by Lady Camorra. Ms Licciardi is the Princess. Others are Ice Eyes, Queen, Lady Clan. It is an intoxicating cocktail: girl power with guns, gangsta mammas, gorgeous but merciless femmes fatales. Media brio is understandable, for the story has everything. Except it is not quite what it seems. Mafia mythology is substituting omnipotent matriarchs for wives who silently served pasta to husbands plotting murder. Neither image is accurate. Some women are taking control, but they would never dare do so by elbowing aside male competition. Only when their men have been killed or jailed and there is no obvious successor do they step in. There have been many vacancies in recent years. Jails are full of bosses and lieutenants betrayed by thousands of supergrasses. Ms Giuliano became boss only after the last of her five brothers was imprisoned. Ms Licciardi would not be in charge had not the next male relative in line been murdered. Ditto the Zappia sisters and Scalisi. \"These are resourceful, strong women but they are mostly stop-gaps, waiting for men to come out or sons to grow up,\" a Naples prosecutor said. More significant is the way women are engaging in the nuts and bolts of crime, moving on from preparing and running drugs to accountancy and extortion. \"Economic and financial operations, including money laundering, are increasingly dominated by women. They have entered the 'enterprise syndicate' but not the 'power syndicate',\" Alison Jamieson wrote in the recently published The Antimafia. It is helped along by the march of Italian women into the labour force and universities. Fewer are willing to stay at home. In 1990 one woman was indicted for mafia association. By 1995 there were 89 such indictments. Prosecutors hoped women would influence men to become supergrasses, but more often they denounced collaboration as betrayal, not wanting to swap the world they knew for a witness protection programme. \"Instead of leading the tide of righteous citizens against crime, women turned out to be even more entrenched in mafia values than men,\" Clare Longrigg wrote in Mafia Women. Even if it is not quite a revolution, women are playing a decisive role in rebuilding the mafia after a sustained assault by the state. Erminia Giuliano's behaviour as officers invaded her kitchen suggests that the change is irreversible. After insisting on a shower and visit from her hairdresser, she donned high heels, a fake leopard-skin coat and handcuffs, and told her daughters: \"I'm counting on you now. I am relaxed. I have taught you all the true values in life.\"",

      "body": "<p>Here's a puzzle. What connects the ancient and the modern, is both distinctly British yet also entirely international and can still arouse excitement and fear as much today as when first invented thousands of years ago?</p> <p>Answer: Our enduring fascination with mazes. And it's mazes that have been Adrian Fisher's expertise for the last 20 years. He's become an authority in the field of maze design and is one of Britain's great experts in this area.</p> <p>His love of mazes and labyrinths developed from an understanding of landscape, a talent for mathematics and a keen appreciation of art, which led to him first to constructing a hedge maze in his father's garden as a young man.</p> <p>But his big break came in 1980 when Robert Runcie was made Archbishop of Canterbury and, during the ceremony, used the metaphor of the maze in his sermon, likening it to the path of life. It inspired Mr Fisher to write to a newspaper pointing out that maze metaphors had been used by the Christian church for centuries.</p> <p>After the letter he landed his first commission, the Archbishop's maze in Grey's Court, Henley. \"I met a retired diplomat called Randoll Coate and he and I eventually built 15 mazes together,\" he recalls. \"We did up to three in a year, not as a serious venture at first, but enough to make me realise, in 1983, that I should go for it. So I gave up management consultancy and went full-time.\"</p> <p>His first commissions were few due to the specialised nature of the business but he had faith in the potential of his venture. \"I knew mazes were inherently fascinating; they're an intriguing subject which catches people's imagination.\"</p> <p>So how did he get his new business going? \"It took me two years to earn as much as my previous salary but that's typical in a small business. There've been many people who have come up to me and said: 'I nearly did that but wasn't sure about my health or age,' and so didn't. You have to take that first step, then it seems obvious.\"</p> <p>He wrote to budding festival or gardening displays offering his services. This led to him building a hedge maze at Newquay Zoo, designing a Beatles maze in Liverpool for the garden festival of 1984 and one for the Bath festival. \"Every time there was an opportunity I got in touch and asked if I could join in and was told who to talk to.\"</p> <p>And if, when you think of a maze, it brings to mind only Hampton Court and hedges, then of course you'd be right, but that isn't the entire repertoire of mazes Mr Fisher de signs. There are mirror mazes like the one at Longleat, turf mazes, corn mazes, love mazes, mazes with bridges and tunnels all with varying degrees of complexity, even a maze constructed from cars.</p> <p>\"All the mazes are different,\" Fisher explains. \"Sometimes they're very formal, with right angles, and at others there's not a straight line anywhere, they're all curls and swirls. Sometimes they portray the image of a pirate galleon or a corn maze across acres of ground.\"</p> <p>So what makes a good maze? \"It has to be compelling, the eye has to be grabbed but it also has to be functional like a piece of furniture. You have to lay all your traps in advance and then stand back and let people explore. It has to entertain. You must allow your visitors to win just before they've had enough or they'll get bored. You must have lots of deceptions and teases. People must feel it is really tricky and frustrating but not as bad as road rage.\"</p> <p>As well as the mazes he's designed are the books he's published. Initially they were to generate publicity for his work; he wrote leaflets about mazes which he gave to the visitors of the designs he had constructed.</p> <p>\"Once I'd built a few it was much easier to talk to a publisher and show the portfolio and get something more substantial commissioned. So The Art of the Maze was published, the first really serious book on mazes since 1922.\"</p> <p>Fisher has found the internet has greatly expanded his business. His website gets thousands of hits a week and has helped his work internationally. As a result his designs now span dozens of countries across four continents. But it's the simple things that drive him on.</p> <p>\"What's fun is working from home, able to see my children half a dozen times a day and not have travelling time or cost. The lack of exhaustion is a very positive thing; you can be much more versatile with your time.\"</p>",

But his big break came in 1980 when Robert Runcie was made Archbishop of Canterbury and, during the ceremony, used the metaphor of the maze in his sermon, likening it to the path of life. It inspired Mr Fisher to write to a newspaper pointing out that maze metaphors had been used by the Christian church for centuries. After the letter he landed his first commission, the Archbishop's maze in Grey's Court, Henley. \"I met a retired diplomat called Randoll Coate and he and I eventually built 15 mazes together,\" he recalls. \"We did up to three in a year, not as a serious venture at first, but enough to make me realise, in 1983, that I should go for it. So I gave up management consultancy and went full-time.\" His first commissions were few due to the specialised nature of the business but he had faith in the potential of his venture. \"I knew mazes were inherently fascinating; they're an intriguing subject which catches people's imagination.\" So how did he get his new business going? \"It took me two years to earn as much as my previous salary but that's typical in a small business. There've been many people who have come up to me and said: 'I nearly did that but wasn't sure about my health or age,' and so didn't. You have to take that first step, then it seems obvious.\" He wrote to budding festival or gardening displays offering his services. This led to him building a hedge maze at Newquay Zoo, designing a Beatles maze in Liverpool for the garden festival of 1984 and one for the Bath festival. \"Every time there was an opportunity I got in touch and asked if I could join in and was told who to talk to.\" And if, when you think of a maze, it brings to mind only Hampton Court and hedges, then of course you'd be right, but that isn't the entire repertoire of mazes Mr Fisher de signs. There are mirror mazes like the one at Longleat, turf mazes, corn mazes, love mazes, mazes with bridges and tunnels all with varying degrees of complexity, even a maze constructed from cars. \"All the mazes are different,\" Fisher explains. \"Sometimes they're very formal, with right angles, and at others there's not a straight line anywhere, they're all curls and swirls. Sometimes they portray the image of a pirate galleon or a corn maze across acres of ground.\" So what makes a good maze? \"It has to be compelling, the eye has to be grabbed but it also has to be functional like a piece of furniture. You have to lay all your traps in advance and then stand back and let people explore. It has to entertain. You must allow your visitors to win just before they've had enough or they'll get bored. You must have lots of deceptions and teases. People must feel it is really tricky and frustrating but not as bad as road rage.\" As well as the mazes he's designed are the books he's published. Initially they were to generate publicity for his work; he wrote leaflets about mazes which he gave to the visitors of the designs he had constructed. \"Once I'd built a few it was much easier to talk to a publisher and show the portfolio and get something more substantial commissioned. So The Art of the Maze was published, the first really serious book on mazes since 1922.\" Fisher has found the internet has greatly expanded his business. His website gets thousands of hits a week and has helped his work internationally. As a result his designs now span dozens of countries across four continents. But it's the simple things that drive him on. \"What's fun is working from home, able to see my children half a dozen times a day and not have travelling time or cost. The lack of exhaustion is a very positive thing; you can be much more versatile with your time.\"",

      "body": "<p>Police forces across the north were put on the alert for a new wave of animal rights terrorism yesterday after two letter bombs exploded at a farm and an agricultural auctioneers.</p> <p>The blasts in Yorkshire, which injured a farmer and may have damaged the eyesight of a secretary, followed a similar mail bomb sent to a pest control firm last week in Cheshire, which injured the owner's six-year-old daughter.</p> <p>A fourth device was also made safe on December 15 at an agricultural business in Masham, north Yorkshire.</p> <p>The county's deputy chief constable, Peter Walker, last night warned anyone connected to the animal trade to be on their guard and said they should not open unexpected packages.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Kent, 46 hounds worth almost \u00a3100,000 were stolen by the Animal Liberation Front from a Beagle kennel near Wye College, in the early hours of yesterday.</p> <p>The group claimed responsibility for the theft in an email to a local radio station in which activist James George claimed the dogs had been kept in inhumane conditions. However, hunt secretary Will Denne dismissed the accusation insisting the beagles, which are bred to hunt hares, were well cared for.</p> <p>As the search for the hounds continued last night, detectives in Yorkshire continued to piece together evidence from the three attacks.</p> <p>Padded envelopes containing batteries, small nails and ball bearings were used in all three attacks, for which no-one has claimed responsibility.

      "bodyText": "Police forces across the north were put on the alert for a new wave of animal rights terrorism yesterday after two letter bombs exploded at a farm and an agricultural auctioneers. The blasts in Yorkshire, which injured a farmer and may have damaged the eyesight of a secretary, followed a similar mail bomb sent to a pest control firm last week in Cheshire, which injured the owner's six-year-old daughter. A fourth device was also made safe on December 15 at an agricultural business in Masham, north Yorkshire. The county's deputy chief constable, Peter Walker, last night warned anyone connected to the animal trade to be on their guard and said they should not open unexpected packages. Meanwhile in Kent, 46 hounds worth almost \u00a3100,000 were stolen by the Animal Liberation Front from a Beagle kennel near Wye College, in the early hours of yesterday. The group claimed responsibility for the theft in an email to a local radio station in which activist James George claimed the dogs had been kept in inhumane conditions. However, hunt secretary Will Denne dismissed the accusation insisting the beagles, which are bred to hunt hares, were well cared for. As the search for the hounds continued last night, detectives in Yorkshire continued to piece together evidence from the three attacks. Padded envelopes containing batteries, small nails and ball bearings were used in all three attacks, for which no-one has claimed responsibility. Detectives are not yet ruling out other motives but animal issues are common to each of the targets. \"We are liaising with other forces including the Metropolitan police anti-terrorist branch to see if the cases are definitely linked,\" said Mr Walker. \"It is only by good fortune that no one has been seriously injured or killed. The first of yesterday's incidents saw the centre of the east Yorkshire village of Patrington sealed off after an explosion, triggered when 43-year-old Janet Blythe opened a Jiffybag at local estate agents Frank Hill and Sons. The explosion rocked the two-storey building, and Mrs Blythe, who had only recently recovered from heart problems, was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, suffering from facial injuries. Frank Hill's is well known on the Holderness peninsular of east Yorkshire for livestock and farm auctions and a friend of its 80-year-old founder, Charles Hill, who keeps sheep on an estate near Patrington, said that animal rights extremists were inevitably in the frame. The second blast saw a 58-year-old farmer near Ripon, North Yorkshire, have what police called a miraculous escape, when he opened a nail bomb which splintered furniture. The farmer, who is not being identified for his own protection, escaped with minor facial injuries and severe shock. Police appealed to anyone in the agricultural industry to clearly identify packages when sending routine mail. Army bomb disposal experts from Catterick military base in north Yorkshire are examining debris from both of yesterday's devices. Mrs Blythe was in a comfortable condition last night, with injuries to her face and eyes. The child victim of the Cheshire bomb is recovering from superficial injuries to her legs.",

      "body": "<p>Train travel should be something we look forward to - a window seat looking out on our green and pleasant land, silver service at mealtimes, the chance to relax with a novel and porters to carry our Louis Vuitton cases to a waiting cab.</p> <p>Dream on, especially at the moment, when the prime consideration is whether the train will ever reach its destination the same day, let alone on time. And to add insult to injury, some train operators have signalled fare increases from tomorrow. So, in the meantime, the only concern - other than arriving - should be to pay as little as legally possible.</p> <p>Once railways charged by the mile. Now, thanks to a variety of ticket offers, the near-400 miles between London and Edinburgh can even be marginally cheaper than travelling half the distance to Leeds. A \u00a3225 first-class return to the Scottish capital includes two meals plus car parking while the \u00a3184 first-class return to Leeds only produces tea or coffee.</p> <p>But most of the best deals are for second-class travellers prepared to avoid peak time.</p> <p>Four can sometimes travel as cheaply as one - Silverlink offers up to four adults travelling off-peak on its Birmingham to London route a ticket for the price of two, and GNER to Leeds has a deal that two, three or four people can travel from only \u00a354 return.</p> <p>And if you know what to ask for, travel from A to B can cost you very little - although sometimes from B to A can be even less. As a general rule, return journeys originating in London are more expensive than similar trips starting elsewhere. Marketing executives have decreed that Londoners have more money - on the other hand, those living outside are more prone to jump into their cars and so need more encouragement to take to the rails.</p> <p><b> London-Bath</b></p> <p>Costs range from \u00a319 to \u00a3109 and booking in advance helps. For those travelling to Bath from Paddington by First Great Western, trains leave every 30 minutes with a 1 hour 20 minutes journey time costing \u00a325.50 if booked the day before travel and \u00a372 if you buy on the day of travel. First-class after 9.25am is \u00a380.65, but \u00a3109 before.</p> <p>If you're prepared to choose a slower and less frequent service from Waterloo on the Wales &amp; West trains to Bath you will save about \u00a345. If you buy your ticket on the day you travel it will cost only \u00a324.90 and booked a day in advance just \u00a319. The journey will take four hours, though.</p> <p><b> London-Birmingham</b></p> <p>Fares range from \u00a315 to \u00a3137 and there is a choice of three routes from London to Birmingham; the fast Virgin service and two slower ones, Silverlink or Chiltern. Euston to Birmingham by Virgin can cost as much as \u00a380, if the ticket is bought on the day of travel, and takes just under two hours - trains should leave every 30 minutes. Being prepared to spend an extra half hour or so on a train can produce significant savings. It can take up to three hours travelling by Silverlink, but will cost you only \u00a316.90 return if you leave Euston after 9.30 compared to \u00a334.90 return if you travel earlier.</p> <p>A slightly quicker option with Chiltern will take two hours and 30 minutes. It departs from Marylebone, and arrives at Snow Hill, (10 minutes from the centre of Birmingham), and will cost only \u00a321.50 return if travelling after 8.30 am.</p> <p>But you can have speed and low fares by booking seven days in advance with Virgin. You could pay \u00a315 to travel to Birmingham New Street while booking three days in advance will cost \u00a322. Mind you, its first-class open return will set you back \u00a3137.</p> <p><b> London-Swansea</b></p> <p>Great Western Trains has the only practical London- to-Swansea route, and fares cost from \u00a334 to \u00a3165. Departing from Paddington, it will cost you \u00a334 if booked the day before travel. If bought on the day of travel it can cost as much as \u00a3112 return and only \u00a350 more to travel first-class, \u00a3165 return.</p> <p><b> London-Edinburgh</b></p> <p>When travelling to Scotland, advance booking pays big dividends as fares range from \u00a349 to \u00a3242. Kings Cross to Edinburgh by GNER is \u00a377 return if the ticket is bought on the day of purchase, but booked a day in advance it is \u00a363 and \u00a349 if purchased seven days in advance. Buy an open first-class return and the charge is \u00a3242.</p> <p>The Caledonian sleeper service between London and Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh) is only \u00a389 return for a sleeper apex or a sleeper standard for \u00a3119 return.</p> <p>You share the compartment, either with a friend or a same-sex stranger. A Scotrail sleeper apex ticket to Inverness and Aberdeen is \u00a3109 return, \u00a3185 sleeper standard to Inverness, and \u00a32 more to Aberdeen.

      "bodyText": "Train travel should be something we look forward to - a window seat looking out on our green and pleasant land, silver service at mealtimes, the chance to relax with a novel and porters to carry our Louis Vuitton cases to a waiting cab. Dream on, especially at the moment, when the prime consideration is whether the train will ever reach its destination the same day, let alone on time. And to add insult to injury, some train operators have signalled fare increases from tomorrow. So, in the meantime, the only concern - other than arriving - should be to pay as little as legally possible. Once railways charged by the mile. Now, thanks to a variety of ticket offers, the near-400 miles between London and Edinburgh can even be marginally cheaper than travelling half the distance to Leeds. A \u00a3225 first-class return to the Scottish capital includes two meals plus car parking while the \u00a3184 first-class return to Leeds only produces tea or coffee. But most of the best deals are for second-class travellers prepared to avoid peak time. Four can sometimes travel as cheaply as one - Silverlink offers up to four adults travelling off-peak on its Birmingham to London route a ticket for the price of two, and GNER to Leeds has a deal that two, three or four people can travel from only \u00a354 return. And if you know what to ask for, travel from A to B can cost you very little - although sometimes from B to A can be even less. As a general rule, return journeys originating in London are more expensive than similar trips starting elsewhere. Marketing executives have decreed that Londoners have more money - on the other hand, those living outside are more prone to jump into their cars and so need more encouragement to take to the rails. London-Bath Costs range from \u00a319 to \u00a3109 and booking in advance helps. For those travelling to Bath from Paddington by First Great Western, trains leave every 30 minutes with a 1 hour 20 minutes journey time costing \u00a325.50 if booked the day before travel and \u00a372 if you buy on the day of travel. First-class after 9.25am is \u00a380.65, but \u00a3109 before. If you're prepared to choose a slower and less frequent service from Waterloo on the Wales &amp; West trains to Bath you will save about \u00a345. If you buy your ticket on the day you travel it will cost only \u00a324.90 and booked a day in advance just \u00a319. The journey will take four hours, though. London-Birmingham Fares range from \u00a315 to \u00a3137 and there is a choice of three routes from London to Birmingham; the fast Virgin service and two slower ones, Silverlink or Chiltern. Euston to Birmingham by Virgin can cost as much as \u00a380, if the ticket is bought on the day of travel, and takes just under two hours - trains should leave every 30 minutes. Being prepared to spend an extra half hour or so on a train can produce significant savings. It can take up to three hours travelling by Silverlink, but will cost you only \u00a316.90 return if you leave Euston after 9.30 compared to \u00a334.90 return if you travel earlier. A slightly quicker option with Chiltern will take two hours and 30 minutes. It departs from Marylebone, and arrives at Snow Hill, (10 minutes from the centre of Birmingham), and will cost only \u00a321.50 return if travelling after 8.30 am. But you can have speed and low fares by booking seven days in advance with Virgin. You could pay \u00a315 to travel to Birmingham New Street while booking three days in advance will cost \u00a322. Mind you, its first-class open return will set you back \u00a3137. London-Swansea Great Western Trains has the only practical London- to-Swansea route, and fares cost from \u00a334 to \u00a3165. Departing from Paddington, it will cost you \u00a334 if booked the day before travel. If bought on the day of travel it can cost as much as \u00a3112 return and only \u00a350 more to travel first-class, \u00a3165 return. London-Edinburgh When travelling to Scotland, advance booking pays big dividends as fares range from \u00a349 to \u00a3242. Kings Cross to Edinburgh by GNER is \u00a377 return if the ticket is bought on the day of purchase, but booked a day in advance it is \u00a363 and \u00a349 if purchased seven days in advance. Buy an open first-class return and the charge is \u00a3242. The Caledonian sleeper service between London and Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh) is only \u00a389 return for a sleeper apex or a sleeper standard for \u00a3119 return. You share the compartment, either with a friend or a same-sex stranger. A Scotrail sleeper apex ticket to Inverness and Aberdeen is \u00a3109 return, \u00a3185 sleeper standard to Inverness, and \u00a32 more to Aberdeen. Travelling by day to Inverness and Aberdeen with a ticket booked seven days in advance only costs \u00a355 return, while turning up on the day will cost \u00a392.50 and \u00a390.50 respectively. Brighton-London Taking a train from Brighton to London for the day, you can save money if you travel to a London terminus rather than add a tube journey. For example, if you travel to Farringdon via Thameslink after 9am it will cost you \u00a314.60, but Brighton to Blackfriars - a 10-minute walk away - is \u00a312 return. It also pays to save money using network cards. For \u00a320 a year the Network railcard gives you a third off travel when catching virtually any weekday train after 10am in the south-east of England area or at any time at weekends. Milton Keynes-Farringdon A daily return from Milton Keynes to Farringdon costs \u00a310.55 with a network card but an extra \u00a31.35 each day without. There are further discount railcards for other groups. Whenever you travel with children, a family railcard gives you one-third off the adult fares and applies to most national tickets. The card costs \u00a320 for the year and then all children under 16 years can enjoy 60% off the normal child fare. For 16-25 year olds an \u00a318-a-year young persons railcard will save one-third on most rail fares, a similar deal to the senior Railcard for people aged 60-plus. Compensation you can expect for the delays By the end of January thousands of people will have claimed compensation, as operators like GNER are giving its season ticket customers 22 days' free travel. Connex, South Central and Scotrail, Central East are giving 15 days' and Silverlink's Northampton line and Southwest trains will both get 16 days' free travel, Virgin CrossCountry 21 days free. Many other rail operators are offering similar compensation. But one-off journeys can attract compensation as well. The train has to be delayed by one hour or more over the official timetable in force. And you must complain - don't expect the train operators to offer you a form voluntarily. Will you be hit by the New Year increases? Not all operators will be increasing fares tomorrow. Some will hold off until Easter when services should be back to normal and others will try to rebuild customer numbers with cut-price deals. GNER will hold prices. Connex will give reductions on some season ticket prices. Virgin is freezing all prices and Thameslink is not increasing season tickets, although daily fares will increase by an average of 2.3%, and off-peak fares will rise by up to 4%. All fares on Scotrail will rise by 2.3% and Southwest trains are putting prices up by an average of 2.4%.",

Christina Wilson, who claimed she had been paid thousands of pounds to dress as a schoolgirl for kinky sex, cried out \"It's so unfair\" from the dock at Lincoln crown court as sentence was passed. She was told by Judge Jonathan Teare that she had \"mercilessly milked money\" from former shipping agent John Weissberger, 63, by spinning a web of lies to persuade him to make her huge loans. The retired widower, who met Wilson after advertising in a lonely hearts column, was made to believe that his new friend was a Hollywood screenwriter, a suddenly bereaved mother, and the victim of breast implants which had gone wrong. As well as lying repeatedly about being a BBC playwright and having to bring an orphaned grandson back from Canada, the alleged former beauty queen and opera singer also laid siege to Mr Weissberger's reputation in court. Her counsel, David Farrell QC, showed photographs of her wearing fake pigtails and bending over to be smacked, allegedly taken by Mr Weissberger in exchange for cash. The smears were denied by Mr Weissberger and dismissed by Judge Teare yesterday.

The judge ridiculed home-made security bonds offered to Mr Weissberger as security for loans of up to \u00a394,000 and described Wilson's whole approach to her victim as a sham. As well as concocting lies about a \u00a39m Hollywood deal and a daughter's death on holiday, she invented a story about expecting compensation for a failed breast implant operation to extract more cash. The lies had tricked Mr Weissberger into making at least 12 payments which left him almost destitute and having to put up his house at Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, for sale.

One of the fastest growing chains in the UK with centres offering deals with local employers. </p> <p><b> The muscle</b> <br>The London Barbican Holmes Place has a huge range of machines, running track, banks of televisions, workout rooms, 25m pool, sauna, jacuzzis and steam rooms, plus free towels. </p> <p><b> The financial pain</b> <br>Refuses to disclose precise charges \"because it depends on an individual's circumstances and which company they work for\". The London Barbican centre charges a joining fee of \u00a340-\u00a3250 and monthly fees of \u00a340 (off-peak) to \u00a376 (peak). Total for one year: \u00a3858-\u00a31,162. </p> <p><b> The reality</b> <br>Impressive, high-quality, facilities, upbeat, lively and efficient atmosphere - at a price. Very office-worker oriented - quiet during daytime but approaches overcrowding in evenings. Good value, popular restaurant, though somewhat worn-out looking.<br><b> Patrick Collinson</b> </p> <p> <b> David Lloyd Leisure </b></p> <p><b> Location</b> <br>46 clubs in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p> <p><b> The image</b> <br>The UK's largest chain of health and fitness clubs with 200,000 members. Recently added 12 Curzon clubs in London and 50 Marriott Hotel Country Clubs to its portfolio. Emphasises racquet sports and family membership. </p> <p><b> The muscle</b> <br>The club at Castle Farm in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of the group's largest with five indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, 25m indoor pool with sauna, steam room, and children's pool, fully equipped gym, separate free weights room, aerobic dance studio and creche. </p> <p><b> The financial pain</b> <br>One-off joining fees range from \u00a3200-\u00a3400, with some clubs running special offers during January. Monthly membership costs range from \u00a348-\u00a3127 with discounts for senior citizens, students and children. Total cost to join the Newcastle club for one year (excluding racquet sports): \u00a3687. </p> <p><b> The reality</b> <br>Impressive facilities and enough capacity to satisfy demand at even the busiest periods. The Newcastle centre has worked hard at creating a \"clubby\" atmosphere with its classes and active social programme of evening events. The club is also trying to become more family-friendly with weekend lessons for children, which makes the shameful rule that only able-bodied adults can eat in the carpeted area of the restaurant all the more absurd. <br><b> Ian Wylie</b> </p> <p> <b> Cannon's </b></p> <p><b> Location</b> <br>38 centres, many in London but including Liverpool, Portsmouth, Swindon and other clubs across England and Wales. The same group also runs the exclusive Harbour club in London and 'Courtney' gyms attached to public recreation centres across the UK. </p> <p><b> The image</b> <br>Strong reputation as one of the first 'luxury' gym clubs opened in the 1980s, it remains at the top-end of the gym world, although other chains now largely match Cannon's facilities. </p> <p><b> The muscle</b> <br>Most centres have wide range of machines, rooms and pools. Coombe Grove Manor, an exclusive country club and hotel outside Bath has a Cannon's gym, aimed at families rather than corporate membership, with gym, in and outdoor swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, aerobic studio, four tennis courts and a golf course. Beauty facilities come as extras. </p> <p><b> The financial pain</b> <br>Coombe has a joining fee of \u00a3150 but this is being waived at the moment, plus a one off payment of \u00a3750 for the year. The Cannon's Connection card gives access to all 38 gyms at \u00a3100 joining fee and \u00a378 a month, making a total for the year of \u00a31,036. The Harbour club is \u00a3775 plus \u00a3100 per month, total \u00a31,995. </p> <p><b> The reality</b> <br>\"This gym is very hard to fault\" says Bianca Bridges a member of Coombe. The staff are very friendly and when you join you are given a fitness assessment and programme. \"The setting and environment is perfect for a fitness/health club,\" says Ms Bridges. Perfection comes at a high price. <br><b> Juliet Shedden</b> </p> <p> <b> Fitness First </b></p> <p><b> Location</b> <br>13 centres, London and Manchester. </p> <p><b> The image </b> <br>Fitness First, owned by ex-squash star Mike Corby, operates 13 gyms, all but one of which is in London (Manchester opened this year). Just three are open at weekends and have a pool. The group is one of the only independently-owned gym chains in the country and its brand image is middle market and friendly. </p> <p><b> The muscle</b> <br>The Tottenham Court Road branch in London has a 14m pool, small sauna and steam cubicles, two aerobic studios holding an average of 56 classes a week and a large gym area with cardio-vascular, cross-training and weight training sections. </p> <p><b> The financial pain</b> <br>The joining fee is \u00a3150 plus a monthly fee of \u00a370.50 for peak membership and \u00a346.50 off-peak and this includes all classes bar a couple of esoteric martial arts sessions. Total for one year (peak time): \u00a3996. </p> <p><b> The reality</b> <br>The gym has a friendly feel and the staff seem both knowledgeable and genuinely caring. The pool is a reasonable size and one side of it is laned off. On the downside, the gym feels more utilitarian than luxurious, the changing rooms are carpeted which feel and look unpleasant and the studios are not soundproofed, so if you take a Pilates class you will hear the step teacher next door barking instructions. <br><b> Liz Stuart </b></p> <p><b> YMCA</b> </p> <p><b> Location</b> <br>29 gyms around the UK, including Bolton, Doncaster, Manchester, Plymouth, Sheffield and West Bromwich. </p> <p><b> The image</b> <br>The 'value' end of the market, focusing on core facilities rather than free towels and jacuzzis. Each centre is autonomous and equipment and facilities vary markedly. </p> <p><b> The muscle</b> <br>The Central YMCA in London (Great Russell St), the organisation's biggest gym, boasts a full-size 25m swimming pool, machine and free weights rooms, a sports hall for badminton and basketball, several step/workout rooms offering a vast array of classes - and a chapel. </p> <p><b> The financial pain</b> <br>The joining fee is \u00a385 plus an annual fee of \u00a3420 for peak membership, \u00a3300 off-peak. Total for one year: \u00a3505. Considerable discounts for under-26s and senior citizens. </p> <p><b> The reality</b> <br>Rapidly improving worn-out facilities after competition from the new gym chains, although running/rowing/cycling machines still less numerous than other (admittedly much pricier) gyms. Plus points include a general inclusivity - a broader mix of young, old, ethnic and disabled than other gyms - and the quality of its fitness instructors, as it is the centre which trains most trainers. <br><b> Patrick Collinson</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Holmes Place Location 42 centres, many in London but also in Bristol, Poole, Milton Keynes, Nottingham and opening shortly in Birmingham and Manchester. The image Upmarket but more quality four-star than luxury five-star. One of the fastest growing chains in the UK with centres offering deals with local employers. The muscle The London Barbican Holmes Place has a huge range of machines, running track, banks of televisions, workout rooms, 25m pool, sauna, jacuzzis and steam rooms, plus free towels. The financial pain Refuses to disclose precise charges \"because it depends on an individual's circumstances and which company they work for\". The London Barbican centre charges a joining fee of \u00a340-\u00a3250 and monthly fees of \u00a340 (off-peak) to \u00a376 (peak). Total for one year: \u00a3858-\u00a31,162. The reality Impressive, high-quality, facilities, upbeat, lively and efficient atmosphere - at a price. Very office-worker oriented - quiet during daytime but approaches overcrowding in evenings. Good value, popular restaurant, though somewhat worn-out looking. Patrick Collinson David Lloyd Leisure Location 46 clubs in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The image The UK's largest chain of health and fitness clubs with 200,000 members. Recently added 12 Curzon clubs in London and 50 Marriott Hotel Country Clubs to its portfolio. Emphasises racquet sports and family membership. The muscle The club at Castle Farm in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of the group's largest with five indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, 25m indoor pool with sauna, steam room, and children's pool, fully equipped gym, separate free weights room, aerobic dance studio and creche. The financial pain One-off joining fees range from \u00a3200-\u00a3400, with some clubs running special offers during January. Monthly membership costs range from \u00a348-\u00a3127 with discounts for senior citizens, students and children. Total cost to join the Newcastle club for one year (excluding racquet sports): \u00a3687. The reality Impressive facilities and enough capacity to satisfy demand at even the busiest periods. The Newcastle centre has worked hard at creating a \"clubby\" atmosphere with its classes and active social programme of evening events. The club is also trying to become more family-friendly with weekend lessons for children, which makes the shameful rule that only able-bodied adults can eat in the carpeted area of the restaurant all the more absurd. Ian Wylie Cannon's Location 38 centres, many in London but including Liverpool, Portsmouth, Swindon and other clubs across England and Wales. The same group also runs the exclusive Harbour club in London and 'Courtney' gyms attached to public recreation centres across the UK. The image Strong reputation as one of the first 'luxury' gym clubs opened in the 1980s, it remains at the top-end of the gym world, although other chains now largely match Cannon's facilities. The muscle Most centres have wide range of machines, rooms and pools. Coombe Grove Manor, an exclusive country club and hotel outside Bath has a Cannon's gym, aimed at families rather than corporate membership, with gym, in and outdoor swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, aerobic studio, four tennis courts and a golf course. Beauty facilities come as extras. The financial pain Coombe has a joining fee of \u00a3150 but this is being waived at the moment, plus a one off payment of \u00a3750 for the year. The Cannon's Connection card gives access to all 38 gyms at \u00a3100 joining fee and \u00a378 a month, making a total for the year of \u00a31,036. The Harbour club is \u00a3775 plus \u00a3100 per month, total \u00a31,995. The reality \"This gym is very hard to fault\" says Bianca Bridges a member of Coombe. The staff are very friendly and when you join you are given a fitness assessment and programme. \"The setting and environment is perfect for a fitness/health club,\" says Ms Bridges. Perfection comes at a high price. Juliet Shedden Fitness First Location 13 centres, London and Manchester. The image Fitness First, owned by ex-squash star Mike Corby, operates 13 gyms, all but one of which is in London (Manchester opened this year). Just three are open at weekends and have a pool. The group is one of the only independently-owned gym chains in the country and its brand image is middle market and friendly. The muscle The Tottenham Court Road branch in London has a 14m pool, small sauna and steam cubicles, two aerobic studios holding an average of 56 classes a week and a large gym area with cardio-vascular, cross-training and weight training sections. The financial pain The joining fee is \u00a3150 plus a monthly fee of \u00a370.50 for peak membership and \u00a346.50 off-peak and this includes all classes bar a couple of esoteric martial arts sessions. Total for one year (peak time): \u00a3996. The reality The gym has a friendly feel and the staff seem both knowledgeable and genuinely caring. The pool is a reasonable size and one side of it is laned off. On the downside, the gym feels more utilitarian than luxurious, the changing rooms are carpeted which feel and look unpleasant and the studios are not soundproofed, so if you take a Pilates class you will hear the step teacher next door barking instructions. Liz Stuart YMCA Location 29 gyms around the UK, including Bolton, Doncaster, Manchester, Plymouth, Sheffield and West Bromwich. The image The 'value' end of the market, focusing on core facilities rather than free towels and jacuzzis. Each centre is autonomous and equipment and facilities vary markedly. The muscle The Central YMCA in London (Great Russell St), the organisation's biggest gym, boasts a full-size 25m swimming pool, machine and free weights rooms, a sports hall for badminton and basketball, several step/workout rooms offering a vast array of classes - and a chapel. The financial pain The joining fee is \u00a385 plus an annual fee of \u00a3420 for peak membership, \u00a3300 off-peak. Total for one year: \u00a3505. Considerable discounts for under-26s and senior citizens. The reality Rapidly improving worn-out facilities after competition from the new gym chains, although running/rowing/cycling machines still less numerous than other (admittedly much pricier) gyms. Plus points include a general inclusivity - a broader mix of young, old, ethnic and disabled than other gyms - and the quality of its fitness instructors, as it is the centre which trains most trainers.

The Yediot Ahronot poll put the prime minister, Ehud Barak, on 32% and the Maariv gave him only 22%, reflecting the disillusionment with his handling of the peace negotiations and with the resumption of violence.</p> <p>The increase in support for the right in the polls coincided with a series of protests by Jewish settlers on the West Bank. The settlers are set to join other hardliners in a huge protest outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City on Monday.</p> <p>A statement issued by the organisers yesterday predicted that \"hundreds of thousands\" will attend in a show of solidarity against concessions to the Palestinians offered by Mr Barak.</p> <p>Flights have been chartered to bring in supporters from the United States, Britain, France and Russia, according to the statement.</p> <p>Mr Barak has become such a hate figure for the right that one of his colleagues this week had to make a public appeal to stop the death threats being made against him by fellow Jews.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hagai Ben-Artzi, a rightwing activist and brother-in-law of the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, accused Mr Barak of betraying Israel, during a settlers' demonstration outside the prime minister's residence.</p> <p>Settlers on the West Bank, unnerved by the fatal shooting of Binyamin Kahane, the leader of a rightwing extremist group, on New Year's Eve, have set up their own illegal observation posts and closed off access to Palestinian villages.

      "bodyText": "Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli defence minister vilified by Arabs and the left for his involvement in the Lebanon massacres almost 20 years ago, is cruising to victory in the Israeli prime ministerial election, according to polls published yesterday. The widespread assumption on the left in the country is that victory on February 6 for Mr Sharon, a hawk, will mean the end of the already faltering peace process. Polls published in two Israeli daily newspapers, the Maariv and the Yediot Ahronot, gave Mr Sharon 50% of the vote. The Yediot Ahronot poll put the prime minister, Ehud Barak, on 32% and the Maariv gave him only 22%, reflecting the disillusionment with his handling of the peace negotiations and with the resumption of violence. The increase in support for the right in the polls coincided with a series of protests by Jewish settlers on the West Bank. The settlers are set to join other hardliners in a huge protest outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City on Monday. A statement issued by the organisers yesterday predicted that \"hundreds of thousands\" will attend in a show of solidarity against concessions to the Palestinians offered by Mr Barak. Flights have been chartered to bring in supporters from the United States, Britain, France and Russia, according to the statement. Mr Barak has become such a hate figure for the right that one of his colleagues this week had to make a public appeal to stop the death threats being made against him by fellow Jews. Meanwhile, Hagai Ben-Artzi, a rightwing activist and brother-in-law of the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, accused Mr Barak of betraying Israel, during a settlers' demonstration outside the prime minister's residence. Settlers on the West Bank, unnerved by the fatal shooting of Binyamin Kahane, the leader of a rightwing extremist group, on New Year's Eve, have set up their own illegal observation posts and closed off access to Palestinian villages. The armed settlers claim these actions are necessary for their own protection. At Ofra, a Jewish settlement near the spot where Mr Kahane and his wife were ambushed by Palestinian gunmen, the settlers have taken over a hilltop looking down on the main road and out over the Palestinian village of Ein Yabrud. If the proposals put forward by the US president, Bill Clinton, were to be adopted, many of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank, such as Ofra, will have to be abandoned, and control passed to the Palestinian Authority. A large Israeli flag has been defiantly hoisted above the Ofra post, which has attracted a steady stream of visitors from Israel to show support. The settlers also used a digger to put mounds of earth across the access roads to Ein Yabrud, blocking in the Palestinians. Mr Sharon, less at home in front of television cameras than Mr Barak, has had a low-key campaign, giving few interviews. He published his plan for a peace settlement this week in the Jerusalem Post, promising to accede to the demands of the settlers and right-wingers: Jerusalem will not be divided and the settlers will not be forced to uproot from the West Bank. Mr Sharon, while defence minister in 1982, initiated the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. He was forced to resign after a commission of inquiry found him to be indirectly responsible for the massacres by Christian militia of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Shatilla camps, near Beirut. Mr Barak's campaign team was forced to apologise to Mr Sharon yesterday for placing an advertisement in the Arab press showing scenes from the massacres and asking: \"Who knows [Mr Sharon's history] more than you?\" Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Palestinian national authority Ehud Barak's office White House Israeli government Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel Hamas Interactive Interactive history of Israel",

By 2001, according to Miss Elf, the world would be one, big, happy, cappuccino-coloured family. I remember her drawing this frontier-less world. How the chalk dust flew! </p> <p> Miss Elf was a passionate and committed teacher. In fact, not long after I left school she was committed to the High Towers mental hospital, following a doomed staff-room romance with Podgy Perkins, the games master. He was married with seven children, all boys. (Interestingly, all the boys' names began with G.) Strange what the memory throws up. </p> <p> Anyway, Miss Elf envisaged that, by 2001, there would be no hunger in the world and that everybody would have access to clean water and a flushing toilet. She drew a typical 2001 world family on the board, using a fresh box of coloured chalks. They all had brown skin and wore white, shiny, body-suits with pointy shoulders. Attached to their ankles were tiny jet engines. These devices enabled the 2001 family to fly like the birds. Though, as she pointed out, intercontinental travel would necessitate many refuelling stops. </p> <p> Perhaps it is a good thing that Miss Elf is gibbering behind the high walls of an institution. She would be heartbroken to know that her utopian vision is as far away as ever, and that Israel and Palestine are still arguing the toss. </p> <p> <strong> New Year Resolutions </strong><br></p> <p> 1.

Perhaps the Dome was worth a billion pounds. <br> 4. I will look into the Buddhist religion with a view to becoming a cohort. I have always had a horror of treading on insects. Ants in particular. <br> 5. I will attempt to fall in love with a suitable woman this year. One that doesn't cry a lot or use too much blue eye shadow. <br> 6. I'll teach my son's the proper use of the apostrophe. <br> </p> <p><strong> Tuesday, January 2 </strong><br></p> <p> Pandora is back from Israel where she claimed to be on a fact-finding mission about Jerusalem.

I would find it difficult to swim with goldfish. </p> <p> I asked her if she was any nearer to achieving her medium-term goal, that of becoming foreign secretary. She tossed her treacle-coloured hair back and said, \"It's acknowledged by those that count - Ian Hislop, Auberon Waugh and Andrew Rawnsley - that Robin's got to go. The man is now totally incomprehensible. How poor bloody foreigners understand his mad gabble, God only knows.\"</p>",

Miss Elf was a passionate and committed teacher. In fact, not long after I left school she was committed to the High Towers mental hospital, following a doomed staff-room romance with Podgy Perkins, the games master. He was married with seven children, all boys. (Interestingly, all the boys' names began with G.) Strange what the memory throws up. Anyway, Miss Elf envisaged that, by 2001, there would be no hunger in the world and that everybody would have access to clean water and a flushing toilet. She drew a typical 2001 world family on the board, using a fresh box of coloured chalks. They all had brown skin and wore white, shiny, body-suits with pointy shoulders. Attached to their ankles were tiny jet engines. These devices enabled the 2001 family to fly like the birds. Though, as she pointed out, intercontinental travel would necessitate many refuelling stops. Perhaps it is a good thing that Miss Elf is gibbering behind the high walls of an institution. She would be heartbroken to know that her utopian vision is as far away as ever, and that Israel and Palestine are still arguing the toss. New Year Resolutions 1. I will try and secure the services of Dame Helena Kennedy in a bid to get my mother out of prison. 2. I will persist in trying to get my serial killer comedy, The White Van, made by the BBC. 3. I will try to be less judgmental. Perhaps Jeffrey Archer is innocent. Perhaps the Dome was worth a billion pounds. 4. I will look into the Buddhist religion with a view to becoming a cohort. I have always had a horror of treading on insects. Ants in particular. 5. I will attempt to fall in love with a suitable woman this year. One that doesn't cry a lot or use too much blue eye shadow. 6. I'll teach my son's the proper use of the apostrophe. Tuesday, January 2 Pandora is back from Israel where she claimed to be on a fact-finding mission about Jerusalem. I remarked on her tan. She said, \"Yeah, I managed to get a few days off in Eilat, swimming with the dolphins.\" How I envy Pandora's physical prowess! I would find it difficult to swim with goldfish. I asked her if she was any nearer to achieving her medium-term goal, that of becoming foreign secretary. She tossed her treacle-coloured hair back and said, \"It's acknowledged by those that count - Ian Hislop, Auberon Waugh and Andrew Rawnsley - that Robin's got to go. The man is now totally incomprehensible. How poor bloody foreigners understand his mad gabble, God only knows.\"",

At the centre of the chancellor's ambitious plan, which reflects his conviction that Britain will escape the expected economic downturn in the US, are negotiations already under way with the IT industry to create training opportunities that will ease skill shortages in a cutting-edge industry - and create high-wage jobs.

      "body": "<p>I have always had doubts about certain aspects of e-commerce, especially e-retailing. Unlike America, which is vast with a lot of people living in the middle of nowhere, and therefore a good market for internet shopping, Britain is a small, overcrowded island with a supermarket on almost every corner, and agencies for booking holidays and trips out in most high streets.</p> <p>People like to go to the supermarket to feel the quality of the plums, and it will be a long while before internet shopping really catches on over here, I believe. If my theory is correct then the arguments should also apply to auctions. People, especially if they are serious and specialised collectors like to feel and see what they are buying.</p> <p>The big four auction houses Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips and Bonhams &amp; Brooks all have online sales in one form and another, and do not feel they form part of the dot.com boom and bust. Firstly, they are very much an add-on to existing business. Bonhams &amp; Brooks and Sotheby's say online sales could amount to around one-third of overall turnover in the medium term.</p> <p>Second, collecting is truly an international business, although this can also be said of QXL and E-Bay clienteles. But the fine art, antique and collectibles fraternities consist of groups of people with specific interests and usually a fine appreciation of value. Thirdly, online auctions allow offerings from a much wider supply chain than an in-house sale. Sotheby's draws on 2,300 associates, namely dealers and smaller auctions houses.</p> <p>Not everything lends itself to sales online. As Georgina Petrie at Sotheby's says: \"Heavy furniture, because of the shipping costs which go by weight, does not go well with online sales.\" Small ceramic pieces, however, would seem ideal. I was interested therefore to track the online sale at Sotheby's of Royal Doulton and Beswick which ran from December 5 to December 29. It was surprisingly easy to follow.

      "bodyText": "I have always had doubts about certain aspects of e-commerce, especially e-retailing. Unlike America, which is vast with a lot of people living in the middle of nowhere, and therefore a good market for internet shopping, Britain is a small, overcrowded island with a supermarket on almost every corner, and agencies for booking holidays and trips out in most high streets. People like to go to the supermarket to feel the quality of the plums, and it will be a long while before internet shopping really catches on over here, I believe. If my theory is correct then the arguments should also apply to auctions. People, especially if they are serious and specialised collectors like to feel and see what they are buying. The big four auction houses Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips and Bonhams &amp; Brooks all have online sales in one form and another, and do not feel they form part of the dot.com boom and bust. Firstly, they are very much an add-on to existing business. Bonhams &amp; Brooks and Sotheby's say online sales could amount to around one-third of overall turnover in the medium term. Second, collecting is truly an international business, although this can also be said of QXL and E-Bay clienteles. But the fine art, antique and collectibles fraternities consist of groups of people with specific interests and usually a fine appreciation of value. Thirdly, online auctions allow offerings from a much wider supply chain than an in-house sale. Sotheby's draws on 2,300 associates, namely dealers and smaller auctions houses. Not everything lends itself to sales online. As Georgina Petrie at Sotheby's says: \"Heavy furniture, because of the shipping costs which go by weight, does not go well with online sales.\" Small ceramic pieces, however, would seem ideal. I was interested therefore to track the online sale at Sotheby's of Royal Doulton and Beswick which ran from December 5 to December 29. It was surprisingly easy to follow. You have to register if you want to bid. Click on to www.sothebys.com click special auctions, and get up Doulton and Beswick. There are illustrations. It tells you who is offering the piece.

Numbers climbed after he began practising in Hyde, Greater Manchester, two years later.</p> <p>By 1998, when a few of his murders came to light after a complaint about a forged will, the total of \"excess deaths\" of patients in his care had reached 297, possibly as many as 345.</p> <p>The audit of his chilling career as a GP was conducted by Richard Baker, a professor in the general practice and primary care department at Leicester University.</p> <p>After comparing the medical records, death certificates and cremation forms of Shipman's patients with those of comparable local GPs, he said he was particularly concerned about 236 \"excess deaths\" among Shipman's patients who died at home or in his practice premises. This was probably the figure that came closest to estimating the doctor's full death toll, he said.</p> <p>Prof Baker paid closest attention to the period after 1985 when fuller records were available. Shipman issued 324 medical certificates of cause of death and the audit was able to track clinical records of 288 of these patients. Prof Baker concluded that 166 of the deaths were \"highly suspicious\" and 43 were \"moderately suspicious\", in that they shared characteristics similar to the 15 murders of which Shipman was convicted last year.</p> <p>The figures suggest that more than half of the patients who died while under the doctor's care during this period were killed by him. Most of the established murder victims were older women who died suddenly at home - usually in the afternoon. Shipman was present at the death or attended shortly before death.</p> <p>A review of death certificates he signed showed that a disproportionate number were women over 75.</p> <p>\"Most died at home and had either been seen within one day of death or with Shipman present at death. The clinical histories given by Shipman often did not relate convincingly to the certified cause of death and evidence to corroborate the cause of death from other doctors was frequently not available,\" the report said.</p> <p>Shipman commonly said deaths were due to heart problems, stroke or old age. He was 25 times more likely than comparable GPs to be present at death - attending in 20% of cases compared with a norm of 0.8%. Relatives were present at 40% of his patients' deaths, compared with 80% for other doctors. And 60% of his patients took less than 30 minutes to die, compared with a norm of 23%.</p> <p>Prof Baker drew attention to suspicious comments recorded by Shipman on cremation forms. In one case Shipman wrote: \"Saw patient at home, diagnosis made, arranged admission ambulance, patient dead when went back, all within 10 minutes.\"</p> <p>The professor said this record was particularly odd because it should have been standard practice to try to resuscitate a patient until the ambulance arrived.</p> <p>Perhaps the most extraordinary clue to Shipman's irregularity was the timing of his patients' deaths, peaking abnormally between 2pm and 6pm in sharp contrast to the more regular pattern experienced by other doctors. \"It is impossible to come up with a logical [legitimate] explanation of why so many patients die in the afternoon,\" Prof Baker said.</p> <p>Although most of Shipman's victims were women, the report found the deaths of 21 men were highly suspicious. \"On the basis of the review of surviving records there is considerable reason for concern about the cause of death of substantially more patients than those of which Shipman was convicted,\" it said. Prof Baker said his evidence was circumstantial and it would be up to the police and prosecution service to investigate the cases of individual victims.</p> <p>The report found Shipman's record-keeping was consistently poor. \"His writing was sometimes illegible, but of greater concern was the lack of detail he recorded about patients presenting complaints and his clinical management.\"</p> <p>A review of a small sample should have disclosed the problem. In some cases his use of inadequate records could be regarded as a deliberate ploy to conceal illegal activities, but it was impossible to judge thow far he fabricated entries.</p> <p>Prof Baker was unable to reach firm conclusions on how Shipman obtained all the diamorphine he used to administer lethal doses to the patients whose deaths were suspicious. The doctor did not maintain a prescribed drugs register. The report concluded: \"There was a clear rise in the numbers of deaths towards the end of Shipman's career...It was not surprising therefore that his activities eventually attracted attention.\"</p> <p>A pattern emerged showing relatively low death rates during Shipman's first year at Todmorden and in the Hyde group practice. There were also few deaths between 1990 and 1992 when he left the group practice and set up alone. There was also evidence of clusters of deaths during shorter periods. They were more likely on certain weekdays. Occasionally several would occur on the same day or within a few days of each other.</p> <p>The audit was commissioned by Alan Milburn, the health secretary, at the time of the verdict on Shipman last January. He asked Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, to organise a review of Shipman's practice from 1974 to 1998 without trying to gather additional forensic evidence.</p> <p>Prof Baker said he had not been asked to come up with recommendations, but did so out of a sense of rage as a professional that Shipman had betrayed the trust of so many people who depended on him. The seven recommendations include routine monitoring of GPs' patient death rates, checks on their standard of record-keeping and more information on death certificates.</p> <p>Prof Donaldson said: \"This review is unprecedented in its remit. The analysis makes chilling reading...Everything points to the fact that a doctor with the sinister and macabre motivation of Harold Shipman is a once in a lifetime occurrence... [but] there is much to be learned from this tragedy.\"</p> <p>He said Prof Baker's recommendations would be considered by the judicial inquiry that was set up in September to look into the circumstances of Shipman's crimes.</p>",

The figures suggest that more than half of the patients who died while under the doctor's care during this period were killed by him. Most of the established murder victims were older women who died suddenly at home - usually in the afternoon. Shipman was present at the death or attended shortly before death. A review of death certificates he signed showed that a disproportionate number were women over 75. \"Most died at home and had either been seen within one day of death or with Shipman present at death. The clinical histories given by Shipman often did not relate convincingly to the certified cause of death and evidence to corroborate the cause of death from other doctors was frequently not available,\" the report said. Shipman commonly said deaths were due to heart problems, stroke or old age. He was 25 times more likely than comparable GPs to be present at death - attending in 20% of cases compared with a norm of 0.8%. Relatives were present at 40% of his patients' deaths, compared with 80% for other doctors. And 60% of his patients took less than 30 minutes to die, compared with a norm of 23%. Prof Baker drew attention to suspicious comments recorded by Shipman on cremation forms. In one case Shipman wrote: \"Saw patient at home, diagnosis made, arranged admission ambulance, patient dead when went back, all within 10 minutes.\" The professor said this record was particularly odd because it should have been standard practice to try to resuscitate a patient until the ambulance arrived. Perhaps the most extraordinary clue to Shipman's irregularity was the timing of his patients' deaths, peaking abnormally between 2pm and 6pm in sharp contrast to the more regular pattern experienced by other doctors. \"It is impossible to come up with a logical [legitimate] explanation of why so many patients die in the afternoon,\" Prof Baker said. Although most of Shipman's victims were women, the report found the deaths of 21 men were highly suspicious. \"On the basis of the review of surviving records there is considerable reason for concern about the cause of death of substantially more patients than those of which Shipman was convicted,\" it said. Prof Baker said his evidence was circumstantial and it would be up to the police and prosecution service to investigate the cases of individual victims. The report found Shipman's record-keeping was consistently poor. \"His writing was sometimes illegible, but of greater concern was the lack of detail he recorded about patients presenting complaints and his clinical management.\" A review of a small sample should have disclosed the problem. In some cases his use of inadequate records could be regarded as a deliberate ploy to conceal illegal activities, but it was impossible to judge thow far he fabricated entries. Prof Baker was unable to reach firm conclusions on how Shipman obtained all the diamorphine he used to administer lethal doses to the patients whose deaths were suspicious. The doctor did not maintain a prescribed drugs register. The report concluded: \"There was a clear rise in the numbers of deaths towards the end of Shipman's career...It was not surprising therefore that his activities eventually attracted attention.\" A pattern emerged showing relatively low death rates during Shipman's first year at Todmorden and in the Hyde group practice. There were also few deaths between 1990 and 1992 when he left the group practice and set up alone. There was also evidence of clusters of deaths during shorter periods. They were more likely on certain weekdays. Occasionally several would occur on the same day or within a few days of each other. The audit was commissioned by Alan Milburn, the health secretary, at the time of the verdict on Shipman last January. He asked Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer, to organise a review of Shipman's practice from 1974 to 1998 without trying to gather additional forensic evidence. Prof Baker said he had not been asked to come up with recommendations, but did so out of a sense of rage as a professional that Shipman had betrayed the trust of so many people who depended on him. The seven recommendations include routine monitoring of GPs' patient death rates, checks on their standard of record-keeping and more information on death certificates. Prof Donaldson said: \"This review is unprecedented in its remit. The analysis makes chilling reading...Everything points to the fact that a doctor with the sinister and macabre motivation of Harold Shipman is a once in a lifetime occurrence... [but] there is much to be learned from this tragedy.\" He said Prof Baker's recommendations would be considered by the judicial inquiry that was set up in September to look into the circumstances of Shipman's crimes.",

In fact, he seems genuinely fond of the cloned animal. \"For a sheep, she has quite a strong personality,\" James says. \"It's because she's been around people so much.\" </p> <p>He believes Dolly considers herself a supermodel among sheep: \"She's a prima donna - she knows she's famous and she poses for the cameras. She starts baa-ing furiously when you turn your back to look at any of the other animals.\" </p> <p>The birth of Dolly, the world's first cloned sheep, catapulted the tiny Scottish biotechnology firm PPL Therapeutics into the headlines in 1997 and doubled the value of the company's shares overnight. </p> <p>Dolly was followed in 1998 by a cloned cow, Mr Jefferson, and by a litter of cloned piglets last year. Debates about research on stem cells, and about genetic modification, have kept the company in the spotlight ever since. </p> <p>James, 60, who is managing director of PPL, has always been willing to discuss the ethics of cloning animals from a single cell. However, he emphasises that the company's aim is not the cloning itself, but to alter animals so that they produce useful drugs, and even human organs. </p> <p>He says: \"Our aim is to make drugs, and to make money. The fact that we use animals to do it is interesting, but it's not what it's all about.\" </p> <p>Although a scientist by training, James's background lies firmly in the business world. Brought up in suburban Middlesex, his hopes of going to university were dashed by the death of his father. James left school for a job in the labs at Glaxo Wellcome, to help support his mother and sister, but found time to do a part-time degree in chemistry at Birkbeck College. </p> <p>With support from Glaxo, he moved on to study for a doctorate in chemistry, under the tutelage of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Derek Barton. But he was more interested in practical applications than pure research. Moving to Wilkinson Sword, he developed lubricant coatings for razors. </p> <p>He also helped design different bangs for fireworks - another Wilkinson activity at the time - before getting a job looking for hi-tech business opportunities for the Prudential's venture capital arm. It was at the Prudential, during the mid-1980s, that he had the idea which led to PPL. \"We were looking for cheap ways of making proteins,\" he recalls. \"I had this mad idea we could make them in frogs' eggs.\" </p> <p>Frogs proved impractical, so his attention shifted to chickens. James and his colleagues then pooled their resources with the Roslin Institute, an academic outfit just outside Edinburgh which was already researching transgenic sheep. </p> <p>\"Mad ideas take you to sensible propositions,\" he says. \"It's called brainstorming.\" </p> <p>Initially, the attraction of producing medicines in animals was cost. Rather than building vast hi-tech factories, drugs could, quite literally, be made on a farm. More recently, however, the company has realised that a bigger advantage lies in volume - animals can secrete proteins in much greater quantities than machines. </p> <p>\"If you push artificial production too hard, you run out of chemistry sets. The advantage of our method is that you've got huge quantities of proteins available.\" </p> <p>PPL's leading project is to breed thousands of sheep with an added gene which makes them produce milk containing a protein called AAT. Once purified, this can be given to humans to treat a deficiency of protein in the lungs, or to treat cystic fibrosis. </p> <p>The sheep are kept outside Edinburgh on a site which, to the untrained eye, looks like an ordinary farm. In fact, it is built on prime arable land which was previously used for crops, rather than grazing. This is to reduce the risk of scrapies, or other animal diseases, in the soil. </p> <p>Bleating new-born lambs are warmed at PPL's factory by electric heaters, and enjoy higher quality food than they would on any ordinary farm. However, there are plenty of reminders that this is a profit-seeking business, rather than a sanctuary. PPL admits, for example, that all male lambs are incinerated at birth, because they produce no milk and, as genetically altered animals, cannot be used for food. </p> <p>James says: \"If you're prepared to eat lamb, you shouldn't be concerned about what we do. There are strict vegetarians out there who will take a higher moralistic point of view, but that's not one shared by the majority of the population.\" </p> <p>Alongside the farm sits an operating theatre, where the \"parents\" of each flock of transgenic sheep are created by scientists who add genes to embryos within pregnant sheep. Critics point out that this experimental work produces a very high death rate - Dolly, for example, was the only animal successfully born from 10 pregnancies.</p> <p>James admits that \"genetic abnormalities\" can occur. So how many animals are born abnormal? \"Taking all the experiments we've done, I would guess it would probably be about half.\" </p> <p>Most of these victims have internal disorders, such as kidney malfunctions. James says: \"There's been nothing you'd regard as being a monster. We haven't produced animals with two legs, or three heads, or anything like that.\" </p> <p>He continues: \"You have to look at whether the end justifies the means.</p> <p>\"What's more important - a small number of sheep involved in our earlier experiments, or the large number of adolescents who are going to die from cystic fibrosis?\" </p> <p>These days, PPL is working on a huge number of different transgenic animals - including rabbits, chickens and cows. The company has faced the odd demonstration from environmental objectors. James recalls: \"At one point, four people turned up and stood outside with four policemen.\" </p> <p>On May Day last year, an environmental group asked its members to go and copulate on the lawn outside PPL's head office. \"We could've sold some tickets and made some money,\" says James. \"Unfortunately, it never materialised.\" </p> <p>A bigger threat is from the City, which has at times shown impatience towards the company. Its shares, 192p yesterday, have never recaptured the 450p peak which they hit amid the hype of Dolly's birth. </p> <p>James says the hype surrounding Dolly was double-edged for PPL, because it cast the company as \"a bunch of clever scientists doing interesting things with animals\", rather than a pharmaceuticals firm. \"It took us quite a long time to reposition ourselves as a company producing therapeutic drugs,\" he says. </p> <p>Like most biotech companies, PPL is haemorrhaging cash. It lost \u00a314.4m last year, despite a cost-cutting drive which involved 80 redundancies. </p> <p>Critics complain that for a lead product, AAT has a limited market, and that PPL has insufficient cash to last until the commercial launch of its first product, which will be in 2004 at the earliest. James admits: \"We will need more money before we get to break-even.\" </p> <p>So, given the risks of its technology, would PPL be better off as a research offshoot of a large, wealthy pharmaceuticals corporation? James is open-minded: \"Should the company remain independent? Who can tell. There are certainly times when I've wished we hadn't been on the stock market but in reality, we had to be. </p> <p>\"At the time we floated, in the mid-1990s, there wasn't enough venture capital available privately to allow us to begin clinical trials.\" </p> <p>A marketing deal with Bayer boosted PPL's credibility last year - the German pharmaceuticals firm will market AAT, in return for a share of profits. </p> <p>Beyond AAT, James points out that the company has a long pipeline of products. Some of its sheep have been modified to produce a fibrin sealant, used to heal wounds, and research in New Zealand is focusing on producing a multiple sclerosis drug in cows' milk. </p> <p>Then there is the controversial area of xenotransplantation - growing human organs in animals. PPL cloned a litter of pigs last year - named Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom (the last of these is now known as \"Dottie\", its original name having lost its sheen after the collapse of the craze for internet companies). </p> <p>The company is working on \"knocking out\" a gene in these pigs, to make their hearts and livers suitable for transplant into humans. </p> <p>This type of research has raised fears that animal diseases could be introduced to humans. James concedes: \"There are legitimate concerns about ensuring the animals don't have viruses in them.\" </p> <p>He maintains, however, that farmyard animals are sufficiently different from humans to make their diseases incompatible: \"We share more diseases with monkeys than we do with sheep or pigs.\" Genetics has its limits for him, though. He says it is one thing to alter animals to produce life-saving drugs but quite another to produce such creatures as \"anti-freeze salmon\", which can survive colder temperatures. \"The justification there is strictly commercial. In our case, we're also about curing people. That sort of thing at least has the potential to upset the balance of nature. You've got to think long and hard about the consequences.\" </p> <p>As for cloning humans, he says the prospect is pure scaremongering: \"The scientific community has had the ability for 15 years to take a human egg, chop it in half and create another. But there's no good reason to do it.\" </p> <p>He maintains that the risks will always be too high for cloning to become a way of life: \"It will go wrong more often than not. I find it offensive that people think scientists don't have the same sense of responsibility as the rest of the community. Scientists haven't done it in the past, and they won't in the future.\" </p> <p>He complains that fears of creating \"Frankenstein\" are typical of the British attitude towards science: \"There's a presumption of guilt in the UK.

      "bodyText": "French accident investigators probing July's crash of a Concorde near Paris said yesterday that they believed large chunks of rubber from a burst tyre triggered a \"shock wave\" in the fuel tanks, causing the fire that downed the jetliner with the loss of 113 lives. The French accident investigation bureau, BEA, said in its latest update that its original theory - that just before take-off, the Air-France Concorde ran over a strip of metal from a DC10 that had taken off minutes earlier - was \"more and more probable\". But it said that rather than puncturing the aircraft's underwing fuel tank, the chunks of burst tyre may simply have dented it. The explosion that sent the plane spiralling out of control into a hotel in the small town of Gonesse was more likely caused by fuel blowing open the tank from the inside. The investigators said tests would now be carried out on Concorde fuel tanks to confirm their theory, adding that six similar incidents in the past had led to fuel tank ruptures in Concordes at Air France and British Airways. BEA also officially claimed for the first time that the stray strip of metal that burst the tyre came from a Continental Airlines DC10.",

This was hardly surprising. After all, the first response of many dealers to Wednesday's cut was \"who has gone to the wall?\" </p> <p>Moreover, the last time the Fed cut rates in such a manner was in 1998 when the collapse of US hedge fund LTCM threatened to bring down the entire banking system. </p> <p>Yesterday's speculation centred on Bank of America and suggestions that it had taken a bath in the derivatives market. For a while the tale was being taken seriously and the FTSE 100 fell into negative territory on news that trading in Bank of America shares on Wall Street had been suspended. </p> <p>In the event Bank of America quashed the speculation. Nonetheless the damage had been done and the buying interest, which had been so evident in the morning part of the session, evaporated. </p> <p>Matters were not helped by another smattering of profits warnings from the US, which forced Wall Street's leading indices lower. </p> <p>By the time London traders were heading home for the weekend, the Nasdaq was off around 4.34% and the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 2%. </p> <p>Back in London, the final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 12.5 points at 6,198.1, a somewhat misleading figure given that the blue chip index entered the closing auction process around 10 points lower. But, as is becoming all too common, it spiked higher after a couple of big trades were put through the market right on the close. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the Techmark 100 fell 11.24 points 2,448.63, unsettled by the performance of the Nasdaq. </p> <p>Telecoms stocks were having another good session with Deutsche Bank - probably the biggest force in the telecoms sector - encouraging clients to pile into the likes of <strong>Vodafone</strong>, 3.25p better at 242.25p, <strong>Colt Telecom</strong>, up 95p to \u00a316.20, <strong>Fibernet</strong>, 30p higher at 755p, and <strong>BT</strong>, 17p to stronger to 630p. </p> <p>But the award for best blue chip performer of the day went to software developer <strong>Autonomy</strong>, up 225p to \u00a315.35p, after it issued a positive trading statement. </p> <p>Over in the banking sector, there was renewed interest in <strong>Abbey National</strong>, 39p higher at \u00a312.74, following news that <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong>, up 1p to 751p, is seeking clearance from regulators for its proposed takeover. Dealers also heard a late rumour that <strong>HSBC</strong>, off 10p to \u00a310.26, might be poised to enter the fray with an offer for Abbey. </p> <p>On Thursday it was drug stocks and yesterday it was the turn of insurance stocks to be hit by profit taking. After a good run, investors decided that it was time to cash in some of last year's gains. <strong>CGNU</strong> fell by 65p to \u00a310.26, while <strong>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance</strong> dipped 27p to 520.5p. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate ladder, telecoms switch maker <strong> BATM</strong> picked up 11p to 116.5p, with dealers attributing the rise to the clearance of a large stock overhang of some 10m shares on Thursday. <strong>Enterprise Oil</strong> ended 2.25p higher at 570p after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein swiftly placed 8m shares at 553p. </p> <p>At the speculative end of the market, <strong>Psion</strong>, the handheld computer maker, fell 13.5p to 256.5p, hit by renewed speculation that a profits warning was on the way.</p>",

After all, the first response of many dealers to Wednesday's cut was \"who has gone to the wall?\" Moreover, the last time the Fed cut rates in such a manner was in 1998 when the collapse of US hedge fund LTCM threatened to bring down the entire banking system. Yesterday's speculation centred on Bank of America and suggestions that it had taken a bath in the derivatives market. For a while the tale was being taken seriously and the FTSE 100 fell into negative territory on news that trading in Bank of America shares on Wall Street had been suspended. In the event Bank of America quashed the speculation. Nonetheless the damage had been done and the buying interest, which had been so evident in the morning part of the session, evaporated. Matters were not helped by another smattering of profits warnings from the US, which forced Wall Street's leading indices lower. By the time London traders were heading home for the weekend, the Nasdaq was off around 4.34% and the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 2%. Back in London, the final scores showed the FTSE 100 up 12.5 points at 6,198.1, a somewhat misleading figure given that the blue chip index entered the closing auction process around 10 points lower. But, as is becoming all too common, it spiked higher after a couple of big trades were put through the market right on the close. Elsewhere, the Techmark 100 fell 11.24 points 2,448.63, unsettled by the performance of the Nasdaq. Telecoms stocks were having another good session with Deutsche Bank - probably the biggest force in the telecoms sector - encouraging clients to pile into the likes of Vodafone, 3.25p better at 242.25p, Colt Telecom, up 95p to \u00a316.20, Fibernet, 30p higher at 755p, and BT, 17p to stronger to 630p. But the award for best blue chip performer of the day went to software developer Autonomy, up 225p to \u00a315.35p, after it issued a positive trading statement. Over in the banking sector, there was renewed interest in Abbey National, 39p higher at \u00a312.74, following news that Lloyds TSB, up 1p to 751p, is seeking clearance from regulators for its proposed takeover. Dealers also heard a late rumour that HSBC, off 10p to \u00a310.26, might be poised to enter the fray with an offer for Abbey. On Thursday it was drug stocks and yesterday it was the turn of insurance stocks to be hit by profit taking. After a good run, investors decided that it was time to cash in some of last year's gains. CGNU fell by 65p to \u00a310.26, while Royal &amp; Sun Alliance dipped 27p to 520.5p. Lower down the corporate ladder, telecoms switch maker BATM picked up 11p to 116.5p, with dealers attributing the rise to the clearance of a large stock overhang of some 10m shares on Thursday. Enterprise Oil ended 2.25p higher at 570p after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein swiftly placed 8m shares at 553p. At the speculative end of the market, Psion, the handheld computer maker, fell 13.5p to 256.5p, hit by renewed speculation that a profits warning was on the way.",

His simultaneous use of line engraving and stippling methods on both sides of the glass was a great innovation, creating an illusion of perspective in his portrayal of unmistakeably English landscapes.</p> <p>Laurence had many followers, and in 1975 became the first president of the newly-established Guild of Glass Engravers. Exhibitions of his glass over the years included those at Agnews in 1969, the Coming Museum, New York, in 1974, Sotheby's in 1992 - to celebrate his 80th birthday - and one with his son, Simon, also a glass engraver, in Salisbury in 1994.</p> <p>His glasses were popular commemorative gifts and he received several important commissions from members of the royal family. He also engraved glass for several church windows, including his most important commission of 12 large windows at Moreton church, Dorset.</p> <p>Laurence was the youngest son of a builder and decorator, and his wife, who lived in Eltham, southeast London. He revered his older brother, the artist Rex Whistler. The family moved at various times, and he was finally sent to Stowe school, where his history tutor, Martin Mac- laughlin, encouraged him to make measured drawings of the school buildings. In 1930, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where his fees were paid by Rex, by then earning a good deal as an artist and illustrator.</p> <p>Laurence changed from studying history to English, leading a quiet life mostly reading poetry. His first book of poems, Armed October, was published in 1932, with illustrations by Rex. In 1934, he published a second book of poems and took a job as assistant secretary to the press board of the Church Assembly. In 1935, he won the Royal Gold Medal for Poetry, given for the best book of the year by a writer under 35.</p> <p>On the strength of this prize, Laurence left his job, and signed contracts for a further book of poems, and a life of the architect and dramatist Sir John Vanbrugh. Published in 1938, this last book was a pioneering work, which revived interest in the English baroque architecture movement.</p> <p>To supplement his income, Laurence began glass engraving. In 1934, he stayed with the daughter of Sir Edwin Lutyens in Northumberland, where, with a diamond-tipped pencil, he engraved a sonnet on a window pane, decorating it with an urn of wild flowers. Rex encouraged him and Laurence's first designs were in the manner of his brother.</p> <p>It was around this time that he met Jill Furse, a young actress. They married in 1939 and, when war was declared, settled at a cottage at Venton, near Bideford, where he continued glass engraving and, with Jill's encouragement, wrote poetry. Their idyllic life at this time is described in Laurence's book, The Initials In The Heart, which was published in 1964 to wide acclaim. During the war, he served as an army instructor.</p> <p>In 1944, he suffered two personal tragedies. In July, Rex was killed in action in Normandy - Laurence read the news when he picked up a newspaper at Waterloo station. Then, in November, not long after the birth of a daughter, Jill died of a blood infection. Laurence was unable to be with her at the time.</p> <p>After demobilisation, he went to live with his young children, and the Furse family, in London and, later, Devon. In 1950, he married Theresa, the younger sister of Jill, with whom he had a son and daughter. This marriage broke up. His third marriage, to Carol, in 1987 was dissolved in 1991.</p> <p>Other books included Rex Whistler, His Life And His Drawings (1948), The Laughter And The Urn, The Life Of Rex Whistler (1985), and several works on his engraved glass.

      "body": "<p>A leader in the Guardian a couple of weeks before Christmas commented on the changing age profile of the population in Britain and other developed countries. It said: \"We already live in the oldest society that has existed, but it is going to get older still. Fewer births and longer lives mean the number of people aged 65 and over will increase at 10 times the overall rate of population growth in the next 40 years.\" </p> <p>There is still perhaps more awareness of this in the US than in Britain. A cartoon in the New Yorker in the summer of last year had a woman addressing her husband with the words: \"Good news, honey - 70 is the new 50.\" An episode of Frasier, shown on television in Britain a month later, had Dr Frasier Crane remarking: \"You sound like my father - a man who believes that burial is a form of age discrimination.\" </p> <p>About one-quarter of the Guardian's readers are over the age of 55, more or less equivalent to the proportion on other broadsheets, except for the Daily Telegraph, which has nearly half its readers in that upper-age band. </p> <p>The Guardian, like all its rivals, makes great efforts to attract young people but still attempts, now and again, a conciliatory nod towards its older readers. Remarkably, in mid-December the paper started a monthly Grandparents page, the advent of which was marked by the editorial quoted above. The editor of the page, a man some long way from becoming a grandparent, pointed out in a persuasive introductory article that 40% of parents admit that their working lives would be impossible without the childcare provided by their own parents. It should be worth watching the page as it explores the implications of that and other aspects of a long life sanctioned by an assumed or assigned role. </p> <p>My correspondence leaves me in no doubt that many readers, particularly those who are themselves in the upper-age bracket, believe the paper is at best confused in its attitude to age, and at worst ageist.

      "bodyText": "A leader in the Guardian a couple of weeks before Christmas commented on the changing age profile of the population in Britain and other developed countries. It said: \"We already live in the oldest society that has existed, but it is going to get older still. Fewer births and longer lives mean the number of people aged 65 and over will increase at 10 times the overall rate of population growth in the next 40 years.\" There is still perhaps more awareness of this in the US than in Britain. A cartoon in the New Yorker in the summer of last year had a woman addressing her husband with the words: \"Good news, honey - 70 is the new 50.\" An episode of Frasier, shown on television in Britain a month later, had Dr Frasier Crane remarking: \"You sound like my father - a man who believes that burial is a form of age discrimination.\" About one-quarter of the Guardian's readers are over the age of 55, more or less equivalent to the proportion on other broadsheets, except for the Daily Telegraph, which has nearly half its readers in that upper-age band. The Guardian, like all its rivals, makes great efforts to attract young people but still attempts, now and again, a conciliatory nod towards its older readers. Remarkably, in mid-December the paper started a monthly Grandparents page, the advent of which was marked by the editorial quoted above. The editor of the page, a man some long way from becoming a grandparent, pointed out in a persuasive introductory article that 40% of parents admit that their working lives would be impossible without the childcare provided by their own parents. It should be worth watching the page as it explores the implications of that and other aspects of a long life sanctioned by an assumed or assigned role. My correspondence leaves me in no doubt that many readers, particularly those who are themselves in the upper-age bracket, believe the paper is at best confused in its attitude to age, and at worst ageist. To return to the editorial I was quoting, it continued thus: \"The US is already seeing a rising proportion of wrinklies in work.\" (Collins, \"wrinklies\": informal, derogatory [term for] old people.) Several readers combined a welcome for the Grandparents page with a note of dismay at the use of the word. \"I don't think the word 'wrinkly' is needed in the language, any more than derogatory nicknames for [other groups]. We need to respect all our fellow citizens, not demean them. Remember what Sophia Loren said about wrinkles: not to retouch photos showing hers because 'it took me so long to earn them'.\" Other correspondents made the same point. \"To be defined simply by one aspect of our being - one generally considered negative - is totally out of order and... abusively ageist...

A chorus of distinguished commentators, among them Thorstein Veblen, John Kenneth Galbraith, Vance Packard, Ralph Nader, and the philosophers of the Frankfurt School, all condemn the waste, folly, false consciousness and victimhood of consumerist society, which they describe as a conspiracy to force us to labour so that we can purchase the crumbs of pleasure that the system lets fall from the tables of those whose unnecessary products we buy. And in the meantime we are engulfed in waste and pollution as we sit in the blue flicker of television advertisements, eating our unhealthy microwaved TV dinners. </p> <p>But the evidence in support of this orthodoxy is equivocal. Quite different data suggest that consumers are smart, and that shopping is a profound source of meaning in the modern world. The orthodoxy seems to imply that if only advertisers would leave us alone, we would all begin reading Wittgenstein and listening to Mahler. But we would not. We want Things; we want Stuff; we want to buy and to own. And as the laws of supply and demand suggest, it is the consumers who lead, while the producers and advertisers scamper after them, supplying the consolations and salvations (religious language springs naturally to mind) that brand names and the joys of ownership provide. </p> <p>Perhaps, therefore, consumers' love of consuming is not so contemptible. There is a theory, amusingly and cogently offered by James Twitchell of Columbia University, that consuming is the passion and the creativity of contemporary life. Through the possession of Things, he says, we define ourselves, interpret our society, and give our lives coherence. We do not wish to drive a car, but a Ferrari; we do not wish to drink champagne, but Veuve Cliquot; we do not wish to wear a suit, but an Armani suit. Owning them gives us meaning. The language of products and services is the shared language of our community. Logos and advertisements are the cultural emblems of our time, signposts that help us navigate our world and evaluate what we meet in it. Both the language and the images offer what religion once did - a common structure. But as a community bond it is, says Twitchell, more democratic and equitable. For consumers are not fools, not victims of dogmas taught by a priesthood. They are their own priests; they know what they want, and they are getting it. </p> <p>Consider the logic of brand names. Why do people buy and wear expensive, recognisable brands? Because it gives them - it really does give them - a claim to social place, prestige, confidence, purpose. That is the key to consumerism: ownership of precisely these intangibles is what purchase of their tangible vehicles buys. </p> <p>The argument that consumption is not oppression - that consumers are happy, that consumption is satisfying and gives life meaning - is exhilaratingly robust. But it is hard to suppress the thought that, if happiness is what matters, you could achieve the same degree of it more swiftly and economically by putting heroin in the water supply.

      "body": "<p>I'm very pleased for the good people of Greenwich, knowing that they'll be going forward into the brave future without that rotten Dome hanging over them; I only wish that my own 'burg was about to rid itself of a flashy, trashy, empty monument to the vanity of politicians. But sadly, the one which I now live in the shadow of is going to last a bit longer than a year, and in fact the only chance of escaping it, ever, would be by moving away and staying away. I refer, of course, to last month's creation of Brighton &amp; Hove as one of the three millennial cities. </p> <p>A city! No matter how many times they say it, it'll never sound right. Can you walk across a city in half an hour? Is a city a short commuter hop from London, and does half its population need to go to London each morning in order to find gainful employment? Maybe. I don't know. But most of all, I've got real \"issues\", if you will, with the idea of a City By The Sea, as we're now supposed to think of ourselves. Yes, I know that they've got them in Europe. But they've got rabies and a history of Nazi collaboration in Europe, too. Does that mean it's mandatory for us as well? To citify a seaside town in this country is to totally disregard the special nature of the British coastal resort. From Bournemouth to Blackpool, coarse or genteel, they all have a certain something in common; their gentleness, their outdatedness, their very lack of everything - graft, overcrowding, pollution - that makes a city a city. </p> <p>And exactly what is so great about living in a city? Every last survey on this subject shows that while around three-quarters each of all town- and country-dwellers express satisfaction with their quality of life, this plummets to around 10% when you ask an urbanite. You don't even have to read about it; you can see them promenading along Brighton seafront every weekend, well into the autumn - thousands of Londoners set free for the day, blinking and smiling with surprise at all this light and space, poor little mole-people above ground at last. And even when the Palace Pier is jammed solid with humanity, there's never the nastiness you sense in similar city situations, simply because the ever-present sea and the incredible horizon reminds us what a big place the world is, and that we are not necessarily condemned to live and die in a rat-run.

      "bodyText": "I'm very pleased for the good people of Greenwich, knowing that they'll be going forward into the brave future without that rotten Dome hanging over them; I only wish that my own 'burg was about to rid itself of a flashy, trashy, empty monument to the vanity of politicians. But sadly, the one which I now live in the shadow of is going to last a bit longer than a year, and in fact the only chance of escaping it, ever, would be by moving away and staying away. I refer, of course, to last month's creation of Brighton &amp; Hove as one of the three millennial cities. A city! No matter how many times they say it, it'll never sound right. Can you walk across a city in half an hour? Is a city a short commuter hop from London, and does half its population need to go to London each morning in order to find gainful employment? Maybe. I don't know. But most of all, I've got real \"issues\", if you will, with the idea of a City By The Sea, as we're now supposed to think of ourselves. Yes, I know that they've got them in Europe. But they've got rabies and a history of Nazi collaboration in Europe, too. Does that mean it's mandatory for us as well? To citify a seaside town in this country is to totally disregard the special nature of the British coastal resort. From Bournemouth to Blackpool, coarse or genteel, they all have a certain something in common; their gentleness, their outdatedness, their very lack of everything - graft, overcrowding, pollution - that makes a city a city. And exactly what is so great about living in a city? Every last survey on this subject shows that while around three-quarters each of all town- and country-dwellers express satisfaction with their quality of life, this plummets to around 10% when you ask an urbanite. You don't even have to read about it; you can see them promenading along Brighton seafront every weekend, well into the autumn - thousands of Londoners set free for the day, blinking and smiling with surprise at all this light and space, poor little mole-people above ground at last. And even when the Palace Pier is jammed solid with humanity, there's never the nastiness you sense in similar city situations, simply because the ever-present sea and the incredible horizon reminds us what a big place the world is, and that we are not necessarily condemned to live and die in a rat-run. That's why, albeit shamefully, three out of four Brighton properties are sold to Londoners. And what have we done about what should be such a great source of local pride?

      "body": "<p>One of the enduring 20th-century images of mass folly is the shot - reproduced on many a jokey retro postcard - of 1950s cinema audiences, wearing cumbersome cardboard glasses as they gawp at some extravaganza in living, in-your-lap 3D: Bwana Devil! House of Wax! Cat Women of the Moon! </p> <p>Such crowd scenes look to us now like the epitome of passive hickdom. How sheep-like could people be? But that's just the snobbery of historical hindsight. In reality, for all the tawdriness of much of the 1950s 3D cycle, contemporary audiences were enjoying nothing more witless than a dabble in the pleasures of trompe l'oeil illusion. Trompe l'oeil , far from entailing a passive viewer, is an active, critical process - it requires viewers to measure their 2D expectations against the semblance of three dimensions. It's the film equivalent of puzzling over an Escher print. </p> <p>In fact, seen today, 1950s 3D doesn't look 3D at all -more like a set of 2D planes aligned in an imaginary 3D space, rather like a cardboard pop-up book. Take the forthcoming re-release of the 1953 movie Kiss Me Kate. Despite the Cole Porter songs, it's not a great musical - it is contrived and woodenly theatrical. But what's fascinating is that its theatricality goes together with a bizarre visual flatness. The film makes ample use of one of the great 3D cliches - with characters hurling gloves, dice, goblets directly at the camera - but it's the flatness, the cardboard cut-out aspect, that is really transfixing. </p> <p>The opening sequence in Howard Keel's apartment is a bizarre construction of diagonals and receding surfaces. There are mirrors everywhere, fragmenting the space into as many flat planes as possible. The scene looks unnerving, almost sinister, and every inch like a stage set. It seems like the locale not for a musical but for a murder mystery. Later, when the characters take to the stage in an impressionistic mock-up of Shakespearean Padua, the two-dimensionality is even more pronounced: the set looks like a Broadway version of De Chirico. </p> <p>Paradoxically, 3D cinema offers a rare chance to revel in the truly 2D. Films like Kiss Me Kate don't make things more lifelike; quite the contrary. We are in the habit of seeing people and objects on screen as if they were 3D anyway: we assume we are seeing flesh-and-blood actors rather than flat 2D shapes. Seeing a 1950s 3D film in all its awkward cut-out quality allows us to measure the difference between the cinematic illusion we habitually manufacture in our own minds and a different kind of illusion, with limitations that are all too obvious. </p> <p>But 3D technology has come a long way since then. With 3D productions for the vast Imax screen, we still wear the comical glasses, but the critical distance has diminished. One of the most dazzling, most sense-engulfing spectacles I have ever seen - bigger, brasher, more kitsch than Fantasia, Gladiator, Independence Day, you name it - is the 3D Imax digital animation Cyberworld. A flashy portmanteau of computer-generated clips, Cyberworld displays a level of digital polish that makes Toy Story look homespun. A vast, futuristic space called the Galleria Animatica is the setting for various delights and horrors - sci-fi seascapes, futuristic big top extravaganzas, la Cirque du Soleil, a hideously ornate fantasia featuring the Pet Shop Boys, and (pause for breath and a welcome bit of primary-colour 2D clunkiness) the episode of The Simpsons in which Homer crosses into a 3D universe (\"Man, this place looks expensive!\"). </p> <p>Where 1950s 3D pelted us with flying cups now and then, the 21st- century variant goes much further. If crockery flew in Cyberworld, it would come in all-enveloping cyclones of intricately-traced willow-pattern china. No space is left unfilled, no surface without a fastidiously mapped texture. </p> <p>It's not just in front of you but all around. Thanks to a huge screen that allows no peripheral vision outside itself, the aesthetic is one of total immersion, and the immersion is merciless, the bombardment non-stop. When you're not floating through galactic oceans, you have a million bubbles exploding in your face, a million clown-hatted bird-things with the face of Neil Tennant morphing in geometric formation. </p> <p>The effect is oppressive - this seems to be a form of cinema that makes it almost impossible to react critically. And it may be no accident that Cyberworld's artists favour images of monumental architecture, like the cathedral-like vastness of the Galleria Animatica itself. There is, perhaps, an inherently totalitarian aesthetic to this form of cinema - it involves not imaginative involvement but knee-jerk submission. Perhaps bombastically inclined dictatorships in the coming century need not waste their resources on rallies or cumbersome monuments - state-of-the-art Pet Shop Boys videos may prove a much smarter investment. </p> <p>\u0095 Kiss Me Kate is re-released on January 19. Cyberworld is screening at the BFI Imax, London SE1 (tel: 020-7902 1234).</p>",

      "body": "<p>He is wearing a pair of feathered wings, and nothing else. He grins cockily and knowingly, holding a couple of arrows in his hand - he's Cupid, after all. But there's nothing cute about Caravaggio's Victorious Cupid. Painted lifesize in a bright light that picks out his flesh harshly, he looks right at us while his penis and balls hang in full view at the centre of the picture. He's posed in what to educated contemporary viewers was a recognisable parody of Michelangelo's sculpted Victory. At his foot lie the discarded emblems of intellectual and public life - a globe, a book, armour - blown away by desire. </p> <p>In the 20th century, the creator of this unsettling image - a man of violence and mental instability who was born in about 1565 in Caravaggio, near Milan, and died in shame and ignominy, a known murderer, in 1610 - leapt from obscurity and critical contempt to become probably the most popular of all the great Italian artists of the Renaissance and the Baroque. He is the one we feel is most our own, one of us. The name itself has become sexy, talismanic, namechecked in trendy academic books, such as Quoting Caravaggio or Caravaggio's Secrets. To be different, Peter Robb avoided the familiar name in his recent fictionalised biography and called his hero M, from the painter's birth name, Michelangelo Merisi. </p> <p>Photographers imitate Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio's light and artists identify with his depravity. In the quiet, serious rooms of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin, where Caravaggio's Victorious Cupid (1602) hangs, visitors are visibly embarrassed by the boy's naked display. So it's a shame that the gallery has refused to lend it to the Royal Academy's forthcoming exhibition of Baroque art, The Genius of Rome. This Cupid is the supreme embodiment of what this painter signifies today: transgressive sex. There's no doubting what the painting is about, or what the relationship was between artist and model. </p> <p>Or is there? Scholars, sad to say, do doubt it. They doubt that Caravaggio was even homosexual, as is widely believed. Our only written source for this near-universal assumption, Helen Langdon points out in her spoilsport 1998 biography, is a note made by a 17th-century English visitor to Rome, Richard Symonds, after he saw the Cupid. He reported: \"Twas the body and face of his owne boy or servant that laid with him.\" Langdon and other art historians suggest this is just tourist tittle-tattle, an unreliable bit of hearsay. </p> <p>Our entire sense of Caravaggio as a modern artist is, according to historians, a fiction. We see what we want to see. It's not even true that Caravaggio was some kind of despised, marginal figure in his lifetime. On the contrary, he was the most famous artist in Rome, the founder of a new kind of sharply illuminated naturalism that influenced every one of Europe's great artists in the 17th century. Caravaggio inspired the early genre paintings of Velazquez in Spain, and the lighting effects of Dutch Golden Age painters. He was recognised as the genius of his age even when he had to flee Rome to escape a murder charge. It was after his death that the critical backlash began; his art was condemned as wild, uncontrolled, gauchely disobedient to the rules of classicism. By the 18th century his influence was downplayed and his low, realist painting was disparaged as an insignificant chapter in the history of art. </p> <p>Obviously, the Victorians were not the people to reclaim this degenerate artist. It was only with an exhibition of Baroque art in Florence in 1922 that he began to come out of the shadows. As late as the 1950s Ernst Gombrich's The Story of Art treated Caravaggio as a minor figure. </p> <p>The trouble with our excitement about Caravaggio is that seeing him as modern means ignoring what is so powerful in his art. Peter Robb's M tries to expose some kind of anti-Church radicalism in Caravaggio, but nothing could be further from the truth. You only have to visit some of the churches in Rome where his altarpieces hang to see what Caravaggio's naturalist art, with its use of street people as models, did. It was a weapon of the Counter-Reformation. Caravaggio found a new, more direct way of telling religious stories: he cast urchins and old men off the Roman streets as saints and angels, and he painted martyrdoms as if they were happening here and now. </p> <p>In the church of Santa Maria del Popolo the founder of the Catholic Church is being executed. St Peter - a man aged and gnarled by labour, taken from an inn in some back alley to have his painting done - has already been nailed to the cross. He looks in fury at the nail holding his left hand in place. But the three younger men in the picture are subjecting him to a final ignominy. They are raising him by the legs, to crucify him upside down. It's hard, ungrateful work. You almost feel sorry for them. These are not the grotesques who crucify Christ in a painting by Bosch. They're ordinary working stiffs, doing their job. </p> <p>This is who Caravaggio's painting is addressed to: the ordinary people of Rome. You too are part of the story, says Caravaggio - you too have moral choices to make. Will you do good or evil? </p> <p>Yet there are problems with the view of Caravaggio as an orthodox Catholic artist. If that was the case, why were so many of his religious paintings - about half - rejected by the people who commissioned them? Modern viewers may go too far in dwelling on the sensual, near-nude angel in the foreground of The Rest on the Flight into Egypt (c 1595) - but the angel's sexy presence is an incongruously prominent feature of the painting. And how do you account for all those boys brandishing fruit or wine in a way that seems also to be an offer of sex? </p> <p>You can't ignore this invitation in Boy with a Basket of Fruit (c1593-4), coming to the RA from Rome's Galleria Borghese. Soft and hedonistic, the boy's face looks at us lingeringly, provocatively, and there is no missing the message that he too is a fruit for us to pick. Art historians may argue that Baroque art was driven by patronage, and that Caravaggio's patrons were men of piety, powerful clerics - but it's hard to talk away the eroticism of a painting like this. </p> <p> Perhaps Caravaggio's patrons, like him, led double lives. And perhaps the originality of his art is to acknowledge that doubleness, and to unite the two lives - to find the sacred in the profane and the profane in the sacred. </p> <p>So was Caravaggio both things, the good Catholic and the sexual adventurer ? Or was he a psychopath, as he has been portrayed? </p> <p>We know very little about Caravaggio, but we do know he was very violent. He had duels and participated in street fights almost constantly; he was the kind of man who would run up behind someone who had annoyed him and hit him on the head with his sword. His friends were always restraining him from doing worse and it didn't surprise anyone in Rome when he finally killed a man and fled the city. </p> <p>Perhaps the insoluble contradictions of Caravaggio's art are not profound at all but the work of a heartless stylist, a monster able to make sex and religion equally seductive. Yet this cannot be so, because his paintings burn with emotion, with compassion. The street people who pose in his paintings live for ever, and he intended it that way. If he was quick to anger, his art is quick to love. </p> <p>Caravaggio's lifestyle may never theless be the key to his art, the fact that it does not just veer from the holy to the unholy but explores both with unparalleled intensity. Caravaggio seems to have been addicted to danger; a friend diagnosed this as an excess of courage. It was as if he sought out instability, crisis, moments of risk. This is exactly the quality that all his paintings share - risk. His paintings are alive today because each staged tableau has a sense that it is about to break apart at any second. The men playing disciples are about to start fighting; the boy with the fruit is about to call the painter an old lech and run off; the painter is about to leap on Cupid. These paintings push painting to an edge where it is becoming life, is ending as art. </p> <p>Caravaggio looks like our contemporary because his scenes are so mesmerically poised in time, dramatising moments of choice and decision in which we ourselves are implicated. Will you accept the boy's offer of fruit? Will you just stand there watching St Peter being crucified upside down, or will you do something about it? These scenes transfix us as they transfixed their original viewers. And we will always walk away from the Victorious Cupid embarrassed and confused, a little relieved to be back among the nativity scenes and landscapes by other Old Masters, which don't have us blushing and wondering where to put our eyes. </p> <p>\u0095 The Genius of Rome 1592-1623 is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), from January 20 until April 16.</p>",

(But I do have to say that if you have ever doubted that David and Ruth would end up keeping the farm, you might not want to give up the day job just yet.) </p> <p>Yes, Brookfield stays in their capable hands. What swayed Phil Archer's aching heart was not fiscal good sense, or the emotional pull of his other children wanting their share of the inheritance. Nope, it was seeing \"just how committed David is to Brookfield\". I think what he meant was that David couldn't walk away from the place even if he wanted to. David agreed. \"I love this place, I live and breathe this farm,\" he said, with a blood-vessel-bursting urgency to his voice. Well, you would too if you were speaking from beneath a big heifer (no, not Ruth) who was crushing your ribs. </p> <p>In the 50th anniversary episode of The Archers (Radio 4), the world's longest running radio drama, David was missing after a filthy row with Phil. That featured during the previous night's quite superbly miserable double-length episode. It featured family fall-outs to rival Walford's best. </p> <p>In a mad moment, David and Ruth threatened to move to France (perhaps not the most obvious relocation option for beef farmers just now), and Kate worried that her daughter Phoebe no longer knows who she is.

(But I do have to say that if you have ever doubted that David and Ruth would end up keeping the farm, you might not want to give up the day job just yet.) Yes, Brookfield stays in their capable hands. What swayed Phil Archer's aching heart was not fiscal good sense, or the emotional pull of his other children wanting their share of the inheritance. Nope, it was seeing \"just how committed David is to Brookfield\". I think what he meant was that David couldn't walk away from the place even if he wanted to. David agreed. \"I love this place, I live and breathe this farm,\" he said, with a blood-vessel-bursting urgency to his voice. Well, you would too if you were speaking from beneath a big heifer (no, not Ruth) who was crushing your ribs. In the 50th anniversary episode of The Archers (Radio 4), the world's longest running radio drama, David was missing after a filthy row with Phil. That featured during the previous night's quite superbly miserable double-length episode. It featured family fall-outs to rival Walford's best. In a mad moment, David and Ruth threatened to move to France (perhaps not the most obvious relocation option for beef farmers just now), and Kate worried that her daughter Phoebe no longer knows who she is. She showered her with \"African presents\", though not the really sizeable one she's carried from Cape Town: a lovechild she is having with a man called Lucas. \"Is he black?\" worried Brian, sounding a bit like David under the heifer. But Kate has far more important questions on her mind. \"And when did she become Pheebs?\" she wailed (quite rightly on grounds of taste, even if it's off the flipping-cheek scale of maternal behaviour after a year's absence) to Roy and Hayley. When David and Ruth's good news came (\"Aw Dee-vidd,\" cooed Ruth), even Elizabeth joined in, though through clenched teeth. \"The future,\" she hissed, maybe thinking about spending it with Nigel, the poshest and most asexual man in the world, who owns a horse called Kaiser and has a lovely turn of phrase.

      "body": "<p>The opening credits have not yet rolled on the four-part BBC drama Rebel Heart and already it has become embroiled in the requisite row over any dramatic portrayal of Irish history. </p> <p>What differentiates Rebel Heart from any previous television account of the Irish Troubles of 1916-22 is the fact that it gives prominence to the north of Ireland, and especially to the plight of the Catholic minority left stranded within the new, militantly Protestant statelet established by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Any treatment of the violent origins of Northern Ireland and, above all, any reminder of the murderous activities of the RUC and their paramilitary allies during those initial years is bound to rouse the ire of unionists, who are presently attempting to ensure that the Patten Report on the RUC is not implemented in full. For were it to be so implemented, then they might be faced with the appalling prospect of having the activities of the RUC over the past 30 years or so impartially investigated. </p> <p>Several attempts to investigate the RUC's activities since 1969-70 have been aborted; the removal of John Stalker just before the completion of his inquiry, begun in 1984, is the most blatant and notorious of the so far successful campaigns to keep the truth hidden. This is a police force that cannot bear investigation and believes it will always have the political support to keep that spectre at bay. </p> <p>The reports I have read about Rebel Heart are really about the RUC and Patten, and the unionist anxiety to disguise a long, criminal history of violence, systematic discrimination, and the abuse of law. In addition, they seem to claim (but it is hard to be sure about this, since the commentary is somewhat incoherent) that the writer Ronan Bennett should not have been commissioned to write this drama series since he is known to be a republican, known to dislike or distrust the RUC, and must therefore be understood to be biased. </p> <p>At this point, the old questions about artistic representation and political partisanship have to be raised. Are Sean O'Casey's \"Irish\" plays to be dismissed because of their anti-republican bias? Or his socialist plays to be dismissed because of their failure to acknowledge the violence of the Soviet system? If such questions can legitimately be asked, it is difficult to know how the answers to them would avoid promoting censorship. Perhaps the ideal writer should be someone who always believes there is much to be said on both sides, and that such \"balance\" is the mark of impartiality or of being free of ideology. </p> <p>Slavoj Zizek reminds us that a basic procedure of Bertolt Brecht in his \"learning plays\" of the early 30s was to have actors pronounce an \"impossible\" commentary on their own acts. So one actor announces: \"I am a capitalist whose aim is to exploit workers. Now I will try to convince one of my workers of the truth of the bourgeois ideology which legitimises the exploitation.\" And then he goes up to another actor and does just that. Perhaps that is what all writers should do. It would make writing impossible, but it would at least help hidden ideologies to overcome their shyness. </p> <p>Otherwise, the dispute would seem to be a battle of atrocities. If Bennett wants to shift by three years the date of the massacre of the McMahon family by the police for the sake of a dramatic effect, does that seriously misrepresent the RUC or the unionist position? That massacre stands for many; it is both specific and representative, in its actual and in its premonitory violence towards the Catholic minority.</p> <p> Nor can it be said to be an extreme or melodramatic instance of state terror in the land of the B-Specials (later the UDR, then the RIR); the Special Powers Act (envied by white South Africans for its comprehensive demolition of civil rights), which remained in force from 1923-73, and was then replaced by the Emergency Provisions Act; not to mention the alphabet soup of the Protestant paramilitary organisations with which the police so often colluded. </p> <p>Bennett's emphasis here is on the nature of the state against which the IRA launched its campaign, although there was no IRA when the present killings, initiated by the RUC, began in 1969 in the aftermath of the demand for civil rights. To distrust or dislike the RUC is a perfectly reasonable position, especially for a Catholic, nationalist or republican, in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph, in its leader article of December 1 2000, describes Bennett as \"a biased republican writer\", and unblushingly describes Paul Bew, Peter Hart and Liam Kennedy as \"non-unionist\" scholars. Perhaps David Trimble might hasten to assure us that Bew, his adviser and apologist, is indeed a unionist and is as biased in favour of that position as even the Telegraph might wish. And if Blair McMahon's Nights in Armour is, in the article's own words, \"a pro-RUC novel\", is it not right that it should not \"see the light of day\" at the BBC, since, after all, we are arguing here against biased narratives, aren't we? Of course, the truth is that the Telegraph, with a characteristic incoherence, is arguing against a republican representation of Irish history. </p> <p>I returned to Ireland just before Christmas, after four months away in the US. I had not seen or heard of Rebel Heart, nor of the Tory and unionist vapourings that attended the previews or the rumours about the previews. Before I left, I had read Ronan Bennett's novel The Catastrophist; and while away, I read a film script he had written of a novel of mine, Reading in the Dark. I had told Bennett in a phone conversation to feel free to do as he wished with the novel; I had (and have) no interest in working on or being consulted about a film or TV version. Apart from that, I have met Bennett maybe four or five times; and I have read much, but by no means all, of his work. </p> <p>I have to say straightaway that I don't think Rebel Heart shows him at anything like his best. This is a costume drama with guns. It has none of the directorial drive of Neil Jordan's Michael Collins; it simply enlists a series of incidents to represent a particular reading of the events of those years. Socialism disappears into nationalism; nationalism disappears into capitalism; the Republic disappears into the future, and the North becomes the \"carnival of reaction\" that James Connolly predicted. </p> <p>The cast seem to act under an invisible restraint. It is not so much the dialogue, although that can be pretty arthritic at times, as their physical presence that seems to be reluctant. The love scenes are rather painful to watch in this regard. Instead of a tentative delicacy, there is embarrassment. The stereotypes of class and of gender are so potent that there is no opportunity for nuanced development for any one of the individuals. </p> <p>Ultimately, apart from technical considerations which I am not qualified to analyse, it seems to me that the surprising stiffness of the whole series derives from the very absence of what Bennett has been accused of having in too great abundance. The series lacks political conviction of the most basic kind. As the Dublin middle-class nationalist-republican hero, Ernie Coyne, and his former working-class Citizen Army friend O'Toole die at one another's hands in the first battle of the civil war, the effect is not really quite so tragic or ironic as it would seem to offer itself as being. What both these men wanted, beyond love or friendship, was something to believe in, not just something to rebel against. As they agree, it can be said of them that they died for Ireland. But the Ireland they died for was never commensurate with their desire. Bennett or his director, John Strickland, or both of them, seem to transmit to the narrative and to the cast a scepticism about the political world that runs athwart the aim of the series. </p> <p>It is difficult to say why this should be so. I'll hazard a guess, but it can be no more than that. Almost all drama and much fiction about the Irish political situation, and especially about the northern situation, has structured itself around the narrative of a collision between the private and the public life that turns out to be catastrophic. Inevitably, whether it is the lovers or the political leaders who take our attention, the analysis almost always finishes by saying that some of the most intimate and treasurable features of human existence simply cannot be accommodated politically. This inevitably assigns politics to the bigots and fanatics, and the private world to the emotionally wounded or the sensitive. That is a long inheritance in Irish writing; it is part of a long inheritance in Irish politics. The division is in part produced by violence; violence will not be replaced by peace, it will be replaced by justice. It is the wish for that, but the belief that it is not to be had, that constitutes Ronan Bennett's bias and that troubles this series. </p> <p>\u0095 Seamus Deane is Keough Professor at the University of Notre Dame.

      "body": "<p>The British film industry is under attack again. Alexander Walker, film critic of the London Evening Standard, has identified 13 films, made with the assistance of national lottery funding, that have under-performed at the British box-office. British film-making, he argues, needs to become more commercial to ensure a return on the public money invested in individual projects. But is that the answer? </p> <p>In 2000 Britain's film-makers abruptly lost the goodwill and enthusiasm that had sustained them through the latter half of the 90s. Large sums of public money seemed to have been frittered away, Britain's film-making community became increasingly frightened and defensive, and, most crucially, the jump in British film production and cinema audiences coincided with depressing individual box-office figures and undeniable aesthetic debacles. </p> <p>The new British film industry has not always been mired in such self-doubt. The current mood dates roughly from the release of the embarrassing All Saints movie Honest in May of last year, which suffered the indignity of being yanked from cinemas three days into its run and was greeted with derision from all sides. Until then, following the unexpected international success of Four Weddings and a Funeral in the spring of 1994, a mood of flag-waving we-can-do-it-too infectiousness had taken Britain's film-makers by storm. British production starts jumped - the total of 128 for 1996 was the first time since 1972 that the figure had broken the century mark - and further successes such as Trainspotting and The Full Monty greased the wheels of the industry. Britain puffed up its chest, rolled up its sleeves, and fed reel after reel of celluloid through its camera magazines. Sadly, most of it has proved commercially or aesthetically worthless; quite a lot of it was both. </p> <p>Walker calls for the chill wind of market reality to blow through the industry, but would that really cure the patient? Of course not. The world's most successful film industry - in the US - exists on the basis of a self-sustaining audience, where box-office figures can routinely match production spend. The British film audience isn't big enough to allow a commercial operation to stand alone. </p> <p>The only way big-budget British films could recoup their investment would be to sell to international markets, especially the US, but that would not square with Walker's idea of British films for British audiences. When it comes to British cinema, the US is happiest with what Alan Parker memorably called \"Laura Ashley film-making\". </p> <p>Just as market forces offer no solution, so sheltering the talent-free behind a wall of public funding is equally dangerous. It is staggering that some of the films castigated by Walker ever got made, let alone made with public money. </p> <p>There is no denying that British cinema is at a crossroads. But it is a crossroads with no signposts. Having unlocked the funding bonanza, the public agencies are continuing to tinker with the methods by which money filters through. The recently established British Film Council is the latest attempt to professionalise the government's grant-giving. But no one appears confident about what to do with it. </p> <p>Subsidy contains inherent dangers. It is a truism that staying independent makes for greater creativity, as the committee-generated sludge of the past few years proves. One solution after another - distribution, script development, the cinemas themselves - has been proposed, fiddled with, and proved generally fruitless. </p> <p>Yet it also remains true that people want to see British films. Give audiences a chance to get behind something and they will. The one constant feature of British cinema in the 1990s was the emergence of an annual in-from-nowhere, entirely unforeseen hit. The Full Monty, Lock Stock, Trainspotting, East is East, Billy Elliot - all by relative tyros, and in retrospect completely unplannable. </p> <p>These are films whose popular success puts them beyond criticism. Less dramatic, but perhaps more significant, is the Scottish film Ratcatcher, part funded by the lottery, and named in Walker's rollcall of shame. Despite miserable box-office, Ratcatcher is an aesthetic and critical success, and something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for those who yearn for authentic British art cinema. The principle of cultural defence through subsidy is also well-established, especially in Europe, but in Britain the issue is more complex: language is not a barrier, so audiences and film-makers can slip backwards and forwards from Hollywood. </p> <p>Isn't high cultural aspiration what publicly funded British film-making should be about? Well, yes and no. If subsidised film-making - of which Ratcatcher is a lonely, if shining example - is designed to complement a commercial sector, then the agencies would appear to be going about their task in a reasonably astute manner. But the film to which Ratcatcher is most often compared - Terence Davies's Distant Voices, Still Lives - was an equally lonely example of subsidised film-making in the pre-lottery era, when different subsidies attempted to prop up an even sicklier industry. Little has changed: successful art movies operate independently of organised funding structures, and take little account of which body is dishing out the cash. </p> <p>No one sets out to make a useless movie and anticipating the whims of the audience is a thankless task. But anticipate them a producer must, and where should one look for inspiration? The best English-language movies are produced in the US independent sector, itself a much-disputed definition: films such as Rushmore, Happiness, Your Friends and Neighbors, Deconstructing Harry, Flirting with Disaster, The Ice Storm, American Psycho and The Big Lebowski. (Ironically, the last was produced by a British company, and the penultimate by a British director). These films - intelligent, adult and in English - are the targets and models of any self-respecting film-makers, whatever their commercial viability. </p> <p>Further evidence of our own film-making timidity are foreign films that really ought to be British. Take The Limey, directed by Steven Soderbergh - a complex, astute homage to British 60s cinema.

      "bodyText": "The British film industry is under attack again. Alexander Walker, film critic of the London Evening Standard, has identified 13 films, made with the assistance of national lottery funding, that have under-performed at the British box-office. British film-making, he argues, needs to become more commercial to ensure a return on the public money invested in individual projects. But is that the answer? In 2000 Britain's film-makers abruptly lost the goodwill and enthusiasm that had sustained them through the latter half of the 90s. Large sums of public money seemed to have been frittered away, Britain's film-making community became increasingly frightened and defensive, and, most crucially, the jump in British film production and cinema audiences coincided with depressing individual box-office figures and undeniable aesthetic debacles. The new British film industry has not always been mired in such self-doubt. The current mood dates roughly from the release of the embarrassing All Saints movie Honest in May of last year, which suffered the indignity of being yanked from cinemas three days into its run and was greeted with derision from all sides. Until then, following the unexpected international success of Four Weddings and a Funeral in the spring of 1994, a mood of flag-waving we-can-do-it-too infectiousness had taken Britain's film-makers by storm. British production starts jumped - the total of 128 for 1996 was the first time since 1972 that the figure had broken the century mark - and further successes such as Trainspotting and The Full Monty greased the wheels of the industry. Britain puffed up its chest, rolled up its sleeves, and fed reel after reel of celluloid through its camera magazines. Sadly, most of it has proved commercially or aesthetically worthless; quite a lot of it was both. Walker calls for the chill wind of market reality to blow through the industry, but would that really cure the patient? Of course not. The world's most successful film industry - in the US - exists on the basis of a self-sustaining audience, where box-office figures can routinely match production spend. The British film audience isn't big enough to allow a commercial operation to stand alone. The only way big-budget British films could recoup their investment would be to sell to international markets, especially the US, but that would not square with Walker's idea of British films for British audiences. When it comes to British cinema, the US is happiest with what Alan Parker memorably called \"Laura Ashley film-making\". Just as market forces offer no solution, so sheltering the talent-free behind a wall of public funding is equally dangerous. It is staggering that some of the films castigated by Walker ever got made, let alone made with public money. There is no denying that British cinema is at a crossroads. But it is a crossroads with no signposts. Having unlocked the funding bonanza, the public agencies are continuing to tinker with the methods by which money filters through. The recently established British Film Council is the latest attempt to professionalise the government's grant-giving. But no one appears confident about what to do with it. Subsidy contains inherent dangers. It is a truism that staying independent makes for greater creativity, as the committee-generated sludge of the past few years proves. One solution after another - distribution, script development, the cinemas themselves - has been proposed, fiddled with, and proved generally fruitless. Yet it also remains true that people want to see British films. Give audiences a chance to get behind something and they will. The one constant feature of British cinema in the 1990s was the emergence of an annual in-from-nowhere, entirely unforeseen hit. The Full Monty, Lock Stock, Trainspotting, East is East, Billy Elliot - all by relative tyros, and in retrospect completely unplannable. These are films whose popular success puts them beyond criticism. Less dramatic, but perhaps more significant, is the Scottish film Ratcatcher, part funded by the lottery, and named in Walker's rollcall of shame. Despite miserable box-office, Ratcatcher is an aesthetic and critical success, and something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for those who yearn for authentic British art cinema. The principle of cultural defence through subsidy is also well-established, especially in Europe, but in Britain the issue is more complex: language is not a barrier, so audiences and film-makers can slip backwards and forwards from Hollywood. Isn't high cultural aspiration what publicly funded British film-making should be about? Well, yes and no. If subsidised film-making - of which Ratcatcher is a lonely, if shining example - is designed to complement a commercial sector, then the agencies would appear to be going about their task in a reasonably astute manner. But the film to which Ratcatcher is most often compared - Terence Davies's Distant Voices, Still Lives - was an equally lonely example of subsidised film-making in the pre-lottery era, when different subsidies attempted to prop up an even sicklier industry. Little has changed: successful art movies operate independently of organised funding structures, and take little account of which body is dishing out the cash. No one sets out to make a useless movie and anticipating the whims of the audience is a thankless task. But anticipate them a producer must, and where should one look for inspiration? The best English-language movies are produced in the US independent sector, itself a much-disputed definition: films such as Rushmore, Happiness, Your Friends and Neighbors, Deconstructing Harry, Flirting with Disaster, The Ice Storm, American Psycho and The Big Lebowski. (Ironically, the last was produced by a British company, and the penultimate by a British director). These films - intelligent, adult and in English - are the targets and models of any self-respecting film-makers, whatever their commercial viability. Further evidence of our own film-making timidity are foreign films that really ought to be British. Take The Limey, directed by Steven Soderbergh - a complex, astute homage to British 60s cinema. Would it ever have got off the ground if a British director had had the idea? The American independent system can't be replicated in Britain - it depends on an unholy alliance with its corporate Hollywood enemy. In the end, film-making is about individuals. The best film-makers succeed because they have the drive and ambition to succeed. This applies most obviously to visionary directors - the Coens, Abbas Kiarostami, Ang Lee, Terence Davies - but to producers, too. There is a clutch of production talent in Britain, but much that is pedestrian. Sadly, at the moment funding bodies seem unable to sort out one from the other.

      "body": "<p>Shortly before Christmas, when I should have been buying presents for everyone else, I went into Church's in Knightsbridge and bought myself two very expensive pairs of shoes. Both pairs were plain and black, one lace-up and one slip-on, and they reeked of timeless English quality. They weren't even made in Italy, as most quality English footwear is nowadays. They were made in Northampton, where Church's has always made its shoes. The man in the shop was solicitous and deferential without being smarmy, as good shop assistants are supposed to be. He was also a first-class salesman. </p> <p>\"Would I like some shoe trees?\" he asked. Not particularly, I said. \"Oh, but sir, I would strongly advise it,\" he replied. \"These are very fine shoes, and the shoe trees would be an economy in the long run. They would help them keep their shape and make them much easier to clean. Which reminds me - we have some very good traditional wax polish, made especially for Church's shoes, and we have excellent brushes for putting it on and taking it off, which I would also strongly recommend. You might also care for a shoe horn, if you haven't got one. A shoe horn can be a great help.\" </p> <p>So I left the shop several hundred pounds the poorer, promising to bestow on my new shoes the loving care that they deserved. There was no doubt that I needed them. My one remaining pair of shoes had holes in the bottom that let the water in, and their toes were scuffed and curling upwards. They hadn't had a dab of polish in months. I was so disgusted by them, in fact, that I took them off in the shop, and asked the man to throw them away. I saw him cast them gracefully into a waste basket as I left in one of my new pairs. </p> <p>The contempt with which I have normally treated my shoes during the past 45 years has its origins at my public school. There was a boy there from a family of big landowners in the Borders who was perfectly nice but who came to represent for me everything in British society from which I wanted to escape. I wasn't a rebel, but I didn't feel comfortable in the company of English country toffs whose main obsessions were field sports and keeping Labour out of power. Perhaps I was an early Blairite. </p> <p>My school friend (for he was, nevertheless, my friend) was a stiflingly conventional example of this type. He was, like me, only 16 at the time, but he already had firm opinions on everything and saw no reason ever to re-examine them. The main political issue of the day was the 1956 Suez adventure, in which Britain connived dishonestly with France and Israel to invade Egypt and came a well-deserved cropper as a result. </p> <p>This didn't help our relationship. My friend was a fanatical supporter of the invasion (nothing was too bad for Johnny Gippo), while I, under my father's influence, was just as fanatically against it. Another thing that didn't help was his shoes. They were as clean and shiny as a sergeant-major's boots, while mine were as dirty as a tramp's. Then one day he said something that I have never forgotten. \"You know,\" he said, \"you can tell a gentleman by his shoes.\" </p> <p> That settled it. I did not wish to be identified as a \"gentleman\" - especially if a \"gentleman\" meant someone like him - so I decided then and there that I would henceforth treat my shoes with what the late George Brown would have called total \"ignoral\". And, until now, I have done just that. I have never had more than a couple of pairs of shoes at any given time, and I have worn them until they were falling to bits. Then I have bought new ones and repeated the performance. </p> <p>But I have started the new year in a very different spirit. Each night, as I go to bed, I put my beautifully crafted wooden shoe trees inside my shoes and place them carefully on a shelf. Then next morning I get out my brushes and my traditional wax polish and burnish them until they glow. My clothes are still a mess, but my shoes, I like to imagine, are the envy of the neighbourhood. </p> <p>Nobody regards me as a gentleman, I'm glad to say. (My school friend was clearly wrong about that: con men have shiny shoes, too.) But I like to feel that my shoes - as Peter Mandelson hoped the Millennium Dome would be - are a \"mirror for the nation\", reflecting \"a nation intensely proud of its past and its achievements, its ingenuity and creativity, its bravery and its sense of justice and fair play\". They are at least as successful in that respect as the Dome has been.</p>",

I was so disgusted by them, in fact, that I took them off in the shop, and asked the man to throw them away. I saw him cast them gracefully into a waste basket as I left in one of my new pairs. The contempt with which I have normally treated my shoes during the past 45 years has its origins at my public school. There was a boy there from a family of big landowners in the Borders who was perfectly nice but who came to represent for me everything in British society from which I wanted to escape. I wasn't a rebel, but I didn't feel comfortable in the company of English country toffs whose main obsessions were field sports and keeping Labour out of power. Perhaps I was an early Blairite. My school friend (for he was, nevertheless, my friend) was a stiflingly conventional example of this type. He was, like me, only 16 at the time, but he already had firm opinions on everything and saw no reason ever to re-examine them. The main political issue of the day was the 1956 Suez adventure, in which Britain connived dishonestly with France and Israel to invade Egypt and came a well-deserved cropper as a result. This didn't help our relationship. My friend was a fanatical supporter of the invasion (nothing was too bad for Johnny Gippo), while I, under my father's influence, was just as fanatically against it. Another thing that didn't help was his shoes. They were as clean and shiny as a sergeant-major's boots, while mine were as dirty as a tramp's. Then one day he said something that I have never forgotten. \"You know,\" he said, \"you can tell a gentleman by his shoes.\" That settled it. I did not wish to be identified as a \"gentleman\" - especially if a \"gentleman\" meant someone like him - so I decided then and there that I would henceforth treat my shoes with what the late George Brown would have called total \"ignoral\". And, until now, I have done just that. I have never had more than a couple of pairs of shoes at any given time, and I have worn them until they were falling to bits. Then I have bought new ones and repeated the performance. But I have started the new year in a very different spirit. Each night, as I go to bed, I put my beautifully crafted wooden shoe trees inside my shoes and place them carefully on a shelf. Then next morning I get out my brushes and my traditional wax polish and burnish them until they glow. My clothes are still a mess, but my shoes, I like to imagine, are the envy of the neighbourhood. Nobody regards me as a gentleman, I'm glad to say. (My school friend was clearly wrong about that: con men have shiny shoes, too.) But I like to feel that my shoes - as Peter Mandelson hoped the Millennium Dome would be - are a \"mirror for the nation\", reflecting \"a nation intensely proud of its past and its achievements, its ingenuity and creativity, its bravery and its sense of justice and fair play\". They are at least as successful in that respect as the Dome has been.",

      "body": "<b> A good scar</b> <br> <p> He was in so deep a coma that I didn't bother using local anaesthetic when I sutured the wound in his face. It was Sunday afternoon in the ICU, and I had been called in from home to close the man's lacerations. The night before, on a dark road, he had gone through the windshield. </p> <p>It was really a job for a plastic surgeon. The wound extended from the top of his scalp deep into the tissues around his eye, then down his cheek into his mouth. I knew why they had called me, the intern. The man was not expected to live. </p> <p>I did my best, matching up the creases of his skin, easing the bright half-moon of the needle in and out, daubing away the dark blood that rose in little balls from the needle-point, tying my knots like a fly fisherman. The thermostat in the room was turned up all the way, but he was cold - I could feel it through my gloves. After a while, his face began to lose distinction to me. The wound stood out, became an entity unto itself. The earlier intimacy I had felt - bending over him as he lay there, my breath all around him - began to recede into the task. </p> <p>It took hours, my back aching, my scrubs damp under my blue gown in the heat. The only sound was the regular hiss of the ventilator. The soft brown skin around his eye was like a child's; his eye looked straight up, the pupil never moving, even as I tented his eyelid, trying hard not to slip the point of the needle into the eye itself. When I had finished, my hands shaking, I stopped, straightened, stepped away from the bed. He lay muffled in blankets, and it was only then that I saw, in the hollow between his knees, a single eagle feather and a small plastic bag full of yellow pollen, left by his family to save him. </p> <p>The next morning I came back to check my work. His face looked whole; only the thin blue lines of nylon sutures betrayed the extent of his wound. It was only after at least a minute of admiring the job that I realised that the sound of the ventilator, my constant companion in the room the day before, was absent, and that the man was dead. </p> <p><b> Sunday morning</b><br> </p> <p> We had a few minutes of calm, waiting in our gowns and gloves, our heavy lead aprons, as the radio filled the trauma room. A pickup truck, high-speed rollover, two coming in. Teenagers. </p> <p>The black boy, who came in first, was dead. He lay unmoving, eyes half-open, with a clear plastic tube sticking out of his mouth, the paramedics still squeezing air into it through a blue rubber bag. </p> <p>\"He's in asystole,\" the paramedic said, meaning his heart was not beating. As I turned away, I noticed his hair, cascading to his shoulders, dark and shining, each strand braided and tied with red and green beads. It was the labour of hours. </p> <p>The white boy was still alive, and the room changed for me; the silence on the far side, by the still gurney, instantly faded. They wheeled him in, and it began: the IV needles into his arms, the sudden, astonishing red of the blood spilled from them on the floor, the monitor wires to his chest, voices rising, the room suddenly full of noise and speed. </p> <p>He was blue, barely breathing. I took the laryngoscope, put the blade into his mouth, and immediately felt how deeply unconscious he was, how soft and unresisting the muscles were. I lifted his tongue and jaw and saw, very clearly, his vocal cords, a neat triangle, like two white glittering sticks. It was easy to pass the tube past them into his lungs. The oxygen flowed, and his face turned slowly pink, alive again. He was big and strong, with earrings in each ear, the sides of his head shaved, his brush cut dyed blond, curly and full of clotted blood. </p> <p>It was only a few minutes later, after the X-rays and calls to the blood bank, that I felt the back of his head. It was soft, and warm, and when I withdrew my hand it was covered with blood and grey tissue. The back of his head had been crushed. By that time I knew his name - John. </p> <p>The clerk tapped me on the shoulder. \"John's family is in the consultation room,\" she said. \"Will you go talk to them?\" </p> <p>I knocked on the door, stepped inside. All eyes turned. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, stiff, uneasy. \"John is critically injured. The neuro-surgeon is seeing him now.\" </p> <p>\"How bad is it?\" the mother asked, half rising from her chair. </p> <p>\"It's bad,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. I think you should be prepared for the worst.\" </p> <p>She sat back down. \"This isn't happening,\" she said to herself, softly. \"This can't be happening.\" </p> <p>\"Is Keith dead?\" the father asked. \"We heard that Keith might be dead. Is that true?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"Keith is dead.\" </p> <p>The room erupted - life in the presence of great damage, the overweight, middle-aged mother standing to weep in her husband's arms, the husband looking into the distance over my shoulder, at the white hospital wall. In the corners, a younger brother and sister, still children, began to cry. </p> <p>\"I'm very sorry,\" I said, knowing that anything I might say to them now would be simply sounds from a great distance. </p> <p>\"He was staying with us,\" the father said. \"He was John's best friend. They were driving back from the lake. They must have fallen asleep.\" </p> <p>Then, later, \"His family is in Colorado.\" </p> <p>I nodded. John's father looked up at me. \"Can I see Keith?\" he asked. </p> <p>He was perhaps 40, white, with long hair, tattoos on his arms, wearing a muscle shirt. As I led him back to the trauma room where Keith's body lay, I saw that goosebumps had risen on his arms and legs and he was shaking. </p> <p>The room was clean, all of the earlier frenzy gone, blood mopped up, everything back in place. The nurses had covered Keith's body with clean sheets so that only his face was visible, the clear plastic tube still sticking out of his mouth, and the amazing luxuriance of his hair. He looked almost unharmed. I stood in the doorway and let the man approach on his own. </p> <p>He walked up to the body and stood for long seconds. \"This is him,\" he said. \"This is really him.\" </p> <p>He fumbled under the sheet for the boy's hand. Then he bent down, his long, brown hair falling into the boy's face, and kissed him on the forehead. </p> <p>It suddenly seemed very important that I look closely, as closely as I could, at this man taking on for the moment the role of the father to the dead son, kissing him softly, holding his hand, then turning back to me and the doorway. </p> <p><b> Needle</b><br> </p> <p> I was walking past X-ray on my way back to the emergency room. The door to one of the X-ray suites was open, and, glancing inside, I saw a surgery resident I knew peering anxiously at a patient's monitor. Even from the door I could see what it said: blood pressure 60/40. Heart rate 130. </p> <p>\"What's up?\" I asked. The surgery resident turned. </p> <p>\"He's an MVA from the trauma room. We had to intubate him because he was so combative, but the CAT scans of his head and belly were normal. He's only got leg fractures - but his pressure just dropped.\" </p> <p>The patient was a young man, heavily sedated, on the ventilator. He was very pale. There were three of us in the X-ray suite - the nurse, the surgery resident and me - and in the half-dark of the room we looked at each other. Something was happening. Stepping up to him, I put my stethoscope against his chest. Each mechanical breath filled his right lung, with a faint whooshing sound, like feathers brushed across a rough surface. His left lung, though, was nearly silent. As I listened, the surgery resident opened the IV fluids wide, squeezing the bags in his hands to increase the flow. </p> <p>\"Let's get a chest X-ray,\" I said. \"He's already on the table, and his pressure just came up a bit.\" </p> <p>We spent a few anxious moments, watching his blood pressure, waiting for the film to be developed. The X-ray was still warm when we held it up to the light, and there it was: the left lung punctured, crumpled like a wet handkerchief, leaking air into the chest cavity, compressing the heart and the good lung. It was a classic, the kind that killed you in minutes: a tension pneumothorax. </p> <p>I found myself sprinting down the hallway to the ER for a needle and syringe, fumbling in a drawer, turning, rushing back as patients and nurses stared at me. I felt like an actor in a melodrama, cutting around people with a needle in my hand, my white coat trailing behind me like a cape. </p> <p>The man was ashen when I got to him, and I simply stuck the needle straight into his chest. Air hissed out of him like a bicycle tyre, in little bubbles of bloody froth. I took the 60cc syringe, attached it to the needle that was quivering between his ribs, and sucked. Then I detached the syringe, pushed the air out of it, and did it again - once, twice, four times, until the pull met resistance and the air was gone, the lung plump and full once more. </p> <p>It was as dramatic an act as any I was likely to accomplish again, blood pressure rising to normal, heart rate falling to normal, all of us breathing hard. Almost as an afterthought, I realised that I had saved him, that he was alive because of me. </p> <p>Late that night, after my shift, I went to see him in the ICU. He was already off the ventilator and breathing on his own, waking up, coming back, making dim animal noises through a haze of morphine and Valium. I knew that he would leave whole, and I sat there in the dark for a while, watching the red and blue lights of the monitor, savouring him, taking something for myself. </p> <p><b> A difference of opinion</b><br> </p> <p> \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending said every morning when we reached room six. We expected the remark. The intern would begin the presentation, and it was always the same. </p> <p>\"This is ICU day 28 for Mr Johnson, a 26-year-old cowboy with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure and anaemia ...\" A detailed analysis of each problem, in descending order of severity, then ensued. He was growing steadily worse. The ventilator had been at maximum settings for weeks, supplying the man's ruined lungs with just enough oxygen to ensure another identical presentation the next morning. </p> <p>\"This is ICU day 29 for Mr Johnson ...\" </p> <p>\"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending would say, and we would move on, halfway through rounds and already worn out. </p> <p>Mr Johnson was a bullrider, thrown at a local rodeo, who had broken several ribs. He'd gotten up, dusted himself off, gone home, and over a few days he had developed pneumonia in his injured lung. His family brought him in nearly unconscious, with both lungs full of pus, and over the ensuing weeks his other organs also failed: liver, kidneys, intestines. Mr Johnson lay drowning in his own fluid, the fever unrelenting, his family gathering and staring at him. Over the past few days they had stopped coming, consigning him, it seemed, to his fate alone. </p> <p>One night, more than a month into his stay, I was on call when his blood pressure began dropping yet again. The intern and I stood looking at him, swollen like a toad on the ventilator. He always tormented us like this. </p> <p>\"Give him some more fluids,\" I said. \"And let's go up on his dopamine.\" The nurse sighed; she'd heard all this before. </p> <p>Listening to the ragged sounds of his lungs, I thought something had changed. His left lung sounded a bit quieter than it had the night before, an ominous sign. </p> <p>\"All right,\" I said, resigned. \"Let's get a chest X-ray.\" </p> <p>The chest X-ray had not changed much. Looking hard, though, the radiology resident thought he saw a slight difference on the left. \"Could be a pneumo,\" he said, \"though I'm not sure. Let's get a CAT scan.\" </p> <p>He referred to the possibility that air was leaking out of a hole in the lung, collapsing it. The treatment for this is minor surgery, done at the bedside. You cut into the chest between two ribs, insert a finger into the chest cavity, and push the lung out of the way. Then you slide a long plastic tube between the lung and the chest wall. </p> <p>When suction is applied through the tube, air and blood rush out, allowing the lung to re-expand. Mr Johnson had been the victim of this procedure so often that his chest was a mass of wounds that refused to heal and oozed blood-tinged fluid into the bedding. </p> <p>The intern and I looked at each other, shaking our heads. This meant hours of work, wheeling him with his ventilator and multiple IV drips down to the CAT scanner, waiting for the scan to be read, then putting in the chest tube and getting X-rays to make sure we'd done it right. Any chance of sleeping that night vanished. It was already early morning, and we were tired. \"Looks like a pneumo, all right,\" the radiologist said, pointing to the dark mass of air visible on the CAT scan. \"A pretty big one. I'm surprised we didn't see it better on the X-ray.\" </p> <p>Mr Johnson's lung, by the time I finally cut down to it through the deep, soggy tissues of his chest wall, felt exactly like a piece of cork. It was stiff, as if already embalmed. \"You've got to check this out,\" I said to the intern. \"Put on some gloves and feel this thing.\" </p> <p>For a few moments he felt around with his finger, then withdrew it, covered with blood, and held it instinctively up in the air. \"Feels like a piece of meat,\" he said. </p> <p>The next morning we were reprimanded. \"I think we should seriously consider the ethics of performing such aggressive procedures in this man,\" the attending began. \"I should have been called. It's high time, in fact, that we considered withdrawing support altogether.\" </p> <p>There was a long silence. \"He's a young guy,\" I protested. \"And we've done it before. And it helped.\" This was only marginally true. His blood pressure had come up slightly, but it was hard to know why. </p> <p>About this time, another attending came on the service, and for the next few weeks he alternated call nights with his colleague. He had different views. \"This is a young man,\" he would say when we reached room 6. \"This is exactly the kind of patient we should be most aggressive with.\" </p> <p>A bizarre dynamic developed. On even days we did almost nothing, checked no lab work, stopped antibiotics and tube feeds, and nodded solemnly as the attending shook his head and said things like, \"The most important thing we can do now is keep this man comfortable.\" </p> <p>On odd days it was the full-court press. We worked to undo the previous inactivity, checking arterial blood gases, blood cultures and X-rays, adding antibiotics and fluids, tinkering with the ventilator. </p> <p>We nodded solemnly as the attending said things like, \"This man deserves everything we can give him.\" </p> <p>This went on for more than a week, until my tenure in the ICU came to an end and I rotated back to the emergency room, leaving my nightly struggles with Mr Johnson behind. I was glad; he had unfailingly robbed me of sleep, and I had come to dread him. I knew him intimately, had examined him dozens of times, turned him over to look at his back, put my gloved finger in his mouth, in his rectum, into the interior of his chest cavity, and I had never once exchanged a single word with him. </p> <p>He was gone from the waking world, as nearly dead as a human being can be, lying at the edge but never quite crossing over, his body, his animal self just strong, or not strong, enough. I had hoped many times that he would die. </p> <p>About six months later, I was walking down the long hall back to the ER from the cafeteria. It was mid-afternoon, a slow day. The door to the pulmonary clinic was open as I passed. A few patients sat in plastic chairs, waiting for their appointments. In one corner, leaning casually against the wall, a man stood reading a newspaper. The paper obscured his face, but as he turned the page I saw it, and I stopped immediately. I felt a strong and sudden force. It took me a few seconds: I knew the man, I knew his face was signicant, but I didn't know why. Then I realised, disbelieving. </p> <p>\"Mr Johnson?\" I asked tentatively, stepping in through the clinic door. </p> <p>He looked up at me from his newspaper. </p> <p>\"Are you Mr Johnson?\" I asked, beginning to feel foolish. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Do I know you?\" </p> <p><b> The secret</b><br> </p> <p> \"You have to come and see this,\" the nurse said breathlessly, interrupting rounds. \"It's the grossest thing I ever saw.\" </p> <p>It was early on Sunday morning, and the trauma team had been shuffling around the surgical ICU for an hour, trying to impose some order on the carnage of the night before. It was a blur for me by then, a stream of wounds and bodies. There had been only two surgery residents and me, and we had been going for 24 hours straight, trying not to miss something big. I felt jumpy, distant from the world, and the bright, white coats and accusing fingers of the surgery attendings seemed like the fixtures of dreams. </p> <p>I heard myself answering questions, searching my note-cards, I felt numbers emerging from my mouth, but I wasn't really there. I could smell the odour of my body rising from my scrubs, and my feet felt loose and wet in my running shoes. But she got my attention, anyway. She got everybody's. The grossest thing she ever saw ... </p> <p>Her patient lay in his darkened room, heavily sedated on the ventilator. After two weeks, he was getting better, and for the past few days we had all virtually ignored him. A young man, drunk, in his car, the same story again, coming slowly back into the world. </p> <p>\"Watch,\" the nurse said, lifting the ashlight from the bedclothes. We gathered around the bed. With her left hand she moved the clear plastic ventilator tube to the side of the man's mouth, then carefully inserted her fingers between his front teeth and spread them apart. His jaw opened slackly, and she shone the light directly into his mouth. </p> <p>His mouth was like a little pink cave. Inside were dozens of tiny white worms. As we watched, they began to move, to retreat into the darker recesses, away from the light, and in a few seconds they were gone. </p> <p>\"Oh my God,\" one of the residents said. \"They're maggots. He's got maggots in his mouth.\" The room erupted. We were horried, but also excited, exhaustion washed away. He was alive, and we made her do it again. </p> <p>We took turns, switching off the light for a minute or two until the maggots came back, then illuminating them, transxed by their retreat into the dark. </p> <p>\"What we need to do,\" Dr Whistler said, chortling, \"is get a piece of bacon on a string and leave it in his mouth for a while. I've seen this before. This is why we don't like flies in the ICU.\" </p> <p>One of the medical students went down to the cafeteria for the bacon, and before long the news had spread throughout the hospital. Nurses and medical students and residents from other services began filing through his room until finally the charge nurse put a stop to it. \"This isn't a sideshow,\" she said, to settle the matter. </p> <p>Tied to a string, raw and shiny with fat, the bacon worked beautifully. The nurse pulled it out every half hour or so, and each time it was alive with maggots. She wiped them off, dropped them into a bottle of alcohol, then replaced the bacon. \"It's like fishing,\" she said, chuckling, shaking her head. </p> <p>A month or so later, in the trauma clinic, I saw him again, stiff, thin, walking slowly with his cane. The nurse called his name, and he came slowly forward to the desk. </p> <p>We sat a few feet away, and as he stood writing his name on the forms, weak and alive, we whispered: \"That's the maggot man. Remember him? He's right over there.\" </p> <p>No one had told him a thing. </p> <p><b> Sugar</b><br> </p> <p> The little girl was running around the room, screeching happily, and when she saw me she hid under the bed. I could see her peering at me from between the legs of the gurney as I stood with her chart in my hand. Her father shook his head, grinned, and looked at his wife. \"I told you there's nothing wrong with her.\" </p> <p>I looked down at the chart. On it the triage nurse had written, in bold black letters, \"Two-year-old acting weird.\" </p> <p>\"I'm Dr Huyler. What can I do for you?\" </p> <p>\"Nothing,\" he said, and his wife hushed him. </p> <p>\"She's not acting right,\" she said. She wore an African print dress, and I found myself staring at the intricate pattern of swirling reds and browns. Her hair was cornrowed, a bead at the end of each strand. </p> <p>\"They're Medicaid,\" the triage nurse had whispered pointedly in my ear. The implication was clear: they wanted something for free. Tylenol, a work excuse. But it was 10 o'clock on a Friday night. </p> <p>\"What has she been doing?\" </p> <p>\"It's kind of hard to explain. She just isn't acting herself. I noticed it right away. But she's been fine ever since we got here.\" </p> <p>\"Can you be more specic?\" I could feel myself getting impatient. There were half a dozen patients waiting, the ER was full. I wondered why they hadn't called their regular paediatrician. </p> <p>\"Well,\" she said, thinking, \"you know how people look when they're staring into a mirror? Kind of blank?\" I nodded. \"She's like that. Only there isn't a mirror. There's nothing there.\" </p> <p>The child's vital signs were completely normal. Her mother coaxed her out from under the bed and held her wriggling in her arms as I listened to her heart and lungs, looked into her ears. I'm uneasy with children. I must have been a cold, white form to her, large, bending down with my stethoscope and light. I could see nothing wrong with her. She looked impeccably cared for, without any sign of the abuse I had been vaguely and secretly considering. I always do. It's been drummed into us. </p> <p>\"Does she have any medical problems at all?\" </p> <p>\"No,\" her father said, anticipating my questions. \"She's always been healthy. She's had all her shots. She's growing like she should, and she can talk a little, only now she won't 'cause she's shy.\" He wagged a finger, and she giggled, hiding her face with the bottle her mother had given her. </p> <p>\"Has she had any recent stress, something that might have upset her?\" </p> <p>They looked at each other. \"I don't think so.\" </p> <p>\"Is there a history of seizures in the family?\" </p> <p>Her mother thought for a while. \"I think my brother might have seizures,\" she said finally, \"but I haven't seen him in a long time.\" </p> <p>\"And right now she's acting normally?\" </p> <p>\"She's fine,\" her father said to his wife. \"Come on, let's go. If she does it again we'll come back. It's past her bedtime.\" </p> <p>I considered what I'd heard. A vague history of blank spells; it could mean anything, from a rare type of seizure to the vagaries of the two-year-old mind. She could see her paediatrician on Monday, I thought. She was a completely normal child. On my way out the door, though, I turned around. \"Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medications? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?\" </p> <p>\"Well, she stays with my mother when we're at work. She takes medicines.\" </p> <p>\"What kind of medicine does she take?\" </p> <p>\"I'm not sure. Something for her blood pressure and a sugar pill.\" </p> <p>Oral hypoglycemics - sugar pills - are among the most dangerous of overdoses. They can drop blood sugar profoundly, cause brain damage, seizures, coma. Designed for adult diabetics, they are long-lasting, and one pill could kill a small child, even many hours later. </p> <p>\"Let's check her blood sugar,\" I said, \"just to be sure. And please call your mother, find out exactly what she takes.\" </p> <p>From the doctor's station I could hear the child shrieking as the nurse drew her blood. Her mother spoke into the phone a few feet away. \"My mother takes glipizide,\" she said, handing me a piece of paper where she'd written it down. \"She ran out of her blood pressure medicine two weeks ago.\" </p> <p>A sugar pill. </p> <p>The nurse came out of the room with a syringe full of blood. The child's mother and I watched as she eased a single drop from the tip of the needle onto the portable blood-sugar machine she held in her hand. It digested the blood for a few seconds, then displayed the number on the screen. Forty-two. </p> <p>\"Is that low?\" her mother asked. </p> <p>\"It's about half of what it should be,\" I replied, stunned. \"She must have taken one of your mother's sugar pills.\" </p> <p>\"My mother is legally blind. She probably dropped one and didn't notice.\" </p> <p>\"We need to keep her in the hospital for at least a day and give her sugar intravenously.\" I said it quietly, half to myself. </p> <p>\"Will she be all right?\" She was afraid, staring at me. </p> <p>\"She'll be fine.\" And suddenly I began to shake. \"But I'm very glad you brought her in. You may have saved her life.\" </p> <p>\"My husband wanted to put her to bed,\" she said softly, looking off down the hall. </p> <p>It was suddenly clear.

      "bodyText": "A good scar He was in so deep a coma that I didn't bother using local anaesthetic when I sutured the wound in his face. It was Sunday afternoon in the ICU, and I had been called in from home to close the man's lacerations. The night before, on a dark road, he had gone through the windshield. It was really a job for a plastic surgeon. The wound extended from the top of his scalp deep into the tissues around his eye, then down his cheek into his mouth. I knew why they had called me, the intern. The man was not expected to live. I did my best, matching up the creases of his skin, easing the bright half-moon of the needle in and out, daubing away the dark blood that rose in little balls from the needle-point, tying my knots like a fly fisherman. The thermostat in the room was turned up all the way, but he was cold - I could feel it through my gloves. After a while, his face began to lose distinction to me. The wound stood out, became an entity unto itself. The earlier intimacy I had felt - bending over him as he lay there, my breath all around him - began to recede into the task. It took hours, my back aching, my scrubs damp under my blue gown in the heat. The only sound was the regular hiss of the ventilator. The soft brown skin around his eye was like a child's; his eye looked straight up, the pupil never moving, even as I tented his eyelid, trying hard not to slip the point of the needle into the eye itself. When I had finished, my hands shaking, I stopped, straightened, stepped away from the bed. He lay muffled in blankets, and it was only then that I saw, in the hollow between his knees, a single eagle feather and a small plastic bag full of yellow pollen, left by his family to save him. The next morning I came back to check my work. His face looked whole; only the thin blue lines of nylon sutures betrayed the extent of his wound. It was only after at least a minute of admiring the job that I realised that the sound of the ventilator, my constant companion in the room the day before, was absent, and that the man was dead. Sunday morning We had a few minutes of calm, waiting in our gowns and gloves, our heavy lead aprons, as the radio filled the trauma room. A pickup truck, high-speed rollover, two coming in. Teenagers. The black boy, who came in first, was dead. He lay unmoving, eyes half-open, with a clear plastic tube sticking out of his mouth, the paramedics still squeezing air into it through a blue rubber bag. \"He's in asystole,\" the paramedic said, meaning his heart was not beating. As I turned away, I noticed his hair, cascading to his shoulders, dark and shining, each strand braided and tied with red and green beads. It was the labour of hours. The white boy was still alive, and the room changed for me; the silence on the far side, by the still gurney, instantly faded. They wheeled him in, and it began: the IV needles into his arms, the sudden, astonishing red of the blood spilled from them on the floor, the monitor wires to his chest, voices rising, the room suddenly full of noise and speed. He was blue, barely breathing. I took the laryngoscope, put the blade into his mouth, and immediately felt how deeply unconscious he was, how soft and unresisting the muscles were. I lifted his tongue and jaw and saw, very clearly, his vocal cords, a neat triangle, like two white glittering sticks. It was easy to pass the tube past them into his lungs. The oxygen flowed, and his face turned slowly pink, alive again. He was big and strong, with earrings in each ear, the sides of his head shaved, his brush cut dyed blond, curly and full of clotted blood. It was only a few minutes later, after the X-rays and calls to the blood bank, that I felt the back of his head. It was soft, and warm, and when I withdrew my hand it was covered with blood and grey tissue. The back of his head had been crushed. By that time I knew his name - John. The clerk tapped me on the shoulder. \"John's family is in the consultation room,\" she said. \"Will you go talk to them?\" I knocked on the door, stepped inside. All eyes turned. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, stiff, uneasy. \"John is critically injured. The neuro-surgeon is seeing him now.\" \"How bad is it?\" the mother asked, half rising from her chair. \"It's bad,\" I said. \"I'm sorry. I think you should be prepared for the worst.\" She sat back down. \"This isn't happening,\" she said to herself, softly. \"This can't be happening.\" \"Is Keith dead?\" the father asked. \"We heard that Keith might be dead. Is that true?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Keith is dead.\" The room erupted - life in the presence of great damage, the overweight, middle-aged mother standing to weep in her husband's arms, the husband looking into the distance over my shoulder, at the white hospital wall. In the corners, a younger brother and sister, still children, began to cry. \"I'm very sorry,\" I said, knowing that anything I might say to them now would be simply sounds from a great distance. \"He was staying with us,\" the father said. \"He was John's best friend. They were driving back from the lake. They must have fallen asleep.\" Then, later, \"His family is in Colorado.\" I nodded. John's father looked up at me. \"Can I see Keith?\" he asked. He was perhaps 40, white, with long hair, tattoos on his arms, wearing a muscle shirt. As I led him back to the trauma room where Keith's body lay, I saw that goosebumps had risen on his arms and legs and he was shaking. The room was clean, all of the earlier frenzy gone, blood mopped up, everything back in place. The nurses had covered Keith's body with clean sheets so that only his face was visible, the clear plastic tube still sticking out of his mouth, and the amazing luxuriance of his hair. He looked almost unharmed. I stood in the doorway and let the man approach on his own. He walked up to the body and stood for long seconds. \"This is him,\" he said. \"This is really him.\" He fumbled under the sheet for the boy's hand. Then he bent down, his long, brown hair falling into the boy's face, and kissed him on the forehead. It suddenly seemed very important that I look closely, as closely as I could, at this man taking on for the moment the role of the father to the dead son, kissing him softly, holding his hand, then turning back to me and the doorway. Needle I was walking past X-ray on my way back to the emergency room. The door to one of the X-ray suites was open, and, glancing inside, I saw a surgery resident I knew peering anxiously at a patient's monitor. Even from the door I could see what it said: blood pressure 60/40. Heart rate 130. \"What's up?\" I asked. The surgery resident turned. \"He's an MVA from the trauma room. We had to intubate him because he was so combative, but the CAT scans of his head and belly were normal. He's only got leg fractures - but his pressure just dropped.\" The patient was a young man, heavily sedated, on the ventilator. He was very pale. There were three of us in the X-ray suite - the nurse, the surgery resident and me - and in the half-dark of the room we looked at each other. Something was happening. Stepping up to him, I put my stethoscope against his chest. Each mechanical breath filled his right lung, with a faint whooshing sound, like feathers brushed across a rough surface. His left lung, though, was nearly silent. As I listened, the surgery resident opened the IV fluids wide, squeezing the bags in his hands to increase the flow. \"Let's get a chest X-ray,\" I said. \"He's already on the table, and his pressure just came up a bit.\" We spent a few anxious moments, watching his blood pressure, waiting for the film to be developed. The X-ray was still warm when we held it up to the light, and there it was: the left lung punctured, crumpled like a wet handkerchief, leaking air into the chest cavity, compressing the heart and the good lung. It was a classic, the kind that killed you in minutes: a tension pneumothorax. I found myself sprinting down the hallway to the ER for a needle and syringe, fumbling in a drawer, turning, rushing back as patients and nurses stared at me. I felt like an actor in a melodrama, cutting around people with a needle in my hand, my white coat trailing behind me like a cape. The man was ashen when I got to him, and I simply stuck the needle straight into his chest. Air hissed out of him like a bicycle tyre, in little bubbles of bloody froth. I took the 60cc syringe, attached it to the needle that was quivering between his ribs, and sucked. Then I detached the syringe, pushed the air out of it, and did it again - once, twice, four times, until the pull met resistance and the air was gone, the lung plump and full once more. It was as dramatic an act as any I was likely to accomplish again, blood pressure rising to normal, heart rate falling to normal, all of us breathing hard. Almost as an afterthought, I realised that I had saved him, that he was alive because of me. Late that night, after my shift, I went to see him in the ICU. He was already off the ventilator and breathing on his own, waking up, coming back, making dim animal noises through a haze of morphine and Valium. I knew that he would leave whole, and I sat there in the dark for a while, watching the red and blue lights of the monitor, savouring him, taking something for myself. A difference of opinion \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending said every morning when we reached room six. We expected the remark. The intern would begin the presentation, and it was always the same. \"This is ICU day 28 for Mr Johnson, a 26-year-old cowboy with pneumonia, sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure and anaemia ...\" A detailed analysis of each problem, in descending order of severity, then ensued. He was growing steadily worse. The ventilator had been at maximum settings for weeks, supplying the man's ruined lungs with just enough oxygen to ensure another identical presentation the next morning. \"This is ICU day 29 for Mr Johnson ...\" \"I don't think any of us here seriously expects this man to survive,\" the attending would say, and we would move on, halfway through rounds and already worn out. Mr Johnson was a bullrider, thrown at a local rodeo, who had broken several ribs. He'd gotten up, dusted himself off, gone home, and over a few days he had developed pneumonia in his injured lung. His family brought him in nearly unconscious, with both lungs full of pus, and over the ensuing weeks his other organs also failed: liver, kidneys, intestines. Mr Johnson lay drowning in his own fluid, the fever unrelenting, his family gathering and staring at him. Over the past few days they had stopped coming, consigning him, it seemed, to his fate alone. One night, more than a month into his stay, I was on call when his blood pressure began dropping yet again. The intern and I stood looking at him, swollen like a toad on the ventilator. He always tormented us like this. \"Give him some more fluids,\" I said. \"And let's go up on his dopamine.\" The nurse sighed; she'd heard all this before. Listening to the ragged sounds of his lungs, I thought something had changed. His left lung sounded a bit quieter than it had the night before, an ominous sign. \"All right,\" I said, resigned. \"Let's get a chest X-ray.\" The chest X-ray had not changed much. Looking hard, though, the radiology resident thought he saw a slight difference on the left. \"Could be a pneumo,\" he said, \"though I'm not sure. Let's get a CAT scan.\" He referred to the possibility that air was leaking out of a hole in the lung, collapsing it. The treatment for this is minor surgery, done at the bedside. You cut into the chest between two ribs, insert a finger into the chest cavity, and push the lung out of the way. Then you slide a long plastic tube between the lung and the chest wall. When suction is applied through the tube, air and blood rush out, allowing the lung to re-expand. Mr Johnson had been the victim of this procedure so often that his chest was a mass of wounds that refused to heal and oozed blood-tinged fluid into the bedding. The intern and I looked at each other, shaking our heads. This meant hours of work, wheeling him with his ventilator and multiple IV drips down to the CAT scanner, waiting for the scan to be read, then putting in the chest tube and getting X-rays to make sure we'd done it right. Any chance of sleeping that night vanished. It was already early morning, and we were tired. \"Looks like a pneumo, all right,\" the radiologist said, pointing to the dark mass of air visible on the CAT scan. \"A pretty big one. I'm surprised we didn't see it better on the X-ray.\" Mr Johnson's lung, by the time I finally cut down to it through the deep, soggy tissues of his chest wall, felt exactly like a piece of cork. It was stiff, as if already embalmed. \"You've got to check this out,\" I said to the intern. \"Put on some gloves and feel this thing.\" For a few moments he felt around with his finger, then withdrew it, covered with blood, and held it instinctively up in the air. \"Feels like a piece of meat,\" he said. The next morning we were reprimanded. \"I think we should seriously consider the ethics of performing such aggressive procedures in this man,\" the attending began. \"I should have been called. It's high time, in fact, that we considered withdrawing support altogether.\" There was a long silence. \"He's a young guy,\" I protested. \"And we've done it before. And it helped.\" This was only marginally true. His blood pressure had come up slightly, but it was hard to know why. About this time, another attending came on the service, and for the next few weeks he alternated call nights with his colleague. He had different views. \"This is a young man,\" he would say when we reached room 6. \"This is exactly the kind of patient we should be most aggressive with.\" A bizarre dynamic developed. On even days we did almost nothing, checked no lab work, stopped antibiotics and tube feeds, and nodded solemnly as the attending shook his head and said things like, \"The most important thing we can do now is keep this man comfortable.\" On odd days it was the full-court press. We worked to undo the previous inactivity, checking arterial blood gases, blood cultures and X-rays, adding antibiotics and fluids, tinkering with the ventilator. We nodded solemnly as the attending said things like, \"This man deserves everything we can give him.\" This went on for more than a week, until my tenure in the ICU came to an end and I rotated back to the emergency room, leaving my nightly struggles with Mr Johnson behind. I was glad; he had unfailingly robbed me of sleep, and I had come to dread him. I knew him intimately, had examined him dozens of times, turned him over to look at his back, put my gloved finger in his mouth, in his rectum, into the interior of his chest cavity, and I had never once exchanged a single word with him. He was gone from the waking world, as nearly dead as a human being can be, lying at the edge but never quite crossing over, his body, his animal self just strong, or not strong, enough. I had hoped many times that he would die. About six months later, I was walking down the long hall back to the ER from the cafeteria. It was mid-afternoon, a slow day. The door to the pulmonary clinic was open as I passed. A few patients sat in plastic chairs, waiting for their appointments. In one corner, leaning casually against the wall, a man stood reading a newspaper. The paper obscured his face, but as he turned the page I saw it, and I stopped immediately. I felt a strong and sudden force. It took me a few seconds: I knew the man, I knew his face was signicant, but I didn't know why. Then I realised, disbelieving. \"Mr Johnson?\" I asked tentatively, stepping in through the clinic door. He looked up at me from his newspaper. \"Are you Mr Johnson?\" I asked, beginning to feel foolish. \"Yes,\" he said, looking at me suspiciously. \"Do I know you?\" The secret \"You have to come and see this,\" the nurse said breathlessly, interrupting rounds. \"It's the grossest thing I ever saw.\" It was early on Sunday morning, and the trauma team had been shuffling around the surgical ICU for an hour, trying to impose some order on the carnage of the night before. It was a blur for me by then, a stream of wounds and bodies. There had been only two surgery residents and me, and we had been going for 24 hours straight, trying not to miss something big. I felt jumpy, distant from the world, and the bright, white coats and accusing fingers of the surgery attendings seemed like the fixtures of dreams. I heard myself answering questions, searching my note-cards, I felt numbers emerging from my mouth, but I wasn't really there. I could smell the odour of my body rising from my scrubs, and my feet felt loose and wet in my running shoes. But she got my attention, anyway. She got everybody's. The grossest thing she ever saw ... Her patient lay in his darkened room, heavily sedated on the ventilator. After two weeks, he was getting better, and for the past few days we had all virtually ignored him. A young man, drunk, in his car, the same story again, coming slowly back into the world. \"Watch,\" the nurse said, lifting the ashlight from the bedclothes. We gathered around the bed. With her left hand she moved the clear plastic ventilator tube to the side of the man's mouth, then carefully inserted her fingers between his front teeth and spread them apart. His jaw opened slackly, and she shone the light directly into his mouth. His mouth was like a little pink cave. Inside were dozens of tiny white worms. As we watched, they began to move, to retreat into the darker recesses, away from the light, and in a few seconds they were gone. \"Oh my God,\" one of the residents said. \"They're maggots. He's got maggots in his mouth.\" The room erupted. We were horried, but also excited, exhaustion washed away. He was alive, and we made her do it again. We took turns, switching off the light for a minute or two until the maggots came back, then illuminating them, transxed by their retreat into the dark. \"What we need to do,\" Dr Whistler said, chortling, \"is get a piece of bacon on a string and leave it in his mouth for a while. I've seen this before. This is why we don't like flies in the ICU.\" One of the medical students went down to the cafeteria for the bacon, and before long the news had spread throughout the hospital. Nurses and medical students and residents from other services began filing through his room until finally the charge nurse put a stop to it. \"This isn't a sideshow,\" she said, to settle the matter. Tied to a string, raw and shiny with fat, the bacon worked beautifully. The nurse pulled it out every half hour or so, and each time it was alive with maggots. She wiped them off, dropped them into a bottle of alcohol, then replaced the bacon. \"It's like fishing,\" she said, chuckling, shaking her head. A month or so later, in the trauma clinic, I saw him again, stiff, thin, walking slowly with his cane. The nurse called his name, and he came slowly forward to the desk. We sat a few feet away, and as he stood writing his name on the forms, weak and alive, we whispered: \"That's the maggot man. Remember him? He's right over there.\" No one had told him a thing. Sugar The little girl was running around the room, screeching happily, and when she saw me she hid under the bed. I could see her peering at me from between the legs of the gurney as I stood with her chart in my hand. Her father shook his head, grinned, and looked at his wife. \"I told you there's nothing wrong with her.\" I looked down at the chart. On it the triage nurse had written, in bold black letters, \"Two-year-old acting weird.\" \"I'm Dr Huyler. What can I do for you?\" \"Nothing,\" he said, and his wife hushed him. \"She's not acting right,\" she said. She wore an African print dress, and I found myself staring at the intricate pattern of swirling reds and browns. Her hair was cornrowed, a bead at the end of each strand. \"They're Medicaid,\" the triage nurse had whispered pointedly in my ear. The implication was clear: they wanted something for free. Tylenol, a work excuse. But it was 10 o'clock on a Friday night. \"What has she been doing?\" \"It's kind of hard to explain. She just isn't acting herself. I noticed it right away. But she's been fine ever since we got here.\" \"Can you be more specic?\" I could feel myself getting impatient. There were half a dozen patients waiting, the ER was full. I wondered why they hadn't called their regular paediatrician. \"Well,\" she said, thinking, \"you know how people look when they're staring into a mirror? Kind of blank?\" I nodded. \"She's like that. Only there isn't a mirror. There's nothing there.\" The child's vital signs were completely normal. Her mother coaxed her out from under the bed and held her wriggling in her arms as I listened to her heart and lungs, looked into her ears. I'm uneasy with children. I must have been a cold, white form to her, large, bending down with my stethoscope and light. I could see nothing wrong with her. She looked impeccably cared for, without any sign of the abuse I had been vaguely and secretly considering. I always do. It's been drummed into us. \"Does she have any medical problems at all?\" \"No,\" her father said, anticipating my questions. \"She's always been healthy. She's had all her shots. She's growing like she should, and she can talk a little, only now she won't 'cause she's shy.\" He wagged a finger, and she giggled, hiding her face with the bottle her mother had given her. \"Has she had any recent stress, something that might have upset her?\" They looked at each other. \"I don't think so.\" \"Is there a history of seizures in the family?\" Her mother thought for a while. \"I think my brother might have seizures,\" she said finally, \"but I haven't seen him in a long time.\" \"And right now she's acting normally?\" \"She's fine,\" her father said to his wife. \"Come on, let's go. If she does it again we'll come back. It's past her bedtime.\" I considered what I'd heard. A vague history of blank spells; it could mean anything, from a rare type of seizure to the vagaries of the two-year-old mind. She could see her paediatrician on Monday, I thought. She was a completely normal child. On my way out the door, though, I turned around. \"Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medications? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?\" \"Well, she stays with my mother when we're at work. She takes medicines.\" \"What kind of medicine does she take?\" \"I'm not sure. Something for her blood pressure and a sugar pill.\" Oral hypoglycemics - sugar pills - are among the most dangerous of overdoses. They can drop blood sugar profoundly, cause brain damage, seizures, coma. Designed for adult diabetics, they are long-lasting, and one pill could kill a small child, even many hours later. \"Let's check her blood sugar,\" I said, \"just to be sure. And please call your mother, find out exactly what she takes.\" From the doctor's station I could hear the child shrieking as the nurse drew her blood. Her mother spoke into the phone a few feet away. \"My mother takes glipizide,\" she said, handing me a piece of paper where she'd written it down. \"She ran out of her blood pressure medicine two weeks ago.\" A sugar pill. The nurse came out of the room with a syringe full of blood. The child's mother and I watched as she eased a single drop from the tip of the needle onto the portable blood-sugar machine she held in her hand. It digested the blood for a few seconds, then displayed the number on the screen. Forty-two. \"Is that low?\" her mother asked. \"It's about half of what it should be,\" I replied, stunned. \"She must have taken one of your mother's sugar pills.\" \"My mother is legally blind. She probably dropped one and didn't notice.\" \"We need to keep her in the hospital for at least a day and give her sugar intravenously.\" I said it quietly, half to myself. \"Will she be all right?\" She was afraid, staring at me. \"She'll be fine.\" And suddenly I began to shake. \"But I'm very glad you brought her in. You may have saved her life.\" \"My husband wanted to put her to bed,\" she said softly, looking off down the hall. It was suddenly clear. Sometime that afternoon, the girl had taken the pill, and by the time her parents came home she was showing the effects of low blood sugar: the staring spells, the blank look. \"What did you do when you saw she was acting weird?\" \"We gave her a bottle,\" the father said, standing with us now. \"And then we gave her a sucker.\" They had given her sugar. When she arrived in the ER, her blood sugar had risen enough for her to look and act herself, but it wouldn't have lasted long. Later that night, when the whole family was asleep, it would have fallen again, and she might never have woken up. As I watched the girl skip and jump around us, the pain of the needle forgotten already, I felt sick, cold and damp, terried by what I had almost missed. One question, an afterthought. That was all it had been. From time to time I think about her. I imagine her playing in parks, jumping on the couch, shrieking in the bathtub. I imagine her head teeming with small thoughts, and the motion of her hands, her eyes, alive in the world, going out into it, entering it, decade after decade ahead. \u00a9 Frank Huyler. \u0095 This is an edited extract from The Blood Of Strangers, by Frank Huyler, published by 4th Estate at \u00a310.

      "bodyText": "Tanni Grey-Thompson was born in Cardiff in 1969. She has spina bifida and was forced into a wheelchair at an early age. Having graduated in politics, she went on to become a full-time athlete. She won her first medal at the Seoul Paralympics in 1988. Last year, she won four gold medals at the Sydney Paralympics in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m wheelchair races. She has been awarded an MBE and an OBE, is married, and lives in Birmingham. What is your idea of perfect happiness? Sitting outside, somewhere warm, with my family, nice food and wine. What is your greatest fear? Being stuck in a room with a spider and not able to scare it. Which living person do you most admire? My parents for putting up with me. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Not admitting I am wrong, or if I do hating it so much. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Selfishness. What has been your most embarrassing moment? Falling out of my chair by my sponsored car, and being recognised. What is your greatest extravagance? My wedding dress, but worth it! What objects do you always carry with you? Diary, mobile, credit cards. What do you most dislike about your appearance? Sticky out ears. What is your favourite saying? I'd rather have my head boiled. Should the Royal Family be scrapped? No, just used better. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes, that's why I got married. What or who is the greatest love of your life? Husband/athletics - don't ask me to choose. What is your greatest regret? Not having my nose pierced when I was young enough to do it. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? Instantaneous time travel. What would your motto be? Aim high, even if you hit a cabbage. What keeps you awake at night? Too many things to worry about and how I can fit in everything I want to do. How would you like to die? Dramatically, but painlessly. Do you believe in life after death? No. How would you like to be remembered? As a good, dedicated athlete, who put something back. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Keep working hard, and don't give up.",

Of course, you'd be wasting your time if you spend half an hour doing flattery so subtle that they go away thinking you're dull. </p> <p>The easiest way to flatter boring people is to pretend everything they say is interesting.

Some people love themselves to pieces, so advanced flattery techniques are required. Try telling them that they're just too hard on themselves. For people who love themselves, this would be a worrying omission, so you can then become their consultant to increase their love for themselves.

Braisable quadrupeds: beef (topside, chuck, rump tip), lamb (shoulder and leg), pork (belly and shoulder). Braisable feathered things: duck legs, oversized geese, pigeon, tough pheasant. Where to buy: Heavy cast-iron casseroles, the braiser's best buddy, are cheapest in the January sales. The easy way out: Practice makes perfect - honest!",

      "body": "<p>\"The emergency room is a very strange, surreal place at times,\" says Frank Huyler. \"You have these very intense moments where you're asking these very personal questions of people who are strangers to you, who often don't know your name and won't remember you, either. There's a facelessness on both sides, and yet you're propelled into moments where you discuss issues that you never would in another world. There is a kind of 'distant intimacy'.\" </p> <p>These moments are what Huyler captures in the stories contained in The Blood Of Strangers. Often very short, the individual stories sometimes appear as Weegie-like snapshots of the crash victims, Aids patients, cardiac arrestees and fellow physicians who come through the ER. </p> <p>Huyler, who has just turned 36, is a doctor practising emergency medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Writing is a sideline; he has had poetry published, but this is his first book. Billed, by his British publisher at least, as \"true stories\", the collection, in fact, has much more the quality of literary fiction - the writing is pared down and precise. The Doctor's Stories of William Carlos Williams was, Huyler says, his closest model, but the flavour of these, in their clinical detachment, is almost Carver-esque. They are not literal truth, but they are based on real events. </p> <p>\"You tend to find,\" explains Huyler, \"that you're witness to an endless procession of similar events - or maybe dissimilar events - but they share in their intensity and tragedy. They kind of blur together; they become this wash. One of the benefits of writing was that it forced me to step back a bit and try to think about the events from a little more distance and perspective.\" </p> <p>Huyler describes himself, here and in the book, in self-effacingly nondescript terms: average height, skinny, with short, brown hair - a \"jeans-and-sneakers\" kind of guy. Yet, what makes The Blood Of Strangers much richer than a merely random selection of sketches is the subtly-drawn self-portrait that emerges through the stories - charting the mark left by these strangers. </p> <p>\"I didn't know what I would use at first to give them some kind of cohesion,\" he confesses, \"but I settled on using the narrator - my own character development, if you like - for that. But I didn't want to make it all confessional, or self-absorbed and narcissistic. </p> <p>\"I wanted the stories to have the primary impact, but I realised I wanted to put myself in enough to show that they had some effect on me - it's a fine line to walk, I guess.\" </p> <p>The ER is, Huyler admits, \"an environment rich in stories\", but one of his concerns in writing about it was to distance himself from the myths. The problem with Mark Greene and company in the TV drama series ER, says Huyler, is that \"they are far too competent\". </p> <p>\"Most of what we do in the ER are really small moments, not life and death, not big drama. Only some of the time does that happen, and only some of the time, when it does, can we do anything about it. A lot of the time, people who are going to die are going to die no matter what we do.\" </p> <p>What The Blood Of Strangers does par excellence is rehabilitate those \"small moments\". Huyler has a forensic capacity for observation, possibly because he grew up as something of an outsider. He was born, in 1964, in Berkeley, California. His parents were teachers at international schools and the family had an itinerant, globe-trotting existence. Frank actually went to kindergarten in London, but then, in his early teens, the Huylers moved to Iran, a couple of years before the fall of the Shah. </p> <p>He vividly recalls the lead-up to the revolution: \"It was exciting for me as a 13-year-old, but frightening for my parents.\" The family got out just in time, catching a flight out the same day as Ayatollah Khomeini's return. Huyler went to high school in Brazil and Japan, then to study at Williams College, Massachusetts - a \"small, liberal arts college\" - where he majored in English. Only then did he decide on a medical training. </p> <p>Why, I wonder. \"I'm not completely sure,\" replies Huyler, with a sheepish laugh. \"I was always, quite honestly, better at the humanities than the sciences, but somehow the path from studying English, into teaching or whatever, struck me as less practical. At the time, I wanted to do something that would have a real effect on people. It was a mix of a little bit of idealism and a lot of pragmatism.\" </p> <p>After medical schooling in North Carolina, he toured around looking for a residency, eventually settling on Albuquerque in 1993. He qualified in 1996, and has been there ever since. He married last year - being so settled is a little strange: \"Seeing people age is a novelty.\" One pragmatic element in Huyler's choice of emergency medicine was that, more than any other branch of medicine, it gave him time to write. He is now at work on a novel, but has no plans to give up the day job at the moment. </p> <p>\"It keeps you grounded,\" Huyler observes. \"It reminds you of many elemental forces that we often don't see in the developed world.

This increasingly dynamic retailer has Waterside White Chardonnay Colombard 1999 (15.5 points out of 20, \u00a33.99), from South Africa, and jolly delicious it is, too. It is one of those perfect welcome-home-from-the-coalface-darling bottles, where the suggestion of ripe sunshine is the crisp solvent of the day's cares. It goes well with food as well as mood. </p> <p>Now, Sainsbury's and Safeway have Waterside White Colombard Chardonnay 2000 (16 points, \u00a34.49), which is not only a younger vintage but, you will note, changes the order of the grapes. With such a blend, the first named grape is always the more dominant, so we have a different wine here, a touch more stylish and complete than the 1999, and fresher with more mineral bite. Sainsbury's own-label non-vintage Australian Chardonnay (16.5 points, \u00a33.99) has lovely, understated fruit with an excellent structure and delicious, crisp-to-finish stylishness. Magnificent value for money, this energetic wine. As is Sainsbury's non-vintage Chilean Sauvignon Blanc (16.5 points, \u00a33.99), which combines the hint of minerality that the classic sauvignon must convey with delicate melon/lemon fruit and a hint of lime and pear. </p> <p>Sainsbury's Chilean Chardonnay (16 points, \u00a34.49) has length of flavour (ogen melon with very subtle spicing) and concentration that result in a delicious mouthful. From New Zealand, Sainsbury's has The Sanctuary Chardonnay 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.49) and The Sanctuary Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (17 points, \u00a35.49). The chardonnay is textured like a wine costing a vastly greater sum; it also has oily plumpness with finesse, a gentle melonosity and a superb finish of some style. The sauvignon offers superb layers of minerals, melon, lemon, raspberry, cobnuts and apples. Beautifully thought-provoking, keenly priced and deliciously fruited, it has a crisp finish. Neither of these Kiwis is at every branch (call 0800 632262 for details).</p> <p>More widely distributed is Sainsbury's Chianti la Capacannuccia 1999 (14.5 points, \u00a32.99) which is dry, slightly smoky and spicy, with deep and decisive tannins and rich fruit. At Thresher and Victoria Wines there are various bargains on offer until January 17. From Australia, Penfolds Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz 1997 (17 points, normally \u00a38.99, but you can pick up three bottles for \u00a320) is quite gorgeous and uplifting. It smothers the palate with prunes, blackberries and liquorice, and then lifts the heart. At Wine Rack and Bottoms Up is Dashwood Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99 or two bottles for \u00a312), from New Zealand. It parades ripe gooseberries, lemon and melon, all impressively textured. Church Road Chardonnay 1998 (16 points, on offer at \u00a37.99) is also from NZ. It has deliciously, smoky flavours and firmly textured fruit. </p> <p>Thresher has Norton Semillon Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, on offer at \u00a33.99), from Argentina, which offers fantastic plumpness and richness of purpose together with baked melon vinosity, soft textured acids and a gorgeous finish. Also from Argentina, there is Corazon Tempranillo 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49, or three for \u00a310): vivacious, exotic, sexy, concentrated and cheap. It's at branches of Thresher and Victoria Wine, as are all the wines that follow: Black Chardonnay 1998 (16.5 points, on offer at \u00a34.99), from New Zealand, displays a wonderful clash of baked melon/ pineapple with fresh lemon acids. This is a remarkable price for a first-rate Kiwi chardonnay and, frankly, I'd snap it up before my wife gets to hear about it.</p> <p>Bonterra Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16 points, offer price \u00a37.99), from California, has textured, deep, blackcurrant riches and is a classy, organic specimen. Hardy's Stamp Of Australia Chardonnay Semillon 1999 (15 points, on offer at \u00a33.49), from Down Under, has a gentle, toffeed/butterscotch edge, almost like butterscotch, with harmonising and charming lemon acids. With Cono Sur Merlot 1999 (16 points, down to \u00a33.99), from Chile, on the other hand, it is the rich, soft texture that carries the points. The fruit is in decent plummy shape, too, but the sheer velvet of the delivery is superlative.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> December 26 2000</strong> </p> <p>On Boxing Day in Britain, all essential organs are paralysed, as if the spinal cord of the country has been hit by a curare dart. In France, they do things differently: in Beauvais, about 60km from Paris, it's possible to get a train or a bus or to see a doctor for a consultation. A friend who is staying with us has developed a painful eruption on her face. I agree to act as interpreter and take her to a pharmacy. </p> <p>There are at least four in the centre of this small town. In the one we choose, they are keen to dispense advice, to phone to make an appointment for my friend to see a doctor, and to draw a map showing directions: \" Allez tout droit \u00e0 Burton's .\" Burton's, the tailor, now all but extinct in Britain, acts as our lighthouse. </p> <p>After a short wait, the examination is done and the diagnosis delivered: it's \" le zona \" - shingles. After consulting what looks like her exam notes, she makes a long list of ointments and antibiotics. The fee: 115F (\u00a311), accompanied by an insurance claim form. We get the drugs and another claim form from the pharmacy, cost (it's the antibiotics): 875F. </p> <p>We have a long conversation about the differences between medical services in France and Britain. None of us knows how the French medical system works. Presumably the doctor's bill and prescription costs are reclaimable. We are certain of only one thing: in Britain we would still be sitting in a casualty department. </p> <p>Later a spontaneous focus group led by the younger members of our party (mostly in their 20s) discusses: is France better than Britain? The virtues of France are construed as follows: it's cleaner, they play better football, the trains stay on the rails, they make champagne and foie gras (this is a very non-PC group), every small town has a market, they are courteous, they present food stylishly, they wrap things artfully in shops, they have Asterix and a foreign policy which isn't sycophantically pro-American. It's also possible to get a good four-course meal and copious wine for \u00a330 a head. Why is almost everything cheaper in France than in Britain? </p> <p>The bad things are poor graphic design, hyper-kitsch flower arrangements, terrible TV, worse pop, Serge Gainsbourg (shouldn't he be on both lists?), odious lapdogs carried like parcels, unavailability of fresh milk, bad handwriting, reluctance to allow pedestrians to cross the road, and racism. This is followed by a complaint that France is too full of French people, and, as an afterthought, that France is too full of English people. </p> <p>But, I say, what's good about Britain? We have good road signs, proper breakfasts, good meat, cheese, bread, Cornish pasties, beautiful countryside, hedgerows, impressive public ceremonies, even temperament, and an extraordinarily supple language and rich literature. And that seems to be it. I'm beginning to see why John Major ended up extolling warm beer and old ladies bicycling to evensong, and why car boot sales featured in the Dome's Self-Portrait section. But what we don't have, says my wife, is this: we don't speak up for ourselves. We don't know who we are. </p> <p><strong> December 27</strong> </p> <p>The next day I see little evidence to doubt the strength of the French identity in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, where there is a memorial which commemorates the signing of the first world war armistice. The forest, which concealed a network of railway tracks and heavy artillery installations, was cleared for the train of the allied forces commander, Marshal Foch, and a train for the German deputation. The dining car in which the signing took place (or a copy) is inside a small museum and contains the table across which Foch forced the Germans to plead for an armistice. </p> <p>Also in the museum are hundreds of photographs of the war viewed through stereo viewers in 3D. Outside the museum, through a mist, we can see two railway lines bowing outwards, either side of a monolithic granite slab which celebrates in huge letters the victory of the allies over the \"proud and arrogant German Empire\". It was these words and the humiliating terms of the armistice that drew Hitler to this spot to demand the French surrender in 1940.

      "bodyText": "December 26 2000 On Boxing Day in Britain, all essential organs are paralysed, as if the spinal cord of the country has been hit by a curare dart. In France, they do things differently: in Beauvais, about 60km from Paris, it's possible to get a train or a bus or to see a doctor for a consultation. A friend who is staying with us has developed a painful eruption on her face. I agree to act as interpreter and take her to a pharmacy. There are at least four in the centre of this small town. In the one we choose, they are keen to dispense advice, to phone to make an appointment for my friend to see a doctor, and to draw a map showing directions: \" Allez tout droit \u00e0 Burton's .\" Burton's, the tailor, now all but extinct in Britain, acts as our lighthouse. After a short wait, the examination is done and the diagnosis delivered: it's \" le zona \" - shingles. After consulting what looks like her exam notes, she makes a long list of ointments and antibiotics. The fee: 115F (\u00a311), accompanied by an insurance claim form. We get the drugs and another claim form from the pharmacy, cost (it's the antibiotics): 875F. We have a long conversation about the differences between medical services in France and Britain. None of us knows how the French medical system works. Presumably the doctor's bill and prescription costs are reclaimable. We are certain of only one thing: in Britain we would still be sitting in a casualty department. Later a spontaneous focus group led by the younger members of our party (mostly in their 20s) discusses: is France better than Britain? The virtues of France are construed as follows: it's cleaner, they play better football, the trains stay on the rails, they make champagne and foie gras (this is a very non-PC group), every small town has a market, they are courteous, they present food stylishly, they wrap things artfully in shops, they have Asterix and a foreign policy which isn't sycophantically pro-American. It's also possible to get a good four-course meal and copious wine for \u00a330 a head. Why is almost everything cheaper in France than in Britain? The bad things are poor graphic design, hyper-kitsch flower arrangements, terrible TV, worse pop, Serge Gainsbourg (shouldn't he be on both lists?), odious lapdogs carried like parcels, unavailability of fresh milk, bad handwriting, reluctance to allow pedestrians to cross the road, and racism. This is followed by a complaint that France is too full of French people, and, as an afterthought, that France is too full of English people. But, I say, what's good about Britain? We have good road signs, proper breakfasts, good meat, cheese, bread, Cornish pasties, beautiful countryside, hedgerows, impressive public ceremonies, even temperament, and an extraordinarily supple language and rich literature. And that seems to be it. I'm beginning to see why John Major ended up extolling warm beer and old ladies bicycling to evensong, and why car boot sales featured in the Dome's Self-Portrait section. But what we don't have, says my wife, is this: we don't speak up for ourselves. We don't know who we are. December 27 The next day I see little evidence to doubt the strength of the French identity in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, where there is a memorial which commemorates the signing of the first world war armistice. The forest, which concealed a network of railway tracks and heavy artillery installations, was cleared for the train of the allied forces commander, Marshal Foch, and a train for the German deputation. The dining car in which the signing took place (or a copy) is inside a small museum and contains the table across which Foch forced the Germans to plead for an armistice. Also in the museum are hundreds of photographs of the war viewed through stereo viewers in 3D. Outside the museum, through a mist, we can see two railway lines bowing outwards, either side of a monolithic granite slab which celebrates in huge letters the victory of the allies over the \"proud and arrogant German Empire\". It was these words and the humiliating terms of the armistice that drew Hitler to this spot to demand the French surrender in 1940. He ordered the historic railway carriage to be taken to Berlin and the entire site was ransacked. After the war, the French restored the site to its pre-1940 state, but there is little documentation of the surrender - or of British participation in the armistice. December 28 I've been given an updated Trivial Pursuit for Christmas and make the frequent mistake of imagining that entertainment is a safe category.

The title story tells of a Ghanaian immigrant's experience of London; \"Debauchery\" of an American in Paris in search of authenticity. The common theme is that of work and identity: the struggle to keep person and position apart, or the way the two merge into one, is the common theme. Thorpe controls well the cadences and impressions of his disparate characters: the voices flow but never meander sluggishly. </p> <p> <strong> A Sweetheart Deal</strong><br> Ben Richards<br> (Review, \u00a36.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502426588,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> On the back cover, Richards leans out from the balcony of a redbrick council block. It is just the kind of place in which one of his Londoners might live: not fashionable but with plenty of hard edges softened by bohemian possibility and affordable rents. Perhaps it is where Mel Holloway lives? She is a union organiser who has fond memories of the GLC but keeps out of the factional fighting between the modernisers and diehards. A lab technician, scape-goated after a blood mismatch leaves a train accident victim dead, draws Mel to the man's widow and to bleak thoughts about work, home and love. Richards, with three London novels behind him, writes with a political bite that newcomers to the genre lack. </p> <p> <strong> The Funeral Party</strong><br> Ludmilla Ulitskaya <br> (Indigo, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502318740,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Alik has spent years in America, yet never quite managed to leave Russia behind him. As his friends - fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Russian Jews and dreamers - gather around his bed during a stifling New York summer to watch over his death, they learn to let go both of Alik and the Russia of their pasts. The first of Ulitskaya's novels to be translated into English, this is a sentimental, overly emotional, black-bread-and-vodka work, but is also opulently lyrical. Irina, Alik's first love, seems almost to have pushed her Russianness away, while his wife, Nina, carries with her always an illogical Slavic mysticism. Only Alik seems to have made peace with his upbringing. Ulitskaya's theme is resonant, though some readers may find her unalloyed \"Russian soul\" cloying. </p> <p> <strong> Under The Skin</strong>&lt;BR.

Isserley drives along the A9 in the north of Scotland, on the look-out for hitchhikers. They must be men, well-muscled and alone. She picks them up in a little red Toyota and sets off in whatever direction they want to go. The men revolt her, but afford her the happiness of walking the firth and communing with the sheep. Her passengers, meanwhile, find Isserley odd: strange face and odd accent, but an unbelievable pair of tits. Faber's dystopia is, in places, predictable, but its message is conveyed with compelling originality. </p>",

And the book that launched this extraordinarily successful writing streak in 1993, Bravo Two Zero, has sold 1.5m copies in this country alone. Its author shakes his head in happy disbelief. \"It's a fantastic life,\" he exclaims with an engaging shrug. \"It was the right time, and luck.\" </p> <p>The right time was the aftermath of the Gulf war. (Just as importantly for SAS scribblers, the Iranian embassy siege in London 10 years earlier had brought the regiment to wide public attention.) Three years after the Gulf war, McNab - like Nick Stone, hero of his thrillers - was leaving the Army to take up a job in private security: a popular move, he says, for special-forces members hitting their mid-30s. But first he and the four other survivors of the abortive Bravo Two Zero mission behind enemy lines in the Gulf were invited to a Christmas dinner by General Sir Peter de la Billi\u00e8re, senior British commander in the coalition forces, who was toying with writing a book about the eight-man patrol. </p> <p>\"I thought I'd rather try to do it myself,\" McNab recalls. He rang John Nichol, the RAF navigator whose book, Tornado Down, about being shot down by an Iraqi missile, had recently been published. \"I asked him: 'How do you do this book business?'\" </p> <p>Nichol put him in touch with an agent, Mark Lucas. McNab began writing a proposal. \"It was in the third person and it was crap,\" he remembers. He then tried rewriting it in the first person, after being advised: \"Just do it as if you were talking to somebody in a pub.\" </p> <p>In fact, he found the first book easier than expected. \"Because of the debriefing system and the number of presentations I'd done in the army, I knew the story, even three years later. What I didn't know about was texture. Mark Lucas kept on saying: 'What about the taste, the smell? How did those wet trousers feel?'\" </p> <p>Apart from a taste for medieval history, acquired during the 1980s to help him argue with a comrade who had become a born-again Christian, McNab readily confesses that he does not read books. He left school at 15 to deliver coal in Brixton. The army educated him. He joined the Junior Leaders regiment at 16 and was immediately plonked in a classroom for six months to catch up on the three Rs. </p> <p>Lucas shrewdly decided that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 would do two non-fiction books first to establish a readership - and it worked. Nearly half his readers are women, which surprises and delights McNab. SAS mania peaked in the second half of the 1990s, and the mass readership moved on. But McNab wasn't left behind: he had already prepared the ground for his thrillers. </p> <p>He is now contracted to write five novels about Nick Stone, an ex-SAS freelance operator hired to carry out deniable operations for British intelligence - the sort of life McNab says he might have led himself if the writing hadn't intervened. The five are to be made into films, and he has spent the last year in Los Angeles learning how to be a producer. </p> <p>His creative process sounds complex. First he comes up with a selection of plots for Lucas. \"I present 100 to 130 storylines, sentences and bullet points.\" And to grab the vital American market, there must be a strong US element, which is one reason why Lucas rejected McNab's first suggestion for a Bosnian setting. \"The Americans aren't too sure where that is.\" </p> <p>He typically ends up with a storyline of about 15 pages, usually in bullet points on his laptop. He then starts filling in the scenes around them. (His chief influence, he explains, was not books but the film and TV he watched as a child - from Jackanory and Thunderbirds onwards - which taught him to visualise scenes.) </p> <p>Once the scenes are in his head, he \"talks\" them into a tape recorder and transcribes what emerges. The result is a template of about 250 pages, which is then remodelled into about 40 chapter-length chunks. </p> <p>He tries to start his day with a run and workout before getting down to five or six hours at the keyboard. Currently he prefers lying flat out on a sofa with the laptop propped on a cushion on his stomach. </p> <p>His rarest gift is authenticity. Everything he writes about - from picking a lock, to climbing a wall, to firing a gun in anger - he has done himself. \"K\", the deniable operations unit that Stone works and kills for, is based on reality, he says. \"All governments have them.\" </p> <p>Isn't that disturbing? \"Why?\" he demands. \"It's the way that western culture is. Everybody wants democracy and freedom. Actually, initially it had to be fought for, and it still has to be fought for. So, these things go on.\" </p> <p>Although the Ministry of Defence has criticised the genre in public, McNab insists that everything he has written has been submitted for vetting, amended if necessary and then cleared. He says he has never been critical of the military high command in his books, but he does not contradict the accusations in another insider's account of the Iraq mission - Mike Coburn's forthcoming Soldier 5, which recently fought off a legal challenge from the MoD in New Zealand. \"The fact is,\" McNab explains, \"that you are paid to do a job and there's a war on.

      "body": "<p><strong> Mr Phillips</strong><br> John Lanchester<br> (Faber, \u00a36.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000369412,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> I had my reservations about this one. Lanchester's previous and first novel, The Debt to Pleasure, I had left mostly unread; there was too much of an odour of Nabokov coming off the book. Still, reviewers loved it, and it won more prizes than I have space to mention. Now this novel is about its eponymous hero's thoughts and feelings as he wanders around London during the course of a single day. Mr Phillips is a reasonably kind-hearted, randy nonentity. What does that remind you of? </p> <p>If nothing else, one could be impressed by Lanchester's sheer cheek. Lanchester, an intelligent and trustworthy critic himself, cannot be unaware of the possibility of comparison. What on earth could he have been thinking of, apart from, \"I know - I'll write a book that isn't as good as Ulysses \"? </p> <p>Still, many critics, including our own, loved this book to bits as well. Adam Phillips, whose opinions on such matters I used to revere, said it was \"exceptionally funny\"; Allan Massie said its \"comedy\" was \"rich and humane\", which is at least a more honestly decipherable way of saying \"the kind of comedy which does not actually make you laugh\". </p> <p>I should point out that there may well be something wrong with me that prevents me from finding it as hilarious as everyone else seems to. (I did laugh out loud on page 168.) There are people for whom The Diary of a Nobody is not a comedy but a heartrending, Chekhovian tragedy, a book that cannot be read without hyperventilating with painful compassion; I'm one of them. And this might be the case here. I suggest that you go to a shop and read a couple of its pages of flat, busted English (the prose is almost a textbook example of style indirecte libre), and if you like them, then buy the book: it's like that all the way through. </p> <p>This doesn't look very much like a recommendation.

      "bodyText": "Mr Phillips John Lanchester (Faber, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL I had my reservations about this one. Lanchester's previous and first novel, The Debt to Pleasure, I had left mostly unread; there was too much of an odour of Nabokov coming off the book. Still, reviewers loved it, and it won more prizes than I have space to mention. Now this novel is about its eponymous hero's thoughts and feelings as he wanders around London during the course of a single day. Mr Phillips is a reasonably kind-hearted, randy nonentity. What does that remind you of? If nothing else, one could be impressed by Lanchester's sheer cheek. Lanchester, an intelligent and trustworthy critic himself, cannot be unaware of the possibility of comparison. What on earth could he have been thinking of, apart from, \"I know - I'll write a book that isn't as good as Ulysses \"? Still, many critics, including our own, loved this book to bits as well. Adam Phillips, whose opinions on such matters I used to revere, said it was \"exceptionally funny\"; Allan Massie said its \"comedy\" was \"rich and humane\", which is at least a more honestly decipherable way of saying \"the kind of comedy which does not actually make you laugh\". I should point out that there may well be something wrong with me that prevents me from finding it as hilarious as everyone else seems to. (I did laugh out loud on page 168.) There are people for whom The Diary of a Nobody is not a comedy but a heartrending, Chekhovian tragedy, a book that cannot be read without hyperventilating with painful compassion; I'm one of them. And this might be the case here. I suggest that you go to a shop and read a couple of its pages of flat, busted English (the prose is almost a textbook example of style indirecte libre), and if you like them, then buy the book: it's like that all the way through. This doesn't look very much like a recommendation. But while one may be suspicious of the novelist's attitude towards his hero (look at me being even-handed yet at the same time movingly generous about an ordinary person!), I, for my part, am suspicious of my own suspicion. It is the kind of book that may turn out to be very good after all, but whose qualities are only revealed after days, weeks, or even years of thinking about it. So I may well be missing something here. It reads as if it took about two weeks to write; three, if we include some research on double-entry book-keeping to give Mr Phillips's past as an accountant some plausibility.

      "body": "<p>\"The emergency room is a very strange, surreal place at times,\" says Frank Huyler. \"You have these very intense moments where you're asking these very personal questions of people who are strangers to you, who often don't know your name and won't remember you, either. There's a facelessness on both sides, and yet you're propelled into moments where you discuss issues that you never would in another world. There is a kind of 'distant intimacy'.\" </p> <p>These moments are what Huyler captures in the stories contained in The Blood Of Strangers. Often very short, the individual stories sometimes appear as Weegie-like snapshots of the crash victims, Aids patients, cardiac arrestees and fellow physicians who come through the ER. </p> <p>Huyler, who has just turned 36, is a doctor practising emergency medicine in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Writing is a sideline; he has had poetry published, but this is his first book. Billed, by his British publisher at least, as \"true stories\", the collection, in fact, has much more the quality of literary fiction - the writing is pared down and precise. The Doctor's Stories of William Carlos Williams was, Huyler says, his closest model, but the flavour of these, in their clinical detachment, is almost Carver-esque. They are not literal truth, but they are based on real events. </p> <p>\"You tend to find,\" explains Huyler, \"that you're witness to an endless procession of similar events - or maybe dissimilar events - but they share in their intensity and tragedy. They kind of blur together; they become this wash. One of the benefits of writing was that it forced me to step back a bit and try to think about the events from a little more distance and perspective.\" </p> <p>Huyler describes himself, here and in the book, in self-effacingly nondescript terms: average height, skinny, with short, brown hair - a \"jeans-and-sneakers\" kind of guy. Yet, what makes The Blood Of Strangers much richer than a merely random selection of sketches is the subtly-drawn self-portrait that emerges through the stories - charting the mark left by these strangers. </p> <p>\"I didn't know what I would use at first to give them some kind of cohesion,\" he confesses, \"but I settled on using the narrator - my own character development, if you like - for that. But I didn't want to make it all confessional, or self-absorbed and narcissistic. </p> <p>\"I wanted the stories to have the primary impact, but I realised I wanted to put myself in enough to show that they had some effect on me - it's a fine line to walk, I guess.\" </p> <p>The ER is, Huyler admits, \"an environment rich in stories\", but one of his concerns in writing about it was to distance himself from the myths. The problem with Mark Greene and company in the TV drama series ER, says Huyler, is that \"they are far too competent\". </p> <p>\"Most of what we do in the ER are really small moments, not life and death, not big drama. Only some of the time does that happen, and only some of the time, when it does, can we do anything about it. A lot of the time, people who are going to die are going to die no matter what we do.\" </p> <p>What The Blood Of Strangers does par excellence is rehabilitate those \"small moments\". Huyler has a forensic capacity for observation, possibly because he grew up as something of an outsider. He was born, in 1964, in Berkeley, California. His parents were teachers at international schools and the family had an itinerant, globe-trotting existence. Frank actually went to kindergarten in London, but then, in his early teens, the Huylers moved to Iran, a couple of years before the fall of the Shah. </p> <p>He vividly recalls the lead-up to the revolution: \"It was exciting for me as a 13-year-old, but frightening for my parents.\" The family got out just in time, catching a flight out the same day as Ayatollah Khomeini's return. Huyler went to high school in Brazil and Japan, then to study at Williams College, Massachusetts - a \"small, liberal arts college\" - where he majored in English. Only then did he decide on a medical training. </p> <p>Why, I wonder. \"I'm not completely sure,\" replies Huyler, with a sheepish laugh. \"I was always, quite honestly, better at the humanities than the sciences, but somehow the path from studying English, into teaching or whatever, struck me as less practical. At the time, I wanted to do something that would have a real effect on people. It was a mix of a little bit of idealism and a lot of pragmatism.\" </p> <p>After medical schooling in North Carolina, he toured around looking for a residency, eventually settling on Albuquerque in 1993. He qualified in 1996, and has been there ever since. He married last year - being so settled is a little strange: \"Seeing people age is a novelty.\" One pragmatic element in Huyler's choice of emergency medicine was that, more than any other branch of medicine, it gave him time to write. He is now at work on a novel, but has no plans to give up the day job at the moment. </p> <p>\"It keeps you grounded,\" Huyler observes. \"It reminds you of many elemental forces that we often don't see in the developed world. It's very easy to hide yourself away, but in an ER room you're constantly reminded of those forces.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Read an extract from The Blood of Strangers <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,418382,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

If so, she could well have taken into consideration the lugubrious pronouncements of an earlier fictional character, and been considerably put off. \"I think that no one has the necessary right to publish what they know - however good it might be for them to write it,\" cautions Cassandra, the portentously named character in The Game, an early novel by Drabble's sister, AS Byatt. It was published in the same year that Drabble herself wrote Jerusalem the Golden, a novel characterised by a young heroine who seeks to escape the cheerless world of her upbringing. </p> <p>Cassandra, a don eventually driven to suicide by the fictional borrowings of her novelist sister, detects in the creative process not an inevitable confrontation of truth but a possible means of escape from it: \"If we imagine our experience we transmute it - rearrange it, meditate on it, light it differently ... the imagination can be violently dangerous. Not enough - a mere recording - is valueless. Too much is an evasion of truth.\" </p> <p> The Peppered Moth is a novel about Drabble's - and, of course, Byatt's - mother. This much is beyond critical fancy, because Drabble states it in uncompromising terms in an afterword that strikes one as very much like the optical illusion that shows at one moment the appearance of a duck, the next a rabbit, but never both at the same time. Invoking the myth of the woman who enters the underworld to search for a loved one, and by way of disguise covers herself in \"dead rat water\", Drabble confides: \"I have made myself smell of dead rat, and I am not sure how to get rid of the smell.\" Is this melodramatic image self-serving apology or poignant evidence of the novelist's abiding moral dilemma? Can one borrow from the dead without becoming a grave-robber? </p> <p>It is the novel's obsession with the dead that begins to give answers to these pressing and uncomfortable questions. They pile up on its pages, in the massed ranks of genealogical tables and the individual agonies of deathbeds, in memory and speculation, in inherited possessions and characteristics that torment and thwart the unsuspecting living. Although this novel is deeply flawed - in its fussy construction, its infuriatingly uneven tone, its improbable plotlines - its impressive achievement is to animate the dead and to address, with bold face, their hold over us. </p> <p>Drabble begins in two places at once. In a Methodist chapel in South Yorkshire, she introduces the representative of the living, \"bobby-dazzler\" Faro Gaulden, a science journalist whose vitality is undermined by morbid tendencies in the shape of her reluctant attachment to a gloomy, manipulative boyfriend and her simultaneous fascination with and fear of the vertiginous possibilities of genetic research. As she abandons herself to the DNA swabs of the professor who has come to Breaseborough to search for the links between the living and a recently discovered 8,000-year-old skeleton, the camera draws back to reveal tiny Bessie Bawtry, a gifted child seeking sanctuary in private rituals beneath the parlour table in the early years of the 20th century. </p> <p>Bessie, it quickly becomes clear, is the shade that haunts Drabble; her progression as the novel's living spectre provides its best and worst moments. With an extraordinary sensitivity and acuteness, Drabble recreates Bessie's early life as a precocious child painfully compelled to escape her environment - the unforgiving coal dust and squalor, the obligingly unaffectionate parents - through an enormous effort of will. She patiently evokes the \"nightmare of the forced brain trapped in its skullcage\" as Bessie sweats over her schoolbooks and battles her way into Cambridge, and delicately anatomises the fatal loss of nerve that consigns her to a lifetime of bitterness and regret. </p> <p>As a study in the neurosis engendered by the solitary life of the clever child, The Peppered Moth promises to be superb. As Bessie is gifted with intelligence and singlemindedness, she is also cursed with hypersensitivity, emotional imbalance, hypochondria, fearfulness and pride. At each new hurdle, she must overcome the legacy of inertia that, Drabble suggests, has been bred into her, and is engaged in a vicious turf war with her own instabilities. </p> <p>It is not a battle that she can win. Drabble's powerful theme is that evolution - whether it be a straightforward Darwinian fight for survival or the Lamarckian theory of adaptability favoured by Faro - takes time. If one generation begins to dig the escape tunnel, another will emerge into the daylight; there will be casualties along the way. </p> <p>This fatalistic observation is also Drabble's undoing, because it allows her to treat Bessie with an almost casual sadism: just when she should take up the responsibilities of the novelist toward her creation, she slips into the comfortable ignorances of the historian. Suddenly Bessie's inner life, so confidently and compassionately nurtured, withers into nothingness. Here she is, marrying her childhood sweetheart, and thus ruining both their lives for ever, and here is Drabble on the subject: \"It is not clear why they married at all. But they did ... I have tried - and I apologise for that intrusive authorial 'I', which I have done my best to avoid - I have tried to understand why Joe and Bessie married, and I have tried to invent some plausible dialogue for them that might explain it.\" This, one is tempted to say, is not good enough; it is passing the buck. If that seems a harsh judgment, then consider what else happens to Bessie, who becomes a monster - a selfish, repressive mother, a bullying, whimpering wife, an overgrown child. It is hard not to see in these passages a hint of retrospective sadism as we encounter Bessie's \"deformed and dangling bosom\" and the \"folds of white tripe flesh above her thighs\". </p> <p>As Drabble throws herself behind the living, her dead characters increasingly begin to resemble Larkin's \"fools in old-style hats and coats\", which is both support for her arguments about the arrogance of the present and evidence of unfortunate weakness. Although her descriptions of the past appear meticulously researched and painstakingly realised, they are just that: borrowings from the archive that, like many of the scientific subplots - the endless tattoo of DNA and matrilineal descent - function as distractions and alibis. </p> <p>There are serious problems with The Peppered Moth, but it also displays commendable strengths, not least a proper engagement with our dangerous imperative to create narrative out of the problematic ebb and flow of life. \"Descend with me,\" Faro's sickly lover mawkishly implores, to which she can only think: \"People do not talk like that, in the late 20th century. They talk and live in the upper reaches, in the rapid shallows. Nobody goes down there any more, not even the dead and the dying. There is nothing down there any more.\" </p> <p>Drabble, of course, knows better.</p>",

If that seems a harsh judgment, then consider what else happens to Bessie, who becomes a monster - a selfish, repressive mother, a bullying, whimpering wife, an overgrown child. It is hard not to see in these passages a hint of retrospective sadism as we encounter Bessie's \"deformed and dangling bosom\" and the \"folds of white tripe flesh above her thighs\". As Drabble throws herself behind the living, her dead characters increasingly begin to resemble Larkin's \"fools in old-style hats and coats\", which is both support for her arguments about the arrogance of the present and evidence of unfortunate weakness. Although her descriptions of the past appear meticulously researched and painstakingly realised, they are just that: borrowings from the archive that, like many of the scientific subplots - the endless tattoo of DNA and matrilineal descent - function as distractions and alibis. There are serious problems with The Peppered Moth, but it also displays commendable strengths, not least a proper engagement with our dangerous imperative to create narrative out of the problematic ebb and flow of life. \"Descend with me,\" Faro's sickly lover mawkishly implores, to which she can only think: \"People do not talk like that, in the late 20th century. They talk and live in the upper reaches, in the rapid shallows. Nobody goes down there any more, not even the dead and the dying. There is nothing down there any more.\" Drabble, of course, knows better.",

Its cargo was a surplus of prostitutes, shop-lifters and pick-pockets taken from equally crammed and disease-infested gaols. </p> <p>While the supposed object of this transportation was to rid the country of its unwanted while clearing the prisons to make room for more, the real motive was not reduction but production. The cargo of the Lady Julian was destined to control the \"irregular\" urges of the inhabitants of Botony Bay in New South Wales, the fledgling, and as yet male, penal colony housing England's marginalised, discarded, and dispossessed. While for the most part the term of imprisonment for the women in this brave new world was only seven years, it was obvious to all that none would return home after serving their time. Not only would the cost of a passage prohibit it, but few would be willing to leave new husbands and children to endure another 11 months of discomfort at sea in order to try search for those they had left behind. </p> <p> The Floating Brothel is a story of bodies and their waste, expulsion and overflow. It is about the late 18th century's attempt to control what is undesirable and about how those expelled then lived in the company of each other's waste. The story Sian Rees tells is, among other things, a vivid, visceral, and riveting account of noxious stenches. Smells are becoming a respectable part of historical writing: Peter Ackroyd devotes a chapter of London: A Biography to bad odours, and Sian Rees gives us an ark of \"dead rats, dead cats, compost of mounds of vegetable peelings, faeces, urine, rotting fabric and decomposing sick\". Those pregnant on board (and there were many, both before and after the journey began) went through morning sickness as well sea sickness, to be followed by labour in a heaving ship, while the others suffered menstrual cycles in which all the soiled sanitation was stored on board. When not expelling, bodies were variously itching. Sexual diseases were hard to avoid given the relations between prisoners and sailors, while the salt in the water used for washing made for irritable groins and other rashes. </p> <p>Such primitive conditions contrast strikingly with the navigational feat of the journey itself, the way in which the ship was drawn \"by an invisible thread of calculations and sights through months of empty horizons - into the mouth of a river [the navigator] had never seen\". Rees is fascinated by the nuts and bolts of sailing; she describes well the vertiginous experience of being aboard ship for the first time, the deafening sound of wind in sails, and the strangeness of the ship's ports of call (Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town) to those who had never left East London, or Lincoln, or Southampton. </p> <p>Many of these women were teenagers (for procreational reasons, the bulk of women were young adults), leaving behind weeping parents, children and lovers, to travel to God only knows where, aboard a creaking, leaking vessel, accompanied by cows they were expected to milk while the waves were as high as mountains (this task was given to cattle thieves) and sailors they were expected to provide with sex. John Nicol, the ship's steward, wrote in his memoirs (republished this month by Canongate as The Life and Adventures of John Nicol, Mariner ): \"Every man on board took a wife from among the convicts, they nothing loath.\" </p> <p> He chose for himself Sarah Whitlam, sent for seven years to Parts Beyond the Seas for stealing a cloak which she claimed to have borrowed from a friend with whom she frequently shared clothes. \"I fixed my fancy on her from the moment I knocked the rivet out of her irons upon the anvil,\" Nicol wrote. But the day after the Lady Julian had begun her return journey, with John Nicol on board grieving for his helpless lover and their newborn son and plotting ways of returning to the colony to rescue her, Sarah Whitlam married another. Like other prisoners, she was determined to cement for herself a viable future. </p> <p>The prisoners Sian Rees has unearthed have uniformly similar names (Sarah, Mary, and Elizabeth) and tales: seduction and abandonment leading to poverty and prostitution; the theft of a yard of material, the theft of a lover's clothes while he enjoyed his postcoital sleep. The most colourful character is Elizabeth Barnsley, the First Lady of the ship, distinguished shoplifter and sister of a dashing highwayman. She wore her own finery during the package and treated her peers to Canary wine when they docked in Tenerife. No doubt she, like Sarah Whitlam, would have made much of her future in Sydney, and not put up long with a life fighting off the sex-starved inhabitants, sleeping in a wattle and daub shack while \"grubbing along the shoreline for bits of oyster shell to grind into lime\" to hold it together. </p> <p> Sian Rees wears her considerable learning lightly, and there is not a dull moment in what is, paradoxically, a wonderfully earthy read. </p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502372940,00.html\">Buy The Life and Adventures of John Nicol, Mariner at BOL</a><br></p>",

Sexual diseases were hard to avoid given the relations between prisoners and sailors, while the salt in the water used for washing made for irritable groins and other rashes. Such primitive conditions contrast strikingly with the navigational feat of the journey itself, the way in which the ship was drawn \"by an invisible thread of calculations and sights through months of empty horizons - into the mouth of a river [the navigator] had never seen\". Rees is fascinated by the nuts and bolts of sailing; she describes well the vertiginous experience of being aboard ship for the first time, the deafening sound of wind in sails, and the strangeness of the ship's ports of call (Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town) to those who had never left East London, or Lincoln, or Southampton. Many of these women were teenagers (for procreational reasons, the bulk of women were young adults), leaving behind weeping parents, children and lovers, to travel to God only knows where, aboard a creaking, leaking vessel, accompanied by cows they were expected to milk while the waves were as high as mountains (this task was given to cattle thieves) and sailors they were expected to provide with sex. John Nicol, the ship's steward, wrote in his memoirs (republished this month by Canongate as The Life and Adventures of John Nicol, Mariner ): \"Every man on board took a wife from among the convicts, they nothing loath.\" He chose for himself Sarah Whitlam, sent for seven years to Parts Beyond the Seas for stealing a cloak which she claimed to have borrowed from a friend with whom she frequently shared clothes. \"I fixed my fancy on her from the moment I knocked the rivet out of her irons upon the anvil,\" Nicol wrote. But the day after the Lady Julian had begun her return journey, with John Nicol on board grieving for his helpless lover and their newborn son and plotting ways of returning to the colony to rescue her, Sarah Whitlam married another. Like other prisoners, she was determined to cement for herself a viable future. The prisoners Sian Rees has unearthed have uniformly similar names (Sarah, Mary, and Elizabeth) and tales: seduction and abandonment leading to poverty and prostitution; the theft of a yard of material, the theft of a lover's clothes while he enjoyed his postcoital sleep. The most colourful character is Elizabeth Barnsley, the First Lady of the ship, distinguished shoplifter and sister of a dashing highwayman. She wore her own finery during the package and treated her peers to Canary wine when they docked in Tenerife. No doubt she, like Sarah Whitlam, would have made much of her future in Sydney, and not put up long with a life fighting off the sex-starved inhabitants, sleeping in a wattle and daub shack while \"grubbing along the shoreline for bits of oyster shell to grind into lime\" to hold it together. Sian Rees wears her considerable learning lightly, and there is not a dull moment in what is, paradoxically, a wonderfully earthy read. \u0095 Buy The Life and Adventures of John Nicol, Mariner at BOL",

And then the story gets juicier: his affair with married actress Joanna Jermyn is revealed, and their secret \"Olympian\" love is dragged down to \"street level\". </p> <p>Like Richard, Joanna is cast as a relic of mythic, vanished Albion; a Hollywood star \"playing a type that no longer existed outside films and plays\". As she drifts unmoored into the heady stratosphere of celebrity in America and he flounders for authenticity in England, their love is battered by politics and celebrity - and by the more usual demons of loneliness and infidelities. </p> <p>Sadly, though Cartwright retains his impressive range of reference and eye for telling detail, this is mostly a very bad book. We flit between the lovers in a strange mixture of steely third-person and rambling interior monologue, rehearsing issues familiar from the last few years of the newspaper comment pages: the travesty of Englishness, the triumph of feeling over intellect in politics and the possible link to the death of Diana, the Boys' Own ennui of being part of a generation never to see active service. </p> <p>The landscape of the novel is a clearly signposted \"real\" world; Joanna appears in medical soap Lake Practice and courts acting cred semi-nude at the Almeida. This makes Cartwright's bad calls - such as the sub-Amis names of his working-class thugs, Carl Panky and Denny Tongle - appear laughably novelistic. The style ranges from clogged portentousness (\"If he hadn't known it before, he knew it now: to be human is to be only partly rational\") to faint risibility (\"Sophie opened the champagne expertly.

Music says of his father: \"he usually wore, apart from a thick serge suit and a shirt with celluloid collars, a meaningless scowl\"; of the Major: \"He had married shortly after the war a woman whose post-natal depression could be traced back, seemingly, to her own birth.\" Anyone who can write sentences like that must be watched.",

One day, a spurned floozie played by Shirley MacLaine gets so upset at being two-timed that she tries to take her life, using a vial of pills she finds in Lemmon's medicine cabinet. Lemmon arrives home to find the comely young elevator operator at death's door. He is devastated. The responsibility of nursing a mentally unhinged person back to full health would be daunting enough, but what further complicates matters is that MacLaine has been dating Lemmon while simultaneously sleeping with Fred MacMurray, who happens to be Lemmon's boss.

Spacey so closely resembles a man I worked for when I started out in this business that every time I see his photo I want to punch out his lights.

For example, in Bringing Out the Dead, which depicts in chilling detail the unrewarding side of the otherwise glamorous ambulance-driving profession, Martin Scorsese has served up the latest installment in the Cruddy Jobs Tetrology that began with Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (why would anyone want to be a waitress?), Taxi Driver (what kind of a jerk would want to drive a cab?) and Goodfellas (you think being a mobster is all glitz and glamour? Fugheddaboutit).</p> <p>But Scorsese is not alone in this milieu. In Glengarry Glen Ross, David Mamet pitilessly unveiled the horrors of the real estate business, much as Sam Mendes would later do in American Beauty. The ethical conflicts that lie at the heart of the brokerage business give Boiler Room, The Last Seduction and Wall Street their special power, just as Clerks derives its strength from its merciless dissection of the monotony endemic in the suburban retail sector. In an even more proletarian setting, films such as Hoffa deal with the effect of strained interpersonal relationships on the work force.</p> <p>Over the years, Hollywood has produced a steady stream of movies showing how stressful it is to be a policeman (Fort Apache, Serpico, The French Connection), a doctor (The Hospital, Madame Bovary, The Island of Dr. Moreau), a lawyer (Philadelphia, The Firm, The Devil's Advocate), a rock star (This Is Spinal Tap, A Star Is Born, Airheads) or an astronaut (Mission to Mars, Red Planet, The Astronaut's Wife). Frankly, these subjects have gotten a bit stale. </p> <p>What a relief it is to see Hollywood narrowing its focus to examine less glamorous industries. For example, buried beneath the clever humour of Being John Malkovich is a searing indictment of workplace environments that do not conform to even the most minimal ergonomic standards. And once one gets past the cloying love story that dominates High Fidelity, it is possible to discern a dispassionate yet clinical analysis of the way unresolved tensions may contribute to storewide unhappiness in a downscale retail environment. </p> <p>In the end, what I am trying to suggest is that this genre of movies succeeds all too well at the task it has set itself.

That's why I don't have a job anymore. </p> <p>The only way you can really enjoy these movies is if you don't have to work for a living. If you do, stay away from them.

Hauled in two weeks early from their summer break, they were quickly carted off to France for pre-season training which included 6.30 wake-up calls, dawn starts and up to three sessions a day. The tone was set. </p> <p>The Frenchman arrives for work at Fulham's Motspur Park training ground at 7.30 each morning and although the players pitch up rather later, two sessions a day remain common. Not that the idea is to run people into the ground. </p> <p>\"The intensity level of training is controlled so the players are peaking for each game,\" says Steve Kean, the youth academy director who has been working closely with Tigana and his coaches. </p> <p>Swimming may be used for post-match recovery if there are fixtures in quick succession, and the day before a game training is invariably low intensity and held as close as possible to the kick-off time, to mould the players' body clocks. Not always easy in winter without floodlights. </p> <p>Under the fitness coach Roger Propos, everything from power and strength to agility and flexibility is worked on. \"The training programme put together by Roger is detailed to a level I've never seen before,\" says Kean, who played at Celtic and in Portugal and has coached at Reading. \"The height of benches they jump from in some of the power sessions is measured in centimetres.\" </p> <p>In the newly updated gym players have personal programmes. Those returning from injury are never rushed back and, after a pre-season which was calculated and gradual rather than gruelling, the team feel fitter than ever. It is surely no coincidence Fulham have scored 21 times in the last 10 minutes of matches. </p> <p>No coincidence either that Tigana is so fitness obsessed. \"In all the running we did he was always at the front,\" says his former Marseille team-mate Chris Waddle. </p> <p><strong> Diet</strong><br> </p> <p> Whether Tigana has spies in every west London fast-food outlet is uncertain, but with body fat and weight tests every month or so, his players know they cannot afford to mess around. </p> <p>Nutritional education at Fulham has included not only what to eat and drink but when. If alcohol is out, water and carbohydrates are definitely in, with food to be consumed within an hour of the end of training so the body can absorb more energy from it. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, plenty of pasta, potatoes and rice can be found in the training ground canteen, and breakfast - cereals and toast rather than hash browns - is laid on for those who want it. </p> <p>The importance of rehydrating and refuelling (not in the Gazza sense) before, during and after training has been clearly stressed. Water is taken before training and at 15- or 20-minute intervals throughout; Lucozade is saved for after to avoid blood sugar levels rising and dropping suddenly mid-session. </p> <p>\"The players take more care than they did in the past and because of that they are better players,\" says Alex Court, the first-team exercise physiologist. \"Their injury levels have reduced, they have more energy and have reduced their body-fat levels, so they are leaner and more athletic.\" </p> <p>Tests are carried out regularly. Body-fat levels are expected to be around 7-8% (some have fallen 4% from last season) and blood is taken every six weeks or so. </p> <p>\"From the blood tests you can see levels of fatigue,\" Court explains, \"and the doctor will look and see if they are too fatigued or if they need more work, and increase or reduce training accordingly.\" </p> <p>Drinking, naturally, is discouraged, though Tigana was not averse to a tipple in his playing days. \"He wasn't on it every day,\" says Waddle, \"but I can guarantee after a game we used to sit at the back of the plane and have two or three beers.\" </p> <p><strong> Technique</strong><br> </p> <p> \"It's plain to see,\" Kean says, \"that at first-team level everyone has improved to a man.\" Given the amount of time which is devoted to ball-work that is hardly a shock. The technical improvement is a tribute not just to Tigana but to the coach Christian Damiano, who spent many years at the French National Academy at Clairefontaine and has been chief scout and assistant coach of France. </p> <p>Damiano devises and oversees the routines required by Tigana, who frequently takes part in them. Almost every aspect of training involves a ball. \"Players will have probably 2,500 to 3,000 touches of the ball per session,\" Kean says. \"If you analyse other clubs' training they might not have so many. There's a lot of repetitive work with the ball and very few times will you see Jean Tigana stop a session. But when he does it's a very powerful message.\" </p> <p>Significantly, the main exercises have not just technical but tactical importance. \"We do not do exercises for the sake of exercises,\" Damiano says. \"It is always so it can be transferred into a game.\" The idea is to build understandings and passing patterns which become instinct. Players work in their natural positions. </p> <p>\"If you are [Steve] Finnan and you play right-back, you work in the session in your zone, building a relationship perhaps with [Andy] Melville, Sean Davis and Bjarne Goldbaek. They build options to play together and when you work like this in training by the time you come to games it is natural. And if you want that you must repeat, repeat and repeat again.\" </p> <p>Tigana's quick grasp of English has helped him settle but his success runs deeper. \"Jean has gained the trust of every player,\" Kean says. \"Even the guys who are not in the team are happy because they can look in the mirror and say they are better footballers.\" </p> <p><strong> Tactics</strong><br> </p> <p> Movement, patience and passing form such an integral part of Fulham's approach that dribbling sounds frowned upon. \"Don't run with the ball,\" Damiano says. \"Perhaps when you are 20 metres from goal and you have a chance to score.

      "bodyText": "Fitness If Fulham's players were unsure whether their new manager Jean Tigana was more Butlins or Barlinnie, they found out soon enough. Hauled in two weeks early from their summer break, they were quickly carted off to France for pre-season training which included 6.30 wake-up calls, dawn starts and up to three sessions a day. The tone was set. The Frenchman arrives for work at Fulham's Motspur Park training ground at 7.30 each morning and although the players pitch up rather later, two sessions a day remain common. Not that the idea is to run people into the ground. \"The intensity level of training is controlled so the players are peaking for each game,\" says Steve Kean, the youth academy director who has been working closely with Tigana and his coaches.

      "body": "<p>The FA Cup is dead, long live the FA Cup. If ever there was a chance for football's oldest competition to be revived by a spot of shock therapy it is surely this weekend. </p> <p>Last season's competition was stunned by the withdrawal of Manchester United to compete in the Fifa world club championship, which clashed with the fourth round, and did not fully regain consciousness. </p> <p>The Cup meandered on myopically, producing such moments of passing interest as Leicester City's removal of Arsenal on penalties after 3 goalless hours and the hat-trick by Aston Villa's Benito Carbone which did for Leeds United. But an anodyne final between Chelsea and Villa still left the game wondering if the tournament had any life left in it. </p> <p>This weekend's third-round ties will surely prove the pessimists wrong. For the next three years the road to Wembley may carry diversion signs to the Millennium stadium in Cardiff but this is the FA Cup's opportunity to demonstrate that the essential spirit of the exercise remains strong. </p> <p>Manchester United's decision to book accommodation in Cardiff during the second week in May is not just a sign of self-confidence; it is also a gesture of intent. If United's mood has been read correctly, Sir Alex Ferguson still regards the Cup as an important accessory, a chalice to the Champions League grail and the Premiership goblet. </p> <p>Tomorrow's tie at Craven Cottage will, therefore, be about something more than an attempt by Fulham, the runaway leaders of the Nationwide League First Division, to unsaddle the thoroughbreds who are again leaving the rest behind in the Premiership. For here are two teams, outstanding at their respective levels, who can set the tone for the rest of the Cup this season by providing a match of distinction. </p> <p>With Jean Tigana, the Fulham manager, as devoted to a quick, accurate, imaginative passing style as Ferguson, it is difficult to believe that the game will fail as a spectacle. And, if Ferguson decides to bring the full attacking force of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Paul Scholes into the action from the start, so much the better. Teddy Sheringham, newly recovered from injury, is expected to be on the bench. </p> <p>For Fulham, losing Chris Coleman, their most influential defender, after a car accident this week is a blow which may prove too much of a handicap to bear. But two seasons ago United beat them only 1-0 at Old Trafford on the way to winning the Cup for the 10th time and, if all else fails, older Cottagers will always have memories of 1958 to sustain them. </p> <p>Then, too, Fulham were knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United but only in a semi-final replay at Highbury which they lost 5-3 after drawing 2-2 at Villa Park. United, of course, were fielding the side cobbled together in the wake of the Munich air crash while Fulham's attack included Johnny Haynes and Jimmy Hill, who scored six goals in the Cup that season. </p> <p>Forty-three years ago the FA Cup became a symbol of Old Trafford's determination to recreate the qualities which had perished with the Busby Babes. Now another tie against Fulham should mark Old Trafford's pledge to re-embrace the competition ignored last sea son as a matter of convenience. </p> <p>Yet for the Cup properly to regain its previous status something more than a renewal of interest by Manchester United is required. This afternoon those contesting the other two Champions League places in the Premiership, most notably Arsenal and Liverpool, need to demonstrate by their actions that the Millennium stadium in May holds as much attraction as Wembley ever did. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger may have Tony Adams restored to his defence for the tie at Carlisle but will the Arsenal manager be thinking of fielding a below-strength side against the Third Division's bottom team? And to what extent will G\u00e9rard Houllier regard the visit of Rotherham to Anfield as a serious business? As it is, Emile Heskey, Gary McAllister and Markus Babbel may be unfit. </p> <p>Sunderland and Ipswich, third and fourth in the Premiership and closing on Arsenal, may take a stronger interest in the Cup this time. While a Champions League place would be the biggest reward for both clubs, neither will shrug aside the FA Cup and Sunderland have particular reason for seeing off Crystal Palace, who have already knocked them out of the Worthington Cup. </p> <p>Ipswich, on the other hand, could still be one of the first of the Millennium stadium's English finalists; on Tuesday they open their Worthington Cup semi-final against Birmingham at Portman Road. In the meantime George Burley's side visit Morecambe for one of several ties which represent the true soul of the FA Cup at this stage. </p> <p>For all its offhand treatment by some of the big clubs, the competition still means a great deal to the small fry in terms of finance and prestige. Last season Rushden and Diamonds took Sheffield United to a third-round replay before going out on penalties, while the season before they lost 3-1 at Elland Road after holding Leeds to 0-0. </p> <p>So who will take up the baton this time? Probably not Morecambe, given the excellence of Ipswich's passing game, or Dagenham and Redbridge, considering Charlton's home form. A better bet could be Kingstonian, who face Southend United of the Third Division having already beaten Brentford of the Second. Or maybe Yeovil, those giantkillers of old, will surprise Bolton. </p> <p>The Premiership sides most in danger of embarrassment would appear to be Tottenham, who make the short journey to Leyton Orient, and Everton, who visit Watford in a reprise of the 1984 final. Then again Leeds, lions in Europe but lost lambs domestically, may be surprised by Barnsley, whose away record is bad enough to satisfy the delicious illogicality on which the FA Cup has always thrived. </p> <p><strong> David Lacey's guide to the pick of the ties</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Carlisle Utd v Arsenal</strong><br> </p> <p> Before 1992 'Walsall' was written on Arsenal hearts in the FA Cup. Then that giantkilling act of 1933 was surpassed by Wrexham, who beat George Graham's team 2-1 at the Racecourse. The Welsh side were last in the league in 1990-91, so comparisons with today's tie at Brunton Park are inevitable. Carlisle are in last place by some distance, Arsenal's away form is poor and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has more injury problems than usual. A replay is possible but to win Carlisle need to reach heights previously unscaled. </p> <p><strong> Scorecast: Carlisle 1 Arsenal 3</strong> </p> <p><strong> Morecambe v Ipswich Town</strong><br> </p> <p> While the spirit of Eric Morecambe will be supporting Luton Town in the Cup today presumably his statue on Morecambe's promenade will allow itself a silent giggle should Ipswich be beaten. This is unlikely since George Burley's side are winning regularly away from home and are already in sight of the Worthington Cup final. Morecambe's best chance would appear to be to turn this afternoon's tie into the sort of scrap Ipswich might not relish with their Worthington semi-final with Birmingham City only 72 hours away. </p> <p><strong> Morecambe 0 Ipswich 3</strong> </p> <p><strong> Leyton Orient v Tottenham</strong><br> </p> <p> Should Tottenham perform as ineptly as they did at Ipswich last Saturday the only surprise will be if Orient fail to win today's game. As it is, the Brisbane Road club are omnipotent at home this season, unbeaten with 20 goals scored and only nine conceded. Spurs' confidence drains away when they are on the road. An early goal for Orient and another black mood will surely descend on George Graham's team. This tie, then, could see the upset of the weekend - and Orient did knock out Chelsea on their way to the semi-finals in 1978. </p> <p><strong> Orient 1 Tottenham 0</strong> </p> <p><strong> Charlton Athletic v Dagenham</strong><br> </p> <p> No one at the Valley will complain if this afternoon's tie produces the extravaganza of D&amp;R's first-round tie with Leyton Orient eight years ago, which the O's eventually won 5-4. Dagenham's biggest FA Cup triumph was a first-round victory over Cambridge United, then in the Fourth Division, in 1985, but a share of the gate receipts is likely to be their only reward today. As their victory over Arsenal showed, Charlton have become hard to beat at home and Alan Curbishley's players should wrap this one up long before the finish. </p> <p><strong> Charlton 6 Dagenham 1</strong> </p> <p><strong> Fulham v Manchester Utd</strong><br> </p> <p> Far from regarding the FA Cup as an impediment to their promotion ambitions Fulham have tended to use it as a touchstone for what they hope to achieve in the Premiership. Two years ago they went out narrowly to United, Andy Cole scoring the only goal at Old Trafford. Cole will not be around tomorrow but whatever side Sir Alex Ferguson puts out will surely be tested by a quick-passing pattern of play which mirrors their own. Ferguson hates replays but may have to put up with one if the opposition are on song. </p> <p><strong> Fulham 1 Man Utd 2</strong></p>",

Ipswich, on the other hand, could still be one of the first of the Millennium stadium's English finalists; on Tuesday they open their Worthington Cup semi-final against Birmingham at Portman Road. In the meantime George Burley's side visit Morecambe for one of several ties which represent the true soul of the FA Cup at this stage. For all its offhand treatment by some of the big clubs, the competition still means a great deal to the small fry in terms of finance and prestige. Last season Rushden and Diamonds took Sheffield United to a third-round replay before going out on penalties, while the season before they lost 3-1 at Elland Road after holding Leeds to 0-0. So who will take up the baton this time? Probably not Morecambe, given the excellence of Ipswich's passing game, or Dagenham and Redbridge, considering Charlton's home form. A better bet could be Kingstonian, who face Southend United of the Third Division having already beaten Brentford of the Second. Or maybe Yeovil, those giantkillers of old, will surprise Bolton. The Premiership sides most in danger of embarrassment would appear to be Tottenham, who make the short journey to Leyton Orient, and Everton, who visit Watford in a reprise of the 1984 final. Then again Leeds, lions in Europe but lost lambs domestically, may be surprised by Barnsley, whose away record is bad enough to satisfy the delicious illogicality on which the FA Cup has always thrived. David Lacey's guide to the pick of the ties Carlisle Utd v Arsenal Before 1992 'Walsall' was written on Arsenal hearts in the FA Cup. Then that giantkilling act of 1933 was surpassed by Wrexham, who beat George Graham's team 2-1 at the Racecourse. The Welsh side were last in the league in 1990-91, so comparisons with today's tie at Brunton Park are inevitable. Carlisle are in last place by some distance, Arsenal's away form is poor and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has more injury problems than usual. A replay is possible but to win Carlisle need to reach heights previously unscaled. Scorecast: Carlisle 1 Arsenal 3 Morecambe v Ipswich Town While the spirit of Eric Morecambe will be supporting Luton Town in the Cup today presumably his statue on Morecambe's promenade will allow itself a silent giggle should Ipswich be beaten. This is unlikely since George Burley's side are winning regularly away from home and are already in sight of the Worthington Cup final. Morecambe's best chance would appear to be to turn this afternoon's tie into the sort of scrap Ipswich might not relish with their Worthington semi-final with Birmingham City only 72 hours away. Morecambe 0 Ipswich 3 Leyton Orient v Tottenham Should Tottenham perform as ineptly as they did at Ipswich last Saturday the only surprise will be if Orient fail to win today's game. As it is, the Brisbane Road club are omnipotent at home this season, unbeaten with 20 goals scored and only nine conceded. Spurs' confidence drains away when they are on the road. An early goal for Orient and another black mood will surely descend on George Graham's team. This tie, then, could see the upset of the weekend - and Orient did knock out Chelsea on their way to the semi-finals in 1978. Orient 1 Tottenham 0 Charlton Athletic v Dagenham No one at the Valley will complain if this afternoon's tie produces the extravaganza of D&amp;R's first-round tie with Leyton Orient eight years ago, which the O's eventually won 5-4. Dagenham's biggest FA Cup triumph was a first-round victory over Cambridge United, then in the Fourth Division, in 1985, but a share of the gate receipts is likely to be their only reward today. As their victory over Arsenal showed, Charlton have become hard to beat at home and Alan Curbishley's players should wrap this one up long before the finish. Charlton 6 Dagenham 1 Fulham v Manchester Utd Far from regarding the FA Cup as an impediment to their promotion ambitions Fulham have tended to use it as a touchstone for what they hope to achieve in the Premiership. Two years ago they went out narrowly to United, Andy Cole scoring the only goal at Old Trafford. Cole will not be around tomorrow but whatever side Sir Alex Ferguson puts out will surely be tested by a quick-passing pattern of play which mirrors their own. Ferguson hates replays but may have to put up with one if the opposition are on song. Fulham 1 Man Utd 2",

The memory may be painful for Manchester City supporters but, 20 years on, the mazy dribble and dreamy finish with which Villa won the Cup for Spurs is still fresh in the mind. </p> <p>Certainly no one at White Hart Lane has forgotten. Villa marked his first trip to England for five years by walking on to the pitch when Newcastle visited last Tuesday and the reception made his knees, never mind Ossie Ardiles's, go all trembly. \"Twenty years ago I scored a goal and everyone remembers me,\" he says. \"It's unbelievable.\" </p> <p>One might expect Villa to be tired of reliving that goal. His life, after all, has moved on to coaching in Argentina and in June he hopes to team up with Ardiles once more in Japan. Yet mere mention of the game lights up his face, instantly recognisable even if the beard is greyer and the hair thinner. At his ranch back home the video must be wearing out. </p> <p>\"It is my son,\" he stresses. \"For every friend who comes into my house he puts on the video and says: 'You see, this is my father who scored that goal at Wembley in the FA Cup final.' I don't do it often because I feel embarrassed and I know in my memory what I did. I don't need to watch it as a reminder.\" </p> <p>He must have seen his magic on Tuesday as it flashed on the big screens at Spurs, as before every match. To the right Steve Archibald is unmarked in front of goal, yet Villa goes on, past one, two, three defenders before slipping the ball under Joe Corrigan. </p> <p>\"I didn't realise that goal was superb at the moment I scored,\" he says. \"In Argentina we try all the time to do something special and very often it does not come off. I tried at Wembley and it came off.\" He points at his chest and laughs: \"This is a lucky boy.\" </p> <p>Even in his homeland he is remembered for it. \"Wembley is the house of football,\" he explains. \"Everyone in Argentina says: 'You scored a goal at Wembley.' I believe I have scored better goals but that was the right goal in the right place at the right time.\" </p> <p>A better goal is hard to imagine but Villa proceeds to demonstrate. It was against Norwich, he says, zig-zagging his hand before flashing it towards the ceiling. \"I cut and cut and cut again,\" he says, \"and shot into the top of the goal.\" Another broad smile. </p> <p>What tends to be forgotten about Villa is not only that he scored earlier in the replay against City but that he was substituted in the first match. Spurs were 1-0 down and he traipsed off devastated, thinking the game was lost and his chance of glory gone. </p> <p>\"I walked around the pitch thinking fuck Keith Burkinshaw,\" he later revealed. But Spurs salvaged a replay, Burkinshaw gave him another chance and Villa made amends as he had promised himself he would. </p> <p>Such reminiscences must have filled the air at Ardiles's London home this week, where Villa stayed until his friend returned to Japan where he coaches Yokohama Marinos. Perhaps they recalled their home debuts in 1978, when an Argentine flag flew at White Hart Lane and the fans gave them a ticker-tape welcome. </p> <p>\"We talk all the time about the old years,\" Villa says, \"sometimes about the difficult time we had at first.

Then, with Villa, Ardiles and Glenn Hoddle in midfield, Tottenham oozed fantasy. \"The style was different,\" he says, \"but it is not just Spurs who have lost that quality.

      "body": "<p>Have you completed your tax return for the year to April 2000? The Inland Revenue says that over 3m forms are still outstanding, and threatens a \u00a3100 fine if you don't file by the end of this month. </p> <p>Tax returns are issued to just over 9m people - or one-third of all taxpayers - typically those who are self-employed, company directors and higher paid employees, and other people with untaxed income such as rents from property. </p> <p>If your return is still in its pristine blue wrapper, you had better open it, gather your financial records, and get to work. If you need help in wading through the form, you may phone your tax office, or the Revenue's helpline at evenings and weekends (0845 9000 444). And as you may also need to ask for extra pages - see page 2 of the form - you should not delay. </p> <p>Some people put off filing because they do not have all the information needed. If you are unsure of the income received from your bank or building society, you may ask them for a certificate of interest paid to you. They must provide this free of charge. </p> <p>If you had a salary or occupational pension, income and tax details should be on your P60 or P45, with taxable benefits-in-kind reported on form P11D. If you have mislaid these, your employer or pension administrator should hold the relevant details (although they will not normally offer duplicate certificates). If they won't offer you the information you need for your return, it may help to know that they should have reported it directly to the Revenue last summer and your tax office may agree to give it to you. </p> <p>Sometimes it is impossible to obtain exact figures before the deadline. For example you may not have kept records of some trading income or expenses, or you may be awaiting details of income from a trust or deceased estate which has not completed its accounts. The Revenue says you should not allow such difficulties to delay the return and that you should use an 'estimate' or 'provisional figure', explained on page 27 of the Tax Return Guide. </p> <p>The most important distinction between these two terms is that if you enter a provisional figure you will need to submit further information within a specified period. </p> <p>If your form was issued to you on or before October 31, 2000 you must file by January 31. Normally you should post it to your own tax office but, if you are running late, you could take it by hand to any local office. Defaulters are threatened with a \u00a3100 fine but, due to a flaw in the legislation, no charge can be made if the form is received by the Revenue on February 1, or found in a tax office letter box at 7am on the following morning. If the form was issued after 1 November, you may file up to 3 months after the date of issue shown on the front page. </p> <p>Whatever date you send it, it is vital that you take a photocopy of the return. This provides some evidence that you have filed, and will also help you to check the Revenue's figures. </p> <p>Although self assessment was introduced four years ago, there is still confusion over the obligation to calculate your tax.

      "bodyText": "Have you completed your tax return for the year to April 2000? The Inland Revenue says that over 3m forms are still outstanding, and threatens a \u00a3100 fine if you don't file by the end of this month. Tax returns are issued to just over 9m people - or one-third of all taxpayers - typically those who are self-employed, company directors and higher paid employees, and other people with untaxed income such as rents from property. If your return is still in its pristine blue wrapper, you had better open it, gather your financial records, and get to work. If you need help in wading through the form, you may phone your tax office, or the Revenue's helpline at evenings and weekends (0845 9000 444). And as you may also need to ask for extra pages - see page 2 of the form - you should not delay. Some people put off filing because they do not have all the information needed. If you are unsure of the income received from your bank or building society, you may ask them for a certificate of interest paid to you. They must provide this free of charge. If you had a salary or occupational pension, income and tax details should be on your P60 or P45, with taxable benefits-in-kind reported on form P11D. If you have mislaid these, your employer or pension administrator should hold the relevant details (although they will not normally offer duplicate certificates). If they won't offer you the information you need for your return, it may help to know that they should have reported it directly to the Revenue last summer and your tax office may agree to give it to you. Sometimes it is impossible to obtain exact figures before the deadline. For example you may not have kept records of some trading income or expenses, or you may be awaiting details of income from a trust or deceased estate which has not completed its accounts. The Revenue says you should not allow such difficulties to delay the return and that you should use an 'estimate' or 'provisional figure', explained on page 27 of the Tax Return Guide. The most important distinction between these two terms is that if you enter a provisional figure you will need to submit further information within a specified period. If your form was issued to you on or before October 31, 2000 you must file by January 31. Normally you should post it to your own tax office but, if you are running late, you could take it by hand to any local office. Defaulters are threatened with a \u00a3100 fine but, due to a flaw in the legislation, no charge can be made if the form is received by the Revenue on February 1, or found in a tax office letter box at 7am on the following morning. If the form was issued after 1 November, you may file up to 3 months after the date of issue shown on the front page. Whatever date you send it, it is vital that you take a photocopy of the return. This provides some evidence that you have filed, and will also help you to check the Revenue's figures. Although self assessment was introduced four years ago, there is still confusion over the obligation to calculate your tax. The Revenue promised to do this in good time if you filed by September 30, giving the impression that people filing now must calculate their tax for themselves. This is not true; the taxman will do the sums whenever you send in the form, although it may take a few months. So if you believe that you still owe some tax for 1999/2000, which will fall due on January 31, you may want to make an estimated payment this month to avoid interest (as well as the 5 percent surcharge added to tax paid after 28 February).

Last year, it raised \u00a3154m from sales. And now it is expected to bank a further \u00a3100m from disposals. At 366p per share, the company is valued at \u00a31.25bn. </p> <p> <strong> BAE Systems:</strong> The hope is for a strong recovery backed by military contracts for the Hawk and Eurofighter aircraft plus benefits from acquisitions. The \u00a337bn order book offers solid backing. BAE is worth \u00a311.5bn at 382p a share. </p> <p> <strong> Berkeley Group:</strong> A housebuilder whose ability to grow margins impresses. It scores on urban development skills as well as the low acquisition costs of its landbank. At 755p, Berkeley is valued at \u00a3960m. </p> <p> <strong> BG Group: </strong> Now focusing on gas exploration and production, there are high hopes of big gas field finds in Egypt and the Caspian Sea. It is one of the purest gas plays. At 262p, BG is worth \u00a39.2bn. </p> <p> <strong> Cobham: </strong> Designs and manufactures specialist systems and components for the aerospace and defence industries where the outlook looks firmer than many other areas. A \u00a31.3bn order book inspires confidence. And brokers expect 15% profits growth a year. It has a \u00a31bn value at 1046p per share. </p> <p> <strong> GlaxoSmithKline:</strong> A triple barrelled world leader in pharmaceuticals with huge research and marketing muscle. Fans expect to see replacements for Zantac - now off patent - as well as cost savings and 15% annual growth. It's worth \u00a3117bn at 1892p. </p> <p> <strong> Marconi: </strong> Poor trading results from competitors and the wash from the tech share meltdown have short circuited confidence. But it has transformed itself from a defence industry conglomerate to a company with products ranging from home appliances and satellite communication to medical imaging. At 719p per share, Marconi is worth \u00a320bn. </p> <p> <strong> Mitie:</strong> Supplies skilled and unskilled labour through 65 subsidiaries and has notched up 30% annual growth with more to come. Management is highly motivated through shares. At 380p, the group is worth \u00a3530m. </p> <p> <strong> Royal Bank of Scotland:</strong> Owns NatWest so this tip has to be cleared by lawyers. Cost savings and revenue growth in a sector wracked by competition should bolster earnings increases. At 1582p, the UK's most valuable domestic bank is worth \u00a342.3bn. </p> <p> <strong> Vodafone:</strong> With a \u00a3150bn market value at 245p per share, the mobile phone operator is the UK's biggest firm. It had a poor 2000 but has little debt compared with rival phone firms and could easily afford to snap up assets from cash-strapped competitors. </p> <p>But what happened to NatWest's stock picks for 2000? Only one, investment trust 3i, which specialises in venture capital, ended up in positive territory with Dixons picking up the wooden spoon thanks to a slump in value at former subsidiary Freeserve. </p> <p>But investors who bought all the stocks and sold in March 2000 would have made huge profits. The problem was NatWest went heavily into technology but thought it had avoided difficulties by opting for companies with a proven business model and a real customer base rather than dot.coms which had neither.</p>",

It scores on urban development skills as well as the low acquisition costs of its landbank. At 755p, Berkeley is valued at \u00a3960m. BG Group: Now focusing on gas exploration and production, there are high hopes of big gas field finds in Egypt and the Caspian Sea. It is one of the purest gas plays. At 262p, BG is worth \u00a39.2bn. Cobham: Designs and manufactures specialist systems and components for the aerospace and defence industries where the outlook looks firmer than many other areas. A \u00a31.3bn order book inspires confidence. And brokers expect 15% profits growth a year. It has a \u00a31bn value at 1046p per share. GlaxoSmithKline: A triple barrelled world leader in pharmaceuticals with huge research and marketing muscle. Fans expect to see replacements for Zantac - now off patent - as well as cost savings and 15% annual growth. It's worth \u00a3117bn at 1892p. Marconi: Poor trading results from competitors and the wash from the tech share meltdown have short circuited confidence. But it has transformed itself from a defence industry conglomerate to a company with products ranging from home appliances and satellite communication to medical imaging. At 719p per share, Marconi is worth \u00a320bn. Mitie: Supplies skilled and unskilled labour through 65 subsidiaries and has notched up 30% annual growth with more to come. Management is highly motivated through shares. At 380p, the group is worth \u00a3530m. Royal Bank of Scotland: Owns NatWest so this tip has to be cleared by lawyers. Cost savings and revenue growth in a sector wracked by competition should bolster earnings increases. At 1582p, the UK's most valuable domestic bank is worth \u00a342.3bn. Vodafone: With a \u00a3150bn market value at 245p per share, the mobile phone operator is the UK's biggest firm. It had a poor 2000 but has little debt compared with rival phone firms and could easily afford to snap up assets from cash-strapped competitors. But what happened to NatWest's stock picks for 2000? Only one, investment trust 3i, which specialises in venture capital, ended up in positive territory with Dixons picking up the wooden spoon thanks to a slump in value at former subsidiary Freeserve. But investors who bought all the stocks and sold in March 2000 would have made huge profits. The problem was NatWest went heavily into technology but thought it had avoided difficulties by opting for companies with a proven business model and a real customer base rather than dot.coms which had neither.",

Secondly, ask your old bank for a Tessa maturity certificate, then go to the bank or building society where you want to open a new Tessa-only Isa. Remember, they may want extensive identification because of anti-money laundering regulations. But the message from the experts is not to rush in just yet, as banks and building societies will begin to re-jig their savings account rates over the next couple of months to attract savers with maturing Tessa funds. \u0095 For further information on the Chase de Vere Tessa league table and a guide to maturing Tessas, call its Moneyline team on 0845 609 2001.",
