Soon, she is having an affair with her boss, a man whose car is worth more than the Paddington flat she rents, and trying to make sense of the past.

Teenage Lizzie leaves home in Devon without a word to her mother and takes an office job in London. Soon, she is having an affair with her boss, a man whose car is worth more than the Paddington flat she rents, and trying to make sense of the past. Her father, a famous artist now in eclipse, left home when she was tiny, a fact which seems to explain her vulnerability to a lover who is anything but dependable.

The obvious answer must be that the decades of the First and Second World Wars tie for first place: the Somme, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb and unprecedented loss of life. But at least the outcomes of these great conflicts were clear and, from the British perspective, the right side won on both occasions. </p> <p>The Thirties were very different, Piers Brendon suggests, in The Dark Valley, a lively, fascinating but compulsively gloomy book. It may have been the decade of vintage P.G. Wodehouse, classic No\u00ebl Coward and of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing cheek to cheek. But sandwiched as it was between the great crash of 1929 and the renewal of hostilities 10 years later, the Thirties witnessed what Churchill called 'the long, dismal, drawling tides of drift and surrender', and Britain's part in these international affairs was neither decisive nor glorious. </p> <p>Of course, and as Brendon takes pains to point out, the previous 15 years had scarcely been a bed of roses. The First World War had left Europe materially, politically and spiritually impoverished, as the old landmarks and certainties had dissolved in the trenches, as Germany was left embittered and resentful at the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and as the politicians and the public in Britain and France vowed that they would go to any lengths to avoid such carnage again. </p> <p>Add to this the advent of Bolshevism in Russia, fascism in Italy, inflation in Germany and isolationism in the United States and the prospects did not look exactly alluring. Then came the collapse of the American stock market, which ushered in the greatest economic crisis the world had ever seen, and wrecked whatever lingering hopes there might be that the planet had been made safe for democracy. </p> <p>In many countries in Europe and elsewhere, the scales of economic devastation and human misery were such that it seemed clear democracy could not cope and should therefore be dispensed with. In Italy, Mussolini strengthened his position by reaching a concordat with the Pope. In Germany, Hitler seized power from the ageing President Hindenburg. In Japan, the military machine became increasingly uncontrollable by the government or the emperor. In Spain, General Franco overthrew the Republic. </p> <p>The resulting authoritarian regimes sought distraction from domestic difficulties by staging extravagant foreign adventures: the Japanese invaded Manchuria, Mussolini annexed Ethiopia and Albania, while Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland, seized Austria and eviscerated Czechoslovakia. And these acts of aggression went unchecked because the powers which might have stopped them had (or made) problems of their own. </p> <p>Of course, the depression which brought Hitler to power in Germany also brought Roosevelt to power in the United States. But FDR was too concerned with implementing the New Deal and in not offending isolationist opinion at home to do anything about the deteriorating state of Europe. </p> <p>In Russia, Stalin was preoccupied by collectivisation (which ruined Soviet agriculture) and by purging the high command of the army (which gravely weakened his country's power to defend itself). In France, the Third Republic degenerated into chaotic irresolution: the Maginot Line was an expensive white elephant, the Popular Front achieved nothing, and no one was willing to contemplate the prospect of another war. </p> <p>As for Britain, the economy was weak, the Empire was overextended and the idea of waging war simultaneously in Europe and Asia was almost too terrible to contemplate. </p> <p>Under these circumstances, where no nation seemed willing or able to stand firm against the Axis powers, the policy of appeasement made extremely good sense, provided that you did not live in Austria, Ethiopia or Manchuria, and provided that the fascist leaders could be trusted. But could they? Baldwin was too lethargic to worry about this, and Neville Chamberlain was convinced, almost to the end, that they could. </p> <p>In this, Chamberlain was terribly mistaken. Evil and amoral, living in fantasy worlds of their own creation, and buoyed up by their carefully-orchestrated cults of personality, neither Hitler nor Mussolini (nor, come to that, Stalin) were people to go tiger-shooting with, let alone to be trusted with the fates of nations and peoples. By the end of the decade, things were thus so bad that many Britons, who had previously opposed another war, now saw it as the only hope and the only solution. </p> <p>In telling his tale of the Thirties, Brendon paints a vivid and vigorous canvas. He follows the (in)action back and forth from London to Berlin to Washington to Tokyo in an assured manner reminiscent of a Frederick Forsyth novel. His character sketches of the principal players are sharp, perceptive and often very funny. In a world which was increasingly spinning out of control, he finds few, if any, heroes. </p> <p>We are often told that the politicians of yesteryear were greater figures than the politicians of today. This book provides an unanswerable riposte to such nostalgic nonsense. As a result, The Dark Valley is not an uplifting account. On the contrary, it is almost invariably depressing. But the book should be read by anyone who wants to understand the terrible harm that world recession, allied with fanatical ideology in some quarters, and feeble leadership in others, did then - and could yet do again.</p>",

His latest, Babylon, sold more than 200,000 copies on publication last year. Among the post-Soviet generation of readers, he has both a popular following and intense critical attention as a serious writer. </p> <p><strong> Observer:</strong> In Russian, your new novel, Babylon, is called Generation P. What is Generation P? </p> <p><strong> Viktor Pelevin:</strong> There are so many meanings. First, it's Generation X. Second, it's connected with this Russian term that was used in the end of the book. It's an obscene Russian term, pizdets, a really rude word. So it's Generation Pizdets, which means a generation that faces catastrophe. And now, you know, some of our newspapers think that this is Generation Putin. So it's like whatever you like. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> In Russia, you have the popularity of a film star. </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> A film star who is never seen. I do my best to avoid the limelight. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What is the reason for your celebrity ? </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> Well, I don't know. People just like my books. I'm not a public person. I never appear on television and never give interviews. Well, sometimes I do, but it's not a normal thing. I really don't know. I'm just trying to write good books. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> When did you first start to write? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> When I was in my late twenties. First, I had another education. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> As? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> An engineer in electronics. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> In the Soviet era, being a writer meant being a real scoundrel. People like Solzhenitsyn were actually fighting the system. I never was a hero. I would never be able to do that. So I'm not really sure that I would have been writing if the Soviet Union had not collapsed. Perhaps I would be writing something, but I would never try to publish it. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Your emergence as a writer coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Your work seems to be an exploration of that. </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> I think you're right - post-Soviet Russia. But I'm not interested in the Soviet past. There are so many writers who are still doing that. That's pretty understandable. For people of the older generation, who lived their entire conscious life under Soviet power, it still remains the only thing they still can think about. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Are there earlier Russian writers who influenced you? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> There were so many. I guess every writer that I have ever read. When I was about seven or eight years old, I started to read Chekhov's funny stories. You know, he started as a writer by writing short, funny stories for magazines in Moscow and St Petersburg. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Do you have a belief in the purpose of fiction? </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> No. I think if you're a writer you'd rather not think about general issues. If you are not creative, you could have thoughts like that, but if you're a writer they won't help you. The more general ideas you have, the worse it is for what you write. I'm not into the theory of literature. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You're also a Buddhist? </p> <p> <strong> VP:</strong> I'm a student. I practise and quite often I go to the Zen retreats. The last one, in South Korea, lasted for three months last winter. It was the finest way to enter the millennium. For the entire time, you are given only rice and seaweed; for the New Year party, we were given a slice of pizza and a can of Coke. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> How would you judge the Russian literary scene at the moment? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> I really don't consider myself a part of the literary scene. It's something that is really harmful for a writer to establish and maintain any contact with the so-called literary scene. </p> <p>A literary scene is something that never produces literature. It only produces the so-called literary life, which has nothing to do with books. If you want to write books, you've got to keep as far from it as you can. So I never mix in literary circles. I don't spend my time talking with other writers. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What are you working on now? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> I'm writing short stories and considering my next novel. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What do you feel about your new President? </p> <p> <strong> VP: </strong> My new President? Actually, the funny thing about it was that I found out that Russia's having a new leader two months after you did, because I was in Korea. We didn't have any link with the outside world. Even talking is prohibited in that retreat. You don't talk; you write notes. So I didn't know anything about it. I don't think much about Mr Putin. </p> <p>The only thing I can tell you is that I think he was elected for two reasons. First, because he's a very fresh face for the average Russian. Though he was KGB director, he wasn't in the media. He was in the shadows. If you live in Russia, after a while you start to perceive all active politicians as members of the same gang of crooks, like some rabble on the station. </p> <p>In Russia, it happens there are crooks who are playing cards. Some people play with them and they pretend that they lose. Some people pretend that they win. But actually, they're in the same game; they're just cheating people; they're trying to make you play. You'll never win. So I think all our politicians, whether they are communists, the so-called liberal democrats, the so-called Right, they're all perceived as members of the same company of crooks. But Putin was something fresh, something new. That was one reason.</p> <p>The second is that he's a very good communicator, Russian-style. He really can make it. He has this instant access to your attention. I think it's just his natural leadership. Russians perceive Putin pretty much like Americans perceived Reagan. </p> <p>And then perhaps this Chechen war helped. He was very belligerent and many Russians took a view that maybe he solved that problem. Actually, you know, I invented a good term about the Russian society to come. I love it. It's called dot.communism.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Viktor Pelevin was born in 1962. He is the author of several acclaimed novels, including Omon Ra, The Life of Insects and The Clay Machine Gun. His latest, Babylon, sold more than 200,000 copies on publication last year. Among the post-Soviet generation of readers, he has both a popular following and intense critical attention as a serious writer. Observer: In Russian, your new novel, Babylon, is called Generation P. What is Generation P? Viktor Pelevin: There are so many meanings. First, it's Generation X. Second, it's connected with this Russian term that was used in the end of the book. It's an obscene Russian term, pizdets, a really rude word. So it's Generation Pizdets, which means a generation that faces catastrophe. And now, you know, some of our newspapers think that this is Generation Putin. So it's like whatever you like. Obs: In Russia, you have the popularity of a film star. VP: A film star who is never seen. I do my best to avoid the limelight. Obs: What is the reason for your celebrity ? VP: Well, I don't know. People just like my books. I'm not a public person. I never appear on television and never give interviews. Well, sometimes I do, but it's not a normal thing. I really don't know. I'm just trying to write good books. Obs: When did you first start to write? VP: When I was in my late twenties. First, I had another education. Obs: As? VP: An engineer in electronics. Obs: Did you always want to be a writer? VP: In the Soviet era, being a writer meant being a real scoundrel. People like Solzhenitsyn were actually fighting the system. I never was a hero. I would never be able to do that. So I'm not really sure that I would have been writing if the Soviet Union had not collapsed. Perhaps I would be writing something, but I would never try to publish it. Obs: Your emergence as a writer coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Your work seems to be an exploration of that. VP: I think you're right - post-Soviet Russia. But I'm not interested in the Soviet past. There are so many writers who are still doing that. That's pretty understandable. For people of the older generation, who lived their entire conscious life under Soviet power, it still remains the only thing they still can think about. Obs: Are there earlier Russian writers who influenced you? VP: There were so many. I guess every writer that I have ever read. When I was about seven or eight years old, I started to read Chekhov's funny stories. You know, he started as a writer by writing short, funny stories for magazines in Moscow and St Petersburg. Obs: Do you have a belief in the purpose of fiction? VP: No. I think if you're a writer you'd rather not think about general issues. If you are not creative, you could have thoughts like that, but if you're a writer they won't help you. The more general ideas you have, the worse it is for what you write. I'm not into the theory of literature. Obs: You're also a Buddhist? VP: I'm a student. I practise and quite often I go to the Zen retreats. The last one, in South Korea, lasted for three months last winter. It was the finest way to enter the millennium. For the entire time, you are given only rice and seaweed; for the New Year party, we were given a slice of pizza and a can of Coke. Obs: How would you judge the Russian literary scene at the moment? VP: I really don't consider myself a part of the literary scene. It's something that is really harmful for a writer to establish and maintain any contact with the so-called literary scene. A literary scene is something that never produces literature. It only produces the so-called literary life, which has nothing to do with books. If you want to write books, you've got to keep as far from it as you can. So I never mix in literary circles. I don't spend my time talking with other writers. Obs: What are you working on now? VP: I'm writing short stories and considering my next novel. Obs: What do you feel about your new President? VP: My new President? Actually, the funny thing about it was that I found out that Russia's having a new leader two months after you did, because I was in Korea. We didn't have any link with the outside world. Even talking is prohibited in that retreat. You don't talk; you write notes. So I didn't know anything about it. I don't think much about Mr Putin. The only thing I can tell you is that I think he was elected for two reasons. First, because he's a very fresh face for the average Russian. Though he was KGB director, he wasn't in the media. He was in the shadows. If you live in Russia, after a while you start to perceive all active politicians as members of the same gang of crooks, like some rabble on the station. In Russia, it happens there are crooks who are playing cards. Some people play with them and they pretend that they lose. Some people pretend that they win. But actually, they're in the same game; they're just cheating people; they're trying to make you play. You'll never win. So I think all our politicians, whether they are communists, the so-called liberal democrats, the so-called Right, they're all perceived as members of the same company of crooks. But Putin was something fresh, something new. That was one reason. The second is that he's a very good communicator, Russian-style. He really can make it. He has this instant access to your attention. I think it's just his natural leadership. Russians perceive Putin pretty much like Americans perceived Reagan. And then perhaps this Chechen war helped. He was very belligerent and many Russians took a view that maybe he solved that problem. Actually, you know, I invented a good term about the Russian society to come. I love it. It's called dot.communism.",

In an essay entitled 'Give War a Chance', quoted by William Shawcross in his new book on the past decade of peacekeeping operations, Luttwak argues that governments and the international community should resist 'the emotional impulse to intervene in other people's wars - not because they are indifferent to human suffering but precisely because they care about it and want to facilitate the advent of peace'. </p> <p>As someone who would fit into the description of a 'cruise-missile liberal', I find Luttwak's view, and that of the diplomat, impossible to agree with, but it usefully underlines the emerging policy of 'armed humanitarianism' that has appeared in the past 10 years. </p> <p>The doctrine of armed humanitarianism, as framed in UN Security Council resolution 794 in December 1992 to deal with the crisis in Somalia, was to define the post-Cold War landscape of the new world disorder. </p> <p>But it was to be doctrine that was inconsistently applied and was as ill-conceived as it was often ill-considered in its application.

For long before the United States was forced to confront the horror of its dead servicemen being dragged naked through the dusty streets of Mogadishu, 'the crossing of the Mogadishu line' came to be a test of the international community's resolve in dealing with intractable violence of the post-Cold War era. The belated response in Somalia, like so many of the crises described in this book, given impetus by the international media to 'do something', was summed up memorably by the then secretary general of the UN, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. </p> <p>Comparing the response to Bosnia to that in Somalia, where thousands were dying from the starvation, to which the the collapse of civil order into tribalism had contributed, he accused the Security Council of 'fighting a rich man's war in Yugoslavia while not lifting a finger to Somalia'. </p> <p>Shawcross does not leave it there, quoting Boutros Boutros-Ghali's complaint to the British ambassador to the United Nations that the crises in Bosnia and Somalia were similar, 'except for the fact that the parties in Somalia are not sophisticated and did not wish the UN to become involved, whereas those in Bosnia are sophisticated, welcome the UN, but violate the agreements the UN helps them conclude'. </p> <p>In the end, it would turn out to be an important distinction as the belated - and largely US mission - trundled up Somalia's beaches and headed towards disaster.

'Too many' even then. </p> <p>On the cover of Yasmin Alibhai-Brown's new book, the second Queen Elizabeth is shown not whited-up like her predecessor, but delicately browned, making her a rather attractive Asian matriarch. The point is not simply to shock, but to ram home the truth that this country is forever changed. The long consequences of having large and settled Muslim, Hindu and black Caribbean communities here are only beginning to unfold. </p> <p>So the 'we' in the title is deliberately ambiguous. The author came to Britain from Uganda in 1972, and her 'we' is often black and Asian, or black women or Muslims, but this is also a handbook for the rest of us. Her overarching 'we' means 'we British'. </p> <p>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown is the leading black female commentator in the British media - 'Leading? Only!' she might tartly reply - and she fully shares the unease and cultural uncertainty about the family, social cohesion, materialism, community values and gender of most of her peers.

Imagining the New Britain Yasmin Alibhai-Brown Allen Lane \u00a318.99, pp274 Buy it at BOL 'There are of late divers blackamoors brought into this realme, of which kinde of people there are already to manie consyderying howe god hath blessed this land with great people of our nation...' Not some semi-literate racist seething with worry about asylum-seekers in a letter to the Sun, but Queen Elizabeth I, writing to the mayors of England's major cities in 1596, urging a policy of repatriation of English blacks. 'Too many' even then. On the cover of Yasmin Alibhai-Brown's new book, the second Queen Elizabeth is shown not whited-up like her predecessor, but delicately browned, making her a rather attractive Asian matriarch. The point is not simply to shock, but to ram home the truth that this country is forever changed. The long consequences of having large and settled Muslim, Hindu and black Caribbean communities here are only beginning to unfold. So the 'we' in the title is deliberately ambiguous. The author came to Britain from Uganda in 1972, and her 'we' is often black and Asian, or black women or Muslims, but this is also a handbook for the rest of us. Her overarching 'we' means 'we British'. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown is the leading black female commentator in the British media - 'Leading? Only!' she might tartly reply - and she fully shares the unease and cultural uncertainty about the family, social cohesion, materialism, community values and gender of most of her peers. Her distinguishing mark is that she is not a fully paid-up member of the current cliques. Her faith, gender and colour mean she lives not only in newspapers and policy-wonking but also in a saltier environment which is mostly unheard in the national conversation and which is far more critical of white liberal Britain.

Prior to that book, prior to the Booker Prize and to Ralph Fiennes and the seven Oscars, Ondaatje had written two other novels, as well as a critically successful memoir and 10 volumes of poetry, including his stunning Collected Works of Billy the Kid. He was a writer widely, and perhaps primarily, admired by other writers for the way in which he could find hard-edged lyricism in the most startling of places, for the formal risks he took with his prose. </p> <p>In search of a way of marketing him, publishers and critics often bracketed Ondaatje with the pre-fatwa Salman Rushdie or with Anita Desai or Shiva Naipaul, a 'commonwealth' author, in the patronising term of the time, an explorer of the post-colonial realities he inhabited as a fact of his upbringing in Sri Lanka. But The English Patient changed all of that; The English Patient has made Ondaatje a name that does not require any categorisation. And it has also left him with the best kind of problem: what a studiously 'poetic' novelist should do with a guaranteed six-figure print run. </p> <p>What he has done, it appears, is to spend those seven years in something of a wilful spirit of retrenchment. He has returned to his native Sri Lanka, first to write a volume of poetry, Handwriting, which coolly adventured in some of the island's legends, and now to write a novel which deals with the more extreme realities of the time long after his leaving: the worst of the three-way civil war that took hold in the mid-Eighties and the early Nineties. Both projects seem an effort to unearth and re-examine some of the legacy of his birth, but in this case it is a literal exhumation: Anil's Ghost is told primarily through the eyes of a forensic pathologist. </p> <p>Ondaatje has always been a writer who looks for ways beneath the skin of the subjects of his novels. In The English Patient, he explored the question of how to begin to feel when the skin has been burnt away; here he peels back yet another layer and sifts through the bones of his incendiary native island. Anil, through whom most of the story is told, arrives in Colombo after an absence of 15 years spent first in the calm lecture halls of Guy's Hospital and latterly in Oklahoma where she established the 'Fuck Yorick School of Forensics'. </p> <p>She has invented for herself a series of protections - not least the man's name she 'bought' long ago from her brother for 100 rupees and an unnamed sexual favour - to guard against the cruelties to which her profession exposes her. In any case, she believes she has been away long enough 'to interpret Sri Lanka with a long-distance gaze'. She comes home as a one-woman envoy of the UN with the brief to expose some of the truth of the island's untold murders by studying what corpses she can find. </p> <p>In the West, Ondaatje writes, Anil 'had come to expect clearly marked roads to the source of most mysteries'. But here there is no signposting. Anil is often in the dark in this book; she pokes about by the light of flickering matches in ancient caves; she works in the holds of abandoned ships and in the ballrooms of derelict mansions. As she becomes ever more wary of the gaze of the authorities, the Moon takes on the shape of a laboratory light and under its dim glow she tries to make one corpse in particular, a man she suspects has been murdered by the government, offer up its secrets. Anil is aided in her work by a local archaeologist, Sarath. Sarath gives Ondaatje licence to wander through Sri Lanka's mythic past and excavate parallels with its present carnage. </p> <p>Thus ancient stone Bodhisattvas with missing limbs spread around the world's museums conjure the bloody reality of landmine victims; the tortured bodies of disappeared political activists lie hidden in sacred burial grounds. 'Archaeologists can read a bucket of soil like a good historical novel,' says Anil of Sarath; but a soil narrative comes as a series of fragments. Ondaatje's novel mimics this reading of history, and as his tale progresses it also becomes more diffuse. </p> <p>At its margins are the ghosts of characters whose histories are related in hushed italics: the schoolgirl who walks the same way to school each day and one morning sees the heads of four students on stakes at a familiar bridge; the socialite doctor kidnapped by insurgents and forced to face the dawn-to-dusk reality of each day's new set of casualties. </p> <p>Murders occur like whispers: monks are shot as they sleep; men are quietly strangled and bundled out of windows as trains pass through tunnels. Like The English Patient, Anil's Ghost is in part a novel about numbness in the face of these horrors of war, and the strategies by which the mind retains its humanity: a concentration on fine detail, a love of ancient words, the possibilities of love. </p> <p>As she digs for truth, Anil turns up lives like her own that are pregnant with unspoken sadnesses, in particular the inscrutable loneliness of Sarath and the curious Ananda, arrack drinker, painter of the eyes of the Buddha and modeller of human skulls. </p> <p>The danger of delineating numbness is that it can spread; Ondaatje has never been lost for an elegant phrase but here some of his more lugubrious imagery chloroforms his narrative. At one point, taping up the charred corpse, Sarath suggests a trip to the local temple as the sun goes down. Anil, writes Ondaatje, 'didn't like the abrupt switch to something aesthetic'. Her disquiet could equally apply, on occasion, to the author's own methods. Metaphors sometimes seem to be sunning themselves on rocks in this book; patients have a tendency to lie etherised on tables while the author gets on with describing the evening spreading out against against the sky. </p> <p>At times - and who wouldn't want to write another English Patient? - it seems like Michael Ondaatje has set out to write a Michael Ondaatje novel, and as a result there is a self-consciousness in the lyricism that was absent from the author's earlier work. There is too much poetry in this book and in some distinct ways there is also not quite enough.</p>",

By the broken doorbell is a handwritten sign marked 'HUM' and behind the white steel gate a young, bearded man in camouflage uniform stands guard, gripping a Kalashnikov. This is home to Harkat ul-Mujahideen, listed as a terrorist organisation by the US State Department and the most hardline of the Islamic movements fighting the Indian army in Kashmir. For 11 years Harkat and a dozen other militant groups have been training thousands of young men to cross the 462-mile Line of Control dividing the Himalayan state of Kashmir and to give their lives in a bitter guerrilla war against Indian security forces. Pakistan's new military regime says it is willing to talk to India about their rival claims to the Muslim-majority state. India refuses to come to the table until the militants lay down their weapons. But the leaders of the three main Pakistan-based Islamic groups operating in Kashmir have told The Observer they are preparing for a new round of heavy fighting this year. 'We will fight until the last drop of blood is running in our veins to seek the blessing of Allah,' said one of Harkat 's most senior Kashmir commanders, known as Altaf. A Harkat splinter group was behind the kidnapping of six tourists in Indian Kashmir in July 1995, including Britons Keith Wells and Paul Mangan whose bodies have never been found. Harkat was also accused of organising the Indian Airlines hijacking in Afghanistan at Christmas, in which one passenger was stabbed to death. The group denies it was involved. 'We are not terrorists,' said Altaf, crouched on a rug and wearing a camouflage waistcoat over his traditional shalwar kameez clothes. 'This generation will put the last nail in India's coffin. Our companions are fighting in Bosnia and in Chechnya, and we are hopeful Allah will not disappoint us.' As part of a new offensive the militant groups have begun using 'death squads' or fedayin , Altaf said. Well-armed fighters working alone or in small groups take on heavily fortified Indian positions, with little hope of escaping alive. One militant killed himself and five Indian soldiers when he drove into an Indian army base in Srinagar this month in a car packed with explosives. Lashker-e-Taiba, another militant group, has led 26 fedayin missions in Kashmir since last summer. Only 14 fighters have returned alive.

'India is losing occupied Kashmir and inshallah (God willing) within two to three years we will liberate Kashmir.' The group runs training camps on the Pakistan side of Kashmir, an area Islamabad calls Azad, or free, Kashmir. For three weeks, recruits are given religious training before taking a three-month course in guerrilla warfare. New Delhi says its intelligence shows squads of fighters massing on the Pakistan side of Kashmir, preparing for a spring offensive when the mountain snows begin to melt. More than 10,000 people gathering in Muzaffarabad for a conference on Kashmir heard a strident call to arms from militant commanders and even mainstream religious Pakistani figures like Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of the powerful Jamaat-i Islami group. Although President Bill Clinton and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook have pushed for negotiations to end the dispute, there is little sign of a thaw in relations. India and Pakistan have already fought three bloody wars since Partition in 1947, and a year ago the two newly nuclear-armed countries nearly sparked a fourth war in Kashmir's Kargil mountains.

      "body": "<p>Friday's extraordinary news that Alchemy had terminated negotiations to take on Rover has plunged the West Midlands economy into fresh crisis. Thanks to a high-level poker game where both main players folded, 50,000 jobs could be lost by June. </p> <p> In high-risk negotiations, both Alchemy and BMW thought they held the aces.</p> <p> 'Alchemy thought they were the only game in town and tried to extract more aid from BMW,' said car industry expert Professor Kumar Bhattcharyya of Warwick University. 'BMW, convinced that the DTI was backing Phoenix, thought that it could use that as a lever to palm off redundancy costs on to Alchemy. Both thought they were negotiating from positions of strength.'</p> <p> Alchemy's decision to pull its deal when on the point of victory followed a BMW statement which seemed to end the Phoenix bid last Thursday lunchtime. An hour later, the German car maker foisted on to Alchemy 11 new bid conditions. These included financial guarantees to Rover dealers, plus Alchemy taking on pension and redundancy. </p> <p> 'The conditions would have meant Alchemy stumping up hundreds of millions of pounds,' said an Alchemy spokesman. 'At 2.30pm on Thursday, Jon Moulton thought he had a deal. By six, it was dead.' The resulting break-down in talks, say observers, left BMW in tatters.

      "bodyText": "Friday's extraordinary news that Alchemy had terminated negotiations to take on Rover has plunged the West Midlands economy into fresh crisis. Thanks to a high-level poker game where both main players folded, 50,000 jobs could be lost by June. In high-risk negotiations, both Alchemy and BMW thought they held the aces. 'Alchemy thought they were the only game in town and tried to extract more aid from BMW,' said car industry expert Professor Kumar Bhattcharyya of Warwick University. 'BMW, convinced that the DTI was backing Phoenix, thought that it could use that as a lever to palm off redundancy costs on to Alchemy. Both thought they were negotiating from positions of strength.' Alchemy's decision to pull its deal when on the point of victory followed a BMW statement which seemed to end the Phoenix bid last Thursday lunchtime. An hour later, the German car maker foisted on to Alchemy 11 new bid conditions. These included financial guarantees to Rover dealers, plus Alchemy taking on pension and redundancy. 'The conditions would have meant Alchemy stumping up hundreds of millions of pounds,' said an Alchemy spokesman. 'At 2.30pm on Thursday, Jon Moulton thought he had a deal. By six, it was dead.' The resulting break-down in talks, say observers, left BMW in tatters. Losing \u00a32 million a day, thanks to its British subsidiary, there is a real likelihood that the Bavarian car giant may shut the Longbridge plant in Birmingham if it cannot find an alternative firm capable of taking it on within its self-imposed 30-day deadline. If this happens, up to 50,000 jobs in the West Midlands could go. Worse still, BMW's reputation in this country would take a severe pounding which could affect sales of its up-market models. 'BMW has already seen its market share drift downwards in Britain since it first announced it was giving Rover away to Alchemy,' said Tony Woodley, of the Transport and General Workers Union. 'If it closed Longbridge, BMW's reputation in this country would never recover.' It seems unlikely that Moulton, Alchemy's abrasive managing partner, will return to the negotiating table with BMW. If Alchemy is finished, only one man can save Rover. John Towers, a bluff, affable ex-Rover executive, appears to offer the only means by which Rover could survive as a car manufacturer. The 52-year-old Durham engineering graduate is now embarking on the most important month of his life. His task, which early last week seemed inconceivable, is to raise over \u00a3500m needed to keep Rover alive as a mass volume car maker for a year. While his Phoenix consortium - an alliance of wealthy West Midlands businessmen, venture capitalists, Rover dealerships and unions - have stubbornly refused to detail who will put up the cash for Rover, the consortium has one powerful ally. Within minutes of the Alchemy news breaking, Towers was in talks with DTI Minister Stephen Byers about raising funds for his consortium, say well-placed sources. Since BMW announced it was ridding itself of Rover on 16 March, the ultra-Blairite Trade Minister has been accused of failing to heed BMW warnings that the strength of sterling was damaging Rover car sales. Now in fear of losing his job, Byers's one hope to stop job losses jobs is to facilitate a Towers rescue bid. 'Byers has been incredibly active through all this. He's acting as a facilitator and is doing everything he can to back Phoenix. He has no option,' said a union official. 'Towers is the only game in town and this one-month end-game scenario is concentrating minds like never before.' However, on Thursday night before the Alchemy announcement, it seemed Byers had backed a loser. A tumultuous week for Byers and Towers began last week when a number of reports wrote off the Phoenix bid as doomed to fail. The suggestion continued to circulate until last Wednesday when Towers, with Nick Stephenson (the brother of Alex Stephenson, who is heading the government taskforce aiming to minimise job losses), met Werner Samann, the BMW director in charge of Rover, at its Warwickshire headquarters. They got off to a bad start. Towers exploded at what he thought was 'nit-picking' by Samann and BMW finance director Christian Jon von Freyend, over shareholding stakes in the Phoenix plan. After this, Towers was told by the Germans that the deadline for him beefing up his business plans with backers would be extended. Next morning, when an eight-strong Longbridge delegation flew to BMW's Munich headquarters, it seemed Phoenix was winning. Alchemy seemed rattled. A spokesman hinted that it could walk away from a Rover deal if no agreement was reached within the week.

      "body": "<p>Politicians claim to prefer 'real' votes to 'mere' opinion polls. This week will put that preference to the test. If, as is widely expected, Tony Blair decides to hold the coming general election next May, then Thursday will yield the last big nationwide harvest of 'real' votes in the current Parliament. Three quite separate sets of contests will take place - and they may tell three different stories.</p> <p>First, London. Few doubt that Ken Livingstone will be the capital's first directly-elected Mayor - indeed, the first person in British political history to win executive office with a personal mandate. Only 33,426 people actually voted for Tony Blair personally in 1997 - and the ballot paper asked them merely who they wanted to represent Sedgefield at Westminster. On Thursday more than one million people will vote directly for Livingstone to run London.</p> <p>Even if the victor is beyond doubt, plenty remains at stake. The battle for second place is not over. Last week's ICM/ Evening Standard poll showed Steve Norris edging away from Frank Dobson. If Norris does come second, he will claim it as a moral victory over Labour. To make this claim convincing, he needs to score well above his current 17 per cent poll rating. Dobson also needs a late spurt if he is to avoid the humiliation of third or even fourth place. At present, neither main party looks as if it will find real evidence of public popularity in the race for Mayor.</p> <p>The parallel elections to London's Assembly look at first sight to be more fertile territory for the main parties. However, these contests provide a different kind of hazard. They are being fought under a proportional voting system. Electors will have two votes, one for their 'constituency' (normally a combination of two boroughs), and one for a London-wide list. Any party that wins 5 per cent of the list vote will capture at least one seat.</p> <p>The Greens' current 7 per cent poll rating would give them two seats. If they repeat their ability in previous elections to win late converts, they could end up with three or four. Not only would this make it easier for Livingstone to claim his likely appointment of the Greens' Darren Johnson as his deputy, it would dent the ability of the main parties to find succour in the Assembly elections. In 1997 Labour won 49 per cent of the vote across London, while the Tories won 31 per cent. Labour is certain to slip well below that figure, while the Tories may end up with even less support than on that terrible May night three years ago.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats could have more cause to cheer. Their candidate for Mayor, Susan Kramer, could push Dobson into fourth place; and the latest ICM poll suggests they could win 20 per cent of the vote, and five seats, in the Assembly elections (up from 15 per cent in 1997).</p> <p>However, Lib-Dem strategists will be looking outside London for their best result on Thursday. Virtually unnoticed by the media, a parliamentary by-election is taking place in Romsey, where the late Conservative MP, Michael Colvin, died in a fire at his home. In 1997 Colvin won a majority of 8,585. There are only 50 safer Tory seats in Britain.</p> <p>Sandra Gildey could well capture the seat for the Liberal Democrats. In a Test Valley council by-election in the constituency two weeks ago they increased their share of the vote by 23 points, taking support equally from the Tories and Labour. The Lib Dems are using this result to persuade Labour voters to switch tactically to defeat Tim Palmer, the Tory candidate.</p> <p>If the Tories do lose Romsey, it will not be the first time the main opposition party at Westminster has lost a by-election. Labour lost four during its 18 years in opposition after 1979. It would, however, be the first time the Tories have lost a seat in opposition since David Steel captured Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles for the Liberals in 1965. And a year later Labour went on to retain power nationally with an increased majority. Even if the Tories hold Romsey narrowly, the constituency looks as if it will fail to deliver the resounding boost William Hague badly needs.</p> <p>So there is a real prospect on Thursday that voters will deliver bloody noses to both Blair and Hague in London and Romsey. Can either of them look to council elections in the rest of England for encouragement? More than 3,300 seats are at stake - a quarter of them in big conurbations, a quarter in the new unitary authorities (mainly medium-sized towns and cities) and a half in shire districts.</p> <p>These seats were last fought in 1996, an exceptionally good year for Labour. Some Labour losses and Conservative gains are inevitable. The Tories should recapture Solihull, and end a five-year period when they have controlled not a single metropolitan council in England. Labour are in danger of losing Bradford and Trafford, once flagship Tory cities, Oldham, where the Lib Dems hope to further dent Labour's northern heartlands, and Doncaster, where the party has been beset by problems with corruption.</p> <p>Further south, Labour is at risk in Oxford, Milton Keynes and Portsmouth. Meanwhile the Tories hope to take control of other southern councils by capturing seats from the Lib Dems</p> <p>The parties will be studying the projections from the council results to nationwide vote share. Last year Labour held a narrow 37-34 per cent lead over the Tories, with the Lib Dems on 24 per cent. Since then the Tories have gained some ground both in local by-elections and in nationwide opinion polls (even though the polls still show Labour miles ahead). According to Britain's most assiduous council election-watchers, Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of Plymouth University, recent local by-elections point to a nationwide Tory lead of five points, and up to 400 Tory gains on Thursday.</p> <p>At first sight, that would help Hague fend off any blues from Romsey, but not help the Prime Minister deflect attention from Dobson's likely humiliation in London. However, such an outcome would not make the Tories favourites to win the next general election. For one thing they need a lead of no less than 10 points for an outright majority on a uniform national swing. For another, an increasing number of voters now split their vote between Lib Dem in local elections and Labour in general elections. And, finally, turnouts in local (and last year's European) elections have been pitifully low at 30 per cent or less, with Labour voters especially inclined to stay at home. In a general election, where more than twice as many people will vote, that will change. For the Tories to be frontrunners in the general election, they need a lead of at least 15 points this week. That is almost certainly way beyond their grasp.</p> <p><b> Capital gaffes</b></p> <p><b> Ken Livingstone</b></p> <p>\u0095 Comparing the media coverage of his undeclared income to that of a 'convicted Nazi war criminal living in Britain'.</p> <p>\u0095 Suggesting that the international financial system kills more people every year than Hitler during World War Two.</p> <p>\u0095 Demolishing his image as a cuddly moderate by appearing to offer his support to the anarchists who rampaged through the City last summer.</p> <p><b> Frank Dobson</b></p> <p>\u0095 Raising the hackles of ginger-haired people everywhere, when he said his mother had always told him to 'steer clear of redheads' after broadcaster Chris Evans's donation of \u00a3100,000 to the Livingstone campaign.</p> <p>\u0095 Facing the possibility of criminal prosecution for failing to buy himself a \u00a375 licence from the Data Protection Registrar before he wrote a campaigning letter to 68,000 London Labour Party members, prior to his election as the party's mayoral candidate.</p> <p>\u0095 Unsuccessfully trying to force Livingstone into declaring his hand by invoking Dirty Harry's 'make my day' catchphrase.</p> <p><b> Steve Norris</b></p> <p>\u0095 Initially losing the Tory mayoral nomination when a selection panel threw his name out after hearing complaints about his extra-marital affairs.</p> <p>\u0095 Having his open-top bus pulled over by the police for a 'routine' document check, less than an hour before its launch.</p> <p>\u0095 Alienating Asian voters when he declined an offer of a specially recorded broadcast on Asian TV station ZEE TV.</p> <p><b> Susan Kramer</b></p> <p>\u0095 Running out of steam about five minutes into her speech at a Westminster hustings meeting, apologising to her audience for 'losing track'.</p> <p>\u0095 Unnecessarily corny campaign song lyrics: 'Got a pair of Doc Martens on my feet; I got places to go, I got people to meet; I'm moving to the rhythm of the London beat.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Nothing has given me as much cause for optimism recently as this weekend's May Day 2000 festivities. For the first time, environmental issues are at the heart of widespread popular activity. This is a timely rebuff to Westminster politicians who still think only a tiny minority cares about such things and who cynically abandon environmental commitments at the faintest whiff of disapproval from big business.</p> <p>The activities and protests this weekend will probably be interpreted by conventional politicians and the press in negative terms, especially if trouble flares up. They will use images of anarchists hellbent on destroying property and hurting people. Since November, when plans were first announced, the Metropolitan Police have taken exactly this line, warning people to stay away from what is bound to become a riot. The police reportedly regard this weekend as a 'major challenge', presumably hoping for revenge for what they consider to have been the 'defeat' of the City of London Police last summer.</p> <p>Some protesters are attracted by the prospect of a showdown with the 'state', but the explicit intentions of this weekend's organisers are very different. It's no accident that these events are taking place on May Day, when the City is empty. And while the organisers often use rhetoric like 'overthrowing capitalism', it's clear they are also drawing in a wide range of ordinary people concerned about quality-of-life issues.</p> <p>This weekend's events speak volumes about the genuine environmentalism at its heart. On Friday, there was a 'critical- mass' cycle ride around London, which attracted 400 people and was described as good-humoured.

      "bodyText": "Nothing has given me as much cause for optimism recently as this weekend's May Day 2000 festivities. For the first time, environmental issues are at the heart of widespread popular activity. This is a timely rebuff to Westminster politicians who still think only a tiny minority cares about such things and who cynically abandon environmental commitments at the faintest whiff of disapproval from big business. The activities and protests this weekend will probably be interpreted by conventional politicians and the press in negative terms, especially if trouble flares up. They will use images of anarchists hellbent on destroying property and hurting people. Since November, when plans were first announced, the Metropolitan Police have taken exactly this line, warning people to stay away from what is bound to become a riot. The police reportedly regard this weekend as a 'major challenge', presumably hoping for revenge for what they consider to have been the 'defeat' of the City of London Police last summer. Some protesters are attracted by the prospect of a showdown with the 'state', but the explicit intentions of this weekend's organisers are very different. It's no accident that these events are taking place on May Day, when the City is empty. And while the organisers often use rhetoric like 'overthrowing capitalism', it's clear they are also drawing in a wide range of ordinary people concerned about quality-of-life issues. This weekend's events speak volumes about the genuine environmentalism at its heart. On Friday, there was a 'critical- mass' cycle ride around London, which attracted 400 people and was described as good-humoured. Yesterday and today, a large conference, May Day 2000: a Festival of Anti-capitalist Action, has laid on workshops on GM foods, animal rights and the environmental impact of the Serbian war. Tomorrow's Guerrilla Gardening is the central focus of the 'festivities'.

'It is time to sweep away the quango state, to take power back from big government and share it with the people,' the writer said. 'London will have its own elected mayor.'</p> <p>Tony Blair's book set the tone for the Government he was about to lead. Bright, young, modern, confident, effective. These were the buzz words. Life in New Britain was going to be different. Of course it was.</p> <p>Blair is four years older now. Four years more bruised. Four years more battered. On Thursday he will almost certainly see his nemesis, Ken Livingstone, win one of the most powerful political posts in Britain - that of Mayor of London. Blair can never have thought, in the sunny uplands of 1996, that it would come to this.</p> <p>On the same day, Blair will see hundreds of Labour councillors across the country lose their seats. In many wards the turnout will be miserable because the party cannot get its vote out. In recent council by-elections on Merseyside and in South Yorkshire, the turnout has been as low as 6 per cent.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Blair will again grapple with the stalled mess that is Northern Ireland, meeting Bertie Ahern, the Irish Prime Minister. By next Friday, BMW could have pulled every last lock, stock and barrel from the Rover plant in the West Midlands. Labour councillors in the region are likely to be punished more harshly than most.</p> <p>This week will also see one of the biggest backbench rebellions of this Government. Up to 50 Labour MPs are set to walk through the No lobby, to show what they think of John Prescott's plans for the partial privatisation of air traffic control centres.</p> <p>And, for relaxation, next weekend Blair can sit down and watch two programmes on Channel 4 that will not cheer him up at all. The Mo Mowlam Story, which will once again rake over all the problems of her sacking as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and You the Jury, on Labour's perceived failure to put through its programme for building a modern, fair Britain.</p> <p>The case for the prosecution will be led by Labour MP Diane Abbott. Peter Kilfoyle MP, the rebel former Minister who says he speaks for Labour's heartlands, will be a key witness.</p> <p>Much has been made of Blair's apology, in The Observer three weeks ago, over his treatment of the leader of the Welsh Assembly, Rhodri Morgan. He has also expressed regrets over his failure to appoint Paddy Ashdown to the Cabinet and has talked of his restlessness at the pace of change.</p> <p>Britain's parliament and government is not yet the modern example to the world Blair wanted, the party's own private focus group work reveals that women in particular are increasingly dissatisfied with progress. And in three weeks his wife, Cherie, is due to have their fourth child, throwing all these problems into the sharp relief of fatherhood.</p> <p>The prime minister is at his country retreat, Chequers, this weekend. Tomorrow sees the third birthday of the Labour Government. There will be no celebrations. Blair finds himself in an odd world. Support for his Government is as high as anyone could reasonably expect three years into a term of office.</p> <p>The most recent Mori poll may have revealed that his personal ratings across a whole range of indicators (capable leader, understands Britain's problems, is not out of touch with ordinary people) are markedly down, but only because of the stratospheric highs Blair achieved in 1997.</p> <p>Blair's administration has reduced unemployment, cut youth unemployment, launched the Working Families Tax Credit, introduced the minimum wage, brought in substantial increases in child benefit, limited the working week, put billions of pounds into health and education and pushed through the most radical constitutional changes this country has seen for a century. Oh yes, and Gordon Brown presides over a stronger economy than anyone would have thought possible.</p> <p>It could also be said that, whatever Thursday's results, they will reveal that the tradition of voting locally for the Government's opponents is alive and well.</p> <p>'If you had said to any of our supporters that we would be in this position three years into a government, they would have been very pleased - no, not pleased, they wouldn't have believed you,' said a senior Labour backbencher. 'But expectations were so high, so high. It is difficult for some people not to feel disappointed.'</p> <p>So, there is the criticism about the heartlands. So, there is the criticism about freedom of information and pensions and class sizes and air traffic control ('even though Labour learnt long ago that privatisation has nothing to do with safety,' the backbencher said). So, there is concern about control freakery and centralisation and Tony's cronies packing out the House of Lords.</p> <p>Among all the issues cramming Blair's in-tray, Livingstone is the major irritant. In discussions between the Labour Party and Downing Street, party officials have said Blair should refuse photo-opportunities with Livingstone if he triumphs on Thursday.</p> <p>'We don't want pictures of him grinning with Tony outside Number 10,' one official said. 'What kind of message will that send if Livingstone's made a mess of it in six months?'</p> <p>Labour Party sources said Blair would speak about London's verdict on Friday and take a carefully conciliatory line. 'It's up to Livingstone,' the official said. 'If he wants to play it sensible, then that's fine by us, but if he wants to make a mess of it then we are not going to help.' Labour sources said Blair was ready to take 'a short-term hit' on Livingstone, but was convinced that, if Citizen Ken is the man he thinks he is, the electorate will vote him out in four years' time.</p> <p>But there is a bigger issue here. It has long been a central tenet of New Labour that elections cannot be won from the Left. Blair fought to drag the party to the centre, believing it the only way forward. Livingstone is turning that theory on its head and his victory, if it comes, will strengthen the hand of those within government more comfortable with Old Labour: Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, Clare Short and Peter Hain. Expect more of the language of radicalism in frontbench speeches: help for the poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossessed.</p> <p>The approach to Livingstone - humbler, more willing to listen and accept - is part of a wider move to reposition the Government and the party. In an attempt to defuse some of the sense of expectation, and show Labour does not believe its success should be taken for granted, officials meeting at party headquarters at Millbank in London have decided on a less grandiose approach.</p> <p>This is no longer the Government throwing down spectacular statements from atop Mount Olympus. No, this is the Government next door, the Government you can share a pint with, hey, y'know, just doing its best.</p> <p>The local election slogan is a lot done, a lot to do. To this will be added a lot to lose, as the party tries to convince the voters that the Conservatives are still out there, somewhere. But even the Tories, as a leaked memo revealed two weeks ago, don't believe they will win the next election. In her foreword to a magazine celebrating the Labour Party's centenary, general secretary Margaret McDonagh talks of a third term. At meetings of the Parliamentary Party, discussion centres on strategy stretching forward five, 10, 15 years. 'We shouldn't focus on the potholes in front of us,' one backbencher said. 'Otherwise we'll miss the smooth road further ahead.' Everyone thinks Labour is here for the foreseeable future. Except Blair.</p> <p>'One of our major problems is that no one believes there is an Opposition,' a Downing Street official said. Many Labour campaigners are secretly pleased that William Hague seems at last to have hit a few right-wing home runs with his speeches on asylum and Tony Martin. 'They are campaigning well now,' one Millbank strategist said. 'It is effective for their core voters and shows how much distance there is between the two parties.'</p> <p>As part of the 'step by step Britain is getting better' policy, Blair has wandered into the world of apology. There was Rhodri Morgan. Then, a week before, in an interview with his friend and confidant, Robert Harris, in America's Talk magazine, Blair said maybe he had been 'too scarred' by the Labour Party of the 1980s to realise that, when in power, he didn't need to control everything all of the time.</p> <p>He also said he regretted that his major project, an accommodation with former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, a man he respects, had never happened. Maybe he should have been stronger, he said, and put Ashdown in the Cabinet in the days Blair could walk on water.</p> <p>How far away that grand coalition, that big idea, appears now. Yesterday the present Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, produced a 30-page document to mark the Government's third anniversary, claiming it had failed on a plethora of policy commitments.</p> <p>On education, the Liberal Democrats said, most children were in bigger class sizes than they were three years ago; education spending as a proportion of national income had fallen; taxes had risen; the strong pound was wrecking manufacturing industry; crime was still rising ...</p> <p>'Many of the Government's problems have stemmed from their determination to out-Tory the Tories by adopting Conservative spending plans or Tory-style policies,' Kennedy wrote. 'Where in Labour's manifesto did they pledge to cut income tax during a time of crisis in our essential public services? Many people who voted Labour will be disappointed now.' Kennedy has privately said he is less keen than his predecessor on any accommodation with the Government.</p> <p>Blair wanted to be the man remembered for launching a new style of politics, an approach where all right-thinking people could agree on the way forward and implementation would be a matter of efficient and committed management. Now he surveys a scene where business leaders, angered by the strong pound and what they see as increasing regulation, say the honeymoon is over; transport union leader Bill Morris attacks the Government for being racist; and the voters worry about the failing NHS.</p> <p>Senior Labour sources said last week Blair had told Ministers not to get bogged down in the detail of micro-managing their departments. They had to get back the focus, get away from the sense of drift.</p> <p>One man, conspicuous by his absence on the political tub-thumping circuit, a Labour official said, was a certain Stephen Byers.</p> <p>But that, at the moment, is the least of the Prime Minister's problems.</p>",

Expect more of the language of radicalism in frontbench speeches: help for the poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossessed. The approach to Livingstone - humbler, more willing to listen and accept - is part of a wider move to reposition the Government and the party. In an attempt to defuse some of the sense of expectation, and show Labour does not believe its success should be taken for granted, officials meeting at party headquarters at Millbank in London have decided on a less grandiose approach. This is no longer the Government throwing down spectacular statements from atop Mount Olympus. No, this is the Government next door, the Government you can share a pint with, hey, y'know, just doing its best. The local election slogan is a lot done, a lot to do. To this will be added a lot to lose, as the party tries to convince the voters that the Conservatives are still out there, somewhere. But even the Tories, as a leaked memo revealed two weeks ago, don't believe they will win the next election. In her foreword to a magazine celebrating the Labour Party's centenary, general secretary Margaret McDonagh talks of a third term. At meetings of the Parliamentary Party, discussion centres on strategy stretching forward five, 10, 15 years. 'We shouldn't focus on the potholes in front of us,' one backbencher said. 'Otherwise we'll miss the smooth road further ahead.' Everyone thinks Labour is here for the foreseeable future. Except Blair. 'One of our major problems is that no one believes there is an Opposition,' a Downing Street official said. Many Labour campaigners are secretly pleased that William Hague seems at last to have hit a few right-wing home runs with his speeches on asylum and Tony Martin. 'They are campaigning well now,' one Millbank strategist said. 'It is effective for their core voters and shows how much distance there is between the two parties.' As part of the 'step by step Britain is getting better' policy, Blair has wandered into the world of apology. There was Rhodri Morgan. Then, a week before, in an interview with his friend and confidant, Robert Harris, in America's Talk magazine, Blair said maybe he had been 'too scarred' by the Labour Party of the 1980s to realise that, when in power, he didn't need to control everything all of the time. He also said he regretted that his major project, an accommodation with former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, a man he respects, had never happened. Maybe he should have been stronger, he said, and put Ashdown in the Cabinet in the days Blair could walk on water. How far away that grand coalition, that big idea, appears now. Yesterday the present Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, produced a 30-page document to mark the Government's third anniversary, claiming it had failed on a plethora of policy commitments. On education, the Liberal Democrats said, most children were in bigger class sizes than they were three years ago; education spending as a proportion of national income had fallen; taxes had risen; the strong pound was wrecking manufacturing industry; crime was still rising ... 'Many of the Government's problems have stemmed from their determination to out-Tory the Tories by adopting Conservative spending plans or Tory-style policies,' Kennedy wrote. 'Where in Labour's manifesto did they pledge to cut income tax during a time of crisis in our essential public services? Many people who voted Labour will be disappointed now.' Kennedy has privately said he is less keen than his predecessor on any accommodation with the Government. Blair wanted to be the man remembered for launching a new style of politics, an approach where all right-thinking people could agree on the way forward and implementation would be a matter of efficient and committed management. Now he surveys a scene where business leaders, angered by the strong pound and what they see as increasing regulation, say the honeymoon is over; transport union leader Bill Morris attacks the Government for being racist; and the voters worry about the failing NHS. Senior Labour sources said last week Blair had told Ministers not to get bogged down in the detail of micro-managing their departments. They had to get back the focus, get away from the sense of drift. One man, conspicuous by his absence on the political tub-thumping circuit, a Labour official said, was a certain Stephen Byers. But that, at the moment, is the least of the Prime Minister's problems.",

We have the old politics of the Treasury spending round, the Commons questions, the green papers and green leather benches. But we also have London politics, which feels entirely different; and Scottish and Welsh politics, different again. And this is only the beginning.

      "bodyText": "Political violence intensified in Zimbabwe yesterday with the news that five opposition supporters were beaten to death by President Robert Mugabe's supporters in the resort town of Kariba. The deaths are the latest in a series of lethal acts of political intimidation in which 14 opposition members have been killed by Mugabe's backers in the past month. White farmers, black peasants and upwardly mobile young black professionals have all been targeted by Mugabe's ruling party, Zanu-PF, to frighten them from supporting the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). In most of the killings Zimbabwe's police have not taken any action, either to stop violence as it is taking place or to investigate the murders and other crimes that have been committed. The details of the Kariba killings are chilling. Comrade Rex Jesus, a notorious leader of the war veterans who support Mugabe, arrived in Kariba, which is on the shores of Lake Kariba, because of reports that the MDC had a great deal of visible support. He reportedly had orders to stamp it out. Jesus had already carried out a campaign of intimidation in the farming town of Karoi.

      "body": "<p>What is happening in London is no less than a political earthquake. An independent politician with no political organisation is set to overturn all the rules of the political universe. If the opinion polls are right, Ken Livingstone will become London mayor by an astonishing margin. You may live outside the capital, but the consequences of his success for the practice of politics and terms of political engagement extend nationally.</p> <p>This is all the more extraordinary given his track record. Those who worked with him in local government have come forward to testify to his weaknesses - his penchant for surrounding himself with favourites, his lack of attention to detail, his untrustworthiness and his shallow, populist instincts. His period as leader of the Greater London Council was characterised by the worst forms of gesture politics and lack of financial discipline and helped legitimise the abolition of the metropolitan authorities by the Thatcher government. He, more than any other Labour politician, helped to establish the 'Loony Left' label that damned the party to 18 years of opposition. Yet here he is, promising to resurrect himself as London mayor.</p> <p>The readiest explanation for Livingstone's success is that Londoners want to snub New Labour's self-evident desire to control and centralise power around a political programme established essentially by two politicians - the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. Many Conservatives will vote for Mr Livingstone to make mischief for Blair, while many Labour voters are appalled by the crude attempt to manipulate the outcome of the Labour primary contest for mayor. On the other hand, the Labour Party is likely to do well in the voting for the Greater London Assembly and may even win overall control; the ties of party loyalty have not been completely reversed. The Livingstone phenomenon is more than just a protest vote.</p> <p>Livingstone, for all his manifest imperfections, personifies the notion of political possibility. It is not just that his candidature has enlivened what otherwise would have been a lacklustre campaign between three party hacks. A vote for Livingstone will stir things up, asserting the people's voice over the party machines. It is, curiously, a vote for the capacity of politicians and politics to change things - to widen political debate beyond the terms set by the centralised hierarchies of the two main parties. The emergence of Conservative Stephen Norris as the clear second favourite also reflects this mood. Norris may suffer from well-publicised character flaws and imperfections but, like Livingstone, he is his own man. He has distanced himself from the illiberal populism of William Hague and has re-established the notion that a more liberal, pro-European conservatism still retains a political constituency.</p> <p>The cynical response is that Norris knows his electorate - that to make progress in multicultural, individualist, liberal London, he has to say the things he does. Which proves the point. The savvy politician is the politician in touch with the emerging political mood and the strength of support for Livingstone and, to a lesser extent, Norris shows that they have read the runes well. Even Frank Dobson has shown flashes of this understanding, speaking out against the complicated and unnecessary structure that New Labour proposes for the London Underground, which will reproduce the mistakes of the privatisation of British Rail.</p> <p>But Dobson has been trapped in a political Hobson's choice. He can't declare too much independence from the Labour line without losing the benefits, such as they are, of the party's central support, but too much slavish allegiance to the Blair/Brown diktat disables him from building the momentum and coalition that he needs. Dobson's campaign has been ponderous and uncreative, but, as he now must know, to have had any chance whatever, he needed to declare his independence from Number 10 and Number 11 from day one of his candidature. He did not, or could not, and is now paying the price. He risks coming in third or even last, a massive personal and political humiliation.</p> <p>In this respect, what London's electorate is showing is that the calls for constitutional change in general and devolution in particular that developed over the Nineties were not the irrelevant babble of the chattering classes, as they were characterised by right-wing critics and New Labour political strategists alike. They reflected a yearning for a more responsive and accountable politics that neither Britain's political structures nor political culture were and are able to express. New Labour had to champion a degree of constitutional reform and devolution, in part as its debt to John Smith, who was committed to both, and in part because it had to keep sufficient liberal intellectuals onside, who believed in reform, to sustain its broad coalition. But the leadership was never convinced of the case. Rather, it recognised that its job was to redefine the Labour Party as the new One-Nation party of the Centre, so that it could never again be marginalised as it was during the Eighties, and to make only those constitutional reforms that were congruent with retaining the essence of centralised British parliamentary democracy.</p> <p>In London, this expressed itself as the establishment of a London assembly and mayor, intended as sops to reforming opinion but never designed as a serious political platform for devolved, city-wide government. The London mayor has almost no independent sources of finance apart from congestion charges. But this was as New Labour intended - devolution without any content while strategic control remains firmly at the centre. For example, the London mayor is laughably responsible for promoting the public health of Londoners while control of the NHS remains with central government. The candidates have done well to fashion what they have within the limitations, but their manifestos expose the trivial nature of the power they will assume.</p> <p>If the London mayor had been a serious political office, it might have attracted political heavy-hitters from within and without the political class. For example, a Mandelson or Mowlam might have volunteered for the task rather than running for cover, while a substantial independent might have entered the lists. The London Labour Party, faced with the responsibility of nominating a serious candidate for a serious office and left alone to do the task without the rules being bent from above, would have been much less tempted to support a maverick like Livingstone. For this would have been a wholly different political climate, in which New Labour could never have earned the reputation for control freakery because its commitment to devolution and political reform would have been genuine. There would be no manipulation to protest against.</p> <p>But this is not where we are. Londoners are faced with an imperfect field of candidates for an office which is largely of symbolic governing importance. What to do? In our view, the very minimalism of the office means that many of the practical disadvantages of a Livingstone mayoralty are outweighed by the advantages. He is the candidate who most nearly expresses the values of the liberal, social-democratic Left. We disagree with some of his more outlandish positions on the international financial system or the City, but we sympathise with why he says what he does. He is overtly pro-European and pro-euro.</p> <p>Moreover, he has a vision for London that is inclusive, humane and liberal. He is likely to champion bold architecture and cheap public transport and will speak vigorously for all Londoners. He will be held to account for any silly gesture politics by the London Assembly that New Labour has ensured will be dominated by its drones. As for central government, it will need to find an accommodation with a mayor with such a large mandate. There are risks and we wish the choice were different, but he is the least worst option.</p> <p>Given that Livingstone looks set to win overwhelmingly, the second preference vote is of some importance. The decision should be governed by where the vote might have the maximum beneficial political impact - and for this reason we plump for Norris. Although we decry his views on capital punishment, he, none the less, comes from the tolerant, pro-European, socially-conscious wing of the Tory party and if he performs well, it will be a shot across the bows of the rednecks and xenophobes around Hague.</p> <p>If Livingstone and Norris do well, it will be a sharp reminder to the political establishment that there is another constituency beyond that defined by the leader writers of the Telegraph, Mail and Sun. Above all, London is sending a message to New Labour that it is hungry for politicians who stand for something. That it wants a politics of debate rather than milk-and-water attempts to be all things to all men. Voters want political creeds that they can choose between, rewarding those who succeed and punishing those who fail. Without Livingstone, none of this hunger would have been revealed. For that alone, he deserves our support.</p> <p>\u0095 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER Telephone: 020 7278 2332, Fax: 020 7713 4250/4286 e-mail:<a href=\"mailto:http://www.editor@observer.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">editor@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Services would link major airports, such as Heathrow and Gatwick, cutting transfer times to a few minutes, say engineers. In the longer term, a network of high-speed, metro trains could be constructed across Europe, they add. The system has been dubbed the Underground Concorde and is the brainchild of a European consortium backed by Daimler-Chrysler, Alstrom and several major civil engineering companies. The Swiss Government has asked the group to design a \u00a33 billion, 55-mile underground line that could whisk passengers between Zurich and Basle airports in less than 10 minutes.

However, to prevent passengers collapsing from lack of air as they enter or leave trains, airlocks will have to be constructed at each station. It is expected that trains carrying 200 passengers would run every four minutes once the system is fully operational.

It was the new, new thing and everyone wanted a slice of the action, despite the fact that details of what it did and where it operated were more than a little hazy. </p> <p>The company was called Zeigletics, and it was responsible for the development of innovative technology linking sewage disposal systems in Chad. But the company, and the stock exchange its shares were listed on, did not exist. The entire thing was an invention, the brainchild of the two brothers who founded the Motley Fool, the irreverent financial advice firm which started as a newsletter and is evolving into a cross-media empire with global pretensions. </p> <p>'We started the hoax on 1 April 1994 and we suggested people should be buying these shares because they were going up. More and more people began paying attention. We were getting e-mail from brokers saying \"my client wants me to look into this and I can't find the Halifax-Canadian exchange\",' recalls Tom Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool. </p> <p>The move was designed to warn investors about the risks of investing too heavily in penny shares. Back in the mid-Nineties, as the Motley Fool started to transfer its advice to the Internet, moving away from being a pure tip sheet, Tom and brother David became frustrated by investors' appetite for small stocks which often feature in 'pump and dump' scams. That is the sort of scheme where companies' shares are hyped online causing a quick surge in their value only for this to dissipate as those who talked up the firm sell their stake and make a killing. </p> <p>'A lot of people just wanted to trade penny shares online. We kept trying to talk about the Gap or General Electric and they were saying \"look at the shares I've bought. They've gone up six times in value, but the Gap's only gone up 20 per cent\". We couldn't get a conversation going,' Gardner says. </p> <p>The prank created its own dynamic as followers of the Fool started to participate in the illusion. 'In typical Foolish spirit people began joining in saying \"I've already made $6,000\",' he added. The point was to show that people were trading very thinly traded stocks. </p> <p>The stunt created a blaze of publicity, despite the fact that the Fool newsletter had only 360 subscribers and had a staff of two. 'We never had a business plan. We began doing this without any expectation that we would be striking it rich,' Gardner says of the early attempts to found the newsletter. </p> <p>'We sent out 2,000 copies of the newsletter to anyone we had an address for - including those we had drawn from my cousin's wedding invitations. At the end of the first month we had 36 subscribers who were paying $48 a year. We were told later that this was a 1.8 per cent response rate, which is pretty good for direct mailing. However it was mailed to a lot of people who we knew and who were blood relatives of ours.' </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal picked up the Zeigletics story and soon America Online was knocking on the Gardner brothers' door looking to run the Fool's service on its network. The timing of the alliance between the Fool and what was to become America's biggest Internet service provider was another lucky break for the Gardner brothers. More were to follow. </p> <p>Back in the mid-Nineties, AOL had no content and only 300,000 subscribers. 'They had nothing to put on their main screen and our Fool button was up there and so everyone had to click it. We had an overflow of people and there was just me and and Dave working 12 hours a day.' </p> <p>The pair decided to dump the newsletter and concentrate on developing the Fool's online presence. In a sense the Motley Fool (the name comes from an idiot savant character in Shakespeare's As You Like It who highlights the absurdities of others) was an Internet company before the Internet, building interactive communities by encouraging investors to write in and swap information. </p> <p>'We wanted our readers to be our contributors because we didn't feel we were good enough or smart enough to do all of the writing. That's really been the spirit of the Internet site because so much of the knowledge is contributed by the users,' Gardner explained. </p> <p>That spirit was not without problems at first. 'Our live chat rooms contained the regulars who had been with us from the start - money managers, analysts from Wall Street - but then, when we got the mainscreen promotion with AOL, we would find the chat rooms would be full of 13-year-olds who just wanted to talk about Pearl Jam. It was total chaos. </p> <p>'One person was saying \"what do you think about wireless communications, is that a good industry to invest in?\" and the next post was \"I love the Spice Girls\". It was a truly Motley collection.' </p> <p>The exposure brought further lucrative spin-offs. The New Yorker wrote an article featuring the Motley Fool which prompted a raft of book deals. An investment column was syndicated to more than 120 newspapers. Soon the brothers had their own radio show broadcast across more than 150 stations. Some of the guests reflected the Fool's more eccentric side. </p> <p>'We get legitimate guests on the show now. We've had the chief executive officers of Yahoo! and Starbucks on. In the past we've had people like Kenny Baker, he's a dwarf. He was the guy who was inside R2D2 in Star Wars. He had no idea who we were.' </p> <p>The success meant the brothers were able to hire some staff and move into plush headquarters in Virginia. Today the Fool employs more than 300 people and has operations in the US, the UK and Germany. Japan will follow soon. </p> <p>One day the business will float, a move which will bring new challenges for the company whose US site attracts two million clicks a month. 'There is a natural fascination with what we do when the market does well and that can ebb when the market doesn't do well.' </p> <p>Such serious expansion plans are potentially at odds with the Fool's playful image as the pricker of pompous City egos, the more touchy-feely side of capitalism. </p> <p>Tom Gardner, however, argues that the original ethos of the Fool continues. 'Anytime an organisation grows as quickly as we're growing, determining how to develop your culture takes a lot of work. But the spirit has been maintained. We love the mix of intellectual curiosity and base popular culture.' </p> <p>Gardner suggests that such a mix is the only way of encouraging more people to get serious about their finances. 'The humour is the sugar around the medicine. We wouldn't get people interested in treatment if we gave them just the hard numbers.' Or, as Shakespeare's character would have it: 'Give me leave to speak my mind, and I will through and through cleanse the foul body of the infected world, If they will patiently receive my medi cine.' For now the Fool is king. His real test, however, comes when he is answerable to shareholders. Investors, as the Fool knows, don't always have a sense of humour. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fool.co.uk\">www.fool.co.uk</a></p>",

Both have been excellent investments, turning \u00a3100 into more than \u00a3500 in less than five years. Both have performance-related fees which are producing generous rewards for their managers. Brokers Merrill Lynch estimates that Henderson could have accrued more than \u00a340 million in performance fees for the year which ends today, while Finsbury earned more than \u00a310 million in the year to last November.

The result was a widening of margins from 8 per cent to 12.7 per cent. That is still below the record of 16 per cent-plus. Unrepeatable, perhaps, but there should be room for more improvement this year and next.",

There is no attempt here to distinguish between emergency aid and long-term development assistance. On emergency aid, we have provided \u00a35 million of food aid since January - more food aid in the first quarter of 2000 than any other donor except the US.</p> <p>On long-term development assistance, Britain, like other donors, has not taken on any new commitments since the start of the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May 1998, because we cannot have confidence that the resources allocated would not end up subsidising the war.</p> <p>You also say that, 'Short is cutting Mozambique's aid budget by \u00a324 million'. This is highly misleading. It would be fairer to say that the rate of increase in spending in Mozambique was less than planned last year. You also say, 'in the most controversial move, Short is increasing levels of aid to Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone'. In Zimbabwe, our expenditure has not been increased. As regards Sierra Leone, I see nothing controversial about supporting the peace process. Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world and its people have suffered terribly from the civil war.

You say that, 'Britain has halved its aid to Ethiopia despite a drought which has triggered the worst food shortages in the Horn of Africa since the terrible famine that killed a million Ethiopians in the mid-1980s'. There is no attempt here to distinguish between emergency aid and long-term development assistance. On emergency aid, we have provided \u00a35 million of food aid since January - more food aid in the first quarter of 2000 than any other donor except the US. On long-term development assistance, Britain, like other donors, has not taken on any new commitments since the start of the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May 1998, because we cannot have confidence that the resources allocated would not end up subsidising the war. You also say that, 'Short is cutting Mozambique's aid budget by \u00a324 million'. This is highly misleading. It would be fairer to say that the rate of increase in spending in Mozambique was less than planned last year. You also say, 'in the most controversial move, Short is increasing levels of aid to Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone'. In Zimbabwe, our expenditure has not been increased. As regards Sierra Leone, I see nothing controversial about supporting the peace process. Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world and its people have suffered terribly from the civil war. I am proud that Britain has played a leading role in supporting the Lome peace agreement. Clare Short House of Commons London SW1",

      "bodyText": "A new novel by Mario Vargas Llosa has caused controversy after the families of men who assassinated Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo accused him of writing a book that portrayed national heroes with feet of clay. The accusations were made as the Peruvian novelist and former presidential candidate visited the Dominican Republic to promote and defend his new novel, La Fiesta del Chivo (The Goat's Party ), set during the time of Trujillo's brutal dictatorship. Vargas Llosa spent months researching the novel about Trujillo and found that, even 39 years after his death, the Dominican Republic was still haunted by his tyranny. The author says his book, a work of historical fiction, represents the 'human truth' of Trujillo's tyranny. But despite Vargas Llosa's reputation, his version of history is one that many Dominicans feel deeply uncomfortable with. The book has left many feeling exposed and a little embarrassed. Trujillo governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until 1961, when he was assassinated by a handful of conspirators. In that era, many Dominicans acquiesced with the dictatorship in order to survive. Among those welcoming the novel is the Dominican literary critic, Carlos Francisco Elias. 'The iron curtain that we have covered ourselves with for decades has been broken,' he said. Trujillo's legacy was a series of authoritarian administrations, fraudulent elections and a culture that reveres strongmen, including Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, a close aide of Trujillo who led the country on and off and, at 93, is running again for the presidency in May elections. Vargas Llosa told a crowd of more than 800 that everything in the novel either 'happened or could have happened'. Not everyone is so sure, however. Among the discontented are the family of Antonio de la Maza, one of the assassins. De la Maza's relatives took out a newspaper advertisement saying the novel would confuse younger generations who didn't live through 'the system that asphyxiated us'. Former US Ambassador Bernardo Vega said: 'The families are not happy with the book because he treats them as humans who get drunk and cheat on their wives and have human weaknesses, rather than as the heroes we read about in history books.' Vargas Llosa said the complaints of the families pained him. 'If I have admiration for any of the characters that figure in the novel, it is for the seven men who waited for Trujillo on the highway to San Crist\u00f3bal and killed him there.'

Oliviero Toscani yesterday split from Benetton, the fashion house that lavished on him the money, freedom and platform which saw his photographs smash taboos and revolutionise advertising. An 18-year partnership, deemed unbreakable, has discovered that there is, after all, such a thing as going too far. Unprecedented levels of outrage over the latest poster campaign, featuring convicted murderers on death row, is believed to have helped split a team Toscani had compared to Papal patronage of Michelangelo. A statement from Benetton thanked Toscani for his 'fundamental contribution to \"new\" advertising', announced his swift departure, but gave no reasons. Italian commentators declared it the end of an era. For while Toscani will continue to work as creative director of Tina Brown's New York magazine Talk, he almost certainly will never again reach a worldwide audience on the scale of his Benetton billboards.

The saga starts in Hollywood and ends, via London and Amsterdam, in the small Italian beach resort of Lignano where, on a cold Easter Monday evening last week, local police found two Nike hold-alls containing 333,000 distinctive pastel-coloured pills in the boot of a sporty little Lancia.If the consignment had got through to its destination - the streets of Los Angeles - it would have brought in nearly \u00a37 million.</p> <p>The bust was the end of a two-month investigation for the police and the beginning of a nightmare for a well-heeled young Englishman, Alex Bruell, 26, one of two men now in police custody in the Adriatic resort of Trieste, where they were charged yesterday with drug trafficking. The pair now face jail sentences of 20 years.</p> <p>Bruell was born in Bournemouth but raised in Beverly Hills by his father, then an eminent Hollywood psychologist. His mother, Biba Hiller, a Knightsbridge-based property dealer and socialite, last week became the fourth wife of Angus Charles Drogo Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester. The Duke was recently released from a prison in Florida where he had been serving a three-year sentence for fraud.</p> <p>This weekend Hiller, speaking from a luxury hotel while on honeymoon in Jersey, told The Observer her son, educated at top private schools in Beverly Hills and Britain, was 'naive but not a criminal'.</p> <p>'He has everything going for him and has never been in any trouble before,' she said.</p> <p>The new duchess said Bruell had recently been licensed by police in London to work in the security industry. Her husband said : 'I believe he is the fall guy for others. He has been exploited.'</p> <p>The other suspect is 30-year-old Australian Simon Main, believed to be the stepson of an Australian quiz show host and filmstar. Main is based in Beverly Hills where he claims to be a journalist. The Italian police say he has asked Robert Shapiro, the Los Angeles-based lawyer who helped get O. J. Simpson acquitted of murdering his wife, to represent him. Shapiro's office refused to comment last week. Main is understood to deny all the allegations against him.</p> <p>Bruell appears to have less illustrious legal representation, making do so far with a court-appointed local lawyer.</p> <p>Police say the Briton broke down in tears within hours of his arrest. He then outlined, they say, details of one of the most ambitious drug-smuggling operations ever.</p> <p>Bruell is thought to have met Main on a recent trip to California. The Australian gave police an address in the suburb of Studio City, but it appears that he only stayed there briefly before being moved on because of his 'boisterous' lifestyle.</p> <p>Somehow Bruell appears to have been sucked into the world of drug dealing. The Italian police claim he told them he became involved in a cocaine deal that went badly wrong when 14kg of the drug were stolen by an Italian criminal - 'Gerald' - who is based in Britain and has connections with major English villains.</p> <p>To recoup the loss and repay his backers, police say, Bruell hatched another scheme. He travelled to Amsterdam, where Dutch contacts arranged for him to pick up 453,000 Ecstasy tablets. The cost price for Ecstasy is around 70p a pill. British customs officials are now liaising with their Dutch counterparts to track down the manufacturers.</p> <p>Customs sources say that since Ecstasy fetches up to \u00a320 a pill in the US - nearly twice the average of \u00a311 in Britain - increasing amounts are being trafficked across the Atlantic from laboratories in Europe, particularly Holland. If all Bruell's 453,000 pills had been sold, they would have realised \u00a39.5m.</p> <p>The former security consultant next surfaced in the Adriatic resort of Lignano, the home of his fiance\u00e9. By the time they were on to him, police say, he had already sent more than 120,000 of the pills to America. Some went in a Federal Express parcel, others were shipped in a consignment of furniture. The police - tipped off, they say, by an underworld informant - put Bruell under surveillance and began monitoring his mobile telephone calls. 'We created an invisible cage around him,' said Frederico Frezza, the Italian investigating magistrate who ran the operation.</p> <p>Bruell appears to have been something of an amateur. His 6ft 4in frame was obvious in the bars and clubs of the small Italian resort. A squad of 25 Italian police tracked him everywhere, even on the beach. They rented a flat near the modest three-bedroomed apartment he was living in, and hired and borrowed dozens of cars to follow him inconspicuously.</p> <p>Many of the calls Bruell made, police say, were to Main, who had arrived in Rome from California. For weeks the two argued over where the handover of the drugs would take place, the police say, though their conversations were discreet and gave nothing away.</p> <p>'All the phone conversations were conducted as if they knew they were being intercepted,' said Colonel Carlo Germi of the surveillance squad. 'They gave no details of their appearance or information about their location.'</p> <p>Main wanted to meet in the attractive Tuscan towns of Lucca or Pisa. Bruell refused to move so far from his base with 80kg of Ecstasy in his car. Finally the two met outside the pizzeria in Lignano. It was an astonishing lapse of security. The two men were tall, fair, tanned, muscular, very good-looking and very conspicuous. They attracted a lot of attention. 'They were fantastic,' one female admirer later told police.</p> <p>For an hour the pair argued, say the police, then Bruell agreed to collect the drugs from his home and hand them over.</p> <p>At 9pm the police say they watched him park his sporty Lancia in the pizzeria carpark. Main, perhaps spooked by the Easter holiday crowds on the streets, wanted to move on again. Fearing that they would lose them, the police made a snap decision to move in. They swooped, arrested the pair and found, in two bags in the boot of the car, the biggest pile of Ecstasy any of them had ever seen. But there remain a number of loose ends. Main was equipped with a two-way radio with an earpiece and GSM positioning device. Police say he was getting instructions from a man called Dave throughout the operation. He is believed to be an American, and the US Drugs Enforcement Agency is investigating. So far all attempts to track down 'Dave' have failed.</p> <p><i>Additional reporting: Tracey McVeigh </i></p>",

'They gave no details of their appearance or information about their location.' Main wanted to meet in the attractive Tuscan towns of Lucca or Pisa. Bruell refused to move so far from his base with 80kg of Ecstasy in his car. Finally the two met outside the pizzeria in Lignano. It was an astonishing lapse of security. The two men were tall, fair, tanned, muscular, very good-looking and very conspicuous. They attracted a lot of attention. 'They were fantastic,' one female admirer later told police. For an hour the pair argued, say the police, then Bruell agreed to collect the drugs from his home and hand them over. At 9pm the police say they watched him park his sporty Lancia in the pizzeria carpark. Main, perhaps spooked by the Easter holiday crowds on the streets, wanted to move on again. Fearing that they would lose them, the police made a snap decision to move in. They swooped, arrested the pair and found, in two bags in the boot of the car, the biggest pile of Ecstasy any of them had ever seen. But there remain a number of loose ends. Main was equipped with a two-way radio with an earpiece and GSM positioning device. Police say he was getting instructions from a man called Dave throughout the operation. He is believed to be an American, and the US Drugs Enforcement Agency is investigating. So far all attempts to track down 'Dave' have failed. Additional reporting: Tracey McVeigh",

Hardly a month goes by without a study establishing beyond doubt that children who are put into nurseries by their working mothers (a) grow up to be emotional and educational cripples, or (b) are the luckiest, most talented and resilient creatures who ever lived.</p> <p>It's an either/or debate that has had a pernicious effect. Whatever parents decide - to stay at home full-time, to work part-time, full-time, or overtime, to put their children into nurseries occasionally or all day long or use no childcare at all - one group of 'experts' will say it is the wrong choice.</p> <p>But maybe both sides of the debate have got it wrong. According to Ellen Galinsky of the New York-based Families and Work Institute, maternal employment is not the all-determining factor we thought it was. What counts is not if a mother works but how she works. And how a father works counts as much.</p> <p>If mothers and fathers are stressed at work they will 'bring their work home with them'. But (as common sense suggests, and research can now confirm) if they are in happier jobs in which they enjoy a degree of autonomy, they have more energy for their children when they get home. And their children are the better for it.</p> <p>The evidence from a large study by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is that children do best when their mothers can choose whether to work or stay at home. Having been able to make a positive choice about the arrangements that best suit them and their families, they are, miraculously, more effective as parents.</p> <p>The study has also found that, while good childcare can have a small positive effect on children's cognitive development, the quality of family life continues to be the most important influence on a child's development.</p> <p>Family life does not just depend on love, but also on money. The biggest single risk factor when assessing a child's chances in life turns out to be poverty. Common sense suggests all this, but why has it taken so long to find its way into serious research?</p> <p>Tony Munton of the Institute of Education says John Bowlby is to blame. Dr Bowlby is the originator of attachment theory which grew out of work he did after World War II with children in institutional care. Having found their emotional and intellectual development was impaired, he concluded that 'a child's development is contingent on exclusive maternal care, that maternal separation from the child disrupts the attachment process, and that, therefore, mothers with young children should not work'.</p> <p>Policy-makers trying to find jobs for men returning from the war took to the theory with enthusiasm. Women had taken over many jobs and, if they did not now step out of them, the country would have a problem. According to Dr Munton, attachment theory 'gave a theoretical justification to the argument that mothers should not work'. It influenced policy makers the world over. In 1951 the World Health Organistion went so far as to say that the use of day nurseries would cause 'permanent damage to the emotional health of a future generation'.</p> <p>Attachment theory has continued to influence policy on mothers' working, though it has had a shakier career in the academic world. Bowlby's research was about children in residential care. Studies of children in daycare have not uncovered the same problems. Munton notes that Bowlby's ideas on the need for the mother to be exclusive carer were not confirmed by a review of 186 non-industrial societies, where only five had mothers as exclusive carers.</p> <p>According to Michael Rutter of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, children 'can cope well with several adults caring for them, provided it is the same adults over time and provided that the individuals with whom they have secure relationships are available at times when they are tired, distressed or facing challenging circumstances'.</p> <p>These secure relationships do not need to take place inside a home. There is no reason why a child could not also enjoy the same benefits when in the care of trained professionals. Even so, it would be silly, even dangerous, to deduce from this that 'children of working mothers thrive' or that childcare is 'good for children'. It's only good if it is, well, good .</p> <p>But knowing that does not answer the important question. What sort of life do we want for our children, at home and outside, during their early years? How much time do we want them to spend outside the home? How much time do we want to spend with them? When should they start formal education? Now that research has shown how important informal play is, should we put kids into school at four?</p> <p>These are the sorts of practical, forward-looking questions that we need to be asking if we are going to 'get childcare right'. They are urgent questions, says Anne Longfield of the Kids' Clubs Network. More than half of mothers whose youngest child is under five are now economically active, and 79 per cent of mothers whose youngest child is between five and 10, now work. Most have no choice: it is that or poverty.</p> <p>Quality is important to all working parents when making childcare arrangements, but in practice they are seldom in a position to insist on it. Demand far exceeds supply. Only 10 per cent of under-eights have access to a registered childcare place. Fewer than 3 per cent of 4-14 year olds have access to out-of-school childcare or holiday playschemes.</p> <p>And yet 80 per cent of working families use childcare. Two-thirds of children under five spend time in the care of adults who are not their parents. Most of these adults are not trained professionals but relatives, neighbours, and unregistered, untrained childminders. Most families have no choice but to resort to 'informal' care arrangements. With private nurseries charging roughly the same as private schools, most families would not be able to afford formal childcare even if it were available. So they make do with the resources they have to hand.</p> <p>While 'informal care' can be a good thing (as in the case of a doting grandmother) it can also mean leaving children with people who have little understanding of children and may even be a danger to them. But much of the registered care on offer is also poor. No working parent can breathe easily until all childcare workers are held to consistent and enforceable standards.</p> <p>The clunkily named National Childcare Strategy is a vast initiative that aims to create childcare places for up to a million children, 20,000 new out-of-school clubs, and 60,000 new playworker and childcare jobs.</p> <p>It hopes to offer one million children 'safe and enjoying learning opportunities', support one million parents to work or train, and help a quarter of a million parents move off benefits.</p> <p>Its mantra is quality, quality, quality. Get childcare right, and we'll see less delinquency in adolescence and happier, higher achieving adults and all of society will benefit. The key concept is continuity. At present, says Dr Munton, a child will have been through as many as seven or eight different child care arrangements by the age of five, and 'that's not good'. Childcare services should be designed so that children don't lose touch with the carers they love and trust on a routine basis. This is one of the reasons why in the 25 Centres of Excellence that the Government has set up to date, the aim is to provide childcare from birth to age 14.</p> <p>But even the highest quality childcare services are worthless unless they fit in with the way we work. They have to suit shift workers and short-term contract workers, and parents who work long or anti-social hours - not just the lucky few who are still in stable 9-to-5 jobs.</p> <p>So to get childcare right, you have to push for serious changes in the work world, too. According to Munton, the National Childcare Strategy is the most radical piece of legislation we've seen in this country since the formation of the Welfare State. 'But the majority of people don't know about it.'</p> <p>What we need, according to Munton and Galinsky and their fellow campaigners, is to throw out the old debate and begin a new one.</p> <p>The first challenge is to make sure children get the best possible environments wherever they are. The second challenge is to make sure that working parents have access to high quality services they can afford. The third is to make sure that childcare is not compulsory.</p> <p>It is important, says Lucy Daniels, Associate Director of the Work/Life Research Centre, that parents do not allow themselves to be turned into wage slaves. There is always the danger that a vast supply of high quality childcare might give parents less leverage when arguing for flexible, family-friendly work patterns.</p> <p>But parents and children of all ages need family time, and parents with very young children should be able to stay at home with their children for extended periods without having to suffer the severe economic setbacks they do today. The National Childcare Strategy needs to go hand in hand with some sort of National Workplace Strategy.</p> <p>The idea that childcare is not just a private responsibility but also a social one has become a minority view. The majority think mothers who involve others in the care of their children are mothers who are not doing their job, and that Government should not spend money to let them off the hook.</p> <p>According to Daniels, the main challenge is to make the case that 'good childcare, like good health and education, is good for society'. This sounds like yet another piece of common sense. Caring for children means caring for the next generation: it is in everyone's interest we do the job well.</p>",

The study has also found that, while good childcare can have a small positive effect on children's cognitive development, the quality of family life continues to be the most important influence on a child's development. Family life does not just depend on love, but also on money. The biggest single risk factor when assessing a child's chances in life turns out to be poverty. Common sense suggests all this, but why has it taken so long to find its way into serious research? Tony Munton of the Institute of Education says John Bowlby is to blame. Dr Bowlby is the originator of attachment theory which grew out of work he did after World War II with children in institutional care. Having found their emotional and intellectual development was impaired, he concluded that 'a child's development is contingent on exclusive maternal care, that maternal separation from the child disrupts the attachment process, and that, therefore, mothers with young children should not work'. Policy-makers trying to find jobs for men returning from the war took to the theory with enthusiasm. Women had taken over many jobs and, if they did not now step out of them, the country would have a problem. According to Dr Munton, attachment theory 'gave a theoretical justification to the argument that mothers should not work'. It influenced policy makers the world over. In 1951 the World Health Organistion went so far as to say that the use of day nurseries would cause 'permanent damage to the emotional health of a future generation'. Attachment theory has continued to influence policy on mothers' working, though it has had a shakier career in the academic world. Bowlby's research was about children in residential care. Studies of children in daycare have not uncovered the same problems. Munton notes that Bowlby's ideas on the need for the mother to be exclusive carer were not confirmed by a review of 186 non-industrial societies, where only five had mothers as exclusive carers. According to Michael Rutter of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, children 'can cope well with several adults caring for them, provided it is the same adults over time and provided that the individuals with whom they have secure relationships are available at times when they are tired, distressed or facing challenging circumstances'. These secure relationships do not need to take place inside a home. There is no reason why a child could not also enjoy the same benefits when in the care of trained professionals. Even so, it would be silly, even dangerous, to deduce from this that 'children of working mothers thrive' or that childcare is 'good for children'. It's only good if it is, well, good . But knowing that does not answer the important question. What sort of life do we want for our children, at home and outside, during their early years? How much time do we want them to spend outside the home? How much time do we want to spend with them? When should they start formal education? Now that research has shown how important informal play is, should we put kids into school at four? These are the sorts of practical, forward-looking questions that we need to be asking if we are going to 'get childcare right'. They are urgent questions, says Anne Longfield of the Kids' Clubs Network. More than half of mothers whose youngest child is under five are now economically active, and 79 per cent of mothers whose youngest child is between five and 10, now work. Most have no choice: it is that or poverty. Quality is important to all working parents when making childcare arrangements, but in practice they are seldom in a position to insist on it. Demand far exceeds supply. Only 10 per cent of under-eights have access to a registered childcare place. Fewer than 3 per cent of 4-14 year olds have access to out-of-school childcare or holiday playschemes. And yet 80 per cent of working families use childcare. Two-thirds of children under five spend time in the care of adults who are not their parents. Most of these adults are not trained professionals but relatives, neighbours, and unregistered, untrained childminders. Most families have no choice but to resort to 'informal' care arrangements. With private nurseries charging roughly the same as private schools, most families would not be able to afford formal childcare even if it were available. So they make do with the resources they have to hand. While 'informal care' can be a good thing (as in the case of a doting grandmother) it can also mean leaving children with people who have little understanding of children and may even be a danger to them. But much of the registered care on offer is also poor. No working parent can breathe easily until all childcare workers are held to consistent and enforceable standards. The clunkily named National Childcare Strategy is a vast initiative that aims to create childcare places for up to a million children, 20,000 new out-of-school clubs, and 60,000 new playworker and childcare jobs. It hopes to offer one million children 'safe and enjoying learning opportunities', support one million parents to work or train, and help a quarter of a million parents move off benefits. Its mantra is quality, quality, quality. Get childcare right, and we'll see less delinquency in adolescence and happier, higher achieving adults and all of society will benefit. The key concept is continuity. At present, says Dr Munton, a child will have been through as many as seven or eight different child care arrangements by the age of five, and 'that's not good'. Childcare services should be designed so that children don't lose touch with the carers they love and trust on a routine basis. This is one of the reasons why in the 25 Centres of Excellence that the Government has set up to date, the aim is to provide childcare from birth to age 14. But even the highest quality childcare services are worthless unless they fit in with the way we work. They have to suit shift workers and short-term contract workers, and parents who work long or anti-social hours - not just the lucky few who are still in stable 9-to-5 jobs. So to get childcare right, you have to push for serious changes in the work world, too. According to Munton, the National Childcare Strategy is the most radical piece of legislation we've seen in this country since the formation of the Welfare State. 'But the majority of people don't know about it.' What we need, according to Munton and Galinsky and their fellow campaigners, is to throw out the old debate and begin a new one. The first challenge is to make sure children get the best possible environments wherever they are. The second challenge is to make sure that working parents have access to high quality services they can afford. The third is to make sure that childcare is not compulsory. It is important, says Lucy Daniels, Associate Director of the Work/Life Research Centre, that parents do not allow themselves to be turned into wage slaves. There is always the danger that a vast supply of high quality childcare might give parents less leverage when arguing for flexible, family-friendly work patterns. But parents and children of all ages need family time, and parents with very young children should be able to stay at home with their children for extended periods without having to suffer the severe economic setbacks they do today. The National Childcare Strategy needs to go hand in hand with some sort of National Workplace Strategy. The idea that childcare is not just a private responsibility but also a social one has become a minority view. The majority think mothers who involve others in the care of their children are mothers who are not doing their job, and that Government should not spend money to let them off the hook. According to Daniels, the main challenge is to make the case that 'good childcare, like good health and education, is good for society'. This sounds like yet another piece of common sense. Caring for children means caring for the next generation: it is in everyone's interest we do the job well.",

Anglo-Finnish student Sara Cameron, 23, a part-time bar worker, was due to start a new job at the Olympic Village in Sydney this weekend. Instead, 50 of her young workmates found themselves conducting a wake.</p> <p>They regarded themselves as her extended family, brought closer by their anti-social hours. Shutting the doors to the public, they gathered at Deep, a bar beneath the Edwardian Rex Hotel in Whitley Bay, a once elegant resort near Newcastle upon Tyne, with a reputation for lively theme pubs and clubs.</p> <p>The group wondered why and how an intelligent, friendly and, above all, very normal student could end up dead in a muddy field, naked but for her socks.</p> <p>'To the staff it's more like losing a sister than losing a friend,' said Mark Whitaker, assistant manager of the chain of three bars that Sara worked in on Friday and Saturday nights. 'This is the sort of thing that happens to other people, that you read about but never imagine happening to anybody you know.'</p> <p>Sara was technically a foreign student, born and raised in Finland by her mother, but she gained fluent English and dual nationality from her British father, who visited her often from his home in Devon.</p> <p>'Her English was better than mine,' said Mark, admitting that Sara often corrected the grammar in his Geordie dialect. She was so good at her bar job, which she had held since the group of three bars opened 18 months ago, that she had just been promoted.</p> <p>Sara, due to work her last shift on Easter Monday, had completed her sports management studies at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle, and this weekend should have been arriving in Australia. She was full of her plans and, having worked as a steward at the Atlanta Olympics, knew she would have a wonderful summer.</p> <p>Her colleagues found out about her death, in a field less than 50 yards from her front door, at the start of a weekend that was supposed to be the liveliest of the year. Police say there is no evidence of a 'violent sexual attack' but have not ruled out a sexual motive.</p> <p>'It has been really tough on the staff, who are all completely devastated,' said Mark. 'It is not often that you can put 50 people in a room and expect them to get on as well as work together, but we all do. We are so angry and we will not stop putting Sara's picture up on the video screens in all the bars here until the killer is found.</p> <p>'At first we didn't want to talk about it. We saw the tabloid headline that described her as a naked blonde and we were disgusted. People might see a pretty blonde in the picture and think \"Oh yes, she was one of those types\", if you know what I mean, but Sara wasn't like that. She was really intelligent. She spoke four languages. She was very studious and fretted about her studies. We called her The Liberator, because she was so into human rights. She was class.'</p> <p>Her father, Roy, is so grief-stricken that he cannot face talking to anybody apart from the Northumbria police team investigating the case. Her mother, Sirpa, who travelled from Helsinki, is distraught and disorientated in a country whose language she barely knows. They issued the briefest of statements this weekend: 'There are no words that we can use to explain our grief at the loss of our only child. The flowers and love that we have received from all who knew her are overwhelming.'</p> <p>Sara's house-mate, Vanessa, has left the home they shared in the quiet village of Earsdon. She has escaped the reality of waking up to a view which includes her friend's last walk and a large, floral tribute at the entrance to the tiny village. It is one of several that have sprung up in the area wherever Sara was known and loved.</p> <p>There are more flowers, including Vanessa's with the simple message, 'Thanks for two years of fun', by the hedgerow where Sara's body was discovered at 9.30am on Good Friday morning by neighbours. She was first noticed by an elderly woman whose bedroom overlooked the scene.</p> <p>The village nestles between sea and cornfields. Until now, Earsdon's main claim to fame was the stained glass in the parish church that originally came from the former royal palace of Hampton Court in Surrey. The church is visible from miles around. Even at midnight, when Sara made her way home from the nearby metro at Shiremoor, there would be little to alarm her.</p> <p>Sara, slight but fit, trained and found time to work shifts at the Rye Hill College gym in Newcastle. Her work at the bar at the foot of South Parade had involved calming potentially difficult situations among the revellers who flood Whitley Bay. She would have dodged groups of leery, beery lads many times.</p> <p>Police have reconstructed her last movements from the metro station in the former pit village. Sara walked past a row of houses and the Grey Horse pub, where landlady June Dixon knew her by sight. She didn't see Sara that night because the pub had been busier than usual and she was clearing up.</p> <p>At the pub, Sara turned right. From this point she could see her house less than 150 yards away. She crossed the A186 dual carriageway to the path that runs alongside the well-lit stretch of road. Something went wrong as she took the short path up to her house. Neighbours say they heard screams but, used to hearing kids from nearby Wellfield, they did nothing.</p> <p>A young man seen following Sara along the path has not been traced.

      "bodyText": "Her friends should have have been celebrating a new chapter in the life of one of their best-loved colleagues. Anglo-Finnish student Sara Cameron, 23, a part-time bar worker, was due to start a new job at the Olympic Village in Sydney this weekend. Instead, 50 of her young workmates found themselves conducting a wake. They regarded themselves as her extended family, brought closer by their anti-social hours. Shutting the doors to the public, they gathered at Deep, a bar beneath the Edwardian Rex Hotel in Whitley Bay, a once elegant resort near Newcastle upon Tyne, with a reputation for lively theme pubs and clubs. The group wondered why and how an intelligent, friendly and, above all, very normal student could end up dead in a muddy field, naked but for her socks. 'To the staff it's more like losing a sister than losing a friend,' said Mark Whitaker, assistant manager of the chain of three bars that Sara worked in on Friday and Saturday nights. 'This is the sort of thing that happens to other people, that you read about but never imagine happening to anybody you know.' Sara was technically a foreign student, born and raised in Finland by her mother, but she gained fluent English and dual nationality from her British father, who visited her often from his home in Devon. 'Her English was better than mine,' said Mark, admitting that Sara often corrected the grammar in his Geordie dialect. She was so good at her bar job, which she had held since the group of three bars opened 18 months ago, that she had just been promoted. Sara, due to work her last shift on Easter Monday, had completed her sports management studies at the University of Northumbria, Newcastle, and this weekend should have been arriving in Australia. She was full of her plans and, having worked as a steward at the Atlanta Olympics, knew she would have a wonderful summer. Her colleagues found out about her death, in a field less than 50 yards from her front door, at the start of a weekend that was supposed to be the liveliest of the year. Police say there is no evidence of a 'violent sexual attack' but have not ruled out a sexual motive. 'It has been really tough on the staff, who are all completely devastated,' said Mark. 'It is not often that you can put 50 people in a room and expect them to get on as well as work together, but we all do. We are so angry and we will not stop putting Sara's picture up on the video screens in all the bars here until the killer is found. 'At first we didn't want to talk about it. We saw the tabloid headline that described her as a naked blonde and we were disgusted. People might see a pretty blonde in the picture and think \"Oh yes, she was one of those types\", if you know what I mean, but Sara wasn't like that. She was really intelligent. She spoke four languages. She was very studious and fretted about her studies. We called her The Liberator, because she was so into human rights. She was class.' Her father, Roy, is so grief-stricken that he cannot face talking to anybody apart from the Northumbria police team investigating the case. Her mother, Sirpa, who travelled from Helsinki, is distraught and disorientated in a country whose language she barely knows. They issued the briefest of statements this weekend: 'There are no words that we can use to explain our grief at the loss of our only child. The flowers and love that we have received from all who knew her are overwhelming.' Sara's house-mate, Vanessa, has left the home they shared in the quiet village of Earsdon. She has escaped the reality of waking up to a view which includes her friend's last walk and a large, floral tribute at the entrance to the tiny village. It is one of several that have sprung up in the area wherever Sara was known and loved. There are more flowers, including Vanessa's with the simple message, 'Thanks for two years of fun', by the hedgerow where Sara's body was discovered at 9.30am on Good Friday morning by neighbours. She was first noticed by an elderly woman whose bedroom overlooked the scene. The village nestles between sea and cornfields. Until now, Earsdon's main claim to fame was the stained glass in the parish church that originally came from the former royal palace of Hampton Court in Surrey. The church is visible from miles around. Even at midnight, when Sara made her way home from the nearby metro at Shiremoor, there would be little to alarm her. Sara, slight but fit, trained and found time to work shifts at the Rye Hill College gym in Newcastle. Her work at the bar at the foot of South Parade had involved calming potentially difficult situations among the revellers who flood Whitley Bay. She would have dodged groups of leery, beery lads many times. Police have reconstructed her last movements from the metro station in the former pit village. Sara walked past a row of houses and the Grey Horse pub, where landlady June Dixon knew her by sight. She didn't see Sara that night because the pub had been busier than usual and she was clearing up. At the pub, Sara turned right. From this point she could see her house less than 150 yards away. She crossed the A186 dual carriageway to the path that runs alongside the well-lit stretch of road. Something went wrong as she took the short path up to her house. Neighbours say they heard screams but, used to hearing kids from nearby Wellfield, they did nothing. A young man seen following Sara along the path has not been traced. There is no photofit and it is not clear whether he got off the metro with Sara at Shiremoor. A team of 35 police officers continues to make door-to-door inquiries, returning to clarify or expand on leads. Residents are convinced it must be somebody local because Sara's clothes, or most of them, were found in a school field. Besides, they ask, who would risk following somebody from Newcastle on the off-chance that they would be alone and vulnerable somewhere along the metro network? He was wearing trainers and jeans, they reason, so he would have been refused entry to the bar where Sara had spent the night saying farewell to her student friends. Anger grows as residents suspect somebody is hiding the young man and, possibly, Sara's missing handbag. Local pubs are subdued. Prayers are said in the church, and the local cab firm, somewhat sheepishly, reports booming business because people are too scared now to walk anywhere.",

      "bodyText": "Some of Britain's most prestigious salmon farmers have been accused of using illegal toxic chemicals, which experts claim destroy the marine environment and endanger human health. Jackie MacKenzie, 47, a former worker at one of Scotland's longest-established salmon farms on the northwest coast, has blown the whistle on what he calls 'disgusting and dangerous' practices. The claims will send shock waves through the \u00a3260 million Scottish salmon farm industry, which has created thousands of jobs in rural communities but which environmentalists believe has been an ecological disaster. Despite promotional literature on supermarket shelves showing leaping salmon and idyllic Scottish lochs, critics say the reality of Scottish salmon is thousands of fish stuffed into small pens, fed artifical colouring to make their flesh pink and dosed with chemicals to stop rampant disease. Although there has been anecdotal evidence of illegal chemicals being used in salmon farming, until now no one involved in the industry has spoken out - because of fears of a backlash from the local community. But in a signed statement given to The Observer , MacKenzie, who worked at Ardessie Salmon for four years, alleges he was instructed by the company to buy and use Deosect to kill sea lice, parasites that infest intensely farmed salmon. Deosect is a highly poisonous neurotoxin developed to kill parasites on horses and chicken. It is illegal for use on fish because it can destroy aquatic habitats and is particularly damaging to crustacea such as lobsters and crabs. However, it is much cheaper than the chemical licensed for use in salmon farms. Deosect contains high concentrations of the controversial pesticide Cypermethrin - which is used in sheep dip and some scientists claim causes sterility and cancer. MacKenzie says he bought the Deosect from a farm supplier in Inverness and used a false name and paid cash so he could not be traced. He also claims to have bought Deosect for another salmon farmer and says 'the practice is widespread'. Instructions that come with the pesticide warn it is dangerous to fish and advise the user not to 'contaminate ponds, waterways or ditches'. A vet at Fort Dodge Animal Health in Southampton, a supplier of Deosect, said: 'As far as marine life goes it is about as toxic as you can get.' MacKenzie, who has suffered from hepatitis C since a young age, believes using this chemical and another pesticide called Ivermectin exacerbated his health problems. He said: 'We were spraying this stuff all over the fish without any protective clothing and inhaling it all.' A lot of Ardessie salmon is smoked and sold worldwide. Following the claims, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has begun an investigation into the company, which a spokesman said it was 'treating very seriously'. It has already prosecuted a salmon farmer in the Shetland Islands for using Deosect. Kevin Dunion, director of the Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: 'Salmon farmers appear now to be operating outside the law, with a contempt for both the marine environment and their employees' health and safety. The Scottish Executive must instigate a thoroughgoing review of the industry.' Today's accusations will severely embarrass Scottish Quality Salmon, the body that regulates the industry and of which Ardessie Salmon is a member. Firms that belong to the organisation can use a tartan kitemark on their salmon as a stamp of its supposed quality. James Lindsay, chairman of the group, said: 'We will investigate these allegations and take action if they are proved to be true. But the use of illegal chemicals is very rare and this is just one farm out of hundreds.' Lindsay stressed there was no danger to the public from eating farmed salmon, because tests were done on the fish to ensure there were no chemicals left in them by the time they reached supermarket shelves. Norman Baker MP, the Liberal Democrats' consumer affairs spokesman, said: 'If these allegations are true, this is all very worrying. 'The industry body claims it is well regulated. But if so, how can one of its members get away with using illegal chemicals until a former employee decides to blow the whistle? 'The Government must undertake random testing of Scottish salmon to ensure this dangerous chemical is not found elsewhere.' Environmental groups claim a disease that has destroyed large tracts of the Scottish shellfish industry is linked to chemicals used on farmed salmon. The disease, amnesic shellfish poisoning, can be fatal to humans if they eat infected shellfish. It has plagued Scottish coastal waters for the last decade. John Parry, owner of Ardessie Salmon, is a trustee of Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, a body set up to protect the marine environment. He refused to deny that the farm had used Deosect.

'I had no money and at first you go round the rubbish bins looking for food. Then it becomes too much, it all looks like pigswill and it just turns your stomach over to eat it. Begging came after that, a last resort, I never wanted to do it but the alternative was stealing.' He was beaten up, spat on, abused and stolen from. The perpetrators were generally young men, sometimes well-dressed, sometimes drunk. Once he had to crawl under a car to escape the kicks. 'They'd steal my money, they see a beggar and see the money and take it. But when you've got a fiver that's been raised through 50 and 20 pences, that's a fortune.'",

'I can see the finishing line at last. For a long time I was not prepared to say anything one way or the other because it could have been wrong, but now I feel very positive.'</p> <p>Gordon's nightmare began on a cold, wet evening in November 1952 with the murder of Patricia Curran, 19-year-old daughter of Justice Lancelot Curran, one of Northern Ireland's most influential judges and pillar of the Province's all-powerful Unionist establishment.</p> <p>The student's body was discovered in the driveway of The Glen, the family estate in Whiteabbey, five miles north of Belfast. She had been stabbed 37 times. The pressure on the RUC for a conviction was enormous. Five years earlier, Curran had been made Northern Ireland's youngest Attorney-General, and his influence stretched from Whiteabbey to the highest levels of the Stormont government.</p> <p>As a result, glaring irregularities in the family's behaviour that evening were ignored. Although his daughter was clearly dead - her right arm had been frozen upwards by the onset of rigor mortis - Curran, aided by his son and the family solicitor, put the body in a car and drove it to a doctor's surgery, unhindered by the first officers to arrive at the scene.

Despite the multiple stab wounds, very little blood was found at the scene, suggesting she had not been killed where she was found. A pile of her belongings were lying 10 yards from the body, but they were dry despite the rain and appeared to have been placed there rather than dropped during a scuffle. The judge also refused to allow his family to be interviewed until four days after the murder, and it was a week before he allowed police to search the family home.</p> <p>These factors have led many to believe that there was a conspiracy to cover up what really happened to Patricia Curran. And the victim of the alleged cover-up, say campaigners, was Iain Hay Gordon, a socially awkward 20-year-old stationed in Northern Ireland for his National Service in the RAF. 'I was very naive, I had never been away from home,' Gordon, who now lives in Glasgow, told The Observer. 'My idea of policemen came from Agatha Christie, and unfortunately I found out that reality was very different.'</p> <p>Gordon came under suspicion two months after the murder. He had met Patricia's brother, Desmond, through church and had visited The Glen on four occasions. In January 1953, he was taken in for questioning by a team of detectives led by Chief Superintendent John Capstick, who was on secondment from Scotland Yard. Three days later, he signed a confession which his lawyers say was false and coerced.</p> <p>It is the trauma of those three days that haunts him most deeply 47 years on. Just mentioning it is enough to bring the look of terror back to his eyes. 'To me it's like the interrogation happened yesterday. It will never leave me. I still have the nightmares, and they are still as horrific as when they first started.</p> <p>'The shouted at me constantly. They said if I didn't confess they would let my mother know about my friendship with a local homosexual and the shock would kill her. I had no lawyer or RAF officer with me, and for three days I had virtually nothing to eat. By the end I would have signed anything. The window was open halfway and all I could think was that if I didn't get out of that room I was going to jump through the window.'</p> <p>Gordon's big problem was that he had no alibi for the night of the murder, so, encouraged by his colleagues, he concocted one. 'It was the height of stupidity, but I knew that I hadn't killed Patricia Curran. I didn't think it would matter.' It did. When the trial opened in March, the confession was ruled valid by the judge, Lord Justice McDermott, a close family friend of the Currans.</p> <p>Gordon was spared the gallows, but only after his defence produced evidence which led him to be found guilty but insane. He was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure in the Holywell mental hospital in Antrim. His medical records show that he received no treatment for insanity and seven years later he was quietly released. But the time in Holywell, especially the first two years in a closed ward, took its toll. Even now, check-ups at Gartnavel hospital in the west end of Glasgow terrify him. 'I start to think that they might lock me in there.'</p> <p>Adapting to life back in Glasgow was just as traumatic. He managed to get a job in the stores of a publisher, but only on condition that he used the name John and that he never mentioned the case. After 33 years, the pressure of staying silent became too much and he took early retirement in 1993.</p> <p>'It was seeing all the other miscarriage-of-justice cases being overturned that was the worst thing. I felt I was being left behind.'</p> <p>Since then, the campaign has gathered pace. In 1998, his legal team presented a dossier of evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It threw it out on the technicality that it was not empowered to investigate cases of guilty but insane, a verdict which no longer exists. But the campaign rallied, and last July MPs were persuaded to change the law to allow the commission to investigate.</p> <p>Gordon admits that he will never be able to make up for the time he has lost. But now at last, he is daring to think about the future. 'For some people it might have been enough to be released and have a job, but not me.

However, many dentists have poured abuse on The Observer, prompting Anthony Kravitz, chairman of the General Dental Services Committee of the British Dental Association to send a round-robin e-mail: 'As I thought might happen, all the personal animosity directed to Anthony Browne, Health Editor of The Observer, has alerted him to a further story. He has also received some wonderful additional material. By all means write to the Editor with reasoned opposition to what Mr Browne writes, but please do not e-mail him with personal abuse - it will alienate him more against the profession.' Publicly, Kravitz insisted the BDA supported reform, and lambasted the Government for complacency: 'We are very concerned about government inaction. It is three years since they have come to power, and we haven't officially heard one shred about any proposals.' Calls for urgent reform were led by David Hinchliffe, chairman of the Health Select Committee, who said he wanted the committee to investigate: 'Dentistry has been allowed to drift for the last few years. We need to have a radical look at what is going on.' He said the fee system encourages unnecessary and poor quality work. Shadow Health Secretary Liam Fox said: 'I am alarmed at the evidence of what is going on. We need a complete review of dental provision, looking at access to services, quality and remuneration. The General Dental Council [the regulator] needs considerable tightening.' The Department of Health announced a review of dentistry two years ago, but has postponed any decisions. Lord Hunt, the Minister responsible for dentistry, was not available for comment. anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

Eddington will remain a non-executive director of News Corporation and is bound to support Oz whenever the Ashes are up for grabs. He'll no doubt also have a company satellite dish on which to pick up coverage of his second favourite sport - Aussie rules football. But he has packed his bat and ball for England and BA chairman Lord Marshall is probably so grateful he would even iron his whites for him.",

Can the extraction of \u00a322.5bn from the economy not be considered a fiscal tightening of sorts? According to HSBC, by valuing the licences as the current value of the telecoms companies' future profits, the charges can be seen as a gradual tightening by feeding through to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Aunt Emily, you may remember, is the reason usually quoted for the Government's cautious attitude to switching off analogue TV signals, thereby hastening the digital revolution by forcing us all into digital television. If it wasn't for Aunt Emily - quite happy watching Songs of Praise on her 25-year-old Grundig set - Britain could be blazing a digital trail in multi-channel interactive television, leading a world revolution in new technology and releasing valuable spectrum space which could reap yet more billions for the Treasury. </p> <p>This appeared to be the consensus at a conference on digital television in London 10 days ago. The young Turks were out in force. Here was a revolution that would put the wheel and the light bulb to shame, delivering to consumers in electronic form 'what they want, when they want it'. There were enough jibes at the 'old-fashioned' notion of 'one-to-many broadcasting' to make communal, passive TV watching sound positively quaint. </p> <p>It took a slightly older Turk, Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, to bring some reasoned argument to the proceedings. True, Channel 5 is making a perfectly good living as a free-to-air analogue channel and is probably in no hurry to go digital, but that should not detract from Elstein's forensic analysis of why the whole switch-off question is more complex than a few recalcitrant Aunt Emilys. As he reminded his audience, it took 21 years for the transition from 405 to 625 lines to be complete - and that was with the plainly visible advantage of bringing colour. It was also at a time when renting was more com mon and therefore upgrading was easier. </p> <p>Now nearly all TV sets are owned. While there might be a seven- or eight-year replacement cycle for main sets, these are additions to the household which tend to displace other (still working) sets into other rooms. It is rare, even among digital satellite homes, for every set to be wired for digital reception. </p> <p>Then there are the millions of analogue VCRs which would be instantly rendered obsolete. Even if more than 12 million homes could receive digital television by 2006 (itself an optimistic forecast), there would still be nearly 80 million analogue devices in homes. When 405-line was switched off in 1985, only 15,000 homes were left without the new standard.

      "bodyText": "If my name was Emily and I had nephews or nieces, I would be tempted to sue. Aunt Emily, you may remember, is the reason usually quoted for the Government's cautious attitude to switching off analogue TV signals, thereby hastening the digital revolution by forcing us all into digital television. If it wasn't for Aunt Emily - quite happy watching Songs of Praise on her 25-year-old Grundig set - Britain could be blazing a digital trail in multi-channel interactive television, leading a world revolution in new technology and releasing valuable spectrum space which could reap yet more billions for the Treasury. This appeared to be the consensus at a conference on digital television in London 10 days ago. The young Turks were out in force. Here was a revolution that would put the wheel and the light bulb to shame, delivering to consumers in electronic form 'what they want, when they want it'. There were enough jibes at the 'old-fashioned' notion of 'one-to-many broadcasting' to make communal, passive TV watching sound positively quaint. It took a slightly older Turk, Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, to bring some reasoned argument to the proceedings. True, Channel 5 is making a perfectly good living as a free-to-air analogue channel and is probably in no hurry to go digital, but that should not detract from Elstein's forensic analysis of why the whole switch-off question is more complex than a few recalcitrant Aunt Emilys. As he reminded his audience, it took 21 years for the transition from 405 to 625 lines to be complete - and that was with the plainly visible advantage of bringing colour. It was also at a time when renting was more com mon and therefore upgrading was easier. Now nearly all TV sets are owned. While there might be a seven- or eight-year replacement cycle for main sets, these are additions to the household which tend to displace other (still working) sets into other rooms. It is rare, even among digital satellite homes, for every set to be wired for digital reception. Then there are the millions of analogue VCRs which would be instantly rendered obsolete. Even if more than 12 million homes could receive digital television by 2006 (itself an optimistic forecast), there would still be nearly 80 million analogue devices in homes. When 405-line was switched off in 1985, only 15,000 homes were left without the new standard. What, wondered Elstein, would disabling tens of millions of pieces of perfectly functional consumer equipment do to government popularity? And there's the rub. Whatever proportion of households are prepared to invest voluntarily in digital televi sion and its still-compulsory subscription channels - unlikely to go beyond 65 per cent, even within 10 years - most households will still be analogue in some respect. No doubt the army of Aunt Emilys could be bought off with a meals-on-wheels type distribution of digital converter boxes, funded from the squillions derived from selling off the analogue frequencies. What, however, do you do about the real problem - Aunt Emily's Middle England children whose three other TV sets and two VCRs suddenly conk out with the press of a government switch? At the heart of the problem is an uncomfortable fact of television life for the digital Turks: the mass audience television experience is still as much an integral part of middle England's life as the computer and the 'I want it and I want it now' consumerist culture.

You might think there's never been a better time to stage the play, until you remember that there once was an equally appropriate time: the play was first performed in 1941. The images - that cart, that sad, diminished family - are still strong, but what do the words contribute beyond hectoring? Not much. It's no accident that the part of dumb Kattrin (Hayley Carmichael) is the evening's most potent piece of characterisation. </p> <p>One of the great young lights of the British theatre, Carmichael can't put a foot on to the stage without being arresting. It's not that you're conscious of her acting away all the time: it's her quality of self-absorption that's so unusual.

Moreover, this is the first airing of a reconstruction of the composer's first version of the opera. </p> <p>The work has a complex performance and compositional history. In brief, after the rejection of his first efforts, Martinu wrote a substantially new piece, premiered in Zurich in 1961 and generally used since. Nearly three quarters of the material is different. To British audiences, who have had little chance to get to know the opera, except in a 1981 Welsh National Opera production, the extent of the differences may not be apparent. But version-spotting is a buff's game. For most people, it's like comparing tails when you haven't yet met the dog. The experience of hearing the work in the theatre is what counts. </p> <p>The set, a handsome construction of platforms, was pure Piranesi from front on. But thanks to Covent Garden's new revolve, Stafanos Lazaridis had achieved the still more remarkable feat of showing it from all sides (something Piranesi never had to do). The rapid, cinematic feel of the scenes, enacted simultaneously and on different levels, was immediately apparent. Village life is played out as if on a Greek hilltop, the chorus swarming like black ants up and down the different walkways and decks. The chief priest and elders sit smoking, drinking raki and coffee throughout, untouched by the unfolding agony around them. </p> <p>At the start, massive bells and censers swing from on high, with the high priest, Grigoris (Esa Ruuttunen), up aloft in swathes of gold and crimson finery. Echoes of Boris Godunov quickly recede when you realise that Martinu's individual scoring is transparent rather than dense, linear and rapid rather than dark and weighty. He employs folk instruments, such as the accordion, and makes distinctive use of the harp. </p> <p>Charles Mackerras, always persuasive in the Czech repertoire he knows and loves, conducted a fluent performance, with fine playing by the ROH orchestra. Manolios, the Christ figure, was sung with searing ardour by the Finnish tenor, Jorma Silvastri. The many cameo roles were well cast, with company principals such as Robin Leggate and Roderick Earle as key villagers and Gwynne Howell as the refugees' priest, Fotis. </p> <p>Martinu has always been given a rough critical ride, condemned as old-fashioned and too aesthetically pliable. Here, the choruses, especially, have true grandeur, conveyed impressively by the ROH chorus. Even if the rest of the score at times sounds thin, with none of the knotty complexities of his contemporaries, it makes strong theatre and tells a story. That's enough. </p> <p>Since Martinu had been dead two years by the time The Greek Passion was first performed, he never knew what people thought of it. Britten, on the contrary, was all too alive to witness the abuse heaped on his <b> Gloriana</b>, first performed in 1953, and described by Lord Harewood as 'one of the great disasters of operatic history'. </p> <p>Nearly half a century later, our views have changed. The work may have its problems, but Phyllida Lloyd's celebrated staging for Opera North was one of the great productions of the Nineties. One reason for its triumph is the casting of Josephine Barstow as a caustic Elizabeth I, now recreated in a filmed version for television shown on BBC2. It took some time to grow accustomed to the all-seeing camera following the Virgin Queen off stage and into her dressing-room. Yet the effect was intriguing and compelling. </p> <p>Britten's libretto (by William Plomer) takes Lytton Strachey's Elizabeth and Essex as a starting point, with Essex characterised as the dashing, troublesome love-toy of the ageing queen. Thomas Randle, in flowing black wig, conveyed his ardent opportunism to perfection. The chief regret in an otherwise worthwhile enterprise was the favouring of voices over orchestra in the recording. This is a frustrating habit of music broadcasts on radio too. To squeeze the sound in this way robs us of half the composer's intentions. </p> <p>Paul Daniel and the Opera North orchestra, without doubt doing their best, seemed to be in a different room. This sort of thing ruins people's first experiences of live opera (when singers are in their correct sound proportions), as well as of concertos where they are used aurally to a violin or cello as big as the Ritz. Does no one else object to this auditory manipulation?</p>",

But version-spotting is a buff's game. For most people, it's like comparing tails when you haven't yet met the dog. The experience of hearing the work in the theatre is what counts. The set, a handsome construction of platforms, was pure Piranesi from front on. But thanks to Covent Garden's new revolve, Stafanos Lazaridis had achieved the still more remarkable feat of showing it from all sides (something Piranesi never had to do). The rapid, cinematic feel of the scenes, enacted simultaneously and on different levels, was immediately apparent. Village life is played out as if on a Greek hilltop, the chorus swarming like black ants up and down the different walkways and decks. The chief priest and elders sit smoking, drinking raki and coffee throughout, untouched by the unfolding agony around them. At the start, massive bells and censers swing from on high, with the high priest, Grigoris (Esa Ruuttunen), up aloft in swathes of gold and crimson finery. Echoes of Boris Godunov quickly recede when you realise that Martinu's individual scoring is transparent rather than dense, linear and rapid rather than dark and weighty. He employs folk instruments, such as the accordion, and makes distinctive use of the harp. Charles Mackerras, always persuasive in the Czech repertoire he knows and loves, conducted a fluent performance, with fine playing by the ROH orchestra. Manolios, the Christ figure, was sung with searing ardour by the Finnish tenor, Jorma Silvastri. The many cameo roles were well cast, with company principals such as Robin Leggate and Roderick Earle as key villagers and Gwynne Howell as the refugees' priest, Fotis. Martinu has always been given a rough critical ride, condemned as old-fashioned and too aesthetically pliable. Here, the choruses, especially, have true grandeur, conveyed impressively by the ROH chorus. Even if the rest of the score at times sounds thin, with none of the knotty complexities of his contemporaries, it makes strong theatre and tells a story. That's enough. Since Martinu had been dead two years by the time The Greek Passion was first performed, he never knew what people thought of it. Britten, on the contrary, was all too alive to witness the abuse heaped on his Gloriana, first performed in 1953, and described by Lord Harewood as 'one of the great disasters of operatic history'. Nearly half a century later, our views have changed. The work may have its problems, but Phyllida Lloyd's celebrated staging for Opera North was one of the great productions of the Nineties. One reason for its triumph is the casting of Josephine Barstow as a caustic Elizabeth I, now recreated in a filmed version for television shown on BBC2. It took some time to grow accustomed to the all-seeing camera following the Virgin Queen off stage and into her dressing-room. Yet the effect was intriguing and compelling. Britten's libretto (by William Plomer) takes Lytton Strachey's Elizabeth and Essex as a starting point, with Essex characterised as the dashing, troublesome love-toy of the ageing queen. Thomas Randle, in flowing black wig, conveyed his ardent opportunism to perfection. The chief regret in an otherwise worthwhile enterprise was the favouring of voices over orchestra in the recording. This is a frustrating habit of music broadcasts on radio too. To squeeze the sound in this way robs us of half the composer's intentions. Paul Daniel and the Opera North orchestra, without doubt doing their best, seemed to be in a different room. This sort of thing ruins people's first experiences of live opera (when singers are in their correct sound proportions), as well as of concertos where they are used aurally to a violin or cello as big as the Ritz. Does no one else object to this auditory manipulation?",

      "body": "<p>Matthew Rhys has been practising the art of seduction. In Metropolis, the compulsively watchable ITV thriller (beginning tomorrow) about six graduates from Leeds trying to make a go of it in London, he plays the male equivalent of a dumb blonde: he's an unemployed brunette with unruly hair and devastating blue eyes. Matthew (the actor and the character share a name) is young, lazy and seldom seen out of bed. His main occupation is smoking dope. He is vile to his girlfriends but there is a kind of sexual provocation to his insults and he is rewarded for his lack of charm. </p> <p>Rhys also plays Ben in Terry Johnson's stage version of the Sixties film The Graduate (at the Gielgud theatre). Ben is smarter than Metropolis Matthew but, like him, has little more than sex appeal to recommend him. Ben's hair is nicely barbered, he has a crisp American accent and a blameless white shirt. He is an amusing contrast to Kathleen Turner's Mrs Robinson. She is smoothly predatory, like a Disney lioness tossing her blond mane. He is jumpy as a grasshopper - he majors in nerves.</p> <p>Matthew and Ben have this in common: they don't have to do a thing, at least at first, to get their women. Women are drawn to them like stupid moths to a flame. Ben and Matthew share something else. By a bizarre coincidence, they both choose to take the same romantic initiative: each hijacks a wedding with the intention of securing the bride for himself. I suggest to Rhys when we meet, that he should be careful to avoid further scenes of this kind lest it lead to a most peculiar and specific form of type-casting. </p> <p>We meet at tea-time, at Soho House. Matthew Rhys looks cool - but isn't. He is in no way smooth or over-confident - which makes him immediately likeable. I've always had a weakness for people who trip up easily. (As he left, he got seriously tangled up in the furniture). It is easy to see why he does nerves so well. </p> <p>I hardly noticed him walk in because of the more extrovert presence of his girlfriend, Ciara Parkes, who runs a PR company. She is an untidily glamorous blonde, a good 10 years older than him (he is 25). Matthew and Ciara have been on the receiving end, inevitably, of jokes about life imitating The Graduate - but seem to be surviving happily. Ciara plays the older woman well. She orders tea in a motherly style and makes no secret of her relationship with Matthew, calling him 'love' in a breezily possessive way. </p> <p>The first and most striking thing about Matthew is his Welshness. His voice comes as a lilting surprise after hearing his Mancunian and American accents. He is 'intensely proud' of being Welsh (it is his first language). He hangs out with Welsh friends (he shares a flat in Kilburn flat with Welsh actor Ioan Gruffud). He says that 'though it may be a clich\u00e9', it is 'frighteningly true' that his nights at the pub end in song. Does he sing well? 'If I am honest, I can string a good tune together. I might even throw a few harmonies in.' </p> <p>Matthew grew up in a Methodist, working-class family in Cardiff. Both his parents were teachers. He looks back at his childhood affectionately 'through the old rose-tinted spectacles'. His father's family were farmers, his mother's people lived near the sea. Until he was 10 or 12, he wanted to be a farmer. He feels very much 'the same person' now even though his life has changed so much. He minds about his parents' approval and is at his most nervous on stage when one of his family is in the audience. His greatest happiness, he swears, is travelling home by train to Wales. </p> <p>He went to RADA where he had to unlearn before he could learn a thing. The mannerism police were out in force. 'I was told in week two to stop rubbing my nose when speaking. I had no idea I was doing it.' He is mannerism-free now - except that he often pillows his cheek with his hand. But his language is full of catchphrases. He often uses the word 'frightening' - when he is not frightened at all. And he answers many questions with the words 'To be honest' - there is every reason to believe he is just that. He does not seem vain though he dresses beautifully - he was wearing a white shirt with turquoise cufflinks. </p> <p>He laughs at himself a lot. When I pointed out that he looked miserable in his photo in the programme, he surprised me by roaring with laughter. 'I'll have to change it. I look nerdy when I smile. I have always wanted to be like Marlon Brando and the brooders.' He makes it sound like an old-fashioned pop group - and I can just see him singing in it. </p> <p>He loved playing Matthew in Metropolis partly because he is such a conundrum. He kept asking himself 'Who is he?' He tries to find an anchor - something to identify with in each role he plays. He identified with Matthew's working-class background, he says (a safe choice). Rhys has recently been informed that he can no longer pass for 18 - which came as a shock. So how much does age matter? Does the 10 years between himself and Ciara mean anything? 'No I honestly don't believe it does. It never has been an issue for the pair of us because we get on so well together,' he says. </p> <p>Age was an issue - in a beneficial way - between Rhys and Kathleen Turner. At the audition, he felt 'blind panic', daunted at the thought of the naked scenes between himself and the Hollywood star. 'For the first 40 minutes I was a dribbling mess. She was brilliant: she had been there, done that.' A different take on the experienced woman? 'That's it. The whole kernel of the play was in that audition.' And Turner had a say in the casting. So he must have done OK. </p> <p>Matthew Rhys has been in seven movies - he can be seen next month in the seventh as Demetrius in Julie Taymor's Titus Andronicus. His eighth will be a Welsh version of Braveheart in which he will play a jealous brother by the name of Llywelan. He will be on horseback a lot - he is a good rider. And presumably the film will be made in Wales (alias heaven). Rhys says the most difficult thing about acting is 'keeping your integrity in a world so heavily governed by other people's opinions'. </p> <p>What he means, I think, is: it is hard to keep your head. Does he ever imagine middle-age? Being 45 - like Kathleen Turner? 'Yes - and it's frightening. I wonder: Will I still be acting?'</p>",

      "byline": "Peter Conrad",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is an old and shameless ploy: an economic group whose activities are not esteemed by society - ferret breeders perhaps, or used car salesmen - boosts its morale by inventing an awards ceremony. Silversmiths are commissioned, a hall is hired, press releases go out. No one else would think of celebrating such people. There's a solemn pretence that merit is being rewarded, but really it's just an orgy of unearned self-congratulation. </p> <p>On Saturday at the Royal Albert Hall, the British Phonographic Industry will present the first Classical Brit Awards. The gelled, egregious Kennedy will fiddle, Charlotte Church will weakly warble, Lesley Garrett will effervesce as usual like a shaken bottle of Babycham. In addition, a performance is promised by 'highly acclaimed new soprano Filippa Giordano'. Highly acclaimed by whom, I wonder? By her press agents, I presume: I have never heard of her. And, just to ensure that classical music forfeits forever its lofty allure and spiritual grace, among the presenters will be a man who might himself be given an award as vulgarian of the year: Michael Winner. </p> <p>The nominees are at best middlebrow, exposing the industry's abject dependence on movie tie-ins. James Horner's More Music From Braveheart, competes for Best Orchestral Album against John Williams's latest brash, blatant marches from Star Wars, while Stephen Warbeck's pastiched score for Shakespeare in Love has earned him a nomination as Male Artist of the Year. Williams also appears in this category, for a deadly compendium of his Greatest Hits. </p> <p>Charlotte Church stands to win both as Young British Classical Performer and as Female Artist of the Year. Kennedy likewise divides himself between two lists, as Male Artist of the Year and as a candidate for Best Orchestral Album. These doublings suggest the sparseness of the available talent (if, in the case of hacks like Horner or over-exposed moppets like Church, you can call it that). </p> <p>The ceremony supposedly publicises the vital health of the classical music business, even though it's common knowledge that the sector is moribund. Last week in New York, BMG, the German conglomerate which recently gobbled up RCA, announced that it will make no more classical recordings in Europe. Artists with exclusive contracts found themselves abruptly down-sized: the percussionist Evelyn Glennie has been terminated, and accountants are looking sternly at the cost-effectiveness of the conductor Lorin Maazel and singers such as Waltraud Meier and Vesselina Kasarova. Sony made the same tactical retreat from the classical field a few months ago. </p> <p>How many other companies will soon come to the same decision that the musicians they retain are an expensive indulgence? EMI artificially resuscitates itself by endlessly 'remastering' Fifties records by Maria Callas who is fortunately dead and so need not be paid royalties. Other companies aren't so lucky. The Deutsche Grammophon website currently announces a recording project which is hardly calculated to make the cash registers trill: a Beethoven cycle conducted by Claudio Abbado - just what the world needs! </p> <p>The marketers forestalled the end for quite a while by merchandising personality, selling sex rather than sound. Hence the increasingly diaphanous get-ups of Lesley Garrett. Female artists were enticed into sprawling on the floor in tight jeans like the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter or lolling in bed, as the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming does on the cover of a new Strauss recital.

      "bodyText": "It is an old and shameless ploy: an economic group whose activities are not esteemed by society - ferret breeders perhaps, or used car salesmen - boosts its morale by inventing an awards ceremony. Silversmiths are commissioned, a hall is hired, press releases go out. No one else would think of celebrating such people. There's a solemn pretence that merit is being rewarded, but really it's just an orgy of unearned self-congratulation. On Saturday at the Royal Albert Hall, the British Phonographic Industry will present the first Classical Brit Awards. The gelled, egregious Kennedy will fiddle, Charlotte Church will weakly warble, Lesley Garrett will effervesce as usual like a shaken bottle of Babycham. In addition, a performance is promised by 'highly acclaimed new soprano Filippa Giordano'. Highly acclaimed by whom, I wonder? By her press agents, I presume: I have never heard of her. And, just to ensure that classical music forfeits forever its lofty allure and spiritual grace, among the presenters will be a man who might himself be given an award as vulgarian of the year: Michael Winner. The nominees are at best middlebrow, exposing the industry's abject dependence on movie tie-ins. James Horner's More Music From Braveheart, competes for Best Orchestral Album against John Williams's latest brash, blatant marches from Star Wars, while Stephen Warbeck's pastiched score for Shakespeare in Love has earned him a nomination as Male Artist of the Year. Williams also appears in this category, for a deadly compendium of his Greatest Hits. Charlotte Church stands to win both as Young British Classical Performer and as Female Artist of the Year. Kennedy likewise divides himself between two lists, as Male Artist of the Year and as a candidate for Best Orchestral Album. These doublings suggest the sparseness of the available talent (if, in the case of hacks like Horner or over-exposed moppets like Church, you can call it that). The ceremony supposedly publicises the vital health of the classical music business, even though it's common knowledge that the sector is moribund. Last week in New York, BMG, the German conglomerate which recently gobbled up RCA, announced that it will make no more classical recordings in Europe. Artists with exclusive contracts found themselves abruptly down-sized: the percussionist Evelyn Glennie has been terminated, and accountants are looking sternly at the cost-effectiveness of the conductor Lorin Maazel and singers such as Waltraud Meier and Vesselina Kasarova. Sony made the same tactical retreat from the classical field a few months ago. How many other companies will soon come to the same decision that the musicians they retain are an expensive indulgence? EMI artificially resuscitates itself by endlessly 'remastering' Fifties records by Maria Callas who is fortunately dead and so need not be paid royalties. Other companies aren't so lucky. The Deutsche Grammophon website currently announces a recording project which is hardly calculated to make the cash registers trill: a Beethoven cycle conducted by Claudio Abbado - just what the world needs! The marketers forestalled the end for quite a while by merchandising personality, selling sex rather than sound. Hence the increasingly diaphanous get-ups of Lesley Garrett. Female artists were enticed into sprawling on the floor in tight jeans like the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter or lolling in bed, as the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming does on the cover of a new Strauss recital. The diminutive tenor Roberto Alagna was made to bestraddle a motorbike for a Decca recording of La Boh\u00e8me, with his leather-jacketed consort Angela Gheorgiu clinging to him. Is there any evidence that these crass stratagems sell records? If the business is so buoyant, why are shops closing all over the country, while those which remain open grudgingly allocate ever smaller quantities of floor space to classical music? There may well be a funerary air to the Classical Brits.

There's a painting in his new show of snowcapped mountains towering against a Californian sky. These sugar-dusted pinnacles look like the peaks of the Paramount logo; likewise, the picture seems to be a small souvenir of the Great Outdoors enlarged to Cinemascope size. But down among the foothills, like the cross marking the sender's hotel on a postcard, the word 'ME' is stencilled in scarlet capitals. Dwarfed by nature, the ego shrieks to be heard among the picturesque mountains: a silent word in a mordant visual joke. </p> <p>Ever since he painted Noise in 1963 - a neat paradox of mute noun and loud colour - Ruscha has been playing these word games on canvas. He used to go for the sight gag: 'Heavy Industry' pencilled in feeble graphite, 'The End' printed in Gothic letters scrolling endlessly down a screen. He liked the onomatopoeiac - 'I Think There Is Something Dangerous Going On Here' spelled out in gunpowder - and the word as image; the Hollywood sign blocked out like the final credits to an epic is still his most famous Sixties painting. </p> <p>But Ruscha began with images that naturally contained words, cityscapes of his native Los Angeles, a bristling thicket of billboards and signs. His latest work transposes the language of the city to the Californian countryside, applying it so literally that the words come directly between viewer and vista. One snowy sierra is barely visible behind the outsize message 'Parking for Tower Rcds', a commercial hangover that obscures the sparkling panorama. Meaningless in this context, the words are nonetheless as obdurate as they were: a banal direction that sticks to the urban mind like a burr. </p> <p>Which came first - the image or the words? Ruscha's technique is so smooth, so deadpan and flawless, that it's hard to tell whether the letters have been superimposed or were there from the outset. In Blast Curtain, the words seem to have sliced right through the mountain with nuclear efficiency. In Crash Cushion they hover like a threat of megaton disaster. Ruscha has perfected this illusionism in so many ways that he is even able to make the words seem organic to the mountain. In -so, the single syllable emanates from the snow like powdery air, a pause in the mysterious story that this painting narrates. </p> <p>Sharp Pop with a witty undertone has so long been Ruscha's tune that it is hard to remember that he can also be a romantic lyricist. He loves to give words another dimension, to rescue them from tight spots, to give them a visual hearing. Possibly the least ironic works he has ever produced are the monochrome paintings in the Highways series - four new variations are included in this show. </p> <p>Oregon, Denver, Kansas, Tennessee: the states whip by, ghostly letters receding between grids of white lines. Names stack up, stretching in sharp perspective towards a hopeful future. Portland, Memphis, Albuquerque, Little Rock: flashing by so quickly you would scarcely sense the dust beneath your wheels. These semi-abstract paintings can be read as imaginary maps, routes to freedom for the escapist heart. But they go beyond the diagram into concrete poems for the canvas: every word holding out the promise of somewhere else in an optical trail of shimmering paint. </p> <p><strong> Juan Cruz</strong>, the young Spanish-English artist who won the prestigious Paul Hamlyn Award last year, has so far made an entire career out of words. For 10 days, he gave a reading of Don Quixote with simultaneous translation, a laborious performance in a darkened room. He has also transcribed the stage directions from Chekhov on various gallery walls in faint pencil, a modest gesture to stimulate the mind's eye which turned out to be as distractingly self-conscious as any stage whisper. </p> <p>Self-effacement is the supposed virtue of Cruz's work: you look or you listen, but you think of somewhere else. If this is the case, then he is taking a peculiar route with his latest piece, Driving Home, in which he describes, with outstanding pedantry, the tedious details of a car trip. His voice is relayed through a pair of speakers, itemising every bend in the road, every telegraph pole. There are asides - for example, about the way the windscreen frames the vista - but they are enunciated in the same lifeless, mechanical tone. Cruz ignores the first rule of radio - never sound as though you are reading a script. As a result, your mind has no time to wander before you exit fast from the room.</p>",

The legend resurrected as an all-conquering AOR singer, then the increasingly grotesque cartoon character in her fishnets and fright-wig. Now she is planning the dream retirement: after this tour, she will quit the music business to live with her 42-year-old toy-boy in a mountainside mansion near Nice, filling the days with Herculean shopping trips. </p> <p>So when Turner, in America's ultimate Retirement State, announces to this middle-aged, orange-skinned crowd that the show they are about to witness is 'the journey of my career', we know we are in for one long, lurid ride. In this sense, Tina Turner does not disappoint. Her last-ever stadium tour, currently eating up America and due to hit Britain in July, is high on entertainment value if low on taste. </p> <p>Nearly three hours long, it comes complete with 20ft flames, an enormous metallic stage, a second stage that flies out over the audience, a nine-piece backing band, three eye-popping dancers, two backing singers (one of them Gloria Reuben, who used to play Jeanie Boulet in ER), video screens flashing up archive footage, and, at the centre of it all, a 5ft 4in muscular miracle in heels as high as barstools. It's like a pop Disney World, fun and nauseating in equal parts. </p> <p>The venue is perfect. The charmingly named National Car Rental Centre, home of ice-hockey team the Florida Marlins, looks like the Royal Albert Hall bloated to three times its normal size. A large section of the car park is devoted entirely to stretch limos. In the lobby, TT T-shirts sell for $35-$55. </p> <p>By the time Turner appears, at 10pm, the crowd is already up for it, having wiggled its seats warm through a glitzy disco set by Lionel Richie. One woman in the front row holds up a banner for the entire show which reads, somewhat sweepingly: 'Scandinavia Love Tina'. Just in case anyone still imagines they are in for an introspective acoustic concert, she begins with a pumped-up version of Sly Stone's 'I Wanna Take You Higher'. This is followed by a workmanlike new song, 'Absolutely Nothing's Changed', and a sweet reprise of 'Fool In Love', the first song she ever recorded. </p> <p>But frankly it is hard to concentrate on the music when you watch Tina Turner move. Dressed in spray-on black leather knee-length pants and black leather jacket, her hairpiece so wild and woolly that it looks as if the Dulux dog is asleep on her head, she half-swaggers, half-waddles across the stage, as though she's still recovering from some fearful rectal operation. Encased in leather, her legendary thighs remain an uncomfortable-looking four inches apart throughout all her dance routines. There's always been something masochistic about Turner's wardrobe, but this is ridiculous: you feel like ringing the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Pensioners and asking them to intervene. </p> <p>The material is a true reflection of her career: raw Sixties originals ('Nutbush City Limits', 'Proud Mary'), smooth soul covers ('I Heard It Through the Grapevine', 'Try A Little Tenderness'), slick Eighties ballads ('Better Be Good To Me', 'Private Dancer'), and ugly, bombastic advertising jingles ('Simply the Best', 'Addicted to Love'). It is Turner's commercial fortune and artistic misfortune that her revival came in 1983. In the 17 years since, her music has never lost the arid, overblown feel of that era. </p> <p>Through it all, though, her voice has never really changed. Rasping and indomitable on most songs, it is infinitely more listenable on those rare occasions when she allows some vulnerability to seep into its machine-like delivery, as on a slow gospel rendition of The Beatles' 'Help'. Most of the time, though, the ruthless power and pace of this show precludes any real intimacy or soulfulness. </p> <p>Still, as a big-balled, super-charged entertainment extravaganza, Tina Turner's farewell tour cannot be faulted. At 60, she shows no signs of losing that incredible energy. Indeed, she seems almost to have too much. At one point, she interrupts her wet-nappy strut to have what looks like a silent toddler tantrum - legs and arms shaking weirdly for several seconds. Let's hope she's truly knackered by the end of this tour. Otherwise the high-street boutiques of the French Riviera are going to be hit like they've never been hit before. </p> <p>\u0095 Tina Turner plays Hampden Park, Glasgow (7 July); Millennium Stadium, Cardiff (9 July); Don Valley Stadium, Sheffield (13 July); and Wembley Stadium, London (15,16 July)</p>",

      "body": "<p>At midnight on the eve of my father's funeral there was a cool breeze blowing in his home village. Easter Sunday had been a hot, muggy day. The rains that had threatened all weekend still hadn't arrived and the village was sweltering under a clammy night. The wind rustling through the palm trees offered some respite to the crowd gathered in my father's compound for a night vigil and the traditional wake-keeping.</p> <p>Inside my father's concrete bungalow, there was an eerie, muted atmosphere. Outside, troops of Ogoni women marched around the house singing a haunting eulogy. Every now and again a masquerade or a dance troupe would emerge out of the darkness in a frenzy of colour and movement whipping up the atmosphere to the beat of thundering drummers. And still the rain held.</p> <p>As the breeze blew through the bungalow I found a quiet spot by a window and sat staring at a life-sized picture of my father perched on a table across the room. It was taken about two years before his execution on 10 November 1995. His face is slightly lopsided from the effort of keeping his pipe in the corner of his mouth. My father was never the most photogenic subject. Somehow the camera never quite caught the man I knew. He always looks too conscious of the image he is trying to project. The picture I was staring at was different though. He must have been caught off guard. As I stared at the picture, he looked to me as though he somehow knew that his life was going to end violently. I found myself wondering what was going through his mind in the last seconds before he was hanged.</p> <p>I've been over that question so many times and I've learnt to stop myself from wandering too far down that road. I kept staring at the picture, though, searching for something. It seemed so real, so lifelike that I deluded myself it was about to send me a sign, give me some reassurance that I was doing him proud. I was still looking for his approval when a fork of lightning snaked across the sky. The storm was approaching and for the next hour intermittent and spectacular bursts of lightning lit up the night.</p> <p>The eve of my father's funeral was a spectacular African night. The remnants of a full moon gave the night an opaque silvery, grey texture that silhouetted the palm trees and village against the sky. As the breeze picked up, the palm trees swayed and sighed in the wind. Small drops of rain began to fall.</p> <p>For a while it seemed we might only get a small spattering until a sustained burst scattered the crowd, drenching the singers and dancers and battering down on the corrugated aluminium roof of my father's bungalow. When I looked out onto the front porch, it seemed as if the whole of my village had massed in a huddle on the veranda.</p> <p>Bane is the home of my clan. It is one of the 120 or so Ogoni villages scattered around 404 square miles of a gently sloping floodplain on the north-eastern fringes of the Niger delta. You get there by taking the main road north out of Port Harcourt, a congested, smoke-filled city on the southern coast of Nigeria. After an hour's drive you turn off the main road and head down a road that snakes through the rainforest and into my village.</p> <p>When I returned to bury my father, it was eight years since I had last visited the village. The journey back there began in September last year when I called members of my family to a meeting in Chicago for preliminary discussions about a date for my father's funeral. According to Ogoni traditions, I, as my father's saro (eldest son), am the chief mourner and it is my duty and responsibility to bury him. Since his death he had been buried alongside the eight other men executed with him in an unmarked grave in Port Harcourt cemetery, but the return to civilian rule in Nigeria last year meant we now had the opportunity to recover his bones for a proper burial.</p> <p>My father's execution had deepened my ambivalence and heightened old anxieties about the land of my birth. I'd spent much of my teenage years and early twenties in England and I had become somewhat alienated from my culture. Although I still spoke my native language and had many fond memories of my childhood in Nigeria, I had already decided, subconsciously, at 23, that I was going to make England my home.</p> <p>Deep down, I suspect, in fact I now know, that my decision had been motivated by an intense yearning to get away from my father. Long before Ken Saro-Wiwa became a symbol of human rights and environmental activism, he had acquired a reputation as an outspoken political commentator and a trenchant, fearless critic of military rule in Nigeria. He was also well-known there as a successful self-made businessman. But his shadow ended at Nigeria's border. Outside the country I was free of it, free to be whatever I wanted to be, free to be Ken Saro-Wiwa. The fact that we shared the same name didn't trouble me in England because there, at least, it had very little currency.</p> <p>That all began to change in my late teens and early twenties once my father's shadow began to encroach on my hideaway in England. By the time he formed the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) in 1990 and the organisation began to attract attention around the world, I sensed that there was room for only one Ken Saro-Wiwa in this world. So I changed my name, dropping the Saro and hiding behind the less colourful Ken Wiwa. My father was dismayed when I told him but since he was in detention by then, there was nothing he could do about it and I gleefully signed myself short whenever I wrote to him.</p> <p>Ours was a fractious and difficult relationship. My father had been wary that I would lose touch with our roots when he sent me, my brother Gian and two sisters to private schools in England. I was sent abroad to get the 'best education that money can buy'. That education was meant to equip me to return to Nigeria to take a leadership role or at least play my part in the Ogoni community. During my teens, my father took every opportunity to impress on me that I was being groomed for a purpose. Naturally, I rebelled and spent my teenage years avoiding anything that smelled of responsibility, trying to evade the issue of having to return home to repay my dues to my father and my people.</p> <p>My father's killer, the former dictator General Sani Abacha, had been my alibi for staying away for five of the past eight years. When my father was arrested in May 1994, I decided to give up my life as a journalist in London to lead the worldwide campaign to save Ken Saro-Wiwa's life. I offered myself as a focus to his story. I slipped into the role of my father's spokesman rather too easily for my liking. I often imagine him sitting in his cell relieved that that boy of his was finally making his expensive education pay off.</p> <p>Wherever I travelled to spread the word of his predicament I regurgitated all the politics that had been drilled into me down the years. I played the role so well that many people came to see Ken Saro-Wiwa and Ken Wiwa as one and the same. Abacha was not impressed and I was placed on his wanted list should I return to Nigeria. So I became a political exile. I was delighted. Where I had struggled against a creeping shame and guilt over my decision to stay away from Nigeria, I now had a valid reason to stay away.</p> <p>Abacha's death in 1998 meant there was nowhere left to hide. It was time to return to face everything I had been running away from. It was time to face up to what it meant to be Ken Saro-Wiwa's son.</p> <p>When I emerged from Port Harcourt airport I was greeted by a crowd of about a thousand Ogonis cheering and waving ecstatically. Before I had time to take stock, I was surrounded by delirious Ogonis wearing T-shirts emblazoned with my father's name. A giant flag adorned with his picture was unfurled behind me while an activist stepped out of the crowd to recite, verbatim, my father's final statement to the tribunal that sentenced him to death. I blinked as the flashbulbs of a thousand and one cameras popped off in the early evening light.</p> <p>Welcome to Nigeria, I thought wearily as my car pulled out of the airport followed by a convoy of Ogonis who had come to witness the reincarnation of Ken Saro-Wiwa. My personal needs had been hijacked, subsumed under the higher political agenda of our people. In short, the story of my life.</p> <p>When I arrived at my father's home in the city, the house was full of friends and relatives who had come to welcome me home. I stopped briefly to greet everyone then made a beeline for my father's study. A small rectangular room, about 10 foot by six, it is packed full of documents, files, letters, books and photographs. It was where my father always retreated after a long day at the office. He would sit in there, listening to the news on World Service on his shortwave radio before writing into the early hours. He always left the door open. I would be in my room down the corridor, my door also open so that I could listen to the news blaring from the radio. The invitation to come in was clear but I never took it up. I found it hard to relax around my father and I kept my distance.</p> <p>No one had been in the study since 21 May 1994 - the night my father was arrested. Entering it was like opening a mausoleum. It was eerie discovering how many books we had in common. It dawned on me that I have unconsciously or otherwise replicated my father's working arrangements in my own home. I also have a study crammed full of books from where I spend most of my time trying to unravel the puzzle of his life and death. Many of my favourite authors were in my father's library: V.S. Naipaul; Chinua Achebe; Wole Soyinka; Ngugi Wa' Thiongo; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Ben Okri. I also found out-of-print books I had been trying to get hold of myself.</p> <p>The next morning I set out for the village. I got down from the car and walked the last quarter-mile to my father's house. People streamed out of their homes just to get a glimpse of me. It was a humbling experience. I was wary, though. I am always conscious that much, if not all of the adulation and sympathy I get is reflected glory. And that it comes with expectations.</p> <p>The joy on the faces of the Ogonis told a powerful story of a people still in mourning for my father. Everywhere I went people kept telling me how much I looked like him. It began to dawn on me that our people were desperate for a return to the kind of selfless and inspired leadership he had provided. He and I were obviously seen as an interchangeable commodity and their expectation of my homecoming was that though Ken Saro-Wiwa was dead another Ken Saro-Wiwa was ready to step in and fill the breach.</p> <p>The highlight of going back to the village was seeing my grandparents. My grandfather, Chief Jim Wiwa, is 96 years old and still going strong, although I was relieved to hear that he seems to be slowing down a little. His last child, Gibson, my great-uncle, is now seven, and he appears to be Papa's last. Papa has become something of a celebrity around here. He has been interviewed by journalists from around the world and can always be relied upon to provide a soundbite blasting the government's treatment of his son.</p> <p>Papa's face lit up like a little boy when he saw me. He had been waiting for the moment ever since my father was executed. But it was my grandmother who brought home to me what my return really meant. Frail as she was at 74 she hugged me tightly and whispered in my ear that now she had seen me she wasn't going to cry any more. It was then that I realised that my return was as much for the people I had left behind as it was about my own feelings.</p> <p>Once I satisfied everyone's need to see me, I returned to Port Harcourt to prepare for a meeting with the State Governor, Dr Peter Odili. I wrote to President Obasanjo of Nigeria last year requesting the return of my father's bones to our family and he responded warmly. But Dr Odili now told me that he had been unable to obtain the consent necessary for the exhumation from the families of the other men buried with him. We were going to have to go ahead with a symbolic burial.</p> <p>The authorities were clearly nervous about the prospect of Ken Saro-Wiwa's funeral being used as a focus for the continuing discontent in the Niger Delta. My father's championing of minority rights had greatly annoyed the \u00e9lites who have ruled Nigeria since its independence in 1960. Almost all of Nigeria's annual income of \u00a322 billion of oil is derived from petroleum or oil-related activities in the delta of the Niger but the people of the delta benefit from just 13 per cent of the revenue. My father persistently argued that the oil bearing communities deserved at least 50 per cent, especially as the money was needed to alleviate the problems caused by oil exploration.</p> <p>By sensitising Ogoni and other ethnic groups in the delta to their exploitation, Ken Saro-Wiwa came to be viewed as a threat to the status quo. The powers that be decided he had to be eliminated by any means. The circumstances leading up to his arrest, trial and execution are tangled and will, in time, surely unravel. In the meantime the \u00e9lites feared a Ken Saro-Wiwa funeral would open old wounds. But I told the Governor I was determined to keep it simple and free of all political agenda.</p> <p>After my meeting with him I returned to the village on Wednesday 19 April to begin preparations for a funeral scheduled for the following Monday. The Easter Monday date had been set since last November and my grandfather had made a public announcement to that effect in January. But a faction of Mosop had declared that my father should be buried with the eight other Ogoni martyrs at a later date chosen by a burial committee. While I sympathised with the sentiment I was incensed at not being consulted. In the end common sense prevailed and the family funeral was allowed to go ahead.</p> <p>However, by Good Friday, due to the lack of adequate communication between the village and the city, preparations still hadn't begun. We hadn't even started to dig my father's grave and the service had not been planned or organised. We didn't have a coffin, no food had been prepared, no drinks bought and my father's bungalow in the village hadn't been cleaned or painted. It would take a miracle to finish the preparations in three days. We were up against the clock and besides, it was Easter weekend. I had three sleepless nights worrying that we might not be able to give my father a befitting send off. I had nightmares that the burial would shame his memory.</p> <p>God, I guess, works in mysterious ways because by Sunday night, I was relaxed enough to sit down and contemplate what the morrow would bring.</p> <p>My grandfather and two of my uncles woke me from a short nap at dawn. I had almost observed the vigil but the lack of sleep caught up with me. At 10.30 that morning, my sister Zina led the procession out of the house holding a cross of wreaths she had helped to pluck from the forest. Behind the pall bearers, Zina's twin Noo carried the picture of my father. I followed behind, leading the family as the procession headed for the Anglican Church immediately behind my father's house.</p> <p>The crowds, already 10-deep kept a respectful distance as the procession moved to the church for an interdenominational service. It went smoothly enough considering that the order of service had only been agreed and printed on Saturday night and despite frequent interruptions from a restive crowd that had massed outside. The church was packed with clan members who had commuted from all corners of the world. In all there were about 300 of us give or take a 100 or so uninvited guests who gatecrashed the occasion in the honoured Nigerian tradition.</p> <p>After a seemingly interminable two hours, the procession moved from the church and followed a narrow dirt track to the one-acre plot that had been donated to the family by the village. Walking the 400 yards to my father's resting place was one of the most powerful experiences of my life. I struggled to contain my emotions, hiding my tears behind dark glasses and a stern expression. The route was lined with people straining to get a glimpse of the coffin and the procession.</p> <p>Such is the love and respect for my father that nothing was going to stop people from getting a glimpse of their hero's burial. The crowd massed on the fringes of a gentle sloping plot of land that had only been cleared three days before. In the middle of the field was a concrete tomb, 20 feet deep and beautifully tiled.</p> <p>As the coffin containing his pipe and two treasured books was lowered people surged to the edge of the grave. For one terrible moment it looked as if we would be swept into it by the crowd. There must have been about 5,000 people clamouring to get a better view. Scuffles and arguments broke out. It was impossible with all the shouting to hear the presiding archdeacon give the final orations. On my cue, ashes to ashes, dust to dust... I shovelled three small clumps of earth onto the coffin before retreating, fighting my way through the crowd to the bungalow for a moment of contemplation before receiving guests and condolences.</p> <p>And so my father was finally laid to rest. When his bones are finally exhumed they will be reinterred with his coffin. It seems almost futile as I now write, three days later, to try to make sense of what I have been through in the past week. So much has happened and I feel I have lived several lives. I suspect it will take time before it all falls into place. I feel somewhat empty, that I was denied the opportunity to express my grief. But I am resigned to the feeling. After all, my father was a father to everyone and perhaps it is only right to allow everyone to have shared in the occasion.</p> <p>In a week's time I will be back in Toronto where my wife Olivia is expecting our second child at any moment. Birth and death, the full cycle of life. All in the space of a month.</p> <p>But I will return here. You can never leave Africa. It infects you, inhabits your very being, waits patiently like a dutiful wife for your return. As I prepare to leave I have a distinct feeling that one life has finally come to an end and another is just beginning.</p> <p>\u0095 Ken Wiwa's memoir of his relationship with his father and his country, The Shadow of a Saint, will be published by Doubleday this autumn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At midnight on the eve of my father's funeral there was a cool breeze blowing in his home village. Easter Sunday had been a hot, muggy day. The rains that had threatened all weekend still hadn't arrived and the village was sweltering under a clammy night. The wind rustling through the palm trees offered some respite to the crowd gathered in my father's compound for a night vigil and the traditional wake-keeping. Inside my father's concrete bungalow, there was an eerie, muted atmosphere. Outside, troops of Ogoni women marched around the house singing a haunting eulogy. Every now and again a masquerade or a dance troupe would emerge out of the darkness in a frenzy of colour and movement whipping up the atmosphere to the beat of thundering drummers. And still the rain held. As the breeze blew through the bungalow I found a quiet spot by a window and sat staring at a life-sized picture of my father perched on a table across the room. It was taken about two years before his execution on 10 November 1995. His face is slightly lopsided from the effort of keeping his pipe in the corner of his mouth. My father was never the most photogenic subject. Somehow the camera never quite caught the man I knew. He always looks too conscious of the image he is trying to project. The picture I was staring at was different though. He must have been caught off guard. As I stared at the picture, he looked to me as though he somehow knew that his life was going to end violently. I found myself wondering what was going through his mind in the last seconds before he was hanged. I've been over that question so many times and I've learnt to stop myself from wandering too far down that road. I kept staring at the picture, though, searching for something. It seemed so real, so lifelike that I deluded myself it was about to send me a sign, give me some reassurance that I was doing him proud. I was still looking for his approval when a fork of lightning snaked across the sky. The storm was approaching and for the next hour intermittent and spectacular bursts of lightning lit up the night. The eve of my father's funeral was a spectacular African night. The remnants of a full moon gave the night an opaque silvery, grey texture that silhouetted the palm trees and village against the sky. As the breeze picked up, the palm trees swayed and sighed in the wind. Small drops of rain began to fall. For a while it seemed we might only get a small spattering until a sustained burst scattered the crowd, drenching the singers and dancers and battering down on the corrugated aluminium roof of my father's bungalow. When I looked out onto the front porch, it seemed as if the whole of my village had massed in a huddle on the veranda. Bane is the home of my clan. It is one of the 120 or so Ogoni villages scattered around 404 square miles of a gently sloping floodplain on the north-eastern fringes of the Niger delta. You get there by taking the main road north out of Port Harcourt, a congested, smoke-filled city on the southern coast of Nigeria. After an hour's drive you turn off the main road and head down a road that snakes through the rainforest and into my village. When I returned to bury my father, it was eight years since I had last visited the village. The journey back there began in September last year when I called members of my family to a meeting in Chicago for preliminary discussions about a date for my father's funeral. According to Ogoni traditions, I, as my father's saro (eldest son), am the chief mourner and it is my duty and responsibility to bury him. Since his death he had been buried alongside the eight other men executed with him in an unmarked grave in Port Harcourt cemetery, but the return to civilian rule in Nigeria last year meant we now had the opportunity to recover his bones for a proper burial. My father's execution had deepened my ambivalence and heightened old anxieties about the land of my birth. I'd spent much of my teenage years and early twenties in England and I had become somewhat alienated from my culture. Although I still spoke my native language and had many fond memories of my childhood in Nigeria, I had already decided, subconsciously, at 23, that I was going to make England my home. Deep down, I suspect, in fact I now know, that my decision had been motivated by an intense yearning to get away from my father. Long before Ken Saro-Wiwa became a symbol of human rights and environmental activism, he had acquired a reputation as an outspoken political commentator and a trenchant, fearless critic of military rule in Nigeria. He was also well-known there as a successful self-made businessman. But his shadow ended at Nigeria's border. Outside the country I was free of it, free to be whatever I wanted to be, free to be Ken Saro-Wiwa. The fact that we shared the same name didn't trouble me in England because there, at least, it had very little currency. That all began to change in my late teens and early twenties once my father's shadow began to encroach on my hideaway in England. By the time he formed the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop) in 1990 and the organisation began to attract attention around the world, I sensed that there was room for only one Ken Saro-Wiwa in this world. So I changed my name, dropping the Saro and hiding behind the less colourful Ken Wiwa. My father was dismayed when I told him but since he was in detention by then, there was nothing he could do about it and I gleefully signed myself short whenever I wrote to him. Ours was a fractious and difficult relationship. My father had been wary that I would lose touch with our roots when he sent me, my brother Gian and two sisters to private schools in England. I was sent abroad to get the 'best education that money can buy'. That education was meant to equip me to return to Nigeria to take a leadership role or at least play my part in the Ogoni community. During my teens, my father took every opportunity to impress on me that I was being groomed for a purpose. Naturally, I rebelled and spent my teenage years avoiding anything that smelled of responsibility, trying to evade the issue of having to return home to repay my dues to my father and my people. My father's killer, the former dictator General Sani Abacha, had been my alibi for staying away for five of the past eight years. When my father was arrested in May 1994, I decided to give up my life as a journalist in London to lead the worldwide campaign to save Ken Saro-Wiwa's life. I offered myself as a focus to his story. I slipped into the role of my father's spokesman rather too easily for my liking. I often imagine him sitting in his cell relieved that that boy of his was finally making his expensive education pay off. Wherever I travelled to spread the word of his predicament I regurgitated all the politics that had been drilled into me down the years. I played the role so well that many people came to see Ken Saro-Wiwa and Ken Wiwa as one and the same. Abacha was not impressed and I was placed on his wanted list should I return to Nigeria. So I became a political exile. I was delighted. Where I had struggled against a creeping shame and guilt over my decision to stay away from Nigeria, I now had a valid reason to stay away. Abacha's death in 1998 meant there was nowhere left to hide. It was time to return to face everything I had been running away from. It was time to face up to what it meant to be Ken Saro-Wiwa's son. When I emerged from Port Harcourt airport I was greeted by a crowd of about a thousand Ogonis cheering and waving ecstatically. Before I had time to take stock, I was surrounded by delirious Ogonis wearing T-shirts emblazoned with my father's name. A giant flag adorned with his picture was unfurled behind me while an activist stepped out of the crowd to recite, verbatim, my father's final statement to the tribunal that sentenced him to death. I blinked as the flashbulbs of a thousand and one cameras popped off in the early evening light. Welcome to Nigeria, I thought wearily as my car pulled out of the airport followed by a convoy of Ogonis who had come to witness the reincarnation of Ken Saro-Wiwa. My personal needs had been hijacked, subsumed under the higher political agenda of our people. In short, the story of my life. When I arrived at my father's home in the city, the house was full of friends and relatives who had come to welcome me home. I stopped briefly to greet everyone then made a beeline for my father's study. A small rectangular room, about 10 foot by six, it is packed full of documents, files, letters, books and photographs. It was where my father always retreated after a long day at the office. He would sit in there, listening to the news on World Service on his shortwave radio before writing into the early hours. He always left the door open. I would be in my room down the corridor, my door also open so that I could listen to the news blaring from the radio. The invitation to come in was clear but I never took it up. I found it hard to relax around my father and I kept my distance. No one had been in the study since 21 May 1994 - the night my father was arrested. Entering it was like opening a mausoleum. It was eerie discovering how many books we had in common. It dawned on me that I have unconsciously or otherwise replicated my father's working arrangements in my own home. I also have a study crammed full of books from where I spend most of my time trying to unravel the puzzle of his life and death. Many of my favourite authors were in my father's library: V.S. Naipaul; Chinua Achebe; Wole Soyinka; Ngugi Wa' Thiongo; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nadine Gordimer and Ben Okri. I also found out-of-print books I had been trying to get hold of myself. The next morning I set out for the village. I got down from the car and walked the last quarter-mile to my father's house. People streamed out of their homes just to get a glimpse of me. It was a humbling experience. I was wary, though. I am always conscious that much, if not all of the adulation and sympathy I get is reflected glory. And that it comes with expectations. The joy on the faces of the Ogonis told a powerful story of a people still in mourning for my father. Everywhere I went people kept telling me how much I looked like him. It began to dawn on me that our people were desperate for a return to the kind of selfless and inspired leadership he had provided. He and I were obviously seen as an interchangeable commodity and their expectation of my homecoming was that though Ken Saro-Wiwa was dead another Ken Saro-Wiwa was ready to step in and fill the breach. The highlight of going back to the village was seeing my grandparents. My grandfather, Chief Jim Wiwa, is 96 years old and still going strong, although I was relieved to hear that he seems to be slowing down a little. His last child, Gibson, my great-uncle, is now seven, and he appears to be Papa's last. Papa has become something of a celebrity around here. He has been interviewed by journalists from around the world and can always be relied upon to provide a soundbite blasting the government's treatment of his son. Papa's face lit up like a little boy when he saw me. He had been waiting for the moment ever since my father was executed. But it was my grandmother who brought home to me what my return really meant. Frail as she was at 74 she hugged me tightly and whispered in my ear that now she had seen me she wasn't going to cry any more. It was then that I realised that my return was as much for the people I had left behind as it was about my own feelings. Once I satisfied everyone's need to see me, I returned to Port Harcourt to prepare for a meeting with the State Governor, Dr Peter Odili. I wrote to President Obasanjo of Nigeria last year requesting the return of my father's bones to our family and he responded warmly. But Dr Odili now told me that he had been unable to obtain the consent necessary for the exhumation from the families of the other men buried with him. We were going to have to go ahead with a symbolic burial. The authorities were clearly nervous about the prospect of Ken Saro-Wiwa's funeral being used as a focus for the continuing discontent in the Niger Delta. My father's championing of minority rights had greatly annoyed the \u00e9lites who have ruled Nigeria since its independence in 1960. Almost all of Nigeria's annual income of \u00a322 billion of oil is derived from petroleum or oil-related activities in the delta of the Niger but the people of the delta benefit from just 13 per cent of the revenue. My father persistently argued that the oil bearing communities deserved at least 50 per cent, especially as the money was needed to alleviate the problems caused by oil exploration. By sensitising Ogoni and other ethnic groups in the delta to their exploitation, Ken Saro-Wiwa came to be viewed as a threat to the status quo. The powers that be decided he had to be eliminated by any means. The circumstances leading up to his arrest, trial and execution are tangled and will, in time, surely unravel. In the meantime the \u00e9lites feared a Ken Saro-Wiwa funeral would open old wounds. But I told the Governor I was determined to keep it simple and free of all political agenda. After my meeting with him I returned to the village on Wednesday 19 April to begin preparations for a funeral scheduled for the following Monday. The Easter Monday date had been set since last November and my grandfather had made a public announcement to that effect in January. But a faction of Mosop had declared that my father should be buried with the eight other Ogoni martyrs at a later date chosen by a burial committee. While I sympathised with the sentiment I was incensed at not being consulted. In the end common sense prevailed and the family funeral was allowed to go ahead. However, by Good Friday, due to the lack of adequate communication between the village and the city, preparations still hadn't begun. We hadn't even started to dig my father's grave and the service had not been planned or organised. We didn't have a coffin, no food had been prepared, no drinks bought and my father's bungalow in the village hadn't been cleaned or painted. It would take a miracle to finish the preparations in three days. We were up against the clock and besides, it was Easter weekend. I had three sleepless nights worrying that we might not be able to give my father a befitting send off. I had nightmares that the burial would shame his memory. God, I guess, works in mysterious ways because by Sunday night, I was relaxed enough to sit down and contemplate what the morrow would bring. My grandfather and two of my uncles woke me from a short nap at dawn. I had almost observed the vigil but the lack of sleep caught up with me. At 10.30 that morning, my sister Zina led the procession out of the house holding a cross of wreaths she had helped to pluck from the forest. Behind the pall bearers, Zina's twin Noo carried the picture of my father. I followed behind, leading the family as the procession headed for the Anglican Church immediately behind my father's house. The crowds, already 10-deep kept a respectful distance as the procession moved to the church for an interdenominational service. It went smoothly enough considering that the order of service had only been agreed and printed on Saturday night and despite frequent interruptions from a restive crowd that had massed outside. The church was packed with clan members who had commuted from all corners of the world. In all there were about 300 of us give or take a 100 or so uninvited guests who gatecrashed the occasion in the honoured Nigerian tradition. After a seemingly interminable two hours, the procession moved from the church and followed a narrow dirt track to the one-acre plot that had been donated to the family by the village. Walking the 400 yards to my father's resting place was one of the most powerful experiences of my life. I struggled to contain my emotions, hiding my tears behind dark glasses and a stern expression. The route was lined with people straining to get a glimpse of the coffin and the procession. Such is the love and respect for my father that nothing was going to stop people from getting a glimpse of their hero's burial. The crowd massed on the fringes of a gentle sloping plot of land that had only been cleared three days before. In the middle of the field was a concrete tomb, 20 feet deep and beautifully tiled. As the coffin containing his pipe and two treasured books was lowered people surged to the edge of the grave. For one terrible moment it looked as if we would be swept into it by the crowd. There must have been about 5,000 people clamouring to get a better view. Scuffles and arguments broke out. It was impossible with all the shouting to hear the presiding archdeacon give the final orations. On my cue, ashes to ashes, dust to dust... I shovelled three small clumps of earth onto the coffin before retreating, fighting my way through the crowd to the bungalow for a moment of contemplation before receiving guests and condolences. And so my father was finally laid to rest. When his bones are finally exhumed they will be reinterred with his coffin. It seems almost futile as I now write, three days later, to try to make sense of what I have been through in the past week. So much has happened and I feel I have lived several lives. I suspect it will take time before it all falls into place. I feel somewhat empty, that I was denied the opportunity to express my grief. But I am resigned to the feeling. After all, my father was a father to everyone and perhaps it is only right to allow everyone to have shared in the occasion. In a week's time I will be back in Toronto where my wife Olivia is expecting our second child at any moment. Birth and death, the full cycle of life. All in the space of a month. But I will return here. You can never leave Africa. It infects you, inhabits your very being, waits patiently like a dutiful wife for your return. As I prepare to leave I have a distinct feeling that one life has finally come to an end and another is just beginning. \u0095 Ken Wiwa's memoir of his relationship with his father and his country, The Shadow of a Saint, will be published by Doubleday this autumn.",

We've become friends of a sort, the way people do when they work together on a challenging but rewarding and endless task. You discover something new in yourself, and in the others. We have an annual Christmas party. Sean calls it a 'yogic feast', only half-joking. It starts in mid-evening with champagne in a Hampstead pub and slaloms down the hill - and downhill - from there, winding up as the winter dawn greys the horizon. 'Oh yes,' joked Kirk. 'Be frightened. Be very frightened of the Yoga Crew.' Sean McCarthy (instructor) 020 7923 3520. The Sir Richard Steele, 97 Haverstock Hill, London NW3 (020 7483 1261)",

Sitting round a huge table in the bowels of the National Theatre, actors about to play Hitler, Himmler, Eva Braun and the stage army of the Third Reich were debating the plausibility of Hitler's Minister of Armaments not knowing about what was happening to Jews and others in the slave-labour and death camps of the Nazi empire.</p> <p>Suddenly, the argument escalated. Albert Speer was Hitler's favourite. As his architect, he had been a vital part of the Nazi propaganda machine. As his armourer, he was responsible for millions of slave-workers kept in unspeakable conditions. He kept the war going for a year longer than it needed to, at the cost of untold suffering. Whatever he knew or didn't know, did Speer have a case worth presenting? Was it worth us doing a play about this man at all?</p> <p>This was not the first time this question had come up. It had been central to the discussions I had had with the play's director Trevor Nunn during its development. And for both of us there was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: the same debate had raged around a play I wrote about the rise of the National Front in Seventies Britain, which Trevor programmed for the RSC in 1976. By seeking to understand people with dreadful opinions, or people complicit in crimes resulting from those opinions, is the writer (or director or actor) inevitably tending to condone?</p> <p>The first immediate, instinctive response in this case is that the play Albert Speer is based on a well-reviewed, highly regarded and massively successful biography by Gitta Sereny, whose moral credentials and dignity of purpose were questioned by no one.</p> <p>However, this argument falls apart when the material is transferred to the theatre. However passionate its author, a work of history has an essentially magisterial relationship with its readership. Like the French legal system, the medium invites sober consideration of the evidence, the balancing of arguments and the disinterested search for truth. Like a British courtroom, a play tends to the adversarial, demanding that the jury identify with one side.</p> <p>In this case, there is no sober summing-up of the evidence, many of the prosecution witnesses are dead, and the accused is conducting his own defence. And however critical we may be of him and it, are we not - by the very act of presenting it - implying that he has a case? Or - even more insidiously - that his moral anguish can be set against the suffering for which he has been held responsible?</p> <p>Further, we are aware that we're telling this story at a moment when the history of the Second World War is a matter of acute and current political contest. However unambiguous Mr Justice Gray's finding may have been, the Irving trial reminded everyone how much of the darkest events of the war are subject to interpretation, how deep is the controversy about the aims and history of the Holocaust, and how much of our knowledge of it is based on essentially circumstantial evidence.</p> <p>And we are exploring the case for and against a leading Nazi at a time when the supposed effects of writing are subject to unprecedented scrutiny. Not only are works of fiction cited as inspiring, if not causing, real-life crimes (the 'go thou and do likewise' theory of literary influence) but works of non-fiction are called to account for the harm or even distress they might cause. Following the publication of her 1998 book about the Mary Bell case, Cries Unheard, Gitta Sereny herself was accused by the parents of Mary's victims of 'bringing up all the bad memories'.</p> <p>From this understandable concern with the feelings of people involved in tragedies, it has proved a short step to the argument advanced by a reader protesting against the serialisation of Gordon Burns's book about Frederick and Rosemary West in the Guardian on the grounds of the 'suffering, despair and pain involved in the subject matter', not for the relatives of West's victims, but for everyone. And both Marcus Harvey's painting of and Diane Dubois's play about the continuing iconic influence of Myra Hindley were condemned on the grounds that it was inappropriate to treat of her in art at all.</p> <p>And yet - of course - if the subject of evil was removed from the dramatic canon, most of the great tragedies would disappear from the repertoire. From Clytemnestra and Oedipus via Richard III, Macbeth and Othello to the gangsters, gunslingers and Godfathers of twentieth-century cinema, great drama has always been obsessed with killers, natural born and otherwise. If it was really true that the purpose of drama is to encourage its audiences to imitate the behaviour of its protagonists, then the medium has a great deal to answer for.</p> <p>But, sadly, the opposite view - that the point of drama is precisely to discourage such behaviour by showing how it will inevitably get its comeuppance - doesn't really wash. 'Don't do this at home' is as misleading a description of what drama counsels us as 'go thou and do likewise'. The awful truth - and it is awful, in both senses of the word - is that the response most great drama asks of us is neither 'yes please' nor 'no thanks' but 'you too?'. Or, in the cold light of dawn, 'there but for the grace of God go I'.</p> <p>When, understandably but sadly, the parents of Mary Bell's victims wrote in the Sun that 'Mary Bell is not worthy of consideration as a feeling human being', they were letting the rest of us off the hook. The notion that there is a thing called evil which separates the wicked off from the rest of us is a comforting illusion. The uncomfortable truth is that to understand does involve recognition and even empathy. It does require seeing the world through the eyes of the wicked person, and thus finding those impulses and resentments and fears within ourselves that could - we painfully have to admit - drive us to commit dreadful acts under different circumstances.</p> <p>As Peter Brook writes in The Empty Space, 'in the theatre the slate is wiped clean all the time'. Drama is a test-bed on which we can test and confront our darkest impulses under laboratory conditions; where we can experience the desires without having to confront the consequences. Drama enables us to peer into the soul, not of the person who has driven his father out onto the heath, but the person who has wanted to.</p> <p>But that's only the first shock.

But the problem with looking in a mirror is that you see what the world sees.

      "body": "<p>On a grassy knoll above the remote village of Kabumba, about 120 miles west of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, is a small Catholic church built out of locally baked red bricks. Geckos flick over the iron roof and cows carefully crop the long grass around the base of its scrubbed walls. The sky is wide and open over the rolling hills. It was built, in 1984, by Joseph Kibwetere, a local landowner and businessman, one-time government minister, lay preacher, devout Catholic and father of eight.</p> <p> Quite how Kibwetere the respected pillar of the local church became Kibwetere the heretic mass murderer is not entirely clear. He was born in 1936 and raised in a devout Catholic family. He inherited some land and started a number of successful businesses. He embarked on a political career and by the 70s, under Idi Amin's lunatic rule, had risen to be head of the government's public works commission. Then came disappointment. When Amin was ousted, Kibwetere lost his political position and much of his fortune. It was a bitter blow. He retired to land he had bought in the west of Uganda and sought solace in the church and his faith. </p> <p> Kibwetere's money and previous political activity soon earned him respect. His reputation for piety was, by all accounts, well earned. His children describe their father's insistence on church attendance, rosaries before they slept at night and prayer meetings before they went to school. Kibwetere's house is only a few hundred yards from the church he built. His estranged wife, Theresa, and several of his six surviving children still live there. It is a low bungalow surrounded by bougainvillea and umbrella trees, and is reached up a winding track lined with hibiscus. Giles, Kibwetere's son, is keen to talk about his father. The interview is hardly a global exclusive - 38 other journalists have signed themselves into the family's 'visitor's book'.</p> <p> Giles, 36, says, no doubt for the 39th time, how shocked and surprised he is and how his father was a good man who was led astray. We sit in the family's front room on wooden chairs covered with red plastic. It is modest and clean, and there are perhaps 30 separate images of Christ, the saints or the Virgin Mary on the walls. In one corner is a 3ft, painted baked-clay Madonna.</p> <p> After a few minutes, Theresa, Kibwetere's ex-wife, joins us. She has just returned from church and is still wearing her best outfit - a floral-print dress and an orange headscarf. She has two Madonna and child pendants around her neck and a watch with a Madonna and child face. I tell her she looks very smart, and she cackles and shakes her head. I know from local press cuttings that she joined the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments at its inception and that her home was the cult's base from 1989 to 1993, when she had them expelled by the authorities. I ask her how she and her husband first came to be involved. 'It was in 1989,' she says quietly, and I have to move closer to her as the rain hammers off the tin roof above us. Her English is soft and has a rhythm learned from years of Bible study. </p> <p> 'We used to read in papers [religious pamphlets] of messages from heaven, and we were learning from them what our blessed mother in heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ were saying to the world, and we were sad because it had not happened here. We were good Catholics, as we had been raised to be and had been all our lives.</p> <p> And then something that we thought was a miracle happened. In that year, a woman came to see us who said that she had got messages from heaven. And then she said that our Lady told her that a man called Joseph would come, and that when he came people should follow him to his home. Can you imagine how we felt? Our blessed mother had sent a message with my husband's name. And her name was Credonia, and we believed what she said was true.' </p> <p> She pauses and smooths down the dress with long, delicate fingers. 'So in July of that year the woman called Credonia came here to our home, and she went out preaching, and soon many more people came, and by the end of the year there were more than 200 of them living here and all praying all the time, and Credonia slept in the same room as me and Joseph, and for a time we were very happy.' </p> <p> She pauses again. 'But things began to change. My husband was always a cheerful man and loving to his children, but soon he started striking them. The woman [Credonia] said schools were bad, so all my children were taken out of class and then they were mistreated and not given enough food, and there was a time when my youngest daughter ran away and she came back and she was so bitterly beaten by this woman that she was bleeding from her nose and her mouth, and another daughter was beaten, too. And we sold lots of our land and our vehicle and our fridge and our cooker, and all the money was given to Credonia. And even I was disrespected, and one morning I went out and all my clothes had been burned, and I called my husband and he just looked and walked away.</p> <p> 'Finally, in 1993, my son went to the authorities and all of them were made to leave, and that is when they went to Kanungu, and my husband went with them, and they said they were going to build an ark to go to heaven, but instead they all died, and that woman will go to hell because this is the work of Satan.' She crosses herself carefully.</p> <p> 'It was all Credonia,' she says. 'My husband was just a token for her because she needed some respectability, and my husband was very respectable here. We tried to persuade him to come back to us, but he did not come. I have not seen him for so many years. The woman used to call herself \"The Programmer\". Whatever she said, people did. She was sent by the Satan. She came to us and we believed her, and I was led astray by the Evil one, but I am a good Catholic and I was born a Catholic and will die a Catholic.'</p> <p>On 24 August 1989 - a month after she had told Joseph Kibwetere that the Virgin Mary had told her to seek him out and live in his house - Credonia Mwerinde and her husband, Eric Mazima, had the last of a series of fierce arguments. Mwerinde, then 37, had told Mazima that she had seen the face of the Virgin Mary on a rock in a cave nearby. Mazima, a grizzled labourer, told her she was talking rubbish. She said she would leave him. He told her she wanted to go back to being a prostitute. She walked out, took a local taxi over to Kabumba, and within a few days had set her self up with Joseph and Theresa Kibwetere. </p> <p> Mwerinde grew up on her father's small farm in the remote village of Kanungu - about a two-hour drive west of Kabumba. Though heavily farmed, the hills are steep, and the fields and plantations are studded with patches of thick and fetid undergrowth. From the higher ridges, the mountains of the Ruwenzori, Rwanda and the Congo can be seen to the west like a dark, smudged pencil line drawn along the horizon. The village is dominated by a sizeable red-brick Catholic church - the biggest building for miles. Not far away is the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest (bwindi means 'dark' or 'black' in the local language), where eight tourists, including four Britons, were abducted and murdered last year. Though the land around Kanungu was cleared decades ago, it feels eerie - as if the jungle was only hacked away last week. </p> <p> Mwerinde had two sisters and three brothers. She completed two years at a local Catholic missionary school, according to locals in Kanungu, but left still using her thumbprint as a signature. She spent her teenage years helping her parents in their fields and then worked as a housegirl for a businessman who lived nearby. For 10 years she ran a local shebeen in a rented hut in Kanungu, serving up banana-based hooch for two shillings a flask. She did not join the 90 per cent of the local community in church on Sundays but kept her bar open, jeering at the faithful. Local people remember that she could 'twist men round her fingers' and say that she was prone to sudden violence. To supplement her income, she sold herself and married one of her clients, Mazima, in 1981. </p> <p> By the late 80s her bar was failing and she was unpopular in the village. She needed another way of making a living. Throughout the 80s the Ugandan newspapers were full of stories of born-again Christian churches and their bizarre evangelical offshoots. Every week, it seemed, new prophets were springing up, tapping into Uganda's rich millenarian tradition and often making a large amount of money. Mwerinde had always been able to manipulate people and, locals admit, she had a certain malign charisma. To lead a cult would mean power, money and prestige - none of which she had ever had. But she recognised that in rural Uganda's conservative and religious society, she would need a figurehead to give her group legitimacy. She knew of Joseph Kibwetere by reputation. He was pious and wealthy and, it was said, somewhat lacking in self-esteem, perhaps a little weak, a little vulnerable. By the end of 1990, Mwerinde was comfortably installed at Kibwetere's house.</p> <p> By the time she was expelled from the Kabumba house in 1993, she had a sizeable following. She inherited her family's land when her father died in 1991 and installed the group there. Mwerinde outlined her creed in a book called A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Times. Though most of the book is written with Old Testament enthusiasm - she tells how 'the Lord has told me that hurricanes of fire would rain forth from heaven and spread over those who would not have repented' - much of the book appears to owe more to Idi Amin at his maddest than to Isaiah.</p> <p> Mwerinde established an unremitting routine of hard physical labour, marathon prayer sessions and inadequate food and sleep. The cult's liturgy was an extraordinary fusion of Ugandan Catholicism, Pentecostal evangelism, apocalyptic doom-mongering and local superstition. Cult members were working to be 'redeemed' when the great 'sift' came. They had to guard against constant temptation - not least by evil local spirits. Only the strictest adherence to Mwerinde's codes could ensure salvation. </p> <p> The cult members slept on thin papyrus mats packed into overcrowded dormitories. Men were segregated from women, and sex was forbidden. Everyone had to wear green and white gowns. All conversation was banned. Medication was forbidden - even when children started dying of measles - and no visitors were allowed into the main compound. Discipline was maintained with fierce beatings. The leaders lived apart with better food and lodging. Mwerinde, who was usually seen in flowing white robes with a gold cross around her neck, got fat over the 11 years she ran the cult. </p> <p> Life was grim. 'Monday and Friday were strictly for fasting,' Besigye Emmanuel, once a carpenter at the cult's church, says. 'The rest of the days we'd get a bowl of porridge or some maize and millet bread for lunch, but that was all. We'd get up at dawn and work in the fields until it was dark, with an hour off at noon. Then we'd pray and sing until midnight.' </p> <p>Mwerinde used a variety of means to separate cult members from their cash.

Until the early 80s, Kataribabo had been a good Catholic priest working his way up the church hierarchy. He was bright and ambitious. But a nasty and complex political wrangle with rivals for senior positions in the church saw him exiled to the small parish church in the village of Rugazi. There are parallels with Kibwetere's fall from political grace at around the same time.</p> <p> By 1990, he was in touch with Mwerinde. By 1993, he had been reported to the archbishop in Kampala for his claims that he had a 'direct' route to God bypassing the pope and the church. He was excommunicated from the priesthood, though he continued preaching. </p> <p> Almost all the bodies found at Kataribabo's home had been hacked with machetes, strangled and bludgeoned to death. So had the 153 bodies found at a cult-owned farm in nearby Buhunga village, as well as the 81 buried at another cult member's house in the town of Rushojwa. Some appear to have been poisoned with a pesticide, Dithane. Six battered corpses, doused with acid, were found under the leaders' living quarters at Kanungu. Even without the church fire, it would have been a holocaust. </p> <p> Nobody yet knows what happened to spark the murders - no one was killed before the start of this year - but the police believe they were motivated by greed. </p> <p> As chiliastic leaders the world over found to their chagrin, the world did not end at midnight on 31 December 1999. This posed a problem to the leaders of the Kanungu cult, because they had predicated most of their teachings on an ascent to heaven with the coming of the new year. The cult members would escape an apocalyptic flood, they said, when the Lord sent a chariot of fire to rescue them, and neither had materialised. To start with, Mwerinde was unworried. Confident of her cult members' trust - and her brutal regime's success in cowing them - she merely announced that she had been told by Christ that Judgment Day had been rescheduled for 31 March. But her confidence appears to have been misplaced, and scores of disappointed cult members began to get restive. Some demanded their money back. The most vociferous tended to be the younger men. They were the first to die. </p> <p> Quite how they died is unclear. According to some reports, the cult's farm manager at Kanungu - a giant of a man called Robert Kanangura - was the chief executioner. But he could not have murdered 400 or more people alone. Instead, it seems likely that a group of the most devoted of the cult members carried out the killings. The victims would have been summoned to a personal audience with Mwerinde - a great honour - and then hacked to death. The rule of silence would have prevented any loose talk in the compound and, as cult members were frequently moved between sites, suspicions would have been limited. </p> <p> But the leaders knew that convincing their followers of any further celestial reschedulings would be impossible. The movement would collapse when the March deadline passed. Though Mwerinde and the others could easily have slipped away one night, they instead decided to squeeze the cult for all they could get. They decided to recruit as many people as they could, take their property and then kill them. </p> <p> Sometime in January, the half-literate former prostitute, the frustrated politician and the failed priest must have sat down and decided to murder as many people as they possibly could - in the event, more than 1,000 - for their money. </p> <p> In early February, they launched a recruitment drive. A series of radio advertisements were broadcast throughout western Uganda. The national radio station was even approached about a wider campaign. Thousands of leaflets were distributed and scores of ex-members received personal visits from the cult leaders. This is it, they were told, this is your last chance for eternal peace and salvation. </p> <p> By early March, preparations were well underway. Kataribabo bought several dozen litres of sulphuric acid from a store in Rukengiri. Several large jerry cans full of petrol were bought. All cult members were told to sell off their property and burn whatever was left. Livestock and equipment at the Kanungu farm were sold off at knockdown prices. And the taxis full of those answering the call of the leaflets and the advertisements kept pulling up at the cult's headquarters.</p> <p> Late on the evening of 16 March, Kibwetere appeared at the local police post, which had neither telephone nor vehicles. He handed over the Movement's articles of registration and land titles. Up at their compound, an unprecedented celebration was underway. Cattle had been slaughtered and roasted over fires and soft drinks distributed. At midnight, up to 550 people trooped into the church. Its windows were nailed shut - to keep out the coming floods. The church was an ark that would take them to heaven. They prayed, sang and chanted through the night. Around 8am, according to witnesses, a group of cult members emerged from the church and rounded up children who had been playing in the flowerbeds outside. The doors of the building were then nailed shut from the inside. The entire congregation smeared themselves in 'Nightrose' - a highly inflammable oil - and then lit candles. At their head stood the giant farm manager. From physical evidence retrieved by investigators it appears that he ignited - possibly with a flaming torch - one of the barrels full of petrol that stood in each corner. Around 550 people, including 78 children, were incinerated within moments.</p> <p>The Ugandan police have stopped digging for bodies. They admit there are probably many more to be found, but say they simply don't have the resources to deal with any more corpses. The death toll already exceeds that of the Jim Jones's mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978, so what's the point in excavating more, they say. They have made one not particularly impressive arrest. The Reverend Richard Mutazendwa, a Kanungu official who is alleged to have accepted gifts of cattle and cash from the cult in return for deflecting the attention of suspicious government inspectors, is now languishing in prison. </p> <p> Credonia Mwerinde, Joseph Kibwetere and Father Dominic Kataribabo are still at large. There is an Interpol alert out for them, but few are hopeful that they will be brought to justice. The cults' main vehicle - a blue Toyota pick-up truck - disappeared on the night of the blaze and has only been seen once since: in a small village close to the border with Rwanda and the Congo.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a grassy knoll above the remote village of Kabumba, about 120 miles west of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, is a small Catholic church built out of locally baked red bricks. Geckos flick over the iron roof and cows carefully crop the long grass around the base of its scrubbed walls. The sky is wide and open over the rolling hills. It was built, in 1984, by Joseph Kibwetere, a local landowner and businessman, one-time government minister, lay preacher, devout Catholic and father of eight. Quite how Kibwetere the respected pillar of the local church became Kibwetere the heretic mass murderer is not entirely clear. He was born in 1936 and raised in a devout Catholic family. He inherited some land and started a number of successful businesses. He embarked on a political career and by the 70s, under Idi Amin's lunatic rule, had risen to be head of the government's public works commission. Then came disappointment. When Amin was ousted, Kibwetere lost his political position and much of his fortune. It was a bitter blow. He retired to land he had bought in the west of Uganda and sought solace in the church and his faith. Kibwetere's money and previous political activity soon earned him respect. His reputation for piety was, by all accounts, well earned. His children describe their father's insistence on church attendance, rosaries before they slept at night and prayer meetings before they went to school. Kibwetere's house is only a few hundred yards from the church he built. His estranged wife, Theresa, and several of his six surviving children still live there. It is a low bungalow surrounded by bougainvillea and umbrella trees, and is reached up a winding track lined with hibiscus. Giles, Kibwetere's son, is keen to talk about his father. The interview is hardly a global exclusive - 38 other journalists have signed themselves into the family's 'visitor's book'. Giles, 36, says, no doubt for the 39th time, how shocked and surprised he is and how his father was a good man who was led astray. We sit in the family's front room on wooden chairs covered with red plastic. It is modest and clean, and there are perhaps 30 separate images of Christ, the saints or the Virgin Mary on the walls. In one corner is a 3ft, painted baked-clay Madonna. After a few minutes, Theresa, Kibwetere's ex-wife, joins us. She has just returned from church and is still wearing her best outfit - a floral-print dress and an orange headscarf. She has two Madonna and child pendants around her neck and a watch with a Madonna and child face. I tell her she looks very smart, and she cackles and shakes her head. I know from local press cuttings that she joined the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments at its inception and that her home was the cult's base from 1989 to 1993, when she had them expelled by the authorities. I ask her how she and her husband first came to be involved. 'It was in 1989,' she says quietly, and I have to move closer to her as the rain hammers off the tin roof above us. Her English is soft and has a rhythm learned from years of Bible study. 'We used to read in papers [religious pamphlets] of messages from heaven, and we were learning from them what our blessed mother in heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ were saying to the world, and we were sad because it had not happened here. We were good Catholics, as we had been raised to be and had been all our lives. And then something that we thought was a miracle happened. In that year, a woman came to see us who said that she had got messages from heaven. And then she said that our Lady told her that a man called Joseph would come, and that when he came people should follow him to his home. Can you imagine how we felt? Our blessed mother had sent a message with my husband's name. And her name was Credonia, and we believed what she said was true.' She pauses and smooths down the dress with long, delicate fingers. 'So in July of that year the woman called Credonia came here to our home, and she went out preaching, and soon many more people came, and by the end of the year there were more than 200 of them living here and all praying all the time, and Credonia slept in the same room as me and Joseph, and for a time we were very happy.' She pauses again. 'But things began to change. My husband was always a cheerful man and loving to his children, but soon he started striking them. The woman [Credonia] said schools were bad, so all my children were taken out of class and then they were mistreated and not given enough food, and there was a time when my youngest daughter ran away and she came back and she was so bitterly beaten by this woman that she was bleeding from her nose and her mouth, and another daughter was beaten, too. And we sold lots of our land and our vehicle and our fridge and our cooker, and all the money was given to Credonia. And even I was disrespected, and one morning I went out and all my clothes had been burned, and I called my husband and he just looked and walked away. 'Finally, in 1993, my son went to the authorities and all of them were made to leave, and that is when they went to Kanungu, and my husband went with them, and they said they were going to build an ark to go to heaven, but instead they all died, and that woman will go to hell because this is the work of Satan.' She crosses herself carefully. 'It was all Credonia,' she says. 'My husband was just a token for her because she needed some respectability, and my husband was very respectable here. We tried to persuade him to come back to us, but he did not come. I have not seen him for so many years. The woman used to call herself \"The Programmer\". Whatever she said, people did. She was sent by the Satan. She came to us and we believed her, and I was led astray by the Evil one, but I am a good Catholic and I was born a Catholic and will die a Catholic.' On 24 August 1989 - a month after she had told Joseph Kibwetere that the Virgin Mary had told her to seek him out and live in his house - Credonia Mwerinde and her husband, Eric Mazima, had the last of a series of fierce arguments. Mwerinde, then 37, had told Mazima that she had seen the face of the Virgin Mary on a rock in a cave nearby. Mazima, a grizzled labourer, told her she was talking rubbish. She said she would leave him. He told her she wanted to go back to being a prostitute. She walked out, took a local taxi over to Kabumba, and within a few days had set her self up with Joseph and Theresa Kibwetere. Mwerinde grew up on her father's small farm in the remote village of Kanungu - about a two-hour drive west of Kabumba. Though heavily farmed, the hills are steep, and the fields and plantations are studded with patches of thick and fetid undergrowth. From the higher ridges, the mountains of the Ruwenzori, Rwanda and the Congo can be seen to the west like a dark, smudged pencil line drawn along the horizon. The village is dominated by a sizeable red-brick Catholic church - the biggest building for miles. Not far away is the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest (bwindi means 'dark' or 'black' in the local language), where eight tourists, including four Britons, were abducted and murdered last year. Though the land around Kanungu was cleared decades ago, it feels eerie - as if the jungle was only hacked away last week. Mwerinde had two sisters and three brothers. She completed two years at a local Catholic missionary school, according to locals in Kanungu, but left still using her thumbprint as a signature. She spent her teenage years helping her parents in their fields and then worked as a housegirl for a businessman who lived nearby. For 10 years she ran a local shebeen in a rented hut in Kanungu, serving up banana-based hooch for two shillings a flask. She did not join the 90 per cent of the local community in church on Sundays but kept her bar open, jeering at the faithful. Local people remember that she could 'twist men round her fingers' and say that she was prone to sudden violence. To supplement her income, she sold herself and married one of her clients, Mazima, in 1981. By the late 80s her bar was failing and she was unpopular in the village. She needed another way of making a living. Throughout the 80s the Ugandan newspapers were full of stories of born-again Christian churches and their bizarre evangelical offshoots. Every week, it seemed, new prophets were springing up, tapping into Uganda's rich millenarian tradition and often making a large amount of money. Mwerinde had always been able to manipulate people and, locals admit, she had a certain malign charisma. To lead a cult would mean power, money and prestige - none of which she had ever had. But she recognised that in rural Uganda's conservative and religious society, she would need a figurehead to give her group legitimacy. She knew of Joseph Kibwetere by reputation. He was pious and wealthy and, it was said, somewhat lacking in self-esteem, perhaps a little weak, a little vulnerable. By the end of 1990, Mwerinde was comfortably installed at Kibwetere's house. By the time she was expelled from the Kabumba house in 1993, she had a sizeable following. She inherited her family's land when her father died in 1991 and installed the group there. Mwerinde outlined her creed in a book called A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Times. Though most of the book is written with Old Testament enthusiasm - she tells how 'the Lord has told me that hurricanes of fire would rain forth from heaven and spread over those who would not have repented' - much of the book appears to owe more to Idi Amin at his maddest than to Isaiah. Mwerinde established an unremitting routine of hard physical labour, marathon prayer sessions and inadequate food and sleep. The cult's liturgy was an extraordinary fusion of Ugandan Catholicism, Pentecostal evangelism, apocalyptic doom-mongering and local superstition. Cult members were working to be 'redeemed' when the great 'sift' came. They had to guard against constant temptation - not least by evil local spirits. Only the strictest adherence to Mwerinde's codes could ensure salvation. The cult members slept on thin papyrus mats packed into overcrowded dormitories. Men were segregated from women, and sex was forbidden. Everyone had to wear green and white gowns. All conversation was banned. Medication was forbidden - even when children started dying of measles - and no visitors were allowed into the main compound. Discipline was maintained with fierce beatings. The leaders lived apart with better food and lodging. Mwerinde, who was usually seen in flowing white robes with a gold cross around her neck, got fat over the 11 years she ran the cult. Life was grim. 'Monday and Friday were strictly for fasting,' Besigye Emmanuel, once a carpenter at the cult's church, says. 'The rest of the days we'd get a bowl of porridge or some maize and millet bread for lunch, but that was all. We'd get up at dawn and work in the fields until it was dark, with an hour off at noon. Then we'd pray and sing until midnight.' Mwerinde used a variety of means to separate cult members from their cash. As the police have yet to trace any bank accounts, the extent of her wealth will probably never be known. For some there was a joining fee; others were threatened with expulsion (and thus banishment from the kingdom of heaven) unless they handed over their property. The greed was undisguised. On one occasion, Mwerinde is said to have rushed into the cult's church screaming that the Virgin Mary had just spoken to her. The message: 'You must give me more money, or we will all be damned.' The cult members' credulity seems almost pathetic. In a room close to the church where so many died, a shrine was set up consisting of a dozen clay statues of the Holy Family on a desk. Every week it was covered with transparent plastic and a lantern placed on the floor underneath. Then, in the evening, the cult members filed in to gasp at the visitation from heaven bathed in celestial light. The question must be why so many people - authorities believe there were up to 4,000 members at a number of different compounds throughout western Uganda - accepted such a life. The cult leaders undoubtedly targeted the vulnerable, but still it stretches the bounds of credibility that so many people could be so deceived. I am sitting in a bar in the dirty, ragged, muddy town of Rukengiri drinking warm Nile beer with Johnson and Herbert, two local wide boys. I have just driven an hour over dirt roads from Kanungu and it is getting dark and the rain is coming in again. The stench of rotting corpses that hangs over the cult compound is still on my clothes. Johnson and Herbert are alternating beers - which they drink through straws from the bottle - with beakers full of Malibu. 'This thing is true, my friend,' says Johnson while smoothing the creases on his wide-collared blue shirt. 'Everyone here wants to go some place else. To America, to Europe, to South Africa, even to Kampala, just anywhere but here.' Uganda may not be the poorest part of Africa, and the area around Kanungu may be comparatively prosperous, but for most people here, life is harsh.

In early February, they launched a recruitment drive. A series of radio advertisements were broadcast throughout western Uganda. The national radio station was even approached about a wider campaign. Thousands of leaflets were distributed and scores of ex-members received personal visits from the cult leaders. This is it, they were told, this is your last chance for eternal peace and salvation. By early March, preparations were well underway. Kataribabo bought several dozen litres of sulphuric acid from a store in Rukengiri. Several large jerry cans full of petrol were bought. All cult members were told to sell off their property and burn whatever was left. Livestock and equipment at the Kanungu farm were sold off at knockdown prices. And the taxis full of those answering the call of the leaflets and the advertisements kept pulling up at the cult's headquarters. Late on the evening of 16 March, Kibwetere appeared at the local police post, which had neither telephone nor vehicles. He handed over the Movement's articles of registration and land titles. Up at their compound, an unprecedented celebration was underway. Cattle had been slaughtered and roasted over fires and soft drinks distributed. At midnight, up to 550 people trooped into the church. Its windows were nailed shut - to keep out the coming floods. The church was an ark that would take them to heaven. They prayed, sang and chanted through the night. Around 8am, according to witnesses, a group of cult members emerged from the church and rounded up children who had been playing in the flowerbeds outside. The doors of the building were then nailed shut from the inside. The entire congregation smeared themselves in 'Nightrose' - a highly inflammable oil - and then lit candles. At their head stood the giant farm manager. From physical evidence retrieved by investigators it appears that he ignited - possibly with a flaming torch - one of the barrels full of petrol that stood in each corner. Around 550 people, including 78 children, were incinerated within moments. The Ugandan police have stopped digging for bodies. They admit there are probably many more to be found, but say they simply don't have the resources to deal with any more corpses. The death toll already exceeds that of the Jim Jones's mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978, so what's the point in excavating more, they say. They have made one not particularly impressive arrest. The Reverend Richard Mutazendwa, a Kanungu official who is alleged to have accepted gifts of cattle and cash from the cult in return for deflecting the attention of suspicious government inspectors, is now languishing in prison. Credonia Mwerinde, Joseph Kibwetere and Father Dominic Kataribabo are still at large. There is an Interpol alert out for them, but few are hopeful that they will be brought to justice. The cults' main vehicle - a blue Toyota pick-up truck - disappeared on the night of the blaze and has only been seen once since: in a small village close to the border with Rwanda and the Congo.",

      "body": "<p>What happens to the weekend when you have kids? Where does it go? And, to borrow an old metaphysical chestnut, does a weekend still exist if you don't see it flash by with your own eyes? </p> <p>It's one of the quirks of biological necessity that nature smooths the course of human reproduction by opening our minds to the pleasures of parenthood while keeping us ignorant of the full scale of its horrors. We think changing nappies is the bad part, when they're the easy bit. We joke with pregnant fathers about the prospect of sleepless nights, though at the time of joking we still think of a sleepless night as something that can be slept off during the day, the result of some self-inflicted pleasure - a marathon drugs binge perhaps or a conspicuously protracted sex tournament with someone you're still trying to impress. </p> <p>Even when we've made up our minds to have kids and done the antenatal classes, skimmed through the manuals and thought up trendy names, we're still pretty clueless. Until it's too late. None of us expects having children to improve the quality of life exactly, but where does it say you have to give up weekends? </p> <p>Having a civilised weekend is what separates us from the dolphins. It is Saturday, therefore you get up at noon, go to the pub, buy a pint of milk, go back to bed, eat some Pot Noodles, watch Match of the Day, go back to bed again. The details may differ from person to person (some people, I understand, enjoy potholing and visiting museums and, if you are a couple, sexual intercourse and shopping for kitchen utensils might well come into it), but the point is you can do what you like. It's supposed to be the opposite of work. </p> <p>But that was then. All the surveys are telling us how frantic we are about devoting more quality time to our children - far more than our parents ever gave us, the bastards - and the weekend is when we do it. Our children can't get rid of us. We scoop them up and take them off to leisure pools or Roman ruins or museums specialising in agricultural machinery. We read to them, pretend to take an interest in their incomprehensible computer games, intrude on their private woes with our anxiety for their mental health. One day they'll hate us for it. And it's all down to guilt for not being around enough the rest of the week. </p> <p>Working women are by far the worst culprits. According to one survey, mothers in full-time employment do 56 hours of chores and childcare every week. I'm sorry, but that is sick. Even fathers do 31 hours (it says here). Of course, women are bound to do the lion's share of the housework - it's in the blood, as I think Darwin explained. But this is something else. And it all adds up to less time to relax, put your feet up and watch Football Focus. </p> <p>Even after four children, I still can't quite get used to the lost weekend. Once I'm out of bed at the shockingly late hour of 8.30, I hang around in my dressing-gown eating toast, awaiting instructions from my wife, whose job it is to run the duty roster and stop me sitting down to read yesterday's paper. One of us has to take the six-year-old for his swimming lesson, leaving the other (me) to take an active interest in the rest of them, who are watching Pok\u00e9mon and who I'm pretty sure wouldn't notice if I set myself on fire, let alone slipped back to bed for a while. </p> <p>But I can't. Statistically, one of the children will need to be taken for either a haircut or a pair of shoes. There will be endless meals and auxiliary snacks to prepare, cook and clear away. We might lose one child to a party at Quasar (if you have to ask, don't), but one of us will have to ferry him to the next town and pick him up again. A small DIY job will have risen to the top of our priorities, involving the use of a drill, which will breed subsidiary DIY jobs of polyfilling unwanted craters around the site of the first. </p> <p>Our staggered sessions of baths, TV suppers and bedtime stories will stretch from six till 9.45 and that's it. Half the weekend gone. Do you see any room in there for going trout-fishing, writing haikus or climbing Mount Snowdon? After Hoovering up the debris and mopping their footprints off the walls, we will sit down and open a bottle of red wine to celebrate still being awake. Admittedly, the proceedings will still be enlivened by Match of the Day, but the five-minute spell in which all the goals are scored will be marked by our three-year-old shouting the house down for a drink or a wee or, sometimes, just for the hell of it. </p> <p>I do feel sorry for new parents. Polly (not her real name), who my wife knows from the days when she had a social life that didn't involve taking the Tesco loyalty card out with her, has one of those cash-rich, time-poor jobs that entails flying to Tokyo and back just in time to watch the nanny putting 18-month-old Archie to bed, which then means devoting weekends to doing guilt-time with the little chap. It's driving her nutty. </p> <p>'I'm trying to make up what I can't give him properly in the week, but I'm so exhausted. We never have a lie-in,' she tells me. 'I miss going to lunch and the cinema and just relaxing. You think children are just going to fit into your life and they don't. You have to fit into theirs. You think you can just take them into restaurants with you, but you end up at Pizza Hut or somewhere else with highchairs. I can never go shopping for clothes or go into a department store. I know it sounds selfish but I just want five minutes to unwind and relax. To be honest, I'd really quite like to get my nails done.' </p> <p>Her husband who is a part-time lecturer and in his late fifties (quite a bit older than her), is very good - though at medieval history rather than childcare. 'He makes a big fuss of Archie,' she says, 'but he doesn't much like being left alone with him. He doesn't know what to do.' </p> <p>Well I'm glad it's not just me. </p> <p>I'm in the pub with Sam after a hard day at the office. 'How do you relax at weekends?' I ask. Sam has three boys and is still under 30, so obviously I'm looking for tales of woe. 'Play tennis in the mornings,' he says. 'Take the kids to the supermarket in the afternoon, chill out...' Chilling out involves watching something called Soccer Saturday on Sky! I can't believe it. 'We look after the kids in shifts,' he explains. His wife Odile, who is French and laid back, bakes cakes, but sometimes just slobs around watching ancient Sunday afternoon movies while he takes the kids swimming. They buy a huge Indian (food, not person) for Saturday night. They are very happy. </p> <p>'And you don't have to do anything else - housework, DIY?' </p> <p>What - at the weekend ? He never does DIY or housework. He tells me about a man who lives on a boat nearby and does the occasional odd job for them. A woman comes in to clean every couple of weeks. He starts telling me about long lie-ins, leisurely breakfasts. I have to stop him before he starts telling me about his fantastic sex life. </p> <p>Still, as a strategy for relaxation, shiftwork has much to recommend it and is obviously less traumatic than divorce as a means of sharing the children out at weekends. I do have a few escape routes myself, the most successful one being retiring to my so-called study to do something urgent that I had forgotten about. Less risky strategies include asking friends round, which involves cooking and cleaning, but you do get to talk to other adults and drink during daylight. Better still is to go to someone else's house and let them do the work. </p> <p>But the healthy alternative is... well, getting used to it. Natalie, one of the mums at our children's school has five kids under 12 and holds down a job as a doctor too. Is she completely mad? No, she loves her work, she says, because she gets to use her brain and is allowed to go to the toilet on her own. But she looks forward to weekends, too, even though Colin, her husband (a consultant), works Saturdays. </p> <p>'The weekend is a lot easier because the pressure's off. I don't have to get them to school; there are no after-school activities, no music practice.' Just lots more time for cuddling, she says. Of course, there's the usual frenetic round of football training, library, swimming lessons, flat tyres to repair and washing machines to load up. But she doesn't do any dusting or gardening or ironing. A woman comes in to help with the kids and housework during the week and that's it. </p> <p>'Don't you ever do anything without the children?' I ask. </p> <p>'Never,' she says. 'But the point is I don't expect any time to myself. As soon as you accept that this is your life - having loads of children, getting up in the middle of the night - you enjoy it. I don't fight it, I just go with it.' </p> <p>Maybe I could just 'go' with it too. I'll definitely give it some thought. Well, the next time I can hear myself think.</p>",

You think you can just take them into restaurants with you, but you end up at Pizza Hut or somewhere else with highchairs. I can never go shopping for clothes or go into a department store. I know it sounds selfish but I just want five minutes to unwind and relax. To be honest, I'd really quite like to get my nails done.' Her husband who is a part-time lecturer and in his late fifties (quite a bit older than her), is very good - though at medieval history rather than childcare. 'He makes a big fuss of Archie,' she says, 'but he doesn't much like being left alone with him. He doesn't know what to do.' Well I'm glad it's not just me. I'm in the pub with Sam after a hard day at the office. 'How do you relax at weekends?' I ask. Sam has three boys and is still under 30, so obviously I'm looking for tales of woe. 'Play tennis in the mornings,' he says. 'Take the kids to the supermarket in the afternoon, chill out...' Chilling out involves watching something called Soccer Saturday on Sky! I can't believe it. 'We look after the kids in shifts,' he explains. His wife Odile, who is French and laid back, bakes cakes, but sometimes just slobs around watching ancient Sunday afternoon movies while he takes the kids swimming. They buy a huge Indian (food, not person) for Saturday night. They are very happy. 'And you don't have to do anything else - housework, DIY?' What - at the weekend ? He never does DIY or housework. He tells me about a man who lives on a boat nearby and does the occasional odd job for them. A woman comes in to clean every couple of weeks. He starts telling me about long lie-ins, leisurely breakfasts. I have to stop him before he starts telling me about his fantastic sex life. Still, as a strategy for relaxation, shiftwork has much to recommend it and is obviously less traumatic than divorce as a means of sharing the children out at weekends. I do have a few escape routes myself, the most successful one being retiring to my so-called study to do something urgent that I had forgotten about. Less risky strategies include asking friends round, which involves cooking and cleaning, but you do get to talk to other adults and drink during daylight. Better still is to go to someone else's house and let them do the work. But the healthy alternative is... well, getting used to it. Natalie, one of the mums at our children's school has five kids under 12 and holds down a job as a doctor too. Is she completely mad? No, she loves her work, she says, because she gets to use her brain and is allowed to go to the toilet on her own. But she looks forward to weekends, too, even though Colin, her husband (a consultant), works Saturdays. 'The weekend is a lot easier because the pressure's off. I don't have to get them to school; there are no after-school activities, no music practice.' Just lots more time for cuddling, she says. Of course, there's the usual frenetic round of football training, library, swimming lessons, flat tyres to repair and washing machines to load up. But she doesn't do any dusting or gardening or ironing. A woman comes in to help with the kids and housework during the week and that's it. 'Don't you ever do anything without the children?' I ask. 'Never,' she says. 'But the point is I don't expect any time to myself. As soon as you accept that this is your life - having loads of children, getting up in the middle of the night - you enjoy it. I don't fight it, I just go with it.' Maybe I could just 'go' with it too. I'll definitely give it some thought. Well, the next time I can hear myself think.",

      "body": "<p>The dark sunglasses, nondescript grey clothes and floppy hat pulled down over his eyes are a poor disguise. Almost everyone in the north London Italian restaurant where we meet for lunch recognises David Ginola. Heads turn as soon as he opens the door; there's an outbreak of stares, nudges and whispers. He shrugs off the attention gracefully. He's used to it. </p> <p>Since moving here five years ago, Ginola has worked almost as hard at building a profile for himself outside football as he has on the pitch. There was the catwalk outing for Cerruti and those ads for L'Or\u00e9al shampoo ('Because I'm worth it') and Renault Laguna cars ('It's all worked out beautifully for Ginola'); the World Cup commentating stint for the BBC; the chat- show appearances and magazine covers; the 11-page spread in Hello!. He has also addressed the Oxford Union, passionate and ironic in equal measure, on the mortal danger facing English soccer from the huge number of imported footballers. </p> <p>Today, though, the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder is in less flamboyant mode. As Princess Diana's successor as the public face of the Red Cross's worldwide campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines, Ginola is preparing for a very public and potentially risky trip to Cambodia.</p> <p>In two weeks, the day after facing Sunderland on the last day of the Premiership season, instead of indulging in the usual footballer's summer holiday - sun, all-day drinking, nightclubs and run-ins with tabloid snoops in Gran Canaria - he will fly to one of the most heavily-mined countries in Asia. As Cambodia's fragile peace allows citizens to return home after decades of war to areas previously inaccessible because of the fighting, more minefields are being stumbled upon. Old mines create new victims every day. </p> <p>The killing fields await Ginola, as does an exacting tour of duty, taking in sites such as a component factory in Phnom Penh which makes artificial limbs for amputees and a limb-fitting centre in Battambang, where these prostheses help victims regain mobility and self-respect. He'll also play in a football match with some landmine survivors and witness a de-mining operation in one of the many rural areas infested with mines. A retinue of journalists and cameramen will record his every move. </p> <p>It's an unusual way to spend a summer break, even for a footballer who conforms to none of the usual stereotypes. Why is he doing it? 'Landmines is a big cause, and the Red Cross a big charity,' he answers. 'The Princess of Wales did so many remarkable things on landmines that when she died it would have been a shame for the Red Cross to leave the campaign like that and forget about it. It would not have been right to just remember the Princess of Wales but forget that she was working on the landmines issue.' </p> <p>Ginola has already visited Angola and was deeply affected by what he saw. He played a game with some young amputees. 'It was remarkable. They were playing great football, and they train every day using both the prostheses and the other leg to kick the ball. One of our team scored two goals, one with the normal leg and one with the prosthesis. Sometimes, they forget they have lost a leg. They put on a brand new pair of trainers provided by the Red Cross and they are quite happy. We try and make them think, \"OK, this isn't the best thing, but although I've blown on a mine, life isn't finished yet\".' </p> <p>One girl failed to be inspired by this can-do approach, however. 'She was seven or eight. I could see in her eyes that she was thinking, \"You, white guy, what are you doing here and can you explain why this has happened to me?\" The girl had trodden on a landmine when she and her mother were walking down a path they used every day to collect water from a pond. Her mother wasn't injured, but she saw what happened.' Lost for words, he simply held her hand. </p> <p>Ginola argues that in our celebrity-obsessed culture, names and faces have a duty to use their fame to help others. 'If you are organising an event and you need to attract interest, or cheques, you need names. Without famous people, you have nothing.' It's a responsibility he claims both to love and hate. 'Sometimes, I'd like to go somewhere and be completely anonymous, like eating somewhere and not having people looking at you. Like today, you realise people recognise you. You can't do anything silly. Everything I do, I have to be careful of my image as a father, football player, husband and person with the badge of the Red Cross. It's like to be a priest. I have almost to be a saint everywhere I go.' </p> <p>On the pitch, Ginola is a wonderfully gifted, crowd-pleasing extrovert. Two days before we met, he had shown off the full range of his repertoire in Tottenham's 4-2 home defeat by Aston Villa. His first touch, a cheeky backheel, drew appreciative cheers. He regularly beat two or three opponents, forced the opposition to substitute his marker at half-time and was at the heart of Tottenham's best moves. Any time he got the ball, the level of noise - and of anticipation - rose.</p> <p>But the instinctive entertainer is also a team player, always looking to create opportunities for usually much less talented colleagues. He was voted player of the year last year by football writers and fellow professionals alike. However, he is now 33 and has at most five years left. So how fulfilled is he as a footballer? A pause. 'Frustrated,' comes the reply. It is a refreshingly candid answer.</p> <p>It quickly becomes clear that Ginola is consumed with regret and a sense of missed opportunities which cuts deep. 'I've played for 15 years as a professional. When I think about my quality, my skills, what I'm capable of doing on the pitch, I deserve to be playing in a really top team. I will not say Newcastle United [his former club] and Tottenham are not big clubs,' he says, correcting himself quickly, not wanting to appear ungrateful, 'but by big clubs I mean Milan, Barcelona and Manchester United.' That, he says, is his natural level. </p> <p>While on Tyneside, Ginola had two chances to transfer to Barcelona. The first time, Newcastle would not release him; the second, Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff, his boyhood hero, could not get rid of two established stars whose departure would have enabled the Frenchman to come. 'This kind of thing really frustrates me, because I think I would be even bigger today if I had played there for the last four or five years. I would have played in the Champions League every year.' </p> <p>Instead, he has suffered disappointment as a Kevin Keegan-managed Newcastle team blew a 12-point lead to hand Manchester United the title and has spent the last two seasons as the star turn in a very ordinary Tottenham team. The success he experienced for three years with Paris Saint Germain has not dulled his view that, as his friends put it, he has been 'wasting my talent' in England since 1995.</p> <p>Even worse was the experience of being voted France's player of the year in 1994 and then almost immediately being discarded by French national team boss Gerard Houllier, now manager at Liverpool. Houllier blamed Ginola for ensuring that France didn't qualify for the 1994 World Cup. A misplaced pass from the winger's boot in the final qualifying game ended up with a Bulgarian opponent and, seconds later, led to a goal which put France out. Houllier branded him 'a criminal' and he was dumped from the national side. The memory still hurts. </p> <p>'It's a team effort. When you win, it's a team effort; when you lose, it's a team effort. People said I had killed their dream. But this isn't fair. Everybody was hiding behind me.' </p> <p>When France hosted the same tournament four years later, Les Bleus also won it by beating the mighty Brazil in the final. Ginola was in Paris as part of the BBC's commentary team. How did he feel about his compatriots' victory? 'Very bad. It was fantastic for the French people, but on the other hand, from a personal point of view, it was terrible.' Because you should have been out on the pitch with them? He nods. An occasion of national rejoicing became a moment of intense private grief, another case of what should have been. </p> <p>Ginola is already contemplating life after football. Several film scripts have arrived and he's thinking about maybe trying to break into acting, as Eric Cantona, his fellow countryman, has been trying to do. 'When you did a job like football all your life, and it was carrying so much emotion [note the past tense], to find something else that's giving you the same kind of emotions is very difficult. I will not be able to work easily in an office because I have spent most of my life outside, on the pitch.' </p> <p>Whatever happens, he thinks he will stay in England, though he will move from his house in Totteridge, on the suburban fringe of north London, to the countryside. He's had enough of being bothered by fans who know where he lives and has a longing for rural life. </p> <p>Does coaching or management appeal? He doesn't rule it out but reckons the relentless pressure of being a football boss would be too much. In his next life, he wants to be able to spend more, not less, time with his wife Coraline, his son Andrea and daughter Carla. 'That is most important. I don't want to see my boy any longer crying at the airport leaving for France saying, \"I want to stay with you, Daddy\" while I'm staying here to play matches.' </p> <p>Talk of his son brings him back to football and to what might have been. 'I look at my boy on a Saturday morning when he's going training, I think about when I was his age, dreaming about being a professional and dreaming about winning trophies. I still dream in the night about winning trophies. Well, life goes by very, very quickly.' </p> <p>\u0095 For more information, contact the <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org\">British Red Cross</a>, 9 Grosvenor Crescent, London SW1X 7EJ (tel: 020-7201 5060)</p>",

On show will also be a special commission the 89-year-old has created for the museum's 155m-long Turbine Hall. Entitled I Do, I Undo and I Redo , the installation consists of three steel towers, which incorporate spiral staircases, large circular mirrors, platforms and bell jars containing sculpted figures of a mother and child.</p> <p>At the artist's four-storey house in New York's Chelsea a few weeks ago, an intense, talented, Slav-sounding performance artist called Denise gave her interpretation of a text written by Bourgeois, also called I Do, I Undo, I Redo . Far more surreal than the Tate installation, it involved Denise waving a piece of material furiously in the air, writhing around on the floor screaming 'Fernand L\u00e9ger, L\u00e9ger, L\u00e9ger', and smashing one of Bourgeois's sculptures to smithereens on the coffee table. When it was over, Bourgeois grinned from behind her desk. 'I hope you're going to break lots more of my sculptures in the future!'</p> <p>Bourgeois herself has been known to destroy her works of art in front of television cameras in the past. Her other antics are legendary. She regularly throws fits and walks away from interviewers. When photographer Nan Goldin took her portrait, Bourgeois took her scissors to the negatives and cut up all but the one she wanted Goldin to use. Another camera meister , Duane Michals, photographed her three times in the Sixties. He still remembers her as one of the most difficult subjects he has ever had to deal with. Indeed, while those who know her well insist that she is adorable, for others she is quite simply unbearable. 'I break everything I touch because I am violent,' she once said. 'I destroy the relationships I have with my friends, lovers, children.'</p> <p>She moved to the house in Chelsea in 1962 with her family. Her late husband, the American art historian Robert Goldwater, hired an architect to redo the interiors. Today, it looks like the place hasn't been touched since. The paint is peeling off the walls, the parquet floors are in need of a good sanding, and the furniture is decidedly old and tatty. In the living room is a worn, round coffee table and a rather hip-looking red highchair. In one corner is Bourgeois's desk - a former dining table, which she cut in half after her husband died. Today, she still eats on it after cleaning it thoroughly with bleach. Next to it, a set square hangs on the wall and a metronome sits on a bench. One wall is covered with photocopies of awards, exhibition invitations and a couple of abstract watercolours. The other is completely taken up by bookshelves, laden with everything from a bread bin and videotapes, to files and a book about the Paine Webber art collection.</p> <p>When I arrive, Bourgeois is hiding away in her tiny kitchen. With two ancient (and apparently dangerous) gas rings and a row of old tin cups hanging on hooks from the cupboards, it looks very much like something from a bygone era. It takes a good while for her to come out and greet her guests. They are a motley crew. As well as Denise, there is a rather sinister-looking Italian dressed in a three-piece navy-blue velvet suit.</p> <p>There's also a guy called Jason from an artists' community called Yaddo in Saratoga Springs (touch the box of work he has brought along to show Bourgeois and he himself springs on you sharply). There's also a sculptress friend of Bourgeois's called Cheyne and a woman called Phyllis, who keeps managing to stand in front of the camera (the weekly Sunday gatherings are always filmed).</p> <p>The one person, however, who seems to concern Bourgeois is a German artist called Konrad Klapheck, who is coming to do her portrait. When he calls to say that he's lost, Bourgeois says very audibly to her assistant that, 'He's the only person I really want to see this afternoon'. Very nice for the rest of us. It is only one example of Bourgeois's quite astounding impoliteness. At one stage, when the Italian starts to speak, she cuts him dead by saying, 'Who asked you to talk? It's not your turn.' When Cheyne unveils one of her latest sculptures, Bourgeois asks her pointedly, 'What's the horrible thing there in the corner?' She also brings out a cheesecake with a pile of dessert plates. However, instead of offering everyone a piece, she proceeds to scoff the whole of it herself.</p> <p>But with the arrival of Klapheck, he becomes the number one victim of her wrath. After he has endeared himself by telling everyone without the slightest hint of irony that 'I'm a famous artist. Oh yes, I am', he sets about sketching Bourgeois's portrait. She then starts making demands. 'I want a big smile,' she orders, yet fixes her face in a grimace. After his first, very swift preparatory drawing, she throws a fit, starts prodding at it with a knife, insists that he modifies it considerably and refuses to let him do another. Quite understandably, he ends up walking out, complaining that he can't work in such conditions. But Bourgeois has somehow managed to coax him into coming back the following week. But not before he has asked her, 'How would you feel if someone started telling you what to do with your work?'</p> <p>The answer is that Bourgeois would be furious. Indeed, throughout her career, she has always kept an independent path and avoided being influenced by any of the century's major artistic trends. Her earliest sculptures were spindly, totem-like, wooden forms she built on the roof of her apartment in the 40s. In the 60s, she started working with poured forms, such as plaster and latex. Wide recognition, however, did not come until the 70s, and since then she has provoked us with her sexually ambiguous figures, 'cells' (evocative installations incorporating doors, windows and objects like decapitated limbs, mirrors and toys) and more recently, her gigantic spiders.</p> <p>Each of her spiders, she says, represents her mother ('my best friend. She was a weaver like the spider'), and her family and childhood are constant themes in her work. 'My childhood never lost its magic, never lost its mystery, and never lost its drama,' she says. She was born in Paris on Christmas Day, 1911. In Bourgeois's eyes, her mother was a saint. Her father most certainly was not. He ran a tapestry repair company, had a collection of garden sculptures (his wife would not let him have any in the house) and introduced his mistress, Sadie, into the household as the family governess. In 1974, Bourgeois produced a piece entitled The Destruction of the Father . 'Since I was demolished by my father, why shouldn't I demolish him?' she asks.</p> <p>The basement of her house serves as a studio. Medieval-like iron gates stand at the top of the wooden stairs leading down to it. The objects found there are certainly eclectic. There is a large, Gothic-style fireplace, a drill machine and an archaic printing press. On the wall is written enigmatically: 'The whining pit - Camus'. A black mannequin lies on a cardboard box, old drawings are propped up on the water pipes (one, entitled A Cottage Seamstress , recalls her mother's profession) and Bourgeois's own works are scattered about. There are two columns made from ribbon bobbins in one corner, sculptures of family groups on a bench and unorganised piles of drawings.</p> <p>An insomniac, Bourgeois now spends most of her nights drawing. On her bedside table is a loopy composition. A telephone number is scrawled on the bedroom wall, industrial lamps are attached to bookshelves and a drawing of Adam and Eve sits on the marble fireplace. There are books everywhere in the house (she used to run a bookstore in the 50s). In the room in which she now sleeps are numerous French classics - Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris , Jules Verne's Voyages Extraordinaires and La Fontaine's Fables .</p> <p>On the same floor is the bedroom she used to share with her husband. A photo of Goldwater, with their son Jean-Louis, stands on the fireplace, a framed Bourgeois painting of a totem-like figure hangs between the windows, and a pile of old fabrics rest on a chair. The bedspread is a red and white crocheted affair. The walls are unpainted and completely cracked. In actual fact, the room remains exactly as it was when Goldwater was alive and has not been touched since. Stuck in her past, it seems there are some things Bourgeois simply does not want to undo and redo.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 12 May, the new Tate Modern will open with a temporary exhibition devoted to the French-born, New York-based sculptor Louise Bourgeois. On show will also be a special commission the 89-year-old has created for the museum's 155m-long Turbine Hall. Entitled I Do, I Undo and I Redo , the installation consists of three steel towers, which incorporate spiral staircases, large circular mirrors, platforms and bell jars containing sculpted figures of a mother and child. At the artist's four-storey house in New York's Chelsea a few weeks ago, an intense, talented, Slav-sounding performance artist called Denise gave her interpretation of a text written by Bourgeois, also called I Do, I Undo, I Redo . Far more surreal than the Tate installation, it involved Denise waving a piece of material furiously in the air, writhing around on the floor screaming 'Fernand L\u00e9ger, L\u00e9ger, L\u00e9ger', and smashing one of Bourgeois's sculptures to smithereens on the coffee table. When it was over, Bourgeois grinned from behind her desk. 'I hope you're going to break lots more of my sculptures in the future!' Bourgeois herself has been known to destroy her works of art in front of television cameras in the past. Her other antics are legendary. She regularly throws fits and walks away from interviewers. When photographer Nan Goldin took her portrait, Bourgeois took her scissors to the negatives and cut up all but the one she wanted Goldin to use. Another camera meister , Duane Michals, photographed her three times in the Sixties. He still remembers her as one of the most difficult subjects he has ever had to deal with. Indeed, while those who know her well insist that she is adorable, for others she is quite simply unbearable. 'I break everything I touch because I am violent,' she once said. 'I destroy the relationships I have with my friends, lovers, children.' She moved to the house in Chelsea in 1962 with her family. Her late husband, the American art historian Robert Goldwater, hired an architect to redo the interiors. Today, it looks like the place hasn't been touched since. The paint is peeling off the walls, the parquet floors are in need of a good sanding, and the furniture is decidedly old and tatty. In the living room is a worn, round coffee table and a rather hip-looking red highchair. In one corner is Bourgeois's desk - a former dining table, which she cut in half after her husband died. Today, she still eats on it after cleaning it thoroughly with bleach. Next to it, a set square hangs on the wall and a metronome sits on a bench. One wall is covered with photocopies of awards, exhibition invitations and a couple of abstract watercolours. The other is completely taken up by bookshelves, laden with everything from a bread bin and videotapes, to files and a book about the Paine Webber art collection. When I arrive, Bourgeois is hiding away in her tiny kitchen. With two ancient (and apparently dangerous) gas rings and a row of old tin cups hanging on hooks from the cupboards, it looks very much like something from a bygone era. It takes a good while for her to come out and greet her guests. They are a motley crew. As well as Denise, there is a rather sinister-looking Italian dressed in a three-piece navy-blue velvet suit. There's also a guy called Jason from an artists' community called Yaddo in Saratoga Springs (touch the box of work he has brought along to show Bourgeois and he himself springs on you sharply). There's also a sculptress friend of Bourgeois's called Cheyne and a woman called Phyllis, who keeps managing to stand in front of the camera (the weekly Sunday gatherings are always filmed). The one person, however, who seems to concern Bourgeois is a German artist called Konrad Klapheck, who is coming to do her portrait. When he calls to say that he's lost, Bourgeois says very audibly to her assistant that, 'He's the only person I really want to see this afternoon'. Very nice for the rest of us. It is only one example of Bourgeois's quite astounding impoliteness. At one stage, when the Italian starts to speak, she cuts him dead by saying, 'Who asked you to talk? It's not your turn.' When Cheyne unveils one of her latest sculptures, Bourgeois asks her pointedly, 'What's the horrible thing there in the corner?' She also brings out a cheesecake with a pile of dessert plates. However, instead of offering everyone a piece, she proceeds to scoff the whole of it herself. But with the arrival of Klapheck, he becomes the number one victim of her wrath. After he has endeared himself by telling everyone without the slightest hint of irony that 'I'm a famous artist. Oh yes, I am', he sets about sketching Bourgeois's portrait. She then starts making demands. 'I want a big smile,' she orders, yet fixes her face in a grimace. After his first, very swift preparatory drawing, she throws a fit, starts prodding at it with a knife, insists that he modifies it considerably and refuses to let him do another. Quite understandably, he ends up walking out, complaining that he can't work in such conditions. But Bourgeois has somehow managed to coax him into coming back the following week. But not before he has asked her, 'How would you feel if someone started telling you what to do with your work?' The answer is that Bourgeois would be furious.

      "body": "<p>Ruth Rogers is standing at her usual station at one end of the stainless-steel bar that runs the length of The River Cafe. Under a small pool of halogen light she is casting her ice-blue eyes over each plate before a waitress dispatches it to a table. She breaks up asparagus, looks for a missing herb - occasionally she sends a plate back, but more often she simply wipes its rim, pausing every so often to push her straight blonde hair back off her face. In the corner, there is a party of her friends, which includes Salman Rushdie (and his bodyguards at a separate table), and she is paying particular attention to the progress of their order ('Where's that pigeon?' she calls to her chef from time to time). </p> <p>Towards nine o'clock, when the restaurant is candlelit and full, one of her waitresses, a trainee architect, approaches to mention that 'table 16 say they are friends of yours'. Rogers scans the room, looks blank. 'I've never seen them before in my life,' she tells me, from the corner of her mouth. And then, catching the eye of the woman in question, offers a wave and a beam of a smile. The River Cafe used to employ a system whereby 'friends of Ruthie' would be denoted in the reservation book: F.O.R. Eventually this was amended to incorporate F.O.F.O.Rs (friends of friends of Ruthie), but when that seemed to account for just about everybody, the system was abandoned. 'Very occasionally,' she says conspiratorially, 'I've gone up to people and confronted them and said, \"Do I know you?\"' Usually, she admits, it turns out that she does. </p> <p>Ever since Ruth Rogers joined forces with her partner Rose Gray 13 years ago to open The River Cafe as a canteen for her husband Richard Rogers's architecture practice next door, it has been much more than a restaurant. Their plan, they say, was to create 'a kind of utopia on the banks of the Thames'. Just as Lord Rogers, New Labour's favourite architect, has a vision to recreate urban communities based on Italianate ideas of shared public spaces, so his wife and her partner, New Labour's favourite cooks, wanted to make something that was more a way of life than a place to eat. </p> <p>'Food was just one part of the concept,' says Rose Gray, who could pass for Ruth's slightly older, more intellectual sister. 'Both Ruth and I had large families, a lot of mouths to feed, and we had both spent a lot of time in Italy. We were struck by the way Italians approached family life: they cook very good, simple food which everyone, including the young children, eats. And they have a communal way of making a meal - having someone shell peas, having someone else peel artichokes makes the whole thing more fun. We used to do it with our children and now we do it with our staff. We wanted the restaurant to be like a big family.' </p> <p>The family gets bigger all the time. Not only does it embrace the writers and film stars (Hugh and Liz, Ralph and Francesca, Uma and Madonna) who dine here, it also extends to the newly formed polenta-eating classes. The River Cafe's first cookbook, River Cafe Cookbook , with its totemic typography, has sold half a million copies; Rogers and Gray have made a couple of TV series - 'two thin ladies' as one critic dubbed them - and now they are on to their third volume of recipes: River Cafe Green , which is organised around seasonal, and mainly organic vegetables (many of which your greengrocer won't be able to pronounce let alone produce, 'but keep at him,' says Rose). </p> <p>The food remains wonderful, if expensive. If Lord Rogers's Urban Task Force marched on its stomach, you guess, inner cities might be transformed overnight. And the restaurant's political influence may not only be symbolic. The River Cafe has long been a kind of unofficial canteen for New Labour. The Blairs and Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown have been regular mozzarella munchers over the years. On the night of Labour's election victory, Ruth sent a food parcel round to the new prime minister; when Vanity Fair ran a 'London Swings Again' issue, the launch party was held at the restaurant (where else?). This chanterelle socialism has, of course, provoked some disquiet in obvious quarters. At the Tory party conference the year after their election defeat, Peter Lilley took the platform and whined about the fact that the nation was 'now all about Britpop and The River Cafe'. </p> <p>If the nation was all like The River Cafe then, you can't help thinking, we wouldn't have a great deal to worry about. It is a well-lighted space full of the aromas of ground coffee and fresh mint. Unlike most Michelin-starred restaurants, this one is run on 'democratic' principles, and there are, by their own account, no dictatorial pan-throwing tantrums from its proprietors. The restaurant drew its inspiration from New World rather than French models (there is always a sprinkling of Antipodeans on sabbatical in the kitchen). 'We never saw the point of shouting at people,' Ruth says. 'I think we both started this thing at a certain point in our lives. If people start a restaurant or any business in their twenties, there's much more ego; but I think we had already been there in a way. We're more, I don't know, grown up.' The waiters help with the food preparation, the staff eat the same food as the customers, and (prices apart, of course) the place seems open and egalitarian in spirit. Still, on the basis that most utopias fade on closer inspection, I asked Rose and Ruth if I might work for a day in their kitchen. </p> <p> When I arrive, togged up in my chef's whites, Rose is working up a lunch menu. 'Do we write \"live\" langoustines,' she asks? 'I can't remember.' </p> <p>'Well, they're not live once they've been on the grill,' someone says helpfully. </p> <p>Like any good New Labour chef, Gray takes care with presentation. 'Certain words,' she says, 'are guaranteed to shift things. \"Wood-roasted\" is always good. If we say \"Romana\" we're sure to sell a few more.' </p> <p>She and Ruth take it in turns to run the kitchen and today Rose is on lunch and Ruth on dinner. They have recently returned from completing their book and talk with a sense of relief to be back cooking after three months locked in a room with each other 'from half eight in the morning until whisky time at about seven in the evening'. </p> <p>Their partnership, they both say, is like a marriage. 'It's a very intense relationship. I suppose there is a kind of unspoken language between us,' Rose explains. That language is partly one of evangelical connoisseurship. Talk to either of them for any length of time and you are assailed with stories of this wonderful artichoke or that incredible risotto. Mention a turbot dish and Rose will tell you about the relationship they have with a number of south-coast fishing boats and how they go to different boats on different days depending on what they hear is good. (All their fish are line caught; fish get bruised in nets.) Ask what's in a pork recipe and she'll talk about a farmer in Suffolk who puts his Middlewhite sow with different pigs in a constant effort to improve the flavour of The River Cafe pork loin. </p> <p>Rose has, she explains, just returned from a few days at a wine-tasting event in Verona, at one stage trying 86 wines in a day - 'You know, blue teeth and purple mouth.' She shows me a notebook in which she notes her reactions to everything placed in front of her in a careful Elizabeth David-like hand that only gets slightly more gregarious as the day progresses. She and Ruth are jackdaws of Italian cuisine. They visit Italy every six weeks or so, persuading olive oil suppliers to show them what they do with peas, foraging in nettle beds for long-lost salad ingredients. </p> <p>As if to prove the point, Rose then sets me off preparing some puntarelle, a relation of the dandelion, with which she is going to make a salad 'in the traditional Roman style'. She is messianic about good natural ingredients. She talks of the restaurant's new vegetable garden. 'We're the only place that's got one,' she says. In her spare time, she designs gardens in her head; it all goes back, she says, to her growing up in Surrey during the war, 'with this fabulous vegetable garden. There was all sorts of rationing, but I saw how you could make good things from simple seasonal ingredients.' </p> <p>In the kitchen, meanwhile, the talk is of top-secret plans for Jamie Oliver's forthcoming stag night - Oliver was a former puntarelle peeler, as was Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall of TV dinners fame (if you want to be a star these days, shell peas) - and, at my prompting, of the differences between Rose and Ruth's ways of running the kitchen. 'Rose is more cerebral,' someone says, 'she can visualise tastes in her head. She'll come back with a sack of beans or a bag of a particular flour and have a very clear idea of what she wants you to do with it. She also does things last minute. Ruth tends to strip things to their essentials more, aims to keep things simpler, but wants to plan.' Or, says someone else: 'Rose is a bit more suspicious; Ruth's better at PR'. Or: 'Rose is far more confident than Ruth; Ruth is sometimes less sure of her decisions.' </p> <p>The kitchen is agreed on two things. First that 'It's mental when they are working together; they did a night a while back where one was on the grill and one was up front: madness.' And, second, all suitably on message, that they could not have landed in a more enlightened kitchen. There is talk of food parcels being delivered to them when they are ill; annual trips to Italy to taste olive oil. 'Where else would you get that?' </p> <p>Of her own style of running the kitchen, Rose says that she's 'capable of barking at people if its not running properly. Sometimes you have a chef who goes silent on you and you have to try to keep them all communicating, pull them out of themselves.' </p> <p>There is not a great deal of need for barking this lunchtime, however. Business is slow - only 45 covers (they can do 130 in the summer, when the garden is open) - a fact which Rose blames on the blip in the American stock market. 'Everyone has stayed by their screens,' she says. But, despite the global economic downturn, my expertly prepared puntarelle sells like hot sambucca. </p> <p>When Ruth arrives in the afternoon, double kissing me, a cardigan around her shoulders, the atmosphere changes a little. She sits down with her young assistant chef, Arthur, and constructs an evening menu partly based on what has gone well at lunchtime. There is much talk of dark plates, and of light plates. Borlotti beans travel up and down the menu, alternatively inserted and erased by Rogers, sucking her pencil. </p> <p>Arthur's role is mainly to enthuse, but occasionally he disagrees with a dish, offering suggestions of his own. ('The great thing here is that everyone has a say,' he tells me. 'If you said that kind of thing to Gordon Ramsay he'd just tell you to fuck off.') </p> <p> Ruth Rogers gives off a kind of palpable and charming nervous energy. She sets me off chopping asparagus, and tells me how she's just been on the phone to my editor, to talk about a skiing trip she's taking the next day with Richard and his five sons (Ab, Ben and Zad from his first marriage; Roo and Bo with Ruth.) She shows me how to make a perfect pear tart, all the while chivvying her staff. She reveals to me the precise moment for dispatching the caramel part of her signature caramel ice cream. ('If someone hasn't shouted \"something's burning\", then its not done'.) She laughs off my suggestions that she is running the country from her flame grill, but then admits that the previous night she had dinner with Alan Yentob, creative director of BBC1 and Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian . She introduces me to her kitchen staff and puts her hand over their mouths when they jokingly threaten to reveal indiscretions ('And me a patron of Index on Censorship'). </p> <p>Her friends tend to fall over themselves with superlatives to describe Ruth. Certainly, she seems to have led the most charmed of lives. She grew up in 'Woodstock of all places' in the 60s, the child of wealthy anti-Vietnam radicals. She met and fell for Richard in 1969, when she was in England and 19. At the time, Rogers, 15 years her senior, was married (to the architect Su Brumwell) and was earning \u00a32,000 a year teaching at the Architectural Association. Not long after Ruth moved in, however, he had his amazing break: winning the competition to design the Pompidou Centre in Paris. Ruth resigned from her job in the design department at Penguin Books and went to join him in Paris. They lived in the Place des Vosges, had their first child in 1975, and never looked back. </p> <p>'Ruthie wore very bright colours when we first met,' her husband recalls. 'Students used to ask me what came first: my wife's clothes or the colours of my buildings. The truth is that she did have a big influence on that.' If she brought colour to Rogers's life she also set about bringing it to the friends she met with her husband. She hosted parties including famous Thanksgiving dinners for fellow ex-pats like Doris Saatchi and Ed Victor. She organised political campaigns, notably 'the friends of Salman Rushdie' with her great ally the socialite publisher Caroline Michel, enlisting the support of the Yentobs and the Bertoluccis, Jacob Rothschild and Melvyn Bragg, among others. </p> <p>And she started the restaurant. Her inspiration came form her husband's mother, Dada, who died last year. Rose had known Richard long before he met Ruth and was already a disciple of his mother's cooking. Ruth was bought up to think that Italian cooking was meatballs and she was overwhelmed by what Richard's family ate. </p> <p>'Dada came from a very very wealthy family in Trieste,' she says. 'She grew up in that period when James Joyce was there, and Italo Svevo, and she married Richard's father who was a Florentine. With the onset of war, they came to London. And there she was, this Italian girl lifted out of Florence and plonked down in a bedsit behind Paddington station. She spent her whole time trying to find things here that she could cook.' </p> <p>In the early days of The River Cafe, Dada would come in and taste what Ruth and Rose were making. She always used to say: 'Too many herbs; too much butter keep it simple, simple.' And just before she died, she called Ruth to her bedside. 'Pretty much her last words to me were: go easy on the herbs, not so many herbs,' smiles Ruth. </p> <p>You can see a bit of Dada in Ruth as she cooks, trying to keep things simple. However often she does it, she says, she still gets a little adrenaline as eight o'clock comes around. 'It's like I imagine the theatre to be,' she says. But by the time the sun is setting over the Harrod's Depository opposite, she seems in her element. 'People think it must be so stressful because they get stressed out by cooking dinner for 10 people. But the most exhausting thing for us is seeing accountants or looking after the staff properly. Cooking is the fun part, the relaxing part.' </p> <p>Her lowest point, she says, was discovering that she had cooked a risotto for General Pinochet some years ago. She had, she remembers, thought the Spanish speaking party was 'just another royal family with their bodyguards'. When she found out 'my blood went cold and I was in tears... I'd poured my heart into this dictator's risotto.' </p> <p>Other than dictators, the only guests she dreads are Italian chefs. A while ago, the writer Adam Gopnik opined in The New Yorker that 'the best Italian food to be had in Europe was on the banks of the Thames'. All the Italian restaurateurs in London came and sat at the bar here and told us that what we were cooking was not Italian: 'You know, where is the Bolognese?' </p> <p>The closest she comes to a crisis this evening though, is a shortage of chard. Some nights, she says, 'it's just like a big dinner party - but then that's the idea really.' </p> <p> Working with Rogers and Gray you could convince yourself that you get a tiny glimpse of a more perfect world. It's only a restaurant, of course, but it's one in which all families are happy and all vegetables are fresh and all conversation is interesting. They get many people asking them why they don't open another restaurant, and they say there are two reasons: 'The first is that it would be impossible to find anywhere as beautiful as this; and the other is that you suddenly dilute your identity. It's nice having a piece of work that is wholly your own.' </p> <p>Like all successful recipes, this one depends on its main ingredients. In a rare moment, when they sit down together, I ask them to choose a single adjective to describe each other. 'Beautiful,' says Rose of Ruth. 'That was going to be mine,' says Ruth. She thinks for a while. 'Excellent,' she says. </p> <p>Like married couples, they say they have grown alike: 'Well, we both wear the same clothes,' says Rose, 'so to that extent, yes.' </p> <p>'Sometimes, says Ruth, 'I hear myself talking and I think, \"Oh God, I sound like Rose.\"' </p> <p>'You mean you sound excellent,' says Rose. 'Yes, of course,' says her friend, 'I sound excellent.' And they both giggle like schoolgirls. </p> <p> Observer readers can order a copy of River Cafe Green for the special price of \u00a325 (rrp \u00a330), including UK p&amp;p, by calling freephone 0800 3168 171</p>",

She breaks up asparagus, looks for a missing herb - occasionally she sends a plate back, but more often she simply wipes its rim, pausing every so often to push her straight blonde hair back off her face. In the corner, there is a party of her friends, which includes Salman Rushdie (and his bodyguards at a separate table), and she is paying particular attention to the progress of their order ('Where's that pigeon?' she calls to her chef from time to time). Towards nine o'clock, when the restaurant is candlelit and full, one of her waitresses, a trainee architect, approaches to mention that 'table 16 say they are friends of yours'. Rogers scans the room, looks blank. 'I've never seen them before in my life,' she tells me, from the corner of her mouth. And then, catching the eye of the woman in question, offers a wave and a beam of a smile. The River Cafe used to employ a system whereby 'friends of Ruthie' would be denoted in the reservation book: F.O.R. Eventually this was amended to incorporate F.O.F.O.Rs (friends of friends of Ruthie), but when that seemed to account for just about everybody, the system was abandoned. 'Very occasionally,' she says conspiratorially, 'I've gone up to people and confronted them and said, \"Do I know you?\"' Usually, she admits, it turns out that she does. Ever since Ruth Rogers joined forces with her partner Rose Gray 13 years ago to open The River Cafe as a canteen for her husband Richard Rogers's architecture practice next door, it has been much more than a restaurant. Their plan, they say, was to create 'a kind of utopia on the banks of the Thames'. Just as Lord Rogers, New Labour's favourite architect, has a vision to recreate urban communities based on Italianate ideas of shared public spaces, so his wife and her partner, New Labour's favourite cooks, wanted to make something that was more a way of life than a place to eat. 'Food was just one part of the concept,' says Rose Gray, who could pass for Ruth's slightly older, more intellectual sister. 'Both Ruth and I had large families, a lot of mouths to feed, and we had both spent a lot of time in Italy. We were struck by the way Italians approached family life: they cook very good, simple food which everyone, including the young children, eats. And they have a communal way of making a meal - having someone shell peas, having someone else peel artichokes makes the whole thing more fun. We used to do it with our children and now we do it with our staff. We wanted the restaurant to be like a big family.' The family gets bigger all the time. Not only does it embrace the writers and film stars (Hugh and Liz, Ralph and Francesca, Uma and Madonna) who dine here, it also extends to the newly formed polenta-eating classes. The River Cafe's first cookbook, River Cafe Cookbook , with its totemic typography, has sold half a million copies; Rogers and Gray have made a couple of TV series - 'two thin ladies' as one critic dubbed them - and now they are on to their third volume of recipes: River Cafe Green , which is organised around seasonal, and mainly organic vegetables (many of which your greengrocer won't be able to pronounce let alone produce, 'but keep at him,' says Rose). The food remains wonderful, if expensive. If Lord Rogers's Urban Task Force marched on its stomach, you guess, inner cities might be transformed overnight. And the restaurant's political influence may not only be symbolic. The River Cafe has long been a kind of unofficial canteen for New Labour. The Blairs and Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown have been regular mozzarella munchers over the years. On the night of Labour's election victory, Ruth sent a food parcel round to the new prime minister; when Vanity Fair ran a 'London Swings Again' issue, the launch party was held at the restaurant (where else?). This chanterelle socialism has, of course, provoked some disquiet in obvious quarters. At the Tory party conference the year after their election defeat, Peter Lilley took the platform and whined about the fact that the nation was 'now all about Britpop and The River Cafe'. If the nation was all like The River Cafe then, you can't help thinking, we wouldn't have a great deal to worry about. It is a well-lighted space full of the aromas of ground coffee and fresh mint. Unlike most Michelin-starred restaurants, this one is run on 'democratic' principles, and there are, by their own account, no dictatorial pan-throwing tantrums from its proprietors. The restaurant drew its inspiration from New World rather than French models (there is always a sprinkling of Antipodeans on sabbatical in the kitchen). 'We never saw the point of shouting at people,' Ruth says. 'I think we both started this thing at a certain point in our lives. If people start a restaurant or any business in their twenties, there's much more ego; but I think we had already been there in a way. We're more, I don't know, grown up.' The waiters help with the food preparation, the staff eat the same food as the customers, and (prices apart, of course) the place seems open and egalitarian in spirit. Still, on the basis that most utopias fade on closer inspection, I asked Rose and Ruth if I might work for a day in their kitchen. When I arrive, togged up in my chef's whites, Rose is working up a lunch menu. 'Do we write \"live\" langoustines,' she asks? 'I can't remember.' 'Well, they're not live once they've been on the grill,' someone says helpfully. Like any good New Labour chef, Gray takes care with presentation. 'Certain words,' she says, 'are guaranteed to shift things. \"Wood-roasted\" is always good. If we say \"Romana\" we're sure to sell a few more.' She and Ruth take it in turns to run the kitchen and today Rose is on lunch and Ruth on dinner. They have recently returned from completing their book and talk with a sense of relief to be back cooking after three months locked in a room with each other 'from half eight in the morning until whisky time at about seven in the evening'. Their partnership, they both say, is like a marriage. 'It's a very intense relationship. I suppose there is a kind of unspoken language between us,' Rose explains. That language is partly one of evangelical connoisseurship. Talk to either of them for any length of time and you are assailed with stories of this wonderful artichoke or that incredible risotto. Mention a turbot dish and Rose will tell you about the relationship they have with a number of south-coast fishing boats and how they go to different boats on different days depending on what they hear is good. (All their fish are line caught; fish get bruised in nets.) Ask what's in a pork recipe and she'll talk about a farmer in Suffolk who puts his Middlewhite sow with different pigs in a constant effort to improve the flavour of The River Cafe pork loin. Rose has, she explains, just returned from a few days at a wine-tasting event in Verona, at one stage trying 86 wines in a day - 'You know, blue teeth and purple mouth.' She shows me a notebook in which she notes her reactions to everything placed in front of her in a careful Elizabeth David-like hand that only gets slightly more gregarious as the day progresses. She and Ruth are jackdaws of Italian cuisine. They visit Italy every six weeks or so, persuading olive oil suppliers to show them what they do with peas, foraging in nettle beds for long-lost salad ingredients. As if to prove the point, Rose then sets me off preparing some puntarelle, a relation of the dandelion, with which she is going to make a salad 'in the traditional Roman style'. She is messianic about good natural ingredients. She talks of the restaurant's new vegetable garden. 'We're the only place that's got one,' she says. In her spare time, she designs gardens in her head; it all goes back, she says, to her growing up in Surrey during the war, 'with this fabulous vegetable garden. There was all sorts of rationing, but I saw how you could make good things from simple seasonal ingredients.' In the kitchen, meanwhile, the talk is of top-secret plans for Jamie Oliver's forthcoming stag night - Oliver was a former puntarelle peeler, as was Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall of TV dinners fame (if you want to be a star these days, shell peas) - and, at my prompting, of the differences between Rose and Ruth's ways of running the kitchen. 'Rose is more cerebral,' someone says, 'she can visualise tastes in her head. She'll come back with a sack of beans or a bag of a particular flour and have a very clear idea of what she wants you to do with it. She also does things last minute. Ruth tends to strip things to their essentials more, aims to keep things simpler, but wants to plan.' Or, says someone else: 'Rose is a bit more suspicious; Ruth's better at PR'. Or: 'Rose is far more confident than Ruth; Ruth is sometimes less sure of her decisions.' The kitchen is agreed on two things. First that 'It's mental when they are working together; they did a night a while back where one was on the grill and one was up front: madness.' And, second, all suitably on message, that they could not have landed in a more enlightened kitchen. There is talk of food parcels being delivered to them when they are ill; annual trips to Italy to taste olive oil. 'Where else would you get that?' Of her own style of running the kitchen, Rose says that she's 'capable of barking at people if its not running properly. Sometimes you have a chef who goes silent on you and you have to try to keep them all communicating, pull them out of themselves.' There is not a great deal of need for barking this lunchtime, however. Business is slow - only 45 covers (they can do 130 in the summer, when the garden is open) - a fact which Rose blames on the blip in the American stock market. 'Everyone has stayed by their screens,' she says. But, despite the global economic downturn, my expertly prepared puntarelle sells like hot sambucca. When Ruth arrives in the afternoon, double kissing me, a cardigan around her shoulders, the atmosphere changes a little. She sits down with her young assistant chef, Arthur, and constructs an evening menu partly based on what has gone well at lunchtime. There is much talk of dark plates, and of light plates. Borlotti beans travel up and down the menu, alternatively inserted and erased by Rogers, sucking her pencil. Arthur's role is mainly to enthuse, but occasionally he disagrees with a dish, offering suggestions of his own. ('The great thing here is that everyone has a say,' he tells me. 'If you said that kind of thing to Gordon Ramsay he'd just tell you to fuck off.') Ruth Rogers gives off a kind of palpable and charming nervous energy. She sets me off chopping asparagus, and tells me how she's just been on the phone to my editor, to talk about a skiing trip she's taking the next day with Richard and his five sons (Ab, Ben and Zad from his first marriage; Roo and Bo with Ruth.) She shows me how to make a perfect pear tart, all the while chivvying her staff. She reveals to me the precise moment for dispatching the caramel part of her signature caramel ice cream. ('If someone hasn't shouted \"something's burning\", then its not done'.) She laughs off my suggestions that she is running the country from her flame grill, but then admits that the previous night she had dinner with Alan Yentob, creative director of BBC1 and Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian . She introduces me to her kitchen staff and puts her hand over their mouths when they jokingly threaten to reveal indiscretions ('And me a patron of Index on Censorship'). Her friends tend to fall over themselves with superlatives to describe Ruth. Certainly, she seems to have led the most charmed of lives. She grew up in 'Woodstock of all places' in the 60s, the child of wealthy anti-Vietnam radicals. She met and fell for Richard in 1969, when she was in England and 19. At the time, Rogers, 15 years her senior, was married (to the architect Su Brumwell) and was earning \u00a32,000 a year teaching at the Architectural Association. Not long after Ruth moved in, however, he had his amazing break: winning the competition to design the Pompidou Centre in Paris. Ruth resigned from her job in the design department at Penguin Books and went to join him in Paris. They lived in the Place des Vosges, had their first child in 1975, and never looked back. 'Ruthie wore very bright colours when we first met,' her husband recalls. 'Students used to ask me what came first: my wife's clothes or the colours of my buildings. The truth is that she did have a big influence on that.' If she brought colour to Rogers's life she also set about bringing it to the friends she met with her husband. She hosted parties including famous Thanksgiving dinners for fellow ex-pats like Doris Saatchi and Ed Victor. She organised political campaigns, notably 'the friends of Salman Rushdie' with her great ally the socialite publisher Caroline Michel, enlisting the support of the Yentobs and the Bertoluccis, Jacob Rothschild and Melvyn Bragg, among others. And she started the restaurant. Her inspiration came form her husband's mother, Dada, who died last year. Rose had known Richard long before he met Ruth and was already a disciple of his mother's cooking. Ruth was bought up to think that Italian cooking was meatballs and she was overwhelmed by what Richard's family ate. 'Dada came from a very very wealthy family in Trieste,' she says. 'She grew up in that period when James Joyce was there, and Italo Svevo, and she married Richard's father who was a Florentine. With the onset of war, they came to London. And there she was, this Italian girl lifted out of Florence and plonked down in a bedsit behind Paddington station. She spent her whole time trying to find things here that she could cook.' In the early days of The River Cafe, Dada would come in and taste what Ruth and Rose were making. She always used to say: 'Too many herbs; too much butter keep it simple, simple.' And just before she died, she called Ruth to her bedside. 'Pretty much her last words to me were: go easy on the herbs, not so many herbs,' smiles Ruth. You can see a bit of Dada in Ruth as she cooks, trying to keep things simple. However often she does it, she says, she still gets a little adrenaline as eight o'clock comes around. 'It's like I imagine the theatre to be,' she says. But by the time the sun is setting over the Harrod's Depository opposite, she seems in her element. 'People think it must be so stressful because they get stressed out by cooking dinner for 10 people. But the most exhausting thing for us is seeing accountants or looking after the staff properly. Cooking is the fun part, the relaxing part.' Her lowest point, she says, was discovering that she had cooked a risotto for General Pinochet some years ago. She had, she remembers, thought the Spanish speaking party was 'just another royal family with their bodyguards'. When she found out 'my blood went cold and I was in tears... I'd poured my heart into this dictator's risotto.' Other than dictators, the only guests she dreads are Italian chefs. A while ago, the writer Adam Gopnik opined in The New Yorker that 'the best Italian food to be had in Europe was on the banks of the Thames'. All the Italian restaurateurs in London came and sat at the bar here and told us that what we were cooking was not Italian: 'You know, where is the Bolognese?' The closest she comes to a crisis this evening though, is a shortage of chard. Some nights, she says, 'it's just like a big dinner party - but then that's the idea really.' Working with Rogers and Gray you could convince yourself that you get a tiny glimpse of a more perfect world. It's only a restaurant, of course, but it's one in which all families are happy and all vegetables are fresh and all conversation is interesting. They get many people asking them why they don't open another restaurant, and they say there are two reasons: 'The first is that it would be impossible to find anywhere as beautiful as this; and the other is that you suddenly dilute your identity. It's nice having a piece of work that is wholly your own.' Like all successful recipes, this one depends on its main ingredients. In a rare moment, when they sit down together, I ask them to choose a single adjective to describe each other. 'Beautiful,' says Rose of Ruth. 'That was going to be mine,' says Ruth. She thinks for a while. 'Excellent,' she says. Like married couples, they say they have grown alike: 'Well, we both wear the same clothes,' says Rose, 'so to that extent, yes.' 'Sometimes, says Ruth, 'I hear myself talking and I think, \"Oh God, I sound like Rose.\"' 'You mean you sound excellent,' says Rose. 'Yes, of course,' says her friend, 'I sound excellent.' And they both giggle like schoolgirls.

I like to keep away from the whole business as much as I can. It is not important to me. I love to design clothes, but I try to do it differently and I work very quickly. I feel you have to like people when you design. I try to imagine who the person wearing it would be, I put myself in their place. I especially like designing for men. Like David Bowie. I saw him at a concert in Paris and I thought he was very badly dressed. I'd loved him for years, of course, like everyone has who loves music. So I wrote him a note saying, 'You are very badly dressed', and I sent him a pair of leather jeans. He liked them so much he ordered another four pairs and asked me to dress him for his 50th birthday party at Madison Square Garden. </p> <p>My real loves, though, are art, film and music. With artists I admire, I like to meet their work first. This is how I met Douglas. In Paris in 1996, I saw a piece of his work called 30 Second Text . You go into a dark cupboard and the light stays on for only 30 seconds, in which time you have to read the text on the screen. Apparently, 30 seconds is the time it takes for the head to die after it has been cut from the body. I mean, I was born in Versailles, so it held a special interest for me. It was the way people were killed in France until the 20th century. That got me very interested - I wanted to know him through this piece. I began to explore other pieces of his work, and then we kept bumping into each other in different cities, Berlin, New York, Paris, and we would carry on the conversation we left off from the last time. He has contributed to my art magazine, Le Point d'Ironie . It is a free magazine and each time we print 100,000 copies, and each time a different artist produces it. He is always so kind to me. When I was in New York and his show hadn't yet opened, he called me up to invite me to see it early. </p> <p>I was one of the producers on Gordon's piece of work, Feature Film , which came out last year. It is a very beautiful film and concentrates on the Bernard Herrmann music from the Alfred Hitchcock film, Vertigo . The whole film is built around the conducting of the score by James Conlon, who is an amazingly charismatic man and who actually looks a lot like Douglas - he could be his uncle. I am organising screenings in Paris because I want very much for people to see it. My love of film has led me to make six little stories of my own, which I recently filmed in New York, of different people wearing my clothes. I filmed and edited it myself. I am very proud of this because this skill is so new to me. I hope to show them in London soon. </p> <p>Douglas and I generally see each other when he is in Paris or I visit Britain. When I was on the judging panel for the Edinburgh Film Festival last summer, we had a little time to spend with each other, and recently we have both been judging the Beck's Future Award for Film and Video. I wanted especially to be involved in this award because it encourages younger artists who aren't particularly well known. That's why I make a point of collecting young artists' pieces, it is very encouraging for them. We don't tend to meet up with each others' families, although I have met Douglas's girlfriend and I liked her very much. I think of Douglas and myself as electrons libres , free neutrons. </p> <p> <strong> Douglas Gordon: </strong> I was, of course, aware of Agn\u00e8s's clothes before I knew her. I used to go into her shops and look around longingly, knowing that I could never afford them. Luckily, I've got one or two items now. She's also agreed to help mend an old leather jacket of mine that I am very fond of, but which has huge holes in it. </p> <p>When we first met, about five years ago, I remember Agn\u00e8s ordered a glass of Champagne and I ordered a vodka martini, and so immediately we started talking about James Bond and then we continued to talk about cinema for the next two hours. She has a huge knowledge of film and art. The friendship grew over a number of meetings. I go to Paris quite often. Feature Film was filmed there. It took five years, from the initial idea to the first projection, to complete. It was funny, because during filming, members of the orchestra kept coming up and asking if they'd seen my last film, and I'd never made a film before, so I kept saying, 'Oh, you wouldn't have heard of it'. James Conlon was a great find as the conductor. I don't know much about the classical music world, and so I just went on the internet and found the best-looking guy. I didn't know whether he'd be a good conductor or not. Luckily, not only was he a great conductor but he had a real cinematic quality. </p> <p>I've just returned from a very hectic three weeks in Paris, where my latest exhibition, Sheep and Goats, has just opened at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Modern. I have not exhibited at Agn\u00e8s's gallery yet, but she keeps urging me to. I like to think that we work together in ways that are not necessarily within the confines of four walls, not in terms of a gallery space. As soon as you put four walls around a situation, then it doesn't remain as open. She is very supportive and her explanations of my work are often far better than my own. It was great to have her as one of the producers on Feature Film . I like working in Paris, and it was the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Modern that approached me about my latest exhibition. They asked me to do the show maybe three years ago, and I put it off three times, but now I think it's right. I find that in countries like France or Germany, there are better facilities to make bigger shows. There was nowhere, really, in London that I could have exhibited Sheep and Goats. It might be better when the Tate Modern opens, hopefully it will change the landscape there. I am putting on a smaller show at the Liverpool Tate Gallery, though, in June. </p> <p>I'm based in Glasgow, but I did live in London during the second recession, between 1988 and 1990. Though I don't feel the need to live there any more, I still pop down more or less every weekend. I don't really perceive a 'London Art Scene'. People like Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas are just people who I have a drink with. It's the same in Glasgow. I don't think anybody who works internationally perceives a scene. It's more likely you would meet up with these people in Berlin or New York or Paris. </p> <p>Because Agn\u00e8s and I share a great love of the cinema, especially Alfred Hitchcock, we tend to send each other films that we think the other should see. I am looking forward to seeing her six short films she made in New York. I won't give her any advice, though - I don't tend to advise anybody about anything.</p>",

I don't think anybody who works internationally perceives a scene. It's more likely you would meet up with these people in Berlin or New York or Paris. Because Agn\u00e8s and I share a great love of the cinema, especially Alfred Hitchcock, we tend to send each other films that we think the other should see. I am looking forward to seeing her six short films she made in New York. I won't give her any advice, though - I don't tend to advise anybody about anything.",

      "bodyText": "KD of Hull raises the question of when it is reasonable to ask for compensation, beyond reimbursing losses, after a financial institution has caused you concern. He was prompted by a reader (Your Problems , 26 March) who lost his house deeds in the fire that destroyed thousands of Bradford &amp; Bingley documents: 'The question of compensation has arisen a number of times and I think it is a natural and genuine reaction. After all, while title to the property may be restored, many will not be absolutely sure there will not be problems in the future, perhaps after their death. I raised the compensation issue after my deeds were lost in the fire and received the same response. I was not seeking a large sum, more a token to acknowledge the worry and anxiety my wife and I were put through. In the end, I sent the society a bill for the time and effort in searching out documents and attending our solicitors to make a statutory declaration. The bill was paid.'",

You could be forced to postpone your retirement for up to five years if Government plans to curb early retirement go ahead. </p> <p>The proposals, published last week by the Government's Performance and Innovation Unit, will raise the minimum age at which you can draw an income from a private pension scheme. The state retirement age - which triggers payment of the basic state pension - will remain at 65.

The employer can avoid making a redundancy payment and any additional payments made to the employee's occupational pension will come from the pension fund rather than the employer's pocket. Although the employer will probably still have to pick up the bill for this later on, the perception is that such a move costs less money. </p> <p>However, 60 per cent of those between 50 and the state pensionable age who are not working have no occupational pension, and many others have inadequately funded pensions. They cannot receive the state pension before the age of 60 for women (rising to 65 between the years 2010 and 2020) and 65 for men, and many claim state benefits to survive. According to the Performance and Innovation Unit, 2.8 million people between 50 and the state pension age are not working. Of these, 2 million claim state benefits designed to replace income from work, and only 300,000 are actively seeking work. </p> <p>In practice, very few people can afford to retire before 55. But the Government is also keen to encourage people over the age of 50 to 'downshift' - working shorter hours and supplementing their earnings by drawing partial pensions. </p> <p>Although occupational pension rules do not allow people over 50 to work reduced hours and receive a part-pension while working for the same firm, the Inland Revenue has agreed in principle to change this. </p> <p>However, unions and trade associations attacked the plans this week, claiming that the Government would be limiting employees' choice, in some cases forcing them to continue working after they had burnt out.

      "body": "<p>House price indices are being obsessively followed by Britain's middle classes. New figures out this week will be seen as indicators of economic activity and used by thousands of households to help them decide whether to buy or sell. So how are house price indices calculated - and are we right to trust them? </p> <p>There are three authoritative national house price indices, run by the Halifax, Nationwide, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. </p> <p>Surprisingly the Government's figures are rarely quoted and lack the authority in the industry accorded the Halifax and Nationwide surveys. This is because it bases its monthly and quarterly results on completion prices. With house sales taking up to four months to complete, this means the DETR figures reflect an out-of-date position. </p> <p>The Halifax and Nationwide figures are based on mortgage offers made by the two firms and reflect a much more contemporary trend. Both companies exclude certain properties from their calculations: </p> <p>\u0095 houses costing \u00a31m-plus, most of which are bought without a mortgage </p> <p>\u0095 ex-council houses bought for the first time (re-sales are counted) </p> <p>\u0095 large, untypical houses (the Halifax, for example, excludes properties with 20 rooms or more) </p> <p>\u0095 re-mortgages </p> <p>\u0095 any property with a commercial element </p> <p>'These are only a few per cent of all our mortgages each month, but it is important that we exclude anything which stops the property being regarded as a free-market transaction,' says Stephen Rothwell, a statistician for the Halifax. </p> <p>The Halifax says that during recent busy months up to 20,000 mortgage offers have been made - not far off the 25,000 peaks of the past. Before the recent boom, the index was based on about 12,000 offers a month. </p> <p>The companies break down each property into its constituent parts (for example, the number of toilets) to allow a process called 'standardisation'. This takes into account the fact that properties built at different times will have different facilities - newer properties, for example, have more toilets. </p> <p>These constituent parts are then weighted to allow average price rises to be calculated in a geographical area, irrespective of whether the houses sold were mainly new, old or a mix. </p> <p>The Halifax and Nationwide lists vary slightly, but the main constituent parts are: </p> <p>\u0095 purchase price </p> <p>\u0095 location - the part of the country, and the perceived status of the area </p> <p>\u0095 floor size </p> <p>\u0095 property design (eg, detached house, terraced, or bungalow) </p> <p>\u0095 tenure </p> <p>\u0095 number of bathrooms </p> <p>\u0095 type of central heating, if any </p> <p>\u0095 number of bedrooms </p> <p>\u0095 age of property </p> <p>Figures are also seasonally adjusted according to the time of year when the mortgage offer is made, because prices are slightly higher in the spring and summer irrespective of the overall trend. </p> <p>The Nationwide says June is generally the strongest month for house prices and January the weakest. </p> <p>'Indices are very much general indicators of what goes on in the market,' says Nationwide group economist Alex Bannister. 'People must look at them for a trend, not to see what's happening to their own property. That would be a bit like looking at the Retail Price Index to work out the price of bread,' he says. </p> <p>Both firms issue national figures each month, covering a range of property sales - for example, all residential properties, or only those bought by first-time buyers, or only those bought by existing owner-occupiers. </p> <p>Regional figures - covering property types, too, such as terraced or semi-detached - are issued each quarter. Even then, some local areas do not feature every quarter if the number of offers made by the company in that area was too few to satisfy rigorous statistical criteria. </p> <p>The dependence on one company making sufficient mortgage offers in any period is seen by some housing industry experts as a weakness in the existing indices. This is particularly true in Northern Ireland, where there is a higher proportion of local independent estate agents than in the rest of the UK. </p> <p>The University of Ulster's Centre for Research on Property and Planning issues a quarterly price index for Northern Ireland based on valuations of properties being sold through about 100 estate agents' offices. The different approach produces dramatically different figures over most quarterly periods, with the University of Ulster figures usually being higher - a result local estate agents, unsurprisingly, prefer. 'I feel it's the most accurate reflection of house price increases in Northern Ireland since it incorporates details of all properties sold by a substantial number of estate agents,' says Gault Ervine, a partner in Ulster Property Sales, which has 13 offices across the province. </p> <p>None of these figures is wrong, but the variations show the need to treat such indices with caution. </p> <p>'People must realise these are simply trends,' says the Halifax's Stephen Rothwell.

      "bodyText": "House price indices are being obsessively followed by Britain's middle classes. New figures out this week will be seen as indicators of economic activity and used by thousands of households to help them decide whether to buy or sell. So how are house price indices calculated - and are we right to trust them? There are three authoritative national house price indices, run by the Halifax, Nationwide, and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Surprisingly the Government's figures are rarely quoted and lack the authority in the industry accorded the Halifax and Nationwide surveys. This is because it bases its monthly and quarterly results on completion prices. With house sales taking up to four months to complete, this means the DETR figures reflect an out-of-date position. The Halifax and Nationwide figures are based on mortgage offers made by the two firms and reflect a much more contemporary trend. Both companies exclude certain properties from their calculations: \u0095 houses costing \u00a31m-plus, most of which are bought without a mortgage \u0095 ex-council houses bought for the first time (re-sales are counted) \u0095 large, untypical houses (the Halifax, for example, excludes properties with 20 rooms or more) \u0095 re-mortgages \u0095 any property with a commercial element 'These are only a few per cent of all our mortgages each month, but it is important that we exclude anything which stops the property being regarded as a free-market transaction,' says Stephen Rothwell, a statistician for the Halifax. The Halifax says that during recent busy months up to 20,000 mortgage offers have been made - not far off the 25,000 peaks of the past. Before the recent boom, the index was based on about 12,000 offers a month. The companies break down each property into its constituent parts (for example, the number of toilets) to allow a process called 'standardisation'. This takes into account the fact that properties built at different times will have different facilities - newer properties, for example, have more toilets. These constituent parts are then weighted to allow average price rises to be calculated in a geographical area, irrespective of whether the houses sold were mainly new, old or a mix. The Halifax and Nationwide lists vary slightly, but the main constituent parts are: \u0095 purchase price \u0095 location - the part of the country, and the perceived status of the area \u0095 floor size \u0095 property design (eg, detached house, terraced, or bungalow) \u0095 tenure \u0095 number of bathrooms \u0095 type of central heating, if any \u0095 number of bedrooms \u0095 age of property Figures are also seasonally adjusted according to the time of year when the mortgage offer is made, because prices are slightly higher in the spring and summer irrespective of the overall trend. The Nationwide says June is generally the strongest month for house prices and January the weakest. 'Indices are very much general indicators of what goes on in the market,' says Nationwide group economist Alex Bannister. 'People must look at them for a trend, not to see what's happening to their own property. That would be a bit like looking at the Retail Price Index to work out the price of bread,' he says. Both firms issue national figures each month, covering a range of property sales - for example, all residential properties, or only those bought by first-time buyers, or only those bought by existing owner-occupiers. Regional figures - covering property types, too, such as terraced or semi-detached - are issued each quarter. Even then, some local areas do not feature every quarter if the number of offers made by the company in that area was too few to satisfy rigorous statistical criteria. The dependence on one company making sufficient mortgage offers in any period is seen by some housing industry experts as a weakness in the existing indices. This is particularly true in Northern Ireland, where there is a higher proportion of local independent estate agents than in the rest of the UK. The University of Ulster's Centre for Research on Property and Planning issues a quarterly price index for Northern Ireland based on valuations of properties being sold through about 100 estate agents' offices. The different approach produces dramatically different figures over most quarterly periods, with the University of Ulster figures usually being higher - a result local estate agents, unsurprisingly, prefer. 'I feel it's the most accurate reflection of house price increases in Northern Ireland since it incorporates details of all properties sold by a substantial number of estate agents,' says Gault Ervine, a partner in Ulster Property Sales, which has 13 offices across the province. None of these figures is wrong, but the variations show the need to treat such indices with caution. 'People must realise these are simply trends,' says the Halifax's Stephen Rothwell. 'A lot of people appeal against their council tax bands and try to use the index figures over the past several years. But we tell them that the figures are only regional, and there are huge differences within each region and sometimes even within a street.'

      "body": "<p>Homeowners without fixed-rate loans should brace themselves for another rise in homeloan costs, but not all economists think it will come this week. </p> <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets on Wednesday to decide whether to raise the bank base rate from 6 per cent. The MPC's decision will be announced on Thursday. </p> <p>The base rate has already increased from 5 per cent last September and economists believe it will go higher yet but are uncertain whether the next step will come immediately. </p> <p>Michael Saunders at investment bank Salomon Smith Barney says the strength of the pound, and the latest figures on gross domestic product, released on Friday, have convinced him otherwise. 'I was going for a hike but, with the pound and GDP where they are, I am going for no change.' </p> <p>Dharshini David at HSBC agrees, although she predicts that rates will peak at 6.5 per cent. </p> <p>David Brickman at PaineWebber says: 'I'm going for a 0.25 per cent rise but it's pretty close.' </p> <p>He believes the economy is now slowing down but thinks the monetary authorities may choose to raise rates again 'to get it over and done with'. </p> <p>Steven Pearson, an economist with the largest mortgage lender, Halifax Bank, is also plumping for a 0.25 percentage point rise. </p> <p>One of the many factors that the Bank of England will be considering is the outlook on house prices and statistics due out from Halifax and Nationwide this week. Pearson says the market is slowing, but not at the rate the Bank had included in its forecasts of future inflation. </p> <p>Mortgage adviser Patrick Bunton says activity in the mortgage market has slowed, but he is nevertheless predicting that mortgage rates will rise this week. 'I think we will see a 0.25 per cent rise in base rate and the same on mortgages.' </p> <p>A rise of 0.25 percentage points would raise the standard variable rate at Halifax, and most other major lenders from 7.74 per cent to a whisker below 8 per cent. For Halifax borrowers this would raise repayments on a \u00a350,000 25-year repayment loan by \u00a38.29 a month to \u00a3389.99 a month. On a \u00a3100,000 loan, payments would rise by \u00a316.60 to \u00a3779.99. </p> <p>Bunton believes that regardless of what happens this week, people on variable rate loans should be trying to cut costs. Competition in the market remains fierce - 'there is a scrap going on for market share' - and there are attractive deals available at lower than the variable rate. </p> <p>He does not recommend five-year fixed rates because borrowers could end up paying too much because rates will come down again within that period. </p> <p>But two-year fixed rates are attractive, and two-year discounts even more so. Staffordshire building society is offering a 2.01 per cent discount, which has a starting rate of 5.49 per cent and there are no early redemption penalties. National Counties has a three-year discount of 1.4 per cent to give a starting rate of 5.79 per cent and there are no redemption penalties after the three years. </p> <p>Bunton calculates that someone with an \u00a380,000 mortgage paying 7.74 per cent would save \u00a3130 a month by switching to the National Counties deal. This works out at almost \u00a34,700 over the three years. </p> <p>'Anyone paying the variable rate is shredding money.' </p> <p>Ray Boulger at broker John Charcol says it is difficult to predict the outcome of this week's rate decision by the MPC. 'It's a particularly difficult one to call. My gut feeling is that the rate will go up a quarter of a point but it's not something I want to put money on.' </p> <p>Even if homeloan costs do go up this week, the good news for home owners is that the end is now in sight for rises. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Homeowners without fixed-rate loans should brace themselves for another rise in homeloan costs, but not all economists think it will come this week. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets on Wednesday to decide whether to raise the bank base rate from 6 per cent. The MPC's decision will be announced on Thursday. The base rate has already increased from 5 per cent last September and economists believe it will go higher yet but are uncertain whether the next step will come immediately. Michael Saunders at investment bank Salomon Smith Barney says the strength of the pound, and the latest figures on gross domestic product, released on Friday, have convinced him otherwise. 'I was going for a hike but, with the pound and GDP where they are, I am going for no change.' Dharshini David at HSBC agrees, although she predicts that rates will peak at 6.5 per cent. David Brickman at PaineWebber says: 'I'm going for a 0.25 per cent rise but it's pretty close.' He believes the economy is now slowing down but thinks the monetary authorities may choose to raise rates again 'to get it over and done with'. Steven Pearson, an economist with the largest mortgage lender, Halifax Bank, is also plumping for a 0.25 percentage point rise. One of the many factors that the Bank of England will be considering is the outlook on house prices and statistics due out from Halifax and Nationwide this week. Pearson says the market is slowing, but not at the rate the Bank had included in its forecasts of future inflation. Mortgage adviser Patrick Bunton says activity in the mortgage market has slowed, but he is nevertheless predicting that mortgage rates will rise this week. 'I think we will see a 0.25 per cent rise in base rate and the same on mortgages.' A rise of 0.25 percentage points would raise the standard variable rate at Halifax, and most other major lenders from 7.74 per cent to a whisker below 8 per cent. For Halifax borrowers this would raise repayments on a \u00a350,000 25-year repayment loan by \u00a38.29 a month to \u00a3389.99 a month. On a \u00a3100,000 loan, payments would rise by \u00a316.60 to \u00a3779.99. Bunton believes that regardless of what happens this week, people on variable rate loans should be trying to cut costs. Competition in the market remains fierce - 'there is a scrap going on for market share' - and there are attractive deals available at lower than the variable rate. He does not recommend five-year fixed rates because borrowers could end up paying too much because rates will come down again within that period. But two-year fixed rates are attractive, and two-year discounts even more so. Staffordshire building society is offering a 2.01 per cent discount, which has a starting rate of 5.49 per cent and there are no early redemption penalties. National Counties has a three-year discount of 1.4 per cent to give a starting rate of 5.79 per cent and there are no redemption penalties after the three years. Bunton calculates that someone with an \u00a380,000 mortgage paying 7.74 per cent would save \u00a3130 a month by switching to the National Counties deal. This works out at almost \u00a34,700 over the three years. 'Anyone paying the variable rate is shredding money.' Ray Boulger at broker John Charcol says it is difficult to predict the outcome of this week's rate decision by the MPC. 'It's a particularly difficult one to call. My gut feeling is that the rate will go up a quarter of a point but it's not something I want to put money on.' Even if homeloan costs do go up this week, the good news for home owners is that the end is now in sight for rises.",

In the Eighties, Szab\u00f3 directed Mephisto, Colonel Redl and Hanussen , three remarkable films about the interaction between private lives and public events during middle-Europe's period of cataclysmic political change from the turn of the century to the coming of the Third Reich. </p> <p>Szab\u00f3's trilogy, made in German, is among the major achievements of world cinema, with the great Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer starring in all three.

But the low-budget Sweet Emma, Dear B\u00f6be of the following year, the tale of two young Budapest teachers coping with problems attendant on the new freedom, is one of the best, most humane studies of the way ordinary East Europeans have experienced the collapse of communism. </p> <p>With Sunshine, his first picture for eight years, Szab\u00f3 returns to the big canvas and the large themes of our responsibility to ourselves, our families, the community and the state. As in the trilogy, he has a charismatic foreign actor playing three different characters. But here they're from successive generations of the same family, and the period covered is nearly 150 years from the mid-nineteenth century to the fall of communism. </p> <p>Because of the romantic aura, the marvellous images of Szab\u00f3's regular cinematographer, Lajos Koltai, the seductive score by Maurice Jarre and a succession of attractive performances, the picture holds one's attention for three hours. But it's thinner, more contrived and far less compelling than his oblique, complex trilogy. </p> <p>This is essentially a family saga, nearer in spirit to Herman Wouk than Thomas Mann, telling the story of a Jewish dynasty whose fortunes is founded on a best-selling health tonic called Sonnenschein ('Sunshine'), the secret recipe for which Emmanuel Sonnenschein (David de Keyser) brings to Budapest following the accidental death of his father, a tavern keeper in a small Hungarian village. </p> <p>His elder son, Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes), becomes a lawyer and in order to become a judge and to be assimilated into the state of the emperor he admires, he changes his name to the more acceptable 'Sors' (Hungarian for destiny).

Ignatz's son Adam, (Ralph Fiennes again), goes one further than his father in the Thirties by becoming a Catholic and thus eligible to join the fascistic military fencing club that will allow him to compete at the 1936 Olympics. However, neither converting nor becoming a national sports hero exempts him from the Holocaust. </p> <p>After the Second World War, Adam's son Ivan, (Fiennes once more), briefly throws in his lot with the vengeful communists until they turn out to be as anti-Semitic as earlier regimes and start purging Zionist conspirators in the party hierarchy. </p> <p>A hell of a lot of history is crammed into this picture - two world wars, several revolutions and counter revolutions, the collapse of two empires - and Szab\u00f3's central thrust is clear, though only up to a point. A liberal tolerance for human diversity is what he believes in. If he's saying that it's wicked to be a chameleon Vicar of Bray figure, fitting in with successive regimes to survive, where does he stand on reasonable compromise? Or is he by implication just endorsing Polonius's advice to Laertes (ie 'This above all; to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man')? </p> <p>I'm sure he doesn't intend to imply that because anti-Semitism is ineradicable, Jews must always be self conscious outsiders who deceive themselves if they think they are truly Hungarians or Germans. </p> <p>There are also problems in the film's patterning.

But after his return to form with Buena Vista Social Club Wenders has pressed the snooze button with The Million Dollar Hotel. This aimless affair is some sort of whimsical thriller and though the story is attributed to Nicholas Klein and Bono, it seems more like an extended homage to Shock Corridor, a minor classic by Wenders's mentor Sam Fuller in which a journalist feigns madness to solve a murder committed in an asylum that is clearly an image of America. Here a mentally disturbed semi-crippled FBI agent (Mel Gibson) investigates the death of a millionaire's son (an uncredited Tim Roth) at a seedy Los Angeles residential hotel inhabited by retards and misfits. Did he jump? Was he pushed? Do we care? The film moves at the pace of the London Eye and is a feast of over-acting. The ripest contribution is from Peter Stormare, sporting a Swedish-Scouse accent, as a musician who claims to have been the fifth Beatle and to have written Sergeant Pepper. In Claude Autant-Lara's En Cas de Maleur (1958) Brigitte Bardot gave one of her best performances as a teenage thief who seduces middle-aged lawyer Jean Gabin and ruins his life. This Georges Simenon novel has been filmed again by Pierre Jolivet as In All Innocence starring G\u00e9rard Lanvin as the attorney, Carole Bouquet as his wife and Virginie Ledoyen as the sex kitten. It's slick, watchable and none too interesting.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sainsbury's Bank is owned 55 per cent by J Sainsbury and 45 per cent by Bank of Scotland. Its stated aim is to offer exceptional customer service, value for money and 'flexibility other banks have failed to deliver'. It has more than 1 million customer accounts with deposits of over \u00a31.7 billion. </p> <p>Ahead of Tesco, by a whisker, into the field of banking, Sainsbury's Bank has a broad range of products, with an emphasis on mortgages and savings. </p> <p>The bank specialises in slightly off-beat mortgage products. They do not offer the lowest rates, but they are more flexible than average. They include an options mortgage which offers variable rates and allows customers to adapt their payments to suit their needs. This can mean paying over 10 months rather than 12, taking a 6-month break from repayments, or paying off more each month to reduce the cost of the loan, all with no penalty. Also, after three months, customers are able to take a further advance of 5 per cent of the value of the property, using an options mortgage personal cheque book. Savings can also be paid into the mortgage account, thus avoiding tax. </p> <p>Sainsbury's also does a fixed-rate mortgage (7.39 per cent for three or five years), with no lock-ins beyond the fixed rate period. It also does a hybrid fixed/variable rate, which allows customers to fix up to 50 per cent of borrowings for up to three years, and still benefit from the flexibility of the options mortgage. The variable rate is currently 6.95 per cent. There is also a discount variation, which combines the options mortgage with a 1 per cent discount for the first six months. </p> <p>Sainsbury's also has a 'buy to let' mortgage, which allows customers to buy up to five properties for rental with a 30 per cent deposit for each. The maximum total borrowing is \u00a3350,000 with an arrangement fee of \u00a3250 per loan. The current rate of 7.50 per cent is one of the best. </p> <p>Savings products include an instant access savings account.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's Bank is owned 55 per cent by J Sainsbury and 45 per cent by Bank of Scotland. Its stated aim is to offer exceptional customer service, value for money and 'flexibility other banks have failed to deliver'. It has more than 1 million customer accounts with deposits of over \u00a31.7 billion. Ahead of Tesco, by a whisker, into the field of banking, Sainsbury's Bank has a broad range of products, with an emphasis on mortgages and savings. The bank specialises in slightly off-beat mortgage products. They do not offer the lowest rates, but they are more flexible than average. They include an options mortgage which offers variable rates and allows customers to adapt their payments to suit their needs. This can mean paying over 10 months rather than 12, taking a 6-month break from repayments, or paying off more each month to reduce the cost of the loan, all with no penalty. Also, after three months, customers are able to take a further advance of 5 per cent of the value of the property, using an options mortgage personal cheque book. Savings can also be paid into the mortgage account, thus avoiding tax. Sainsbury's also does a fixed-rate mortgage (7.39 per cent for three or five years), with no lock-ins beyond the fixed rate period. It also does a hybrid fixed/variable rate, which allows customers to fix up to 50 per cent of borrowings for up to three years, and still benefit from the flexibility of the options mortgage. The variable rate is currently 6.95 per cent. There is also a discount variation, which combines the options mortgage with a 1 per cent discount for the first six months. Sainsbury's also has a 'buy to let' mortgage, which allows customers to buy up to five properties for rental with a 30 per cent deposit for each. The maximum total borrowing is \u00a3350,000 with an arrangement fee of \u00a3250 per loan. The current rate of 7.50 per cent is one of the best. Savings products include an instant access savings account. It pays 4.85 per cent on \u00a31-\u00a32,499; 5.10 per cent on \u00a32,500-\u00a39,999, 5.25 per cent on \u00a310,000-\u00a324,999 and 5.60 per cent on balances over \u00a325,000.The rates are competitive with many building societies and banks, and similar to those paid by Tesco.

Other new products include a personal contract purchase car scheme. Personal loans have not particularly enticing interest rates of 16.5 per cent APR for \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,999, 13.9 per cent for \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,999, 10.9 per cent for \u00a35,000 to \u00a39,999 and 9.9 per cent for \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000.

      "byline": "Robert Heller",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Managers and management gurus have all agreed on one sovereign point: that in a world of intense and growing competition, Brand is King. During the Nineties, the world's great brands duly grew enormously in value - for example, Coca-Cola's super-brand swelled to an apparent worth of $150 billion - the difference between its assets and its $169 billion market capitalisation. </p> <p>But the mighty are fallen indeed. Before the Easter gyrations on Wall Street, Coke had lost $62 billion of fizz, or 37 per cent in value. Another great brand, Gillette, fared even worse. Its capitalisation collapsed by half to $32 billion. The two downgraded companies have one other thing in common - both are core holdings of the world's master investor, the Sage of Omaha, multi-billionaire Warren Buffett. </p> <p>Both firms fit perfectly into Buffet's investment formula. He likes to invest Berkshire Hathaway's billions in worldwide brands which enjoy dominant shares of markets whose continued growth can be expected. </p> <p>Both companies have crashed into severe management problems after the loss of chief executives. To that extent, the setbacks may be temporary. But these are by no means the only troubled global brands. Is the Buffett formula fading - or even failing? The Brand-is-King theory always had an element of paradox, since consumer tastes in the Nineties, far from being committed to one brand, have steadily fragmented. Consumer power, too, was plainly on the increase. </p> <p>The New Millennium has tightened the screws. Consumers are continuing to gain power while the unluckier household names are struggling with eroding brands. Some of the erosion reflects the very competition that the 'power brand' is supposed to surmount. But other, more insidious forces are at work. They include the momentous events in cyberspace. None of the e-retailers is especially large in sales, but combined they are moving enough goods to skim some cream off bricks-and-mortar profits. It only takes a 10 per cent shift in trade to push many stores into loss. </p> <p>Whatever the reason, the High Street brands - such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Somerfield and Arcadia - have been in deep trouble. But such travails need not mean that the brand is dying. It may merely be misunderstood, and consequently mismanaged. </p> <p>Focusing on the product brand is too narrow a concept. The true brand is the sum total of the perceptions of all the constituencies which contribute to revenues and profits. </p> <p>Among other insults to its constituents, Coke's now axed CEO Doug Ivester, alienated his powerful bottlers with extortionate price rises for syrup. That one of the affronted bottlers actually has the son of Coke's biggest investor, the even more powerful Buffett, on its board, adds stupidity to injury. </p> <p>As for M&amp;S, among many and varied failings, it alienated its middle-class shoppers with falling quality. Its subsequent reforms have driven home the point about the total brand. St. Michael, while dearly beloved by the Marksists themselves, was never really a brand. That honour went to Marks &amp; Spencer, or Marks &amp; Sparks, which has now been brought to the fore. The future hinges on whether management can restore the stores to their old reputation as places where high quality and excellent service provide high Value for Money - VFM, rather than absolute price being the critical factor. </p> <p>Research shows conclusively that customers desert even the strongest brand if prices rise above the perceived value. Loss of customer support is bound to be devastating. But you can't afford to lose support anywhere in a climate of rapidly proliferating alternatives. </p> <p>Employees, for example, are the visible face of the brand. The suppliers are its prime agents of quality - squeeze their prices or unceremoniously dump them and, as M&amp;S has found, there is trouble in store. Nor can you ignore the opinion-formers, who can rapidly undermine any image. </p> <p>But even if brands are collectively losing power, their continuing high value in the marketplace is a reality. Killing a brand is much harder than killing a company. Who remembers the British Motor Corporation, or British Leyland, or Austin-Morris? Yet just one brand rescued from these hulks, MG, emerged from decades of neglect as the core of Alchemy's controversial plans for the Rover Group. </p> <p>The Internet entrepreneurs know all about the permanence of brand value. Their massive marketing spends are intended to reinforce 'word of mouse' and 'share of mind' - brand strength. The theory is that, if you capture the mouse clicks and the customer recognition early on, no competitor will break your grip on the market. In this view, what Microsoft did to Netscape's hold is an exception, impossible without equal monopoly power. The theory sounds convincing - but it cannot be fully tested in a still immature Internet marketplace . </p> <p>The Net giants may also face brand problems, which could prove more important in the long run than the bursting of their stock market bubbles. America OnLine, Amazon and e-Bay are very vulnerable to competition, as AOL found when confronting free internet service providers. Competitors do not need to attack on a broad front. They can pick off succulent sectors, gaining customers who have already been made internet-friendly by the big brands. </p> <p>Brands are never safe unless there is compelling reason for customers to buy from you and nobody else - look what happened to IBM. It lost 70 per cent of its market share once corporate buyers realised that they could buy perfectly good alternatives without risk. The essence of today's marketplace is that perfectly good alternatives exist for everything - even Coke. The total brand is only as good as the total company that owns it. Total goodness is the true King.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Managers and management gurus have all agreed on one sovereign point: that in a world of intense and growing competition, Brand is King. During the Nineties, the world's great brands duly grew enormously in value - for example, Coca-Cola's super-brand swelled to an apparent worth of $150 billion - the difference between its assets and its $169 billion market capitalisation. But the mighty are fallen indeed. Before the Easter gyrations on Wall Street, Coke had lost $62 billion of fizz, or 37 per cent in value. Another great brand, Gillette, fared even worse. Its capitalisation collapsed by half to $32 billion. The two downgraded companies have one other thing in common - both are core holdings of the world's master investor, the Sage of Omaha, multi-billionaire Warren Buffett. Both firms fit perfectly into Buffet's investment formula. He likes to invest Berkshire Hathaway's billions in worldwide brands which enjoy dominant shares of markets whose continued growth can be expected. Both companies have crashed into severe management problems after the loss of chief executives. To that extent, the setbacks may be temporary. But these are by no means the only troubled global brands. Is the Buffett formula fading - or even failing? The Brand-is-King theory always had an element of paradox, since consumer tastes in the Nineties, far from being committed to one brand, have steadily fragmented. Consumer power, too, was plainly on the increase. The New Millennium has tightened the screws. Consumers are continuing to gain power while the unluckier household names are struggling with eroding brands. Some of the erosion reflects the very competition that the 'power brand' is supposed to surmount. But other, more insidious forces are at work. They include the momentous events in cyberspace. None of the e-retailers is especially large in sales, but combined they are moving enough goods to skim some cream off bricks-and-mortar profits. It only takes a 10 per cent shift in trade to push many stores into loss. Whatever the reason, the High Street brands - such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Somerfield and Arcadia - have been in deep trouble. But such travails need not mean that the brand is dying. It may merely be misunderstood, and consequently mismanaged. Focusing on the product brand is too narrow a concept. The true brand is the sum total of the perceptions of all the constituencies which contribute to revenues and profits. Among other insults to its constituents, Coke's now axed CEO Doug Ivester, alienated his powerful bottlers with extortionate price rises for syrup. That one of the affronted bottlers actually has the son of Coke's biggest investor, the even more powerful Buffett, on its board, adds stupidity to injury. As for M&amp;S, among many and varied failings, it alienated its middle-class shoppers with falling quality. Its subsequent reforms have driven home the point about the total brand. St. Michael, while dearly beloved by the Marksists themselves, was never really a brand. That honour went to Marks &amp; Spencer, or Marks &amp; Sparks, which has now been brought to the fore. The future hinges on whether management can restore the stores to their old reputation as places where high quality and excellent service provide high Value for Money - VFM, rather than absolute price being the critical factor. Research shows conclusively that customers desert even the strongest brand if prices rise above the perceived value. Loss of customer support is bound to be devastating. But you can't afford to lose support anywhere in a climate of rapidly proliferating alternatives. Employees, for example, are the visible face of the brand. The suppliers are its prime agents of quality - squeeze their prices or unceremoniously dump them and, as M&amp;S has found, there is trouble in store. Nor can you ignore the opinion-formers, who can rapidly undermine any image. But even if brands are collectively losing power, their continuing high value in the marketplace is a reality. Killing a brand is much harder than killing a company. Who remembers the British Motor Corporation, or British Leyland, or Austin-Morris? Yet just one brand rescued from these hulks, MG, emerged from decades of neglect as the core of Alchemy's controversial plans for the Rover Group. The Internet entrepreneurs know all about the permanence of brand value. Their massive marketing spends are intended to reinforce 'word of mouse' and 'share of mind' - brand strength. The theory is that, if you capture the mouse clicks and the customer recognition early on, no competitor will break your grip on the market. In this view, what Microsoft did to Netscape's hold is an exception, impossible without equal monopoly power. The theory sounds convincing - but it cannot be fully tested in a still immature Internet marketplace . The Net giants may also face brand problems, which could prove more important in the long run than the bursting of their stock market bubbles. America OnLine, Amazon and e-Bay are very vulnerable to competition, as AOL found when confronting free internet service providers. Competitors do not need to attack on a broad front. They can pick off succulent sectors, gaining customers who have already been made internet-friendly by the big brands. Brands are never safe unless there is compelling reason for customers to buy from you and nobody else - look what happened to IBM. It lost 70 per cent of its market share once corporate buyers realised that they could buy perfectly good alternatives without risk. The essence of today's marketplace is that perfectly good alternatives exist for everything - even Coke. The total brand is only as good as the total company that owns it. Total goodness is the true King.",

      "body": "<p>Forget the emotional things like being nice to babies and kind to the environment. There are real financial benefits to Standard Life's policyholders from being a mutual insurance company. </p> <p>That assertion, by Standard's finance director Iain Lumsden, sets the tone for a two-month campaign to persuade its 2.3 million voting members that they should reject the proposal to turn itself into a public company and vote to keep it as Europe's largest mutual. </p> <p>It is a tough battle. Standard will have to persuade policyholders that their future benefits are worth more than the windfall payout they would receive on conversion. While it disputes the \u00a36,000 average payout estimated by Fred Woollard, the Monaco-based fund manager who has requisitioned the meeting, it does concede that a fifth of members will get more than \u00a36,000. Set that against the promise of a higher payout on a policy whose value is uncertain anyway and Woollard looks like an easy victor. Standard, however, has come out fighting. </p> <p>Its announcement of the special meeting, to be held on 27 June, shows that it is not averse to a play on policyholders' emotions. 'The benefits of mutuality should be preserved for both current and future members,' it says. For those who are more interested in their own finances than that of their grandchildren, it also provides a barrage of statistics to prove that mutual is best. </p> <p>Others disagree - and not just Woollard and his supporters. Many of Britain's largest mutuals - including Standard's rivals Norwich Union, Scottish Widows and Scottish Amicable as well as former building societies like the Halifax, Abbey National and the Woolwich have all opted for a stock market flotation or been taken over recently. </p> <p>So do Standard's arguments for mutuality stand up? The core is performance. Taking the average payout on a with-profits policy over the last 15 years as 100, the average proprietary life office - as shareholder-owned companies are known - pays out 97.3, the average mutual 102.6 and Standard Life, as one of the best of the mutuals, 106.9. And they are more efficient. For the average proprietary company, the cost of getting new business is over 97 per cent of premiums in the first year, 15.4 per cent in subsequent years. For mutuals, that falls to 75.8 per cent and 14.7 per cent respectively. </p> <p>Mutuals are also better at keeping their customers. More than 80 per cent of endowment policies sold by mutuals are still in force after four years - and 86.6 per cent of Standard Life's - compared with 75.4 per cent of mutuals. But averages do not show the whole picture. In a survey of past performance of with-profits policies by Money Management, the industry magazine, the three companies with the largest number of top 10 performances over the last 30 years were mutuals - Standard Life, Friends Provident and Equitable Life, and the next two only recently converted. </p> <p>But two of the three at the bottom of Money Management's table - Scottish Equitable and Reliance Mutual - are mutuals. And, while only three out of the 10 best performing with-profits policies over 10 years, maturing in February 2000, were proprietary companies, for 20 and 25-year policies, five were mutual and five proprietary. </p> <p>What that demonstrates is that there are good and bad among both mutuals and proprietary companies. Standard Life undoubtedly falls among the good, partly because of its size and its financial strength. Iain Lumsden estimates that it outperforms by enough to add 10 per cent to the final value of a Standard Life policy compared to rivals. </p> <p>For the average policyholder, that is worth about \u00a34,000 - not bad when compared with the \u00a32,500 Standard claims its members will get if it converts. </p> <p>But there are two problems with that. The first is that it is difficult to persuade policyholders they are really getting that extra benefit - after all, they will not know the value of their policy until it actually matures, so how can they be sure it is worth more to them if Standard stays a mutual? More seriously, would conversion to a public company mean that extra benefit would disappear? </p> <p>There are certainly signs that demutualisation affects performance. The Money Management survey suggests that the performances of Scottish Amicable and Norwich Union, which have demutualised over the past two years, are slipping. But that was partly the reason for their demutualisation. </p> <p>Earlier demutualisations have fared better. Scottish Mutual, which was acquired by Abbey National eight years ago, equalled Standard Life's top 10 appearances in the performance tables over the last decade. Building societies offer another lesson to the dwindling band of mutual life companies: the importance of making your members feel like owners. Until the demutualisations started, it was difficult to identify any real benefits of building society membership. Rates were little different to those available elsewhere and there was no real accountability. </p> <p>Mutual life offices suffer from the same problem. The controversy over demutualisation meant that a couple of hundred people turned up for last week's Standard Life annual meeting but that is a pitiful attendance given that it has 2.3 million members. But how many of these policyholders know they own the company, let alone have an idea of how to recognise these rights? </p> <p>Standard Life admits it has not done much to encourage its owners to participate in their company. That could well change during the course of this campaign. It is likely to look at all the options, from giving a more detailed explanation of exactly how much of the growth in owners' policies comes from a share of the profits which would have to be given away to shareholders to considering a customer reward scheme, like fellow mutual Wesleyan. </p> <p>Will that be enough to persuade policyholders to reject the carrot of free shares? Ned Cazalet, an independent insurance analyst, doubts it: 'A typical policyholder will be better off having shares.' Standard Life may warn that that will change when the policyholders have to share their profits with shareholders. </p> <p>But, as Cazalet points out, the policyholders will be the shareholders so they will get that extra share anyway - or the sale proceeds from their shares to compensate. Standard Life's campaign to stay mutual essentially rests on persuading us to ignore these short-term financial benefits for the long-term good of ourselves and our children. It is a hard argument to win. The future of mutuality depends on Standard Life managing it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forget the emotional things like being nice to babies and kind to the environment. There are real financial benefits to Standard Life's policyholders from being a mutual insurance company. That assertion, by Standard's finance director Iain Lumsden, sets the tone for a two-month campaign to persuade its 2.3 million voting members that they should reject the proposal to turn itself into a public company and vote to keep it as Europe's largest mutual. It is a tough battle. Standard will have to persuade policyholders that their future benefits are worth more than the windfall payout they would receive on conversion. While it disputes the \u00a36,000 average payout estimated by Fred Woollard, the Monaco-based fund manager who has requisitioned the meeting, it does concede that a fifth of members will get more than \u00a36,000. Set that against the promise of a higher payout on a policy whose value is uncertain anyway and Woollard looks like an easy victor. Standard, however, has come out fighting. Its announcement of the special meeting, to be held on 27 June, shows that it is not averse to a play on policyholders' emotions. 'The benefits of mutuality should be preserved for both current and future members,' it says. For those who are more interested in their own finances than that of their grandchildren, it also provides a barrage of statistics to prove that mutual is best. Others disagree - and not just Woollard and his supporters. Many of Britain's largest mutuals - including Standard's rivals Norwich Union, Scottish Widows and Scottish Amicable as well as former building societies like the Halifax, Abbey National and the Woolwich have all opted for a stock market flotation or been taken over recently.

The companies themselves are also a bit coy on numbers, although Yahoo.co.uk says its staffing has doubled in the last 12 months. What is clear is that numbers are snowballing and there is a skills shortage. A survey of IT managers by the online IT recruitment network Silicon.com found 47 per cent reporting vacancies. </p> <p>Some employers, like the one who recently advertised for someone with 'three years experience of Windows 2000', may be expecting too much but - as the industry grows - companies will have to look beyond the traditional geek. </p> <p>'The problem is recruiters are looking for an exact match,' says Robina Chatham of the Cranfield School of Managment. 'They shouldn't look for people with particular tools but just with the right aptitude.' That could be you. </p> <p>Amazon.co.uk, for example, intends to take on another 500 staff this year. Music merchandiser Helen Marquis joined the company from a branch of HMV. 'At university five years ago I was afraid of computers,' she admits. 'Now I'm working with them. I saw it as a natural progression from bricks and mortar as E commerce has a better future than the record shop. I wanted to be stretched and here my abilities are better appreciated. They trust me.' </p> <p>The feeling of liberation from traditional working styles and attitudes is at all levels. 'The job is a gift,' says Martine King, MD of Yahoo.co.uk who previously held senior positions in both radio and TV. 'People here are vibrant, passionate and they care.' Indeed, with bright gold name stars above each desk and on every door, Yahoo's current home is as much primary school classroom as the traditional office. Like many, King took a pay cut to join a dot.com. </p> <p>Nessa Curran is an operations analyst with Moonfruit.com, a new site-creation operation built around Macromedia's Flash technology which makes web-page design easier and more versatile. She joined at start-up. 'Nobody judged me by the fact that I'd spent three years bumming around in Spain and now I'm riding a tiger,' she says. Moonfruit has grown from three staff to 45 in six months. 'How could I be bored?' asks Curran. </p> <p>Indeed, with their flat hierarchies and open cultures, dot.coms are a little dot.commie. 'We have an open-door policy as there are no doors, 'says King, who works in the open-plan office. 'If you like the expensive trappings of the executive lifestyle, a dot.com isn't for you,' she says. Nick Young of Moonfruit says: 'If I want to talk to the CEO I just do it and things happen straight away. There is no chain of command. The CEO is the next desk anyway' This time last year Young was fretting over his university finals. </p> <p>An open working ethos is not exclusive to dot.coms, but Moonfruit takes it a little further. Former journalist Pat White, 58, brings a breadth and depth of experience to her 'unusual role'. 'I'm a sounding board,' she says. 'There are a lot of emotional problems caused by the fast pace of change and the rapid growth.' The marketing team's Richard Cook calls her 'the lighthouse'. </p> <p>He says: 'The hectic pace affects your life. Everything's 100 miles an hour here and you take that home. One minute you feel like a God, the next out of control. It takes courage to ask for help or admit mistakes. The honest, open approach isn't for everyone. You need to understand yourself well to handle it and Pat helps with that.' Moonfruit's CEO Wendy Tan, formerly at Egg, sees White's role as vital. 'The promise I've made all staff is that they should enjoy our journey wherever it goes,' she says. 'It's a culture of responsibility. If people want to pick up kids or go to the gym during the day, they can. It's about balance. Pat helps me achieve that.' </p> <p>But it is not just emotional problems that can be caused by the fast pace of change. Workplace consultant Kathy Tilney, of Tilney Shane, says: 'There is a tendency for offices to be overcrowded. As companies grow they shove in more people and more screens. We see back pain problems and repetitive strain injuries. </p> <p>'When businesses are run by people with little experience, as many dot.coms are, that can be very refreshing but the downside is that they may not be aware of all the legislation. Most of it exists for good reason - to protect staff health. You need to take a holistic approach. It's no good offering a relaxed environment if the desk is dangerous.' </p> <p>The holistic approach is important as many of these twenty-first century companies still work nineteenth century hours. Many staff report 12-hour days. This worries Nigel Stanley of the TUC. 'The dream might be retiring with a fortune at 30, but for the vast majority that isn't going to happen. They're more likely to be burnt out by 30. The dot.com image is a glamourous front for some pretty poorly paid, poorly unionised work in warehouses, call centres, delivery and so on.' </p> <p>While nobody still argues that the Internet is a passing fancy, the future of individual companies is less certain. It took nearly a century for the motor industry to consolidate from thousands of firms to a handful. It will surely happen more quickly in the new tech economy. 'My parents freaked at first,' says Cook. 'They have traditional jobs and worried that there was no security. Friends thought I was mad for stepping into the unknown but I felt like a pioneer.' </p> <p>'Before the capital was in place, we were worried about whether we'd get paid,' says his colleague Nessa Curran. 'We didn't even have offices at first. I was interviewed in a coffee shop and there were other dot.com meetings going on at every table.' </p> <p>The enthusiasm of people like Cook and Curran is undeniable and infectious. If commitment alone were enough Moonfruit - which has just secured its first revenue deal - would be massive. </p> <p>Of course, it is more dot.complex than that, but that coffee shop, if you are interested, is Coffee Republic, in London's Soho Square.</p>",

Unless Ipswich win at Charlton this afternoon the 30th anniversary of City's European Cup Winners' Cup triumph will be spent toasting a new league and a new era. </p> <p>Otherwise, as regular City-watchers will know, those of a nervous disposition would be advised to switch off now. For should Royle's charges be required to glean some sort of return at Blackburn next weekend the suspicion lingers that a team famed for aiming a 12-bore at their own toecaps could surpass themselves once again. </p> <p>On this evidence, however, Manchester's football urchins merit their place in the game's highest echelon - even if Old Trafford is hardly quaking at the prospect. The rich aroma of promotion had enticed another 32,000-plus crowd into a ground simmering with feverish expectancy and within seconds of the final whistle it seemed as though most of them were dancing a Status Quo knees-up on the pitch. </p> <p>Royle could not disguise his feelings as he supped a celebratory can of cider. \"And then there were two,\" he beamed. \"It's taken Barnsley out of the equation and now we have to hope Lady Luck decides we have suffered enough. </p> <p>\"The fans have been waiting a long time for a night like this. They have been suffering more than the team. All those people who followed us to the outposts of the Second Division deserve Premiership football and we've got one foot in the door.\" </p> <p>Birmingham City, of course, harbour their own Premiership aspirations and Trevor Francis's side were intent on gate-crashing the party in their pursuit of a play-off berth. </p> <p>For long spells industry outstripped ingenuity but that mattered little to the delirious hordes when Taylor sent the decibel levels spinning five minutes before half-time. Kevin Horlock clipped a free-kick into the penalty area and when Richard Jobson diverted the ball into Taylor's path the striker - an \"alehouse player\", according to the man from Radio Five - lashed a low shot beyond Thomas Myrhe. Some pub team. </p> <p>Taylor could have prevented much gnawing of fingernails when he broke clear only to shoot straight at Myrhe.

      "bodyText": "Presumably the 17,000 hardy souls who have already parted with \u00a33m to renew their Manchester City season tickets, regardless of which division their ragtag heroes will be occupying, have scrutinised the small print for the possible health implications. The club's endearing propensity for heroic failure has been dubbed Cityitis by Joe Royle and even though the genial manager has concocted something of an antidote in the past 18 months a nauseating tension suffocated Moss Side last night before the ultimate and overwhelming sense of euphoria. A priceless goal from Robert Taylor ensured that Manchester reverberated to lung-bursting strains of Blue Moon. Unless Ipswich win at Charlton this afternoon the 30th anniversary of City's European Cup Winners' Cup triumph will be spent toasting a new league and a new era. Otherwise, as regular City-watchers will know, those of a nervous disposition would be advised to switch off now. For should Royle's charges be required to glean some sort of return at Blackburn next weekend the suspicion lingers that a team famed for aiming a 12-bore at their own toecaps could surpass themselves once again. On this evidence, however, Manchester's football urchins merit their place in the game's highest echelon - even if Old Trafford is hardly quaking at the prospect. The rich aroma of promotion had enticed another 32,000-plus crowd into a ground simmering with feverish expectancy and within seconds of the final whistle it seemed as though most of them were dancing a Status Quo knees-up on the pitch. Royle could not disguise his feelings as he supped a celebratory can of cider. \"And then there were two,\" he beamed. \"It's taken Barnsley out of the equation and now we have to hope Lady Luck decides we have suffered enough. \"The fans have been waiting a long time for a night like this. They have been suffering more than the team. All those people who followed us to the outposts of the Second Division deserve Premiership football and we've got one foot in the door.\" Birmingham City, of course, harbour their own Premiership aspirations and Trevor Francis's side were intent on gate-crashing the party in their pursuit of a play-off berth. For long spells industry outstripped ingenuity but that mattered little to the delirious hordes when Taylor sent the decibel levels spinning five minutes before half-time. Kevin Horlock clipped a free-kick into the penalty area and when Richard Jobson diverted the ball into Taylor's path the striker - an \"alehouse player\", according to the man from Radio Five - lashed a low shot beyond Thomas Myrhe. Some pub team. Taylor could have prevented much gnawing of fingernails when he broke clear only to shoot straight at Myrhe. But by then Birmingham were playing a bit-part role, their disappointment compounded by Jon McCarthy's injury, which they fear may be his second broken leg of the season. Taylor's fifth goal in laser blue had earned him instant cult-hero status and, after four queasy minutes of stoppage- time, everyone associated with City was in Utopia. Premiership Champions League Chelsea cannot qualify for the Champions League if they lose at home to Liverpool and Arsenal win at Everton. First Division Promotion Should Ipwich not win at Charlton today, Manchester City will go up. Play-offs Wolves will be out of contention if they draw with Fulham and Huddersfield win, or if they lose and Huddersfield get a point. Bolton must avoid defeat at Crewe to stand any chance of reaching the play-offs. Relegation Walsall will go down if they fail to beat Portsmouth and West Brom win at QPR. Crewe will stay up if they win, as will Crystal Palace if they beat Blackburn. Second Division Relegation Blackpool will go down if (a) they lose at Oldham and Oxford do not lose at home to Scunthorpe, (b) they draw and Oxford win, or (c) they lose and Cardiff win. Scunthorpe will be relegated if (a) they lose or (b) they draw and Cardiff win. Third Division Promotion Swansea will be promoted if (a) they draw with Exeter or (b) two of Northampton, Darlington and Peterborough do not win. Relegation Shrewsbury go down if they lose to Brighton and Chester and Carlisle beat Cheltenham and Darlington respectively. Conference Promotion Kidderminster will be promoted if (a) they draw at Woking, or (b) Rushden fail to beat Scarborough.",

Bailey's 118, his 45th first-class century, took seven hours and 13 minutes, though he was ably supported by Karl Krikken, who scored 51, and Paul Aldred. \u0095 Gloucestershire had the best of another rain-affected day's play at Bristol, largely thanks to Mike Smith. The left-arm seamer took three wickets for 13 from 10 overs, dismissing both Sussex openers and their captain, Chris Adams. In-form Michael Bevan, though, scored 46 before nicking the ball to Jack Russell. After a full morning session, only five overs were bowled in the afternoon, leaving any positive result unlikely with Sussex 110 for five going into the final day. \u0095 There was no play yesterday in Zimbabwe's match against Hampshire in Southampton, leaving the tourists desperately short of match practice three weeks before the first test at Lord's. \"The longer we have with rain, the less chance we have for our batsmen to get used to these conditions. We need as much practice as we can get,\" said their manager, Dan Stannard.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was late on Thursday night when Ajay Sharma found out that he had been caught in the malign web of intrigue and rumour that extends to every corner of international cricket. His wife rang him from India to say that he had been accused by the Indian police of being involved in match-fixing and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. </p> <p>They said that they thought he was in England, that he had fled there shortly after the Hansie Cronje tapes had been made public. They said that the police suspected he had made a small fortune by acting as the link between corrupt cricketers and bookmakers. They did not know when they would find him. </p> <p>If they are still interested, they should make sure they drop by the pavilion at the Arbories Memorial Ground in Padiham this afternoon. Weather permitting, they should see the former Indian test player trotting out at No3 to make his debut in a grudge match against Ribblesdale Wanderers in the Ribblesdale cricket league. </p> <p>At the best of times it is an epic encounter; Padiham are the current champions, Wanderers last year's runners-up. But in turning out for the home team today, Sharma has inadvertently plunged the genteel, somewhat eccentric world of minor Lancashire league cricket into the centre of the multimillion-pound scandal currently engulfing the international game. </p> <p>\"I won't really know what to say,\" said the home team's captain Andrew McNicholas. \"The whole thing has been a bit of a shock. It's quite amazing really. It's not really what you expect in our league. There's not much to be gained from match-fixing in the Ribblesdale League. I'm still quite amazed by some of the allegations.\" </p> <p>When he is not playing cricket, McNicholas is employed by Lancashire police as a constable. At least if the warrant comes through he will be handily placed to execute the arrest. </p> <p>The Indian police claim they have proof of Sharma's dealings and of telephone calls made to players and bookmakers during South Africa's recent tour of India, when match-rigging allegations first surfaced. According to one estimate, Padiham's star player made about 500 calls to bookmakers and players during the series and called one leading Indian cricketer prior to every match in March. </p> <p>As the Indian press berated him and the Indian police searched for him, accusing him of being at the centre of an illegal multimillion-pound empire, Sharma was sitting comfortably, watching television in an unremarkable terrace house adjoining a corner shop on the outskirts of Burnley. </p> <p>The house and shop belong to his friend and team-mate Pankaj Tripathi, who runs the business when not playing for Padiham and was responsible for bringing Sharma to Lancashire after befriending him in 1991. The team are currently going for a record third consecutive title and Tripathi is hoping Sharma's expertise can bring them that elusive piece of silverware. </p> <p><strong> Nothing to hide</strong><br> </p> <p> \"I only had an average of 35 last season,\" says the shopkeeper-cum-Padiham opening batsman and former captain in a crisp Lancashire accent, ignoring match-fixing questions. \"But I did break my toe. </p> <p>\"It's my last season playing cricket and what a way to end it. Who'd have thought that Padiham would become involved in a match-fixing scandal? The phone has not stopped ringing since Ajay's name first appeared in the Indian press. I'm sick of it. We've got a very important season ahead, you know. The whole thing's just rubbish. It's one big joke.\" </p> <p>Joking aside, Sharma insists that his humble surroundings and the fact that he is plying his trade in what is effectively village cricket speaks volumes for his innocence. \"I have nothing to hide. I am in England to play cricket and did not leave India because of the police. This is complete nonsense. </p> <p>\"I don't know any bookmakers but I do know lots of Indian cricketers and this is why I have been named in this scandal. Mohammad Azharuddin has been my friend since 1997. There's no crime in talking to your friend. I always call him before matches to wish him good luck. Whenever he's in Delhi I go and meet him. I know his family very well. </p> <p>\"Everybody is at it in India; everybody is naming anybody they can think of as a match-fixer. I am quite happy to let the Indian police see my bank account. I do not have any foreign cars and own only one flat. If I really had millions in the bank, do you think I would be here in Burnley? I am here to play for Padiham and we've got a very important match. That's the main thing that I am thinking about. I am here to help this club.\" </p> <p>It is Sharma's reputation on the field which persuaded the Padiham cricket committee to offer him a contract until September 9. A former captain of Delhi, he owns the third highest first-class batting average of all time at 68.5 and, according to Tripathi, \"turns the ball better than Shane Warne\". </p> <p>If the cricket-obsessed folk of Padiham seem oblivious to the alleged international match-fixer in their ranks then the presence of Shahid Nawaz, Ribblesdale Wanderers' overseas player, might have something to do with it. The Pakistani batsman holds the league record after scoring 1,608 runs last season and Sharma is set to test his skill against the opposition's main weapon. The local press has billed it as a clash of the Asian titans and local cricket enthusiasts are rubbing their hands in anticipation of a crunching duel. </p> <p><strong> Seeing the funny side</strong><br> </p> <p> Moments after Sharma had got off the phone to his wife his next job was to call the other important woman in his life, the Padiham honorary secretary Ann Hall. </p> <p>\"I've met Ajay,\" Hall said yesterday. \"He seems like a nice gentleman and we are all looking forward to watching him play. A lot of the players don't know what's going on so we are going to tell them before today's match. I'm sure they'll all have a good joke about it.\" </p> <p>She has had a stoic approach to the whole affair throughout. There are, after all, more important things at stake than the reputation of international cricket, in Padiham at least. \"We are going for a third consecutive title,\" she said, anticipating today's first taste of cricket action. \"Match-fixing is not what you really expect at our level of cricket. It might go in other countries but it doesn't happen in Lancashire; not in Padiham, anyhow.\"</p>",

As the Indian press berated him and the Indian police searched for him, accusing him of being at the centre of an illegal multimillion-pound empire, Sharma was sitting comfortably, watching television in an unremarkable terrace house adjoining a corner shop on the outskirts of Burnley. The house and shop belong to his friend and team-mate Pankaj Tripathi, who runs the business when not playing for Padiham and was responsible for bringing Sharma to Lancashire after befriending him in 1991. The team are currently going for a record third consecutive title and Tripathi is hoping Sharma's expertise can bring them that elusive piece of silverware. Nothing to hide \"I only had an average of 35 last season,\" says the shopkeeper-cum-Padiham opening batsman and former captain in a crisp Lancashire accent, ignoring match-fixing questions. \"But I did break my toe. \"It's my last season playing cricket and what a way to end it. Who'd have thought that Padiham would become involved in a match-fixing scandal? The phone has not stopped ringing since Ajay's name first appeared in the Indian press. I'm sick of it. We've got a very important season ahead, you know. The whole thing's just rubbish. It's one big joke.\" Joking aside, Sharma insists that his humble surroundings and the fact that he is plying his trade in what is effectively village cricket speaks volumes for his innocence. \"I have nothing to hide. I am in England to play cricket and did not leave India because of the police. This is complete nonsense. \"I don't know any bookmakers but I do know lots of Indian cricketers and this is why I have been named in this scandal. Mohammad Azharuddin has been my friend since 1997. There's no crime in talking to your friend. I always call him before matches to wish him good luck. Whenever he's in Delhi I go and meet him. I know his family very well. \"Everybody is at it in India; everybody is naming anybody they can think of as a match-fixer. I am quite happy to let the Indian police see my bank account. I do not have any foreign cars and own only one flat. If I really had millions in the bank, do you think I would be here in Burnley? I am here to play for Padiham and we've got a very important match. That's the main thing that I am thinking about. I am here to help this club.\" It is Sharma's reputation on the field which persuaded the Padiham cricket committee to offer him a contract until September 9. A former captain of Delhi, he owns the third highest first-class batting average of all time at 68.5 and, according to Tripathi, \"turns the ball better than Shane Warne\". If the cricket-obsessed folk of Padiham seem oblivious to the alleged international match-fixer in their ranks then the presence of Shahid Nawaz, Ribblesdale Wanderers' overseas player, might have something to do with it. The Pakistani batsman holds the league record after scoring 1,608 runs last season and Sharma is set to test his skill against the opposition's main weapon. The local press has billed it as a clash of the Asian titans and local cricket enthusiasts are rubbing their hands in anticipation of a crunching duel. Seeing the funny side Moments after Sharma had got off the phone to his wife his next job was to call the other important woman in his life, the Padiham honorary secretary Ann Hall. \"I've met Ajay,\" Hall said yesterday. \"He seems like a nice gentleman and we are all looking forward to watching him play. A lot of the players don't know what's going on so we are going to tell them before today's match. I'm sure they'll all have a good joke about it.\" She has had a stoic approach to the whole affair throughout. There are, after all, more important things at stake than the reputation of international cricket, in Padiham at least. \"We are going for a third consecutive title,\" she said, anticipating today's first taste of cricket action. \"Match-fixing is not what you really expect at our level of cricket. It might go in other countries but it doesn't happen in Lancashire; not in Padiham, anyhow.\"",

Despite what the BBC news suggested on Thursday night, the collapse of the biggest transfer deal in British football history is nothing to do with the deteriorating relationship between Martin Edwards and Sir Alex Ferguson. Neither is it, as has been speculated, merely another Ferguson psychological ruse, an attempt to gee up his existing strike force. In fact, like so much of modern football, it is entirely down to money. </p> <p>When a public limited company with a stock market listing of over \u00a31bn makes an investment as big as \u00a318.5m, it is obliged by its shareholders to employ all due diligence. In other words, at that price it can't afford any risk. So some sort of insurance policy is required: after all, if the player breaks down and doesn't play, \u00a342,000 a week in unproductive wages is a burden few profit margins can lightly meet. Insurers, however, are rarely keen on paying out, so need to satisfy themselves that all is in order before underwriting any policy. </p> <p>Thus we have seen an arms-race escalation in the medical examinations that big-money signings are obliged to undertake. When Spurs sought to buy John Hartson for \u00a37m from Wimbledon recently, the club insurers insisted not merely on some quick once-over but on specific tests centring on his heart, blood, knees, ankles and back, a session of scanning and sample-giving which lasted more than three hours. Even though it did not include close perusal of his scalp, Hartson didn't make it. </p> <p>Van Nistelrooy, with a recent history of medial ligament damage, had to run an even more rigorous medical assault course. And when doubts surfaced from it, United's insurers refused to issue a policy unless the club agreed to a clause ruling out seeking compensation for any injury resulting from his weakened knee. Which would have been as sensible as a motorist living in Liverpool agreeing to a clause in his car insurance ruling out seeking compensation if it was stolen. In short, when he broke down in training back home in Eindhoven yesterday, back in Manchester trebles would have been ordered all round. </p> <p>How things have changed. In 1973, Lou Macari became United's then-record signing for \u00a3200,000. \"To be honest, looking back I don't recall ever having a medical,\" he says. \"I was signed on the Thursday, went down to Manchester overnight, trained on the Friday and was in the team Saturday.

And then there was the double stop he made to thwart Tony Dinning's penalty for Stockport three days before the start of the year that was voted \"save of the century\" by supporters. </p> <p>His father, who passed away in 1995, four months after Richard's debut, would have been proud of his son's achievements and progress to challenge David Seaman and Nigel Martyn for the England jersey. It was Colin Wright's redundancy that first turned Richard towards football. Before then his passion had been grass-track racing and the Ipswich Witches speedway team. With money tight football was the cheaper option. His older brother Stuart gave him the next shove forward, forcing Richard to take his place between the posts while he opted for the glamour of the outfield. </p> <p>\"I didn't realise at the time that Stuart was doing me a favour.

      "bodyText": "Ruud van Nistelrooy's anguish at missing out on a move to Manchester United was followed by even more trauma yesterday when the Dutch striker suffered a fresh injury which is likely to put him out of the game for a year. Any prospects of United resurrecting their \u00a318.5m deal for him imploded when his suspect right knee gave way at PSV Eindhoven's De Herdgang training ground. European football's most sought-after striker underwent exploratory keyhole surgery at St Anna hospital in nearby Geldrop and the immediate diagnosis was that he would be out for up to a year with a ruptured cruciate ligament. Television pictures showed Van Nistelrooy writhing in agony after collapsing during heading practice with his personal fitness trainer Luc van Agt. At one stage he appeared close to tears, pulling his shirt over his head and covering his face with his hands. The PSV doctor Kees Rein van der Hoogenband carried out the operation. \"It's a very unhappy and unlucky situation,\" said the PSV spokesman Pedro Salazar Hewitt. \"It could have happened to any player but that is the way these things go. \"In the next few weeks a decision will be made about when an operation will take place. After that, Ruud will have to wait a minimum of eight months before he is fit again. He is out for the rest of the year and it could be a full year before he is back but he is a strong player and hopefully he will come back as good as ever.\" As he lay in a hospital bed last night, Van Nistelrooy will also have been digesting the numbing news that his only involvement in Euro 2000 will be as a spectator. \"He was doing some exercises for almost an hour,\" added Salazar Hewitt. \"He did the same exercise 25 times, and on the 26th it went wrong.\" Van Nistelrooy said: \"When I fell on my knee it was very painful for about two minutes. \"The pain lessened and I was able to walk off the pitch myself and in the dressing room we decided to go to hospital.\" Although Sir Alex Ferguson insisted he was still \"monitoring the situation\", there is no chance whatsoever of the deal being resurrected now. \"It's a terrible blow for the lad,\" said the United manager. \"What started as a bright week for him has turned into a nightmare.\" With a bitter irony, the latest and cruellest twist to the Van Nistelrooy saga comes less than 24 hours after his proposed British transfer record move to Old Trafford collapsed because he would not have an exploratory operation on the same knee. He damaged a medial ligament in the same knee in a friendly against Silkeborg of Denmark seven weeks ago and United reluctantly pulled out of the deal when he failed a routine medical on Tuesday. They wanted to reassess the injury but Dutch football's leading scorer refused because of the possible implications for his rehabilitation programme before this summer's European Championship in the Netherlands and Belgium in which he had been expected to lead the Dutch attack. Although PSV hastily released a statement claiming the two injuries were not related, United will feel their decision has been vindicated. \"It's a very unhappy and a very unlucky situation because it happened just 48 hours after he was with Manchester,\" said Salazar Hewitt. \"But it could have happened if he was a totally fit player and that's how these things go.\" \"He's a young man and a strong guy and we'll wait and see what happens when he comes back in a year's time.\"",

They did it, everybody said, for Joe, but the gesture was a brief one. Nine of the last 11 fixtures have been lost and the other two drawn. </p> <p>Olsen has been unable to arrest the slump, not helped by the departure of Wimbledon's best defender Chris Perry to Tottenham for \u00a32.4m before the season began. </p> <p>The situation has not been improved, either, by financial matters which persuaded the club's Norwegian owners, Kjel Inge Rokke and Bjorn Rune Gjeltsen, to send in a troubleshooter, Svein Bakke, to inspect the books shortly before Christmas. </p> <p>At the time Sam Hammam, who sold a controlling interest in the club to Rokke and Gjeltsen in the summer of 1997, made a gloomy but now increasingly accurate prediction of the effect of the three-day investigation on the players. </p> <p>\"It will demoralise the team and we could hit a downward spiral,\" Hammam said. \"If we ever go to the First Division we will lose between \u00a37m and \u00a311m a year. In two years the club will have no players, no money and would probably be in the Second or Third Division, heading nowhere.\" </p> <p>The results of Bakke's labours can only be guessed at but it does seem clear that should Wimbledon be relegated the players the owners already want to offload would be joined by several more who, like Cort, want to stay in the Premiership. </p> <p>The likelihood of Wimbledon ever regaining Premiership status would be remote. They might, as Hammam has warned, drop through the divisions like stones down a well. </p> <p>But why the fuss about Wimbledon? After all, clubs have abseiled before now. Carlisle, Northampton, Brighton, Leyton Orient, Swansea: they had all found room at the top once upon a time. </p> <p>The point about Wimbledon is that, and especially since the formation of the Premier League, they have represented the last of the corner shops in a game which increasingly benefits supermarketeers and their shareholders. </p> <p>Maybe Wimbledon's course was run once they became the property of distant Norwegian trawler billionaires who were never going to allow the ship to be skippered in the manner of Captain Pugwash. </p> <p>Then again, vikings always wanted to die with their swords in their hands. At least Wimbledon could show some fight tomorrow before their longships are put to the torch.</p>",

Olsen has been unable to arrest the slump, not helped by the departure of Wimbledon's best defender Chris Perry to Tottenham for \u00a32.4m before the season began. The situation has not been improved, either, by financial matters which persuaded the club's Norwegian owners, Kjel Inge Rokke and Bjorn Rune Gjeltsen, to send in a troubleshooter, Svein Bakke, to inspect the books shortly before Christmas. At the time Sam Hammam, who sold a controlling interest in the club to Rokke and Gjeltsen in the summer of 1997, made a gloomy but now increasingly accurate prediction of the effect of the three-day investigation on the players. \"It will demoralise the team and we could hit a downward spiral,\" Hammam said. \"If we ever go to the First Division we will lose between \u00a37m and \u00a311m a year. In two years the club will have no players, no money and would probably be in the Second or Third Division, heading nowhere.\" The results of Bakke's labours can only be guessed at but it does seem clear that should Wimbledon be relegated the players the owners already want to offload would be joined by several more who, like Cort, want to stay in the Premiership. The likelihood of Wimbledon ever regaining Premiership status would be remote. They might, as Hammam has warned, drop through the divisions like stones down a well. But why the fuss about Wimbledon? After all, clubs have abseiled before now. Carlisle, Northampton, Brighton, Leyton Orient, Swansea: they had all found room at the top once upon a time. The point about Wimbledon is that, and especially since the formation of the Premier League, they have represented the last of the corner shops in a game which increasingly benefits supermarketeers and their shareholders. Maybe Wimbledon's course was run once they became the property of distant Norwegian trawler billionaires who were never going to allow the ship to be skippered in the manner of Captain Pugwash. Then again, vikings always wanted to die with their swords in their hands. At least Wimbledon could show some fight tomorrow before their longships are put to the torch.",

      "body": "<p>'In London,\" said Michel No\u00eb before we set off on our cycling excursion around central Paris, \"you have to be too much, you know, the Mad Max. The attitude, the clothes, all of this. You have to be a little bit crazy. In Paris, it is different. Here we have not the helmets, the Lycra. It's much more relaxed.\" </p> <p>And it's true. I pulled on my black helmet, slipped on my black waterproofs, appliqu\u00e9d all this with fluorescent strips and sashes. Then, the pi\u00e8ce de resistance. I gave Michel the look that I employ to withering effect as I cycle to work in London, one which says: \"I have drunk several espressos and, by the look of my wild eyes and barmy demeanour, you may conclude that I have eaten a handful of amphetamines.\" </p> <p>I appeared, no doubt, completely bonkers and, yet, to my mind, quite voguish in a proto-Hitler Youth kind of way. For his part, Michel looked worried: \"Now you are him! The Mad Max! This is how you roll in London. I see it now!\" </p> <p>By contrast, everybody else on this tour was dressed as though they were going to appear in Five Go Cycling in Dorset. Some wouldn't have looked out of place in pleated skirts and straw baskets filled with fresh produce. And that was just the men. Not that the women were any more butch. They looked as though they wouldn't be up for giving a bus driver the finger or a choice piece of Anglo-Saxon if they were involved in an altercation at Highbury Corner. I was the only one in a helmet. Amateurs, the lot of them! </p> <p>Michel runs a cycle shop near the Place de la Bastille. It's called Paris \u00e0 V\u00e9lo: C'est Sympa!, and is devoted to promoting the apparently insane notion that cycling in a city not noted for its laid-back, courteous motorists, can in fact be a pleasant option. Thanks to the far-sighted, clean-air policies of recent Parisian mayors, including the present incumbent Jean Tiberi, there are many cycle lanes, chief among which are two grands axes running through the city (one going north-south from La Villette to the Htel de Ville and on towards Montparnasse, the other an east-west axis from the Bois de Boulogne to the Bois de Vincennes). Cyclists can also use widened bus lanes. </p> <p>When Ken Livingstone becomes mayor of London, he should go on a two-wheeled tour of Paris with M Tiberi, and apply the lessons learned there to his traffic-choked, mostly cycle-unfriendly metropolis. </p> <p>In Paris, as in Britain, there are former railways that have become green corridors for cycling citizens. True, most of the vast boulevards opened up by Baron Haussmann are not tremendously pleasant for cycling, and those vast showpiece intersections of choreographed traffic, such as the Place de la Concorde, are only to be approached by cyclists with higher degrees in urban traffic management and nerves of steel. </p> <p>No\u00eb and his team of cycling guides have been trying to introduce tourists to a different, almost secret city of quiet back streets from the one that visitors might experience on tour buses. It's not quite the series of villages that the company's website suggests, but it does make Paris seem like a relaxed, peaceful place, which is a great achievement. However, true Parisians probably don't care for our tour leader Christianne and her multi-lingual charges choking up their otherwise tourist-free zones. At one point, we sat in a quiet courtyard called le village St Paul, which, following corporate policy, Christianne was keen to tout as an example of village Paris. I felt like an interloper in an otherwise secret, silent domain. </p> <p>For our three-hour tour, called the Heart of Paris, the most touristy of the tours on offer, Christianne rode at the front of our happy band of sit-up-and-beg Peugeots with a leader's flag stuck on a large staff in her pannier rack. She conducted the tour in French, English and German, which was very impressive for all 10 of us, even for the three flying Dutchmen and the sluggish Swedish woman. Christianne took us gamely the wrong way up one-way streets and past open-jawed, truncheon-toting security guards at the Louvre. I liked her style. </p> <p>At the back of our group rode the appealingly taciturn Philippe, who had a little flag all of his own, and whose job it was to make sure stragglers didn't get lured into the sick world of poncy chocolatiers and recherch\u00e9 bistros. With Christianne at the front and Philippe at the back, it was like being at primary school again, which in a way was very reassuring, especially for the Swedish woman, who was no Eddie Merckx. That said, Philippe didn't join us for our mid-cycle coffee, though we didn't take the rejection personally. </p> <p>After we negotiated the busy Rue Saint Antoine, we plunged into the Marais, soon stopping at the lovely Place des Vosges for a briefing. This square consists of 36 symmetrical houses (one of which Victor Hugo and his friend Les Miserables lived in) with a ground-floor arcade. </p> <p>At this point, Christianne championed the conservation achievements of Andr\u00e9 Malraux, cultured culture minister in the 60s. If it had not been for him, she claimed, much of the Marais, with its ancient squares and medieval buildings, would have been bulldozed in favour of skyscrapers. </p> <p>\"Forty years ago, this neighbourhood was in complete disarray,\" Christianne told us in a series of major north European tongues. \"The thinking was to redevelop, to destroy, but Malraux said, no.\" The result was that some of the most ancient and royal buildings in Paris have been restored, waves of artists and otherwise trendy people have moved in, and now the area provides a pleasing small-scale counterpoint to some of the more bombastic architectural hoopla of the 1e and the 8e arrondissements to the west. \"This has become emblematic of provincial France,\" said Christianne gnomically before explaining. \"Every little French city now has a central restoration project like the one that Malraux unleashed.\" </p> <p>About my bicycling person, I carried a Palm Pilot, one of those new-fangled portable screens which, such is the nature of technological progress, we will be carrying to supply our newspaper and other reading needs in a few years, no doubt. I had down-loaded into this device the Lonely Planet's guide to Paris from the Internet in order to find out how well it compared with their quirky books or indeed Christianne's commentary. Frankly, it didn't. At the Place des Vosges, for instance, the information supplied by the Lonely Planet download is schematic and has not a hint of personality. This is a shame, surely, because part of the appeal of such guide books as the Lonely Planet series is to carry around a witty cognoscento to foreign climes, some insightful smart-arse to be downloaded from one's bag at the relevant moment.

      "bodyText": "'In London,\" said Michel No\u00eb before we set off on our cycling excursion around central Paris, \"you have to be too much, you know, the Mad Max. The attitude, the clothes, all of this. You have to be a little bit crazy. In Paris, it is different. Here we have not the helmets, the Lycra. It's much more relaxed.\" And it's true. I pulled on my black helmet, slipped on my black waterproofs, appliqu\u00e9d all this with fluorescent strips and sashes. Then, the pi\u00e8ce de resistance. I gave Michel the look that I employ to withering effect as I cycle to work in London, one which says: \"I have drunk several espressos and, by the look of my wild eyes and barmy demeanour, you may conclude that I have eaten a handful of amphetamines.\" I appeared, no doubt, completely bonkers and, yet, to my mind, quite voguish in a proto-Hitler Youth kind of way. For his part, Michel looked worried: \"Now you are him! The Mad Max! This is how you roll in London. I see it now!\" By contrast, everybody else on this tour was dressed as though they were going to appear in Five Go Cycling in Dorset. Some wouldn't have looked out of place in pleated skirts and straw baskets filled with fresh produce. And that was just the men. Not that the women were any more butch. They looked as though they wouldn't be up for giving a bus driver the finger or a choice piece of Anglo-Saxon if they were involved in an altercation at Highbury Corner. I was the only one in a helmet. Amateurs, the lot of them! Michel runs a cycle shop near the Place de la Bastille. It's called Paris \u00e0 V\u00e9lo: C'est Sympa!, and is devoted to promoting the apparently insane notion that cycling in a city not noted for its laid-back, courteous motorists, can in fact be a pleasant option. Thanks to the far-sighted, clean-air policies of recent Parisian mayors, including the present incumbent Jean Tiberi, there are many cycle lanes, chief among which are two grands axes running through the city (one going north-south from La Villette to the Htel de Ville and on towards Montparnasse, the other an east-west axis from the Bois de Boulogne to the Bois de Vincennes). Cyclists can also use widened bus lanes. When Ken Livingstone becomes mayor of London, he should go on a two-wheeled tour of Paris with M Tiberi, and apply the lessons learned there to his traffic-choked, mostly cycle-unfriendly metropolis. In Paris, as in Britain, there are former railways that have become green corridors for cycling citizens. True, most of the vast boulevards opened up by Baron Haussmann are not tremendously pleasant for cycling, and those vast showpiece intersections of choreographed traffic, such as the Place de la Concorde, are only to be approached by cyclists with higher degrees in urban traffic management and nerves of steel. No\u00eb and his team of cycling guides have been trying to introduce tourists to a different, almost secret city of quiet back streets from the one that visitors might experience on tour buses. It's not quite the series of villages that the company's website suggests, but it does make Paris seem like a relaxed, peaceful place, which is a great achievement. However, true Parisians probably don't care for our tour leader Christianne and her multi-lingual charges choking up their otherwise tourist-free zones. At one point, we sat in a quiet courtyard called le village St Paul, which, following corporate policy, Christianne was keen to tout as an example of village Paris. I felt like an interloper in an otherwise secret, silent domain. For our three-hour tour, called the Heart of Paris, the most touristy of the tours on offer, Christianne rode at the front of our happy band of sit-up-and-beg Peugeots with a leader's flag stuck on a large staff in her pannier rack. She conducted the tour in French, English and German, which was very impressive for all 10 of us, even for the three flying Dutchmen and the sluggish Swedish woman. Christianne took us gamely the wrong way up one-way streets and past open-jawed, truncheon-toting security guards at the Louvre. I liked her style. At the back of our group rode the appealingly taciturn Philippe, who had a little flag all of his own, and whose job it was to make sure stragglers didn't get lured into the sick world of poncy chocolatiers and recherch\u00e9 bistros. With Christianne at the front and Philippe at the back, it was like being at primary school again, which in a way was very reassuring, especially for the Swedish woman, who was no Eddie Merckx. That said, Philippe didn't join us for our mid-cycle coffee, though we didn't take the rejection personally. After we negotiated the busy Rue Saint Antoine, we plunged into the Marais, soon stopping at the lovely Place des Vosges for a briefing. This square consists of 36 symmetrical houses (one of which Victor Hugo and his friend Les Miserables lived in) with a ground-floor arcade. At this point, Christianne championed the conservation achievements of Andr\u00e9 Malraux, cultured culture minister in the 60s. If it had not been for him, she claimed, much of the Marais, with its ancient squares and medieval buildings, would have been bulldozed in favour of skyscrapers. \"Forty years ago, this neighbourhood was in complete disarray,\" Christianne told us in a series of major north European tongues. \"The thinking was to redevelop, to destroy, but Malraux said, no.\" The result was that some of the most ancient and royal buildings in Paris have been restored, waves of artists and otherwise trendy people have moved in, and now the area provides a pleasing small-scale counterpoint to some of the more bombastic architectural hoopla of the 1e and the 8e arrondissements to the west. \"This has become emblematic of provincial France,\" said Christianne gnomically before explaining. \"Every little French city now has a central restoration project like the one that Malraux unleashed.\" About my bicycling person, I carried a Palm Pilot, one of those new-fangled portable screens which, such is the nature of technological progress, we will be carrying to supply our newspaper and other reading needs in a few years, no doubt. I had down-loaded into this device the Lonely Planet's guide to Paris from the Internet in order to find out how well it compared with their quirky books or indeed Christianne's commentary. Frankly, it didn't. At the Place des Vosges, for instance, the information supplied by the Lonely Planet download is schematic and has not a hint of personality. This is a shame, surely, because part of the appeal of such guide books as the Lonely Planet series is to carry around a witty cognoscento to foreign climes, some insightful smart-arse to be downloaded from one's bag at the relevant moment. But at present, this electronic guide offers just the facts, which are necessary but by no means sufficient. At the moment, too, the Palm Pilot map pages are unusably terrible. The Palm Pilot techno johnnies will clearly have to finesse this thing before it becomes, as I'm sure it will be, de rigueur for people who find mobile phones two years past being even pass\u00e9. For instance, cyclists will need a bracket to hold the Palm Pilot on the handlebars so they can glance at the thing as they pedal along. What's more, for road safety reasons among others, the Palm Pilot will ultimately need to be voice activated. At the moment, you see, you have to use a pointer that resembles an eyebrow pencil in order to negotiate the various screens, but this, I found, is extremely dangerous while simultaneously riding a bicycle in central Paris.

And the fact is that it's never caused him a moment's hassle. </p> <p>He drinks his beer, and I drink my brandy, and both of us stare stupidly at the vast brown barrels full of home-brewed liquor that are piled up in the shadows of the taverna. Outside on the pavement, there's a stray cat stretched out in the sun, nosing at that sweet smell of old drains that you always get in a country that's not yet succumbed to the air-conditioned nightmare. </p> <p>The lost American says the truth is that his home here is illegal, too. He has this room, it's not far from the Acropolis, and, for his money, it's in the finest house in all of Athens, but the house was built with out a permit 140 years ago. And, in all those years, there's never been a moment's hassle about that either. </p> <p>So, what does that mean? That the Greeks don't respect the law? Hell, no - they invented the law. Of course, they respect the law. But they also respect people. That's what makes them different. Like Mr Walk-up-and-down, with the bushy grey beard and the coat of many odours, who stomps his way up and down Kidathineon Street, muttering under his breath. He gets food and water from the shopkeepers. They just give it to him, because he is a clown of God. Same with the alcoholics, they get treated well. And the stray cats. And the refugees. </p> <p>There are 500,000 refugees in Greece - the whole population is only 10 million - and you don't see many of them begging because they get jobs and houses too. The lost American says the Greeks understand about refugees, because they've all got cousins in the United States and Australia. Sure, the Albanians get blamed for all the crime, and rightly so. The Albanians are mountain people and they're just as tough as they have to be. He says the Greeks understand that. He says he himself may be dirty, he may be gay, he may be lost, but the Greeks will respect him for the man he is. </p> <p>Maybe he's right, this dusty guy in his dark corner. Or maybe he's just romanticising the place, trying to justify his oblivion. Out on the streets, the evidence is against him. There's Omonia Square with the kiosks selling porn and the jam of drivers pumping their horns; Syntagma Square with the litter on the pavement and the junk music on loud speakers and the junk food from the imperialist McDonald's and the same drivers squirting oily black fumes over everything. And then there's the Acropolis. </p> <p>There must be few places in the known universe that can be visited by time-travellers from 2,000 years in the past and still be recognisable. The collection of temples and theatres on the Acropolis of Athens is one of them. At least, it is from a distance. </p> <p>Before 8am each day, the coaches start to pile into the car park on the southern edge of the theatre of Dionysius. By 8am an avalanche starts to move up hill, hundreds of heaving, sweating, panting visitors: the Americans with buttocks like boulders, grunting like rutting rhino as they lumber upwards; the flocks of Japanese, so delicate by comparison; the French schoolchildren who should win Olympic gold medals for screaming; the dour Brits with their sensible shoes. By 8.30am, they have covered the place like headlice. There is no peace. There is no place to stand. And yet, there is magic here. </p> <p>The best of it arguably is in the ancient Agora, which is bypassed by most of the tour groups and where real life signals from the past: in the 2,000-year-old remnants of Simon the cobbler, who lived on the edge of this old market and who left behind the hobnails and eyelets of his trade along with his favourite goblet, with his name still scratched into its base; in the 13 pot thimbles that were found in the remains of the state prison and that, the archaeologists believe, carried the hemlock with which the condemned kissed goodbye to their lives. </p> <p>Even on the peak of the Acropolis, where the tide of tourists is as thick as lava and no sweeter to smell, you can still catch the sheer love of life that inspired these buildings. Look, in the museum there, at the statue of the youth with the calf around his shoulders, its hooves gathered on his chest, and see the peace and the pleasure in him; or the young women with their braided red hair; or Artemis leaning gently against the thigh of her brother, Apollo, while he chats to her, as gods must do when they feel at peace with the world. </p> <p>It is the same in the streets. Behind the curtain of noise and smog, Athens remains a collection of villages. Just turn off any main street and follow any twisting alley, and you will find yourself among small houses with dopey dogs and grapevines on the walls - and tavernas. </p> <p>The tavernas are the home of real Athenians, places of pleasure, and specifically of two particular pleasures for which the Greeks have found words: parea , a deep affection for friends often exhibited over vast quantities of food; and kefi , which might be misunderstood to mean drunkenness but which really describes the abandonment of self, possibly with the help of alcohol. </p> <p>These are warm and often rowdy places, with every class and kind of Greek thrown in together. They stay open for ever: for those who start work with the sun, they serve lunch from the middle of the morning; for those who want to talk till late, they stay open till dawn. Their food draws on generations of refugees who have settled here: the Greeks who fled Smyrna in 1922 bringing their spiced meats and fish as well as their hashish; the more recent European Union migrants bringing French and Italian wines and ingredients. But their core is Greek. </p> <p>You can see that Greek core even more clearly in the shops, particularly those that cluster around the sprawling markets on Athinas street: cheese shops, such as Zafolia, which sells 50 barrels of feta a day; the herb shops on Sofokleos Street; the olive shops on Sokratou Street; the hams and blackened sausages on Armadiou Street. </p> <p>Despite all the threats of modernity, Athens is still a city where cats sleep on pavements and where lost human beings come to find respect. </p> <p><strong>Five of the best</strong></p> <p><strong> Places to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> 1<strong> Kafeneio</strong> 1 Epiharmou St. The waiter brings a tray of a dozen dishes so you can choose without speaking the language. </p> <p> 2 <strong> Dionysos Cafe</strong> western end of Rovertou Galli St. Great view of the Acropolis, good for breakfast. </p> <p> 3 <strong> Kalokerinos</strong> 10 Kekropos St. Bouzouki band whips customers in to a frenzy. </p> <p> 4 <strong> Platanos</strong> 4 Diogenous St. Looks like the kind of restaurant you might have found in 1930s Paris : clean and simple and delightful. </p> <p> 5 <strong> Fish restaurants</strong> in Tourkolimenos.

Five of the best Places to eat 1 Kafeneio 1 Epiharmou St. The waiter brings a tray of a dozen dishes so you can choose without speaking the language. 2 Dionysos Cafe western end of Rovertou Galli St. Great view of the Acropolis, good for breakfast. 3 Kalokerinos 10 Kekropos St. Bouzouki band whips customers in to a frenzy. 4 Platanos 4 Diogenous St. Looks like the kind of restaurant you might have found in 1930s Paris : clean and simple and delightful. 5 Fish restaurants in Tourkolimenos. Quiet harbour a short taxi ride away from Piraeus station. Places to drink 1 Bakalarakia 41 Kidathineon St. Where the owner makes his own brandy and wines, some of them 45 years old. 2 Apotsos 10 El Venizelou. A plain and simple ouzo house. 3 Diogenes Lysikrates Square. For tranquillity beneath the olive trees. 4 Xynou Aggelou Geronta St. A classic Athenian taverna. 5 Centre of Hellenic Tradition caf\u00e9 upstairs at 36 Pandrossou. A refuge from the heat and the noise of the flea market.",

That's what you get when you pay minimal attention to local politics. Crawling down the main north-south road through villages congested and electric with open-air election rallies, our rep let us know, in the most diplomatic way possible, that we'd be bypassing Colombo (deemed off limits nowadays by the Foreign Office) and advised us that public transport was also not recommended for \"security reasons\". Frankly, we were beyond caring by the time we collapsed in bed. </p> <p>Come morning, things looked brighter: a breakfast of the most luscious pineapple, papaya, passion fruit and lemony bananas with buffalo milk yogurt and palm treacle providing a foretaste of the copious good food that was to come.

All you have to do is hire a driver-guide and do your own thing.

Cinnamon trees grow all around and you can nibble on a fresh leaf or use the leaf stem - as Sri Lankans do - as an aromatic toothpick. The air around Mitiyagoda is pungent with the scent of cinnamon leaves, distilled to make an essential oil (use it for everything from headache to cold feet) and you can see the bark peeled and rolled into sticks before being sun-dried. </p> <p>You have to be self-disciplined not to be sidetracked by this village's other speciality - gems - and one stone in particular, the rare blue flash moonstone. Sri Lanka is world famous for the quality of its gems, though it's the sapphires that are most prized. You can pick up a bargain, or you could get fleeced. </p> <p>Haggling over gems is a thirsty business and the ideal place to chill out is the New Oriental Hotel in Galle, where nothing much has changed since 1684, when it was built as the governor's headquarters for the Dutch Fort, now a World Heritage Site. Sri Lanka still has the most delightfully faded former colonial hotels such as the Queen's Hotel (Kandy) and the Galle Face (Colombo). </p> <p>The staff at the New Oriental pad around in bare feet and serve a pukkah lime soda and the ultimate colonial club sandwich complete with layers of buttery fried egg, bacon and mustard.

But when you get to Kandy, you'll probably be taken up with its romantic lakeside setting and seeing the legendary Temple of the Tooth. </p> <p>The inner sanctum is straight out of Indiana Jones, a golden, gem-studded casket said to contain the Buddha's tooth, set on an altar of blue lilies, guarded by monks in saffron robes. Being a proper town, Kandy is a great place to walk around and see non-tourist life without gathering a retinue of touts. Its food market is fabulous, piled high with unfamiliar ingredients such as banana flowers, manioc leaves and luffa . </p> <p>But if you are in search of Little England, all signs point to high-altitude Nuwara Eliya. A playground for Sri Lankan socialites, the hotels are notoriously old world. The Hill Club, for example, is a baronial pile fit for a Perthshire glen and only recently opened its doors to women.

The inner sanctum is straight out of Indiana Jones, a golden, gem-studded casket said to contain the Buddha's tooth, set on an altar of blue lilies, guarded by monks in saffron robes. Being a proper town, Kandy is a great place to walk around and see non-tourist life without gathering a retinue of touts. Its food market is fabulous, piled high with unfamiliar ingredients such as banana flowers, manioc leaves and luffa . But if you are in search of Little England, all signs point to high-altitude Nuwara Eliya. A playground for Sri Lankan socialites, the hotels are notoriously old world. The Hill Club, for example, is a baronial pile fit for a Perthshire glen and only recently opened its doors to women. For lovers of saggy leather armchairs and kitsch, it's a must-see.",

      "body": "<p>'Will the jet-lag be bad?\" \"We'll find out tomorrow.\" \"It is tomorrow.\" \"And tomorrow and tomorrow.\" </p> <p>I'm talking to Harriet Walter on the plane to Japan. We're playing the Macbeths in the current RSC production - directed by Greg Doran (who's also my partner) - and it's doing a three-week run at Tokyo's Globe Theatre. </p> <p>The jet-lag is severe, and Tokyo's no help. A city in a permanent state of rush-hour. A constant sense of crowd, of commuting, of gridlock. Traffic moves so slowly that televisions are installed on car dashboards. Cyclists have taken to the pavements, whizzing expertly through the thronging pedestrians. In the subway, the trains are frequent, fast and full. Day and night. Everyone seems exhausted. Complete strangers - suited gentlemen and bespectacled housewives - doze on one another's shoulders. Young women are slumped over, forehead to knee. Men strap-hang, asleep on their feet. </p> <p>But if at first Tokyo seems like a cross between Metropolis and Blade Runner, there's another side to it, just evident in the avenues of trees: the branches still have a wintry grey look, but people say the cherry blossom might come out while we're here, and then we'll be truly blessed. </p> <p>Macbeth itself needs no help, luckily - \"sold out\" signs are already up at The Globe. This is a rather unlovely pink concrete building in Shin-Obuko - a lively district crammed with noodle bars and mini-supermarkets - but it houses a very dynamic auditorium, not unlike the Swan in Stratford. </p> <p>Tech-ing the show with the Globe staff, via interpreters, we encounter the astonishing politeness and good-humour that Westerners always note in the Japanese: people really do bow to you all the time, beaming with warmth. Two days later, we open. The atmosphere in the auditorium is electric, the audience concentrated in a way that I've seldom known before. Cynics might say it's the language barrier - simultaneous translation is available through earphones - but I suspect it's also something about Macbeth as a play. </p> <p>Why did Kurosawa's film Throne of Blood serve it so well, I ask a Japanese group after the show, or Ninagawa's more recent stage version? The fall of the man of honour, someone suggests, he's a familiar figure in samurai legend. A fascination with violence - says someone else - it's the other side of the coin, the restraint and respect you visitors always admire in our personality. And it's about a strong wife, the real power behind the throne, chuckles a third; and we know this character, too. </p> <p>On the first weekend, Greg and I visit Hiroshima. Arriving late Sunday night, gazing from our high-rise hotel, there's a familiar neon landscape below, but the next morning, in fresh soft sunlight, the city reveals itself to have a lovely aspect, built across the Otagawa River Delta, with woody hills in between. The buildings are all modern, of course, post 1945, post blast. </p> <p>Hiroshima. The name bangs in our brains, but to the locals it's just home. This is quite hard to absorb as we drive to the Memorial Peace Park, with the taxi's radio playing the Village People hit In The Navy, in Japanese. </p> <p>In the museum you see scorched pocket-watches stopped at 8.15am, and models of Hiroshima before and after that point in time - a whole city here one moment, gone the next - and a full-scale replica of the bomb itself, nicknamed Little Boy. Further in, the sights are even grimmer. The skin of a dead child's finger - peeled away like a prawn shell - kept by the mother to show the father when he returned from the war. </p> <p>Elsewhere, I found myself wishing that the elegantly-lit exhibits of melted roof tiles and glass, like all the shots of mushroom clouds, weren't so bloody beautiful. No such problem in the cinema, where it's impossible to keep watching the screen. The face of one boy has bare-bone jaws, like a skull, yet he's alive. Many of the doctors tending the injured, and the cameramen recording their efforts, would later succumb to radiation sickness; they didn't yet know the danger. </p> <p>Needing fresh air, we go outside. Greg breaks down. I sit numbly trying to make notes. </p> <p>At the other end of the park, one building is preserved from 1945: the Industrial Promotional Hall. Like many of the things we've seen today, it has a skinned look, the brickwork showing pink and fleshy through the grey plaster. Little Boy exploded directly above this spot, right here. </p> <p>We return to Tokyo in a kind of daze. Doing the show is rather dream-like tonight. Theatre seems a little irrelevant. On the other hand, being Shakespeare, some passages sound strangely apt. \"Pity, like a naked new-born babe striding the blast.\" And I have no difficulty picturing Banquo's ghost tonight: his face has bare-bone jaws. </p> <p>Mid-week we do a day-trip to Mount Takao, taking a chair-lift up the steep slopes of towering pines. After the fumes of Tokyo's eternal rush-hour, the mountain air is intoxicating, and the views vast. They'll be even more beautiful in a few days' time. Every bud on every tree is at bursting point. It's like they're awaiting some cue. </p> <p>At the summit, there's a macaque monkey reserve, where you can enter the enclosure. The residents are untidily-furred, stump-tailed and red-faced, with a blushing, shifty look as they dart behind the visitors like pick-pockets. In a flash, one has got Greg's Time Out Guide to Tokyo. For a moment, the animal scans the pages at speed, as if searching for its review, and then, as I've been known to do with Time Out, attacks it with gnashing teeth. After a brief tug-of-war, an attendant returns the book to us, minus two bite-sized chunks. Fortunately, the directions are still intact to Ukai Tor\u00edyama, a renowned restaurant in the neighbouring valley. </p> <p>This is a seriously traditional Japanese eating place - we're the only tourists here today - where separate dining chambers, complete with sliding doors and paper walls, are set among a mossy garden of ponds, water-mills and lacquered bridges. Kimono-clad waitresses bear course after course to your room. Much of the food is excellent, though I must confess a problem with substances that bob or slip. Japanese beer is very good, though, and on the return to Tokyo I join the ranks of slumped commuters. </p> <p>For our second weekend, we board the bullet train, a sleek silver serpent with pointed head on either end, and zip across country to the ancient capital, Kyoto. It's a city of temples and shrines, yet not as serene as this sounds. No sooner have you seen one of the shrines at Kiyomizu-dera - a cluster of temples built on spectacular verandas overhanging the valley - than you find a dozen shops selling its likeness in plastic, cardboard or cake. </p> <p>We proceed to Kyoto's most famous landmark, Kinkaku-ji, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion. This is also the title of Mishima's acclaimed novel, based on a real-life crime here in 1950. A Zen Buddhist student, tortured by physical ugliness and a stammer, became obsessed with the beauty of the 500-year-old, gold-plated temple, poised above its own exquisite reflection in the Mirror Pond, and burned it down. The present building is an exact reconstruction. Fabulous black and gold carp rise from the shallows of the pond, mouths agape, begging from the tourists as shamelessly as the Swans of Avon. </p> <p>Sanjusangen-do Temple is my favourite: a huge, dark hall holding 1,001 gilded statues of Kannon, the deity of mercy. The thousand are life-sized, ranked like an army, and the one is a seated, multi-limbed giant. Mercy might be the theme, but there's also something fantastically brutal here. Gods of thunder and wind snarl at you - wooden figures with crystal eyes, their look both furious and tearful - wrestlers grimace, musicians thrum their drumskins. I reel back into the sunlight. </p> <p>We strike lucky again at Nijo Castle, a magnificent shogun palace. Colossal wooden gates and mossy stone walls outside, shadowy corridors within, the rooms decorated with beautifully simple murals of pine and blossom. </p> <p>Most fascinating are the \"nightingale floors\" whose boards warble as you walk. These weren't built for the magic they put into the atmosphere - it's just a 17th-century security device. </p> <p> During our last week in Tokyo, we attend a matinee performance at the Kabuki Theatre in Ginza. I'm expecting this to be a chore, done in the line of duty, but it's mesmeric. Here is theatre preserved in aspic from 400 years ago, Shakespeare's time. Yet, whereas western classical theatre eschews the art of copying (I don't seek to play Richard III like Olivier, or Macbeth like McKellen), Kabuki cherishes it. Gesture by gesture has been handed down by generations of actors. Especially compelling is the behaviour of the onnagata , the female impersonators. In the one-act play, Shunkan, the fisher-girl is played by Fukusuke with a simpering falsetto, quivery butterfly gestures and a strange sideways totter, which causes her to fall over in any crisis. </p> <p>The performances are all stylised, presented rather than inhabited. In contrast, kneeling to the side of the exceptionally wide stage, the narrator, a sturdy, square-headed man, now growling, now wailing, bears a more passionate, almost enraged relationship to the story. The audience calls out excitedly as a new figure appears on the hanamichi - a ramp through the auditorium - wearing a long-sleeved pink kimono and mask-like white make-up. This is the superstar onnagata , Tamasaburo, who played a notable Lady Macbeth in his youth. Unlike Fukusuke's fragile, fluttery portrait of womankind, Tamasaburo's is altogether more stately and glacial; he slowly performs the elongated steps and held poses of the Cherry Blossom Dance. </p> <p>Outside, the real thing has suddenly bloomed in a spell of warm weather. A whitish pink, or geisha pink, the blossom transforms Tokyo's garish cityscape. On overcast days, the canopies of flowers create their own curious radiance, immensely soft. When there's sunshine, they leap to the eye with an altogether sharper, crystalline clarity. This is deceptive. Touch an individual blossom and its petals instantly break away, taking to the breeze. The spring air is alight with swirls of pinkish snow, the streets lined with it, too. One storm could decimate this spectacle. It's why it's so prized, why the cherry blossom became the symbol of samurai warriors: you fall at the height of your perfection - no withering, no \"sere and yellow leaf\", as Macbeth puts it. </p> <p>So now it's Hanami, cherry blossom time. You expect westerners to be amazed by it, but what's more surprising, and wonderful, is how the locals walk about with their heads back, grinning as though they'd never seen the like before, and lift infants up to the branches. </p> <p>In Ueno Park, the avenues throng with people. Each tree is staked out with a blue tarpaulin underneath, and a lone figure in a sleeping-bag. These are junior office workers, guarding the spot till the others can join. After our last show on Saturday night, and after fulsome and moving farewells at the Globe, Greg and I hurry back to the park. </p> <p>Drink is an essential part of Hanami and the place is crazy with it now. Arriving sober, the impression is of boarding a ship that seems steady under your feet while tossing everyone else about. The park lanterns have been switched off to encourage the crowds to leave, but the semi-darkness is still clamorous with hoarse laughter and song, sexual moans, and the occasional smashing glass. Mountains of litter are stacked everywhere, and teams of paramedics are charging around with wheeled stretchers. </p> <p>We've brought along a little bottle of sake and a sushi lunch-tray, but this party ain't for us. We turn and flee. </p> <p>To understand the Japanese, someone told us, you have to think of them more as a tribe than the citizens of a country; they are, after all, 97% racially intact, which can't be true of many modern societies. Hanami is a good illustration. It's not a street party, not a question of people over-indulging; it's a festival of Nature. The cherry blossom comes suddenly and is over in a few days. While here, it's to be worshipped - intensely, wildly, without inhibition. </p> <p>Back in the safety of our 14th-floor hotel room, we laugh at our own cowardice, our alien-ness here, then open our sake and toast the extraordinary rite of spring going on in Tokyo city tonight. </p> <p>Antony Sher is appearing in the title role of the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Macbeth at the Young Vic until June 3.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>ANA World Wide Tours (020 7478 1911) has return flights from Heathrow to Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Okinawa and Sukuoka from \u00a3631.

      "bodyText": "'Will the jet-lag be bad?\" \"We'll find out tomorrow.\" \"It is tomorrow.\" \"And tomorrow and tomorrow.\" I'm talking to Harriet Walter on the plane to Japan. We're playing the Macbeths in the current RSC production - directed by Greg Doran (who's also my partner) - and it's doing a three-week run at Tokyo's Globe Theatre. The jet-lag is severe, and Tokyo's no help. A city in a permanent state of rush-hour. A constant sense of crowd, of commuting, of gridlock. Traffic moves so slowly that televisions are installed on car dashboards. Cyclists have taken to the pavements, whizzing expertly through the thronging pedestrians. In the subway, the trains are frequent, fast and full. Day and night. Everyone seems exhausted. Complete strangers - suited gentlemen and bespectacled housewives - doze on one another's shoulders. Young women are slumped over, forehead to knee. Men strap-hang, asleep on their feet. But if at first Tokyo seems like a cross between Metropolis and Blade Runner, there's another side to it, just evident in the avenues of trees: the branches still have a wintry grey look, but people say the cherry blossom might come out while we're here, and then we'll be truly blessed. Macbeth itself needs no help, luckily - \"sold out\" signs are already up at The Globe. This is a rather unlovely pink concrete building in Shin-Obuko - a lively district crammed with noodle bars and mini-supermarkets - but it houses a very dynamic auditorium, not unlike the Swan in Stratford. Tech-ing the show with the Globe staff, via interpreters, we encounter the astonishing politeness and good-humour that Westerners always note in the Japanese: people really do bow to you all the time, beaming with warmth. Two days later, we open. The atmosphere in the auditorium is electric, the audience concentrated in a way that I've seldom known before. Cynics might say it's the language barrier - simultaneous translation is available through earphones - but I suspect it's also something about Macbeth as a play. Why did Kurosawa's film Throne of Blood serve it so well, I ask a Japanese group after the show, or Ninagawa's more recent stage version? The fall of the man of honour, someone suggests, he's a familiar figure in samurai legend. A fascination with violence - says someone else - it's the other side of the coin, the restraint and respect you visitors always admire in our personality. And it's about a strong wife, the real power behind the throne, chuckles a third; and we know this character, too. On the first weekend, Greg and I visit Hiroshima. Arriving late Sunday night, gazing from our high-rise hotel, there's a familiar neon landscape below, but the next morning, in fresh soft sunlight, the city reveals itself to have a lovely aspect, built across the Otagawa River Delta, with woody hills in between. The buildings are all modern, of course, post 1945, post blast. Hiroshima. The name bangs in our brains, but to the locals it's just home. This is quite hard to absorb as we drive to the Memorial Peace Park, with the taxi's radio playing the Village People hit In The Navy, in Japanese. In the museum you see scorched pocket-watches stopped at 8.15am, and models of Hiroshima before and after that point in time - a whole city here one moment, gone the next - and a full-scale replica of the bomb itself, nicknamed Little Boy. Further in, the sights are even grimmer. The skin of a dead child's finger - peeled away like a prawn shell - kept by the mother to show the father when he returned from the war. Elsewhere, I found myself wishing that the elegantly-lit exhibits of melted roof tiles and glass, like all the shots of mushroom clouds, weren't so bloody beautiful. No such problem in the cinema, where it's impossible to keep watching the screen. The face of one boy has bare-bone jaws, like a skull, yet he's alive. Many of the doctors tending the injured, and the cameramen recording their efforts, would later succumb to radiation sickness; they didn't yet know the danger. Needing fresh air, we go outside. Greg breaks down. I sit numbly trying to make notes. At the other end of the park, one building is preserved from 1945: the Industrial Promotional Hall. Like many of the things we've seen today, it has a skinned look, the brickwork showing pink and fleshy through the grey plaster. Little Boy exploded directly above this spot, right here. We return to Tokyo in a kind of daze. Doing the show is rather dream-like tonight. Theatre seems a little irrelevant. On the other hand, being Shakespeare, some passages sound strangely apt. \"Pity, like a naked new-born babe striding the blast.\" And I have no difficulty picturing Banquo's ghost tonight: his face has bare-bone jaws. Mid-week we do a day-trip to Mount Takao, taking a chair-lift up the steep slopes of towering pines. After the fumes of Tokyo's eternal rush-hour, the mountain air is intoxicating, and the views vast. They'll be even more beautiful in a few days' time. Every bud on every tree is at bursting point. It's like they're awaiting some cue. At the summit, there's a macaque monkey reserve, where you can enter the enclosure. The residents are untidily-furred, stump-tailed and red-faced, with a blushing, shifty look as they dart behind the visitors like pick-pockets. In a flash, one has got Greg's Time Out Guide to Tokyo. For a moment, the animal scans the pages at speed, as if searching for its review, and then, as I've been known to do with Time Out, attacks it with gnashing teeth. After a brief tug-of-war, an attendant returns the book to us, minus two bite-sized chunks. Fortunately, the directions are still intact to Ukai Tor\u00edyama, a renowned restaurant in the neighbouring valley. This is a seriously traditional Japanese eating place - we're the only tourists here today - where separate dining chambers, complete with sliding doors and paper walls, are set among a mossy garden of ponds, water-mills and lacquered bridges. Kimono-clad waitresses bear course after course to your room. Much of the food is excellent, though I must confess a problem with substances that bob or slip. Japanese beer is very good, though, and on the return to Tokyo I join the ranks of slumped commuters. For our second weekend, we board the bullet train, a sleek silver serpent with pointed head on either end, and zip across country to the ancient capital, Kyoto. It's a city of temples and shrines, yet not as serene as this sounds. No sooner have you seen one of the shrines at Kiyomizu-dera - a cluster of temples built on spectacular verandas overhanging the valley - than you find a dozen shops selling its likeness in plastic, cardboard or cake. We proceed to Kyoto's most famous landmark, Kinkaku-ji, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion. This is also the title of Mishima's acclaimed novel, based on a real-life crime here in 1950. A Zen Buddhist student, tortured by physical ugliness and a stammer, became obsessed with the beauty of the 500-year-old, gold-plated temple, poised above its own exquisite reflection in the Mirror Pond, and burned it down. The present building is an exact reconstruction. Fabulous black and gold carp rise from the shallows of the pond, mouths agape, begging from the tourists as shamelessly as the Swans of Avon. Sanjusangen-do Temple is my favourite: a huge, dark hall holding 1,001 gilded statues of Kannon, the deity of mercy. The thousand are life-sized, ranked like an army, and the one is a seated, multi-limbed giant. Mercy might be the theme, but there's also something fantastically brutal here. Gods of thunder and wind snarl at you - wooden figures with crystal eyes, their look both furious and tearful - wrestlers grimace, musicians thrum their drumskins. I reel back into the sunlight. We strike lucky again at Nijo Castle, a magnificent shogun palace. Colossal wooden gates and mossy stone walls outside, shadowy corridors within, the rooms decorated with beautifully simple murals of pine and blossom. Most fascinating are the \"nightingale floors\" whose boards warble as you walk. These weren't built for the magic they put into the atmosphere - it's just a 17th-century security device. During our last week in Tokyo, we attend a matinee performance at the Kabuki Theatre in Ginza. I'm expecting this to be a chore, done in the line of duty, but it's mesmeric. Here is theatre preserved in aspic from 400 years ago, Shakespeare's time. Yet, whereas western classical theatre eschews the art of copying (I don't seek to play Richard III like Olivier, or Macbeth like McKellen), Kabuki cherishes it. Gesture by gesture has been handed down by generations of actors. Especially compelling is the behaviour of the onnagata , the female impersonators. In the one-act play, Shunkan, the fisher-girl is played by Fukusuke with a simpering falsetto, quivery butterfly gestures and a strange sideways totter, which causes her to fall over in any crisis. The performances are all stylised, presented rather than inhabited. In contrast, kneeling to the side of the exceptionally wide stage, the narrator, a sturdy, square-headed man, now growling, now wailing, bears a more passionate, almost enraged relationship to the story. The audience calls out excitedly as a new figure appears on the hanamichi - a ramp through the auditorium - wearing a long-sleeved pink kimono and mask-like white make-up. This is the superstar onnagata , Tamasaburo, who played a notable Lady Macbeth in his youth. Unlike Fukusuke's fragile, fluttery portrait of womankind, Tamasaburo's is altogether more stately and glacial; he slowly performs the elongated steps and held poses of the Cherry Blossom Dance. Outside, the real thing has suddenly bloomed in a spell of warm weather. A whitish pink, or geisha pink, the blossom transforms Tokyo's garish cityscape. On overcast days, the canopies of flowers create their own curious radiance, immensely soft. When there's sunshine, they leap to the eye with an altogether sharper, crystalline clarity. This is deceptive. Touch an individual blossom and its petals instantly break away, taking to the breeze. The spring air is alight with swirls of pinkish snow, the streets lined with it, too. One storm could decimate this spectacle. It's why it's so prized, why the cherry blossom became the symbol of samurai warriors: you fall at the height of your perfection - no withering, no \"sere and yellow leaf\", as Macbeth puts it. So now it's Hanami, cherry blossom time. You expect westerners to be amazed by it, but what's more surprising, and wonderful, is how the locals walk about with their heads back, grinning as though they'd never seen the like before, and lift infants up to the branches. In Ueno Park, the avenues throng with people. Each tree is staked out with a blue tarpaulin underneath, and a lone figure in a sleeping-bag. These are junior office workers, guarding the spot till the others can join. After our last show on Saturday night, and after fulsome and moving farewells at the Globe, Greg and I hurry back to the park. Drink is an essential part of Hanami and the place is crazy with it now. Arriving sober, the impression is of boarding a ship that seems steady under your feet while tossing everyone else about. The park lanterns have been switched off to encourage the crowds to leave, but the semi-darkness is still clamorous with hoarse laughter and song, sexual moans, and the occasional smashing glass. Mountains of litter are stacked everywhere, and teams of paramedics are charging around with wheeled stretchers. We've brought along a little bottle of sake and a sushi lunch-tray, but this party ain't for us. We turn and flee. To understand the Japanese, someone told us, you have to think of them more as a tribe than the citizens of a country; they are, after all, 97% racially intact, which can't be true of many modern societies. Hanami is a good illustration. It's not a street party, not a question of people over-indulging; it's a festival of Nature. The cherry blossom comes suddenly and is over in a few days. While here, it's to be worshipped - intensely, wildly, without inhibition. Back in the safety of our 14th-floor hotel room, we laugh at our own cowardice, our alien-ness here, then open our sake and toast the extraordinary rite of spring going on in Tokyo city tonight.

      "body": "<p>Few places in the world are better suited to uninterrupted relaxation than Hawaii. Maui wins endless awards as the world's best island and for having Hawaii's most swimmable beaches. Yet, as on all the Hawaiian islands, what is really striking is to discover that the resort areas occupy only a limited, though intensively developed, part of the coastline. Sure, the Elvis Presley version of Hawaii exists. But so do versions you never thought about. </p> <p>Wherever you are in Hawaii, even on the streets of the capital Honolulu, there is always the sense of being cut off from the rest of the world. After all, these spectacular volcanic islands are more than 2,000 miles away from the nearest mainland, the west coast of the US, and it still takes a long time to get here, even by the jets that revolutionised Hawaii's accessibility as a holiday destination. </p> <p>There are more than 100 islands in the chain, and all but a handful of tourists will only ever visit the six main ones - Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kauai. Though Hawaii - otherwise known as the Big Island to avoid confusion - is the largest and highest of the group, Oahu is easily the most visited, and Honolulu is most people's first - and many people's only - port of call. Three-quarters of the 1.2 million inhabitants of Hawaii live on Oahu, and half of those live in Honolulu and its legendary resort of Waikiki. </p> <p><strong> The driving routes</strong><br> </p> <p> It doesn't take long to get away from the crowds. Drive out along the coast road from Waikiki, past the volcanic crater of Diamond Head and a string of suburban settlements, and you will soon come to largely unspoiled coastal scenery. Hanauma Bay, Oahu's over-exploited but dramatic snorkelling centre, is followed by gorgeous beaches at Waimanalo, Lanikai and Kailua, where the waves roll in under the backdrop of stunning hills and cliffs. It feels remote - yet the Gucci life of Waikiki and the wartime memorials of Pearl Harbor are each barely half an hour away. </p> <p>And if it is possible to get away from it all on Oahu, then it is even easier on Maui. We took our hire car on one of the most popular expeditions for visitors to Maui, the 120-mile round-trip drive along the north and east coasts of the island to beyond the remote eastern town - though it's really only a big village - of Hana. And in spite of its deserved popularity, the feeling of remoteness that we found there was just extraordinary. </p> <p>A drive of 120 miles may not sound a lot, but there can't be many places in the world where a distance of that kind takes so long. East of Paia, a nice town with a Pacific hippie feel to it, the narrow coast road begins to twist and climb through tropical rain forest scenery that gets more breathtaking the further east you go. A lot of the time it's impossible to go much more than 15 miles an hour. And who would want to, as the road leads deep into lush gorges, tinkling with the sound of waterfalls, densely overhung with banana trees and bamboos, eucalyptus, orchids and tulip trees. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that the rich and reclusive have made their homes along the road to Hana: George Harrison has long had a house near Nahiku; Woody Harrelson recently bought an estate near Hana; and the aviator Charles Lindbergh came here in the 1970s to live out his last years. </p> <p><strong> The resorts</strong><br> </p> <p> Most of the 2m people who make the trip to Maui each year will stay in one of the island's two main beach resort areas - the Kaanapali-Kapalua area on the west side of West Maui, or the Kihei-Wailea area on the west flanks of the main part of the island. These areas are dominated by large, often beautifully-planned and frequently lavish resort hotel complexes, which lie in a string of premium oceanside sites and which provide every possible incentive for visitors to stay glued to their loungers for sunny day after sunny day. </p> <p>The Outrigger Wailea, where we stayed, is one of the succession of groomed and landscaped resorts stretching along the southern coast of Maui. When we arrived, we were greeted with the lei garlands that have become synonymous with Hawaii, and then by a heart-stoppingly beautiful Pacific sunset. </p> <p>Hawaii is the only state in the US where the indigenous culture has partly held its own against the march of westernisation. But the price of that resistance, for the tourist, is the hard-to-avoid ersatz version of Pacific paradise, with swaying hula dancers, kitschy songs about the charms of the islands, and fixed smiles all round which conceal as much about the realities of traditional Hawaiian life as they reveal. </p> <p><strong> The food</strong><br> </p> <p> Even sceptics should try to get to a lu'au. After all, how often do you get to sit on a lawn by the Pacific on a warm tropical evening, eating local food, listening to hula music, and watching a fire dance? Exactly. And what a menu: saut\u00e9ed island fish with lemon macadamia nut butter, pork, fish and beef with taro steamed in ti leaf, Hawaiian sweet potatoes with coconut milk and honey, chicken long rice, Imu baked Kalua pig, grilled teriyaki steak, Hawaiian fried rice, and stir-fry vegetables, followed by fresh Maui pineapple and papaya slices and a complimentary bar. All for $62 for adults and $28 for under-13s. </p> <p><strong> The activities</strong><br> </p> <p> And then there are the fish: live ones; big ones; and little ones. And the turtles. To say nothing of the whales. Ulua Beach near Wailea is a public beach - as almost all the beaches on Maui are - and provides excellent and safe snorkelling, especially in the morning before the afternoon trade winds make things a little choppy. La Perouse Bay, to the south, is another snorkelling option, and there is a good chance of seeing dolphins, too. </p> <p>But the best way to get top quality snorkelling on Maui is to take a cruise boat. They sail each day from the rapidly developing little harbour at Ma'alaea - which also now sports a fine new Pacific aquarium called the Maui Ocean Centre - and take you for a 40-minute each-way trip down to the tiny uninhabited volcanic island (uninhabited by humans, that is) of Molokini. </p> <p>Here, under the lee of Molokini's cliffs, we swam for an hour amid an amazingly varied array of tropical fish, seemingly of all colours. Later on, when the boat moved on to Turtle Arches, we swam some more, this time among large and gentle sea turtles, which glided up and down from the ocean floor to the surface, an experience unlike any other. </p> <p>Another equally magical cruise option at this time of year is to go on a whale watch. Up to 2,000 Pacific hump-back whales are reckoned to swim south annually from Alaska to Hawaii in the winter, to live and breed in the warm waters around Maui before returning north once more. From November to April, you have a good chance of seeing whales on one of these trips - and they are often visible in the distance even from the shore. Up close, though, the sight of these huge creatures is extraordinarily satisfying. We saw them break the surface and then dive, their huge black tails gleaming. We saw them leap from the ocean, fins outlined, twisting and crashing back into the water on their backs. </p> <p>The Hawaiian islands are so much more dramatic and interesting than I had imagined. All that and sitting under a palm tree drinking a $6 mai tai, too. You soon realise why so many people never want to leave.</p> <p> <strong>Making a mai tai</strong></p> <p> A mai tai is a rum cocktail invented by Victor J \"Trader Vic\" Bergeron in his Oakland restaurant in 1944 and introduced to the Hawaiian islands in the 1950s. When he originally tested it on some Tahitian friends, one was moved to say, \"Mai Tai - Roa Ae\", which means \"Out of This World - The Best\". </p> <p> <strong> The original recipe</strong> * 2oz 17-year-old J Wray Nephew Jamaican rum * 1/2 oz French Garnier Orgeat * 1/2 oz Holland DeKuyper orange curacao * 1/4 oz rock candy syrup * juice from one fresh lime Hand shake and garnish with half of the lime shell inside the drink and float a sprig of fresh mint at the edge of the glass.</p> <p> <strong> Today's recipe </strong> There are many variations, but the ingredients for this one are readily available: * 1oz white rum * 1oz dark rum * 1oz curacao * 1/2 oz amaretto * 1/2 oz grenadine * 1/2 oz lime juice * 1tsp sugar </p> <p><strong>Volcano biking</strong></p> <p>It never occurred to me that I would go to Hawaii and end up describing the numbing cold. I mean, of all the clich\u00e9s in all the world that you might ever read about Hawaii, I don't remember anyone going on very much about their frozen fingers. </p> <p>But that was before I went to the top of Mount Haleakala on the island of Maui at 5am in late March to wait for the dawn. It was pitch dark when we got up to the volcano crater. At 10,000ft above sea level, even here in the tropics, it was very cold indeed. The rain was pouring, and the wind was blowing. We had already been on the road for two hours. It was, in short, about as miserable an experience as you could devise anywhere. Spring break on a paradise island? It felt more like the Pennines. Which is why you are just going to have to take my word for the fact that it was worth it. </p> <p>It wasn't as though we even got to see the sun. As we struggled into our rainwear on Haleakala summit, there was at least the lingering hope that the weather might relent by dawn, still more than an hour distant. But later, as a remarkably large crowd of us early-risers huddled for shelter inside the visitor centre, a park ranger announced that it was 6.20am and that the sun had now duly risen. Outside, everything remained blanketed in impenetrable thick, wet, grey cloud. We took her news on trust. </p> <p>In winter - even Hawaii has seasons - there is at least a 50-50 chance of getting caught in the clouds and the rain at dawn on Mount Haleakala. But even if, like us, you draw a losing ticket and miss what must be the inspiring sight of the sun emerging over the rim of the volcano, there is still an epic reason for making the trip whatever the weather. </p> <p>That reason is the exhilarating downhill bike ride off the mountain. From the crater rim down to the Pacific Ocean at Paia on the north shore of Maui is 39 miles, and with the exception of only a few hundred yards of pedalling, it's downhill all the way. </p> <p>As a result, the summit car park on Haleakala fills up each dawn with minibuses from the rival downhill bike companies, who collect visitors from their hotels, then drive them to the summit before supplying them with custom-built bikes (as well as helmets, gloves and rainwear) for the descent. </p> <p>At the top, on the day we went, the conditions were dire, and several of our party took refuge in the minibus for sections of the journey to warm up and dry out before getting back on their bikes lower down. Those who stuck it for the full 39 miles, such as my elder son, swept down a succession of hairpin bends amid volcanic terrain so bleak that the Apollo astronauts trained up there for their moonwalks, before emerging on to the lusher - and sunnier - lower slopes for the more leisurely second half of the trip. </p> <p>Once we got below the clouds, the views over Maui were stunning. Below us stretched the lush greens of the local vegetation, with smoke rising from the tall chimneys of the island's two remaining sugar cane factories in the flat lowland valley that divides the two halves of Maui. Across from us rose the smaller but more shapely volcanic peaks of West Maui, tipped with thin clouds. To both east and west stretched the blue Pacific, with white waves breaking on distant golden beaches. </p> <p>At moments like this, you realise that Maui, like all the main Hawaiian islands, is a land of extremes. And, in a place that is only 48 miles long and 26 miles wide at its broadest points, you obviously don't have to travel very far to find them. </p> <p>Mount Haleakala bike ride: Maui Downhill (001 808 871 2155, <a href=\"http://www.mauidownhill.net\">www.mauidownhill.net</a>.

      "bodyText": "Few places in the world are better suited to uninterrupted relaxation than Hawaii. Maui wins endless awards as the world's best island and for having Hawaii's most swimmable beaches. Yet, as on all the Hawaiian islands, what is really striking is to discover that the resort areas occupy only a limited, though intensively developed, part of the coastline. Sure, the Elvis Presley version of Hawaii exists. But so do versions you never thought about. Wherever you are in Hawaii, even on the streets of the capital Honolulu, there is always the sense of being cut off from the rest of the world. After all, these spectacular volcanic islands are more than 2,000 miles away from the nearest mainland, the west coast of the US, and it still takes a long time to get here, even by the jets that revolutionised Hawaii's accessibility as a holiday destination. There are more than 100 islands in the chain, and all but a handful of tourists will only ever visit the six main ones - Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kauai. Though Hawaii - otherwise known as the Big Island to avoid confusion - is the largest and highest of the group, Oahu is easily the most visited, and Honolulu is most people's first - and many people's only - port of call. Three-quarters of the 1.2 million inhabitants of Hawaii live on Oahu, and half of those live in Honolulu and its legendary resort of Waikiki. The driving routes It doesn't take long to get away from the crowds. Drive out along the coast road from Waikiki, past the volcanic crater of Diamond Head and a string of suburban settlements, and you will soon come to largely unspoiled coastal scenery. Hanauma Bay, Oahu's over-exploited but dramatic snorkelling centre, is followed by gorgeous beaches at Waimanalo, Lanikai and Kailua, where the waves roll in under the backdrop of stunning hills and cliffs. It feels remote - yet the Gucci life of Waikiki and the wartime memorials of Pearl Harbor are each barely half an hour away. And if it is possible to get away from it all on Oahu, then it is even easier on Maui. We took our hire car on one of the most popular expeditions for visitors to Maui, the 120-mile round-trip drive along the north and east coasts of the island to beyond the remote eastern town - though it's really only a big village - of Hana. And in spite of its deserved popularity, the feeling of remoteness that we found there was just extraordinary. A drive of 120 miles may not sound a lot, but there can't be many places in the world where a distance of that kind takes so long. East of Paia, a nice town with a Pacific hippie feel to it, the narrow coast road begins to twist and climb through tropical rain forest scenery that gets more breathtaking the further east you go. A lot of the time it's impossible to go much more than 15 miles an hour. And who would want to, as the road leads deep into lush gorges, tinkling with the sound of waterfalls, densely overhung with banana trees and bamboos, eucalyptus, orchids and tulip trees. It is hardly surprising that the rich and reclusive have made their homes along the road to Hana: George Harrison has long had a house near Nahiku; Woody Harrelson recently bought an estate near Hana; and the aviator Charles Lindbergh came here in the 1970s to live out his last years. The resorts Most of the 2m people who make the trip to Maui each year will stay in one of the island's two main beach resort areas - the Kaanapali-Kapalua area on the west side of West Maui, or the Kihei-Wailea area on the west flanks of the main part of the island. These areas are dominated by large, often beautifully-planned and frequently lavish resort hotel complexes, which lie in a string of premium oceanside sites and which provide every possible incentive for visitors to stay glued to their loungers for sunny day after sunny day. The Outrigger Wailea, where we stayed, is one of the succession of groomed and landscaped resorts stretching along the southern coast of Maui. When we arrived, we were greeted with the lei garlands that have become synonymous with Hawaii, and then by a heart-stoppingly beautiful Pacific sunset. Hawaii is the only state in the US where the indigenous culture has partly held its own against the march of westernisation. But the price of that resistance, for the tourist, is the hard-to-avoid ersatz version of Pacific paradise, with swaying hula dancers, kitschy songs about the charms of the islands, and fixed smiles all round which conceal as much about the realities of traditional Hawaiian life as they reveal. The food Even sceptics should try to get to a lu'au. After all, how often do you get to sit on a lawn by the Pacific on a warm tropical evening, eating local food, listening to hula music, and watching a fire dance? Exactly. And what a menu: saut\u00e9ed island fish with lemon macadamia nut butter, pork, fish and beef with taro steamed in ti leaf, Hawaiian sweet potatoes with coconut milk and honey, chicken long rice, Imu baked Kalua pig, grilled teriyaki steak, Hawaiian fried rice, and stir-fry vegetables, followed by fresh Maui pineapple and papaya slices and a complimentary bar. All for $62 for adults and $28 for under-13s. The activities And then there are the fish: live ones; big ones; and little ones. And the turtles. To say nothing of the whales. Ulua Beach near Wailea is a public beach - as almost all the beaches on Maui are - and provides excellent and safe snorkelling, especially in the morning before the afternoon trade winds make things a little choppy. La Perouse Bay, to the south, is another snorkelling option, and there is a good chance of seeing dolphins, too. But the best way to get top quality snorkelling on Maui is to take a cruise boat. They sail each day from the rapidly developing little harbour at Ma'alaea - which also now sports a fine new Pacific aquarium called the Maui Ocean Centre - and take you for a 40-minute each-way trip down to the tiny uninhabited volcanic island (uninhabited by humans, that is) of Molokini. Here, under the lee of Molokini's cliffs, we swam for an hour amid an amazingly varied array of tropical fish, seemingly of all colours. Later on, when the boat moved on to Turtle Arches, we swam some more, this time among large and gentle sea turtles, which glided up and down from the ocean floor to the surface, an experience unlike any other. Another equally magical cruise option at this time of year is to go on a whale watch. Up to 2,000 Pacific hump-back whales are reckoned to swim south annually from Alaska to Hawaii in the winter, to live and breed in the warm waters around Maui before returning north once more.

We saw them leap from the ocean, fins outlined, twisting and crashing back into the water on their backs. The Hawaiian islands are so much more dramatic and interesting than I had imagined.

Making a mai tai A mai tai is a rum cocktail invented by Victor J \"Trader Vic\" Bergeron in his Oakland restaurant in 1944 and introduced to the Hawaiian islands in the 1950s. When he originally tested it on some Tahitian friends, one was moved to say, \"Mai Tai - Roa Ae\", which means \"Out of This World - The Best\". The original recipe * 2oz 17-year-old J Wray Nephew Jamaican rum * 1/2 oz French Garnier Orgeat * 1/2 oz Holland DeKuyper orange curacao * 1/4 oz rock candy syrup * juice from one fresh lime Hand shake and garnish with half of the lime shell inside the drink and float a sprig of fresh mint at the edge of the glass. Today's recipe There are many variations, but the ingredients for this one are readily available: * 1oz white rum * 1oz dark rum * 1oz curacao * 1/2 oz amaretto * 1/2 oz grenadine * 1/2 oz lime juice * 1tsp sugar Volcano biking It never occurred to me that I would go to Hawaii and end up describing the numbing cold.

      "body": "<p>George Soros, the international financier who \"broke the pound\", yesterday admitted he had been beaten by billions of dollars of losses through misguided investments in technology companies. </p> <p>The 69-year-old Hungarian-born multimillionaire said \"we are bringing an epoch to an end\" as he announced a radical restructuring of his huge hedge fund operation and the departure of his two closest lieutenants. </p> <p>In a letter to his clients, he said his high-profile Quantum Fund, which since the end of December has fallen in value from $10.4bn (\u00a36.7bn) to $8bn, would be converted \"into a lower risk or lower reward operation\". </p> <p>He annnounced the unexpected retirement of Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief investment officer who guided the fund to its $10bn bet against the Bank of England in 1992 and who was regarded as his successor, and Nick Roditi, the Zimbabwean London-based manager. </p> <p>The two executives had run the two best-known Soros funds, Quantum and Quota, which analysts said yesterday would suffer client defections as a result of their departure. </p> <p>Mr Druckenmiller, who previously had the power to move markets around the world, admitted he had been caught out by falls in the Nasdaq technology index in the US. \"I screwed up. I should have got out in February,\" he said. </p> <p>The size of the bets placed by the funds had given Mr Soros legendary status and allowed his pronouncements to make or break markets. </p> <p>Like other hedge funds, the managers often borrowed to place their large bets - which exaggerated their profits but also exacerbated their losses. </p> <p>Last night Mr Soros acknowledged that the markets had changed, becoming \"extremely unstable\", and that traditional valuation methods no longer applied. </p> <p>\"In taking this step my objective is to establish an organisation that can efficiently administer my funds and those of other shareholders, even beyond my lifetime,\" he said - adding he wanted a \"more reliable stream of income for my charitable activities\". </p> <p>He continued: \"We've come to realise that a large hedge fund like Quantum is no longer the best way to manage money. Quantum Fund is far too big, and its activities too closely watched by the market to be able to operate successfully in the market.\" </p> <p>The former Soros fund manager described the announcement as the biggest news to hit the hedge fund industry in more than a decade. </p> <p>\"Here is a man [Soros] who probably has one of the best records of investing in capital markets and has taken some of the biggest bets effectively withdrawing from the hedge fund arena,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "George Soros, the international financier who \"broke the pound\", yesterday admitted he had been beaten by billions of dollars of losses through misguided investments in technology companies. The 69-year-old Hungarian-born multimillionaire said \"we are bringing an epoch to an end\" as he announced a radical restructuring of his huge hedge fund operation and the departure of his two closest lieutenants. In a letter to his clients, he said his high-profile Quantum Fund, which since the end of December has fallen in value from $10.4bn (\u00a36.7bn) to $8bn, would be converted \"into a lower risk or lower reward operation\". He annnounced the unexpected retirement of Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief investment officer who guided the fund to its $10bn bet against the Bank of England in 1992 and who was regarded as his successor, and Nick Roditi, the Zimbabwean London-based manager. The two executives had run the two best-known Soros funds, Quantum and Quota, which analysts said yesterday would suffer client defections as a result of their departure. Mr Druckenmiller, who previously had the power to move markets around the world, admitted he had been caught out by falls in the Nasdaq technology index in the US. \"I screwed up. I should have got out in February,\" he said. The size of the bets placed by the funds had given Mr Soros legendary status and allowed his pronouncements to make or break markets. Like other hedge funds, the managers often borrowed to place their large bets - which exaggerated their profits but also exacerbated their losses. Last night Mr Soros acknowledged that the markets had changed, becoming \"extremely unstable\", and that traditional valuation methods no longer applied. \"In taking this step my objective is to establish an organisation that can efficiently administer my funds and those of other shareholders, even beyond my lifetime,\" he said - adding he wanted a \"more reliable stream of income for my charitable activities\". He continued: \"We've come to realise that a large hedge fund like Quantum is no longer the best way to manage money. Quantum Fund is far too big, and its activities too closely watched by the market to be able to operate successfully in the market.\" The former Soros fund manager described the announcement as the biggest news to hit the hedge fund industry in more than a decade. \"Here is a man [Soros] who probably has one of the best records of investing in capital markets and has taken some of the biggest bets effectively withdrawing from the hedge fund arena,\" he said. The Soros funds have been hit hard by bets on internet and telecommunications stocks that have failed to pay off. In one month they are understood to have lost as much as $5bn. Their highly leveraged positions on the Nasdaq Composite index misfired when the benchmark for technology stocks fell by a third last month. Nicola Meaden, director of Tass, a hedge fund research group, said: \"Without these two established fund managers investors will be very nervous.\" Mr Soros said shareholders would be given the choice of remaining in Quota Fund, moving to the portion managed by that adviser or taking cash if they withdraw their funds. Ironically the Soros funds had performed relatively well over the past year as the group belatedly bought into the hi-tech shares market. The Quantum Fund, which will be renamed the Quantum Endowment Fund, was up by about 2% in the first quarter of this year while the Quota fund was up about 12%, according to Tass. Mr Soros said the name change would allow the history of the Quantum Fund, which has provided shareholders with an annual return of more than 30% during its 31-year history, to be preserved as \"a monument more lasting than bronze\". The shake-up comes a month after tech stock vagaries helped prompt Julian Robertson to close Tiger Management, formerly the world's second largest hedge fund group.",

But winning the battle will not be easy. Persuasion will not work alone. We need to be ready to punish, and to punish heavily. This week, it was reported that the Home Office and the Department of Transport may be considering increasing maximum fines for speeding to include jail for those who exceed the limit by more than 30mph.</p> <p>Our recent report on road traffic law showed very clearly that it works on two levels. The law punishes the transgressor; the enforcement of the law sends out a message to society. At the moment, too many motorists think that they can get away with breaking the speed limit: 70% break 30mph limits, and it is those infringements of the limit that cause the majority of crashes that kill cyclists and pedestrians.

Instead of heading home to partners or mates, huge numbers of office workers storm the nearest pub to drink and discuss the day - often until closing time. </p> <p>\"I see my friends at the weekend,\" says IT recruitment adviser Nick Wells, \"but in the week I hang out with people from work. Everyone from our firm goes to the same pub - it's like a members club and it's a really great way to meet people from other departments. Occasionally there's a few embarrassed faces the next day but people rarely overstep the mark.\" </p> <p>Socialising with work colleagues is an important part of office life - and surprisingly it's often the hardest part to get right. \"After-work socialising is a very blurry area,\" says business consultant Tom Peterson. </p> <p>\"At work there are structures and routines - and when we are socialising with friends then we are relaxed and things are easy. Socialising with workmates is somewhere between the two - and it can be hard, particularly when you start in a new company with unfamiliar people, to get the balance right.\" </p> <p>No-one knows this better than Lucy Jones, who works as a solicitor in a large legal firm. \"We were at a wine bar for someone's leaving do, and I found myself sitting next to Angus, my head of department. We were chatting and getting on very well and I failed to notice the amount of wine I was drinking.\" All was fine, until Lucy decided to tackle some inter-office matters. </p> <p>\"Angus seemed so approachable that I started to tell him how we all knew that he didn't like the guy who was head of our section - and how embarrassing it was that he constantly put him down and patronised him in front of us.

      "bodyText": "After-work drinking is a particularly English sport. Instead of heading home to partners or mates, huge numbers of office workers storm the nearest pub to drink and discuss the day - often until closing time. \"I see my friends at the weekend,\" says IT recruitment adviser Nick Wells, \"but in the week I hang out with people from work. Everyone from our firm goes to the same pub - it's like a members club and it's a really great way to meet people from other departments. Occasionally there's a few embarrassed faces the next day but people rarely overstep the mark.\" Socialising with work colleagues is an important part of office life - and surprisingly it's often the hardest part to get right. \"After-work socialising is a very blurry area,\" says business consultant Tom Peterson. \"At work there are structures and routines - and when we are socialising with friends then we are relaxed and things are easy. Socialising with workmates is somewhere between the two - and it can be hard, particularly when you start in a new company with unfamiliar people, to get the balance right.\" No-one knows this better than Lucy Jones, who works as a solicitor in a large legal firm. \"We were at a wine bar for someone's leaving do, and I found myself sitting next to Angus, my head of department. We were chatting and getting on very well and I failed to notice the amount of wine I was drinking.\" All was fine, until Lucy decided to tackle some inter-office matters. \"Angus seemed so approachable that I started to tell him how we all knew that he didn't like the guy who was head of our section - and how embarrassing it was that he constantly put him down and patronised him in front of us. At the time he seemed really interested and asked me for more details - which at the time I was delighted to give.\" Despite hoping that all would be forgotten the next morning, Jones was summoned to the department head's office and informed that action would have to be taken. \"Nothing dreadful happened, but there was a long meeting between Angus and our head of section.

      "body": "<p>Amanda McKinney, a marketing analyst at Standard Life took two weeks off last June. However, unlike many of her colleagues, McKinney was not using her holiday to relax and unwind from the daily grind. </p> <p>Instead, she was hard at work studying for the Chartered Institute of Marketing diploma. Two years after graduating from Strathclyde University with a 2.1 in International Business, McKinney had decided she needed to back up her academic success with a professional qualification. </p> <p>\"Marketing is quite competitive,\" she says, \"and I felt it would improve my career opportunities if I could improve my core knowledge.\" </p> <p>She isn't alone in believing that professional qualifications can help </p> <p>when it comes to careers advancement. A recent study of graduate members of the Institute of Personnel and Development - all of whom had completed the </p> <p>equivalent of a post-graduate diploma - revealed that 99% felt it had proved an appropriate route for career advancement. </p> <p>But the importance of professional qualifications varies enormously between different industries. In some professions, such as accountancy, a professional qualification is considered a prerequisite for any accountancy </p> <p>graduate planning to forge a career in the profession. </p> <p>\"Most of our trainees are employed by the big accountancy firms and are planning to go ahead into public practice,\" says Professor Brian Chiplin, director of </p> <p>education and training at the Chartered Institute of Accountants. \"In this industry credentials are important. It signifies that you've reached a standard and that you are marketable around the world.\" </p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Accountants has recently revised the ACA - the chartered accountancy qualification - to make it more business-focused. \"If the intellectual qualification is stamped by a university, the professional qualification offers a seal of approval of practical experience,\" says Chiplin. </p> <p>While a high-flying accountancy graduate will almost certainly sign up for a professional qualification, in other areas such as marketing or </p> <p>engineering, young professionals remain free to decide whether or not to add a professional qualification to their bow. </p> <p>\"Engineers have a choice,\" says Juliet Upton, deputy director of public affairs at the Engineering Council. \"They can do their degree and go no further - there is no statutory registration of engineers.\" </p> <p> Yet Upton believes that the fact that it is possible to get a job without one has lead many recent entrants into the industry to overlook the benefits associated with a professional qualification. \"It demonstrates a professional competence and provides an international standard for knowledge and experience, making it easier to go and work overseas,\" she says. \"It also has a number of personal benefits, such as providing recognition and status, particularly among your industry peers. In addition, once you have a qualification, you're linked into a professional institution which brings with it networking opportunities and career </p> <p>opportunities such as access to further training courses, industry </p> <p>publications and mentors. In that respect it is good value.\" </p> <p>This view is backed up by David Royston-Lee, chief executive of the </p> <p>Communication, Advertising and Marketing Education Foundation. The CAM Foundation offers a number of qualifications. At the basic level is the advanced certificate, which can be taken in six subjects within the marketing communications arena including advertising, direct marketing and </p> <p>sales promotion. Take all six and you get an advanced diploma and you can then go on to study for a higher diploma or higher certificate. </p> <p>\"The emphasis is on giving people who take CAM courses employability within the marketplace and the ability to communicate with clients on all levels of marketing communication,\" says Royston-Lee. </p> <p> Sue Zerk, senior manager in marketing communications for British Airways, gained a CAM diploma in advertising four years ago while with a former employer, the Australian Tourist Commission. Recently promoted from head of global advertising at BA, she remains firmly convinced that the knowledge and tools picked up from her CAM studies continue to help her today. </p> <p>\"When you are working, you become very focused on your immediate responsibilities and you rarely get the opportunity to take a more strategic view from a higher level,\" she says. \"If you go beyond this and learn the accepted business models, it gives you new ways of doing things.\" </p> <p>For this reason, most graduates follow a similar route to Zerk and McKinney and wait until they have some solid workplace experience before signing up for a professional qualification. </p> <p>\"Some people signed up straight after finals,\" says McKinney, \"but I felt it was better to get work experience because the course is so practical. Study was much more theoretical at university.\" </p> <p>Another advantage of waiting until you are in a full-time job before doing a professional qualification is that many employers will offer to finance your studies. Standard Life paid for the cost of McKinney's CIM diploma </p> <p>and also offered money towards books. </p> <p>The reason forward-thinking employers are often prepared to do this is because they realise that a professional qualification can add to the worth of their employees. </p> <p> \"BA has excellent development opportunities internally but if people are interested in gaining more knowledge I think it is very important to encourage that,\" says Zerk. \"We encourage people to pursue qualifications as a development opportunity.\" </p> <p>A professional qualification demonstrates an individual is committed to a profession - always an advantage in the eyes of an employer. Peter Purdom, director of online careers advisor, workingfutures.com, believes it can sometimes be invaluable. </p> <p>\"If employers advertise and are faced with a myriad of application forms, they arbitrarily shortlist,\" he says. \"They look at degree, professional qualification or sector experience - it's an easy eliminator.\" </p> <p>However before you rush out to sign up, be warned. Studying for a </p> <p>professional qualification is likely to involve sacrificing your spare time. </p> <p>Budding accountants can spend several years burning the midnight oil to get the necessary professional qualification. In other professions the demands are less rigorous. The CAM Foundation advises prospective students that they </p> <p>are likely to need to set aside around 50 hours for \"guided study\" per module. Meanwhile, the Chartered Institute of Marketing suggests that prospective students set aside 90 hours of study time per subject and at each level a student is required to study four subjects. </p> <p>\"It was more work than I thought it would be,\" says McKinney. \"That's why I had to take two weeks off before the exam.\"</p>",

It signifies that you've reached a standard and that you are marketable around the world.\" The Chartered Institute of Accountants has recently revised the ACA - the chartered accountancy qualification - to make it more business-focused. \"If the intellectual qualification is stamped by a university, the professional qualification offers a seal of approval of practical experience,\" says Chiplin. While a high-flying accountancy graduate will almost certainly sign up for a professional qualification, in other areas such as marketing or engineering, young professionals remain free to decide whether or not to add a professional qualification to their bow. \"Engineers have a choice,\" says Juliet Upton, deputy director of public affairs at the Engineering Council. \"They can do their degree and go no further - there is no statutory registration of engineers.\" Yet Upton believes that the fact that it is possible to get a job without one has lead many recent entrants into the industry to overlook the benefits associated with a professional qualification. \"It demonstrates a professional competence and provides an international standard for knowledge and experience, making it easier to go and work overseas,\" she says. \"It also has a number of personal benefits, such as providing recognition and status, particularly among your industry peers. In addition, once you have a qualification, you're linked into a professional institution which brings with it networking opportunities and career opportunities such as access to further training courses, industry publications and mentors. In that respect it is good value.\" This view is backed up by David Royston-Lee, chief executive of the Communication, Advertising and Marketing Education Foundation. The CAM Foundation offers a number of qualifications. At the basic level is the advanced certificate, which can be taken in six subjects within the marketing communications arena including advertising, direct marketing and sales promotion. Take all six and you get an advanced diploma and you can then go on to study for a higher diploma or higher certificate. \"The emphasis is on giving people who take CAM courses employability within the marketplace and the ability to communicate with clients on all levels of marketing communication,\" says Royston-Lee. Sue Zerk, senior manager in marketing communications for British Airways, gained a CAM diploma in advertising four years ago while with a former employer, the Australian Tourist Commission. Recently promoted from head of global advertising at BA, she remains firmly convinced that the knowledge and tools picked up from her CAM studies continue to help her today. \"When you are working, you become very focused on your immediate responsibilities and you rarely get the opportunity to take a more strategic view from a higher level,\" she says. \"If you go beyond this and learn the accepted business models, it gives you new ways of doing things.\" For this reason, most graduates follow a similar route to Zerk and McKinney and wait until they have some solid workplace experience before signing up for a professional qualification. \"Some people signed up straight after finals,\" says McKinney, \"but I felt it was better to get work experience because the course is so practical. Study was much more theoretical at university.\" Another advantage of waiting until you are in a full-time job before doing a professional qualification is that many employers will offer to finance your studies. Standard Life paid for the cost of McKinney's CIM diploma and also offered money towards books. The reason forward-thinking employers are often prepared to do this is because they realise that a professional qualification can add to the worth of their employees. \"BA has excellent development opportunities internally but if people are interested in gaining more knowledge I think it is very important to encourage that,\" says Zerk. \"We encourage people to pursue qualifications as a development opportunity.\" A professional qualification demonstrates an individual is committed to a profession - always an advantage in the eyes of an employer. Peter Purdom, director of online careers advisor, workingfutures.com, believes it can sometimes be invaluable. \"If employers advertise and are faced with a myriad of application forms, they arbitrarily shortlist,\" he says. \"They look at degree, professional qualification or sector experience - it's an easy eliminator.\" However before you rush out to sign up, be warned. Studying for a professional qualification is likely to involve sacrificing your spare time. Budding accountants can spend several years burning the midnight oil to get the necessary professional qualification. In other professions the demands are less rigorous. The CAM Foundation advises prospective students that they are likely to need to set aside around 50 hours for \"guided study\" per module. Meanwhile, the Chartered Institute of Marketing suggests that prospective students set aside 90 hours of study time per subject and at each level a student is required to study four subjects. \"It was more work than I thought it would be,\" says McKinney. \"That's why I had to take two weeks off before the exam.\"",

Neither will we mention This Life, the film deal or the acres of feature coverage that Jenkins's CV and cheerful good looks seem to elicit. Rather, we shall concentrate on the text. </p> <p>Honeymoon is the latest addition to that stable of books dedicated to soothing the night terrors of fretful metropolitan spinsters as they contemplate their 30s without a man in tow. Do these freaks of nature really exist in the numbers that send books soaring to the top of the bestseller lists? Reports of a man shortage notwithstanding, it seems unlikely, so one must presume that other women, in various states of partnerhood, also get their kicks from reading about their sisters' sorry love lives. </p> <p>Honeymoon at least has a twist - aside from the cringingly awful gag that the central character is actually called Honeymoon, or Honey for short, as that's where she was conceived. (Her sister is called Venice. Try not to think about this for too long, or it will depress you.) Mercifully, her wacky parents are no longer around to get up to more hilarious antics, having been aboard a plane that went down somewhere over Mexico when Honey was 12. </p> <p>Honey has in fact found a man, the extraordinarily nice landscape gardener Ed, who is so enamoured of every last shred of her narcissistic, neurotic little personality that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. She, as the novel opens, is riding around London in a stretch limo (see above), whooping it up on her hen night. </p> <p>But despite, or perhaps because of, the tender ministrations of the gullible Ed, Honey is far from happy. For one thing, she seems to find her fianc\u00e9 rather indifferent company. To this we must say that anyone who can remain indifferent to a lover who strews their flat with rose petals and is constantly ripping their clothes off in order to ravish them needs to lower their expectations of life drastically. However, behind this facade of ambivalence lies a far darker truth. </p> <p>Honey, you see, once met a man who didn't call. (Once? Once?) He was sitting in a restaurant eating risotto. So was she. Their eyes met, and \"looking away wasn't an option he had me wired straight into his soul\" (sic). Thus wired, the pair abandoned their dining companions and fled in a cab back to her place, where - and this is how she could tell it was the Real Thing - they didn't Do It. In the morning he trotted back to LA to produce commercials, and she waited for the phone to ring. Seven years later, it still hasn't, so she's throwing caution to the winds and marrying someone else. </p> <p>That's the set-up. The follow-through involves all the staples of spinster fiction. There's a large cast of supporting characters, including a ballsy best friend, a cigar-puffing Hollywood movie type, a rehab-refugee Hollywood wannabe, the obligatory homosexual, a feng shui consultant and a wise Irish woman. No one's happy unless they're getting on or off a plane (they've put luckless ma and pa out of their minds, obviously), holding frantic \"What shall we do now?\" conversations on mobile phones or attending starry film premieres that are disrupted by gunmen and helicopters. Suffice it to say that Mr Risotto makes a reappearance, Honey gets terribly confused, and it's a miracle that a vicar doesn't appear through the french windows. </p> <p>Farcical though the plot might be, this is farce with pretensions. Jenkins clearly fancies herself as a bit of a comedian, particularly when it comes to sending up the zeitgeist: lap-dancers, DVD players, M&amp;S, condoms, yoga, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, depilatory cream and reduced-fat hummus are all pressed into the service of her clunking wit as the one-liners extend for line after dreary line. </p> <p>But if the comedy could make you weep, then the tragedy certainly puts a smile on your face. Not only has Honey been orphaned, not only has she had to cope with losing The One, but cruel fate has also deprived her of Red Ted - not, as one briefly hopes, a description of her disillusionment with left-wing politics, but a reference to a childhood trauma involving a teddy bear and the pitiless maw of a dustcart. No wonder she's screwed up. \"I'm not too sure what existential means,\" notes Honey, before hazarding a guess that it might be \"something to do with the meaning of life\".

      "bodyText": "Honeymoon Amy Jenkins Hodder, \u00a310, 362pp Buy it at BOL In the interests of the purity of literary criticism, we shall pass quickly over the \u00a3600,000 advance that Amy Jenkins secured for this and another yet-to-be-written novel, after her publishers had convinced her that they - in the words of the strapline for the book - were \"the love of her life\" by escorting her to their offices in a stretch limousine, showering her with confetti and getting their chequebook out. Neither will we mention This Life, the film deal or the acres of feature coverage that Jenkins's CV and cheerful good looks seem to elicit. Rather, we shall concentrate on the text. Honeymoon is the latest addition to that stable of books dedicated to soothing the night terrors of fretful metropolitan spinsters as they contemplate their 30s without a man in tow. Do these freaks of nature really exist in the numbers that send books soaring to the top of the bestseller lists? Reports of a man shortage notwithstanding, it seems unlikely, so one must presume that other women, in various states of partnerhood, also get their kicks from reading about their sisters' sorry love lives. Honeymoon at least has a twist - aside from the cringingly awful gag that the central character is actually called Honeymoon, or Honey for short, as that's where she was conceived. (Her sister is called Venice. Try not to think about this for too long, or it will depress you.) Mercifully, her wacky parents are no longer around to get up to more hilarious antics, having been aboard a plane that went down somewhere over Mexico when Honey was 12. Honey has in fact found a man, the extraordinarily nice landscape gardener Ed, who is so enamoured of every last shred of her narcissistic, neurotic little personality that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. She, as the novel opens, is riding around London in a stretch limo (see above), whooping it up on her hen night. But despite, or perhaps because of, the tender ministrations of the gullible Ed, Honey is far from happy. For one thing, she seems to find her fianc\u00e9 rather indifferent company. To this we must say that anyone who can remain indifferent to a lover who strews their flat with rose petals and is constantly ripping their clothes off in order to ravish them needs to lower their expectations of life drastically. However, behind this facade of ambivalence lies a far darker truth. Honey, you see, once met a man who didn't call. (Once? Once?) He was sitting in a restaurant eating risotto. So was she. Their eyes met, and \"looking away wasn't an option he had me wired straight into his soul\" (sic). Thus wired, the pair abandoned their dining companions and fled in a cab back to her place, where - and this is how she could tell it was the Real Thing - they didn't Do It. In the morning he trotted back to LA to produce commercials, and she waited for the phone to ring. Seven years later, it still hasn't, so she's throwing caution to the winds and marrying someone else. That's the set-up. The follow-through involves all the staples of spinster fiction. There's a large cast of supporting characters, including a ballsy best friend, a cigar-puffing Hollywood movie type, a rehab-refugee Hollywood wannabe, the obligatory homosexual, a feng shui consultant and a wise Irish woman. No one's happy unless they're getting on or off a plane (they've put luckless ma and pa out of their minds, obviously), holding frantic \"What shall we do now?\" conversations on mobile phones or attending starry film premieres that are disrupted by gunmen and helicopters. Suffice it to say that Mr Risotto makes a reappearance, Honey gets terribly confused, and it's a miracle that a vicar doesn't appear through the french windows. Farcical though the plot might be, this is farce with pretensions. Jenkins clearly fancies herself as a bit of a comedian, particularly when it comes to sending up the zeitgeist: lap-dancers, DVD players, M&amp;S, condoms, yoga, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, depilatory cream and reduced-fat hummus are all pressed into the service of her clunking wit as the one-liners extend for line after dreary line. But if the comedy could make you weep, then the tragedy certainly puts a smile on your face. Not only has Honey been orphaned, not only has she had to cope with losing The One, but cruel fate has also deprived her of Red Ted - not, as one briefly hopes, a description of her disillusionment with left-wing politics, but a reference to a childhood trauma involving a teddy bear and the pitiless maw of a dustcart. No wonder she's screwed up. \"I'm not too sure what existential means,\" notes Honey, before hazarding a guess that it might be \"something to do with the meaning of life\". Er, don't worry about it, sweetheart, it's probably not that important. Perhaps the best that we might say is that Jenkins has redefined the notion of a page-turner. Such is her authorial exuberance that a nervous reader will experience palpitations worrying about how she can possibly tie up all the loose ends and yet come up with a finale that convinces on psychological, social, literary, comedic and tragic levels. Others might wonder at the spectacle of an extremely rich and successful young woman who is clearly not stupid writing a book purely to tell us that, however streetwise and ironic we think ourselves, however much we scorn white weddings, red roses and purple prose, we're all gagging for them really.

      "body": "<p>I am not the happiest person. In fact, in the battle between joy and misery, I'd say that the latter often seems to prevail. But I do have one thing on my side: I have enormous faith. And hope. I am not speaking of the kind you find in church or in the afterlife, I am speaking of a simple faith that says that one way or another, no matter how many times I stumble and stub my big toe, somehow life is going to work itself out. Being human, we all kind of want the same things, to love and be loved, and all that. And in the rules I've laid out here, I believe I have found the secret of life. </p> <p><strong> Don't Clear the Table at a Dinner Party Unless the Men Get Up to Help, Too </strong><br> </p> <p> You know how it is. Friends are trying to be domestic and act grown up by having a bunch of people over for a meal. Invariably, the risotto will be too sticky, the salmon overcooked, the dill sauce too salty - but the effort will, of course, be the whole point. You will feel, momentarily, as mature as your parents were at your age. And to be appreciative and well mannered, between courses and at the end of the meal, you and others will get up to clear the table and help wash the dishes. </p> <p>Now, as it happens, I have it from those who know about etiquette, that when you are a guest at somebody else's table, you need not offer to help, in fact you should let your hosts attend to all the post-repast cleaning. But because these good manners were formulated with butlers and maids figured in, it is probably acceptable and desirable to help with the clean-up effort. </p> <p>But not if the men don't. Clean-up tasks should not be gendered. </p> <p>Do you want to know how you can change the whole world, one dinner table at a time? By holding a sit-in! By refusing to be helpful unless the men are! Stay in your chair, savour a few more sips of your wine, finish the last spoons of your melting orange-kumquat sorbet, and refuse to participate in a process that maintains the status quo of women serving men. In fact, even if the men do get up to clear the table and help load the dishwasher, you should just sit there and let them take care of it. It is your due. For thousands of years women have served men, and the alarm clock of history has at long last rung. </p> <p>The revolution begins in the kitchen! </p> <p><strong> Eat Dessert </strong><br> </p> <p> I have a dream that some day I will have a daughter who will believe she can eat what she wants, when she wants, without worrying about her thighs or her abs or her butt or the saggy, bat-like arms that some women get at middle age. Maybe she won't even know the word cellulite. Is this too much to expect? I think not. But in the meantime women can stubbornly refuse to succumb to the notion that food is the enemy. The fact is that if you eat what you want, when you want it, and exercise three times a week like the experts say you should, you'll be fine. The whole offensive culture of dieting seems invented as yet another way to make women smaller and weaker - to make us become less, literally. The starving self symbolises a diminishing person, and we ought to strive to be more. </p> <p>Even though models must be remarkably thin to mannequin clothes correctly, most of us need not be concerned about how we'll appear on a catwalk or in fashion photographs. We need only worry about how we look in real life, which is not static, and allows our vitality and expressiveness to be part of our gorgeousness. The first step toward becoming this kind of living, breathing beauty is to eat your banana cream pie and cheesecake with great relish, to have your dessert like you believe you deserve it. </p> <p>Men, by the way, find this trait very attractive, in contrast to vomitatious eating disorders, which no one finds appealing. </p> <p><strong> Try to Know What the Kids are Up To </strong><br> </p> <p> Let's face it: you will grow old no matter how much Retin-A you slather on at night, no matter how many alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids there are in your moisturiser, or how many vitamin pills and raw vegetables you eat each day. And you will start to wonder how it is that teenyboppers and their assorted idols seem so much stupider/ louder/more obnoxious than you ever were. You will think that when you were young, you had ideology and hope, but today's kids just have idiocy and despair. Worst of all, they seem to like it like that. You will tell yourself that, somehow, if you really think about it, Duran Duran was meaningful and 'N' Sync is not. You will remember a time when MTV was - yes - subversive. </p> <p>Once you are done being disgusted with their \"music\", you will then be baffled by the aesthetic choices of the younger generation. You will find green hair and eyebrow rings and those bovine nose hooks increasingly repulsive, and wonder why it is that these teenagers want to make themselves look so ugly. Why they can't just wear the belly-baring stretch skirts and layers of black gauze and armfuls of black rubber bracelets like Madonna taught us to do. You will be dumbfounded by the allure of Special K - the horse tranquilliser that gives users a special sense of being trapped in a dark dungeon. </p> <p>In other words, you will be out of it, just like your mother is out of it. You will occasionally pull out Never Mind The Bollocks just to prove to yourself that it was not always thus, that once you were a kid who wanted to destroy passers-by. But essentially, you will not have a clue. Styles come and bands go, and hemlines go up and down; only the generation gap persists. </p> <p>But that does not mean you can't at least know a little bit about Limp Bizkit. I myself must confess that I did not know until recently that Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and Puff Daddy were one and the same; but now I know. You don't have to know who pulled an AK47 on whom. You don't have to see I Know What You Did Last Summer or any Wes Craven movies at all. But you do need to understand why 12-year-old girls are cuckoo about Leonardo DiCaprio. </p> <p>Because as bleak as this stuff looks now, our kids are going to get into death-metal music and snuff movies that will be way worse than anything that is produced today. Outrage only knows how to get more outrageous. </p> <p>But people also tend to outgrow outrage, which is why few rock bands have extensive careers while Merle Haggard and Frank Sinatra go on forever. Does anyone know who Ugly Kid Joe is? And when was the last time you listened to Jane's Addiction? </p> <p>One fine day, you will be sitting in your drawing room, doing needlepoint, watching Wimbledon with the sound off while some peaceful James Taylor, circa 1974, wafts in the background. At the same time, in a room just down the hall, your pubescent son with dirty hair will be banging his head against the wall, to the tune of something very screechy. And at that moment, before you phone up the men in white coats to take him away, it might be worth noting that this is just what the kids do and this too shall pass. </p> <p><strong> Always Keep Your Mind on How You Feel, Not on How He Feels </strong><br> </p> <p> If you are like me, you wander self-consciously through life, wondering what other people are thinking about you, frightened that they are judging you. Since, most likely, all these other people are walking around with the same thoughts, you need not worry what they think about you, because they probably don't. The sooner you realise this, the easier it will be for you to glide through life, unscathed and unconcerned. </p> <p>This preoccupation with what other people think is particularly nefarious when it involves a man. In the beginning of a relationship, you are always walking around with a daisy, plucking at its petals, wondering if he loves you or loves you not. In the meantime, you may very easily lose sight of how you feel about him. </p> <p>Truth is, studying tea leaves, throwing the I-ching, reading the Tarot or talking to a psychic might give you some insight into what is going on - but only into what is going on with you. Barring paranormal powers, you cannot possibly ascertain what he thinks and feels. If he calls and wants to spend time with you, these are pretty good indications that he is at least falling in like with you, but beyond that, things can go any which way. More will be revealed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, every time you find yourself wondering how he feels about you, if he likes you, if he loves you, if he wants you desperately, try instead to start asking yourself how you feel about him. Because that's what really counts. A lot of times, your wondering about his emotions may in fact reflect your own ambivalence: maybe you don't adore him so much. Often we are so eager to be in love and happy that we forget to keep track of what we really think of any one particular guy. Men seem less likely to fall into this trap. </p> <p>For an assortment of biological and sociological reasons - most of which are just plain not fair - men are rarely so eager to get into a relationship that they are willing to overlook some lady's appalling table manners, her affected British accent, and the potently ugly shade of orange eyeshadow that she wears in broad daylight. Women, on the other hand, often seem prepared to believe that Hitler was just an animal-loving vegetarian and ignore the rest. This is a problem. This is how we find our way into relationships that don't work out, but that leave us obsessively self-loathing, wondering, why didn't he like me? Somehow, we forget that he has all the charisma of John Major, that he has all the sex appeal of Boris Yeltsin, that he dances like a white man and that he listens to The Carpenters with no ironic distance. You will, in other words, be obsessed with a man who, by all rights, you should not even like. </p> <p>It is time to stop the insanity. Don't just fall for any old guy who is giving you a hard time on that particular week. In all the time you invest in some loser, you could probably have met 20 people who would make you ready to kick up your heels and jitterbug. </p> <p><strong> Embrace Fanaticism </strong><br> </p> <p> Learn to love things other than boys. Women must learn how to be crazily committed to ideas, theology, interests - anything. We must be positively bonkers about something other than men. Consider this analogy. During the second world war, Winston Churchill spoke of the importance of the government's continued subsidy of the arts, explaining that there was no point sending men out to fight if there was no civilisation worth saving - and worthy of returning home to. Likewise, the point of the sexual revolution was to give women fuller lives; it was not so that we could grimly labour to earn only three-quarters of what men do, and then come home to nothing but housework and screaming children. </p> <p>If women had the kinds of consuming passions that men have - be it watching football or playing golf or drinking with the boys - we would do more to assert our rights than we do by, for instance, filing a complaint with the personnel department when the boss makes some leering comment. </p> <p>\"Be drunken, always. That is the point; nothing else matters,\" wrote Charles Baudelaire, a man who understood too well what it meant to give oneself over to life. \"Drunken with what? With wine, with poetry or with virtue, as you please. But be drunken.\" And women must learn what is meant by these lines, what it means to be besotted with something other than some useless bloke. </p> <p>Unless, of course, that useless bloke is Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, or some other genius with lines, lyrics and chord progressions. Why is it that not only are most musicians male, but even most serious fans are men? At secondary school, girls like the bands that their boyfriends like, and usually not even that much. Perhaps one of the reasons I do so much prefer High Fidelity to Bridget Jones's Diary is that Nick Hornby's Rob, pathetic though he may be - completely commitment-phobic and puerile as a newborn - is still a devoted music fan; he's crazy for something other than his own neuroses. I have always felt my life was saved by rock 'n' roll, and I am baffled about why other women don't tend to have deposited their own desperation into such an obvious receptacle. I understand the lack of a female Jimi Hendrix - it's the loser teenage boy mentality that exacts the necessary masturbatory devotion to guitar practice alone in your room - but why are there not more female Jimi Hendrix fans (not to be confused with groupies, another pre-feminist proposition)? </p> <p>In Fever Pitch, Nick Hornby discusses men's ability to completely immerse themselves in football viewing, admitting that, as a result, \"they become repressed, they fail in their relationships with women, their conversation is trivial and boorish, they find themselves unable to express their emotional needs, they cannot relate to their children, and they die alone and miserable. But, you know, what the hell?\" Somehow, unlike Bridget Jones, Hornby is not afraid of having his carcass half-eaten by an Alsatian. </p> <p>Women who have better things to do than be obsessive stay out of trouble. So just find a way to become fanatical about something, just for fun. Take an interest in horseracing, or read Proust's Remembrance Of Things Past in its entirety, or invest in the stock market, or learn to ski at a late age. It is easy to develop interests - they are called that because they are interesting. </p> <p><strong> The Only Way to Get One Person Off Your Mind is to Get Another One on Your Body </strong><br> </p> <p> Of course, this action could easily backfire, so it is only recommended when you really know what you are doing. This is a situation where ex-boyfriends in good standing can be helpful. But they have to be men you have truly lost interest in. Years ago. You have to pick a man who can still make your heart flutter and your body shiver just a little bit - but not too much. Not enough that you will find yourself - heaven forfend! - wanting to get back together with him the next day. Because if you sleep with one man to get un-obsessed with another man, the last thing you want is two men who give you paroxysms of agony. </p> <p>Your emotional life, in the aftermath of a break-up, will be sufficiently messy that you should only do comforting and nourishing things with yourself. This is a good time for facials and massages, but absolutely no haircuts: women in the throes of heartbreak have been known to enter a salon with long, lovely locks - and to exit it looking like Johnny Rotten, circa 1978. </p> <p>If there is some guy out there who can be of any aid to you in your delicate condition, by all means use him as a resource, exhaust his energy until he has completely sapped yours. Fuck your brains out in the bed you used to share with your boyfriend, and think ha ha ha ha ha the whole time. </p> <p>But know thyself - and, for that matter, kid thyself not. If you feel even sort of like you are about to be inhaled into a situation that might go from bad to weird, do refrain. </p> <p><strong> Do Nothing </strong><br> </p> <p> This is a really hard one. It is hard because it is about cultivating a deep passivity in your emotional life - a tender calm that would probably be very detrimental to other aspects of your existence. So don't start thinking that doing nothing is about whiling away the hours sitting on your settee and eating bonbons. Doing nothing is not the same as being a lazy, useless bum. Doing nothing is about making a conscious decision to not accelerate the drama. It means not booking a flight to Morocco - because good sources have reported that there is no such thing as pain in Marrakesh - when you know you have neither the money nor the time to make this excursion. It means not calling various people in your life to threaten suicide when you know perfectly well that's not what's going to happen. </p> <p>Doing nothing means calmly asking for help when you need it. Doing nothing is opting for the sweetness of stillness. It is about just sitting with your loneliness, making some effort to accept how bad you feel. It is about taking long, contemplative walks through the park, meeting girlfriends for tea and reading silly self-help books. It means checking out the horoscopes in Elle and Vogue and Marie Claire, and comparing them for common and inconsistent predictions. It is about not pursuing histrionics and hysteria, it is about knowing that only time and peace of mind will make things better. </p> <p>And doing nothing is not just something you must try in the case of a broken heart. It is the operative rule with office altercations, screaming fights with your mother and unpleasant tiffs with friends and lovers. If you try to force a resolution to some situation that needs only to be left alone to diffuse, you are only going to worry a wound. In a perfect example of stuffy, sensible and unmistakably British wisdom, Dame Rose Macaulay once noted that, \"It is a common delusion that you can make things better by talking about them.\" </p> <p>So don't pick up the phone so that you can add one last word. Don't go running through the streets late at night, and ring your boyfriend's doorbell with a floral peace offering because you cannot bear the thought that he might never speak to you again. All this activity is simply unnecessary, tiresome and cloyingly manipulative. </p> <p>I feel it is only right for me to confess here that learning to do nothing has pretty much saved my life. I feel a bit hypocritical telling anyone not to get drunk and drugged and disorderly, or not to go too far, because, God knows, at times that has been the story of my life. But it was exhausting and taxing and eventually enough became enough. </p> <p>In the time I have wasted making matters worse, I could have easily raised six children. Without a father. Without even a nanny. So just believe me: don't do something about whatever crazy feelings are boxing in your head until you have first tried to just do nothing. You will be amazed to discover that feelings are not facts, and feelings can be trusted to go away. They always do. </p> <p><strong> Enjoy Your Single Years </strong><br> </p> <p> Do not view the years between school and marriage - and I hope we are talking years and not months, or heaven forbid, days - as one long preamble to real life. Worse still, do not view the years between kindergarten and marriage, between your first Oasis concert and marriage, between losing your virginity and marriage - as life in abeyance. Do not think that the whole point of being single is getting married; men don't think this way, and neither should you. Your single years are not to be traded for the Taj Mahal or the Hope diamond or anything - and do not let your grandmother tell you otherwise. </p> <p>Because, if you marry too young, you will always wonder. Wonder about the boyfriends you will never have and about the singular solo personality that you will never develop, and about the trashy, flashy outfits that you will never get to wear because you are a nice married lady. Even if you are happy with your husband and think he is the greatest thing since bread pudding, you will wonder what you are missing. </p> <p>By the time we are little old ladies, all of us will be living to the ripe old age of 200, settled in colonies on the moon, and living on a steady diet of Ovaltine and Tang. Given this situation, it seems like a good idea to choose wisely when seeking out the man with whom you want to spend a gravity-free old age. These days, until death do you part is a very long time, and despite the prevalence of divorce, I do believe that all of us still wish to wed only once. It is not a bad idea to grow into yourself just a wee bit before you try to blend in with someone else. </p> <p>Now, I know that, after 16, boyfriends and 60 one-night stands, you start to wonder when - or if - it will ever end. But you must endure. Somewhere, in the pile of debris that you will accumulate for the rest of your life, is a point to every misbegotten rendezvous, every bad sexual encounter where some guy mistook your clitoris for an elevator button and you faked an orgasm just to make it end; someday, I promise, you will be able to plot these points on a spreadsheet, and the sensible curve that is your life will become clear, inevitable - you will see all these events for just what they were, and you will know that it could not have happened any other way. </p> <p>Sometimes, after one too many dry-mouthed Sunday mornings with a bad headache, you may start to wish that you had been betrothed at birth to the boy next door. It may start to seem like every man you meet is your last chance. It may seem like every guy you come across is the only person left you haven't already met, that you have not already spent a bad, boring night with. But this isn't true. You are never too old, jaded, wasted and used by the world to once again feel young, dreamy and amazed by life and love once again. You should not give up five minutes before the miracle is about to happen. </p> <p>And besides: you must take your chances. You must even take your chances that you will never find someone to marry. This won't happen, by the way, but you are better off living with that possibility than hiding from life. Because it's fun to be single and to live in a place that belongs to you and only you, that is decorated the way you like, with Oriental rugs that you carried back from Turkey yourself. It's fun to do almost everything by yourself. </p> <p>Certainly, I think it extremely ill-advised either to have children alone or climb Mount Everest on your own - which is why at least the latter is prohibited by Nepalese law. But - like everyone else on this planet who is born alone and will finally die alone - you must cultivate the ability to enjoy your own company. Until you overcome any silly inability to be alone, you should recognise that you are also completely unsuitable for the married life of togetherness. You are not, for thatmatter, suitable for much of anything. </p> <p>In short: Don't even think of getting married until you are quite certain that you've outgrown your little-girl days of being a whiny, needy pain in the ass. </p> <p>Very rarely has anyone's life actually been ruined by the stupid things they have done when they were young and dopey (Princess Diana may be the glaring exception). And really, that is the secret to this whole business of life: you must cultivate the dignity to walk away before they make you run. </p> <p>People who behave in a silly way do not end up with limited lives of no substance - on the contrary: the miserable fate of having nothing ever happen to you is reserved for those who never do anything. So do dumb things and do them with impunity. Spend you nights crying on the bathroom floor, and your icky, incandescent early mornings searching for the last traces of cocaine on the white tile. Sleep with married members of Parliament. Male and female. Look back laughingly on youthful folly. Just so long as you outgrow it. </p> <p><strong> But Do Settle Down </strong><br> </p> <p> Because having a family is a happy thing. After you have swung from the best Waterford crystal chandeliers that someone else's money can buy; after you have been through the combined humiliations of being duped and dumped for your much-less-attractive best friend; after you have travelled through the Balkans with nothing but a schoolgirl knowledge of French to get you between youth hostels; after you have, just once, enjoyed a New Year's Eve when you didn't have a boyfriend and you were not so drunk or high or wired that you were vomiting out the window of some stranger's noisome party, but instead were able to spend a relatively quiet night with a few truly dear friends; after you have done those things, and somewhere between satiation and saturation you have achieved the occasional state of grace, then you are ready to call it quits. Enough is enough. Now it is time to collect your bag of party favours, and move on. You've been single long enough. It's time to settle down. So find some good man and just do it. </p> <p>Just like that. </p> <p>And don't worry: when you are good and ready, the right man will just show up. He just will. Unplanned but entirely expected, like a dandelion growing on the front lawn, there he will be. If I can pass on just one thing, I hope it will be that when you take care of yourself and tend to your garden like Voltaire instructed us, life will do its part to take care of you. </p> <p>And the truth is, when you are ready to settle in and settle down, the hard part will be avoiding your life-partner, the challenge will be the millions of tricks that you will treat yourself to in an effort to thwart this inevitability, to stop true happiness as it greets you. The temptation to run from that which you have always hoped for - particularly if happiness has always been a stranger to you - may well be your predominant impulse in the face of true love. But you are just going to have to get a grip. Don't postpone, deny or derail joy. Because at a certain point you actually will become sufficiently fucked up to get in the way of life's inevitable, happy flow, you really can start doing the kinds of things that will mess you up for good. If you have played out your days as a single girl, and a good person comes along offering you his heart and all you do is skewer it to bits, you are going to start becoming an actually troubled person, as opposed to just an evolving woman who is figuring things out. </p> <p>While the occasional Isaac Newton among us is going to be satisfied by a life under the apple tree without any of the Andrews Sisters or anyone else for company, for most of us the abstract beauties of the world mean little with no one to share them with. The corniness of purple-pink sunsets and the starkness of starry nights and the pristine purity of white, white snow and the hallucinatory pleasure of red, red wine are lonelier than a Roy Orbison song when you are all alone. You've got to give it time but sooner or later, you will be needing to find your special one. </p> <p>There are exceptions to this rule, but I have never met any of them. Most of us need the conventions of coupledom, family and stability to be happy, need to give of ourselves body and soul and heart and spirit to our own true love to know the selfish joy of selflessness. </p> <p>So do not despair of the miserable example of your own childhood and choose not to have a family of your own. Do not be denied by fear. No matter how much shit was visited upon you when you were young - so much bad that it occasionally seems like the best you will ever manage to do is hate so much that it hurts - I still believe we all ought to take the chance, the huge and potentially devastating chance, that we will be rewarded by loving that much. As was pointed out by Albert Einstein himself: \"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" If you correct your past with good choices made in the present, then when all these different time zones smash together, they will turn into a happy future. </p> <p>Clearly, the family structures that we were born into were less than ideal, or they would not have resulted in a 50% failure rate. It is now up to us to make and model our own family moulds. It does not have to be like our parents were. It does not have to be the way it ever was. A family is whatever works. </p> <p>I think of the opening scene of Wim Wenders' 1987 film Wings Of Desire, when the angel lands on earth and peers into all the different windows in Berlin buildings, and at all the solitary lives that go on in each apartment, all these people living as close together as neighbours in urban centres do, with women crying and men yelling, and everybody so all alone. Here are all these people, in such close physical proximity, each one of them desperate and in need of an angel to save his heart or her soul from this desolation, and yet none of them can know or help each other. None of them can reach through the walls to touch anyone else's loneliness, and so the angel watches all of them through the glass panes of their lives, and he is horrified by the alienation he sees. And just like in the movie, all over the world there are people torn apart before they have even had a chance to be together, and there are people who are just dying of loneliness. Fortunately, you are not going to be one of them. </p> <p>\u00a9 Elizabeth Wurtzel, 2000 </p> <p>This is an edited extract from The Bitch Rules, by Elizabeth Wurtzel, published by Quartet on May 8, at \u00a36</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am not the happiest person. In fact, in the battle between joy and misery, I'd say that the latter often seems to prevail. But I do have one thing on my side: I have enormous faith. And hope. I am not speaking of the kind you find in church or in the afterlife, I am speaking of a simple faith that says that one way or another, no matter how many times I stumble and stub my big toe, somehow life is going to work itself out. Being human, we all kind of want the same things, to love and be loved, and all that. And in the rules I've laid out here, I believe I have found the secret of life. Don't Clear the Table at a Dinner Party Unless the Men Get Up to Help, Too You know how it is. Friends are trying to be domestic and act grown up by having a bunch of people over for a meal. Invariably, the risotto will be too sticky, the salmon overcooked, the dill sauce too salty - but the effort will, of course, be the whole point. You will feel, momentarily, as mature as your parents were at your age. And to be appreciative and well mannered, between courses and at the end of the meal, you and others will get up to clear the table and help wash the dishes. Now, as it happens, I have it from those who know about etiquette, that when you are a guest at somebody else's table, you need not offer to help, in fact you should let your hosts attend to all the post-repast cleaning. But because these good manners were formulated with butlers and maids figured in, it is probably acceptable and desirable to help with the clean-up effort. But not if the men don't. Clean-up tasks should not be gendered. Do you want to know how you can change the whole world, one dinner table at a time? By holding a sit-in! By refusing to be helpful unless the men are! Stay in your chair, savour a few more sips of your wine, finish the last spoons of your melting orange-kumquat sorbet, and refuse to participate in a process that maintains the status quo of women serving men. In fact, even if the men do get up to clear the table and help load the dishwasher, you should just sit there and let them take care of it. It is your due. For thousands of years women have served men, and the alarm clock of history has at long last rung. The revolution begins in the kitchen! Eat Dessert I have a dream that some day I will have a daughter who will believe she can eat what she wants, when she wants, without worrying about her thighs or her abs or her butt or the saggy, bat-like arms that some women get at middle age. Maybe she won't even know the word cellulite. Is this too much to expect? I think not. But in the meantime women can stubbornly refuse to succumb to the notion that food is the enemy. The fact is that if you eat what you want, when you want it, and exercise three times a week like the experts say you should, you'll be fine. The whole offensive culture of dieting seems invented as yet another way to make women smaller and weaker - to make us become less, literally. The starving self symbolises a diminishing person, and we ought to strive to be more. Even though models must be remarkably thin to mannequin clothes correctly, most of us need not be concerned about how we'll appear on a catwalk or in fashion photographs. We need only worry about how we look in real life, which is not static, and allows our vitality and expressiveness to be part of our gorgeousness. The first step toward becoming this kind of living, breathing beauty is to eat your banana cream pie and cheesecake with great relish, to have your dessert like you believe you deserve it. Men, by the way, find this trait very attractive, in contrast to vomitatious eating disorders, which no one finds appealing. Try to Know What the Kids are Up To Let's face it: you will grow old no matter how much Retin-A you slather on at night, no matter how many alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids there are in your moisturiser, or how many vitamin pills and raw vegetables you eat each day. And you will start to wonder how it is that teenyboppers and their assorted idols seem so much stupider/ louder/more obnoxious than you ever were. You will think that when you were young, you had ideology and hope, but today's kids just have idiocy and despair. Worst of all, they seem to like it like that. You will tell yourself that, somehow, if you really think about it, Duran Duran was meaningful and 'N' Sync is not. You will remember a time when MTV was - yes - subversive. Once you are done being disgusted with their \"music\", you will then be baffled by the aesthetic choices of the younger generation. You will find green hair and eyebrow rings and those bovine nose hooks increasingly repulsive, and wonder why it is that these teenagers want to make themselves look so ugly. Why they can't just wear the belly-baring stretch skirts and layers of black gauze and armfuls of black rubber bracelets like Madonna taught us to do. You will be dumbfounded by the allure of Special K - the horse tranquilliser that gives users a special sense of being trapped in a dark dungeon. In other words, you will be out of it, just like your mother is out of it. You will occasionally pull out Never Mind The Bollocks just to prove to yourself that it was not always thus, that once you were a kid who wanted to destroy passers-by. But essentially, you will not have a clue. Styles come and bands go, and hemlines go up and down; only the generation gap persists. But that does not mean you can't at least know a little bit about Limp Bizkit. I myself must confess that I did not know until recently that Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and Puff Daddy were one and the same; but now I know. You don't have to know who pulled an AK47 on whom. You don't have to see I Know What You Did Last Summer or any Wes Craven movies at all. But you do need to understand why 12-year-old girls are cuckoo about Leonardo DiCaprio. Because as bleak as this stuff looks now, our kids are going to get into death-metal music and snuff movies that will be way worse than anything that is produced today. Outrage only knows how to get more outrageous. But people also tend to outgrow outrage, which is why few rock bands have extensive careers while Merle Haggard and Frank Sinatra go on forever. Does anyone know who Ugly Kid Joe is? And when was the last time you listened to Jane's Addiction? One fine day, you will be sitting in your drawing room, doing needlepoint, watching Wimbledon with the sound off while some peaceful James Taylor, circa 1974, wafts in the background. At the same time, in a room just down the hall, your pubescent son with dirty hair will be banging his head against the wall, to the tune of something very screechy. And at that moment, before you phone up the men in white coats to take him away, it might be worth noting that this is just what the kids do and this too shall pass. Always Keep Your Mind on How You Feel, Not on How He Feels If you are like me, you wander self-consciously through life, wondering what other people are thinking about you, frightened that they are judging you. Since, most likely, all these other people are walking around with the same thoughts, you need not worry what they think about you, because they probably don't. The sooner you realise this, the easier it will be for you to glide through life, unscathed and unconcerned. This preoccupation with what other people think is particularly nefarious when it involves a man. In the beginning of a relationship, you are always walking around with a daisy, plucking at its petals, wondering if he loves you or loves you not. In the meantime, you may very easily lose sight of how you feel about him. Truth is, studying tea leaves, throwing the I-ching, reading the Tarot or talking to a psychic might give you some insight into what is going on - but only into what is going on with you. Barring paranormal powers, you cannot possibly ascertain what he thinks and feels. If he calls and wants to spend time with you, these are pretty good indications that he is at least falling in like with you, but beyond that, things can go any which way. More will be revealed. Meanwhile, every time you find yourself wondering how he feels about you, if he likes you, if he loves you, if he wants you desperately, try instead to start asking yourself how you feel about him. Because that's what really counts. A lot of times, your wondering about his emotions may in fact reflect your own ambivalence: maybe you don't adore him so much. Often we are so eager to be in love and happy that we forget to keep track of what we really think of any one particular guy. Men seem less likely to fall into this trap. For an assortment of biological and sociological reasons - most of which are just plain not fair - men are rarely so eager to get into a relationship that they are willing to overlook some lady's appalling table manners, her affected British accent, and the potently ugly shade of orange eyeshadow that she wears in broad daylight. Women, on the other hand, often seem prepared to believe that Hitler was just an animal-loving vegetarian and ignore the rest. This is a problem. This is how we find our way into relationships that don't work out, but that leave us obsessively self-loathing, wondering, why didn't he like me? Somehow, we forget that he has all the charisma of John Major, that he has all the sex appeal of Boris Yeltsin, that he dances like a white man and that he listens to The Carpenters with no ironic distance. You will, in other words, be obsessed with a man who, by all rights, you should not even like. It is time to stop the insanity. Don't just fall for any old guy who is giving you a hard time on that particular week. In all the time you invest in some loser, you could probably have met 20 people who would make you ready to kick up your heels and jitterbug. Embrace Fanaticism Learn to love things other than boys. Women must learn how to be crazily committed to ideas, theology, interests - anything. We must be positively bonkers about something other than men. Consider this analogy. During the second world war, Winston Churchill spoke of the importance of the government's continued subsidy of the arts, explaining that there was no point sending men out to fight if there was no civilisation worth saving - and worthy of returning home to. Likewise, the point of the sexual revolution was to give women fuller lives; it was not so that we could grimly labour to earn only three-quarters of what men do, and then come home to nothing but housework and screaming children. If women had the kinds of consuming passions that men have - be it watching football or playing golf or drinking with the boys - we would do more to assert our rights than we do by, for instance, filing a complaint with the personnel department when the boss makes some leering comment. \"Be drunken, always. That is the point; nothing else matters,\" wrote Charles Baudelaire, a man who understood too well what it meant to give oneself over to life. \"Drunken with what? With wine, with poetry or with virtue, as you please. But be drunken.\" And women must learn what is meant by these lines, what it means to be besotted with something other than some useless bloke. Unless, of course, that useless bloke is Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, or some other genius with lines, lyrics and chord progressions. Why is it that not only are most musicians male, but even most serious fans are men? At secondary school, girls like the bands that their boyfriends like, and usually not even that much. Perhaps one of the reasons I do so much prefer High Fidelity to Bridget Jones's Diary is that Nick Hornby's Rob, pathetic though he may be - completely commitment-phobic and puerile as a newborn - is still a devoted music fan; he's crazy for something other than his own neuroses. I have always felt my life was saved by rock 'n' roll, and I am baffled about why other women don't tend to have deposited their own desperation into such an obvious receptacle. I understand the lack of a female Jimi Hendrix - it's the loser teenage boy mentality that exacts the necessary masturbatory devotion to guitar practice alone in your room - but why are there not more female Jimi Hendrix fans (not to be confused with groupies, another pre-feminist proposition)? In Fever Pitch, Nick Hornby discusses men's ability to completely immerse themselves in football viewing, admitting that, as a result, \"they become repressed, they fail in their relationships with women, their conversation is trivial and boorish, they find themselves unable to express their emotional needs, they cannot relate to their children, and they die alone and miserable. But, you know, what the hell?\" Somehow, unlike Bridget Jones, Hornby is not afraid of having his carcass half-eaten by an Alsatian. Women who have better things to do than be obsessive stay out of trouble. So just find a way to become fanatical about something, just for fun. Take an interest in horseracing, or read Proust's Remembrance Of Things Past in its entirety, or invest in the stock market, or learn to ski at a late age. It is easy to develop interests - they are called that because they are interesting. The Only Way to Get One Person Off Your Mind is to Get Another One on Your Body Of course, this action could easily backfire, so it is only recommended when you really know what you are doing. This is a situation where ex-boyfriends in good standing can be helpful. But they have to be men you have truly lost interest in. Years ago. You have to pick a man who can still make your heart flutter and your body shiver just a little bit - but not too much. Not enough that you will find yourself - heaven forfend! - wanting to get back together with him the next day. Because if you sleep with one man to get un-obsessed with another man, the last thing you want is two men who give you paroxysms of agony. Your emotional life, in the aftermath of a break-up, will be sufficiently messy that you should only do comforting and nourishing things with yourself. This is a good time for facials and massages, but absolutely no haircuts: women in the throes of heartbreak have been known to enter a salon with long, lovely locks - and to exit it looking like Johnny Rotten, circa 1978. If there is some guy out there who can be of any aid to you in your delicate condition, by all means use him as a resource, exhaust his energy until he has completely sapped yours. Fuck your brains out in the bed you used to share with your boyfriend, and think ha ha ha ha ha the whole time. But know thyself - and, for that matter, kid thyself not. If you feel even sort of like you are about to be inhaled into a situation that might go from bad to weird, do refrain. Do Nothing This is a really hard one. It is hard because it is about cultivating a deep passivity in your emotional life - a tender calm that would probably be very detrimental to other aspects of your existence. So don't start thinking that doing nothing is about whiling away the hours sitting on your settee and eating bonbons. Doing nothing is not the same as being a lazy, useless bum. Doing nothing is about making a conscious decision to not accelerate the drama. It means not booking a flight to Morocco - because good sources have reported that there is no such thing as pain in Marrakesh - when you know you have neither the money nor the time to make this excursion. It means not calling various people in your life to threaten suicide when you know perfectly well that's not what's going to happen. Doing nothing means calmly asking for help when you need it. Doing nothing is opting for the sweetness of stillness. It is about just sitting with your loneliness, making some effort to accept how bad you feel. It is about taking long, contemplative walks through the park, meeting girlfriends for tea and reading silly self-help books. It means checking out the horoscopes in Elle and Vogue and Marie Claire, and comparing them for common and inconsistent predictions. It is about not pursuing histrionics and hysteria, it is about knowing that only time and peace of mind will make things better. And doing nothing is not just something you must try in the case of a broken heart. It is the operative rule with office altercations, screaming fights with your mother and unpleasant tiffs with friends and lovers. If you try to force a resolution to some situation that needs only to be left alone to diffuse, you are only going to worry a wound. In a perfect example of stuffy, sensible and unmistakably British wisdom, Dame Rose Macaulay once noted that, \"It is a common delusion that you can make things better by talking about them.\" So don't pick up the phone so that you can add one last word. Don't go running through the streets late at night, and ring your boyfriend's doorbell with a floral peace offering because you cannot bear the thought that he might never speak to you again. All this activity is simply unnecessary, tiresome and cloyingly manipulative. I feel it is only right for me to confess here that learning to do nothing has pretty much saved my life. I feel a bit hypocritical telling anyone not to get drunk and drugged and disorderly, or not to go too far, because, God knows, at times that has been the story of my life. But it was exhausting and taxing and eventually enough became enough. In the time I have wasted making matters worse, I could have easily raised six children. Without a father. Without even a nanny. So just believe me: don't do something about whatever crazy feelings are boxing in your head until you have first tried to just do nothing. You will be amazed to discover that feelings are not facts, and feelings can be trusted to go away. They always do. Enjoy Your Single Years Do not view the years between school and marriage - and I hope we are talking years and not months, or heaven forbid, days - as one long preamble to real life. Worse still, do not view the years between kindergarten and marriage, between your first Oasis concert and marriage, between losing your virginity and marriage - as life in abeyance. Do not think that the whole point of being single is getting married; men don't think this way, and neither should you. Your single years are not to be traded for the Taj Mahal or the Hope diamond or anything - and do not let your grandmother tell you otherwise. Because, if you marry too young, you will always wonder. Wonder about the boyfriends you will never have and about the singular solo personality that you will never develop, and about the trashy, flashy outfits that you will never get to wear because you are a nice married lady. Even if you are happy with your husband and think he is the greatest thing since bread pudding, you will wonder what you are missing. By the time we are little old ladies, all of us will be living to the ripe old age of 200, settled in colonies on the moon, and living on a steady diet of Ovaltine and Tang. Given this situation, it seems like a good idea to choose wisely when seeking out the man with whom you want to spend a gravity-free old age. These days, until death do you part is a very long time, and despite the prevalence of divorce, I do believe that all of us still wish to wed only once. It is not a bad idea to grow into yourself just a wee bit before you try to blend in with someone else. Now, I know that, after 16, boyfriends and 60 one-night stands, you start to wonder when - or if - it will ever end. But you must endure. Somewhere, in the pile of debris that you will accumulate for the rest of your life, is a point to every misbegotten rendezvous, every bad sexual encounter where some guy mistook your clitoris for an elevator button and you faked an orgasm just to make it end; someday, I promise, you will be able to plot these points on a spreadsheet, and the sensible curve that is your life will become clear, inevitable - you will see all these events for just what they were, and you will know that it could not have happened any other way. Sometimes, after one too many dry-mouthed Sunday mornings with a bad headache, you may start to wish that you had been betrothed at birth to the boy next door. It may start to seem like every man you meet is your last chance. It may seem like every guy you come across is the only person left you haven't already met, that you have not already spent a bad, boring night with. But this isn't true. You are never too old, jaded, wasted and used by the world to once again feel young, dreamy and amazed by life and love once again. You should not give up five minutes before the miracle is about to happen. And besides: you must take your chances. You must even take your chances that you will never find someone to marry. This won't happen, by the way, but you are better off living with that possibility than hiding from life. Because it's fun to be single and to live in a place that belongs to you and only you, that is decorated the way you like, with Oriental rugs that you carried back from Turkey yourself. It's fun to do almost everything by yourself. Certainly, I think it extremely ill-advised either to have children alone or climb Mount Everest on your own - which is why at least the latter is prohibited by Nepalese law. But - like everyone else on this planet who is born alone and will finally die alone - you must cultivate the ability to enjoy your own company. Until you overcome any silly inability to be alone, you should recognise that you are also completely unsuitable for the married life of togetherness. You are not, for thatmatter, suitable for much of anything. In short: Don't even think of getting married until you are quite certain that you've outgrown your little-girl days of being a whiny, needy pain in the ass. Very rarely has anyone's life actually been ruined by the stupid things they have done when they were young and dopey (Princess Diana may be the glaring exception). And really, that is the secret to this whole business of life: you must cultivate the dignity to walk away before they make you run. People who behave in a silly way do not end up with limited lives of no substance - on the contrary: the miserable fate of having nothing ever happen to you is reserved for those who never do anything. So do dumb things and do them with impunity. Spend you nights crying on the bathroom floor, and your icky, incandescent early mornings searching for the last traces of cocaine on the white tile. Sleep with married members of Parliament. Male and female. Look back laughingly on youthful folly. Just so long as you outgrow it. But Do Settle Down Because having a family is a happy thing. After you have swung from the best Waterford crystal chandeliers that someone else's money can buy; after you have been through the combined humiliations of being duped and dumped for your much-less-attractive best friend; after you have travelled through the Balkans with nothing but a schoolgirl knowledge of French to get you between youth hostels; after you have, just once, enjoyed a New Year's Eve when you didn't have a boyfriend and you were not so drunk or high or wired that you were vomiting out the window of some stranger's noisome party, but instead were able to spend a relatively quiet night with a few truly dear friends; after you have done those things, and somewhere between satiation and saturation you have achieved the occasional state of grace, then you are ready to call it quits. Enough is enough. Now it is time to collect your bag of party favours, and move on. You've been single long enough. It's time to settle down. So find some good man and just do it. Just like that. And don't worry: when you are good and ready, the right man will just show up. He just will. Unplanned but entirely expected, like a dandelion growing on the front lawn, there he will be. If I can pass on just one thing, I hope it will be that when you take care of yourself and tend to your garden like Voltaire instructed us, life will do its part to take care of you. And the truth is, when you are ready to settle in and settle down, the hard part will be avoiding your life-partner, the challenge will be the millions of tricks that you will treat yourself to in an effort to thwart this inevitability, to stop true happiness as it greets you. The temptation to run from that which you have always hoped for - particularly if happiness has always been a stranger to you - may well be your predominant impulse in the face of true love. But you are just going to have to get a grip. Don't postpone, deny or derail joy. Because at a certain point you actually will become sufficiently fucked up to get in the way of life's inevitable, happy flow, you really can start doing the kinds of things that will mess you up for good. If you have played out your days as a single girl, and a good person comes along offering you his heart and all you do is skewer it to bits, you are going to start becoming an actually troubled person, as opposed to just an evolving woman who is figuring things out. While the occasional Isaac Newton among us is going to be satisfied by a life under the apple tree without any of the Andrews Sisters or anyone else for company, for most of us the abstract beauties of the world mean little with no one to share them with. The corniness of purple-pink sunsets and the starkness of starry nights and the pristine purity of white, white snow and the hallucinatory pleasure of red, red wine are lonelier than a Roy Orbison song when you are all alone. You've got to give it time but sooner or later, you will be needing to find your special one. There are exceptions to this rule, but I have never met any of them. Most of us need the conventions of coupledom, family and stability to be happy, need to give of ourselves body and soul and heart and spirit to our own true love to know the selfish joy of selflessness. So do not despair of the miserable example of your own childhood and choose not to have a family of your own. Do not be denied by fear. No matter how much shit was visited upon you when you were young - so much bad that it occasionally seems like the best you will ever manage to do is hate so much that it hurts - I still believe we all ought to take the chance, the huge and potentially devastating chance, that we will be rewarded by loving that much. As was pointed out by Albert Einstein himself: \"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" If you correct your past with good choices made in the present, then when all these different time zones smash together, they will turn into a happy future. Clearly, the family structures that we were born into were less than ideal, or they would not have resulted in a 50% failure rate. It is now up to us to make and model our own family moulds. It does not have to be like our parents were. It does not have to be the way it ever was. A family is whatever works. I think of the opening scene of Wim Wenders' 1987 film Wings Of Desire, when the angel lands on earth and peers into all the different windows in Berlin buildings, and at all the solitary lives that go on in each apartment, all these people living as close together as neighbours in urban centres do, with women crying and men yelling, and everybody so all alone. Here are all these people, in such close physical proximity, each one of them desperate and in need of an angel to save his heart or her soul from this desolation, and yet none of them can know or help each other. None of them can reach through the walls to touch anyone else's loneliness, and so the angel watches all of them through the glass panes of their lives, and he is horrified by the alienation he sees. And just like in the movie, all over the world there are people torn apart before they have even had a chance to be together, and there are people who are just dying of loneliness. Fortunately, you are not going to be one of them. \u00a9 Elizabeth Wurtzel, 2000 This is an edited extract from The Bitch Rules, by Elizabeth Wurtzel, published by Quartet on May 8, at \u00a36",

Although the idea that one might read texts attentively and analytically is out of favour in some English departments these days, it was for several decades an orthodoxy. Even as a student, Empson had stressed his desire to bring to criticism \"all possible attitudes, to turn upon a given situation every tool, however irrelevant or disconnected, of the contemporary mind\". This attempt to synthesise, or at least aggregate, the various disciplines of contemporary thought can also be found in his poetry. </p> <p>The critic whose Cambridge career was cut short by condoms went on to a brilliant academic career in Japan, China, and England. But the poet - whose early work was admired by Wittgenstein and the Bloomsbury group and seemed to occupy a space between TS Eliot's trail-blazing modernism and the political poetry of the Auden-MacNeice gang - did not write very much after the war; although he did not die until 1984, the poetry had basically finished by 1949. Empson's poetic output occupies about 100 pages. John Haffenden's excellent edition of the Complete Poems weighs in at around 500 pages, and the apparatus is not wasteful; indeed, it goes some way towards explaining why Empson stopped writing. </p> <p>One of the most interesting things about this volume is the discovery that Empson's cerebral-looking pieces sprang from quite heartfelt emotions; he describes many of his earliest poems as \"boy afraid of girl\", and indeed they resemble Donne's work in their apparently incongruous accumulation of analogy and argument to deal with human relationship. Another shock is that some of the more famous and best-loved poems were not rated highly by Empson himself. It is odd to find him surprised by the success of, say, \"Let it Go\", a short and brilliant piece that one can quote in full: </p> <p> \"It is this deep blankness is the real thing strange.</p> <p>The more things happen to you, the more you can't </p> <p>tell or remember even what they were. </p> <p>The contradictions cover such a range. </p> <p>The talk would talk and go so far aslant. </p> <p>You don't want madhouse and the whole thing there.\" </p> <p>I had always taken this piece, by far his most direct, as a comment on the impossibility of encompassing everything at once: flooded by information, layered with analysis and the analysis of analysis (\"the talk would talk\"), one would go mad in the attempt. Martin Amis's Success intelligently alludes to the poem in a remark addressed to a schizophrenic; schizophrenia is in some ways about the breaking-down of our filtering mechanisms, being overwhelmed by sensory data. But Empson's comments on this \"hopelessly bad\" poem consistently assert that it is about \"stopping writing\". Perhaps, despite his brilliance as a critic, he was not the best interpreter or judge of his own work. </p> <p>His poetry, it has to be said, is unusually difficult at first approach. It is densely allusive, not merely to other poetry but to the scientific knowledge of various periods and cultures. The syntax and the grammar are quirky, often condensed, frequently deliberately ambiguous.

Taken with the other comments Haffenden has collected, they give the unmistakable impression of a man baffled by his failure to communicate what he meant, despite his zeal in finding so many fertile meanings in other writers' poems. </p> <p>Even today there is an unease about poems that come with their own notes. Eliot did it with The Waste Land, of course, though he suggested later (whether truthfully or not) that he had had to supply the bogus scholarship simply to bulk the poem out to book-length.

As Haffenden says of a line in \"Advice\", \"we have to rely on WE's note to communicate to us (as the poem fails to do) that these terms refer to the course of syphilis infection\". He then gently suggests that Empson hadn't correctly understood the symptoms of tertiary syphilis anyway.</p> <p>For the most part, though, the notes are engaging, good-humoured and helpful; and they stem less from snobbery than from a recognition that it is not reasonable to expect your readers to have covered exactly the same ground as you.

By those standards, Haffenden has done Empson proud; he offers an entertaining biographical introduction, discusses the texts and Empson's views on notes, gives us a timeline and scrupulously traces the allusions and references in the poems that Empson did not spell out himself. Given Empson's wide and eclectic reading, this is a formidable labour of scholarship; but rather than reducing the poet to unrevivable dryness, Haffenden brings him to life, showing us his personality, his foibles, his endearing modesties and concerns.

His life seems more promising than the one described in the first Socrates Fortlow novel, Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned. But every day some crime happens in his neighbourhood and the cops try to nail him for it (they even try to serve him for not having a licence for Killer, which seems harsh); every day some young Thrasymachus ill-advisedly thrusts himself into Socrates' face; every day unimpressive white people rub him up the wrong way. </p> <p>Like his Greek predecessor, Socrates is out of joint with this world, though his critical stance is less academic: \"The policeman, the salesman in the store, the newspaperman or the TV anchor, Socrates didn't trust any one of them.

Will being promoted to store manager in the supermarket really do him any favours or will it lose him freedom? He asks not only what the good life is, but whether it is possible for the likes of him. Can this once bad man become good? Walkin' the Dog is about insisting on one's own moral character in tough circumstances. </p> <p>Mosley's prose here seems affectless, the book apparently devoid of a plot. The 12 chapters could be read as short stories, each one with a Socratic question at its core. The novel nonetheless has a momentum that creeps up like a two-legged mutt, unprepossessing at first, seemingly dopey and a bit simple, but ultimately very powerful. Only a histrionic LA riot - unwittingly sparked when Socrates protests against a corrupt, racist policeman - strikes the wrong note. </p> <p>Appealingly, though, by the end love turns out not to be a weakness in Fortlow's difficult world, but a responsibility. For a white biped of an Englishman, being dragged around on Socrates Fortlow's chain turns out to be unexpectedly rewarding.</p>",

Can this once bad man become good? Walkin' the Dog is about insisting on one's own moral character in tough circumstances. Mosley's prose here seems affectless, the book apparently devoid of a plot. The 12 chapters could be read as short stories, each one with a Socratic question at its core. The novel nonetheless has a momentum that creeps up like a two-legged mutt, unprepossessing at first, seemingly dopey and a bit simple, but ultimately very powerful. Only a histrionic LA riot - unwittingly sparked when Socrates protests against a corrupt, racist policeman - strikes the wrong note. Appealingly, though, by the end love turns out not to be a weakness in Fortlow's difficult world, but a responsibility. For a white biped of an Englishman, being dragged around on Socrates Fortlow's chain turns out to be unexpectedly rewarding.",

It's just that, in the end, Anil has more than one ghost to contend with. </p> <p>Anil Tissera, 33 years old, is the orphaned daughter of a respected Sri Lankan doctor who returns to her homeland in the early 1990s under the auspices of the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva. A strong-willed forensic specialist fresh from the killing fields of Guatemala, she has lived in Europe and North America for 15 years; part of her journey here is a rediscovery of lost places and \"buried senses from childhood\". But the country of her youth is now ravaged by civil war, a nation of hidden enmities and brutal disappearances, mutilated corpses killed by unknown murderers for unknown reasons. </p> <p>Anil finds herself paired in her work with a reticent archaeologist in his late 40s called Sarath Diyasena, a man of whom she observes that \"most of what [he] wished to know was in some way linked to the earth. She suspected he found the social world around him irrelevant\". He, meanwhile, is as nonplussed by their partnership as the reader is: \"A forensic pathologist, an archaeologist, odd pairing, if you want my opinion.\" </p> <p>Troublingly serendipitous, it constitutes the moment in the novel at which the reader must take a leap of literary faith. Ondaatje demanded a similar leap in The English Patient - after all, did the gathering of his characters in the Villa San Girolamo not seem a trifle too convenient? Yet it is impossible not to forgive his God-like manipulations of coincidence. Anil and Sarath must be united in order that Sarath's study of ancient bones from \"a sacred grave for monks\" near Bandarawela may yield fragments of a contemporary skeleton that will pique Anil's forensic interest. The grave site is in a restricted zone to which only government employees have access; the recent skeleton they find, therefore, has been dumped there by some official employee and is, logically, the victim of a government killing. </p> <p>It becomes imperative to Anil to identify this skeleton. This will prove, publicly and for the first time, that the government has been involved in the rampage of killings across the island. Sarath, throughout, remains less certain of their enterprise: \"There were dangers in handing truth to an unsafe city around you. As an archaeologist, Sarath believed in truth as a principle. That is, he would have given his life for the truth if the truth were of any use.\" </p> <p>The first half of the novel, then, weaves its strands in the manner of a deft literary thriller, as Anil and Sarath - whose unity of purpose remains always in question - pursue the identity of the skeleton from Bandarawela. They name it Sailor and sequester it in their laboratory on a disused passenger liner berthed in an unused quay at the north end of Colombo harbour. Tantalising questions about Sarath arise (and remain): is his wife alive or dead? What is the role of his cousin in the government? Where does he go when he disappears for days at a time? Above all, can Anil trust him? But then again, what choice does she have? </p> <p>It is Sarath who leads her to his former teacher, a now-blind epigraphist called Palipana who \"made his name translating Pali scripts and recording and translating the rock graffiti of Sigiriya\". His more recent scholarship, apparently falsified, has led to his ostracisation and he has retreated, hermit-like, to a remote and abandoned forest monastery where he is cared for by his niece. He in turn sends them to find an artificer, a man who paints the eyes on statues of the Buddha in accordance with ancient ritual. The man he recommends, Ananda Udugama, has been reduced to working in the gem mines and is now a hopeless drunk; but it is he alone, Palipana insists, who will be able to reconstruct a human head from Sailor's skull. </p> <p>Ananda is duly found, and the trio - Sarath, Anil and Ananda - retreat with the skeleton to \"a walawwa in Ekneligoda, the house belonging to a family named Wickramasinghe, who had lived in it for five generations\". Now, however, the house is abandoned and in questionable repair; there is mysterious writing on the walls. It is this section of the book - in which Sarath, Anil and Ananda hover around Sailor the way Hana, Caravaggio and Kip hovered around the burned husk of a man - that most powerfully echoes The English Patient. In both instances the sputtering war drawing to a close in the world outside becomes something more personal within the odd, artificial community of these isolated characters. </p> <p>It is also by this point that the novel has ceased to resemble a thriller, and gives rein instead to its more oblique and subtle explorations. Although Sailor will, against all odds, be identified, that identification comes to seem almost irrelevant. (Which is not to say that this identification will not have consequences, and serious ones.)</p> <p>We are instead embroiled in the delicate and agonising histories of the maimed men who surround Anil: Ananda, who has lost his wife and seeks to die; Sarath, who has lost his also and may, indeed, share Ananda's impulse; and Sarath's strange, fierce younger brother Gamini, a doctor in the emergency services whose isolation in the madness of war is all but complete. Strung out on speed, barely sleeping or eating, his marriage long over and his relationship with his brother tense at best, Gamini is so fully in the arms of the dead and dying that he is all but untouchable. And yet it is with him rather than with his brother that Anil forges a bond; and it is he who will prove war's true survivor. </p> <p>What is most striking about Ondaatje's vision in Anil's Ghost is its terrible isolation. No man or woman lives in community: all are depicted as fully and fundamentally alone, sealed off from their fellows no matter how they try to transcend the barriers between them. Often, indeed, they take pleasure in those very barriers.</p> <p>Anil's former lover and her best friend in the United States are both lost to her; Sarath and Gamini are brothers, but cannot share their hearts. The small grouping around Sailor, in which all are together and yet so alone, is emblematic of this inescapable solitude. It would seem that human relations are always an incomprehensible war, whether in the pampered comfort of North America or the unsettled brutality of war-torn Sri Lanka. It is only Palinapa, the blind near-prophet alone in the wilderness, who seems close to finding peace in this novel; and that only because he has renounced the world. </p> <p>This powerful sense of isolation is reinforced, too, by Ondaatje's particular literary form. In the glory of his images and inventiveness of his prose, he is ultimately a lyric writer. Impatient with the banalities of scene-setting, he writes in fragmented tableaux: static, isolated moments from which a sense of continuity is only implied. There is much to astonish, to disturb and to admire in this dense book, which demands the reader's fullest engagement. Ondaatje's ability to create deeply moving fictions through indirection is a rare triumph: a poet in the skin of a novelist, he makes the mysteries of silence speak with the force of his words.</p>",

South African publisher Covos Day (UK distributors Verulam Publishing, 01727 872 770) publishes a variety of Rhodesian memoirs. Many of the others are by anti-insurgent soldiers and policemen.",

      "body": "<p>The crime writer Michael Dibdin is an unlikely adornment to the Irish literary tradition. He was born in Wolverhampton, lives in Seattle and made his name writing about a detective in Italy. But his formative years were spent in 1950s and 1960s Lisburn in Northern Ireland, where he received an early crash course in narrative skills. \"Most people then didn't have televisions, and pubs didn't even have jukeboxes. So people would talk and tell stories and try to top the last story with a better one. If your story was no good you would find out real fast. It was a great education.\" </p> <p>This was a time before Northern Ireland become interesting, he says. \"As far as I was concerned I grew up in a rather boring provincial town. So I read everything that came my way: classics, modern novels, non-fiction, poetry, plays. I just gobbled it all down.\" </p> <p>As for crime fiction, the decisive discovery was \"the inevitable Conan Doyle\". Dibdin was given a 1930s set of Sherlock Holmes stories owned by his grandfather when he was 14. \"It's the absolute best age to read to them,\" he says. \"I believed it all, and for months I lay trembling in bed at the thought that murderous Mormons would come into the room and write 'Two more days to go' on the wall in blood or something.\" </p> <p>His grounding in the minutiae of Baker Street ultimately fed into his first novel, The Last Sherlock Holmes Story, in which Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper case. Its publication in 1978 was a good news/bad news story, according to Dibdin. \"Much to my amazement and delight it was published by Jonathan Cape,\" he explains. \"But then it sold 13-and-a-half copies, and the only interest people had in anything else I might do was a sequel. I didn't want to spend my life writing Sherlock Holmes pastiches. But on the other hand I didn't know what else to do.\" </p> <p>He ended up teaching English in Italy, where eight years later he did write another Victorian pastiche, this time about the Brownings in Florence. \"The low point in my career was when I moved back to England after the five years in Italy and my American publisher turned the book down. I really thought 'That's it, my career has hit a reef.' But guess what? It has just been published in America and has sold 35,000 copies. I just knew it would do well! But would anyone believe me?\" </p> <p>Dibdin then wrote Ratking, the first outing for Italian detective Aurelio Zen, although at that stage there was no inkling that he would feature in another six books. \"To be perfectly frank, I was so depressed about my career, I wasn't presumptuous enough to think that it could become anything like a series.\" Ratking won the 1988 Crime Writers Association Golden Dagger award, and people started asking when the next Zen book was due. </p> <p>While he has written four other one-off novels in the meantime and is currently working on another, Dibdin admits to relishing his series. \"You have to pay attention to all the people who may, or may not, have read the previous books. You have to be consistent with all problems that had happened to your character. There is a satisfying sense of follow-through that isn't there in one-offs. The problem is that it can degenerate into simply replication. But frankly I get bored if I'm not doing something new, so I come up with new stuff as a way of keeping myself interested.\" </p> <p>He says he is surprised that the series is so little used in mainstream literary fiction. \"Trollope did it all the time, but now it is fairly rare outside of genre.\" Dibdin operates very much at the literary end of the crime genre, and his work has a stylish intelligence that puts a lot of supposedly more literary fiction to shame. So how irksome to him is it that even the best crime fiction gets limited critical acclaim? </p> <p>\"I remember what Oscar Wilde said about moral or immoral books - they are either well written or badly written. Whether it's crime fiction or mainstream fiction, the good stuff survives and the other stuff doesn't. There is a nice little party game when you name 10 Booker-shortlisted writers and ask what they have in common. Most people's first reaction is to say, 'Who the fuck are some of these people?' \" </p> <p>The paperback of the seventh and latest Aurelio Zen book, Blood Rain, is published this month. In it the ageing and increasingly world-weary detective turns up in Sicily. While it seemed inevitable that Zen would one day face the Mafia, Dibdin was always conscious of the pitfalls. </p> <p>\"I was writing about a very violent island where a lot of extremely heroic people have gone to their death because they tried to do something right. I just thought it would be a little bit cheap, aesthetically and morally, to have my fictional detective go in there and come away without a scratch on him. It would look a little bit too easy, like Rambo sorting out the problems of east LA with two hand guns and a fast car.\" </p> <p>But as to how scratched Zen gets, you'll have to find out for yourself. Dibdin's cleverly layered prose ensures that by the conclusion of the novel everything remains possible. \"The shadow hanging over the death of my character is precisely the same as the shadow hanging over my own inevitable death. You know that sooner or later it must end, but to be honest, it's not something I think about all the time.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine reading Elmore Leonard for the first time; add a zest of Quentin Tarantino and John Woo and you might get an idea of the flavour of Douglas Winter's <strong> Run </strong> (Canongate \u00a39.99), a unique novel which transcends the hardboiled genre by a meaty mile. Burdon Lane looks like an unassuming traditional Washington DC businessman, but the appearance is skin-deep; he is actually a professional arms dealer, deadly when crossed. His weekend gun-run should be business as usual, riding the Iron Highway from Dirty City to Manhattan with his usual crew of friendly psychopaths, but once in New York all hell is set loose in an orgy of gunfire and flames. </p> <p>Lane has to hunt down the reasons and the men responsible, and he himself is forced to go on the run with the most improbable rap gangsta companion from the opposing team. His epic quest through the underbelly of American crime culminates in a church with an orgiastic display of gunpower, guts and blood. Winter's street-smart prose creates an unrelenting pace, crisscrossed by an unerring touch for gun fetishism and popular culture. The debut of the year, this book has all the ingredients of a future classic. And the biggest surprise of all?

      "bodyText": "Imagine reading Elmore Leonard for the first time; add a zest of Quentin Tarantino and John Woo and you might get an idea of the flavour of Douglas Winter's Run (Canongate \u00a39.99), a unique novel which transcends the hardboiled genre by a meaty mile. Burdon Lane looks like an unassuming traditional Washington DC businessman, but the appearance is skin-deep; he is actually a professional arms dealer, deadly when crossed. His weekend gun-run should be business as usual, riding the Iron Highway from Dirty City to Manhattan with his usual crew of friendly psychopaths, but once in New York all hell is set loose in an orgy of gunfire and flames. Lane has to hunt down the reasons and the men responsible, and he himself is forced to go on the run with the most improbable rap gangsta companion from the opposing team. His epic quest through the underbelly of American crime culminates in a church with an orgiastic display of gunpower, guts and blood. Winter's street-smart prose creates an unrelenting pace, crisscrossed by an unerring touch for gun fetishism and popular culture. The debut of the year, this book has all the ingredients of a future classic. And the biggest surprise of all? Winter is not some 20-year-old punk straight up from the mean streets but a fiftysomething white Washington attorney.

A palaeontologist will see them as fakes straight away, but they remind Stephen Jay Gould, science historian, curator and palaeontologist, of Dr Beringer of Wurzburg, who in 1726 was taken in by remarkable \"fossils\" of lizards in their skins, birds with beaks and eyes, spiders with their webs, bees feeding on flowers, the crescent moon, the sun with a human face, and even the Hebrew letters YHVH that spell out the name of God. </p> <p>Anyone now could see that such things had to have been faked (as indeed they were, by malicious colleagues). But in 1726, many scholars believed that organisms arose by spontaneous generation: if heat and light could magic living flesh from nothing, then it could also act upon \"lapidifying forces\" to conjure up stony little jests, sports of nature, testaments to God's mysterious ways. For a Christendom that believed the world to be 6,000 years old, created in seven days and washed clean by Noah's Flood, it seemed the only sensible explanation for stark ribcages or huge jawbones enclosed in limestone rocks. Humans have a way of seeing only what their world prepares them to see, which is why fossil fraud still flourishes. </p> <p>So far, Gould has composed 290 essays in more than a dozen collections over more than two decades, most of them taking a sympathetic view of bygone error.

Early in the 20th century, some Americans became troubled at the \"floods\" of asylum seekers and economic migrants reaching Ellis Island. To the poet of the Statue of Liberty they might have been teeming millions yearning to breathe free, but to Charles Benedict Davenport of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, home of American eugenics, they were the bearers of genetic traits for \"nomadism\" and \"feeble inhibition\". (Davenport carefully distinguished this from the nomadism shown by his own migrant ancestors, blessed instead with a gene for \"enterprising restlessness\".) </p> <p>Wanderlust, Davenport conceded, was a fundamental instinct which was typically \"inhibited in intelligent adults of civilised peoples\". Davenport was thinking explicitly of the \"hordes of Jews... with their intense individualism and ideals of gain at the cost of any interest\". He contrasted this with \"the early English and more recent Scandinavian immigration, with their ideals of community life in the open country, advancement by the sweat of the brow, and the uprearing of families in the fear of God and the love of country\". </p> <p>This wasn't a National Front pamphlet but a leading textbook called Heredity In Relation To Eugenics (1911). Such thinking hasn't gone away. History, Gould says, \"shows a consistent linkage between the genetic claims cast in this mould and conservative political arguments for maintenance of an unjust status quo of great benefit to people currently in power\".

He is actually more like Thomas Hardy. Substitute his name for Hardy's in this passage from Virginia Woolf's \"Personalities\": \"No one has written worse English than Mr Hardy in some of his novels - cumbrous, stilted, ugly and inexpressive - yes, but at the same time so strangely expressive of something attractive to us in Mr Hardy himself that we would not change it for the perfection of Sterne at his best.

As with the immaculate Sebald, the text is prefaced by blurry black and white uncaptioned photos, which do their necessary work: softening up the reader, reminding us that we we were not there and couldn't possibly know, that what follows is history and memory. Like a catch in the throat or a misty eye, they announce the book as elegy. </p> <p>The first story, \"Islands\", establishes the theme of exile and loss: \"We got up at dawn, ignored the yolky sun, loaded our navy-blue Austin with suitcases and then drove straight to the coast, stopping only on the verge of Sarajevo.\" If you really want to be honest about the effect of that opening sentence, replace that ultimate S-word with, say, \"Melton Mowbray\". </p> <p>There is simply more history and more drama - there are more events - in Hemon's short stories than in a shelf and a half of the usual dayglo Anglo-American entertainment: the Ukrainian uncle who had been in one of Stalin's camps in \"Islands\"; the imaginary account of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in \"The Accordion\".</p> <p>But history is only raw material; it is to Hemon's great advantage therefore that he's not merely in earnest, but also very sophisticated. Like Sebald or Hardy, or Raymond Carver - a palpable influence - what impresses in Hemon's work is both the extreme guile and the obvious sincerity (obvious sincerity, of course, being a product of extreme guile). Thus Hemon jostles the reader - \"But lo!, dear reader, while we were up to our waists in Pronek's stream of consciousness, fly-fishing for the psyche, the world did not stop revolving, the clock did not stop ticking\" - and generally monkeys around: \"Most of this story is a consequence of irresponsible imagination and shameless speculation.\" The two best stories, \"A Coin\" and \"Blind Josef Pronek and Dead Souls\", use every trick in the book. </p> <p>Most winningly of all, his cleverness is set off by a rather modest, shy and even prim narrative voice, which occasionally allows itself to slip into moralising and whimsy. In \"Exchange of Pleasant Words\", Hemon writes of the experience of exile that \"we have to live these half-lives of people who cannot forget what they used to be and who are afraid of being addressed in a foreign language, no longer able to utter anything truly meaningful.\" With this, to a greater or lesser extent, we are all familiar.</p>",

It charted the homecoming of Hilary Hook, who for 40 years had served as a colonial administrator in the highlands of Kenya. Now, returning from the tropics to a north London suburb, he floundered about his kitchen struggling to work out how to use a tin opener. Profumo, pop music, non-stick frying pans - all these had passed him by. He was home, but not at home. </p> <p>Younger viewers in particular, who thought of colonialism as a backdrop to the costume dramas of the early 1980s, found it strange to watch someone who was both a product and an agent of such an antique world order. Here was a man, charming and intelligent, who saw modern life as a foreign country: this twinkling octogenarian came across as a time-traveller. After all, doesn't colonialism belong to some other, long-gone universe? </p> <p>Not according to Riccardo Orizio, the Italian journalist who has produced Lost White Tribes, a superb and beguiling work in which he travels in search of the long-forgotten descendants of those Europeans who voyaged to the colonies and, unlike Hook, never came back. These include Dutch burghers in Sri Lanka; German workers and acrobats who sailed to Jamaica after Abolition and ended up as slaves themselves; American confederates from Texas and Alabama who fled to Brazil after the Civil War hoping to fashion a new Dixieland out of the cotton and slaves available to them there; and Polish soldiers sent to quell the slave rebellions in the French colony of Saint-Domingue at the start of the 19th century, and who ended up fighting on the side of the insurgent Haitians. </p> <p>Most of these groups are missing from both hipster tour guides and the colonial archive. Often they've become apocryphal creatures within their own countries, mistaken for missionaries or dismissed - correctly, in the case of the Blancs Matignon in Guadeloupe - as incestuous peasants. They're torn between the desire to be heard - to reach out to a wider world that might rescue them from penury - and a survivalist suspicion that their long-guarded secrets may be exploited by novelty-chasing outsiders. So they teeter on in straitened circumstances: many Germans died from disease or malnutrition when they first arrived in 19th-century Jamaica, and their descendants, still straggly and emaciated, were deemed just right to play prisoners when the film Papillon was shot there. </p> <p>This is emphatically not a history of the white colonial elites.

      "bodyText": "Lost White Tribes: Journeys Among The Forgotten Riccardo Orizio Secker &amp; Warburg, \u00a315.99, 270pp Buy it at BOL Some years ago Molly Dineen made a wonderful documentary called Home From The Hill. It charted the homecoming of Hilary Hook, who for 40 years had served as a colonial administrator in the highlands of Kenya. Now, returning from the tropics to a north London suburb, he floundered about his kitchen struggling to work out how to use a tin opener. Profumo, pop music, non-stick frying pans - all these had passed him by. He was home, but not at home. Younger viewers in particular, who thought of colonialism as a backdrop to the costume dramas of the early 1980s, found it strange to watch someone who was both a product and an agent of such an antique world order. Here was a man, charming and intelligent, who saw modern life as a foreign country: this twinkling octogenarian came across as a time-traveller. After all, doesn't colonialism belong to some other, long-gone universe? Not according to Riccardo Orizio, the Italian journalist who has produced Lost White Tribes, a superb and beguiling work in which he travels in search of the long-forgotten descendants of those Europeans who voyaged to the colonies and, unlike Hook, never came back. These include Dutch burghers in Sri Lanka; German workers and acrobats who sailed to Jamaica after Abolition and ended up as slaves themselves; American confederates from Texas and Alabama who fled to Brazil after the Civil War hoping to fashion a new Dixieland out of the cotton and slaves available to them there; and Polish soldiers sent to quell the slave rebellions in the French colony of Saint-Domingue at the start of the 19th century, and who ended up fighting on the side of the insurgent Haitians. Most of these groups are missing from both hipster tour guides and the colonial archive. Often they've become apocryphal creatures within their own countries, mistaken for missionaries or dismissed - correctly, in the case of the Blancs Matignon in Guadeloupe - as incestuous peasants. They're torn between the desire to be heard - to reach out to a wider world that might rescue them from penury - and a survivalist suspicion that their long-guarded secrets may be exploited by novelty-chasing outsiders. So they teeter on in straitened circumstances: many Germans died from disease or malnutrition when they first arrived in 19th-century Jamaica, and their descendants, still straggly and emaciated, were deemed just right to play prisoners when the film Papillon was shot there. This is emphatically not a history of the white colonial elites. Orizio's white tribes may live in the shadow of opulent resorts or Great House plantations, but their own communities can often be reached only by pot-holed mud tracks. The Poles in Casales live in dried mud houses on a treeless mountain. They have no electricity, running water or school; their church collapsed years ago. Now that their skin is as dark as Haitians', all the ancestry they have left is the hint of Slavic cheekbones and a dance they call the polka - and a framed photo of the Pope, who visited the island 20 years ago and who they still dream will rescue them. Orizio finds that these dispersed communities have much in common, chiefly a fear of extinction (the Basters of Namibia have had their land confiscated and are forced to speak English rather than Afrikaans at school) and an ambivalence towards miscegenation (the Germans in Jamaica look askance at marriage to black islanders, while the Confederates in Brazil reserve their scorn for those who marry native Indians).

      "body": "<p>Eight years ago, Michael Ondaatje was doing pretty well. He was feted at home in Canada as a poet and novelist, and revered in the wider literary world. Then came The English Patient, his tale of romance in the Sahara and wartime intrigue in a Tuscan villa. It was his third novel: it co-won the Booker prize in 1992 and four years later was adapted into the Hollywood movie starring Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas. The film was a huge box office success, won nine Oscars, and dragged the intensely private author into clamorous celebrity. Since then, worldwide English-language sales of the book have topped 2 million. </p> <p>Ondaatje is a man who works at his own pace. The English Patient was his third novel in 25 years; Anil's Ghost, his latest, took seven years to write. It has a familiar luminous intensity that blurs the boundary between prose and poetry, but it offers little of the epic passion viewers of the film might seek. Though it too charts intimate lives in wartime, it is set in the near-present amid the bloodshed of Sri Lanka, the birthplace Ondaatje left as an 11-year-old child. </p> <p>He is ambivalent about the fame The English Patient brought him. On the other hand, \"Even if people expect you to write romance, it gave me the freedom to write anything I wanted.\" </p> <p>His first impulse was to return to poetry, with Handwriting (1998). This was set entirely in Sri Lanka, which he began to revisit only in his 30s. Though his initial trips spawned the quasi-memoir Running In The Family (1982), his 10 other poetry volumes and his fiction gave few clues about the island of his birth. Handwriting, together with Anil's Ghost (\"the two books go hand in hand\"), complete a journey back to his source. </p> <p>His first two novels are set in North America, and it is that part of his life and work that came to mind when we met in a downtown skyscraper on a Toronto street leading to Lake Ontario. The neon-lit artery was memorably fixed in the novel, In The Skin Of A Lion (1987), which mapped and mythologised the author's adopted city: the dashing neighbourhood thief Caravaggio has \"a parting in his dark hair like Yonge Street at midnight\". And Ondaatje's rapid but softly elided speech recalls another character in the book, Patrick Lewis, whose \"conversations lost some of their syllables out of shyness, vagueness, uncertainty\". Voluble on writing and his other arts - theatre, film, photography - Ondaatje shrinks from personal inquiries. He prefers to write from anonymity, from a watchful invisibility, maintaining the unmediated bond between writer and reader. </p> <p>Ondaatje was born in 1943 in Colombo, the capital of the British colony of Ceylon, the youngest of four. Of Tamil, Sinhalese and Dutch descent - an inheritance seen in his blue-eyed gaze - he is often taken to be a member of the closed Dutch-descended Burgher community, although his ancestry is perhaps more mixed than that. According to family lore, a Tamil forebear came from south India in 1600 as a doctor, healed the Dutch governor's daughter and was rewarded with a Dutch wife and spelling of his name. When his wife died, he married a Sinhalese woman. \"My background is a real salad, so it's difficult to know who I am,\" Ondaatje laughs. </p> <p>His earliest years were spent on the Kutapitiya tea estate (\"the most beautiful place in the world\") in the last era of colonial Ceylon, before the estates were nationalised. Though his memoir depicts the halcyon days of a westernised elite, where \"nobody really had to grow up; they remained wild and spoiled\", he describes his family as \"on the edge of hard times\". His brother Christopher, a businessman and explorer, thought his memoir romanticised. Ondaatje says, \"It was probably an easier childhood for me than for my brother and sisters, being the youngest.\" </p> <p>His mother, Doris Gratiaen, was given to dancing in the style of Isadora Duncan. His father, Mervyn Ondaatje, was in the Ceylon light infantry and supervised a tea plantation before losing jobs through alcoholism (\"My father was in tea and alcohol; he dealt in tea and he drank the alcohol\"). In one poem Ondaatje wrote of the \"terrifying comedy\" of his father's life: \"My mother divorced him again and again./He would rush into tunnels magnetised/by the white eye of trains\". </p> <p>Ceylon gained independence in 1948. It was a tumultuous time for Michael, too. His parents separated when he was five. Then, when his mother went to England the following year with Christopher and his sister Janet, he was left behind with relatives. \"My memory is very vivid, of being quite solitary, though not alone - I was scattered with uncles and aunts.\" Five years later, aged 11, he followed his mother to London. She was seeing her children through school by working in hotels and living in bedsits. They were, says Ondaatje, \"rough times\". </p> <p> At school in Dulwich College, his initial trauma was having to relinquish the sarong. \"I had to dress differently. I'd never seen a tie before. It was all very new.\" Though his school was \"in retrospect a haven for young writers\" (he was preceded by PG Wodehouse and Raymond Chandler, and followed by his friend Graham Swift), he remembers being more keen on sports. He is amused that a former teacher was quoted in the Times as praising Swift for winning the Booker while expressing surprise that Ondaatje should do the same since he had \"always seemed more interested in cricket\". </p> <p>Feeling lost and an \"outsider\" created a gulf between him and his relatives. \"There was a romance about England among the uncles; nostalgia for their years abroad. It was confusing. You don't know if you're responding to England as a weird, tough time because you're a teenager - every teenager is lost and at war with everything.\" In any case, at 19, he left for Canada, where his brother was living in Montreal. And it was at university in Quebec and Toronto that he first began to write poetry. \"In Canada you felt you could do anything. I wouldn't have been a writer if I'd stayed in England. I met young writers and editors\" - including at the small press Coachhouse, whose board he still sits on. \"It wasn't like England, where you feel, what right do you have to do this because of John Donne and Sir Philip Sidney. England felt repressive in the 50s.\" </p> <p>Much of Ondaatje's early poetry was about his new land of Canada. The Collected Works Of Billy The Kid (1970) was something different: mongrelising genres, blurring fact and fiction in an imaginative collage, he dissected a legend of his boyhood. It ends with a photograph of him as a child in Wild West gear. \"It grew out of my childhood fantasies, wanting to be a cowboy,\" he says. \"It was an unofficial version - improvised. I just took the facts that he died at 21 and killed 21 people and went underground with it. We've only had the clich\u00e9s, but I wanted to write something ominous and dangerous and fresh. I'd been a poet, and half way through the book I switched, rearranging scenes, using poetry, prose, white space, song, photography.\" He even invented a diary. \"The book was a fake documentary. My favourite review was by a Texan who said: Why was a Canadian given the right to edit the journals of Billy the Kid?\" </p> <p>\"Fiction,\" Ondaatje says, \"is the most conservative of genres - still mostly handcuffed to realism.\" But he sought new ways of telling. A \"child of the movies\", he relishes the influence of other arts, whether Henri Rousseau paintings, Diego Rivera murals, Sri Lankan temple sculpture or jazz. Coming Through Slaughter (1976), his first prose work, fictionalised the life of the jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden, the cornetist in turn-of-the-century New Orleans who went mad on a public parade. It shows the background of brothels and knife-fights in which jazz flourished, and its syntax carries the music. \"Of all the arts, jazz is the one I envy the most,\" he says. \"It's communal, free, you can improvise. If I could be Fats Waller, I wouldn't be writing.\" </p> <p>Ondaatje is a migrant of the imagination, crossing borders all the time, creatively and geographically, from prose to poetry to film. He was making documentary films in the 70s, and it was one of these that turned his mind back to his birthplace. \"It was a film about a theatre company, where the director went with a troupe of actors back to Ontario farming country. He'd done a lovely regional memoir, like writers I love - Faulkner, Alice Monro - and I was envious. Others, like myself, don't have those deep regional roots, those wells.\" </p> <p>In Running In The Family, he wrote: \"In my mid-30s I realised I had slipped past a childhood I had ignored and not understood.\" He says now, \"It wasn't so much ignoring as having to survive in the west. You were learning so much at age 11, and having to adapt very fast to a different way of life. And I literally couldn't afford to go to Sri Lanka; it was something very present but far away.\" He found himself dreaming of Asia in frozen Toronto, and while teaching at university spent a sabbatical in Sri Lanka in 1978. \"I'd lost my childhood, so I had to reinvent it. Going to places starts you remembering things.\" </p> <p>His fictionalised, often funny family memoir - \"not a history but a portrait or gesture\" - grew from local folklore. It depicts a lost generation of flamboyant eccentrics with nostalgia, but also distance. One portrait is of his grandmother, Lalle, prone to the odd swig of eau de cologne, who \"died of natural causes - floods\". Ondaatje says: \"My grandmother was a woman I hardly knew, but I used anecdotes; it was exaggerated, so it echoed the way people remembered. Books are communal acts; because of that you can escape autobiography into something more than yourself.\" </p> <p>As Ondaatje was writing the memoir, his marriage since 1964 to Kim Jones, a Canadian artist with whom he had two children, broke up, and a relationship developed with the woman who would become his second wife, novelist Linda Spalding. The circumstances quickened an impulse to pursue the tragic enigma at the memoir's heart: his father. \"You write books when you need to write them,\" he says. \"I'd been writing Running In The Family, and it was quite light, a restoration comedy. Then the darker nature of my father came in; there's a need to write about family when there's a break-up.\" </p> <p>His father had died of a brain haemorrhage after Ondaatje left. \"My loss was that I never spoke to him as an adult,\" he wrote. \"He is still one of those books we long to read whose pages remain uncut.\" Ondaatje adds: \"He was a sad and mercurial figure. There was a lot I didn't know about him, and that was recurring in my books: trying to find the central character. It became a habit. In all my books there are mysteries that are not fully told.\" </p> <p>In two earlier books, both Billy and Buddy, dazzling outlaws and talents, are pursued by sleuths - Pat Garrett and the cop Webb. We learn about them from a slow accumulation of detail, shards of information, like a son searching for a lost father, or a novelist for the elusive voice of his characters. \"I can't write novels where the author knows a character completely,\" says Ondaatje. \"When they're off stage, they're off stage; the ending isn't a closed door. I love the idea of characters having lives outside the book; it makes them equal to the writer and the reader, rather than the author talking down to them, like puppets.\" </p> <p> In the Skin Of A Lion is still considered Ondaatje's masterpiece. In it, Patrick is the \"searcher\" on the trail of a millionaire who disappeared in 1919. As Patrick leaves rural Ontario for the city in the 20s, he joins European migrants - Finns, Macedonians, Italians, Greeks - in the \"fairytale of Upper America\". They are workers, such as the daredevil bridge-builder Nicholas Temelcoff, who built Toronto but would \"never leave his name where his skill had been\". \"I was interested in the building of a city,\" says Ondaatje. \"And migration as metaphor: it's not just a contemporary issue, it's how the whole country was formed. The 'establishment' in the 60s, when I got there, was all immigrant families, with the wonderful variety of values that is, hopefully, the saving grace of any culture. That story was much more heroic than any put forward as officially heroic: people coming to a new country, learning a new language and working in rough circumstances.\" </p> <p>Racism is tackled obliquely - the thief Caravaggio is beaten up in jail for being a \"wop\" - but it is the meticulous evocation of work, alongside love, that is a hallmark of Ondaatje's fiction. He writes absorbingly of bridge-building and demolition, bomb disposal and surgery. \"You have to make the character as believable as possible. We are governed by what we do. I'm a writer sitting down alone for several hours a day, and it makes me a certain kind of person - though writers are no better than bridge-builders or trumpet players. Writing about work is a way of getting close to how people think.\" </p> <p>A migrant's perspective - \"the tense rubbing together of two distinct worlds\" - fosters innovations of form. Ondaatje quotes as a principle John Berger's \"Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one\". His fiction disrupts linear time with copious flashbacks and flash-forwards, spurning the omniscient narrator for a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints. The English Patient grew from a \"chamber piece\" about four characters in a Tuscan villa in the final days of the second world war - including Canadians from the previous novel, Caravaggio and Patrick's stepdaughter Hana - into an epic novel with flashbacks spanning Cairo, the Sahara and England. The \"English patient\", Count Almasy, charred into facelessness by a plane crash, is a Hungarian explorer, maybe a spy, recalling a tragic affair with a married Englishwoman, as he lies dying. </p> <p>The fourth figure in the villa quartet, the Sikh sapper Kirpal Singh, or Kip, was Ondaatje's first Asian character, and through him the novel presents a suppressed history. \"All the mythology of the second world war I grew up with in the 50s - from Commander Crab books to movies like The Dambusters - seemed utterly white,\" Ondaatje says. \"They were English or American, or French with a big accent; those were the 'Allies'. But I also knew there was another version of that history - Asians at war. A population of soldiers from India was massacred; they were not just background. Also, it was a very one-sided view in movies; there was no talk of the damage, the hundreds of thousands of people killed.\" </p> <p>Ondaatje was a consultant on the film, produced by Saul Zaentz with a screenplay by Minghella. His role grew as he became fascinated by the craft. While he remains loyal friends with the filmmakers and defends the film as its own entity, he sums up the experience as \"odd\". Much was lost in translation. One consequence of the paring down of flashbacks - and the logic of Hollywood's star system - was that the 30s romance between the ageing Almasy (played by the much younger Fiennes) and Katharine (Scott -Thomas in a fleshed-out part) became central, while the role of Kip (Naveen Andrews), who has an affair with the nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche), shrank. \"That was the sad part for me and Minghella . . . I really missed Kip in the film. I felt closer to Kip and Hana when I was writing it. There was a loss.\" </p> <p>That loss obscured other meanings. While the novel explores private and public betrayals, it forms part of a literature remapping the post-colonial world. As three continents meet in a villa in 1945, a shift is marked from the dying patient's era of European mapmaking and flag-planting to the younger characters from India, nearing independence, and the New World. \"The novel was a debate between old-age humanism - the patient - and the new age of Kip,\" Ondaatje says. \"It was a historical moment that remapped the world, when the balance shifted from colonialism.\" </p> <p>Kip's liberation from his English mentors comes through radio news of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, which opens his eyes to the atrocities of the \"civilised\" west, both as a bomb disposal expert and as an Asian. That scene was missing from the film, though it remains close to Ondaatje's heart. His experience has left him frustrated with the medium. \"It's an irony about the film that a personal death becomes more important than a war crime. But the Hiroshima scene didn't work. In the book, I can bring something in in the last chapter that makes it all look ironic; in a film it looks like someone put in the wrong reel.\" </p> <p>After Kip's cinematic sidelining, to write a novel completely devoid of white characters, as is Anil's Ghost, seems almost a riposte. \"I was writing it before, but that was a little gesture; I kind of like that,\" Ondaatje laughs with glee. Like its predecessor, it is an anti-war novel of a kind. But the war is Sri Lanka's civil conflict, focused on a period in the mid-80s to early 90s when the government was combating both Tamil separatists and Sinhalese insurgents. </p> <p>The novel moves with the suspense of a mystery, yet with breathtaking grace. Its sleuth is Anil Tissera, a forensic anthropologist who left Sri Lanka for London at 18 and has returned from the US 15 years later, on behalf of a human rights body, to identify a skeleton as a victim of government \"counter-terror\". Like her creator, she speaks vestiges of Sinhala (Ondaatje also grew up speaking some Tamil); he insists that Anil is not autobiographical. </p> <p>Ondaatje had been wary of tackling the crisis, wary of being taken as representative. \"I do backflips to avoid that. There's a tendency with us in England and north America to say it's a book 'about Sri Lanka'. But it's just my take on a few characters, a personal tunnelling into that - not the statement about the war, as though this is the true and only story. Most events are private - individuals dealing with relatives and lovers. The book's not just about Sri Lanka; it's a story that's very familiar in other parts of the world.\" </p> <p>Does he feel a responsibility to use his raised profile to speak out? \"No, it would seem didactic,\" he says. But then he relates the legend of a king who wakes up with a corpse around his neck. \"Each day he buries it, and the next day it's round his neck again. It was strange and nightmarish, someone trying to save a community, and it hit me that I had that kind of obsession Anil has with the skeleton.\" </p> <p>He also began to excavate his own buried origins. \"I see the world as utterly dangerous,\" Ondaatje has said, \"that it's a very tenuous, accidental world and what you love, especially the people you love, can be swept away in an instant.\" He dedicated Handwriting to the ayah, or nanny, from whom he was wrenched as a child, \"a lost almost-mother in those years/of thirsty love\". \"I remember leaving Sri Lanka and being devastated by leaving her,\" he says sadly. \"When I went back she'd died.\" </p> <p>In the novel, the Sinhalese Anil returns to a happier reunion with her Tamil ayah which hints at deep links between the communities wracked by fratricide - and which mingle in Ondaatje's own bloodlines. \"It's a tragedy of a country that's multicultural and multi-religious, but splits happen,\" he says. \"I'm also seeing it from the west; I don't think there's one side that's right or wrong.\" Though the novel contains love and passion: \"Subliminally or unconsciously, everything in the book became about one thing: separations. It's a very celibate book - everything's in the past or repressed.\" </p> <p>While Running In The Family noted the condescension of European travellers to Sri Lanka, such as Edward Lear and DH Lawrence, the dangers of political tourism are spelled out in Anil's Ghost. As one character snorts: \"American movies, English books - remember how they all end? The American or the Englishman gets on a plane and leaves. That's it. The camera leaves with him . . . It's probably the history of the last 200 years of western political writing. Go home. Write a book. Hit the circuit.\" </p> <p>So how does any writer from abroad avoid that approach? \"I don't know,\" Ondaatje says. \"I'm as guilty as anyone else. I didn't want to go in and make assured judgments - 'clean up your act'. That would be incendiary and facile.\" The solution was partly to be open on his visits. \"I was learning a lot just by being passive in the way I listened. It's more rewarding than trying to go out and grab the truth, as we do in the west, as though we know how to solve this problem, how to fix it. It's more complex than that.\" </p> <p>Though he describes himself as a Canadian writer, Ondaatje is clear: \"I don't think I'm a north American solely; Sri Lanka is a place I love and feel very much part of.\" He put his Booker winnings into the creation of the Gratiaen prize (named after his mother) for Sri Lankan writers based on the island; recent winners include a \"lost classic\" by Tissa Abeysekara. His own uprooting has been matched by a restless creativity. \"Moving, you learn twice as much; it doubles you in some way, like living three or four lives,\" he says. \"There's a parallel between the writer and the migrant: in a way, writers are immigrants if you're writing about a new place.

      "bodyText": "Eight years ago, Michael Ondaatje was doing pretty well. He was feted at home in Canada as a poet and novelist, and revered in the wider literary world. Then came The English Patient, his tale of romance in the Sahara and wartime intrigue in a Tuscan villa. It was his third novel: it co-won the Booker prize in 1992 and four years later was adapted into the Hollywood movie starring Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas. The film was a huge box office success, won nine Oscars, and dragged the intensely private author into clamorous celebrity. Since then, worldwide English-language sales of the book have topped 2 million. Ondaatje is a man who works at his own pace. The English Patient was his third novel in 25 years; Anil's Ghost, his latest, took seven years to write. It has a familiar luminous intensity that blurs the boundary between prose and poetry, but it offers little of the epic passion viewers of the film might seek. Though it too charts intimate lives in wartime, it is set in the near-present amid the bloodshed of Sri Lanka, the birthplace Ondaatje left as an 11-year-old child. He is ambivalent about the fame The English Patient brought him. On the other hand, \"Even if people expect you to write romance, it gave me the freedom to write anything I wanted.\" His first impulse was to return to poetry, with Handwriting (1998). This was set entirely in Sri Lanka, which he began to revisit only in his 30s. Though his initial trips spawned the quasi-memoir Running In The Family (1982), his 10 other poetry volumes and his fiction gave few clues about the island of his birth. Handwriting, together with Anil's Ghost (\"the two books go hand in hand\"), complete a journey back to his source. His first two novels are set in North America, and it is that part of his life and work that came to mind when we met in a downtown skyscraper on a Toronto street leading to Lake Ontario. The neon-lit artery was memorably fixed in the novel, In The Skin Of A Lion (1987), which mapped and mythologised the author's adopted city: the dashing neighbourhood thief Caravaggio has \"a parting in his dark hair like Yonge Street at midnight\". And Ondaatje's rapid but softly elided speech recalls another character in the book, Patrick Lewis, whose \"conversations lost some of their syllables out of shyness, vagueness, uncertainty\". Voluble on writing and his other arts - theatre, film, photography - Ondaatje shrinks from personal inquiries. He prefers to write from anonymity, from a watchful invisibility, maintaining the unmediated bond between writer and reader. Ondaatje was born in 1943 in Colombo, the capital of the British colony of Ceylon, the youngest of four. Of Tamil, Sinhalese and Dutch descent - an inheritance seen in his blue-eyed gaze - he is often taken to be a member of the closed Dutch-descended Burgher community, although his ancestry is perhaps more mixed than that. According to family lore, a Tamil forebear came from south India in 1600 as a doctor, healed the Dutch governor's daughter and was rewarded with a Dutch wife and spelling of his name. When his wife died, he married a Sinhalese woman. \"My background is a real salad, so it's difficult to know who I am,\" Ondaatje laughs. His earliest years were spent on the Kutapitiya tea estate (\"the most beautiful place in the world\") in the last era of colonial Ceylon, before the estates were nationalised. Though his memoir depicts the halcyon days of a westernised elite, where \"nobody really had to grow up; they remained wild and spoiled\", he describes his family as \"on the edge of hard times\". His brother Christopher, a businessman and explorer, thought his memoir romanticised. Ondaatje says, \"It was probably an easier childhood for me than for my brother and sisters, being the youngest.\" His mother, Doris Gratiaen, was given to dancing in the style of Isadora Duncan. His father, Mervyn Ondaatje, was in the Ceylon light infantry and supervised a tea plantation before losing jobs through alcoholism (\"My father was in tea and alcohol; he dealt in tea and he drank the alcohol\"). In one poem Ondaatje wrote of the \"terrifying comedy\" of his father's life: \"My mother divorced him again and again./He would rush into tunnels magnetised/by the white eye of trains\". Ceylon gained independence in 1948. It was a tumultuous time for Michael, too. His parents separated when he was five. Then, when his mother went to England the following year with Christopher and his sister Janet, he was left behind with relatives. \"My memory is very vivid, of being quite solitary, though not alone - I was scattered with uncles and aunts.\" Five years later, aged 11, he followed his mother to London. She was seeing her children through school by working in hotels and living in bedsits. They were, says Ondaatje, \"rough times\". At school in Dulwich College, his initial trauma was having to relinquish the sarong. \"I had to dress differently. I'd never seen a tie before. It was all very new.\" Though his school was \"in retrospect a haven for young writers\" (he was preceded by PG Wodehouse and Raymond Chandler, and followed by his friend Graham Swift), he remembers being more keen on sports. He is amused that a former teacher was quoted in the Times as praising Swift for winning the Booker while expressing surprise that Ondaatje should do the same since he had \"always seemed more interested in cricket\". Feeling lost and an \"outsider\" created a gulf between him and his relatives. \"There was a romance about England among the uncles; nostalgia for their years abroad. It was confusing. You don't know if you're responding to England as a weird, tough time because you're a teenager - every teenager is lost and at war with everything.\" In any case, at 19, he left for Canada, where his brother was living in Montreal. And it was at university in Quebec and Toronto that he first began to write poetry. \"In Canada you felt you could do anything. I wouldn't have been a writer if I'd stayed in England. I met young writers and editors\" - including at the small press Coachhouse, whose board he still sits on. \"It wasn't like England, where you feel, what right do you have to do this because of John Donne and Sir Philip Sidney. England felt repressive in the 50s.\" Much of Ondaatje's early poetry was about his new land of Canada. The Collected Works Of Billy The Kid (1970) was something different: mongrelising genres, blurring fact and fiction in an imaginative collage, he dissected a legend of his boyhood. It ends with a photograph of him as a child in Wild West gear. \"It grew out of my childhood fantasies, wanting to be a cowboy,\" he says. \"It was an unofficial version - improvised. I just took the facts that he died at 21 and killed 21 people and went underground with it. We've only had the clich\u00e9s, but I wanted to write something ominous and dangerous and fresh. I'd been a poet, and half way through the book I switched, rearranging scenes, using poetry, prose, white space, song, photography.\" He even invented a diary. \"The book was a fake documentary. My favourite review was by a Texan who said: Why was a Canadian given the right to edit the journals of Billy the Kid?\" \"Fiction,\" Ondaatje says, \"is the most conservative of genres - still mostly handcuffed to realism.\" But he sought new ways of telling. A \"child of the movies\", he relishes the influence of other arts, whether Henri Rousseau paintings, Diego Rivera murals, Sri Lankan temple sculpture or jazz. Coming Through Slaughter (1976), his first prose work, fictionalised the life of the jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden, the cornetist in turn-of-the-century New Orleans who went mad on a public parade. It shows the background of brothels and knife-fights in which jazz flourished, and its syntax carries the music. \"Of all the arts, jazz is the one I envy the most,\" he says. \"It's communal, free, you can improvise. If I could be Fats Waller, I wouldn't be writing.\" Ondaatje is a migrant of the imagination, crossing borders all the time, creatively and geographically, from prose to poetry to film. He was making documentary films in the 70s, and it was one of these that turned his mind back to his birthplace. \"It was a film about a theatre company, where the director went with a troupe of actors back to Ontario farming country. He'd done a lovely regional memoir, like writers I love - Faulkner, Alice Monro - and I was envious. Others, like myself, don't have those deep regional roots, those wells.\" In Running In The Family, he wrote: \"In my mid-30s I realised I had slipped past a childhood I had ignored and not understood.\" He says now, \"It wasn't so much ignoring as having to survive in the west. You were learning so much at age 11, and having to adapt very fast to a different way of life. And I literally couldn't afford to go to Sri Lanka; it was something very present but far away.\" He found himself dreaming of Asia in frozen Toronto, and while teaching at university spent a sabbatical in Sri Lanka in 1978. \"I'd lost my childhood, so I had to reinvent it. Going to places starts you remembering things.\" His fictionalised, often funny family memoir - \"not a history but a portrait or gesture\" - grew from local folklore. It depicts a lost generation of flamboyant eccentrics with nostalgia, but also distance. One portrait is of his grandmother, Lalle, prone to the odd swig of eau de cologne, who \"died of natural causes - floods\". Ondaatje says: \"My grandmother was a woman I hardly knew, but I used anecdotes; it was exaggerated, so it echoed the way people remembered. Books are communal acts; because of that you can escape autobiography into something more than yourself.\" As Ondaatje was writing the memoir, his marriage since 1964 to Kim Jones, a Canadian artist with whom he had two children, broke up, and a relationship developed with the woman who would become his second wife, novelist Linda Spalding. The circumstances quickened an impulse to pursue the tragic enigma at the memoir's heart: his father. \"You write books when you need to write them,\" he says. \"I'd been writing Running In The Family, and it was quite light, a restoration comedy. Then the darker nature of my father came in; there's a need to write about family when there's a break-up.\" His father had died of a brain haemorrhage after Ondaatje left. \"My loss was that I never spoke to him as an adult,\" he wrote. \"He is still one of those books we long to read whose pages remain uncut.\" Ondaatje adds: \"He was a sad and mercurial figure. There was a lot I didn't know about him, and that was recurring in my books: trying to find the central character. It became a habit. In all my books there are mysteries that are not fully told.\" In two earlier books, both Billy and Buddy, dazzling outlaws and talents, are pursued by sleuths - Pat Garrett and the cop Webb. We learn about them from a slow accumulation of detail, shards of information, like a son searching for a lost father, or a novelist for the elusive voice of his characters. \"I can't write novels where the author knows a character completely,\" says Ondaatje. \"When they're off stage, they're off stage; the ending isn't a closed door. I love the idea of characters having lives outside the book; it makes them equal to the writer and the reader, rather than the author talking down to them, like puppets.\" In the Skin Of A Lion is still considered Ondaatje's masterpiece. In it, Patrick is the \"searcher\" on the trail of a millionaire who disappeared in 1919. As Patrick leaves rural Ontario for the city in the 20s, he joins European migrants - Finns, Macedonians, Italians, Greeks - in the \"fairytale of Upper America\". They are workers, such as the daredevil bridge-builder Nicholas Temelcoff, who built Toronto but would \"never leave his name where his skill had been\". \"I was interested in the building of a city,\" says Ondaatje. \"And migration as metaphor: it's not just a contemporary issue, it's how the whole country was formed. The 'establishment' in the 60s, when I got there, was all immigrant families, with the wonderful variety of values that is, hopefully, the saving grace of any culture. That story was much more heroic than any put forward as officially heroic: people coming to a new country, learning a new language and working in rough circumstances.\" Racism is tackled obliquely - the thief Caravaggio is beaten up in jail for being a \"wop\" - but it is the meticulous evocation of work, alongside love, that is a hallmark of Ondaatje's fiction. He writes absorbingly of bridge-building and demolition, bomb disposal and surgery. \"You have to make the character as believable as possible. We are governed by what we do. I'm a writer sitting down alone for several hours a day, and it makes me a certain kind of person - though writers are no better than bridge-builders or trumpet players. Writing about work is a way of getting close to how people think.\" A migrant's perspective - \"the tense rubbing together of two distinct worlds\" - fosters innovations of form. Ondaatje quotes as a principle John Berger's \"Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one\". His fiction disrupts linear time with copious flashbacks and flash-forwards, spurning the omniscient narrator for a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints. The English Patient grew from a \"chamber piece\" about four characters in a Tuscan villa in the final days of the second world war - including Canadians from the previous novel, Caravaggio and Patrick's stepdaughter Hana - into an epic novel with flashbacks spanning Cairo, the Sahara and England. The \"English patient\", Count Almasy, charred into facelessness by a plane crash, is a Hungarian explorer, maybe a spy, recalling a tragic affair with a married Englishwoman, as he lies dying. The fourth figure in the villa quartet, the Sikh sapper Kirpal Singh, or Kip, was Ondaatje's first Asian character, and through him the novel presents a suppressed history. \"All the mythology of the second world war I grew up with in the 50s - from Commander Crab books to movies like The Dambusters - seemed utterly white,\" Ondaatje says. \"They were English or American, or French with a big accent; those were the 'Allies'. But I also knew there was another version of that history - Asians at war. A population of soldiers from India was massacred; they were not just background. Also, it was a very one-sided view in movies; there was no talk of the damage, the hundreds of thousands of people killed.\" Ondaatje was a consultant on the film, produced by Saul Zaentz with a screenplay by Minghella. His role grew as he became fascinated by the craft. While he remains loyal friends with the filmmakers and defends the film as its own entity, he sums up the experience as \"odd\". Much was lost in translation.

      "body": "<p>The US government called for Microsoft to be broken up yesterday in a hard-hitting proposal designed to stop the company abusing its stranglehold on the world's computer market. </p> <p>Microsoft will be broken into two separate companies - one to develop the Windows operating system and the other to run all other applications such as Office - under proposals filed to the US district court by the justice department and various states last night. </p> <p>Bill Gates, whose stake in the company he founded 25 years ago had made him until recently the world's richest man by a wide margin, would be forced to choose which company to invest in under the proposals, while other shareholders are likely to receive a share in both. The company accused the government of \"indefensible, radical and extreme\" proposals yesterday. Mr Gates said: \"Microsoft would be greatly damaged by any kind of split.\" </p> <p>The government's proposals, filed after the New York stock market closed last night, will be considered by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson alongside those of the company before he delivers his own verdict on an appropriate remedy later this year. </p> <p>Earlier this month, he ruled that the Seattle-based company had broken the law with its anti-competitive behaviour. Any break-up plan, even if agreed by the judge, is likely to be some years off because of the company's plans to appeal. However, yesterday's filing also included several tough restrictions on the company's behaviour as well as a 10-year bar on any future merger of the two separate groups. The restrictions include making Microsoft offer uniform pricing for the leading computer manufacturers as well as barring any attempt to penalise competitors who gave evidence during the trial. </p> <p>Joel Klein, assistant attorney general, said the restrictions \"can and should go into effect immediately\" and should last until a break-up of the company is complete. Mr Klein, who has led the government's efforts as head of the anti-trust division at the justice department, said a break-up was the best way to improve competition in the software industry. </p> <p>\"Under our proposals, neither the heavy hand of ongoing government regulation nor the self-interest of an entrenched monopolist will decide what is in the best interests of consumers. Consumers will be able to decide for themselves in a fair and competitive marketplace, which is the over-riding purpose of America's anti-trust laws.\" </p> <p>Legal experts and analysts said the plan, if backed by the judge, would be as significant as the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 or that of AT&amp;T in 1984. </p> <p>Mr Klein used the example of the break-up of AT&amp;T for improving competition in the telecommunications industry in the US. Bill Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington university, said: \"This case will define the rules by which dominant firms must play.\" </p> <p>Microsoft has already been badly damaged by the case. The company's stock market value has fallen by more than 40% since the beginning of the year when it was the world's most highly valued group. Mr Gates has seen his net worth shrink from more than $100bn to about $60bn. </p> <p>Janet Reno, the US attorney general, said: \"This is the right remedy at the right time to stimulate competition, promote innovation and give consumers more choice.\" Until this week, most analysts had expected the government to propose so-called conduct remedies based on Microsoft changing its behaviour rather than a structural remedy. </p> <p>Microsoft yesterday blamed the government's extreme stance for the breakdown of settlement talks before the judge announced his verdict earlier this month.</p>",

Microsoft will be broken into two separate companies - one to develop the Windows operating system and the other to run all other applications such as Office - under proposals filed to the US district court by the justice department and various states last night. Bill Gates, whose stake in the company he founded 25 years ago had made him until recently the world's richest man by a wide margin, would be forced to choose which company to invest in under the proposals, while other shareholders are likely to receive a share in both. The company accused the government of \"indefensible, radical and extreme\" proposals yesterday. Mr Gates said: \"Microsoft would be greatly damaged by any kind of split.\" The government's proposals, filed after the New York stock market closed last night, will be considered by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson alongside those of the company before he delivers his own verdict on an appropriate remedy later this year. Earlier this month, he ruled that the Seattle-based company had broken the law with its anti-competitive behaviour. Any break-up plan, even if agreed by the judge, is likely to be some years off because of the company's plans to appeal. However, yesterday's filing also included several tough restrictions on the company's behaviour as well as a 10-year bar on any future merger of the two separate groups. The restrictions include making Microsoft offer uniform pricing for the leading computer manufacturers as well as barring any attempt to penalise competitors who gave evidence during the trial. Joel Klein, assistant attorney general, said the restrictions \"can and should go into effect immediately\" and should last until a break-up of the company is complete. Mr Klein, who has led the government's efforts as head of the anti-trust division at the justice department, said a break-up was the best way to improve competition in the software industry. \"Under our proposals, neither the heavy hand of ongoing government regulation nor the self-interest of an entrenched monopolist will decide what is in the best interests of consumers. Consumers will be able to decide for themselves in a fair and competitive marketplace, which is the over-riding purpose of America's anti-trust laws.\" Legal experts and analysts said the plan, if backed by the judge, would be as significant as the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 or that of AT&amp;T in 1984. Mr Klein used the example of the break-up of AT&amp;T for improving competition in the telecommunications industry in the US. Bill Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington university, said: \"This case will define the rules by which dominant firms must play.\" Microsoft has already been badly damaged by the case. The company's stock market value has fallen by more than 40% since the beginning of the year when it was the world's most highly valued group. Mr Gates has seen his net worth shrink from more than $100bn to about $60bn. Janet Reno, the US attorney general, said: \"This is the right remedy at the right time to stimulate competition, promote innovation and give consumers more choice.\" Until this week, most analysts had expected the government to propose so-called conduct remedies based on Microsoft changing its behaviour rather than a structural remedy. Microsoft yesterday blamed the government's extreme stance for the breakdown of settlement talks before the judge announced his verdict earlier this month.",

Deutsche B\u00f6rse sources announced the finalisation of the deal after a meeting of the Ger man exchange's management and supervisory boards to discuss the merger negotiations. \"The plan is supported by the majority of the board members,\" one B\u00f6rse insider said. The exchanges will seek formal approval for the merger deal next week. A stock exchange spokesman in London declined to comment, saying it had nothing to add to a previ ous statement and planned no announcement today. A London-Frankfurt merger, for which preliminary talks began earlier this month, would create Europe's biggest bourse, eclipsing newly created rival Euronext, which groups together the Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels stock markets. The merged stock exchange will be based in London and will later float its shares, B\u00f6rse sources said. Blue chip stocks would be transferred to London, with growth stocks and futures situated in Frankfurt. \"The [German-listed] stocks which are traded today in euros will be traded in euros after the merger, and the same will be the case for [London-listed] shares traded in pounds. \"The long-term goal seems to be to trade all shares in euros,\" the B\u00f6rse insider said. It was not clear yet if the US Nasdaq market would be involved in the merger, but co-operation discussions are still going on. The merger of Europe's two largest exchanges would be the latest consolidation among the region's stock exchanges as electronic upstarts wait in the wings ready to claim a stake of huge and growing pan-European share trading volumes. The Frankfurt exchange's clearing system, Clearstream, will not be included in the deal and will remain responsible for growth stocks and futures based in Frankfurt.

      "bodyText": "In an increasingly violent country, Colombia's Olympic sharpshooter Bernado Tobar had few hesitations when confronted by two armed assailants. He whipped out his target pistol and killed them both. Mr Tobar, 49, who is in training for this summer's games in Sydney, was returning home from the range late on Thursday night with his wife and two children when the two men blocked the road near Jamundi, in the south-west of the country. After they pointed their guns at his family and fired at his son, Tobar grabbed his .22-calibre target pistol and shot both men, he told Columbian police. Officers later confirmed the dead men's weapons had been fired. \"We don't know if it was an abduction or if they were going to steal the car,\" Mr Tobar told a radio station. \"We had to defend ourselves and unfortunately it fell to me.\" Mr Tobar, who has been released pending an investigation, has been a consistent top-10 finisher in Olympic rapid-fire pistol shooting since 1984. The country's national sports committee has warned that the Copa America football championships, due to be held in Colombia next year, are under threat because of the violence. \u0095 At least 26 inmates died in fierce fighting between rival gangs in Modelo prison, Colombia, yesterday following clashes between paramilitaries and ordinary criminals.",

The prime minister has already declared that he will work with whoever is elected - even if allowing the former Greater London council leader back in the party may prove more difficult to swallow - and an early meeting between the two is expected. But there was no let-up in the Labour onslaught on Mr Livingstone yesterday as Gordon Brown denounced him for being \"anti-jobs and anti-business\", while the Brent East MP in turn demanded that the chancellor use his \u00a322bn mobile phone windfall to fund the modernisation of the tube. Mr Livingstone, who is anxious to encourage Labour figures to back a second preference vote for him, also faced accusations yesterday from the Tories' London spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, that those behind the anti-capitalist demonstrations planned for Monday were \"Livingstone's louts\". But Mr Livingstone called on his supporters not to join the protests because of the risk of violence and urged them to join trade union-organised events instead. Mr Dobson, meanwhile, is trying to boost his flagging campaign by becoming the first British politician to use online advertising. With adverts on sites such as thisislondon.com (the Evening Standard's website) and Capital Radio's capitalfm.com, Labour's candidate follows in the footsteps of the US presidential candidates John McCain and George W Bush, who used targeted political ads to great effect in the primaries. Mr Dobson has hired the San Francisco internet consultants Aristotle.com, who worked for both Republican candidates, to manage this phase of his online strategy. Aristotle created banner ads that successfully targeted Virginians to \"put McCain on the ballot\" by clicking and registering.

      "bodyText": "The Zimbabwean government gave ground yesterday by agreeing to allow a Commonwealth team to monitor the elections promised by the president, Robert Mugabe. A Commonwealth team is to travel to Zimbabwe as early as next week on a reconnaissance mission aimed at establishing the number of monitors that would be needed. In another move that appeared to ease the crisis, Zimbabwe's white farmers and those leading the land occupations yesterday clinched a deal which they claimed would end the violence on occupied farms but allow squatters to stay on land that has already been seized. The latest developments are typical of the bewildering speed at which Mr Mugabe engages in diplomatic manouevring: a hard uncompromising approach one day, often followed by a softer line the next. The Foreign Office urged caution on the deal struck between the white farmers and those leading the land invasion: \"Let's wait and see what happens on the ground.\" The British government's fear is that there was a large element of intimidation in the deal, with a hidden threat that the white farmers should not provide any support to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. The Foreign Office was more enthusiastic about Harare's decision to accept Commonwealth monitors. Britain had been pressing for two months for Mr Mugabe to accept European Union monitors but a Foreign Office spokesman said it would be satisfied with a Commonwealth team. Mr Mugabe has still to set an election date. He promised last month it would be held in May but that timetable now looks unlikely. Under the constitution, it has to be held by August. In African elections last year, the Commonwealth provided 23 monitors for Nigeria and 10 for both Mozambique and South Africa.

The unspoken understanding underpinning the deal is that the farmers would end their support for the MDC and not allow any MDC activity on their land. The war veterans leader, Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, blamed the violence on a \"criminal element\" among the veterans and insisted that henceforth those who committed violent acts would be dealt with severely. \"All violence must end,\" he said. \"However, veterans will stay on the farms but they will not interfere with any farming activities.\" This is the second public announcement of an agreement between squatters and farmers in just over a week.

      "body": "<p> <strong> Closure</strong><br> Under the terms of the now collapsed Alchemy deal up to 5,000 jobs, just over half the workforce, would have faced redundancy as the venture capital group moved towards concentration on the MG marque and abandoned volume production. But as the statement from BMW yesterday made clear, the closure of Longbridge is now one of the options being considered. </p> <p>If that happened the fallout for the West Midlands would be even worse than has so far been envisaged. And closing Longbridge would threaten the future of the Swindon plant, which provides body panels for models across the Rover range and which employs another 2,700 people. </p> <p>The German carmaker has said that selling the plant remains an alternative and there is a bid - from the John Towers-led Phoenix consortium - on the table on which the workers are pinning their hopes. But that is very far from a done deal while the prospects of another buyer emerging for Longbridge at this stage must be uncertain at best. </p> <p>Yet Longbridge is a key component of the West Midlands economy, which has already seen the loss of more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs since September 1998. According to the interim report of the Rover taskforce the Rover Group, which includes the plants at Swindon and Cowley, Oxfordshire, as well as Longbridge, supports some 50,000 jobs in the region. Longbridge alone supports 24,000. Nor does that figure include jobs that might go at firms tipped over the edge by the loss of Rover business. </p> <p>Rover contributes between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a31.8bn to regional gross domestic product, with, again, a big chunk coming from the big car plant. On average Longbridge workers are paid around 25% more than the average for the region - \u00a325,000 against \u00a320,000. </p> <p>But the loss of the Longbridge plant would have an incalculable impact on the local community beyond the stark economic numbers. Almost all of the plant's workforce lives within a 10-mile radius of the plant, concentrating the impact on a relatively small area, around Longbridge itself, Northfield and Bromsgrove. </p> <p>Then there is the structure of the workforce. A series of previous redundancy programmes during BMW's ownership has meant that most older workers have already left. For most of the current workforce early retirement is not an option. </p> <p>Then there is the damage to the skills base within the region. As the taskforce pointed out: \"It is already clear that other employers within the automotive sector, and from other sectors, will see major opportunities to employ skilled workers from the Rover Group and the supply chain. This can clearly be beneficial to those workers, but there will also be a tendency for those skills to 'leach away' from local communities through migration.\" </p> <p><strong> Alchemy</strong><br> For Alchemy Partners, the Rover deal is dead and buried.

      "bodyText": "Closure Under the terms of the now collapsed Alchemy deal up to 5,000 jobs, just over half the workforce, would have faced redundancy as the venture capital group moved towards concentration on the MG marque and abandoned volume production. But as the statement from BMW yesterday made clear, the closure of Longbridge is now one of the options being considered. If that happened the fallout for the West Midlands would be even worse than has so far been envisaged. And closing Longbridge would threaten the future of the Swindon plant, which provides body panels for models across the Rover range and which employs another 2,700 people. The German carmaker has said that selling the plant remains an alternative and there is a bid - from the John Towers-led Phoenix consortium - on the table on which the workers are pinning their hopes. But that is very far from a done deal while the prospects of another buyer emerging for Longbridge at this stage must be uncertain at best. Yet Longbridge is a key component of the West Midlands economy, which has already seen the loss of more than 30,000 manufacturing jobs since September 1998. According to the interim report of the Rover taskforce the Rover Group, which includes the plants at Swindon and Cowley, Oxfordshire, as well as Longbridge, supports some 50,000 jobs in the region. Longbridge alone supports 24,000. Nor does that figure include jobs that might go at firms tipped over the edge by the loss of Rover business. Rover contributes between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a31.8bn to regional gross domestic product, with, again, a big chunk coming from the big car plant. On average Longbridge workers are paid around 25% more than the average for the region - \u00a325,000 against \u00a320,000. But the loss of the Longbridge plant would have an incalculable impact on the local community beyond the stark economic numbers. Almost all of the plant's workforce lives within a 10-mile radius of the plant, concentrating the impact on a relatively small area, around Longbridge itself, Northfield and Bromsgrove. Then there is the structure of the workforce. A series of previous redundancy programmes during BMW's ownership has meant that most older workers have already left. For most of the current workforce early retirement is not an option. Then there is the damage to the skills base within the region. As the taskforce pointed out: \"It is already clear that other employers within the automotive sector, and from other sectors, will see major opportunities to employ skilled workers from the Rover Group and the supply chain. This can clearly be beneficial to those workers, but there will also be a tendency for those skills to 'leach away' from local communities through migration.\" Alchemy For Alchemy Partners, the Rover deal is dead and buried. BMW has made it clear in the bluntest possible way that it is no longer interested in doing a deal. The Alchemy view is that BMW's strategy has changed at the highest level yet again. It does not believe that the German carmaker's board would risk yet another volte face to bring Alchemy back to the negotiating table. However, the London venture capitalist firm will not be junking all its work on Rover. It believes that Rover's Longbridge plant is now doomed, if not this year then within the next couple of years. \"We will be watching the situation with interest and if an opportunity arose to do something with MG, for example, we might be interested,\" an Alchemy source said. Alchemy's now discarded plan was to turn Rover into the MG Car Company, making between 50,000 and 100,000 sports cars or sports saloons at Longbridge, with a greatly reduced workforce. Any attempt to use political pressure to persuade Alchemy to reopen negotiations with BMW would get short shrift. Ministers and Labour MPs have given the company a rough ride over its bid for Rover and deliberately encouraged others to mount a counter-bid. Money too is not an issue. The shortfall that emerged after BMW imposed its last- minute demands is far too big to be bridged by state aid, even if that was allowed under EU competition policy. If BMW had not pulled out, Alchemy's Rover deal could still have broken down. Alchemy had not yet submitted its own list of final demands. The key to the success of a venture capital firm such as Alchemy is the ability to look at deals, decide whether they are viable, and walk away if they are not. The Rover affair has raised Alchemy's profile and increased the number of propositions it is receiving. Phoenix If John Towers' group can rescue Longbridge and secure the jobs of the bulk of its 9,000-strong workforce, it will deserve its slightly grandiloquent title - the Phoenix consortium. Despite the enthusiasm of the workforce the ashes are looking a little cold. BMW has said it will look at Phoenix's bid but only after having earlier pushed it aside on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient detail on the way in which it would be financed. It said it would provide Phoenix with the financial information it has been requesting in order to tie in the bid's financial backers.Observers in Germany say BMW remains unenthusiastic about the Phoenix offer. That should not be too surprising. Mr Towers' group is planning the continuation of volume car production at Longbridge, which is one reason why the deal is popular with the workforce, but which has proved beyond the German carmaker. According to industry sources the plan is said to require up to \u00a3700m of public money, a scale of support from the public purse which the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is unlikely to countenance despite the \u00a322.5bn raised from the sale of third-generation mobile phone licences. The consortium's plan has won the enthusiastic support of the Rover workforce, local politicians, ministers and unions because it envisaged about 3,000 fewer Longbridge redundancies than the Alchemy scheme. But in private union officials recognise that Phoenix's achilles heel has always been the difficulties it would face raising the necessary finance. Although a number of the Midlands businessmen behind Phoenix are millionaires in their own right, they do not have the huge sums that will be needed to fund Rover's losses of \u00a32m a day, let alone the \u00a3500m or more needed to develop and produce a new car. The big investors and lenders needed to get the Phoenix deal off the ground will be all the more cautious now that Alchemy has failed to clinch a deal with BMW. Other options BMW's chances of selling Rover Car Operations will depend heavily on what exactly is for sale. As it stands the Longbridge plant, which was to have gone to Alchemy, is unlikely to attract the attention of the world's big-league carmakers. \"The European, American and Japanese car manufacturers already have all the [European] factories they need,\" said one observer. \"But one of the smaller Asian makers might be interested. For, say, \u00a350m they would get a manufacturing base in Europe and 1% of the European car market.\" Tata is one name that has been mentioned, although the Indian industrial group, which already includes Tetley tea, has denied any approach to BMW. Malaysia's Proton is another company that experts believe might be interested. The Rover brand name might also spark interest from outside the automotive industry, but a buyer without an existing carmaking arm could face problems - particularly if the plan were to maintain Rover as a volume carmaker. The intriguing question is where Rover's Cowley plant will fit into the equation.

With sterling now standing at euro 1.7160, around DM3.40, the exchange rate will be a key factor in the calculations of any potential buyer.",

      "bodyText": "A long and novel experience in British public life is about to reach its climax. On Thursday voters in London will become the first Britons to elect directly their own executive mayor. It is a moment campaigners for urban renewal and for local power have long dreamed of. For this is not just a breakthrough for the capital, but for the whole country. At last a big city will be able to take a direct hand in governing itself, in the form of an individual with a real mandate and transparent accountability. If the mayoralty works in London, then Britain's other great cities may follow. London is taking a step into the unknown, but it is a move this newspaper has long urged. The conventional wisdom is that this new institution has had an awkward birth. There was the agony over the Conservative nomination, as Jeffrey Archer was forced to withdraw in disgrace, and there have been serious Labour pains.

To win elections he suddenly feared he might lose, he reverted to the emotive issue of land reform, which he has consistently mishandled during 20 years in power. He sanctioned the invasion of white-owned farms by bogus \"war veterans\" and ignored court orders to halt the trespass. He encouraged violence against farmers and their black workers. These brutal, often fatal attacks have since been extended to all suspected supporters of the popular multiracial opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, in rural areas and townships.</p> <p>As part of this strategy, he has vilified his opponents as stooges of foreign pow ers, especially Britain. He has tampered with the constitution to justify land seizures, has increased police powers to suppress dissent, and intimidated independent media. He shows disdain for the rule of law and democratic pluralism. He offers no apology for the corruption, economic chaos, and military adventurism which have robbed and bled his people. And he looks down with barely concealed contempt at South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and less established regional leaders who have timidly begged him to see reason.</p> <p>Most unforgiveably of all, he has blatantly stoked the fires of racial division, describing white Zimbabweans as \"enemies of the state\". This is the kind of regressive, bigoted despotism from which, it was hoped, modern African countries had largely escaped.

      "body": "<p>The department of justice and the 19 states that brought the historic legal action against the world's largest software company believe that splitting the company into two will increase competition. </p> <p>Their case, successful to date, has rested on proving the harm done to consumers by Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly position. By forcing Microsoft to separate its Windows operating system from all other applications, the federal government believes that the company will no longer be able to bully manufacturers into taking its new products by threatening to withhold a licence for Windows. </p> <p>The government believes that the two resulting companies, dubbed Baby Bills after Microsoft founder Bill Gates, may even compete against each other. </p> <p>In addition the companies would have an incentive to develop products for rivals. What would stop the manufacturer of Office from producing software to run on the increasingly popular Linux operating system, for instance, if the company had nothing to do with one of Linux's most bitter rivals? </p> <p>Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa who has advised the government, has said: \"The role of the remedy in a case like this is not to punish Microsoft but to restore competition.\" </p> <p>Increased competition itself is proving divisive, with many Wall Street analysts denying that breaking up the company will benefit consumers. </p> <p>Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at UBS Warburg, said: \"The irony is that breaking up the company horizontally like this does not really solve any of the problems. There will still be one company with a dominant position in operating systems and one with a dominant position in the desktop publications business. It's ridiculous.\" </p> <p>Both Windows and Office, the software \"shell\" for programmes such as Excel and Outlook, are established market leaders. </p> <p>Windows has provided about 40% of Microsoft's annual revenues of $19.7bn. The two Baby Bills are also expected to share Microsoft's $21bn cash hoard, leaving them free to buy rivals unless restricted from doing so by the courts. </p> <p>Legal experts have said that the government moved towards a break-up because it did not believe other so-called conduct remedies would be effective. But Bill Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington University, said that yesterday's proposals were unlikely to end the government's involvement in the case, even if approved by the judge. </p> <p>\"A break-up will not be an antiseptic in avoiding subsequent oversight responsibility,\" he said. </p> <p>Although it will take some time for analysts to work out the ramifications of any break-up, many were turning to precedent yesterday. Since the 1890 Sherman Act on monopolies 34 companies have been broken up because of abuses. </p> <p>But the two most significant cases were the 1911 break-up of Standard Oil and the 1984 settlement with AT&amp;T which saw the telephone monopoly divided. Microsoft is considered different because there is unlikely to be a settlement and because of the nature of the fast-changing software industry. </p> <p>However, some analysts believe that the fast-changing nature of the industry is exactly what makes the government's view moot.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The department of justice and the 19 states that brought the historic legal action against the world's largest software company believe that splitting the company into two will increase competition. Their case, successful to date, has rested on proving the harm done to consumers by Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly position. By forcing Microsoft to separate its Windows operating system from all other applications, the federal government believes that the company will no longer be able to bully manufacturers into taking its new products by threatening to withhold a licence for Windows. The government believes that the two resulting companies, dubbed Baby Bills after Microsoft founder Bill Gates, may even compete against each other. In addition the companies would have an incentive to develop products for rivals. What would stop the manufacturer of Office from producing software to run on the increasingly popular Linux operating system, for instance, if the company had nothing to do with one of Linux's most bitter rivals? Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa who has advised the government, has said: \"The role of the remedy in a case like this is not to punish Microsoft but to restore competition.\" Increased competition itself is proving divisive, with many Wall Street analysts denying that breaking up the company will benefit consumers. Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at UBS Warburg, said: \"The irony is that breaking up the company horizontally like this does not really solve any of the problems. There will still be one company with a dominant position in operating systems and one with a dominant position in the desktop publications business. It's ridiculous.\" Both Windows and Office, the software \"shell\" for programmes such as Excel and Outlook, are established market leaders. Windows has provided about 40% of Microsoft's annual revenues of $19.7bn. The two Baby Bills are also expected to share Microsoft's $21bn cash hoard, leaving them free to buy rivals unless restricted from doing so by the courts. Legal experts have said that the government moved towards a break-up because it did not believe other so-called conduct remedies would be effective. But Bill Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington University, said that yesterday's proposals were unlikely to end the government's involvement in the case, even if approved by the judge. \"A break-up will not be an antiseptic in avoiding subsequent oversight responsibility,\" he said. Although it will take some time for analysts to work out the ramifications of any break-up, many were turning to precedent yesterday. Since the 1890 Sherman Act on monopolies 34 companies have been broken up because of abuses. But the two most significant cases were the 1911 break-up of Standard Oil and the 1984 settlement with AT&amp;T which saw the telephone monopoly divided. Microsoft is considered different because there is unlikely to be a settlement and because of the nature of the fast-changing software industry. However, some analysts believe that the fast-changing nature of the industry is exactly what makes the government's view moot.",

He left with a distinguished service medal, a few good-natured digs at the press, and a bag of fresh carrots sent over from the White House by Bill Clinton. The carrots were a joking reference to one of the low points of Mr Rubin's tenure, when President Clinton exploded with anger after Mr Rubin said the administration was offering \"a little carrot\" to Saddam Hussain in an effort to resolve the latest stand-off over weapons inspection in Iraq. Mr Rubin is packing his carrots and his bags and moving to London to live with his wife, CNN's British-based roving foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Married in Italy two years ago, they have just had their first baby, Darius John Rubin, born last month in Washington. Ms Amanpour was on the podium to receive her own farewell hug from her political mother-in-law. Mr Rubin's departure winds down an era in which state department policy has been expounded as much for the 24-hour news cycle as for the traditionally byzantine and discreet world of the diplomatic press corps. Yesterday the Washington Post called him Mrs Albright's \"finger-wagger-in-chief, highlighting the fact that during their time at the state department Washington has embraced a style of \"podium diplomacy\" anathema to traditionalists on both sides of the Atlantic. To the occasional consternation of domestic critics, Mr Rubin has been Washington's arch-exponent of an ethical foreign policy, especially in respect of Kosovo. His successor is Richard Boucher, who was spokesman under three of Mrs Albright's predecessors: James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher. He will hold the fort until a new new secretary of state takes over in January, after the presidential election in November.",

      "bodyText": "The Clinton administration has told the Kremlin that Russia will still be able to \"annihilate\" the United States with nuclear weapons even if it instals the \"limited\" national missile defence system which the White House wants to protect the country against attacks by \"rogue states\". The assurance, remarkable in its apocalyptic frankness, is made in a document setting out in detail the government's missile defence plans, which was presented to Russian negotiators in January and published by the New York Times yesterday. It contains seven draft protocols which Washington wants attached to the 1972 anti-ballistic-missile (ABM) treaty to allow the administration to go ahead with the limited national missile defence (NMD) system. The issue has been at the heart of three days of talks in Washington this week between the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, and US officials. Washington insists that the NMD is intended as a response only to threats from rogue states - which the state department normally lists as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya - and that it does not constitute a military challenge to the strategic balance with Russia: a view which Moscow and many other governments continue to dispute. \"The US NMD system would not be directed against Russia and would not weaken Russia's strategic deterrence potential,\" the document says. It says that even if the two countries agree to reduce their stocks of warheads to between 1,500 and 2,000, as proposed in the next phase of nuclear reductions, known as Start III, Russia will still have nothing to fear from the US missile defence programme. \"These strategic forces give each side the certain ability to carry out an annihilating counter-attack,\" it says. \"Forces of this size can easily penetrate a limited system of the type the United States is now developing.\" The American proposals would allow Washington to keep in place the ABM treaty, which Mr Ivanov said yesterday was regarded by Russia as \"a cornerstone of strategic stability\", while at the same time developing and deploy ing a missile defence system which even the US admits would contravene the existing provisions of the treaty. The US administration is pressing the Russians to set aside their anxieties about missile defence and make a limited deal with Mr Clinton rather than face the possibility that a future Republican administration would abrogate the treaty altogether and press ahead with a far more extensive system. Mr Clinton is due to travel to Moscow in early June to meet the newly elected Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and he would dearly love to be able to return with a new arms agreement. Washington's plans currently envisage building a new defence system with up to 100 missiles and their launchers, as well as new and updated radar systems. The interceptor missiles, designed to hit any hostile incoming missiles aimed at any part of the US - including Hawaii and Alaska - would be stationed on Shemya island, off Alaska, to counter an attack by North Korea. Shemya island, one of the Aleutian group, is so far west that it is one of the few parts of the United States to lie in the eastern hemisphere. It is far closer to continental Russia than to continental United States, and significantly nearer to North Korea - and China - than it is to California. Washington also wants to build a second phase, to include a further 100 missiles and launchers at a second site, to counter attacks on the US by Iraq and Iran. Negotiations on this second phase would not begin until March 2001, under a new administration in Washington, the document published yesterday says. \"The US national missile defence system, which will be limited and intended to defend against several dozen long-range missiles launched by rogue states, will be incapable of threatening Russia's strategic deterrence at the level of Start II or Start III (or later),\" the document says. \"We also propose steps to ensure Russia's confidence that the US system is in fact limited and deployed within the bounds of the agreed-upon terms of the amended ABM treaty,\" it states.",

In a petition faxed to the appeal court, Martin's solicitors claim that a fair trial was not possible because of the \"atmosphere of intimidation of both witnesses and the jury\", and that the judge failed to properly instruct the jury on several key points. Martin was jailed for life earlier this month for the murder of Fred Barras, 16, and for wounding another burglar, Brendon Fearon, 30. Details of the petition were posted on the solicitors' website yesterday. In a further development, Norfolk police denied claims by Martin's legal team that two potential witnesses had complained to the police of intimidation and death threats. A report in one newspaper yesterday claimed that two of Martin's neighbours had received death threats last autumn from people they thought to be travellers, and that as a result they had declined to give evidence. Defence solicitor Michael Ballinger said: \"One of these men was close enough to Martin to be identified, and this [the intimidation] was reported to police at the time.\" Norfolk police however rejected this claim. \"Officers close to the case received no complaints of witness intimidation at any time, prior too or since the case,\" said a source. Martin's solicitors also said that they may seek an injunction against Norwich crown court after receiving reports that court staff were discouraging trial witnesses and jurors from contacting the defence team. A court official said they had not been contacted by Martin's solicitors and declined to comment further. Earlier this week the Lord Chancellor's office said claims that jurors had been intimidated were unfounded. Despite widespread reports that jurors had felt threatened by members of the public during the trial, no complaints had been received. Publicist Max Clifford, who is acting on Martin's behalf without charge, has acknowledged that he helped stoke publicity for the farmer. Support for Martin in Norfolk is still strong, and yesterday friends and supporters of the farmer were working to fortify his home, Bleak House at Emneth Hungate. Contractors will work over the weekend fitting steel shut ters and an alarm system to the dilapidated farmhouse where Barras was killed last October. Supporters fear the house could be the target for a revenge attack, and want to ensure that if Martin is released he will still have his home. The work, costing \u00a36,000, is being funded with money raised after the verdict. A friend who visited Martin in the hospital wing at Bullingdon prison, Oxfordshire, said he was in good spirits. \"His mental state is very good but he is being kept in the hospital wing for assessment. \"Reading between the lines, it is for his own safety.\" Relatives of Fred Barras, speaking for the first time since Martin's conviction, described Martin as \"the devil\" and condemned his image as a rural hero. \"It should never have happened,\" said one family member. \"That man should have kept Fred there until the police came instead of taking the law into his own hands... It has put all Gypsies in mortal fear of going near a farm.\"",

It was one of the first suggestions he made on joining the board of Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, the unwieldy group that had sprung from the 1900 merger of 27 cement makers. </p> <p>When Critchley arrived, APCM's constituent companies were still competing against each other by selling cement under their original brand names. He recommended the adoption of a single brand - Blue Circle. </p> <p>Cement has been around for centuries. But Portland cement, so called because it was similar to Portland stone in colour, was patented by Joseph Aspdin, a secretive Leeds bricklayer, in 1824. His son's Kent cement company was part of the APCM merger. It had supplied cement to Brunel for his Thames Tunnel. </p> <p>Most of the firms which merged to form APCM were situated on the banks of the Thames and Medway rivers in Kent where the basic raw materials, chalk and clay, were readily available and where coke for the kilns could be brought in by barge. </p> <p>The driving force behind the creation of APCM was Henry Osborne O'Hagan, a colourful financier and share pusher, best known for floating tram companies, colleries and breweries. But the share sale was a disaster -not least because of a stock market panic. </p> <p>The shares fell to a fraction of the \u00a310 offer price, even though the group controlled nearly 70% of Britain's cement manufacturing capacity. </p> <p>The original 27-man board included 11 managing directors, all of whom were prepared to fight the corner of the firm they came from. </p> <p>The makers of Blue Circle cement had never been afraid to throw their weight about. The company, soon known in the trade as \"the combine\", be came involved in numerous price cartels. But its product was widely used. </p> <p>In 1906, its Gillingham plant sent cement to San Francisco to help rebuild the city after the devastating earthquake. Cement from APCM companies was used to build the Forth Bridge and the Eddystone lighthouse. </p> <p>Wartime requests for a camouflage paint led to the devel opment of Snowcem. This was followed by Sandtex, though the textured paint was improved later by taking over a superior competitor. </p> <p>When APCM was formed, the men who dug clay from the saltings and loaded it onto barges were paid 4d a ton for the backbreaking work. They were regarded as being relatively well paid. More than 70 years later the company was accused of paying below poverty line wages to black employees in South Africa. </p> <p>APCM was floated on the London stock market in 1953, becoming one of the original members of the FT 30 ordinary share index, the key market barometer until the intro duction of the FTSE 100. It became Blue Circle Industries in 1978, dropping its cumbersome title in favour of its long standing trade mark. It started to expand overseas and diversified. </p> <p>In 1994 Blue Circle returned to its north Kent roots to co-develop the Bluewater regional shopping centre, one of Europe's largest retail and leisure projects. </p> <p>Blue Circle's chances of remaining independent are now finely balanced. Lafarge increased its bid last week and secured a bridgehead by buying 20% of Blue Circle shares. The French group will be as hard to dislodge as the Allied troops on D-Day.</p>",

The makers of Blue Circle cement had never been afraid to throw their weight about. The company, soon known in the trade as \"the combine\", be came involved in numerous price cartels. But its product was widely used. In 1906, its Gillingham plant sent cement to San Francisco to help rebuild the city after the devastating earthquake. Cement from APCM companies was used to build the Forth Bridge and the Eddystone lighthouse. Wartime requests for a camouflage paint led to the devel opment of Snowcem. This was followed by Sandtex, though the textured paint was improved later by taking over a superior competitor. When APCM was formed, the men who dug clay from the saltings and loaded it onto barges were paid 4d a ton for the backbreaking work. They were regarded as being relatively well paid. More than 70 years later the company was accused of paying below poverty line wages to black employees in South Africa. APCM was floated on the London stock market in 1953, becoming one of the original members of the FT 30 ordinary share index, the key market barometer until the intro duction of the FTSE 100. It became Blue Circle Industries in 1978, dropping its cumbersome title in favour of its long standing trade mark. It started to expand overseas and diversified. In 1994 Blue Circle returned to its north Kent roots to co-develop the Bluewater regional shopping centre, one of Europe's largest retail and leisure projects. Blue Circle's chances of remaining independent are now finely balanced. Lafarge increased its bid last week and secured a bridgehead by buying 20% of Blue Circle shares. The French group will be as hard to dislodge as the Allied troops on D-Day.",

McBurnie embodied the spirit of a Trinidad and Tobago intent on promoting its own culture at a time when music, dance and drama were seen as coming from other countries. Nothing Caribbean was respected, or acknowledged.</p> <p>Born in Woodbrook, she was educated at Tranquillity Girls' Intermediate school in Trinidad, and the Trinidad teachers' training college. She began teaching, but within a couple of years realised that her overwhelming interest was in Caribbean folk dance.</p> <p>So McBurnie started saving, and, backed by her family and friends, headed for New York, where she enrolled in the Academy of Allied Arts's Evelyn Ellis School of Drama at Colombia University. There she was taught by Martha Graham - and first met Paul Robeson.</p> <p>It was the late 1930s, and she also got a Broadway job, understudying for Carmen Miranda, who was then at the peak of her fame. \"La Belle Rosette\" as McBurnie was billed, even took the Brazilian star's role for a time.</p> <p>In 1940, she returned to Trinidad and it was then that I first met her. At home, she launched a group of amateurs - civil servants, teachers and clerks - in the highly successful A Trip Through The Tropics. In those days Trinidad's folk dance and steel bands were frowned on as the stuff of the underclass. McBurnie, out on a limb, saw the recognition of the two indigenous art forms as a step towards national pride. In that spirit she went on to promote the Invaders steel band. She taught dance, but there was little money and still no fixed venue for the Little Carib. Teaching took place in open air, on the family patio, under the coconut trees.</p> <p>In 1948, the Trinidadian actor and singer Edric Connor came back from England, where plans for the Festival of Britain were taking shape. With his encouragement, she helped the Trinidad All Steel Orchestra perform at the 1951 Festival.</p> <p>In 1952, McBurnie performed in Paris, and her Little Carib company went to Puerto Rico on its first overseas tour. In 1955, it visited Jamaica as part of the island's tercentenary celebrations.</p> <p>The story of the company in those times was of small events, and many of them - but in 1957, she and the company were invited to present a lecture demonstration to a summer school in creative arts at what was then the University College of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica. It was an acknowledgement of the group's status, and led to McBurnie lecturing at universities all over the United States, laying foundations for the international acceptance of Caribbean dance.</p> <p>In 1971, McBurnie made her first trip to Britain. She was raising money to complete the building of the Little Carib Theatre. The London-based Trinidadian carnivalist Peter Minshall designed and costumed a spectacular fundraising show, which she directed, at the Commonwealth Institute.</p> <p>Back home, McBurnie enlisted the help of Trinidadian architect Colin Laird, and it was he who finally designed the Little Carib - for a song. In 1975, 27 years after Robeson's foundation stone, the theatre finally opened.</p> <p>McBurnie's dream, realised, became the focus for Trinidad's dance and drama. It was there that many of Nobel prize winner Derek Walcott's early works were premiered. He was just one of her many supporters. Another was Rex Nettleford, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies. McBurnie, he said, showed that Caribbean dance had its own inner logic, consistency and aesthetics.</p> <p>Generous, unselfish, McBurnie had a great humility of spirit. Last October, Geraldine Connor's Carnival Messiah went on at at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Based on Handel's Messiah, it married two great traditions, from Europe and the Caribbean. It was inspired, said Connor, by the work of McBurnie.</p> <p>She did not marry because she was married to the theatre.</p> <p>\u0095 Beryl McBurnie, dance pioneer, born November 2 1914; died March 30 2000</p>",

At home, she launched a group of amateurs - civil servants, teachers and clerks - in the highly successful A Trip Through The Tropics. In those days Trinidad's folk dance and steel bands were frowned on as the stuff of the underclass. McBurnie, out on a limb, saw the recognition of the two indigenous art forms as a step towards national pride. In that spirit she went on to promote the Invaders steel band. She taught dance, but there was little money and still no fixed venue for the Little Carib. Teaching took place in open air, on the family patio, under the coconut trees. In 1948, the Trinidadian actor and singer Edric Connor came back from England, where plans for the Festival of Britain were taking shape. With his encouragement, she helped the Trinidad All Steel Orchestra perform at the 1951 Festival. In 1952, McBurnie performed in Paris, and her Little Carib company went to Puerto Rico on its first overseas tour. In 1955, it visited Jamaica as part of the island's tercentenary celebrations. The story of the company in those times was of small events, and many of them - but in 1957, she and the company were invited to present a lecture demonstration to a summer school in creative arts at what was then the University College of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica. It was an acknowledgement of the group's status, and led to McBurnie lecturing at universities all over the United States, laying foundations for the international acceptance of Caribbean dance. In 1971, McBurnie made her first trip to Britain. She was raising money to complete the building of the Little Carib Theatre. The London-based Trinidadian carnivalist Peter Minshall designed and costumed a spectacular fundraising show, which she directed, at the Commonwealth Institute. Back home, McBurnie enlisted the help of Trinidadian architect Colin Laird, and it was he who finally designed the Little Carib - for a song. In 1975, 27 years after Robeson's foundation stone, the theatre finally opened. McBurnie's dream, realised, became the focus for Trinidad's dance and drama. It was there that many of Nobel prize winner Derek Walcott's early works were premiered. He was just one of her many supporters. Another was Rex Nettleford, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies. McBurnie, he said, showed that Caribbean dance had its own inner logic, consistency and aesthetics. Generous, unselfish, McBurnie had a great humility of spirit. Last October, Geraldine Connor's Carnival Messiah went on at at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Based on Handel's Messiah, it married two great traditions, from Europe and the Caribbean. It was inspired, said Connor, by the work of McBurnie. She did not marry because she was married to the theatre. \u0095 Beryl McBurnie, dance pioneer, born November 2 1914; died March 30 2000",

The man who plotted the 1985 hijacking of the American cruise ship the Achille Lauro, during which an elderly man in a wheelchair was shot dead and cast into the sea, now argues that such acts of terror are relics of a different era and best forgotten. Almost incredibly, the Israeli authorities seem to agree - up to a point. Such seismic shifts in policy tell of the changes that the last six years of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have brought about. On the face of it, the peace process is in a parlous state. But there is a strong, tacit understanding on security issues. Since 1998, no Israeli civilian has died due to an act of Palestinian terror, and Israeli security officials publicly give credit for that success to the cooperation of their Palestinian counterparts. Earlier this week, Israel's minister for internal security, Shlomo Ben Ami, signalled the dismantling of another taboo: Israel would consider releasing all Palestinian prisoners convicted of killing Israelis in terrorist attacks - specifically banned in the 1993 Oslo accords - so long as they affirm support for the peace process. \"There are no terrorists [still in jail] who have not killed Israelis so, as the process with the PLO Authority moves forward, there will be no other alternative than to release security prisoners with blood on their hands,\" he told Israel Radio. And so when the mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijacking, Mohammed Abu Abbas, landed at Gaza airport earlier this month, he sailed through the VIP channel straight past the Israeli border guards who serve as the real gate-keepers to the Palestinian Authority; an international arrest warrant, issued by the Italian authorities after he received a life sentence in absentia for the hijacking, was evidently no hindrance. \"Theoretically, any country in the world can arrest me.

Nowadays, the burly former guerrilla admits that the greatest threat to his freedom comes from the extra kilos that he is carrying on his frame, and a related heart condition. Having given up violence, he acknowledges that he has embarked on another risky enterprise. \"The conflict for the peace is very tough - tougher than war. Going forward is very slow, but we have to recognise that there is progress. \"Now even fundamentalists in Israel do not deny the right of the Palestinians to have a state. It is handcuffed, but it is still a state. This is progress,\" he says. \"Now we have to build bridges between their dreams and ours. If we can do that, it will be a blessing.\"",

      "body": "<p>So Max Bruch's First Violin Concerto fails to meet with your approval as the number one in the Classic FM Hall of Fame (Please, play something else, 26 April). He was chosen, however, by our listeners from among 70,000 different works by hundreds of different composers that we have played over the past year. Of those, the most frequently heard were in fact Debussy, Copland and Khachaturian, and not Bruch as you suggest. In fact Bruch's concerto has not been played on the station for at least the past three months. Even so, it topped our poll once again. Which just goes to show that the British public knows what it likes - and sticks to it. <br><b>Darren Henley </b><br> Managing editor, Classic FM</p> <p>\u0095 You display a distasteful form of cultural snobbery not peculiar to England, but which has been refined to a fine art by such as Andrew Clements. I am sure that a decade ago it would have been almost inconceivable to imagine appreciation of classical music managing to reach a relatively mass audience. Now Classic FM has achieved at the very least, a mass platform for the appreciation of classical music, your contributors sniff: \"Why darling, those dreadful people who vote in that poll are simply not listening to the right kind of classical music.\" In an almost laughable caricature of the this type of snobbery, Mr Clements also tells us that while Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 is an \"undeniably fine work\", his Second Concerto \"is actually a better piece\". Sniff. Sniff.</p> <p>What the poll shows is simply the enduring quality of the majority of the pieces voted for, but it is both patronising and facile to think that the tastes and preferences of those who voted and who listen to the station do not extend beyond the results of the poll. <br><b> Daniel Callaghan </b><br> London <br><a href=\"http://www.indomir@aol.com\" target=\"_new\">indomir@aol.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 In berating Classic FM's reluctance to broaden its audience's musical horizons Andrew Clements merely confirms his own prejudice. Composers (and radio stations) have, since about 1920, tried to broaden such horizons with progressively diminishing success: whether he likes it or not, the audience for contemporary music is minuscule compared to the audience for \"classical\" music.</p> <p>When contemporary composers (such as Lloyd, Arnold or Goldschmidt) dare to write \"big, succulent tunes\", complete with tonal harmonies, audiences love them for it (though such composers have not always had an representative airing in Britain). And why ever not? Perhaps composers (and critics) should have more regard for what an audience actually wants?</p> <p>The link between Shostakovitch and Rachmaninov is not so mystifying, either, in terms of chronology, tradition and of musical language: in any case, both composers concerti are arguably more meaningful than anything Boulez has written. <br><b>Dr Dalwyn Henshall </b><br> Chestfield, Kent <br><a href=\"http://dalwyn@henshalld.fsnet.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">dalwyn@henshalld.fsnet.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Clements forgets that Mozart, Beethoven, Bruch, Verdi, Gershwin et al were immensely popular in their own time because their music had an appeal which had something to do with being able to write a good tune. Well, no radio station is playing \"bleeding chunks\" from the latest operas by Mark Anthony Turnage or Harrison Birtwistle, which were both recommended enthusiastically by the critics, are they?</p> <p>It truly mystifies me why the musical establishment regard contemporary composers so highly whilst the concert-going public stay away from concerts that include such music. I've seen and heard Boulez in person; there was me and about a hundred others in a hall that could seat over 2,000. <br><b>AS Ward</b><br> Loughborough, Leics <br><a href=\"http://www.A.S.Ward@lboro.ac.uk\" target=\"_new\">A.S.Ward@lboro.ac.uk</a></p>",

He was chosen, however, by our listeners from among 70,000 different works by hundreds of different composers that we have played over the past year. Of those, the most frequently heard were in fact Debussy, Copland and Khachaturian, and not Bruch as you suggest. In fact Bruch's concerto has not been played on the station for at least the past three months. Even so, it topped our poll once again. Which just goes to show that the British public knows what it likes - and sticks to it. Darren Henley Managing editor, Classic FM \u0095 You display a distasteful form of cultural snobbery not peculiar to England, but which has been refined to a fine art by such as Andrew Clements. I am sure that a decade ago it would have been almost inconceivable to imagine appreciation of classical music managing to reach a relatively mass audience. Now Classic FM has achieved at the very least, a mass platform for the appreciation of classical music, your contributors sniff: \"Why darling, those dreadful people who vote in that poll are simply not listening to the right kind of classical music.\" In an almost laughable caricature of the this type of snobbery, Mr Clements also tells us that while Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 is an \"undeniably fine work\", his Second Concerto \"is actually a better piece\". Sniff. Sniff. What the poll shows is simply the enduring quality of the majority of the pieces voted for, but it is both patronising and facile to think that the tastes and preferences of those who voted and who listen to the station do not extend beyond the results of the poll. Daniel Callaghan London indomir@aol.com \u0095 In berating Classic FM's reluctance to broaden its audience's musical horizons Andrew Clements merely confirms his own prejudice. Composers (and radio stations) have, since about 1920, tried to broaden such horizons with progressively diminishing success: whether he likes it or not, the audience for contemporary music is minuscule compared to the audience for \"classical\" music. When contemporary composers (such as Lloyd, Arnold or Goldschmidt) dare to write \"big, succulent tunes\", complete with tonal harmonies, audiences love them for it (though such composers have not always had an representative airing in Britain). And why ever not? Perhaps composers (and critics) should have more regard for what an audience actually wants? The link between Shostakovitch and Rachmaninov is not so mystifying, either, in terms of chronology, tradition and of musical language: in any case, both composers concerti are arguably more meaningful than anything Boulez has written. Dr Dalwyn Henshall Chestfield, Kent dalwyn@henshalld.fsnet.co.uk \u0095 Andrew Clements forgets that Mozart, Beethoven, Bruch, Verdi, Gershwin et al were immensely popular in their own time because their music had an appeal which had something to do with being able to write a good tune. Well, no radio station is playing \"bleeding chunks\" from the latest operas by Mark Anthony Turnage or Harrison Birtwistle, which were both recommended enthusiastically by the critics, are they? It truly mystifies me why the musical establishment regard contemporary composers so highly whilst the concert-going public stay away from concerts that include such music. I've seen and heard Boulez in person; there was me and about a hundred others in a hall that could seat over 2,000. AS Ward Loughborough, Leics A.S.Ward@lboro.ac.uk",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence found itself pitched into another furore over inadequate equipment yesterday after the army and navy were forced to ground more than 50 Lynx helicopters because of problems with the rotor mechanism. In the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks suffered by Britain's armed forces, the MoD said it would be two years before the fleet was back to full strength, although junior defence minister Lewis Moonie insisted that only training helicopters would be affected. The Royal Navy has withdrawn 44 of its 59 Lynx helicopters, while the army has grounded eight that are used in Northern Ireland. The problem with the rotor hub - the block that holds the blades to the engine - emerged more than two years ago, after the hub on a Dutch naval helicopter fractured before take-off. A detached rotor blade severely damaged the aircraft, injuring one of the crew. GKN Westland, the company that manufactures the Lynx, issued a warning to the MoD last November, highlighting that under certain operating conditions the lifespan of the hub may be drastically reduced. Asked why the problem had not been addressed by the MoD then, a spokesman for Westland said: \"You will have to take that up with the MoD.\" Last night a spokesman for the MoD said he was unable to comment on the November warning because he was unaware of it. The Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Menzies Campbell, said: \"If a warning was in fact issued by Westland last year then the MOD has some explaining to do as to why it did not act upon it.\" Earlier Dr Moonie said that while the rotor problem was obviously a difficult situation it was not quite as bad as it sounded. \"It is not a matter of grounding helicopters,\" the junior defence minister said. \"It is a matter of sharing out the number of spare hubs we have available and fitting them on to ensure we do have enough helicopters to maintain our operational capabilities. \"We have a pool of hubs that we can share out between the Lynx helicopters of the army and the navy.

Halkyard behaved \"indecently and improperly\" in November 1994 with a patient referred to as Mr A at his Nottingham clinic, and again in November 1997 and August 1998 with another patient, Mr B, at his new surgery in Clowne, Derbyshire. It also emerged that Halkyard was convicted at Nottingham crown court in July last year of stealing up to \u00a310,000 from his surgery. He was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Halkyard, who denied serious professional misconduct, claimed that he gave both Mr A and Mr B normal examinations.",

      "body": "<p>Are you good at solving problems? Creative? A good listener and a team player? Then Susan Eisenbach has just the job for you.</p> <p>Ms Eisenbach, director of studies at the Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, knows what makes a good computer programmer. The talents she lists make it sound ready-made for a woman. But how many women are there in your IT department?</p> <p>Probably not many, perhaps none. Most startlingly, the number of women in IT has actually dropped over the past two decades. In the 60s around 50% of IT workers were female; in the 90s, despite the apparent inroads made by the equal opportunities campaign, the figure has halved and looks set to go on falling. Just 18% of IT students are female and at Manchester's UMIST, which offers one of the UK's top courses, women students comprise just 10%.</p> <p>Ironically, women started to turn away from IT at exactly the moment when PCs became more accessible. \"When I studied in the 60s, IT was too marginal to be affected by social preconceptions,\" remembers Ms Eisenbach. \"But as computers arrived in schools and homes, they fell prey to the mainstream division of labour; basically they were 'colonised' by the boys who generally see technology as their domain. Girls started to see computers as a macho pursuit: machines that boys play war games on.\"</p> <p>Her view is supported by Michelle Hawke, a 24-year-old engineer in software company Ensoft and the only woman in a 20-strong workforce. \"I went to an all-girls school,\" says Michelle, \"So I never saw it as a 'boy thing'. Consequently, I've never questioned myself as a 'techie'.\"</p> <p>Today, the shortage of women IT workers is not only an equal opportunities issue; it poses a threat to the health of an industry currently struggling with a major worldwide skills shortage. In the UK alone, the sector needs to attract 250,000 workers by 2004.</p> <p>Rebecca George, human resources partner for IBM, comments: \"The UK IT industry's failure to attract women will have serious consequences for us vis-a-vis our US competitors, who have better diversity initiatives and consequently a much broader pool of talent to draw upon.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, the lack of women extends beyond the technical domain into areas where women usually shine, such as marketing and sales, suggesting that the problem is intrinsic to the culture of the industry. In 1997, when IBM conducted a survey among its own top women executives, three issues emerged: masculine culture, lack of role models and inflexible working arrangements.</p> <p>Dr Alison Adam, senior lecturer at the department of computation at UMIST and the UK chairwoman of support network and pressure group Women into Computing, says industry should be wary of seeing this as merely a perceptual problem. \"IT is genuinely a very masculine, long-hours culture and that's what needs to change. I've watched a number of female students drop out to go into teaching because it offers more flexibility and a less macho environment; just one male student has done that.\"</p> <p>Dr Adam worked as a systems analyst before entering academia: \"I started in a manufacturing company where I was patronised and passed over for promotion.

      "bodyText": "Are you good at solving problems? Creative? A good listener and a team player? Then Susan Eisenbach has just the job for you. Ms Eisenbach, director of studies at the Department of Computing, Imperial College, London, knows what makes a good computer programmer. The talents she lists make it sound ready-made for a woman. But how many women are there in your IT department? Probably not many, perhaps none. Most startlingly, the number of women in IT has actually dropped over the past two decades. In the 60s around 50% of IT workers were female; in the 90s, despite the apparent inroads made by the equal opportunities campaign, the figure has halved and looks set to go on falling. Just 18% of IT students are female and at Manchester's UMIST, which offers one of the UK's top courses, women students comprise just 10%. Ironically, women started to turn away from IT at exactly the moment when PCs became more accessible. \"When I studied in the 60s, IT was too marginal to be affected by social preconceptions,\" remembers Ms Eisenbach. \"But as computers arrived in schools and homes, they fell prey to the mainstream division of labour; basically they were 'colonised' by the boys who generally see technology as their domain. Girls started to see computers as a macho pursuit: machines that boys play war games on.\" Her view is supported by Michelle Hawke, a 24-year-old engineer in software company Ensoft and the only woman in a 20-strong workforce. \"I went to an all-girls school,\" says Michelle, \"So I never saw it as a 'boy thing'. Consequently, I've never questioned myself as a 'techie'.\" Today, the shortage of women IT workers is not only an equal opportunities issue; it poses a threat to the health of an industry currently struggling with a major worldwide skills shortage. In the UK alone, the sector needs to attract 250,000 workers by 2004. Rebecca George, human resources partner for IBM, comments: \"The UK IT industry's failure to attract women will have serious consequences for us vis-a-vis our US competitors, who have better diversity initiatives and consequently a much broader pool of talent to draw upon.\" Interestingly, the lack of women extends beyond the technical domain into areas where women usually shine, such as marketing and sales, suggesting that the problem is intrinsic to the culture of the industry. In 1997, when IBM conducted a survey among its own top women executives, three issues emerged: masculine culture, lack of role models and inflexible working arrangements. Dr Alison Adam, senior lecturer at the department of computation at UMIST and the UK chairwoman of support network and pressure group Women into Computing, says industry should be wary of seeing this as merely a perceptual problem. \"IT is genuinely a very masculine, long-hours culture and that's what needs to change. I've watched a number of female students drop out to go into teaching because it offers more flexibility and a less macho environment; just one male student has done that.\" Dr Adam worked as a systems analyst before entering academia: \"I started in a manufacturing company where I was patronised and passed over for promotion. In a smaller firm, I was resented for my technical expertise. The crunch came when I wanted to have children and they were totally in flexible. As an academic, I'm one of few women, but I have more control over my working patterns. \"If industry wants to attract women, it's no good saying: 'We only want you because we're short of skilled labour.' Women need to be convinced of deeper initiatives: a sense that their expertise is taken seriously and a genuine recognition of work/life balance.\" But just how easy is it to work \"sensible hours\"?

She has two daughters aged 14 and 15. \"Until I came to FI, women IT managers were thin on the ground.

      "bodyText": "When Augusta Winstone was looking for her dream motorbike - a yellow Harley-Davidson Sportster - she harnessed the power of the internet to track down dealers that might be able to help her. So when she found her wheels, she thought she'd turn to the net to help her finance the purchase. Ms Winstone needed \u00a35,250 for the bike, so she surfed to see what deals were available. As she banks with Abbey National, she visited www.abbeynational.co.uk. \"It was just so easy. I did it then and there.\" She filled in her details online, submitted the form, then got an email telling her the loan application had been approved. She was then sent a hard copy of the agreement which she signed and sent back. \"The money then went into my account and I paid for the bike on Switch. \"I'm a big fan of the net. I do lots of surfing and make lots of purchases,\" adds Ms Winstone, who lives in east London and is paying back the loan over five years. Unlike some people, she is not worried about security when arranging her finances online. \"It's worked perfectly fine for me.

For example, borrowing \u00a32,000 from Lloyds TSB would incur a rate of 19.9 APR at the local branch, but only 15.8 APR at Loansdirect, its internet and phone operation (www.loan-direct.co.uk). Tesco Personal Finance (www.tesco.com/finance) the joint venture between the supermarket giant and Royal Bank of Scotland, is selling 15% of its personal loans via the internet. It sometimes offers promotional rates to online customers. \"We see it as obviously a very popular channel for customers,\" says a spokesman. However, a glance at the latest personal loans data from Moneyfacts magazine reveals that by and large, bricks win over clicks: the best deals tend to come from the more traditional lenders. For someone borrowing \u00a35,000 over three years who doesn't want to take out repayment protection insurance, Northern Rock offers the best deal: 8.8 APR, which translates into 36 monthly payments of \u00a3157.75 (a total outlay of \u00a35,679). Close behind are Lombard Direct (9.9 APR, \u00a3160.11 a month); Vivid, which is funded by Yorkshire Bank (10.5 APR, \u00a3161.39); and American Express Bank (10.7 APR, \u00a3162.10).

When looking for a personal loan it's important to shop around, as different providers come out best depending on how much you are looking to borrow. Remember that while some companies are offering more flexible products, taking out a personal loan can often mean tying yourself into paying back a large sum over quite a long time. Usually there are penalties (typically a fee of one or two months' interest) for clearing the debt early. You may find that an authorised overdraft serves your needs better.

Way to go!\" </p> <p>Female newspaper columnists, in particular, seem utterly devoted to the idea that feminism has gone down the plughole, though how much of this is sincere and how much a smart career move, is hard to say. For all columnists, cheerily reporting that we're living in the best of all possible times isn't much of a story, hence the Apocalypse-Now-(Please) tone of much of their pontificating - reminding me once again of that great line by Sparks: \"My parents say the world is cruel/I think that they prefer it cruel.\" </p> <p>Take kiss-and-sell girls; the proud existence of such young women isn't a sign of the death of feminism, but proof that even the sort of woman who once relied on the approval of men in order to make a living (ie, blonde ones with lots of teeth and silicon) would now rather humiliate and exploit men for a living instead, which can only be an improvement. Whereas once, even as recently as the 70s, they would have been silent and grateful for getting a go at the Big Guy's dick, now they are noisy and mocking, and invite television cameras to witness their triumph. These girls are not anti-feminists, but differently-abled feminists, and it ill behoves the rest of us to sneer at them; every army has a certain number of soldiers who do their best work on their backs. </p> <p>In this very paper recently, the brilliant Shane Watson thanked God she didn't have a teenage daughter, because how could she tell that daughter that she owed it to herself to make the most of her brain via education when the example of Luciana Morad - set up for life after wringing a bit of rancid sperm out of one wrinkly mulit-millionaire - is hung in front of her? Well, for a start, not many girls are as sweet and charitable as Luciana and, no matter what the pay-off, would not dream of letting Mick Jagger anywhere near them. And second, to my way of thinking, one of the many jobs of feminism is to make nasty, sexist men as angry as possible. I don't suppose Mick Jagger gives a toss how many girls go off and use their brains to get good educations and respectable jobs. But he sure as hell yelped when Miss Morad took him to the cleaners, even if he did get off with a measly \u00a312,000 a month. Case closed in favour of Private Morad. </p> <p>Similarly, the Kept Woman Look currently making itself known in the rag mags isn't an anti-feminist backlash either, but merely fashion being itself again - like with using fur - because the strain of trying to do \"integrity\" and \"intelligence\" got too much for it, bless it. The Kept Woman Look on the catwalks doesn't signify the reverse of feminist gains any more than the use of fur means that animal-rights campaigning is undergoing a reversal of fortune. If anything, they are both getting bigger and fiercer; it's just that fashion has the attention span of a gnat. </p> <p>The difference is that, generally, women are buying the Kept Woman Look with their own money, and wearing it as a sort of fancy dress; whereas in Georgian London, it emerged last week, one in eight women were actually prostitutes - a rather embarrassing fact for right-wing female commentators to deal with, one would think, considering that the sexual degradation of women was meant to have started in the 1960s. One in eight! Just imagine - that means that if Melanie Phillips, Anne Atkins, Mary Kenny, Ann Widdecombe, Janet Daley, Ruth Lea, Barbara Amiel and Jeanette Kupfermann had actually been around in the allegedly well-ordered, pre-feminist days they long for so much, then one of them would be sashaying down Ladies Miles wearing fishnets! Don't all rush at once, girls. </p> <p>It is proof of the way feminism is still devalued compared with the struggles of other oppressed groups, that we would never dream of asking whether the search for black equality was over, or the struggle for gay rights - even though both of these movements are nothing like the politically coherent, organised movements they seemed to be in the 70s. There are no more Martin Luther Kings or even Malcolm Xs; instead, there is Puff Daddy with his \"ghetto fabulous\"-ness and friendship with Donald Trump, or a variety of young black men who have made fortunes calling black women bitches and ho's for the delectation of an almost entirely white male audience. (In this, gangsta rap is just the latest twist on the old Southern plantation saying, \"A bad nigger makes a good minstrel\", just as boxing was before it. Has any group of already demonised people ever done so exactly what society expected from them as the gangstas?). The gay revolution has been similarly consumed by the desire for lifestyle above all else, and its few radical leaders firmly shut out in the wilderness; personally, I have heard Peter Tatchell slandered a hundred times - but only ever by other gay men, who consider him to be a sad, anorak-wearing party-pooper. </p> <p> The reason there may appear to be less of a women's movement than there was 30 years ago, is because people only look like a homogenous, generic, faceless mass when they are a long way down the pecking order; as women rise closer to the light of power, they will necessarily fragment and look different from each other. There is also the question of women's ridiculous level of modesty; we are brought up to be so much nicer than men that, even while going about our revolution, we will simper, \"What, this old thing? I've had it for, oh, about 90 years! It's not even mine - borrowed it off Emmeline. It looked much better on her . . .\" </p> <p>At the end of the day, animals walk on four legs, and men on three - their penises, the poor dears, will always prevent them from thinking clearly. Only women walk on two legs, and on these two legs they will one day walk the earth they have inherited from the lesser species. And on the day we inherit it, do you know what we'll say? \"A whole one, just for me ? Oh, I couldn't . You have some - go on! Help yourself!\" </p> <p>And that's why we're so damn cool.</p>",

The gay revolution has been similarly consumed by the desire for lifestyle above all else, and its few radical leaders firmly shut out in the wilderness; personally, I have heard Peter Tatchell slandered a hundred times - but only ever by other gay men, who consider him to be a sad, anorak-wearing party-pooper. The reason there may appear to be less of a women's movement than there was 30 years ago, is because people only look like a homogenous, generic, faceless mass when they are a long way down the pecking order; as women rise closer to the light of power, they will necessarily fragment and look different from each other. There is also the question of women's ridiculous level of modesty; we are brought up to be so much nicer than men that, even while going about our revolution, we will simper, \"What, this old thing? I've had it for, oh, about 90 years! It's not even mine - borrowed it off Emmeline. It looked much better on her . . .\" At the end of the day, animals walk on four legs, and men on three - their penises, the poor dears, will always prevent them from thinking clearly. Only women walk on two legs, and on these two legs they will one day walk the earth they have inherited from the lesser species. And on the day we inherit it, do you know what we'll say? \"A whole one, just for me ? Oh, I couldn't . You have some - go on! Help yourself!\" And that's why we're so damn cool.",

      "body": "<p>While crawling along the M4 on the way to the West Country for Easter, I switched on the radio in the car to find a discussion going on about the art of grandparenting. I hadn't realised that this was a subject that worried people. Grandparenthood, I had imagined, was just a state of being. I hadn't known it involved any special responsibilities or skills. But here was the distinguished ex-editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston, complaining quite seriously that none of the literature he had read on the subject contained any guidance for grandfathers about their role. There was plenty of advice for grandmothers, he said, but none for people like him. </p> <p>My wife and I happened to be on our way to stay in Somerset with our daughter, son-in-law, and their three young children, so I began to feel rather guilty that I had never thought about this problem before. But by the time Easter was over, the guilt had lifted. I really couldn't see what the role of a grandfather is except to be friendly and attentive when required. </p> <p>My main defect as a grandfather has hitherto been to demand from my grandchildren more attention than they have wanted to give; but I have tried to cure myself of this, and it seems to me that a mutually satisfactory balance has now been struck. I hope they agree. I cannot, of course, speak too highly of my grandchildren, who consist of two girls, aged five and six, and a boy, who celebrated his second birthday on Good Friday. They are affectionate, lively, original and nice-looking, which is more than one can say of lots of people. They are also humorous. After the two girls were evicted from our dining-room in London the other day for making a din during lunch, the eldest kept popping her head round the door to tell us to stop talking because we were interfering with their efforts to make a noise in the hall. That was cheeky, but funny. </p> <p>To the credit of their parents, they are not over-disciplined but are generally well-behaved all the same. They also seem to be particularly happy at the moment. I wonder if this could have anything to do with the fact that their father has banned television from their new home. At the time, I thought this a little harsh, as they had been in the habit of watching Mary Poppins on the video several times a week. I also thought it a little mannered, rather like cutting off the phone or dispensing with electric light in favour of oil lamps. But I am almost converted to the idea now. It's amazing how little you miss television if it's not there. </p> <p>I won't get rid of my own television set, because I sometimes like watching the news or current-affairs programmes, and television provides undemanding entertainment when you are tired. But then I am a grandfather, not a child. Children don't like current-affairs programmes; and when they are tired, they ought to go to bed. Children are lucky because they are spared the widespread anxieties generated by the technological revolution and the new economy. </p> <p>Despite the extraordinary expansion of the internet, there remain huge numbers of people who - whether by choice or fear or necessity - are excluded from it. This is more alarming than not having a TV set, of which the only disadvantage is that one cannot understand half of what is written in the newspapers and the magazines; and that doesn't matter very much. But estrangement from the new economy is a different kettle of fish. It means losing contact with how the world works. It can give rise to depression and even panic. Being a journalist, I have had to acquire at least some elementary knowledge of the possibilities of the internet, and I am frankly fascinated by them. But even so, I feel disorientated by the almost limitless amount of unverifiable information available online and by the suspension of traditional economic law in the dot.com universe. </p> <p> If I find it almost impossible to grasp what is going on out there, at least I am not alone. Traditional businesses do not understand it either. They desperately try to show they are on the ball by setting up online shopping or banking, but then find that their chain stores or bank branches are under threat. They seek new recruits for their internet subsidiaries, only to find that the qualified candidates are in their 20s, wear T-shirts and baseball caps, and demand not only stock options but much higher salaries than their seasoned managers in suits and ties. </p> <p>American companies such as Ford, Delta and American Airlines have resorted to giving free home computers to all of their employees in order stop the old ones feeling left out.

      "body": "<p>As I waited for Phineas to come back from a wash and brush-up, I couldn't help but eavesdrop on the conversation at the table behind me. I had noticed two elderly ladies taking up their lunchtime stations just after we had arrived, and assumed they had dropped in for their weekly catch-up on domestic news. You know, how Emily was getting on after her bladder op, what was Kenneth doing about young George, how Bill was getting on after having Marjorie put down and wasn't it awful what had happened to Florence. Instead of which I was treated to a thoroughly illuminating discussion of their e-mail and internet experiences. Blimey, I thought, the rural idyll is taking on a rather different tone in these electronic times.</p> <p>Rural is where we were, deep in deepest rural Wiltshire, to be precise. So deep, in fact, that it had taken us a good deal longer than expected to track down The Harrow Inn, parked, as it was, up a little back road away from the hustle and bustle of Little Bledwyn. The hustle and bustle of Little Bledwyn amounted to maybe one car every 20 minutes, as far as I could see. And that Tuesday, most cars happened to be mine going backwards and forwards through the village in search of The Harrow.</p> <p>Mind you, it was worth the effort. The first thing that caught my eye was the wine list, not surprisingly as Phineas and I both needed a quick refresher after our questing. The list wasn't the size of the Domesday Book, or any of that kind of nonsense. It was simply very well structured, sensibly put together, covered a surprising amount of ground, gave unusually useful information written by someone with a distinctive cast of mind, and was very reasonably priced by London standards. So a bottle of Rully Premier Cru, a serious wine with bounce and breadth, was a reasonable \u00a324. I could have drunk for less, but when you come across a fine wine at a price several cuts below the restaurant average, drink it is my view.</p> <p>With that onerous duty out of the way, I felt ready to settle back and enjoy the agreeable plainness of the room, the sturdy unadorned nature of the tables, the rather comfortable dusty ox-blood colour of the wall, the lack of frills and frou-frou. It spoke pleasantly of common sense and a concentration on the essentials, being decent grub and cheery service.</p> <p>The grub aspires to more than mere decency. Grilled scallops in their shells with ginger and chilli dressing, fried foie gras with fresh truffle dressing, confit of duck with wild mushrooms or chargrilled fillet of Aberdeen Angus complete with provenance and pedigree speak of a certain ambition; considerable ambition if the price range (first courses were \u00a36-\u00a39, main courses \u00a39-\u00a317) and the weight of fish dishes is anything to go by - 10 dishes out of a total 17.</p> <p>Phineas was seduced by a sophisticated turf'n'surf variation along the lines of seared scallops and sweetbreads with truffle dressing, which he was keen to precede with fried wild mushrooms, chorizo and spinach. I, too, fell to fish, what with fresh crab timbale and tandoori fillets with mint yoghurt, one of the two dishes of the day. The Indian influence of the tandoor aside, the chef at The Harrow clearly has a questing spirit when it comes to cooking influences, and, for the most part, the skill to pull it off. It wasn't cooking of subtlety. Slam-bang flavours seemed the order of the day, and why not?</p> <p>We won't examine the pedigree of the \"wild\" mushrooms too closely. I will only say that virtually all restaurant \"wild\" mushrooms these days have as much of the field, wood and hedgerow about them as I have. These were as \"wild\" as any, and copious with it, piled high with the spinach, spiked with lively chorizo. It's a pretty winning combination whichever way you look at it, particularly when immaculately dressed with a glittering vinaigrette.</p> <p>The crab timbale had me in its thrall, too, but then crab, if it is sweet and fresh, usually does. This may not have been the sweetest, freshest crab I've ever had, but it hadn't been mucked about with too much, came in generous supply, and still provided one of the more delicate and rewarding pleasures of life.</p> <p>I was more curious about the tandoori seafood fillets with mint yoghurt than really convinced that I would find a compelling version of such a dish in a pub in the middle of Wiltshire. Let's be truthful, you woudn't, either.</p> <p>I had to eat my thoughts and the dish because it was pretty pukka stuff. I rather doubt that there was an actual tandoor oven in the kitchen, but the spicing on each fish - sea bass, haddock and one I am not quite sure about, was distinctly clean and clear, not killing the flavours of the fish. The mint yoghurt was sharp and cool and gunky, as it should be, nicely offsetting the heat of the spice.</p> <p>The seared scallops and sweetbreads set an altogether different pace, but was equally well handled. The scallops were sweet as a nut, caramelised top and bottom and just cooked through. The sweetbreads also benefited from well-tempered heat - they are as easy to overcook as scallops. The truffle dressing was more notional than forceful in the flavour stakes, but was a nice thought, and there was enough well-defined dressing to keep Phineas happy.</p> <p>He was happy to pass on pudding and rest there, having, he told me, a formidable evening ahead, and so tackled a selection of cheeses. They were an exemplary display of very well kept examples of the British and French cheesemakers' art, a sufficiently rare experience even these days as to celebrate. I had a pudding, of which I have a keen sense of pleasure but no detailed memory whatsoever. This is probably unfair on the pudding.</p> <p>The bill was a distinctly Londonish \u00a383.20, of which booze and other non-food items accounted for some \u00a332.25. This kind of takes it out of the normal gastro-pub realms and into proper restaurant prices. The cooking justifies this. It is confident and distinctive. The wine list and service are, too. It still seems a bit on the pricey side to me, but it didn't look as if the jolly lunchers would mind that much. Of course, whether you mind is entirely up to you</p>",

      "byline": "Malcolm Gluck",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alert readers of this column over the years cannot have failed to notice a certain antipathy mixed with disdain, plus a large measure of disappoinment whenever Sancerre is mentioned. The reasons are sentimental. I discovered Sancerre in the late 60s and fell in love with its concentrated gooseberry richness and distinctive mineral tang. However, by the middle 80s, when the spectacular sauvignon blancs from Marlborough, in New Zealand, first arrived here to redefine the grape's grassy undertone, Sancerre, less concentrated than it had been, had long forfeited my affections. The exceptions were few, and are so today, though the 1998 vintage was the best for a while, and some of the 1999s might appear here in the coming months.</p> <p>In preparation for this, may I present three sauvingons from the three countries that hold out so much more excietment and good value for this grape? They are all available at Tesco, now the world s leading wine merchant (on the basis that the 150 million bottles of wine it will probably sell this year is more than any other single retailer). From New Zealand, there is Lawsons Dry Hills Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16.5 points, out of 20, \u00a37.99); from South Africa comes Firefinch Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99); from Chile there is Vina Casablanca Santa Isabel Sauvignon Blanc 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99).</p> <p>The Kiwi is immensely classy. The fruit coats the taste buds like delicate emulsion: tense, dry, mineralised, and lingering. The Cape wine has an attractive herbaceous richness, yet overall it is very dry and slightly intimidating with its compressed, stalky, under-ripe gooseberry fruit. But it is great with fish, smoked or poached, and superb with shellfish and, frankly, it is an amazing price for such class.</p> <p>The Chilean is very clotted and forward, but this relents on the finish to provide a measure of crispness. A food wine paramountly - rich scallop and sole dishes spring to mind - it is, the classicist will moan, no Sancerre. To which I am, sadly, forced to respond, 'thank heavens'.</p> <p> Tesco has a further white wine that will interest serious students of unlikely marriages. It is Nagyrede Estate Barrel Aged Pinot Grigio/Zenit 1998, from Hungary (16 points, \u00a33.99), and a surprising little throat teaser it is, being highly stylised, with rich-going-dry fruit, and a solidly engaging finish. It offers terrific price for the class, even though some might say that the Italian pinot grigio in bed with the local Hungarian grape zenit (itself a crossing of two other Magyar grapes) is a preposterous amalgamation. This chutzpah is part of its charm.</p> <p>Tesco has recently put on shelf several new reds. Winds Of Change Cabernet/Pinotage 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from South Africa, has superbly jammy richness balanced by dry, earthy tannins providing perfect quaffability. It has a savoury undertone to its exuberance, which keeps it serious, and it's just coming into selected stores now.

      "bodyText": "Alert readers of this column over the years cannot have failed to notice a certain antipathy mixed with disdain, plus a large measure of disappoinment whenever Sancerre is mentioned. The reasons are sentimental. I discovered Sancerre in the late 60s and fell in love with its concentrated gooseberry richness and distinctive mineral tang. However, by the middle 80s, when the spectacular sauvignon blancs from Marlborough, in New Zealand, first arrived here to redefine the grape's grassy undertone, Sancerre, less concentrated than it had been, had long forfeited my affections. The exceptions were few, and are so today, though the 1998 vintage was the best for a while, and some of the 1999s might appear here in the coming months. In preparation for this, may I present three sauvingons from the three countries that hold out so much more excietment and good value for this grape? They are all available at Tesco, now the world s leading wine merchant (on the basis that the 150 million bottles of wine it will probably sell this year is more than any other single retailer). From New Zealand, there is Lawsons Dry Hills Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16.5 points, out of 20, \u00a37.99); from South Africa comes Firefinch Sauvignon Blanc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99); from Chile there is Vina Casablanca Santa Isabel Sauvignon Blanc 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99). The Kiwi is immensely classy. The fruit coats the taste buds like delicate emulsion: tense, dry, mineralised, and lingering. The Cape wine has an attractive herbaceous richness, yet overall it is very dry and slightly intimidating with its compressed, stalky, under-ripe gooseberry fruit. But it is great with fish, smoked or poached, and superb with shellfish and, frankly, it is an amazing price for such class. The Chilean is very clotted and forward, but this relents on the finish to provide a measure of crispness. A food wine paramountly - rich scallop and sole dishes spring to mind - it is, the classicist will moan, no Sancerre. To which I am, sadly, forced to respond, 'thank heavens'. Tesco has a further white wine that will interest serious students of unlikely marriages. It is Nagyrede Estate Barrel Aged Pinot Grigio/Zenit 1998, from Hungary (16 points, \u00a33.99), and a surprising little throat teaser it is, being highly stylised, with rich-going-dry fruit, and a solidly engaging finish. It offers terrific price for the class, even though some might say that the Italian pinot grigio in bed with the local Hungarian grape zenit (itself a crossing of two other Magyar grapes) is a preposterous amalgamation. This chutzpah is part of its charm. Tesco has recently put on shelf several new reds. Winds Of Change Cabernet/Pinotage 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from South Africa, has superbly jammy richness balanced by dry, earthy tannins providing perfect quaffability. It has a savoury undertone to its exuberance, which keeps it serious, and it's just coming into selected stores now. Carmesi Garnacha/ Tempranillo Calatayud 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from Spain, parades great gobbets of blackcurrant and plum fruit with a summery richness of the earthy variety. Woolpunda Shiraz 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.99 until May 9), from Australia, has very cushy fruit of no little style and it is wholly without pretension. It has poise to its plummy depths, and most Tesco branches have it.

And finally at Tesco, there is La Sansoure Corbieres Reserve 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.99).

      "body": "<p>Gerald Prior - father of five grown-ups, grandfather of two toddlers, and erstwhile maker of reproduction Roman oil lamps and food bowls - greeted the arrival of the Kitchen Doctor with mild bemusement. For more years than he cares to remember, Gerald and his wife, Valerie, have had an arrangement: \"I open the wine. That's my job. My wife does the cooking.\"</p> <p>It's a division of labour they claim has worked admirably, which is just as well, because Sunday lunch at the Priors is a gargantuan affair: their record is 21 people, but most weeks they'll have nine, 10, 12 kith and kin to cater for. This regular, large-scale dining has a purpose beyond mere pandering to gluttony, however. \"Sitting down to eat together is the one way we can keep in touch,\" says Valerie. \"None of our children has a house large enough to take us all, so we always eat here!\"</p> <p>\"It's the family feast,\" adds Gerald. \"We do other things together, but not en masse . It's been said before, but a family that eats together stays together. My wife's an excellent cook, but we tend to go for roasts.\" And the family was, by popular agreement, a bit fed up with them. Cue Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, her assistant du jour, Elizabeth, and half a ton of fresh meat and veg. This particular Sunday at the Priors' Edwardian villa in Horndean, just north of Portsmouth, promised to be like no other, not least because, due to logistical factors, it was a Monday. Mere detail - on with the show.</p> <p>Last things first: dessert. \"Middle\" son Alex, 24, was seized by the KD and put to work preparing iced chocolate pudding. Within minutes, he was whisking egg whites, melting chocolate and finger-dipping as if he'd never done anything else. He assured Rosie that he worked in the electronic communications industry, but she didn't believe him. By the time his chocolate mix was ready for the freezer, a small crowd - proud mother, beaming grandmother Kitty, sleepy baby niece Becky and big sister Catherine - had gathered around him.</p> <p>Rosie took over, cackling \"Slimmer's delight!\" as she slopped big choccy dollops into a tin. Next, she moved on to the pastry for her apple tart. Again, Alex did his bit, inviting more admiration.</p> <p>Watching the KD at work in one's kitchen is a strange business. As with Rosie's other patients, Valerie was caught between a desire just to let her get on with the job and a powerful instinct to monitor goings-on very closely. \"I feel so useless,\" she said. \"I'm not used to watching in my kitchen, but I do want to watch. Normally, for Sunday dinner, I start cooking at 2pm, and it's ready around 6pm. When my mother-in-law came, before she died, we were a perfect team - I cooked and she did the washing-up.\"</p> <p>The desserts done for now, Rosie announced the next phase - \"This is called orderly baked vegetables!\" - and set about hacking the veg into cubes, laying them in regimented lines in a baking dish, and administering the last rites with olive oil and sundry herbs before consigning them to the oven. \"Bloody scrummy, isn't it?\" said Rosie, lost in a world of her own. No one could argue.</p> <p>Minds then turned to meat, and a fair-sized mass of beef and chicken (from PR Hatch Family Butchers, of nearby Cowplain) was portioned and sliced, ready for the pan. For Valerie, this was a welcome break from habit: \"My father once called me 'a good, plain cook',\" she said, laughing and rolling her eyes heavenward. \"'You always get a good, plain roast!'\" But then three-year-old Matthew, who was going through a Buzz Lightyear phase and would speak only when addressed as \"Buzz\", entered the fray. Chaos loomed, so Valerie reassumed command of her domain, and made merry with the onion, pepper, chicken and sherry.</p> <p>There was only one item of unfinished business to attend to. Still glowing from his earlier successes, Alex was singled out to make the caramel. \"Don't stir it like that!\" cautioned Rosie. \"Just watch it!\" Alex stared intently at the pan, making sure that its contents didn't catch. Minutes later, the sweet brown goo was poured into two dishes, where it suddenly set rigid, like a freeze-frame in an action movie. Chopped apple was placed on top, then covered in Alex's pastry and baked. Three-quarters of an hour later, four generations of the Prior clan gathered in the kitchen for Alex's supreme moment of glory. Gently, he flipped the tarts and . . . another triumph. Modestly, he brushed aside all praise, contenting himself with an \"it was nothing, really\" grin.</p> <p>The herby beef and chicken dishes emerged bubbling from the oven just as yet more slavering Priors arrived at the front door. To avoid being crushed in the throng, KD packed her knives and beat a retreat. One big happy family? You bet.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Braised beef with a crust</b></p> <p><b>50g butter (or beef dripping)</b></p> <p><b>3 large onions, finely sliced</b></p> <p><b>3 sticks celery, diced</b></p> <p><b>2 large carrots, finely diced</b></p> <p><b>3 cloves of garlic, finely grated</b></p> <p><b>2lb beef for braising (topside, silverside or chuck steak are best)</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp seasoned flour</b></p> <p><b>1 pint stock (beef, preferably, but chicken or veg is just as good)</b></p> <p><b>1 good glug balsamic vinegar</b></p> <p><b>1 good pinch caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>1 bouquet garni</b></p> <p><b>1 baguette, sliced</b></p> <p><b>1 small jar Dijon mustard</b></p> <p><b>A little fresh parsley, chopped</b></p> <p>Cut the beef into 2cm strips across the grain, and toss in the prepared flour. Melt half of the butter in a large, oven-proof, heavy-based pan, and gently saut\u00e9 the vegetables, along with the sugar and garlic, until nicely browned, then remove with a slotted spoon. Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2.</p> <p>Add the rest of the fat to the pan, and brown the beef all over. Once all the meat is done, return the veg to the pan, sprinkle over the rest of the flour, stir to incorporate, then pour on the vinegar, stock and enough water just to cover. Add the bouquet garni, cover the pan, and cook in the oven for two to two-and-a-half hours. Stir from time to time.</p> <p>Slice the baguette into 1cm slices on a slight diagonal, and generously spread one side with mustard. Half an hour before the end of the cooking, remove the lid from the pot, lay the bread, mustard-side down, on top of the beef, covering the whole braise, brush the top with a little butter, then sprinkle over the parsley. When the bread is crisp and golden, the dish is ready to serve.</p> <p><b>Orderly baked vegetables</b></p> <p><b>5 red onions, finely sliced</b></p> <p><b>3 red peppers, cored, deseeded and cut into quarters</b></p> <p><b>2 aubergines, cut in half lengthways and then into 1cm slices</b></p> <p><b>3 medium courgettes, cut in half lengthways and then into 1cm slices</b></p> <p><b>4 large waxy potatoes, peeled, cut in half and then into 1cm slices</b></p> <p><b>350g passata</b></p> <p><b>10 tbsp olive oil</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, crushed</b></p> <p><b>A few sprigs each of mint, parsley, basil, rosemary, roughly chopped</b></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Oil a rectangular dish, cover the bottom with onion, blob about 100g of passata randomly over the top, season generously and add six tablespoons of water. Now place tidy, overlapping lines of each veg on top. Sprinkle basil on the pepper, mint on the courgette, parsley on the aubergine and rosemary on the potatoes, then season.</p> <p>Mix the garlic into the remaining passata, season, and drizzle over the vegetables, followed by the rest of the oil. Bake for about an hour-and- a-half, basting from time to time - everything should be cooked at the same time - the aubergine will be very soft, but that doesn't matter as that makes it all the juicer. (You could cook this in the same oven as the beef, in which case it'd take about two hours.)</p> <p><b>Chicken with sherry</b></p> <p><b>1 large corn-fed chicken (2-2.25kg), jointed</b></p> <p><b>150ml olive oil</b></p> <p><b>5 Spanish onions, peeled and sliced</b></p> <p><b>4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</b></p> <p><b>2 green peppers, cored, deseeded and sliced</b></p> <p><b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p><b>375ml Oloroso sherry (or other dry, full-bodied, dark sherry)</b></p> <p><b>350ml chicken stock</b></p> <p><b>Fresh tarragon</b></p> <p><b>50g pinenuts</b></p> <p><b>50g sultanas</b></p> <p>First fry the chicken in the oil until golden-brown in colour, lift it out with a slotted spoon, then saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic and peppers in the same pan until soft. Return the meat to the pan, add the sherry, and simmer gently until it has reduced by half. Now add the stock, seasoning and a couple of sprigs of tarragon - but not too much, as it can be overpowering. Bring it all to the boil, turn the heat right down and simmer very gently until the chicken is tender. This should take about half-an-hour.</p> <p>Remove the chicken, place in a warm dish and cover. Reduce the sauce a little over a high heat, then stir in most of the pinenuts and sultanas. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle the remaining nuts and sultanas on top. Serve with the mustard-seed potatoes (below) and a green salad.</p> <p><b>Mustard-seed potatoes</b></p> <p><b>750g new potatoes</b></p> <p><b>30g grainy mustard</b></p> <p><b>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp lemon juice</b></p> <p><b>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar</b></p> <p><b>45ml olive oil</b></p> <p><b>45ml sunflower oil</b></p> <p><b>6 spring onions, chopped</b></p> <p>Wash the potatoes, cover with cold water in a pan, season with salt, and bring to the boil. Simmer until just cooked. Mix the mustard and garlic together in a jar, then stir in the lemon juice and vinegar, whisk in the oils and season. Seal the jar until the potatoes are ready. Drain the potatoes and tip them into a warm serving bowl. Give the jar of dressing a shake, pour over the potatoes, toss well, stir in the spring onions and serve immediately.</p> <p><b>French apple tart </b></p> <p>For the sweet pastry</p> <p><b> 125g plain flour</b></p> <p><b>55g butter</b></p> <p><b>55g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>2 egg yolks</b></p> <p><b>2 lemons, zested</b></p> <p>For the tart filling</p> <p><b> 85g caster sugar</b></p> <p><b>80g butter</b></p> <p><b>6 tbsp water</b></p> <p><b>5-6 eating apples (Braeburn's or Cox's English pippins are good, as their ruddy skins look lovely)</b></p> <p>Place the pastry ingredients in a blender and whizz until they just come together - over-blending will make the pastry tough. Turn out on to a work surface and knead lightly until you have a smooth dough. Leave</p> <p>to rest for at least half an hour.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Now make the caramel: place 60g sugar, 55g butter and the water in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer until it starts to change colour. Stir until the caramel becomes golden, then remove from the heat at once, and pour into the base of a tart dish. Swirl it around to get an even layer - you have to do this straight away, or the caramel will set in blobs (in the event of such a disaster, pop the set caramel in the oven for a few minutes to soften, then swirl it again).</p> <p>Core the apples, cut them into quarters, then slice quite fine. Arrange on top of the caramel, bearing in mind that the tart will be turned out - you want to make sure that the bottom row looks good, as it will be the top of the finished dish. Sprinkle with all but one tablespoon of the remaining sugar and dot with the rest of the butter. Roll out the pastry, and lay it over the apples, covering them completely. Trim the edges, and brush the top with water. Sprinkle over the last of the sugar, and bake for about 40 minutes, until the pastry is crisp. Turn out immediately, and serve with cr\u00e8me frache or Greek yoghurt.</p> <p><b> Iced chocolate pudding </b></p> <p>For the meringue</p> <p><b> 2 egg whites</b></p> <p><b>110g sugar</b></p> <p>For the pudding</p> <p><b> 125g dark chocolate, broken into smallish pieces</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp brandy</b></p> <p><b>2 tbsp water</b></p> <p><b>200ml double cream</b></p> <p><b>30g nuts (I favour hazelnuts, lightly toasted and roughly chopped)</b></p> <p>First, make the meringue. Preheat the oven to 135C/275F/gas mark 1. Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry, add half the sugar and whisk again - the mixture should become shiny. Add the rest of the sugar and whisk again. Spoon or pipe on to a greased tray, and bake for up to an hour-and-a-half, until the meringues are dried out but not brown.</p> <p>Now make the pudding. Put the chocolate, brandy and water in a pan, and melt over a gentle heat, stirring constantly. Put to one side to cool. Crush the meringues. Lightly whip the cream, fold in three-quarters of the chocolate mixture, and add meringues and nuts. Make sure everything is well incorporated, then swirl the rest of the chocolate through the mix. Pour into a lined loaf tin and freeze for three to four hours, until firm to the touch. Transfer to the fridge 10 minutes before serving.</p> <p>This is good in summer with strawberries, raspberries, etc, and in winter with a thin coffee or ginger custard.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma?

My wife does the cooking.\" It's a division of labour they claim has worked admirably, which is just as well, because Sunday lunch at the Priors is a gargantuan affair: their record is 21 people, but most weeks they'll have nine, 10, 12 kith and kin to cater for. This regular, large-scale dining has a purpose beyond mere pandering to gluttony, however. \"Sitting down to eat together is the one way we can keep in touch,\" says Valerie. \"None of our children has a house large enough to take us all, so we always eat here!\" \"It's the family feast,\" adds Gerald. \"We do other things together, but not en masse . It's been said before, but a family that eats together stays together. My wife's an excellent cook, but we tend to go for roasts.\" And the family was, by popular agreement, a bit fed up with them. Cue Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, her assistant du jour, Elizabeth, and half a ton of fresh meat and veg. This particular Sunday at the Priors' Edwardian villa in Horndean, just north of Portsmouth, promised to be like no other, not least because, due to logistical factors, it was a Monday. Mere detail - on with the show. Last things first: dessert. \"Middle\" son Alex, 24, was seized by the KD and put to work preparing iced chocolate pudding. Within minutes, he was whisking egg whites, melting chocolate and finger-dipping as if he'd never done anything else. He assured Rosie that he worked in the electronic communications industry, but she didn't believe him. By the time his chocolate mix was ready for the freezer, a small crowd - proud mother, beaming grandmother Kitty, sleepy baby niece Becky and big sister Catherine - had gathered around him. Rosie took over, cackling \"Slimmer's delight!\" as she slopped big choccy dollops into a tin. Next, she moved on to the pastry for her apple tart. Again, Alex did his bit, inviting more admiration. Watching the KD at work in one's kitchen is a strange business. As with Rosie's other patients, Valerie was caught between a desire just to let her get on with the job and a powerful instinct to monitor goings-on very closely. \"I feel so useless,\" she said. \"I'm not used to watching in my kitchen, but I do want to watch. Normally, for Sunday dinner, I start cooking at 2pm, and it's ready around 6pm. When my mother-in-law came, before she died, we were a perfect team - I cooked and she did the washing-up.\" The desserts done for now, Rosie announced the next phase - \"This is called orderly baked vegetables!\" - and set about hacking the veg into cubes, laying them in regimented lines in a baking dish, and administering the last rites with olive oil and sundry herbs before consigning them to the oven. \"Bloody scrummy, isn't it?\" said Rosie, lost in a world of her own. No one could argue. Minds then turned to meat, and a fair-sized mass of beef and chicken (from PR Hatch Family Butchers, of nearby Cowplain) was portioned and sliced, ready for the pan. For Valerie, this was a welcome break from habit: \"My father once called me 'a good, plain cook',\" she said, laughing and rolling her eyes heavenward. \"'You always get a good, plain roast!'\" But then three-year-old Matthew, who was going through a Buzz Lightyear phase and would speak only when addressed as \"Buzz\", entered the fray. Chaos loomed, so Valerie reassumed command of her domain, and made merry with the onion, pepper, chicken and sherry. There was only one item of unfinished business to attend to. Still glowing from his earlier successes, Alex was singled out to make the caramel. \"Don't stir it like that!\" cautioned Rosie. \"Just watch it!\" Alex stared intently at the pan, making sure that its contents didn't catch. Minutes later, the sweet brown goo was poured into two dishes, where it suddenly set rigid, like a freeze-frame in an action movie. Chopped apple was placed on top, then covered in Alex's pastry and baked. Three-quarters of an hour later, four generations of the Prior clan gathered in the kitchen for Alex's supreme moment of glory. Gently, he flipped the tarts and . . . another triumph. Modestly, he brushed aside all praise, contenting himself with an \"it was nothing, really\" grin. The herby beef and chicken dishes emerged bubbling from the oven just as yet more slavering Priors arrived at the front door. To avoid being crushed in the throng, KD packed her knives and beat a retreat. One big happy family? You bet. All recipes serve six. Braised beef with a crust 50g butter (or beef dripping) 3 large onions, finely sliced 3 sticks celery, diced 2 large carrots, finely diced 3 cloves of garlic, finely grated 2lb beef for braising (topside, silverside or chuck steak are best) 2 tbsp seasoned flour 1 pint stock (beef, preferably, but chicken or veg is just as good) 1 good glug balsamic vinegar 1 good pinch caster sugar Salt and pepper 1 bouquet garni 1 baguette, sliced 1 small jar Dijon mustard A little fresh parsley, chopped Cut the beef into 2cm strips across the grain, and toss in the prepared flour. Melt half of the butter in a large, oven-proof, heavy-based pan, and gently saut\u00e9 the vegetables, along with the sugar and garlic, until nicely browned, then remove with a slotted spoon. Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Add the rest of the fat to the pan, and brown the beef all over. Once all the meat is done, return the veg to the pan, sprinkle over the rest of the flour, stir to incorporate, then pour on the vinegar, stock and enough water just to cover. Add the bouquet garni, cover the pan, and cook in the oven for two to two-and-a-half hours. Stir from time to time. Slice the baguette into 1cm slices on a slight diagonal, and generously spread one side with mustard. Half an hour before the end of the cooking, remove the lid from the pot, lay the bread, mustard-side down, on top of the beef, covering the whole braise, brush the top with a little butter, then sprinkle over the parsley. When the bread is crisp and golden, the dish is ready to serve. Orderly baked vegetables 5 red onions, finely sliced 3 red peppers, cored, deseeded and cut into quarters 2 aubergines, cut in half lengthways and then into 1cm slices 3 medium courgettes, cut in half lengthways and then into 1cm slices 4 large waxy potatoes, peeled, cut in half and then into 1cm slices 350g passata 10 tbsp olive oil 2 cloves garlic, crushed A few sprigs each of mint, parsley, basil, rosemary, roughly chopped Pre-heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Oil a rectangular dish, cover the bottom with onion, blob about 100g of passata randomly over the top, season generously and add six tablespoons of water. Now place tidy, overlapping lines of each veg on top. Sprinkle basil on the pepper, mint on the courgette, parsley on the aubergine and rosemary on the potatoes, then season. Mix the garlic into the remaining passata, season, and drizzle over the vegetables, followed by the rest of the oil. Bake for about an hour-and- a-half, basting from time to time - everything should be cooked at the same time - the aubergine will be very soft, but that doesn't matter as that makes it all the juicer. (You could cook this in the same oven as the beef, in which case it'd take about two hours.) Chicken with sherry 1 large corn-fed chicken (2-2.25kg), jointed 150ml olive oil 5 Spanish onions, peeled and sliced 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 2 green peppers, cored, deseeded and sliced Salt and pepper 375ml Oloroso sherry (or other dry, full-bodied, dark sherry) 350ml chicken stock Fresh tarragon 50g pinenuts 50g sultanas First fry the chicken in the oil until golden-brown in colour, lift it out with a slotted spoon, then saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic and peppers in the same pan until soft. Return the meat to the pan, add the sherry, and simmer gently until it has reduced by half. Now add the stock, seasoning and a couple of sprigs of tarragon - but not too much, as it can be overpowering. Bring it all to the boil, turn the heat right down and simmer very gently until the chicken is tender. This should take about half-an-hour. Remove the chicken, place in a warm dish and cover. Reduce the sauce a little over a high heat, then stir in most of the pinenuts and sultanas. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle the remaining nuts and sultanas on top. Serve with the mustard-seed potatoes (below) and a green salad. Mustard-seed potatoes 750g new potatoes 30g grainy mustard 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar 45ml olive oil 45ml sunflower oil 6 spring onions, chopped Wash the potatoes, cover with cold water in a pan, season with salt, and bring to the boil. Simmer until just cooked. Mix the mustard and garlic together in a jar, then stir in the lemon juice and vinegar, whisk in the oils and season. Seal the jar until the potatoes are ready. Drain the potatoes and tip them into a warm serving bowl. Give the jar of dressing a shake, pour over the potatoes, toss well, stir in the spring onions and serve immediately. French apple tart For the sweet pastry 125g plain flour 55g butter 55g caster sugar 2 egg yolks 2 lemons, zested For the tart filling 85g caster sugar 80g butter 6 tbsp water 5-6 eating apples (Braeburn's or Cox's English pippins are good, as their ruddy skins look lovely) Place the pastry ingredients in a blender and whizz until they just come together - over-blending will make the pastry tough. Turn out on to a work surface and knead lightly until you have a smooth dough. Leave to rest for at least half an hour. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Now make the caramel: place 60g sugar, 55g butter and the water in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer until it starts to change colour. Stir until the caramel becomes golden, then remove from the heat at once, and pour into the base of a tart dish. Swirl it around to get an even layer - you have to do this straight away, or the caramel will set in blobs (in the event of such a disaster, pop the set caramel in the oven for a few minutes to soften, then swirl it again). Core the apples, cut them into quarters, then slice quite fine. Arrange on top of the caramel, bearing in mind that the tart will be turned out - you want to make sure that the bottom row looks good, as it will be the top of the finished dish. Sprinkle with all but one tablespoon of the remaining sugar and dot with the rest of the butter. Roll out the pastry, and lay it over the apples, covering them completely. Trim the edges, and brush the top with water. Sprinkle over the last of the sugar, and bake for about 40 minutes, until the pastry is crisp. Turn out immediately, and serve with cr\u00e8me frache or Greek yoghurt. Iced chocolate pudding For the meringue 2 egg whites 110g sugar For the pudding 125g dark chocolate, broken into smallish pieces 2 tbsp brandy 2 tbsp water 200ml double cream 30g nuts (I favour hazelnuts, lightly toasted and roughly chopped) First, make the meringue. Preheat the oven to 135C/275F/gas mark 1. Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff but not dry, add half the sugar and whisk again - the mixture should become shiny. Add the rest of the sugar and whisk again. Spoon or pipe on to a greased tray, and bake for up to an hour-and-a-half, until the meringues are dried out but not brown. Now make the pudding. Put the chocolate, brandy and water in a pan, and melt over a gentle heat, stirring constantly. Put to one side to cool. Crush the meringues. Lightly whip the cream, fold in three-quarters of the chocolate mixture, and add meringues and nuts. Make sure everything is well incorporated, then swirl the rest of the chocolate through the mix. Pour into a lined loaf tin and freeze for three to four hours, until firm to the touch. Transfer to the fridge 10 minutes before serving. This is good in summer with strawberries, raspberries, etc, and in winter with a thin coffee or ginger custard. \u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Perplexed by pizza, say, or just stuck in a rut?

      "trailText": "The Milan Furniture Fair is a mammoth, daunting event - but when was quantity any guarantee of quality? Luckily for Caroline Roux, the best ideas are shining as bright as ever",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Milan, April 2000. If I never see another injection-moulded polypropylene chair it will probably be too soon. Overload is, of course, what the city specialises in, from fashion to Vespas, and in April it's furniture. The Salone dei Mobili are Milan's biggest event of the year.</p> <p>What something like a furniture fair will always prove most efficiently - especially one such as this, with literally miles of aisles showing product from just about everywhere - is that there is already quite enough furniture in the world as it is, and that the very few good pieces that do exist are very hard to improve upon. How many chairs does one species need? Even taking into account different climates?</p> <p>So the task in hand is to isolate the one or two new things that really make the grade. Slip past those endless stands of 19th-century repro heavy with the smell of veneer glue and high-gloss polish, avert your eyes from the over-styled rattan beds, the marble-topped coffee tables and the mirrored wardrobes, and head for hall No20, home of the brave.</p> <p>Ron Arad is now a name designer of some reknown, and works for all the major Italian furniture manufacturers, but he has battled his way there from an uncompromising past as a maker of oversized, one-off beaten metal pieces and chairs from Rover car-seats that now fetch thousands at auction. He is braver than most.</p> <p>In Milan, his Victoria &amp; Albert range sits voluptuously on the stand of grand Italian producer Moroso (available in London from Atrium). On a white plinth under the spotlight glare is the matriarch of the range - a voluminous red sofa that is an evenly padded continuous loop curved round to leave provocative empty spaces. This is its grand launch, but from June 12 it will go on show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum as part of an Arad retrospective. Arad says it's the result of his dislike of sofas: \"They are usually big lumps, taking up a lot of floor space and air room. They are accepted as a comfortable evil.\"</p> <p>This is a piece that would fill the void in your 2,000 sq ft loft with sculptural grace. But how many average homes could accommodate it is another matter. This goes for quite a few other exhibits: modern furniture designers seem to be engaged in a competition to design the biggest sofa system, and Matthew Hilton's Converse, at the British company SCP, is another front runner. Organic and asymmetric in form, and upholstered in a sage-green fabric - very now, a sort of furniture equivalent of homeopathic remedies - the Milan version rambled squashily around a corner and could seat, maybe, eight. Next to it, veteran designer Robin Day's new sofa-cum-daybed, also for SCP, looks decidedly small, square and uptight, with its rigidly geometric shapes and perfectly formed cushions.</p> <p>Those looking for something a little less serious for a trashable bachelor loft might prefer Denis Santachiara's Swing range for Domodinamica. Hybrids have never been more fashionable in Milan (think Miu Miu shoes), and furniture follows suit. The Swing chairs, with their silver moulded plastic bases that rock back, forwards and sideways, look like the seat as trainer. They have the aesthetic of the inflatable, without that same unsettling impermanence. Living Space in N1 was showing interest, so they could find their way to London yet. And for those looking for the absurd, Philippe Starck is once again on hand to save the day. His Bubble sofa, a jokey confectition in pale lemon moulded plastic, might be making use of the very latest technology (\"Plastic sofas, a technological miracle!\" exclaims Kartell) but even at a risible \u00a3250, would you really want to give it house room? The good news, then, is that it doubles as a garden piece.</p> <p>Cappellini took over a large part of Superstudio, Fabrizio Ferri's famed and rambling photographic studios, for its display. The company is known for being just a little more relaxed than its Italian colleagues - you'd be unlikely to see something like Marcel Wanders perfectly formed sheet-metal occasional tables, photo-engraved with a map of Amsterdam, anywhere else. Or Hella Jongerius's curvy stools clad in three layers of heavy felt.</p> <p>Cappellini is also the producer of the furniture designed by British minimalist Jasper Morrison for the new Tate Gallery restaurant, at Bankside. It's a set of delicately proportioned, stackable plywood chairs in strong colours - time to chuck out the pastels for rich purples, yellows and blues - and round or square tables that seem to owe their proportions to the 50s kitchen.</p> <p>Next to these, are shiny new fibreglass chairs by the Bouroullec brothers. The two Bretons based in Paris produce designs that range from art to furniture. A freestanding bedroom, Lit Clos, reached by a ladder and looking suspiciously cage-like, borrows some of the streamlined aesthetics of post-war American design and some of the vocabulary of contemporary art. \"The idea is to have a resting place as near to your working place as possible,\" says Erwan Bouroullec. \"It's not a box, it's a personal space.\"</p> <p>I'd rather define my personal space with Procter Rihl's jewel-like screen. The London-based architects, who are producing the piece themselves, have worked in Perspex for a while, and this time they've woven it into a piece that literally glows, throwing out coloured light all around it. Slipping gently through three curves, the idea for the screen \"comes from a kaleidoscope,\" says Fernando Rihl. If you have \u00a31,600 lying around, this limited-edition piece wouldn't make a bad investment. Unlike all those polypropylene chairs, you're never going to be in danger of seeing too many of these</p> <p>\u0095 Moroso, available at Atrium, 020-7379 7288. SCP, 020-7739 1869.

      "bodyText": "Milan, April 2000. If I never see another injection-moulded polypropylene chair it will probably be too soon. Overload is, of course, what the city specialises in, from fashion to Vespas, and in April it's furniture. The Salone dei Mobili are Milan's biggest event of the year. What something like a furniture fair will always prove most efficiently - especially one such as this, with literally miles of aisles showing product from just about everywhere - is that there is already quite enough furniture in the world as it is, and that the very few good pieces that do exist are very hard to improve upon. How many chairs does one species need? Even taking into account different climates? So the task in hand is to isolate the one or two new things that really make the grade. Slip past those endless stands of 19th-century repro heavy with the smell of veneer glue and high-gloss polish, avert your eyes from the over-styled rattan beds, the marble-topped coffee tables and the mirrored wardrobes, and head for hall No20, home of the brave. Ron Arad is now a name designer of some reknown, and works for all the major Italian furniture manufacturers, but he has battled his way there from an uncompromising past as a maker of oversized, one-off beaten metal pieces and chairs from Rover car-seats that now fetch thousands at auction. He is braver than most. In Milan, his Victoria &amp; Albert range sits voluptuously on the stand of grand Italian producer Moroso (available in London from Atrium). On a white plinth under the spotlight glare is the matriarch of the range - a voluminous red sofa that is an evenly padded continuous loop curved round to leave provocative empty spaces. This is its grand launch, but from June 12 it will go on show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum as part of an Arad retrospective. Arad says it's the result of his dislike of sofas: \"They are usually big lumps, taking up a lot of floor space and air room. They are accepted as a comfortable evil.\" This is a piece that would fill the void in your 2,000 sq ft loft with sculptural grace. But how many average homes could accommodate it is another matter. This goes for quite a few other exhibits: modern furniture designers seem to be engaged in a competition to design the biggest sofa system, and Matthew Hilton's Converse, at the British company SCP, is another front runner. Organic and asymmetric in form, and upholstered in a sage-green fabric - very now, a sort of furniture equivalent of homeopathic remedies - the Milan version rambled squashily around a corner and could seat, maybe, eight. Next to it, veteran designer Robin Day's new sofa-cum-daybed, also for SCP, looks decidedly small, square and uptight, with its rigidly geometric shapes and perfectly formed cushions. Those looking for something a little less serious for a trashable bachelor loft might prefer Denis Santachiara's Swing range for Domodinamica. Hybrids have never been more fashionable in Milan (think Miu Miu shoes), and furniture follows suit. The Swing chairs, with their silver moulded plastic bases that rock back, forwards and sideways, look like the seat as trainer. They have the aesthetic of the inflatable, without that same unsettling impermanence. Living Space in N1 was showing interest, so they could find their way to London yet. And for those looking for the absurd, Philippe Starck is once again on hand to save the day. His Bubble sofa, a jokey confectition in pale lemon moulded plastic, might be making use of the very latest technology (\"Plastic sofas, a technological miracle!\" exclaims Kartell) but even at a risible \u00a3250, would you really want to give it house room? The good news, then, is that it doubles as a garden piece. Cappellini took over a large part of Superstudio, Fabrizio Ferri's famed and rambling photographic studios, for its display. The company is known for being just a little more relaxed than its Italian colleagues - you'd be unlikely to see something like Marcel Wanders perfectly formed sheet-metal occasional tables, photo-engraved with a map of Amsterdam, anywhere else. Or Hella Jongerius's curvy stools clad in three layers of heavy felt. Cappellini is also the producer of the furniture designed by British minimalist Jasper Morrison for the new Tate Gallery restaurant, at Bankside. It's a set of delicately proportioned, stackable plywood chairs in strong colours - time to chuck out the pastels for rich purples, yellows and blues - and round or square tables that seem to owe their proportions to the 50s kitchen. Next to these, are shiny new fibreglass chairs by the Bouroullec brothers. The two Bretons based in Paris produce designs that range from art to furniture. A freestanding bedroom, Lit Clos, reached by a ladder and looking suspiciously cage-like, borrows some of the streamlined aesthetics of post-war American design and some of the vocabulary of contemporary art. \"The idea is to have a resting place as near to your working place as possible,\" says Erwan Bouroullec. \"It's not a box, it's a personal space.\" I'd rather define my personal space with Procter Rihl's jewel-like screen. The London-based architects, who are producing the piece themselves, have worked in Perspex for a while, and this time they've woven it into a piece that literally glows, throwing out coloured light all around it. Slipping gently through three curves, the idea for the screen \"comes from a kaleidoscope,\" says Fernando Rihl. If you have \u00a31,600 lying around, this limited-edition piece wouldn't make a bad investment. Unlike all those polypropylene chairs, you're never going to be in danger of seeing too many of these \u0095 Moroso, available at Atrium, 020-7379 7288. SCP, 020-7739 1869.

Then there's the fact that, although each was taken in a different place - Abu Dhabi, Minehead, North Korea, Frankfurt airport, that sort of thing - you learn very little about these places from them, at least at first glance. Also odd is that Parr's expression is the same in each picture even though they were taken over a period of five years. That's not to say he looks the same in each one; in some you'd say he was in his early 30s, in others more like his 50s. (Really he's 47.)</p> <p>Oh, and one more odd thing: they're not very good. Or they're not very good if good means something that has life, or that moves you, provokes, inspires, makes you sad. A smile is probably the most they'll get out of you, possibly a laugh. Which is more than whoever took them got out of Parr - the expression he wears throughout is a nothing expression. Look in his eyes and perhaps there's a hint of a glint of knowing amusement. These are not pictures you would expect to find in an exhibition by a leading Magnum photographer. In fact, you wouldn't be best pleased if they turned up in your Snappy Snaps envelope.</p> <p>At which point some explanation is required. Whether or not they are good is beside the point. Autoportrait by Martin Parr is a celebration of studio photography from around the world. And that means studio photography in its broadest possible sense - so an automatic photo-booth counts, as does a street photographer, or just a bloke dressed as a centurion outside the Colosseum in Rome. As well as sitting for traditional portraits in a studio, Parr turned himself into a calendar, a body builder, a postcard, an astronaut, a biscuit even. And he had himself eaten by a shark. It started off just being his own little thing - he'd have his photo taken in the places he travelled to as a souvenir. But Parr has always been interested in studio photography and this was a way of collecting trophies of the remarkable studios he'd stumble across. As he started putting them together, they began to make more sense; what he has now, he says, is a collection that \"highlights the different ways we have our photo taken in different places around the world\". It's a photographer's celebration of his own trade.</p> <p>Martin Parr is best known for taking candid pictures of people, particularly British people. He takes honest pictures of real people, but pictures that make the ordinary look less ordinary. The most common criticism aimed at his work is that he's making fun, that by making his subjects look more lifelike than life itself, he makes them look ridiculous. He's been accused of sneering at both ends of the class spectrum from the safety of the middle. But if he has mocked before, he's not doing so this time. He admits they're funny at one level. \"But I'm not taking the mick - it's a very serious project, about how we have our photographs taken.\"</p> <p>So there's a reason why he's got a telephone to his ear in the picture he had done in Dhaka? \"In Bangladesh, the phone is seen as a status symbol. So you're invited to have your photograph taken talking on the telephone. You may not have one at home but it does show that you've done quite well for yourself.\"</p> <p>Each of these pictures has a story. In North Korea, he found a photographer in a square in Pyongyang. Parr was there as part of a group, so after they'd had the group shot taken he asked if he could have an individual one. They hoped to collect the photos before leaving, but at the end of the week the pictures weren't ready and they had to leave the country without them. \"The guy who organised the group does four trips a year to North Korea. So next time he went back three months later, he went to see the photographer in the square to see if he could get the photos. But the photographer had run out of photographic paper - black and white, of course. So the guy says, fair enough, next time I'll bring some black and white photographic paper. And he comes three months later with the paper. Then three months after that he finally delivers the picture.\" And here it is, carefully hand-tinted.</p> <p>Parr got his picture of himself in the square in Pyongyang 10 months after it had been taken. In Frankfurt Airport, a machine made a postcard saying \"See you soon 2000\" with a smiley face in one of the zeros sitting right on top of Parr's unsmiling face. It took about three minutes for the picture to be delivered - a picture, Parr says, that \"inspires me because it's so uninspired, so pedestrian\".</p> <p>In many of the pictures, Parr is not alone. At Butlin's in Minehead he has his arm round a tiger, at Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam it's Arnold Schwarzenegger. In Portugal he's sitting on a horse; then there's that centurion in Rome holding a sword to Parr's belly. He's demonstrating that habit of going some place, finding a familiar icon and having a picture taken in front of it. People don't want a picture of Buckingham Palace, they want a picture of themselves in front of Buckingham Palace. It's the same with the Colosseum in Rome, and if there happens to be a Roman soldier there, too, so much the better. \"This happens a lot now. People dress up in some local costume. Like if you go to Cuba and you see some old woman with a huge fat cigar in a tourist street you know that she'll charge you a dollar and you'll be the 30th person that morning to have the photograph of her.\" Instead of looking down at such practices, Parr has embraced them.</p> <p>Parr might not have taken any of these pictures but he has to call them his own work, he says.

The fact that Labour, the Guardian, the BBC and the Lib Dems were against him showed Hague was right, the Sun said on Thursday. This from a paper which begged its readers to turn out for Blair Labour in May 1997. There are two ways to win round these newspapers. Say what you think and then coax and wheedle, tossing in the odd political bribe, till they come round; or simply endorse what they say. Hague has chosen the latter. With the Martin case, as with asylum before it, it may be a squalid approach but that does not mean it won't work. And New Labour can hardly complain, given the way Blair prostrated himself before the Sun in the spring of 1997, with those pieces about how dearly he loved the pound, and how he thrilled to the very thought of St George. </p> <p>\u0095 The steam engine devised by Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) worked on the following principle.

Does he have in mind Theddlethorpe All Saints or Theddlethorpe St Helen? </p> <p><strong>Smallweed smilingly replies:</strong> Neither. For me, not least because I have never been there, the appeal of Theddlethorpe lies in the euphony of its name, which applies in equal measure to both settlements. I take the same impartial view as the railway, which established a single station for both, calling it Theddlethorpe. There are, by the same token, three Saltfleetbys: St Peter, St Clement and All Saints (where Saltfleetby is pronounced Sollerby, I believe), united by a single Saltfleetby station. </p> <p>Had the railway system not been vandalised in the middle years of the present century<a href=\"#footnote\">*</a>, I could have left King's Cross station at 8.45 yesterday morning and, by taking a train for Louth, could have been at Theddlethorpe station at 1.32pm, or at Saltfleetby by 1.37. The glory of the Theddlethorpe area, as I understand it, is the church at All Saints, locally called the cathedral of the marsh. The Shell Guide to Lincolnshire is especially pleased by the woodwork, singling out two parcloses to the north and south chapels with excitingly cursive faces - dual designs of dragons, it says, and strange faces back to back, like half moons wearing night caps with long tassels hanging down the front. What a strange and mysterious county this Lincolnshire is! There is even a Newcomen memorial in the church at Theddlethorpe All Saints, but to which Newcomen the book does not say. </p> <p><strong> Next week, perhaps:</strong> How Smallweed journeyed to Stragglethorpe, stopping off for a light ale at Strubby. </p> <p> \u0095 Why do serious publishers of serious books skimp on the indexes? Here is an entry from a book I have just been reading: </p> <p>Law, Charles Bonar. 4, 221, 275, 281, 297, 343, 381, 392-4, 399, 400, 403, 407, 412, 413 . . . and so on. There are 34 references, all undifferentiated. What is the use of that? What the reader needs is much more specific guidance, as in : birth, 4; education, 221; employed as trapeze artist, 275; fights duel with Alma-Tadema, 281. In any case, this may be the wrong Bonar Law. I was looking for the Tory prime minister, whose first name, all other reference books claim, was Andrew. </p> <p><strong>Lord J of H (Oxford University) writes:</strong> Do you have any details of Bonar Law's duel with Alma-Tadema? I can find no mention of this in any biography. </p> <p><strong>Smallweed retorts with a knowing smirk:</strong> Hushed up, I expect. I bet it was over a woman. </p> <p>\u0095 Since Smallweed's own tastes run to rugby league, I may have been wrong in suggesting that the beleaguered Metroplitan Police rugby XV could improve its chances by installing the shadow home secretary in the second row of its scrum. A more expert judgment has since arrived from Bishop Auckland, challenging this assumption. As a lock, it says (this is the technical term for second rowers), Ann Widdecombe would be required to leap effortlessly skyward, lifted by colleagues at lineouts. This may not, my correspondent suggests, be the best use of her, since \"surely her physique and unfailing and unthinking aggression make her one of nature's hookers\". </p> <p><strong>A lawyer writes:</strong> I am glad you are planning to make it clear that this term applies exclusively in the context of rugby. </p> <p><strong>Smallweed replies with appropriate genuflections:</strong> But of course. </p> <p>\u0095 My final word, addressed to all my detractors, I leave with the excellent Emerson. \"What is a weed?\" he wrote. \"A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.\" I hope he never wavered from that. </p> <p><a name=\"footnote\">*</a> Like most thinking people, Smallweed intends to remain in the 20th century till the end of this year.</p>",

Say what you think and then coax and wheedle, tossing in the odd political bribe, till they come round; or simply endorse what they say. Hague has chosen the latter. With the Martin case, as with asylum before it, it may be a squalid approach but that does not mean it won't work. And New Labour can hardly complain, given the way Blair prostrated himself before the Sun in the spring of 1997, with those pieces about how dearly he loved the pound, and how he thrilled to the very thought of St George. \u0095 The steam engine devised by Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) worked on the following principle. Water was heated and the steam thus generated passed through a tap into a cylinder. A swinging pump beam was fixed to the wall, with, on its left . . . Perplexed (Saltfleetby) writes: In recent columns Smallweed has several times referred to Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire, without ever stopping to signify the Theddlethorpe to which he is animadverting. Does he have in mind Theddlethorpe All Saints or Theddlethorpe St Helen? Smallweed smilingly replies: Neither. For me, not least because I have never been there, the appeal of Theddlethorpe lies in the euphony of its name, which applies in equal measure to both settlements. I take the same impartial view as the railway, which established a single station for both, calling it Theddlethorpe. There are, by the same token, three Saltfleetbys: St Peter, St Clement and All Saints (where Saltfleetby is pronounced Sollerby, I believe), united by a single Saltfleetby station. Had the railway system not been vandalised in the middle years of the present century*, I could have left King's Cross station at 8.45 yesterday morning and, by taking a train for Louth, could have been at Theddlethorpe station at 1.32pm, or at Saltfleetby by 1.37. The glory of the Theddlethorpe area, as I understand it, is the church at All Saints, locally called the cathedral of the marsh. The Shell Guide to Lincolnshire is especially pleased by the woodwork, singling out two parcloses to the north and south chapels with excitingly cursive faces - dual designs of dragons, it says, and strange faces back to back, like half moons wearing night caps with long tassels hanging down the front. What a strange and mysterious county this Lincolnshire is! There is even a Newcomen memorial in the church at Theddlethorpe All Saints, but to which Newcomen the book does not say. Next week, perhaps: How Smallweed journeyed to Stragglethorpe, stopping off for a light ale at Strubby. \u0095 Why do serious publishers of serious books skimp on the indexes? Here is an entry from a book I have just been reading: Law, Charles Bonar. 4, 221, 275, 281, 297, 343, 381, 392-4, 399, 400, 403, 407, 412, 413 . . . and so on. There are 34 references, all undifferentiated. What is the use of that? What the reader needs is much more specific guidance, as in : birth, 4; education, 221; employed as trapeze artist, 275; fights duel with Alma-Tadema, 281. In any case, this may be the wrong Bonar Law. I was looking for the Tory prime minister, whose first name, all other reference books claim, was Andrew. Lord J of H (Oxford University) writes: Do you have any details of Bonar Law's duel with Alma-Tadema? I can find no mention of this in any biography. Smallweed retorts with a knowing smirk: Hushed up, I expect. I bet it was over a woman. \u0095 Since Smallweed's own tastes run to rugby league, I may have been wrong in suggesting that the beleaguered Metroplitan Police rugby XV could improve its chances by installing the shadow home secretary in the second row of its scrum. A more expert judgment has since arrived from Bishop Auckland, challenging this assumption. As a lock, it says (this is the technical term for second rowers), Ann Widdecombe would be required to leap effortlessly skyward, lifted by colleagues at lineouts. This may not, my correspondent suggests, be the best use of her, since \"surely her physique and unfailing and unthinking aggression make her one of nature's hookers\". A lawyer writes: I am glad you are planning to make it clear that this term applies exclusively in the context of rugby. Smallweed replies with appropriate genuflections: But of course. \u0095 My final word, addressed to all my detractors, I leave with the excellent Emerson. \"What is a weed?\" he wrote. \"A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.\" I hope he never wavered from that. * Like most thinking people, Smallweed intends to remain in the 20th century till the end of this year.",
