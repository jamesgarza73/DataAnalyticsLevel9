A reclusive multimillionaire wants to turn the town into a Las Vegas for the north, making it a gambling mecca that would attract tourists from all over Europe and revitalise the local economy. </p> <p>Trevor Hemmings, a former builder who made his first fortune from Pontins holiday camps and is so low profile that some locals liken him to the Wizard of Oz, wants to build a series of Vegas-style casino, hotel and retail complexes on the seafront. </p> <p>He proposes to build the Pharaoh's Palace Resort, a \u00a3130m complex with an ancient Egyptian theme, 100,000 sq ft of gaming floors to be open 24 hours a day, 2,500 slot machines, 100,000 sq ft of conference and exhibition space, a 3,000 sq ft auditorium, a 500-bed hotel and extensive retail space. </p> <p>To some it is so extravagant as to be unrealistic but minister for tourism Janet Anderson was in town yesterday to hear the results of a new poll that claims 71% of locals are behind the concept and to underline that the government is taking it seriously. </p> <p>Locals say she has to. Allan Cavill, chief executive of the Blackpool Challenge Partnership, a forum representing local public and private sector interests, says GDP is the 12th lowest in the UK and the third lowest in the region. </p> <p>Unemployment in the town's four most central wards is 10% to 12%, the area is the third most deprived in the country and 6,000 homes have more than one family living in them. </p> <p>\"There are some pretty frightening social problems right behind the promenade,\" Mr Cavill said. </p> <p>\"We lost visitors throughout the 1980s and 1990s and it was probably only the slap in the face the Labour party delivered in 1998 when it said that it wouldn't hold its party conference here again until things improved that made people realise it wasn't OK.\" </p> <p>Leisure Parcs, the company that Mr Hemmings has formed in partnership with Bank of Scotland and venture capitalists Electra, believes resort casinos can be used as a tool of urban renewal in the same way as they have transformed Atlantic City and Biloxi in the US. </p> <p>Over there tax from gaming is ploughed back into the local community and into regeneration projects. </p> <p>Marc Etches, the managing director of Leisure Parcs, claims that the introduction of up to six resort casino hotels offering up to 6,000 rooms could potentially create 15,000 direct jobs, a further 10,000 ancillary jobs and gross revenues in excess of \u00a3500m. </p> <p>Leisure industry watchers believe predictions of 30m annual visitors spending \u00a32bn by 2020 are optimistic. Mr Etches disagrees. </p> <p>\"If we can get 10m visitors now when we have an off-season that runs from October to May then 30m has to be realistic if we have a year round resort,\" he said. \"Without this plan, Blackpool may be supping at the last chance saloon.\" </p> <p>Basil Newby, owner of gay nightclub chain In the Pink Leisure, warns the town's image will have to change. \"We've got a long way to go,\" he said. \"Las Vegas gets Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones.

The first requires a change to the 1968 Regulation of Gaming Act which was introduced to kick organised crime out of gambling. It restricts the way that casinos advertise, bans live entertainment, limits the number of jackpot slot machines and says casinos can only admit new members after a 24-hour \"cooling-off\" period. </p> <p>Government sources suggest an ongoing review of gaming will recommend the rules be relaxed when it reports to home secretary Jack Straw in June. </p> <p>Levying taxes locally may be more difficult, confirms a Treasury spokesman. Regional councils do not have the power to tax local businesses or ring fence where the proceeds are spent. Leisure Parcs will have to modify its proposals. </p> <p>It will also need other financial partners. The BCP is ready to commit \u00a320m of cash it won through a single regeneration budget bid, but London Clubs International, Mr Etches' commercial partner, has already had its fingers burnt by a casino venture in Las Vegas and its share price has collapsed. </p> <p>Despite the overwhelming support shown by yesterday's survey there is a growing sense of unease among local small businesses. </p> <p>Dennis Smith has been running the Abbey Hotel, a 10-bed hotel since moving from Featherstone in west Yorkshire 12 years ago. </p> <p>He is broadly in favour of casinos but fears shiny new four-star hotels offering subsidised rooms at two-star rates to encourage more gamblers could be disastrous for him and the 2,500 other small hotels in town. </p> <p>\"My business is down 70% over the past five years, the place next door has gone bankrupt twice since I've been here and, despite spending \u00a380,000 improving a property that I bought for \u00a3126,000, I've been told it is now only worth \u00a3115,000,\" Mr Smith said. \"This could be the straw that breaks me.\" </p> <p>His concerns are echoed by David Gee, the owner of Gifts Galore, who last year saw trade rise to record levels after he decided to target the stag and hen parties and stay open beyond midnight. </p> <p>\"Casinos could destroy this town and my business,\" said Mr Gee. \"The seafront will be nothing but pawn brokers and strip joints.\" </p> <p>Infrastructure will also need to be improved. Seven million people live within a one hour drive of Blackpool but car parking and rail links would not be able to cope with the volume of visitors.

And while I didn't like this play very much, his is such a quirky talent that I'd be prepared to travel quite some way to see his next one. Until April 28. Box office: 020-7229 0706.",

      "body": "<p>Karol Szymanowski was the composer who put 20th-century Poland on the musical map. He's also an acquired taste. In some respects, he's temperamentally akin to DH Lawrence: a dark, mystic sensualist who peers beneath the crumbling veneer of civilisation in search of primal, archetypal experience. His heady lyricism, swaying and unfurling rather like Lawrence's incantatory prose, is something you either can or can't take. I've always found him a tad self-indulgent. However, Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, closing a concert of Polish music with his Third Symphony, made the best possible case for Syzmanowski. </p> <p>Subtitled The Song of the Night, the Third is a setting of Sufi poetry for tenor, chorus and a colossal orchestra. Written during the first world war, it marks a turning away from contemporary events towards a world of sexual and spiritual introspection. The tenor meditates on the \"ecstasy\" of being \"alone with God\", but his ecstasy is primarily erotic, as percussive throbs and string undulations gradually build to seismic climaxes during which the chorus interject raucous, wordless cries. </p> <p>Szymanowski's orchestral palette is opulent and kaleidoscopic, an unremitting display of tone colour that owes much to Scriabin's Poem of Ecstasy and Stravinsky's Firebird, though it surpasses both in its range. Davis seemed not so much to conduct it as to fling himself into its world with delirious abandon. The choral singing was rich, if in places a bit staid. The tenor, Paul Groves, combined dreaminess with athletic virility. When it was over, I felt I needed a cold shower. </p> <p>Witold Lutosklawski admitted to feeling giddy when he heard Szymanowski's Third. His own music, composed under the communist regime and later equated with the voice of Solidarity, inhabits an altogether different terrain, that of the artist searching for individuality in the face of totalitarianism. </p> <p>The Concerto for Orchestra was the work that made him both a national and international success in 1954. Its brilliance is deceptive, compounded of a folksy melodic and rhythmic drive and dissident atonal harmonies. Davis couldn't quite disguise the fact that the closing passacaglia goes on too long, though the opening movement, in which a defiant, lurching theme ricochets from the depths of the orchestra to its heights, was electrifying. </p> <p>In between came Chopin's Second Piano Concerto, with Maria Joao Pires as soloist. She defies criticism in this music, probing it with the combination of supreme intelligence and emotional spontaneity that is uniquely her own. In the slow movement, the audience held its breath as the slow cascade of sound unfurled with perfect limpidity. </p> <p>Chopin's orchestration has often been criticised as weak. Davis avoided the usual tendency to make it sound as if it was written by someone else (many conductors shade it towards Brahms), unearthing some beautiful woodwind and brass sonorities in the process. The BBCSO's playing had a ferocious energy throughout the evening, communicating the orchestra's almost tangible delight at having its former chief conductor back.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Thus far, 2001 has proved a difficult year for the music festival. First Glastonbury was cancelled amid fears over crowd control, then the spectre of foot and mouth cast doubts over every summer event in a pastoral setting. Yet, in the windswept and unlovely environs of a south-coast branch of Pontins, one festival at least is thriving. Now in its third sold-out year, All Tomorrow's Parties serves up three days of alternative music, crazy golf and cramped chalet-living to a 3,000-strong crowd. </p> <p>Even to the seasoned festival-goer, All Tomorrow's Parties is an anomalous event, as distant from the star-studded stages and corporate hospitality of a major rock festival as Camber Sands's grey coastline is from the bucolic majesty of Michael Eavis's farm. It is the anti-Glastonbury, where nobody is on drugs, nobody is covered in mud and nobody is hosting a free didgeridoo workshop or having their chakras realigned in a \"healing space\". </p> <p>The bands playing are so wilfully esoteric and uncommercial as to make the average Glastonbury look like Live Aid. \"Curated\" by Chicago \"post-rock\" sextet Tortoise, All Tomorrow's Parties is a parallel musical universe: here no one raises an eyebrow at the Sun Ra Solar Arkestra playing woozy, exploratory jazz while wearing extravagantly sequinned turbans, and people actually dance to the atonal, ear-rupturing racket generated by freeform guitarist Derek Bailey. </p> <p>In the festival's sole concession to a newsworthy commercialism, Tortoise have persuaded Television - the brainy New York punks whose 1977 album Marquee Moon remains an art-rock benchmark - to reform. Bearing in mind that Television's influence far outweighs their record sales, their surprise appearance is unlikely to oust Hear'Say from the tabloid headlines. </p> <p>Tortoise themselves embody the festival's uncompromising spirit - their four albums of rambling guitar instrumentals influenced Radiohead's audience-baiting Kid A - and their Friday-night set demonstrates both the advantages and drawbacks of ignoring rock music's rulebook. They display breathtaking musical range, shifting from cocktail jazz to dub reggae to filmic atmospherics, frequently within the space of one track, but they are stymied by an alarming self-indulgence (their love of the extended xylophone solo would test even Patrick Moore's patience) and a complete absence of stage presence. </p> <p>Live, Tortoise's furrowed brows and static postures suggest men conducting a particularly tricky chemistry experiment. The audience respond in kind. When Tortoise play Monica, a lithe sliver of Curtis Mayfield-influenced funk from their recent album Standards, nobody moves. By the end of the set, at least four members of the crowd are lying prone at the rear of the grandly named Stardust Ballroom. They are fast asleep. </p> <p>However, Tortoise's problems with stagecraft are minimal compared with those of Saturday-night headliners Boards of Canada. The appearance of the mysterious Scots techno duo is a surprise as they rarely play live, and their performance displays a recalcitrance that suits a band who make their records in a disused nuclear bunker. The stage is so dark, it is virtually impossible to see what's going on. Two bearded figures are occasionally visible, mournfully prodding synthesisers. Grim public information films flicker on an overhead screen and melancholy, distended bleeping fills the air. The effect is intended to be atmospheric and sinister, but Boards of Canada are so remote from their audience that they cannot generate any atmosphere or transcend their surroundings. And when your surroundings are the tatty ballroom of an off-season holiday camp, this is a major problem. </p> <p>Abstract techno, free jazz and post-rock are not genres generally noted for their sense of humour and, over three days, the high seriousness with which many bands perform becomes rather wearing. Alt-country collective Lambchop provide welcome light relief with a tongue-in-cheek encore of the Sisters of Mercy's overblown goth anthem This Corrosion. Even better is Sunday's set from veteran New York trio Yo La Tengo, which intersperses raging guitar noise with gently introverted pop songs and a wisecracking wit. The sense of relief when singer Ira Kaplan throws his guitar down mid-song, or chucklingly accepts a shouted request, is almost palpable: at last a band interacting with the audience, rather than playing at them. </p> <p>If Television's entrance bodes badly - they spend 15 minutes tuning up - the band soon ignite. The strained relations among the quartet are legendary and the atmosphere onstage is distinctly frosty, but this only seems to spur guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd on. </p> <p>Television have the receding hairlines and paunches of men in their 40s, yet play with a visceral passion lacking in much of the weekend. But they are from another era: in these corporate-sponsored times, it seems that some bands outside the mainstream confuse commercial appeal with the desire to entertain, and steadfastly refuse to indulge in either. A pity, particularly if you're in the audience.</p>",

The bands playing are so wilfully esoteric and uncommercial as to make the average Glastonbury look like Live Aid. \"Curated\" by Chicago \"post-rock\" sextet Tortoise, All Tomorrow's Parties is a parallel musical universe: here no one raises an eyebrow at the Sun Ra Solar Arkestra playing woozy, exploratory jazz while wearing extravagantly sequinned turbans, and people actually dance to the atonal, ear-rupturing racket generated by freeform guitarist Derek Bailey. In the festival's sole concession to a newsworthy commercialism, Tortoise have persuaded Television - the brainy New York punks whose 1977 album Marquee Moon remains an art-rock benchmark - to reform. Bearing in mind that Television's influence far outweighs their record sales, their surprise appearance is unlikely to oust Hear'Say from the tabloid headlines. Tortoise themselves embody the festival's uncompromising spirit - their four albums of rambling guitar instrumentals influenced Radiohead's audience-baiting Kid A - and their Friday-night set demonstrates both the advantages and drawbacks of ignoring rock music's rulebook. They display breathtaking musical range, shifting from cocktail jazz to dub reggae to filmic atmospherics, frequently within the space of one track, but they are stymied by an alarming self-indulgence (their love of the extended xylophone solo would test even Patrick Moore's patience) and a complete absence of stage presence. Live, Tortoise's furrowed brows and static postures suggest men conducting a particularly tricky chemistry experiment. The audience respond in kind. When Tortoise play Monica, a lithe sliver of Curtis Mayfield-influenced funk from their recent album Standards, nobody moves. By the end of the set, at least four members of the crowd are lying prone at the rear of the grandly named Stardust Ballroom. They are fast asleep. However, Tortoise's problems with stagecraft are minimal compared with those of Saturday-night headliners Boards of Canada. The appearance of the mysterious Scots techno duo is a surprise as they rarely play live, and their performance displays a recalcitrance that suits a band who make their records in a disused nuclear bunker. The stage is so dark, it is virtually impossible to see what's going on. Two bearded figures are occasionally visible, mournfully prodding synthesisers. Grim public information films flicker on an overhead screen and melancholy, distended bleeping fills the air. The effect is intended to be atmospheric and sinister, but Boards of Canada are so remote from their audience that they cannot generate any atmosphere or transcend their surroundings. And when your surroundings are the tatty ballroom of an off-season holiday camp, this is a major problem. Abstract techno, free jazz and post-rock are not genres generally noted for their sense of humour and, over three days, the high seriousness with which many bands perform becomes rather wearing. Alt-country collective Lambchop provide welcome light relief with a tongue-in-cheek encore of the Sisters of Mercy's overblown goth anthem This Corrosion. Even better is Sunday's set from veteran New York trio Yo La Tengo, which intersperses raging guitar noise with gently introverted pop songs and a wisecracking wit. The sense of relief when singer Ira Kaplan throws his guitar down mid-song, or chucklingly accepts a shouted request, is almost palpable: at last a band interacting with the audience, rather than playing at them. If Television's entrance bodes badly - they spend 15 minutes tuning up - the band soon ignite. The strained relations among the quartet are legendary and the atmosphere onstage is distinctly frosty, but this only seems to spur guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd on. Television have the receding hairlines and paunches of men in their 40s, yet play with a visceral passion lacking in much of the weekend. But they are from another era: in these corporate-sponsored times, it seems that some bands outside the mainstream confuse commercial appeal with the desire to entertain, and steadfastly refuse to indulge in either. A pity, particularly if you're in the audience.",

Clark's body seemed to have been programmed to create nothing but lustrous shapes, and he had the face of an angel. Akram Khan, 26-year-old dancer of Kathak and modern dance, may be built in a different mould - bigger, darker and more majestic than Clark - but he possesses the same magic on stage. </p> <p>Polaroid Feet, Khan's current show, is the first I've seen in which he presents a full solo evening of Kathak, and it's a pure showcase for his gifts. Even a first-time viewer of Kathak would guess Khan to be a virtuoso. In the fast weighted turns that are special to the style, he achieves a heady contradiction of precise physical detail preserved within a blur of speed. In the intricacies of Kathak footwork, Khan's feet seem to call on more joints and muscles than is humanly possible as he refracts choreographic rhythm into the most delicate of tremors and the most thrilling of percussive stamps. </p> <p>But it is Khan's upper body, and especially his face, that hold the key to his uniqueness. His torso has a strength and elasticity that allow him to arch, dip and spiral with extravagant grace; his broad arms are as opulent as a ballerina's; and while there is nothing archaic or precious about his face, its expressive range in performance is rapt, fierce and joyous by turns. His control is such that he can brake from passages of vertiginous speed into a monumental stillness that makes the stage hold its breath. </p> <p>Two hours of one man dancing may seem a tough call for an audience but the programme feels varied. The first half, I guess, inspires the title Polaroid Feet, for it is the section in which Khan and his four musicians improvise mathematical variations within a 16-count cycle, which Khan then develops into instant snapshots of dance. These show off not only Khan's inventiveness but also the exemplary talents of his band. The tabla player in particular, Vishnu Sahai, is blinding, producing drumming of such complexity that it sounds like the work of several musicians. </p> <p>This is followed by a narrative dance in which Khan not only articulates, with startling expressiveness, a dialogue between the gods Shiva and Parvati, but also manages to balance within his body the physical power and delicacy of each. The closing dance (choreographed by Khan's guru, Sri Pratap Pawar) is a return to pure virtuosity. At this point, after nearly two hours, Khan has reached the kind of high where, as a dancer, he has become inseparable from the dance. His body, brain and heart are all running free. Even though he's dripping, he looks as if he could continue half the night. And most of us would happily stay and watch. </p> <p> Ends tonight. Box office: 020-7960 4242.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Celtic celebrated Scottish championship victory on Saturday as if it were their first title in ages when, in fact, it was only two seasons ago that they last performed the feat.</p> <p>Back then, the celebrations were muted by brooding anticipation, confirmed when Wim Jansen left the club, and the acrimony surrounding the manager's departure was only accentuated by the difficulties in recruiting his successor.</p> <p>That the next Celtic manager should happen to be the highly respected Dr Jozef Venglos was a tribute to the club's powers of persuasion. But the stop-gap nature of the appointment underlined an uncomfortable fact - the notion of Celtic being a world power was simply a delusion. </p> <p>Two ordinary European campaigns since are further corroboration. Celtic may have been the first British club to win the European Cup, but that was in 1967, well over 30 years ago. As the title celebrations ebb, it is towards Europe that Martin O'Neill will be looking. Before and in the immediate wake of the slender, at times nervous, 1-0 win over St Mirren, he was insisting that his side are far from the finished article. </p> <p>\"It was as satisfying a moment as I've ever had,\" said O'Neill about the championship victory. \"I certainly do not want to diminish anything else I've done. When I was at Wycombe Wanderers and we won the Vauxhall Conference I thought it was the greatest moment on earth. It didn't matter whether Real Madrid were winning the European Cup on the same night. But we've won a championship here in what has been a long season. </p> <p>\"It started on the last Sunday of July and the culmination is here. We have played in all sorts of weather and conditions and we have had all sorts of performances too. But to win 28 out of 33 games is incredible.</p> <p>\"We'll have to improve. The nucleus of the side is strong and will deal with European football. But I don't have enough on the periphery. We need a bigger and better squad.\"</p> <p>The surprise would be the board refusing to furnish him with at least some money to strengthen the squad. After all, there is not only Europe to think about but the likely re-emergence of their Old Firm rivals, Rangers. </p> <p>\"Rangers will come roaring back with a vengeance,\" said O'Neill. \"Could you tell [owner] David Murray not to produce any more money? I'm of the belief they have a lot of talented footballers. They were a point away from qualifying for the second stage of the Champions League. They will be massively disappointed. I expect Rangers not to take this lying down.\" </p> <p>Hard cash is not, however, the stuff of legends. Of all the attractions of being at Celtic, the possibility of becoming a legend must figure highly in O'Neill's mind. In which case, he may be inclined to build steadily rather than risk failing wildly with someone else's money. That is why the celebrations at Celtic Park were so uninhibited on Saturday. This was not a chequebook victory. Integrity remained intact.</p> <p>Understandably, O'Neill's name is being linked to the manager's job at Manchester United, which falls vacant when Sir Alex Ferguson's contract expires next year. He is, after all, just a Tennent's Scottish Cup win away from a domestic treble. Imagine, though, if O'Neill were to take over from Ferguson. Even if he were to win another Champions Cup - a tall order in a hard act to follow - he could end up no more than a keeper of the flame. </p> <p>It is a happy coincidence that the championship should be won during the same weekend as the US Masters.

      "bodyText": "Celtic celebrated Scottish championship victory on Saturday as if it were their first title in ages when, in fact, it was only two seasons ago that they last performed the feat. Back then, the celebrations were muted by brooding anticipation, confirmed when Wim Jansen left the club, and the acrimony surrounding the manager's departure was only accentuated by the difficulties in recruiting his successor. That the next Celtic manager should happen to be the highly respected Dr Jozef Venglos was a tribute to the club's powers of persuasion. But the stop-gap nature of the appointment underlined an uncomfortable fact - the notion of Celtic being a world power was simply a delusion. Two ordinary European campaigns since are further corroboration. Celtic may have been the first British club to win the European Cup, but that was in 1967, well over 30 years ago. As the title celebrations ebb, it is towards Europe that Martin O'Neill will be looking. Before and in the immediate wake of the slender, at times nervous, 1-0 win over St Mirren, he was insisting that his side are far from the finished article. \"It was as satisfying a moment as I've ever had,\" said O'Neill about the championship victory. \"I certainly do not want to diminish anything else I've done. When I was at Wycombe Wanderers and we won the Vauxhall Conference I thought it was the greatest moment on earth. It didn't matter whether Real Madrid were winning the European Cup on the same night. But we've won a championship here in what has been a long season. \"It started on the last Sunday of July and the culmination is here. We have played in all sorts of weather and conditions and we have had all sorts of performances too. But to win 28 out of 33 games is incredible. \"We'll have to improve. The nucleus of the side is strong and will deal with European football. But I don't have enough on the periphery. We need a bigger and better squad.\" The surprise would be the board refusing to furnish him with at least some money to strengthen the squad. After all, there is not only Europe to think about but the likely re-emergence of their Old Firm rivals, Rangers. \"Rangers will come roaring back with a vengeance,\" said O'Neill. \"Could you tell [owner] David Murray not to produce any more money? I'm of the belief they have a lot of talented footballers. They were a point away from qualifying for the second stage of the Champions League. They will be massively disappointed. I expect Rangers not to take this lying down.\" Hard cash is not, however, the stuff of legends. Of all the attractions of being at Celtic, the possibility of becoming a legend must figure highly in O'Neill's mind. In which case, he may be inclined to build steadily rather than risk failing wildly with someone else's money. That is why the celebrations at Celtic Park were so uninhibited on Saturday. This was not a chequebook victory. Integrity remained intact. Understandably, O'Neill's name is being linked to the manager's job at Manchester United, which falls vacant when Sir Alex Ferguson's contract expires next year. He is, after all, just a Tennent's Scottish Cup win away from a domestic treble. Imagine, though, if O'Neill were to take over from Ferguson. Even if he were to win another Champions Cup - a tall order in a hard act to follow - he could end up no more than a keeper of the flame. It is a happy coincidence that the championship should be won during the same weekend as the US Masters. Celtic should aspire to that level of detail which has the green keepers at Augusta tending their lawns with nail scissors. Celtic are a long way from that - on and off the field - which places O'Neill in an enviable position. Sir Alex is Sir Alex because of how far he developed Manchester United. O'Neill is obviously attuned to Celtic and he has quickly delivered silverware. This season he has created a team that is the antithesis of the swashbuckling Celtics of old without a murmur of protest. It is because there is a sense of one being perfect for the other. Two seasons ago, Celtic were not a world power and the fans knew it. This time, the fans sung with such gusto because of the wonderfully endless possibilities that now await.",

      "body": "<p>An hour and a half before the kick-off, the players of Wycombe Wanderers walked out on to the Villa Park pitch in their new warm-up kit. Each had just been handed his copy of the match programme, and most of them were busy ensuring that their names were there, next to the legends of Liverpool in a real-life FA Cup semi-final. </p> <p>In all honesty, that was the closest they were to come to taking the next step. Despite the display of copious amounts of courage and endeavour, there was never any real doubt that the side currently 18th in the Nationwide Second Division would be forced to yield to the team standing fourth in the Premier League. </p> <p>Not that they made it easy for their opponents. As the match went into injury-time, with Liverpool desperately clearing their lines, it was impossible not to admire the way Wycombe had conducted themselves. Their limitations were plain to see, but they had strained every sinew to give an account of themselves that would at least do justice to their feat in reaching the last four and reward the 20,000 fans who made the journey up the M40. </p> <p>Even when goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler, in the 78th and 83rd minutes, had appeared to put the issue beyond doubt, Wycombe came back to keep the match alive with a classic underdog's route one goal, finished off by a looping shot from their captain, Keith Ryan. And then, urged on by the blue-clad mass in the Holte End, they produced a feverish final assault which Liverpool repelled only at some cost to their manager's nerves. </p> <p>So Lawrie Sanchez could lead his team back home with a real sense of pride. After all, with 45 minutes gone the score had been nil-nil -just as it had been at the Nou Camp on Thursday - except that then Liverpool's opponents had been Rivaldo, Kluivert and the rest of Barcelona's all-star team, rather than Andy Rammell, Paul McCarthy, and Wycombe's collection of Conference veterans and honest journeymen. And the other difference was that this time Liverpool were trying to score goals rather than prevent them. </p> <p>Liverpool had appeared in 21 previous semi-finals in the competition, and Wycombe in none. Now Liverpool will attempt to win it for the sixth time, which would give them their second trophy of the season, with a third - the Uefa Cup - still a possibility. No wonder G\u00e9rard Houllier received an ovation as he left the pitch. </p> <p>Once again Houllier shuffled the starting line-up to meet the particular requirements of this tie, selecting Gary McAllister to provide the service for the two strikers, Fowler and Michael Owen, but the plan was foiled by a glistening surface which made accurate through-balls difficult to achieve and McAllister a peripheral figure. The first half passed with few chances for either side, although Martin Taylor in the Wycombe goal distinguished himself by twice dashing out to smother the ball at Owen's feet. </p> <p>Wycombe's goal attempts before half-time were limited to a speculative 30-yard chip from Ryan which floated over Sander Westerveld's bar and a glancing header with which the same player met Michael Simpson's free-kick, caught with some difficulty by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Both sides had penalty claims denied, first when Chris Vinnicombe appeared to clip Owen's ankles and then when Markus Babbel seemed to push Steve Brown as they tussled under a cross. </p> <p>The first of Liverpool's two crucial substitutions came six minutes into the second half, Steven Gerrard replacing the limping Nick Barmby and immediately injecting extra pace into Liverpool's attacks. Sanchez replied by throwing on Roy Essandoh, scorer of the last-minute winner in the quarter-final against Leicester City, after 55 minutes, but Wycombe were never able to attack the penalty area with the sort of high balls that might have made the most of his ability in the air. </p> <p>When Houllier sent on Heskey for Christian Ziege just after the hour, Liverpool switched to a 4-3-3 formation and immediately raised the pressure. After the Wycombe goalkeeper met Heskey's powerful 75th-minute header with a tremendous diving catch, the cries of \"Taylor for England\" were still ringing around the Holte End when the 34-year-old former coalminer raced out yet again to dive at Owen's feet as the England striker tore in to meet Gerrard's incisive pass. The ball went out for a corner but, after Taylor had punched McAllister's kick away, it was knocked back in by Gerrard with such speed and accuracy that all Heskey had to do was incline his head to send the ball into the net and give Liverpool the lead. </p> <p>The immediate arrival of Danny Murphy in place of Owen saw Liverpool revert to their original formation, but they were soon able to extend their advantage. After Jamie Bates was adjudged, perhaps harshly, to have brought down Heskey while they tussled for the ball just outside the area, Fowler carefully curled his free-kick inside Taylor's left-hand post. </p> <p>Ryan's reponse raised the vision of a last-minute miracle, adding statistical respectability to a proud day in the history of a club which played its first match in 1887 but which entered the Football League only eight years ago. The refusal of the dignified Sanchez to employ the tactics of cynicism against more gifted opponents did enormous credit to him and his players, among whom the resolute Brown and his midfield partner Dannie Bulman were outstanding.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An hour and a half before the kick-off, the players of Wycombe Wanderers walked out on to the Villa Park pitch in their new warm-up kit. Each had just been handed his copy of the match programme, and most of them were busy ensuring that their names were there, next to the legends of Liverpool in a real-life FA Cup semi-final. In all honesty, that was the closest they were to come to taking the next step. Despite the display of copious amounts of courage and endeavour, there was never any real doubt that the side currently 18th in the Nationwide Second Division would be forced to yield to the team standing fourth in the Premier League. Not that they made it easy for their opponents. As the match went into injury-time, with Liverpool desperately clearing their lines, it was impossible not to admire the way Wycombe had conducted themselves. Their limitations were plain to see, but they had strained every sinew to give an account of themselves that would at least do justice to their feat in reaching the last four and reward the 20,000 fans who made the journey up the M40. Even when goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler, in the 78th and 83rd minutes, had appeared to put the issue beyond doubt, Wycombe came back to keep the match alive with a classic underdog's route one goal, finished off by a looping shot from their captain, Keith Ryan. And then, urged on by the blue-clad mass in the Holte End, they produced a feverish final assault which Liverpool repelled only at some cost to their manager's nerves. So Lawrie Sanchez could lead his team back home with a real sense of pride. After all, with 45 minutes gone the score had been nil-nil -just as it had been at the Nou Camp on Thursday - except that then Liverpool's opponents had been Rivaldo, Kluivert and the rest of Barcelona's all-star team, rather than Andy Rammell, Paul McCarthy, and Wycombe's collection of Conference veterans and honest journeymen. And the other difference was that this time Liverpool were trying to score goals rather than prevent them. Liverpool had appeared in 21 previous semi-finals in the competition, and Wycombe in none. Now Liverpool will attempt to win it for the sixth time, which would give them their second trophy of the season, with a third - the Uefa Cup - still a possibility. No wonder G\u00e9rard Houllier received an ovation as he left the pitch. Once again Houllier shuffled the starting line-up to meet the particular requirements of this tie, selecting Gary McAllister to provide the service for the two strikers, Fowler and Michael Owen, but the plan was foiled by a glistening surface which made accurate through-balls difficult to achieve and McAllister a peripheral figure. The first half passed with few chances for either side, although Martin Taylor in the Wycombe goal distinguished himself by twice dashing out to smother the ball at Owen's feet. Wycombe's goal attempts before half-time were limited to a speculative 30-yard chip from Ryan which floated over Sander Westerveld's bar and a glancing header with which the same player met Michael Simpson's free-kick, caught with some difficulty by the Liverpool goalkeeper. Both sides had penalty claims denied, first when Chris Vinnicombe appeared to clip Owen's ankles and then when Markus Babbel seemed to push Steve Brown as they tussled under a cross. The first of Liverpool's two crucial substitutions came six minutes into the second half, Steven Gerrard replacing the limping Nick Barmby and immediately injecting extra pace into Liverpool's attacks. Sanchez replied by throwing on Roy Essandoh, scorer of the last-minute winner in the quarter-final against Leicester City, after 55 minutes, but Wycombe were never able to attack the penalty area with the sort of high balls that might have made the most of his ability in the air. When Houllier sent on Heskey for Christian Ziege just after the hour, Liverpool switched to a 4-3-3 formation and immediately raised the pressure. After the Wycombe goalkeeper met Heskey's powerful 75th-minute header with a tremendous diving catch, the cries of \"Taylor for England\" were still ringing around the Holte End when the 34-year-old former coalminer raced out yet again to dive at Owen's feet as the England striker tore in to meet Gerrard's incisive pass. The ball went out for a corner but, after Taylor had punched McAllister's kick away, it was knocked back in by Gerrard with such speed and accuracy that all Heskey had to do was incline his head to send the ball into the net and give Liverpool the lead. The immediate arrival of Danny Murphy in place of Owen saw Liverpool revert to their original formation, but they were soon able to extend their advantage. After Jamie Bates was adjudged, perhaps harshly, to have brought down Heskey while they tussled for the ball just outside the area, Fowler carefully curled his free-kick inside Taylor's left-hand post. Ryan's reponse raised the vision of a last-minute miracle, adding statistical respectability to a proud day in the history of a club which played its first match in 1887 but which entered the Football League only eight years ago. The refusal of the dignified Sanchez to employ the tactics of cynicism against more gifted opponents did enormous credit to him and his players, among whom the resolute Brown and his midfield partner Dannie Bulman were outstanding.",

The prime minister's address this week to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference in Torquay signals the importance of education as an election issue. Two years ago Mr Blair addressed the National Association of Head Teachers' conference, but this would be the first time a prime minister has attended a classroom teacher union conference. Mr Blair is expected to highlight the government's commitment to education, which it insists will still be its top priority in a second term. David Blunkett, the education secretary, will attend the National Union of Teachers' conference in Cardiff where, before coming into government, he was once forced into a cupboard by angry activists. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, who was heckled last year by NUT members over performance-related pay, will address the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers in Jersey. Mr Blair's education team are likely to face accusations that they are implementing a two-tier state education system and failing to give teachers powers to deal with unruly children. Today the Association of Teachers and Lecturers is expected to endorse a motion, supported by the executives of NUT, the NASUWT, and the Welsh teaching body UCAC, calling for an agreement on conditions similar to those agreed for Scotland, including a wide-ranging independent inquiry, a limited working week and a maximum 22.5 hours contact time in the classroom. The motion calls for \"effective action, short of strike action\" if the government does not agree to their demands. Mr Blunkett has rejected the call. Doug McAvoy, the general secretary of the NUT, believes teachers could be ready to take action - effectively by bringing in a work to rule - in October, following union ballots. But the NUT executive fears its activists may want to amend the motion to call for strike action if its demands are not met. Campaigners for professional unity - a single union representing rank and file teachers - are encouraged by recent developments. The NUT and NASUWT have held joint industrial action over teacher shortages in many areas of the country, which has led to hundreds of pupils being sent home. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which has signed an alliance with the Association of University Teachers, would like to have taken part and protested to the TUC general secretary, John Monks, an advocate of unity, that it had been excluded. The other two unions apologised. The unions feel threatened by the new General Teaching Council for England, set up to promote and regulate the profession, which they feel is trying to usurp their role as the \"voice of the profession\".

      "body": "<p> Nowadays, April is the busiest month for the Advisory Centre for Education. \"At this time of year, it's mammoth,\" says Susan Rees, a barrister and co-ordinator at the charity, which was founded in 1960 to advise parents on educational matters. Currently, about a fifth of the calls to the ACE helpline are from parents who want to appeal against their local authority's decision on a school for their child. </p> <p> The two lines are so busy that she advises parents to send off for the ACE booklet on school appeals (free on request - send an A5 stamped addressed envelope to the address at the end of this article) before trying to call. </p> <p>Susan, who began to work for ACE after becoming a school governor, estimates that about a third of appeals are successful, although that figure varies widely from school to school. \" A lot of parents want to leave no stone unturned,\" she says, \"and it's a very stressful time. But you've got to remember that there are a lot of other people appealing, and you've got to back up everything you say. </p> <p>\"Try to think of the needs your child has and link them to the school you want. I would look at the school's prospectus and its Ofsted reports.

      "bodyText": "Nowadays, April is the busiest month for the Advisory Centre for Education. \"At this time of year, it's mammoth,\" says Susan Rees, a barrister and co-ordinator at the charity, which was founded in 1960 to advise parents on educational matters. Currently, about a fifth of the calls to the ACE helpline are from parents who want to appeal against their local authority's decision on a school for their child. The two lines are so busy that she advises parents to send off for the ACE booklet on school appeals (free on request - send an A5 stamped addressed envelope to the address at the end of this article) before trying to call. Susan, who began to work for ACE after becoming a school governor, estimates that about a third of appeals are successful, although that figure varies widely from school to school. \" A lot of parents want to leave no stone unturned,\" she says, \"and it's a very stressful time. But you've got to remember that there are a lot of other people appealing, and you've got to back up everything you say. \"Try to think of the needs your child has and link them to the school you want. I would look at the school's prospectus and its Ofsted reports. For example, if your child has been bullied in the past, you could point out in your appeal that the school you want has a strong anti-bullying policy.\" The number of appeals has increased due to parental choice, the effect of league tables and as schools have diversified, she says, and the growth in foundation, religious and specialist schools has made it easier for parents to find schools they badly want their child to attend. The tendency of church schools to hold interviews has further complicated the admissions process. \u0095 You can obtain a free copy of ACE's booklet on school appeals by sending an A5 stamped addressed envelope to the following address: Advisory Centre For Education Department A Unit 1C Aberdeen Studios 22 Highbury Grove London N5 2DQ Parents can also call the free helpline on 0808 800 5793, which is open between 2pm and 5pm on weekdays.

      "bodyText": "Senior Newsnight staff have slammed the BBC for deciding to run Jeremy Paxman's interviews with Tony Blair and William Hague as Newsnight specials on BBC2, rather than on BBC1. They say Paxman's interview with Blair will be such \"box office\" it should be given as wide an audience as possible. \"What they've effectively done is killed off the exposure an interview with a party leader should have on the BBC's flagship channel,\" said one source. The source pointed out that during the 1997 general election interviews with the party leaders had gone out on BBC1 and BBC2 and, crucially, the BBC1 interviews had been conducted by David Dimbleby on Panorama. The insiders believe the decision to run the interviews on Newsnight means they have been sidelined. \"We're quite happy to be on BBC2,\" said the source, \"but the interviews should be on a mass-audience channel.\" But BBC news and current affairs bosses have said they believe the three election editions of Question Time, which will be scheduled at 9pm on BBC1, will be the centrepiece of the corporation's election coverage. Mark Damazer, the BBC's assistant director for news, defended the decision, saying the interviews were being more \"aggressively scheduled\" this time around. \"We did Panorama specials for the last election, which aren't happening this year,\" he said, \"but last time neither were scheduled aggressively.\" Mr Damazer said the \"Big Dimbleby experience\" - the Question Time editions where party leaders will be questioned individually by members of the audience - would be shown at 9pm on BBC1. He said it would not be appropriate for the Newsnight interviews to \"come into BBC1's universe\". Meanwhile, contrary to reports, Mr Damazer said the BBC's Ten O'Clock News would be extended at election time by approximately seven minutes each weekday evening. He said the Nine O'Clock News's extended coverage at the last general election had been \"too long\". It emerged today that Mr Blair and Mr Hague had agreed to the Paxman interviews. Mr Hague last appeared on Newsnight two years ago, when Mr Paxman grilled him about the sacking of Lord Cranborne, leader of the Conservative peers. Mr Paxman, who is famed for his aggressive interviewing style, told the Tory leader: \"You can't even control a toff in the House of Lords\", and asked him: \"Do you ever wonder if you're up to the job?\". The Conservative leader has refused to appear on the programme ever since. However, it is believed he has agreed to go head to head with Mr Paxman on the advice of his press secretary Amanda Platell and friend Sebastian Coe, who claim he would appear frightened if he backed out.

RBS claims that Sir George was entitled to the options because during the battle for NatWest he was appointed executive deputy chairman and nominated to succeed Viscount Younger as chairman on his retirement on Wednesday.

The Association of British Insurers has already voiced disquiet about the make-up of the committee, while the NAPF is trying to remove non-executive directors Sir Iain Vallance and Sir Angus Grossart from the board on Wednesday. The NAPF dislikes the takeover bonuses because they reward making deals rather than the creation of shareholder value.",

      "body": "<p>A familiar tale from the Middle East: \"Palestinians launched three bombs overnight against the Eile Sinai settlement in the far north of the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops responded with tank shells, destroying a Palestinian border post and hitting two houses.\"</p> <p>This report, which happens to have come from the BBC, is familiar not only for the events it describes but also for the way it describes them: the Palestinians attack and the Israelis \"respond\".</p> <p>Military actions by the Israelis are always a \"response\" to something, even when they strike first. If they haven't actually been attacked, it's a \"response\" to a security threat.</p> <p>\"Response\" is a very useful word. It provides a ready-made reason for the Israelis' actions and neatly brushes off demands for further explanation. It says: \"Don't ask us why we did it, ask the other side.\"</p> <p>There's no point in blaming the Israelis for using this device; the question is whether journalists should let it shape their reporting of the conflict.</p> <p>Portraying the conflict as a series of Palestinian actions and Israeli responses is dangerous, for several reasons.</p> <p>Firstly, it lends support to the Israeli argument that if only the Palestinians would stop their violence everything would be fine. That might be true for many Israelis, but not for the Palestinians.</p> <p>Secondly, it builds up - through constant repetition - into a misleading picture of the overall conflict. The violence is not a series of discrete actions and reactions but a cycle (or spiral) in which actions on both sides feed off those on the other.</p> <p>Thirdly, while Israeli actions are reported as a self-justifying \"response\", actions by the Palestinians are rarely allowed either a proper context or an understandable motive.</p> <p>Obviously there is a limit to what can be said in a news story of 300-400 words, and some journalists will argue that their main job is to report the day's events, not to explain the background.</p> <p>But I am not suggesting they should turn it into a history lecture; merely that they should at least hint at a broader picture and acknowledge that the Palestinians might have some genuine grievances.</p> <p>To do this is neither difficult nor unduly word-consuming. Some news agency reports, for instance, routinely work into their stories a five-word reference to the \"Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation\".</p> <p>The Israeli occupation lies at the root of the conflict - and yet, more often than not, journalists fail to remind their readers of it.</p> <p>The Guardian's electronic newspaper archive contains all the British national dailies, plus the London Evening Standard. A search of this reveals 1,669 stories published during the last 12 months that mentioned the West Bank.</p> <p>Of these, 49 contained the phrase \"occupied West Bank\". A further 513 included the word \"occupied\" or \"occupation\" elsewhere in the text. That leaves 1,107 stories - 66% of the total - which managed to talk about the West Bank without mentioning one of the key facts.</p> <p>Some journalists - particularly Americans - seem reluctant to treat occupation as an established fact and instead treat it as an opinion which should be attributed to someone. Last October, for example, CCN's Jerusalem bureau chief told viewers that Palestinians were angry at \"what they regard as the Israeli occupation\".</p> <p>Others resort to euphemisms: the West Bank is \"disputed\" or \"administrated by Israel\". Some adopt the practice of Israeli officials by shortening \"the Occupied Territories\" to \"the Territories\".</p> <p>Journalists are also rather timid on the question of Jewish settlers, usually portraying them as a target of violence but more rarely as one of the major causes (which they plainly are). Some of the recent stories about the killing of a 10-month-old Jewish baby, Shalhevet Pass, in Hebron made clear that the settlers there are a tiny and particularly fanatical bunch - though many did not.</p> <p>One report described Hebron as a \"divided city\", when in fact 99.8% of the inhabitants are Arabs. (Jerusalem, on the other hand - with two-thirds of the population Jewish and one-third Arab - is constantly described by Israelis as \"undivided\".)</p> <p>Over the last 12 months, 394 stories in the archive mentioned Jewish settlers. Of these, seven included the phrase \"extremist settler\" and eight \"extremist Jewish settler\". The word \"extremist\" did occur in 44 of the stories, though not necessarily applied to settlers. Some stories juxtaposed settlers characterised simply as \"Jewish\" with Palestinians characterised as \"extremist\".</p> <p>The illegality of the settlements under international law also often escapes mention. The phrase \"illegal settlement\", used in an Israeli-Palestinian context, appeared only eight times during the last 12 months - and three of those were in readers' letters to the editor.</p> <p>During the early stages of the intifada newspapers were accused of \"dehumanising\" Palestinians by publishing numbers but not names of those killed. This was contrasted with the wealth of personal information, helpfully provided by the Israeli authorities, about Jewish casualties.</p> <p>The lack of Palestinian names was certainly not due to a conscious policy on the part of journalists and, although there are sometimes difficulties in getting the names, efforts have been made to remedy it.</p> <p>However, last week's search of the archive highlighted another practice which has a similar effect: Jews mainly live in \"communities\" but Palestinians live in \"areas\".</p> <p>Palestinian \"areas\" scored 109 mentions over the last 12 months; \"neighbourhoods\" scored 15 and \"communities\" only three (one each in the Guardian, Observer and Independent).</p> <p>In the case of Jews, the positions were reversed: \"communities\" scored 87, \"neighbourhoods\" 30 and \"areas\" 21.</p> <p>This is clearly not intentional and it may be partly due to the way we speak of Jewish communities in the diaspora. But the overall pattern does suggest a perception - perhaps an unconscious one - that Palestinians are less civilised.

      "bodyText": "A familiar tale from the Middle East: \"Palestinians launched three bombs overnight against the Eile Sinai settlement in the far north of the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops responded with tank shells, destroying a Palestinian border post and hitting two houses.\" This report, which happens to have come from the BBC, is familiar not only for the events it describes but also for the way it describes them: the Palestinians attack and the Israelis \"respond\". Military actions by the Israelis are always a \"response\" to something, even when they strike first. If they haven't actually been attacked, it's a \"response\" to a security threat. \"Response\" is a very useful word. It provides a ready-made reason for the Israelis' actions and neatly brushes off demands for further explanation. It says: \"Don't ask us why we did it, ask the other side.\" There's no point in blaming the Israelis for using this device; the question is whether journalists should let it shape their reporting of the conflict. Portraying the conflict as a series of Palestinian actions and Israeli responses is dangerous, for several reasons. Firstly, it lends support to the Israeli argument that if only the Palestinians would stop their violence everything would be fine. That might be true for many Israelis, but not for the Palestinians. Secondly, it builds up - through constant repetition - into a misleading picture of the overall conflict. The violence is not a series of discrete actions and reactions but a cycle (or spiral) in which actions on both sides feed off those on the other. Thirdly, while Israeli actions are reported as a self-justifying \"response\", actions by the Palestinians are rarely allowed either a proper context or an understandable motive. Obviously there is a limit to what can be said in a news story of 300-400 words, and some journalists will argue that their main job is to report the day's events, not to explain the background. But I am not suggesting they should turn it into a history lecture; merely that they should at least hint at a broader picture and acknowledge that the Palestinians might have some genuine grievances. To do this is neither difficult nor unduly word-consuming. Some news agency reports, for instance, routinely work into their stories a five-word reference to the \"Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation\". The Israeli occupation lies at the root of the conflict - and yet, more often than not, journalists fail to remind their readers of it. The Guardian's electronic newspaper archive contains all the British national dailies, plus the London Evening Standard. A search of this reveals 1,669 stories published during the last 12 months that mentioned the West Bank. Of these, 49 contained the phrase \"occupied West Bank\". A further 513 included the word \"occupied\" or \"occupation\" elsewhere in the text. That leaves 1,107 stories - 66% of the total - which managed to talk about the West Bank without mentioning one of the key facts. Some journalists - particularly Americans - seem reluctant to treat occupation as an established fact and instead treat it as an opinion which should be attributed to someone. Last October, for example, CCN's Jerusalem bureau chief told viewers that Palestinians were angry at \"what they regard as the Israeli occupation\". Others resort to euphemisms: the West Bank is \"disputed\" or \"administrated by Israel\". Some adopt the practice of Israeli officials by shortening \"the Occupied Territories\" to \"the Territories\". Journalists are also rather timid on the question of Jewish settlers, usually portraying them as a target of violence but more rarely as one of the major causes (which they plainly are). Some of the recent stories about the killing of a 10-month-old Jewish baby, Shalhevet Pass, in Hebron made clear that the settlers there are a tiny and particularly fanatical bunch - though many did not. One report described Hebron as a \"divided city\", when in fact 99.8% of the inhabitants are Arabs. (Jerusalem, on the other hand - with two-thirds of the population Jewish and one-third Arab - is constantly described by Israelis as \"undivided\".) Over the last 12 months, 394 stories in the archive mentioned Jewish settlers. Of these, seven included the phrase \"extremist settler\" and eight \"extremist Jewish settler\". The word \"extremist\" did occur in 44 of the stories, though not necessarily applied to settlers. Some stories juxtaposed settlers characterised simply as \"Jewish\" with Palestinians characterised as \"extremist\". The illegality of the settlements under international law also often escapes mention. The phrase \"illegal settlement\", used in an Israeli-Palestinian context, appeared only eight times during the last 12 months - and three of those were in readers' letters to the editor. During the early stages of the intifada newspapers were accused of \"dehumanising\" Palestinians by publishing numbers but not names of those killed. This was contrasted with the wealth of personal information, helpfully provided by the Israeli authorities, about Jewish casualties. The lack of Palestinian names was certainly not due to a conscious policy on the part of journalists and, although there are sometimes difficulties in getting the names, efforts have been made to remedy it. However, last week's search of the archive highlighted another practice which has a similar effect: Jews mainly live in \"communities\" but Palestinians live in \"areas\". Palestinian \"areas\" scored 109 mentions over the last 12 months; \"neighbourhoods\" scored 15 and \"communities\" only three (one each in the Guardian, Observer and Independent). In the case of Jews, the positions were reversed: \"communities\" scored 87, \"neighbourhoods\" 30 and \"areas\" 21. This is clearly not intentional and it may be partly due to the way we speak of Jewish communities in the diaspora. But the overall pattern does suggest a perception - perhaps an unconscious one - that Palestinians are less civilised. Another factor is that \"neighbourhood\" and, to a lesser extent, \"community\" are used as euphemisms for settlements. Israeli spokesmen regularly describe the settlement at Gilo as a \"neighbourhood\" of Jerusalem because it has been unilaterally annexed. A recent report in the Times, following in the tradition of CNN, said that \"Palestinians regard\" Gilo as an illegal settlement. Indeed they do, but then so does international law.

It's a view that is extraordinarily persistent, despite the fact that the Asian population in Britain is twice or more the size of the black one. There can only be one culprit. Our window on the world around us gives us that message day after day. Even black and Asian members of the public see the myth rather than the reality.</p> <p>The latest television research conducted for the Commission for Racial Equality makes the point once again: the balance of people that we see on our screens does not reflect that in the community, and most under-represented are Asians.</p> <p>The survey looked at a total of 204 programmes, the top 10 programmes each week on the five terrestrial channels, over a period of four weeks late last year. (It came to 204, incidentally, because The Simpsons and Friends had double-bill episodes, which we counted twice.) Amazingly, for one week's worth of top 10 programmes on BBC2, The Simpsons was the only show with a non-white presence. Britain's supposed highbrow channel was only saved from presenting an all-white world by a satirical American cartoon. </p> <p>The record is just as dismal elsewhere: in the total sample of 204 programmes, 100 had black or Asian people with speaking parts. And the survey was generous in the way it tallied the score: if the people spoke, even only a couple of words, they were counted. For most people's money, The Full Monty is very much a white film \u0096 even though the original idea was in fact to have a black lead and other key black characters. Yet our method of analysis gives the black and Asian percentage in The Full Monty as 15.4, the figure being boosted by a few minutes in the film when a group of black women get to make a few comments.</p> <p>What really worries me is that the annual monitoring by the Broadcasting Standards Commission does not reveal any progress since the surveys began in 1993. We can all see some very positive changes \u0096 the presence of the younger Asian and black reporters in the news programmes, the development of multicultural programmes but, for the blockbuster shows, the mainstream programmes that present the broadest picture of Britain, there is still a real hesitation when it comes to taking the material steps that will ensure change.</p> <p>A year ago, the director general of the BBC, Greg Dyke, came to the CRE's annual Race In The Media Awards and committed the corporation to new targets for ethnic minority employment levels across its work force. Even better, he set those targets for a date when he would still be in office, so he was taking personal responsibility for their fulfilment. Within the overall targets, he set even tougher ones for boosting the black and Asian presence in the higher grades, the ones where decisions can be influenced rather than just carried out.</p> <p>Some people may have balked at his talk of the BBC being \u0093hideously white\", but Dyke was delivering accountable managerial programmes for practical change as well as trenchantly worded criticisms of the present state of affairs.</p> <p>And it is there that we need to be looking. In reality, we do not need another research report to tell us that British television still does not reflect British society. What we need are sensible measures that will move television on from a situation in which race equality is talked about more than practised. </p> <p>Making sure that the decision-takers in our television corporations reflect the population at large is one crucial step. At this year's awards we heard about another important new approach when it comes to programming policy.</p> <p>Clive Jones, the chief executive of Carlton Television, suggested the idea of a commissioning clause that would require anyone judging a programme proposal to make diversity a key commissioning criterion. Channel 4 has already been piloting the idea, and the television industry alliance on diversity, the Cultural Diversity Network, which Clive chairs, is pushing the proposal, expecting all major broadcasters in Britain to adopt the idea over the coming months. The network is quite blunt about why it is doing so. If British television does not recognise the importance of diversity, it will neither liberate the full range of the talent it needs, nor will it appeal to the growing new audiences that make up modern Britain. If British television continues to marginalise these audiences, they will marginalise British television in their lives.</p> <p>This is a difficult challenge. The problem has to be tackled across the board. No one measure will give the change that the leaders in the industry say they want, and that all viewers have a right to expect. Employment targets as set by Greg Dyke and a commissioning clause as outlined by Clive Jones are positive steps. Without them the changes will not come, but they have to be part of a comprehensive process that brings out into the open exactly what British television is doing at the moment (such as who it is employing and where, and what it is showing on screen) and then pinpoints the problems and lays out programmed action to put them right.</p> <p>It helps no one that young people still grow up looking at the world and themselves through a television screen that hides much of the reality that it does not distort. It is not television's fault that the world out there is infested by racism and discrimination, but television needs to play its part in helping to deal with the problem instead of compromising with it.</p> <p>Television executives need to stop repeating the old mantras that have been the excuses for doing nothing for so long, the claim, for instance, that the talent is not there when it so obviously is. They need to face the fact that much of the responsibility for the failure of television on the diversity fronts lies in the details of the decisions they take.</p> <p>How is it that for four weeks in a row, BBC1's Antiques Roadshow fails to have a single black or Asian talking presence? One can perhaps understand how Channel 4's Neanderthal had no black or Asian presence given that everyone has made the assumption that we \u0093know\u0094 they were white, but Heartbeat, four episodes in a row?</p> <p>\u0095 Gurbux Singh is chair of the CRE.</p>",

We can all see some very positive changes \u0096 the presence of the younger Asian and black reporters in the news programmes, the development of multicultural programmes but, for the blockbuster shows, the mainstream programmes that present the broadest picture of Britain, there is still a real hesitation when it comes to taking the material steps that will ensure change. A year ago, the director general of the BBC, Greg Dyke, came to the CRE's annual Race In The Media Awards and committed the corporation to new targets for ethnic minority employment levels across its work force. Even better, he set those targets for a date when he would still be in office, so he was taking personal responsibility for their fulfilment. Within the overall targets, he set even tougher ones for boosting the black and Asian presence in the higher grades, the ones where decisions can be influenced rather than just carried out. Some people may have balked at his talk of the BBC being \u0093hideously white\", but Dyke was delivering accountable managerial programmes for practical change as well as trenchantly worded criticisms of the present state of affairs. And it is there that we need to be looking. In reality, we do not need another research report to tell us that British television still does not reflect British society. What we need are sensible measures that will move television on from a situation in which race equality is talked about more than practised. Making sure that the decision-takers in our television corporations reflect the population at large is one crucial step. At this year's awards we heard about another important new approach when it comes to programming policy. Clive Jones, the chief executive of Carlton Television, suggested the idea of a commissioning clause that would require anyone judging a programme proposal to make diversity a key commissioning criterion. Channel 4 has already been piloting the idea, and the television industry alliance on diversity, the Cultural Diversity Network, which Clive chairs, is pushing the proposal, expecting all major broadcasters in Britain to adopt the idea over the coming months. The network is quite blunt about why it is doing so. If British television does not recognise the importance of diversity, it will neither liberate the full range of the talent it needs, nor will it appeal to the growing new audiences that make up modern Britain. If British television continues to marginalise these audiences, they will marginalise British television in their lives. This is a difficult challenge. The problem has to be tackled across the board. No one measure will give the change that the leaders in the industry say they want, and that all viewers have a right to expect. Employment targets as set by Greg Dyke and a commissioning clause as outlined by Clive Jones are positive steps. Without them the changes will not come, but they have to be part of a comprehensive process that brings out into the open exactly what British television is doing at the moment (such as who it is employing and where, and what it is showing on screen) and then pinpoints the problems and lays out programmed action to put them right. It helps no one that young people still grow up looking at the world and themselves through a television screen that hides much of the reality that it does not distort. It is not television's fault that the world out there is infested by racism and discrimination, but television needs to play its part in helping to deal with the problem instead of compromising with it. Television executives need to stop repeating the old mantras that have been the excuses for doing nothing for so long, the claim, for instance, that the talent is not there when it so obviously is. They need to face the fact that much of the responsibility for the failure of television on the diversity fronts lies in the details of the decisions they take. How is it that for four weeks in a row, BBC1's Antiques Roadshow fails to have a single black or Asian talking presence? One can perhaps understand how Channel 4's Neanderthal had no black or Asian presence given that everyone has made the assumption that we \u0093know\u0094 they were white, but Heartbeat, four episodes in a row? \u0095 Gurbux Singh is chair of the CRE.",

      "body": "<p>A letter received by the Guardian on Friday morning contained a simple plea: \"Please publish and help restore M&amp;S.\"</p> <p>The writer was referring to an accompanying document that detailed the trading performance of Marks &amp; Spencer across each and every division - from food to knickers. </p> <p>Produced in January, this highly confidential set of management accounts, which would have been circulated amongst just a handful of the retailer's most senior executives, tracked back through the preceding 10 tough months and then set out forecasts through to the end-March close of Marks's financial year.</p> <p>The numbers, needless to say, are grisly. At best, the company only expects to meet the very worst City expectations on profitability. The only part of the business where things are improving is in its food halls, and even here the advance is marginal. Everywhere else, from lingerie to soft furnishings and menswear, sales are in precipitous decline.</p> <p>And, predictably enough, publishing these figures at the weekend has not had the effect of \"restoring M&amp;S\" in the short term. This morning, shares in the retailer dropped another 4% to 250p against an all-time high of 664p. The value of a business which was once a British icon has slumped from over \u00a318bn to close to \u00a37bn.</p> <p>Whether a truer and more public understanding of the depth of crisis at M&amp;S helps secure the company's future longer-term - gilding management (existing or new) into action - is difficult to say. Many retailing experts believe the company is in irreversible, secular decline and say the only course of action is to break the business up. Others simply say it needs more retailing nous - the \"Arab trader with a rolled-out carpet mentality\", as one major high street rival puts it - to restore key areas of Marks's business, principally womenswear and menswear.</p> <p>In the meantime, the existing management, led by Belgian chairman and chief executive Luc Vandevelde, seems to be tearing itself to shreds. Tempers appear to have been inflamed by last week's revelation in the Guardian that Mr Vandevelde is still in line to collect a \u00a3650,000 bonus agreed at the time of his appointment, even though the new man has singularly failed to fashion a revival in Marks's fortunes. </p> <p>Other senior management are not so lucky. The document which landed at the Guardian on Friday details how a \u00a310m provision for executive bonuses has been routed back into profits, since second and third tier management have failed to meet any of their sales or profitability targets for individual parts of the business. They feel deeply aggrieved, having to pay the price for what they perceive to be failure at the top, and the result has been a relentless round of internal bickering about where the problems really lie and who is best placed to fix them.</p> <p>To make matters worse, there are fresh noises from those outside who have threatened in the past to try and take Marks over. Best known of these is Phillip Green, the Monaco-based entrepreneur who currently runs Bhs and who was close to raising the finance for a bid last year. Expect fresh aggressive rumblings from this man.</p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4167208,00.html\">08.04.2001: M&amp;S hit by lawsuits, leaks and buyout fear</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4167192,00.html\">08.04.2001: Marks of shame</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4166960,00.html\"> 07.04.2001: Leaked papers reveal the devastating decline of M&amp;S</a><br><a href=\"\">07.04.2001: M&amp;S slips deeper into crisis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4166126,00.html\">06.04.2001: France calls for protests at M&amp;S closures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4166039,00.html\">05.04.2001: Sparks fly over French M&amp;S closures</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4165445,00.html\">05.04.2001: Belgium joins battle over M&amp;S closures</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4164760,00.html\">04.04.2001: M&amp;S faces bonus row</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4163364,00.html\">02.04.2001: French say M&amp;S closure may have been illegal</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4162189,00.html\">30.03.2001: M&amp;S banks on drastic new makeover</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A letter received by the Guardian on Friday morning contained a simple plea: \"Please publish and help restore M&amp;S.\" The writer was referring to an accompanying document that detailed the trading performance of Marks &amp; Spencer across each and every division - from food to knickers. Produced in January, this highly confidential set of management accounts, which would have been circulated amongst just a handful of the retailer's most senior executives, tracked back through the preceding 10 tough months and then set out forecasts through to the end-March close of Marks's financial year. The numbers, needless to say, are grisly. At best, the company only expects to meet the very worst City expectations on profitability. The only part of the business where things are improving is in its food halls, and even here the advance is marginal. Everywhere else, from lingerie to soft furnishings and menswear, sales are in precipitous decline. And, predictably enough, publishing these figures at the weekend has not had the effect of \"restoring M&amp;S\" in the short term. This morning, shares in the retailer dropped another 4% to 250p against an all-time high of 664p. The value of a business which was once a British icon has slumped from over \u00a318bn to close to \u00a37bn. Whether a truer and more public understanding of the depth of crisis at M&amp;S helps secure the company's future longer-term - gilding management (existing or new) into action - is difficult to say. Many retailing experts believe the company is in irreversible, secular decline and say the only course of action is to break the business up. Others simply say it needs more retailing nous - the \"Arab trader with a rolled-out carpet mentality\", as one major high street rival puts it - to restore key areas of Marks's business, principally womenswear and menswear. In the meantime, the existing management, led by Belgian chairman and chief executive Luc Vandevelde, seems to be tearing itself to shreds. Tempers appear to have been inflamed by last week's revelation in the Guardian that Mr Vandevelde is still in line to collect a \u00a3650,000 bonus agreed at the time of his appointment, even though the new man has singularly failed to fashion a revival in Marks's fortunes. Other senior management are not so lucky. The document which landed at the Guardian on Friday details how a \u00a310m provision for executive bonuses has been routed back into profits, since second and third tier management have failed to meet any of their sales or profitability targets for individual parts of the business. They feel deeply aggrieved, having to pay the price for what they perceive to be failure at the top, and the result has been a relentless round of internal bickering about where the problems really lie and who is best placed to fix them. To make matters worse, there are fresh noises from those outside who have threatened in the past to try and take Marks over. Best known of these is Phillip Green, the Monaco-based entrepreneur who currently runs Bhs and who was close to raising the finance for a bid last year. Expect fresh aggressive rumblings from this man.

The Kilshaws appealed that decision. A Californian couple, Richard and Vickie Allen, initially contested the Kilshaws' claim to the twins, claiming they had paid $6,000 to adopt them. The Allens bowed out of the battle after Richard Allen was accused of molesting two baby sitters. Allen has pleaded innocent, but the couple has also lost custody of a two-year-old boy they were seeking to adopt. The twins' adoption by the Kilshaws was declared void on March 6 when an Arkansas court ruled that the UK couple and Ms Wecker had not met the 30-day residency requirement to qualify as state residents at the time of the adoption. The Kilshaws appealed that decision. Last week, lawyers for each of the twins' estranged biological parents, Tranda and Aaron Wecker of St Louis, Missouri, filed papers asking Kirkwood to declare the girls abducted children under the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption.",

Greengrocer Steven Thoburn, 36, of Sunderland, now faces a maximum fine of \u00a31,000 on each of the two offences and court costs estimated at up to \u00a360,000. He was convicted of breaching the Weights and Measures Act 1985 in a hearing which district judge Bruce Morgan said centred on the \"most famous bunch of bananas in legal history\". Mr Thoburn denied the charges, which were brought after trading standards officers from Sunderland city council raided his market stall in the Southwick area of the city in July last year and seized two sets of scales. Mr Thoburn - dubbed \"the metric martyr\" by his supporters - was prosecuted for selling his produce in pounds and ounces. In his ruling, Mr Morgan told Sunderland magistrates court that he was aware that regardless of the verdict the case would be going to appeal. \"It has been made clear to me that despite the decision of this court the matter will be taken elsewhere.\" Earlier, Mr Thoburn said: \"I wake up at night in a panic and try to work out how we got to this state and how my mates and I could find ourselves persecuted for doing nothing more than selling fruit and veg.\" Eleanor Sharpston QC, for Sunderland city council, maintained during the case that if Britain wanted to be part of Europe it had to abide by its laws.

      "bodyText": "The German energy firm Eon today announced it is to take over Powergen, the British electricity company, in a \u00a39.6bn deal hailed as a platform for overseas growth. The long-awaited offer has been recommended by Powergen's board and was described by Eon as a major step that would give it a \"leading position in the UK utilities market\". Powergen's chairman, Ed Wallis, said: \"I am delighted we have been able to reach agreement with Eon. This is a good deal for our shareholders, our employees and our customers as well as for Eon.\" Powergen said that there were no plans for large-scale job cuts as a result of the deal, describing it as \"good news for UK jobs\" and a \"platform for growth rather than for cost cuttings\". The company employs 13,000 staff, 7,000 of whom are based in the UK. Today's deal comes three months after Powergen first disclosed that it had received a takeover approach from Eon. The deal is expected to give Eon a foothold in the American as well as the British market. Eon's chairman, Ulrich Hartmann, said that, following the merger last year that created Eon, the group had positioned itself as one of the \"top players in Europe\". John Rowse, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, which represents Powergen staff, said: \"We welcome the stability for workers and the company's assurances that there would be no negative impact on jobs.\" Shares in Powergen rose by nearly 1% following the announcement - rising 6.5p to 712.5p in early trading. Under Eon's offer, Powergen's shares are valued at 765p each.

However, this is not the first time a photograph of Mazher Mahmood has appeared in the national press. \"We firmly believe that Observer readers have shown almost as great an interest in the provenance of this story and they have done in the detail allegedly revealed in the so-called 'Sophie tapes'.

Despite being an Australian citizen since 1999, there is still no word on whether Mr Kayani's family will be able to join him permanently if he recovers from his critical burns.

      "bodyText": "The government today fired its latest salvo in the war against drugs with a \u00a3220m fund aimed at creating a network of regional partnerships to help fight drug related crime. The scheme - the money for which was first announced in the chancellor's Budget last month - will see 376 local initiatives funded over the next three years as part of the government's \"communities against drugs\" campaign. Manchester United star Andy Cole and manager Sir Alex Ferguson will today pledge their support for the scheme at a meeting with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the cabinet office minister, Ian McCartney, in Manchester. Mr Straw said: \"The funding that we are announcing today will make a real difference to hundreds of communities across the country and the money will allow local solutions to local problems. He expected the cash to be spent on equipment like mobile police stations and schemes to set up more police bases in shopping centres. Security cameras, security lighting and so called \"private policemen\" or neighbourhood wardens could also be recruited. The home secretary pledged the funds would be \"available quickly without a long-winded bidding process\". The package would concentrate on highly addictive class A drugs like heroin and cocaine, added Mr Straw. Mr McCartney made an impassioned speech in support of today's announcement. His son Hugh, 23, died after a heroin overdose in September 1999, and Mr McCartney spoke with emotion about the damage caused to families by drugs. \"No longer can we simply leave it to the police.

Other schemes include mobile police stations in rural areas where there are drug problems and centres of education for former and recovering drugs abusers. Home Office figures show that the cost of crimes committed to feed addicts' habits each year is \u00a32.5bn and 12,250 suspected offenders are arrested every week who have taken heroin cocaine or crack in the previous 48 hours. And an independent study estimated that half of criminals entering prison had a serious drugs problem.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the early days of film, John Russell Taylor and John Kobal wrote in their book Portraits of the British Cinema, \"American stars had faces; British stars had voices.\" In the 1950s, Cornel Lucas was the first to change that, working with Rank, which at its peak had more than 40 \"artistes\" under contract. It was Lucas who created the star image of, among others, the young Joan Collins and Diana Dors, and gave manly glamour to Dirk Bogarde, Peter Finch and Trevor Howard. </p> <p>It was not easy to persuade Rank that Britain should go the American way and employ specialist portraitists, even though Hollywood's photographers had done a better job of immortalising the likes of Greta Garbo, Hedy Lemarr and Marlene Dietrich than their often unreliable films. \"The problem for the British,\" Lucas says, \"was that it was too expensive. It required a special studio, assistants and expensive, heavy plate cameras and accessories.\" </p> <p>It was Lucas and Dietrich who eventually convinced the studios that an in-house portraitist was worth the investment. Dietrich came to England in 1937 to make Knight Without Armour with Robert Donat. Lucas was told to do a portrait. It did not start off well. </p> <p>\"I was very nervous,\" he says.\"While I waited in this big empty studio I put on the radio to keep me company. Suddenly she appeared in the narrow door with a string of assistants - secretary, hair stylist, make-up man, etc - walking in single file behind her. At that moment the radio started playing Colonel Bogey. She marched straight up to the radio and turned it off. 'That won't be necessary, Mr Lucas,' she said frostily. I thought it was a terrible start but she was pleased with the pictures. </p> <p>\"She was adamant that her key light had to be in a certain position. She told me she had discovered the advantages of this '12 o'clock light' one day in Berlin after a show when she slipped out to a photo machine to get a passport photo. She could actually tell from the heat whether the light was right for her. She was a perfect technician.\" </p> <p>Lucas started photography at the age of 13. His brother ran a film library and one day he took Lucas with him in the car to pick up prints. \"At that moment I saw the director Anthony Asquith and Gloria Swanson walk towards me from a dark alley between two stages. That image of one of the world's greatest actresses and a handsome young director made me decide film portraits was the job for me.\" </p> <p>His brother got him a job as a lab technician at Rank. He hated sitting all day in a dark room, supervising the film going into the bins. \"One day,\" he says, \"I was taking care of a Jack Buchanan film, Brewster's Millions, and I fell asleep. I was awakened by someone shaking my shoulder and to my terror found myself wrapped in celluloid. A large section of the film was destroyed. I was fired on the spot. But the shop steward said, 'How old are you, son?' 'Sixteen,' I told him. 'You're too young to be on a negative machine,' he said. And I got my job back.\" </p> <p>In the war Lucas worked on secret night photography with the RAF experimental photographic group at Farnborough. It was not until the war was over that he got his famous \"pool studio\" at Pinewood. \"They covered over the swimming pool,\" he recalls. \"It was very glamorous, with a fountain and dressing rooms.\" Settled at Pinewood, he married one of Rank's most glamorous starlets, Belinda Lee. They divorced and she was killed in a car accident aged 26. (He remarried and now has four children.) </p> <p>When the pool studio was in full swing, every week thousands of prints were sent out around the world. \"We had to be very careful with censorship abroad,\" he said. \"In some middle eastern countries, you could not show a belly button and in Italy you could never show the zip at the back of a lady's skirt.\" </p> <p>One of the future stars he helped to groom was Joan Collins. He remembers this teenager from the Rank Charm School trying desperately to get the lead in Renato Castellani's Romeo and Juliet (1954). Romeo was the handsome, suave newcomer Laurence Harvey. Juliet eventually went to an unknown \"discovery\". The film bombed. \"Joan was a very sweet girl with a great sense of humour,\" Lucas says. But she had to wait another 20 years for real stardom in the role of Dynasty's Alexis Carrington. </p> <p>Did he never think of going to Hollywood? \"I did intend emigrating. I got my papers in 1949 and I went to New York, where Paul Hesse, a great glamour photographer of his day, allowed me to sit in on his work. I went to Hollywood too. But I decided not to emigrate.\" His reason suggests a mentality no longer common in our greedy world. \"Everywhere you went you got these bumper steaks. I had just come from a country still on terribly strict rationing. I couldn't face the enormous meals. I found that very offensive.\" </p> <p>So in a fit of solidarity he came back to share his country's austerity. It has been good for his figure - as he passes 80, he is as trim and active as the most disciplined of Rank's starlets in training. </p> <p>\u0095 Cornel Lucas's exhibition opens at the Photographer's Gallery, London WC2, on Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps the first green shoots of spring are finally pushing through. This week I found myself looking forward to most of the new releases instead of dreading them all, even if they did quickly prove inferior to their trailers. </p> <p>Blow's trailer was a knockout: all fast editing, narcotic excess, Johnny Depp in boss threads, and a soundtrack pulsing with 1960s junkie-rock riffology and 1970s funk grooves. Great, I thought - it'll be like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights. And since Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson won't have new movies out for the rest of the year, this'll have to tide me over. But when I finally saw the movie, the scale of director Ted Demme's debt to these two masters was such that it almost capsized the whole movie. </p> <p>Blow, the rags-to-riches-to-prison-stripes story of George Jung, a pioneering pot and coke dealer in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, seems precisely calculated to appeal to the same largely male demographic that responded to Boogie Nights and Goodfellas. It shares their rainbow-shaped story architecture: bottom to top and right down again. It lets skillfully edited music do its work for it. And it leaves a lot of creative power in the hands of the costume and production design departments. </p> <p>Like a less gifted version of Scorsese or Anderson, Demme gleefully ransacks Hollywood's technical toy closet, digging out the SteadiCam, splitting his screen, working with a number of film stocks and editing the results at a frenzied pace. To depict 20 years of loudly changing fashions Demme even hired Boogie Nights's costume designer, and his breathless editing is heavily indebted to Scorsese's collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker-Powell. </p> <p>All in all, Blow feels like a distinctly third-hand experience. Where Scorsese and Anderson paid meticulous attention to character and moral consequence, Blow is all join-the-dots and colour-by-numbers. Johnny Depp, for all his good taste in projects, has a tendency to languish like a supermodel at the centre of his films, less an actor or a character than an element of the film's design, and here he fails to find the empathy that might earn Jung's story some pathos, or the tragic dimension that Demme is apparently seeking. </p> <p>The fact that one never really gives a stuff about this man who helped swamp America with cocaine is a major problem. You remember the flares, the disco babes, the Tony Montana-levels of nasal ingestion, some nice work from Paul Ruebens of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, and any number of funny, smart sequences, but Demme's movie never hangs together. </p> <p>Lee Tamahori, however, is someone whose movies are worth watching. The Edge, which was Jack London by way of screenwriter David Mamet, was an exhilarating snowbound Deliverance, with a rampaging bear taking the place of redneck rapists.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the first green shoots of spring are finally pushing through. This week I found myself looking forward to most of the new releases instead of dreading them all, even if they did quickly prove inferior to their trailers. Blow's trailer was a knockout: all fast editing, narcotic excess, Johnny Depp in boss threads, and a soundtrack pulsing with 1960s junkie-rock riffology and 1970s funk grooves. Great, I thought - it'll be like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights. And since Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson won't have new movies out for the rest of the year, this'll have to tide me over. But when I finally saw the movie, the scale of director Ted Demme's debt to these two masters was such that it almost capsized the whole movie. Blow, the rags-to-riches-to-prison-stripes story of George Jung, a pioneering pot and coke dealer in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, seems precisely calculated to appeal to the same largely male demographic that responded to Boogie Nights and Goodfellas. It shares their rainbow-shaped story architecture: bottom to top and right down again. It lets skillfully edited music do its work for it. And it leaves a lot of creative power in the hands of the costume and production design departments. Like a less gifted version of Scorsese or Anderson, Demme gleefully ransacks Hollywood's technical toy closet, digging out the SteadiCam, splitting his screen, working with a number of film stocks and editing the results at a frenzied pace. To depict 20 years of loudly changing fashions Demme even hired Boogie Nights's costume designer, and his breathless editing is heavily indebted to Scorsese's collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker-Powell. All in all, Blow feels like a distinctly third-hand experience. Where Scorsese and Anderson paid meticulous attention to character and moral consequence, Blow is all join-the-dots and colour-by-numbers. Johnny Depp, for all his good taste in projects, has a tendency to languish like a supermodel at the centre of his films, less an actor or a character than an element of the film's design, and here he fails to find the empathy that might earn Jung's story some pathos, or the tragic dimension that Demme is apparently seeking. The fact that one never really gives a stuff about this man who helped swamp America with cocaine is a major problem. You remember the flares, the disco babes, the Tony Montana-levels of nasal ingestion, some nice work from Paul Ruebens of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, and any number of funny, smart sequences, but Demme's movie never hangs together. Lee Tamahori, however, is someone whose movies are worth watching. The Edge, which was Jack London by way of screenwriter David Mamet, was an exhilarating snowbound Deliverance, with a rampaging bear taking the place of redneck rapists. It was an odd-sounding experience for everyone involved, but Tamahori made it compelling. The opening sequence of his new movie, Along Came a Spider, has the same sort of headlong energy, as an FBI sting operation goes haywire and ends with an agent hanging over a 500ft dam in an open-topped Mustang. Thereafter, however, the mechanics of the sub-Silence of the Lambs serial-killer genre get the better of Tamahori's sprightly talents. When Jodie Foster pulled that butterfly pupa out of a victim's throat in Lambs, she - or rather Thomas Harris - spawned a subspecies of murderers apparently raised on the mental gymnastics of grandmaster chess and the Times cryptic crossword. But real serial killers don't build elaborate puzzles for their pursuers to unravel; they frenziedly hack at their inert victims like dogs disinterring bones, and then dump the leftovers.

      "body": "<p>After 26 years in the Royal Navy, Captain Paul Bootherstone, who has died of a heart attack aged 62, faced the supreme test of his career in the Falklands war of 1982. He won the Distinguished Service Cross as commander of HMS Arrow, the frigate that rescued the crew of the doomed destroyer Sheffield.</p> <p>Both ships were in the first wave of the 27-warship task force sent to the south Atlantic after the Argentine invasion on April 2. Arrow was one of an eventual total of 10 escorts with the carrier task group formed to seize control - with alarmingly slender resources - of the 200-mile exclusion zone around the islands.</p> <p>The frigate fired the first shot in a bombardment of Port Stanley airfield on May 1. Arrow was also the first British ship to be hit by the daring Argentine pilots who, flying at the very limit of their range, constituted the main threat to the expedition. One sailor was wounded and the ship lightly damaged.</p> <p>The bizarre conflict passed the diplomatic point of no return the next day, when the nuclear attack submarine HMS Conqueror sank the old cruiser General Belgrano outside the zone, with the loss of more than 350 men. On May 4, determined to exact revenge, the Argentine navy sent two Super-Etendard bombers against part of the task force commander Rear-Admiral Sandy Woodward's screen. These were the type 21 frigates, Arrow and Yarmouth, and type 42 destroyer Sheffield, patrolling between 40 and 70 miles south of Stanley and helping to cover the aircraft carriers Hermes and Invincible a further 40 miles out.</p> <p>Each French-built Super-Etendard carried one Exocet missile. Both targeted the anti-aircraft ship Sheffield. One missed, while the other penetrated the hull without detonating its warhead. But the explosion of the missile's residual fuel was enough to set off a fire which raged through the Sheffield's hull.</p> <p>Yarmouth helped to fight the blaze from starboard while the Arrow took up position on the port side. Several other ships came up in support. The battle lasted for many hours as a huge pall of black smoke formed the destroyer's funeral pyre.</p> <p>With the flames drawing nearer to the magazines, the Sheffield's captain, Sam Salt, decided to abandon ship.

      "bodyText": "After 26 years in the Royal Navy, Captain Paul Bootherstone, who has died of a heart attack aged 62, faced the supreme test of his career in the Falklands war of 1982. He won the Distinguished Service Cross as commander of HMS Arrow, the frigate that rescued the crew of the doomed destroyer Sheffield. Both ships were in the first wave of the 27-warship task force sent to the south Atlantic after the Argentine invasion on April 2. Arrow was one of an eventual total of 10 escorts with the carrier task group formed to seize control - with alarmingly slender resources - of the 200-mile exclusion zone around the islands. The frigate fired the first shot in a bombardment of Port Stanley airfield on May 1. Arrow was also the first British ship to be hit by the daring Argentine pilots who, flying at the very limit of their range, constituted the main threat to the expedition. One sailor was wounded and the ship lightly damaged. The bizarre conflict passed the diplomatic point of no return the next day, when the nuclear attack submarine HMS Conqueror sank the old cruiser General Belgrano outside the zone, with the loss of more than 350 men. On May 4, determined to exact revenge, the Argentine navy sent two Super-Etendard bombers against part of the task force commander Rear-Admiral Sandy Woodward's screen. These were the type 21 frigates, Arrow and Yarmouth, and type 42 destroyer Sheffield, patrolling between 40 and 70 miles south of Stanley and helping to cover the aircraft carriers Hermes and Invincible a further 40 miles out. Each French-built Super-Etendard carried one Exocet missile. Both targeted the anti-aircraft ship Sheffield. One missed, while the other penetrated the hull without detonating its warhead. But the explosion of the missile's residual fuel was enough to set off a fire which raged through the Sheffield's hull. Yarmouth helped to fight the blaze from starboard while the Arrow took up position on the port side. Several other ships came up in support. The battle lasted for many hours as a huge pall of black smoke formed the destroyer's funeral pyre. With the flames drawing nearer to the magazines, the Sheffield's captain, Sam Salt, decided to abandon ship. HMS Arrow could easily have been damaged or even sunk by an ammunition explosion, but Bootherstone lifted 225 of the 266 survivors by skilful manoeuvring to enable them to jump the gap between the two bows; only 20 men were killed and 24 wounded. Six days later, on May 10, Arrow sailed in support of her sister Alacrity in a northward sweep up the sound between East and West Falkland and was fired upon by the modern, German-built submarine San Luis, whose torpedo smashed Arrow's towed decoy. The strains of service in the stormy South Atlantic added to Bootherstone's woes, exposing serious design and construction faults including hull cracks and many mechanical problems.

      "trailText": "The traumatic events of the past few weeks have put great pressure on everybody within the industry and have evoked great sympathy throughout the country.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The traumatic events of the past few weeks have put great pressure on everybody within the industry and have evoked great sympathy throughout the country.</p> <p>I appreciate that some of you will have suffered the terrible consequences of an outbreak on your farms. Others will be waiting anxiously as we fight the disease.</p> <p>I assure you that we are doing everything within our power to get the industry back to normal as quickly as possible. This will still be a long haul.</p> <p><b>Origins and Disease Spread</b></p> <p>It is likely that the outbreak originated at a pig farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland.</p> <p>The subsequent spread of infection is traceable to some extent. Virus from the source farm spread to seven other farms in Tyne and Wear. Sheep from one of these farms were sent to Hexham market on 13 February. Sheep from the 13 February market at Hexham were sent to markets at Longtown and were further dispersed between 14-24 February.</p> <p>Within days, before any suspicion of the disease had been reported, infected sheep were criss-crossing the country in hundreds of separate movements, putting them into contact with other livestock.</p> <p>The 1967 outbreak was very different. It mainly affected pigs and cattle. But this outbreak quickly spread to sheep, which made the course of the infection more difficult to trace. The strain of the virus we are currently dealing with does not manifest itself clearly in sheep - even apparently healthy animals may be disease carriers.</p> <p>The course of the disease has shown how critical animal movements can be to the spread of FMD. It is obviously essential that everyone observes the very tight restrictions which we have had to place on animal movements in the interests of controlling disease. And if you fail to comply with licensing requirements you could be subject to prosecution and penalties.</p> <p>Taking account of what we have learned from this outbreak, the government is consulting on proposals to ban the feeding of swill to pigs, and to introduce limitations on the movements of cattle, sheep and goats.</p> <p><b>Strategy</b></p> <p>Our strategy remains focused on three key priorities:</p> <p>Firstly, all animals on infected farms - cattle, sheep and pigs - are to be slaughtered within 24 hours of the infection report.</p> <p>Secondly, all animals on contiguous premises (i.e. all farms neighbouring an infected premises) are then to be slaughtered within 48 hours.</p> <p>Thirdly, in the heavily infected area of Cumbria we are seeking to remove all sheep and pigs within 3km of infected premises. We are concentrating our efforts on clearing all animals identified for slaughter in the Solway area, and on the southern edge of the infected zone as well as on culling all animals which may have been exposed to the disease.</p> <p>We need your co operation if the strategy is to succeed.</p> <p>We are devoting massive resources to fighting the disease, including full use of the Army's resources and a new network of regional operations directors. There are now over 1500 soldiers working on disease control: at Great Orton, a burial pit the size of 64 football pitches was dug and in use within three days. We also have over 1500 vets in the front line - compared with the normal 220.</p> <p>The advice of independent scientists, led by the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, suggests that while it is too early to make firm predictions the signs are encouraging. It is particularly important to ensure that slaughtering on contiguous premises is accomplished within 48 hours.</p> <p><b>Vaccination</b></p> <p>We have carefully considered the possibility of using vaccination to help damp down the disease and protect cattle in the heavily infected areas of Cumbria. We were particularly concerned that turning out cattle during the next few weeks would leave them open to infection particularly if they mixed with sheep.</p> <p>Discussions with the NFU and other farmer's representatives, however, suggested that this could be managed by keeping cattle housed longer and ensuring that they do not graze with sheep. I enclose urgent guidance on how to prevent the spread of the disease from sheep to cattle. This advice has been produced in partnership with the British Cattle Veterinary Association, The Sheep Veterinary Society, the National Sheep Association, and the National Farmers Union. The government intends to publish separate advice for the general public about how FMD is spread, likely to appear in the next few days.</p> <p>The government has not ruled out vaccination but it is not an easy option.</p> <p><b> Compensation</b></p> <p>The government is committed to supporting the farming industry. Since 1997, this government has injected some \u00a31.2bn into the agriculture industry on top of the \u00a33bn annual CAP payments, and paid \u00a3786m agrimonetary compensation.</p> <p>We have also done a great deal to help farmers financially during this crisis . This includes full compensation for animals slaughtered on disease grounds estimated to be worth \u00a3200m to producers so far. I enclose a summary of the position for payment of agrimonetary compensation - which is worth, for example, \u00a32750 to the average dairy farmer.</p> <p>In addition, we have opened the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme as a last resort for livestock farmers whose animals face welfare difficulties as a result of FMD-related movement restrictions. The scheme provides for the removal and disposal of animals, with a generous scale of compensation payments.</p> <p>We also intend to make full use of CAP subsidy entitlements under EU rules on force majeure. Where animals have been slaughtered compulsorily because they are infected, are dangerous contacts or are part of a cull of animals which may have been exposed to the disease, subsidies validly claimed before 22 February will be paid in full. There may be other cases where force majeure may apply if producers have been unable to comply with CAP rules and you should notify your RSC in writing within ten days. We will be writing to all livestock producers shortly with more detailed information.</p> <p>We are also streamlining the valuation of animals by giving farmers the option of payment at a standard rate tariff or an individual valuation without affecting their right of appeal against valuation - even when the animal has been culled.</p> <p>We are doing everything within our power to deploy enough resources to meet the unprecedented demands on the Ministry's staff and ensure that these payments are paid as promptly as possible.</p> <p><b>Alternative land use</b></p> <p>Farmers on infected premises, whose stock has been slaughtered, regularly ask whether their land can be put to an alternative use - such as the growing of crops. In theory there is no reason why this can't take place. I recognise that the movement restrictions imposed on infected premises may make things difficult - particularly if contractors have to be brought in to take work forward. As we move towards lifting the restrictions on infected premises following disinfection this might become easier.</p> <p><b>Helplines</b></p> <p>We do understand the anguish that this disease is causing. This can result stress or business and financial difficulties. A range of organisation can provide help and support. I have attached to this letter a comprehensive list of national support helplines together with some useful local contact numbers.</p> <p><b>Agrimonetary compensation</b></p> <p>The \u00a3156m in optional agrimonetary compensation is split between the sectors as follows:</p> <p>Beef: \u00a357m Sheep: \u00a320m Dairy: \u00a379m</p> <p>On average it is worth some \u00a32,750 to the average dairy farmer, \u00a3650 to sheep farmers, \u00a3650 to suckler cow premium claimants and \u00a3450 to beef special premium claimants. We will be paying this money as quickly as we can under the EU rules. The Intervention Board are writing to all eligible producers with the payment dates for dairy agrimonetary compensation. For beef and sheep producers we will start payments on the following basis:</p> <p>Beef - compensation for market support equals \u00a333m and will be paid from April 2001, to recipients of 2000 beef scheme payments.</p> <p>Beef -

      "bodyText": "The traumatic events of the past few weeks have put great pressure on everybody within the industry and have evoked great sympathy throughout the country. I appreciate that some of you will have suffered the terrible consequences of an outbreak on your farms. Others will be waiting anxiously as we fight the disease. I assure you that we are doing everything within our power to get the industry back to normal as quickly as possible. This will still be a long haul. Origins and Disease Spread It is likely that the outbreak originated at a pig farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland. The subsequent spread of infection is traceable to some extent. Virus from the source farm spread to seven other farms in Tyne and Wear. Sheep from one of these farms were sent to Hexham market on 13 February. Sheep from the 13 February market at Hexham were sent to markets at Longtown and were further dispersed between 14-24 February. Within days, before any suspicion of the disease had been reported, infected sheep were criss-crossing the country in hundreds of separate movements, putting them into contact with other livestock. The 1967 outbreak was very different. It mainly affected pigs and cattle. But this outbreak quickly spread to sheep, which made the course of the infection more difficult to trace. The strain of the virus we are currently dealing with does not manifest itself clearly in sheep - even apparently healthy animals may be disease carriers. The course of the disease has shown how critical animal movements can be to the spread of FMD. It is obviously essential that everyone observes the very tight restrictions which we have had to place on animal movements in the interests of controlling disease. And if you fail to comply with licensing requirements you could be subject to prosecution and penalties. Taking account of what we have learned from this outbreak, the government is consulting on proposals to ban the feeding of swill to pigs, and to introduce limitations on the movements of cattle, sheep and goats. Strategy Our strategy remains focused on three key priorities: Firstly, all animals on infected farms - cattle, sheep and pigs - are to be slaughtered within 24 hours of the infection report. Secondly, all animals on contiguous premises (i.e. all farms neighbouring an infected premises) are then to be slaughtered within 48 hours. Thirdly, in the heavily infected area of Cumbria we are seeking to remove all sheep and pigs within 3km of infected premises. We are concentrating our efforts on clearing all animals identified for slaughter in the Solway area, and on the southern edge of the infected zone as well as on culling all animals which may have been exposed to the disease. We need your co operation if the strategy is to succeed. We are devoting massive resources to fighting the disease, including full use of the Army's resources and a new network of regional operations directors. There are now over 1500 soldiers working on disease control: at Great Orton, a burial pit the size of 64 football pitches was dug and in use within three days. We also have over 1500 vets in the front line - compared with the normal 220. The advice of independent scientists, led by the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, suggests that while it is too early to make firm predictions the signs are encouraging. It is particularly important to ensure that slaughtering on contiguous premises is accomplished within 48 hours. Vaccination We have carefully considered the possibility of using vaccination to help damp down the disease and protect cattle in the heavily infected areas of Cumbria. We were particularly concerned that turning out cattle during the next few weeks would leave them open to infection particularly if they mixed with sheep. Discussions with the NFU and other farmer's representatives, however, suggested that this could be managed by keeping cattle housed longer and ensuring that they do not graze with sheep. I enclose urgent guidance on how to prevent the spread of the disease from sheep to cattle. This advice has been produced in partnership with the British Cattle Veterinary Association, The Sheep Veterinary Society, the National Sheep Association, and the National Farmers Union. The government intends to publish separate advice for the general public about how FMD is spread, likely to appear in the next few days. The government has not ruled out vaccination but it is not an easy option. Compensation The government is committed to supporting the farming industry. Since 1997, this government has injected some \u00a31.2bn into the agriculture industry on top of the \u00a33bn annual CAP payments, and paid \u00a3786m agrimonetary compensation. We have also done a great deal to help farmers financially during this crisis . This includes full compensation for animals slaughtered on disease grounds estimated to be worth \u00a3200m to producers so far. I enclose a summary of the position for payment of agrimonetary compensation - which is worth, for example, \u00a32750 to the average dairy farmer. In addition, we have opened the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme as a last resort for livestock farmers whose animals face welfare difficulties as a result of FMD-related movement restrictions. The scheme provides for the removal and disposal of animals, with a generous scale of compensation payments. We also intend to make full use of CAP subsidy entitlements under EU rules on force majeure. Where animals have been slaughtered compulsorily because they are infected, are dangerous contacts or are part of a cull of animals which may have been exposed to the disease, subsidies validly claimed before 22 February will be paid in full. There may be other cases where force majeure may apply if producers have been unable to comply with CAP rules and you should notify your RSC in writing within ten days. We will be writing to all livestock producers shortly with more detailed information. We are also streamlining the valuation of animals by giving farmers the option of payment at a standard rate tariff or an individual valuation without affecting their right of appeal against valuation - even when the animal has been culled. We are doing everything within our power to deploy enough resources to meet the unprecedented demands on the Ministry's staff and ensure that these payments are paid as promptly as possible. Alternative land use Farmers on infected premises, whose stock has been slaughtered, regularly ask whether their land can be put to an alternative use - such as the growing of crops. In theory there is no reason why this can't take place. I recognise that the movement restrictions imposed on infected premises may make things difficult - particularly if contractors have to be brought in to take work forward. As we move towards lifting the restrictions on infected premises following disinfection this might become easier. Helplines We do understand the anguish that this disease is causing. This can result stress or business and financial difficulties. A range of organisation can provide help and support. I have attached to this letter a comprehensive list of national support helplines together with some useful local contact numbers. Agrimonetary compensation The \u00a3156m in optional agrimonetary compensation is split between the sectors as follows: Beef: \u00a357m Sheep: \u00a320m Dairy: \u00a379m On average it is worth some \u00a32,750 to the average dairy farmer, \u00a3650 to sheep farmers, \u00a3650 to suckler cow premium claimants and \u00a3450 to beef special premium claimants. We will be paying this money as quickly as we can under the EU rules. The Intervention Board are writing to all eligible producers with the payment dates for dairy agrimonetary compensation. For beef and sheep producers we will start payments on the following basis: Beef - compensation for market support equals \u00a333m and will be paid from April 2001, to recipients of 2000 beef scheme payments. Beef - compensation for direct aid equals \u00a315m and will be paid from October 2001, to recipients of 2000 beef scheme payments. Beef - compensation for direct aid equals \u00a39m and payments will be paid with 2001 scheme payments, which begin in the Autumn of 2001. Sheep - compensation for direct aid equals \u00a315m and will be paid from mid-April 2001, to recipients of 1999 scheme payments Sheep - compensation for direct aid equals \u00a35m and will be paid from mid-April 2001, to recipients of 2000 scheme payments We are doing our best to get this money to you as soon as possible.

Ms Ho-Phang said the Banyan Tree group had not signed an official contract with R-JH, but had been in direct negotiations with the Countess for the past month about using her agency. Incredibly, though, the Banyan Tree already appears at the top of R-JH's client list. The PR company's website boasts it has been hired to \"raise consumer awareness of the Banyan Tree brand (Asia's leading resort) in the UK\". And comments made by Mr Harkin to the undercover reporter imply a much closer relationship with the hotel group than actually existed. Asked for advice about visiting Thailand, Mr Harkin asks: \"Do you want me to talk to the Banyan Tree, if you're going to Phuket? I can say to them that I want these people to be looked after.\" Later, asked whether Phuket is the best place to go, he says: \"If you want young boys go to Phuket.\" Asked whether he knows of any houses that could be hired for the purpose, Mr Harkin says: \"That would be much better. In fact, I can ask the Banyan Tree, 'Could you recommend me, I need a very discreet villa'.\" Ms Ho-Phang said she had written personally to the Countess of Wessex asking her to explain her actions. The Banyan Tree group is now talking to other UK PR agencies about its business. The company is keen to raise its profile in this country, although the publicity it has received over the past few days will hardly have been what it had in mind when it decided to hire a PR agency.

      "bodyText": "The government today fired its latest salvo in the war against drugs with a \u00a3220m fund aimed at creating a network of regional partnerships to help fight drug related crime. The scheme - the money for which was first announced in the chancellor's budget last month - will see 376 local initiatives funded over the next three years as part of the government's \"communities against drugs\" campaign. Manchester United star Andy Cole and manager Sir Alex Ferguson will today pledge their support for the scheme at a meeting with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the cabinet office minister, Ian McCartney, in Manchester. Mr Straw said: \"The funding that we are announcing today will make a real difference to hundreds of communities across the country and the money will allow local solutions to local problems. He expected the cash to be spent on equipment like mobile police stations and schemes to set up more police bases in shopping centres. Security cameras, security lighting and so called \"private policemen\" or neighbourhood wardens could also be recruited. The home secretary pledged the funds would be \"available quickly without a long-winded bidding process.\" The package would concentrate on highly addictive class A drugs like heroin and cocaine, added Mr Straw. Mr McCartney made an impassioned speech in support of today's announcement. His son Hugh, 23, died after a heroin overdose in September 1999, and Mr McCartney spoke with emotion about the damage caused to families by drugs. \"No longer can we simply leave it to the police. The police need the eyes and ears of the community,\" he said. \"Drugs weaken and damage and even destroy communities. They certainly weaken and damage families who have lost children to drugs. It's difficult enough having someone in your family die but to lose a child in these circumstances is extremely difficult to cope with. \"It's not just the loss of their life but the loss of the life to come.\" He gave his backing to the sporting projects which will attempt to draw young people away from a life of crime and drug abuse by encouraging them to take part in sporting and education projects. Asked whether there was any evidence that such schemes had any effect, Mr McCartney said 28 pilot projects had shown positive results. Youngsters who are disillusioned, disenfranchised and without role models in life are granted something to aim for, he said. \"It gives them an opportunity to engage with someone locally who they do look up to. Some of these children are really talented but they did not even realise they had any talent.\" Among the likely initiatives to receive the funding are police operations that target specific drug problems such as Scotland Yard's current clampdown on crack cocaine houses in London. Other schemes include mobile police stations in rural areas where there are drug problems and centres of education for former and recovering drugs abusers. Home Office figures show that the cost of crimes committed to feed addicts' habits each year is \u00a32.5bn and 12,250 suspected offenders are arrested every week who have taken heroin cocaine or crack in the previous 48 hours. And an independent study estimated that half of criminals entering prison had a serious drugs problem. Earlier this year the government's drug tsar Keith Hellawell announced every local authority in the country was to appoint a drugs co-ordinater to identify potential problems and local hotspots.

El mes pasado m\u00e1s de cincuenta autobuses y camiones formaron una caravana para ir del estado de Chiapas, al sur de M\u00e9xico, hasta Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. M\u00e1s de 3.000 kil\u00f3metros y dos semanas de ruta en defensa de una ley de autonom\u00eda para diez millones de ind\u00edgenas. El \"subcomandante\" Marcos, con su pasamonta\u00f1as y su pipa, tambi\u00e9n estaba. En 1994 la guerrilla del EZLN inici\u00f3 una revoluci\u00f3n con armas en el estado de Chiapas. Ahora sus armas son las palabras. La caravana lleg\u00f3 hasta la tribuna del Congreso de los diputados. Y la comandante Ester pidi\u00f3 autonom\u00eda para las comunidades ind\u00edgenas dentro de M\u00e9xico pero sin fragmentar la integridad territorial.

But of those, 65% had cancelled their plans because of foot and mouth.</p> <p>Respondents had voiced a demand for clear, practical information about what visitors can still do in the countryside and where.</p> <p>The organisation's head of membership David Hellard said: \"The overall impact of foot and mouth on the rural tourist trade has been widely noted, but our findings really bring home just how hard the industry is going to be hit over what is traditionally an extremely busy holiday period.\" New, unexpected outbreaks were confirmed yesterday, dampening hopes that the disease was coming under control.</p> <p>An outbreak in the village of Nelson - 20 miles from the nearest case in Monmouthshire - was one of two confirmed in Wales yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Brown today claimed the next few days are likely to form a \"clear trend\" for how the foot and mouth crisis will progress.</p> <p>The new outbreaks appearing in areas previously unaffected should be \"stamped on\" quickly through the slaughter policy, he said.</p> <p>\"I would expect by the end of this week for a clear trend to be discernible. But whichever way it is going, let me make it absolutely clear that there can be no room for complacency,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have to remain vigilant until we have this terrible disease outbreak brought to a firm conclusion.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, two of Britain's largest supermarket groups were today celebrating a surge in profits despite the foot and mouth crisis. Profits at market leader Tesco are forecast to break the \u00a31bn barrier tomorrow while Sainsbury's announced a 4.8% increase in like-for-like sales for the first three months of the year.</p> <p>The National Farmers' Union today declined to comment on the figures.</p> <p>Farmers have consistently complained of being sold short by the big chains which they say operate a price stranglehold on the meat market.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br> <br> <b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br> <b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470556,00.html\">09.04.2001: Councils refusing to reopen footpaths</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,470612,00.html\">09.04.2001: Hopes raised as figures for new cases stay stable</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>More on the countryside in crisis</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463746,00.html\">27.03.2001: Hard times</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463588,00.html\">28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463571,00.html\">18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463578,00.html\"> 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463596,00.html\">11.11.1967: Emigrant flights to Australia stopped by foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,463559,00.html\">01.11.1967: It is cheaper to kill than to prevent cattle disease</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map: The spread of the disease (week 4)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Cartoons</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464422,00.html\">Steve Bell on how pigs will fly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,463874,00.html\">Steve Bell on Hague going over the top</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs -

      "bodyText": "Farmers affected by the foot and mouth crisis have been allocated more than \u00a3600m in compensation, Nick Brown was expected to announce today. In a statement to the House of Commons, the agriculture minister was expected to tell MPs that more than \u00a3247m of that figure is direct compensation for slaughtered animals. But the results of a survey released today have stoked fears that the rural tourist trade could suffer further losses as people cancel Easter breaks over fears of foot and mouth. NFU Countryside, an affiliate organisation to the National Farmers' Union, found that 66% of just over 500 visitors to its website who were questioned indicated that they were planning to take a countryside break over Easter. But of those, 65% had cancelled their plans because of foot and mouth. Respondents had voiced a demand for clear, practical information about what visitors can still do in the countryside and where. The organisation's head of membership David Hellard said: \"The overall impact of foot and mouth on the rural tourist trade has been widely noted, but our findings really bring home just how hard the industry is going to be hit over what is traditionally an extremely busy holiday period.\" New, unexpected outbreaks were confirmed yesterday, dampening hopes that the disease was coming under control. An outbreak in the village of Nelson - 20 miles from the nearest case in Monmouthshire - was one of two confirmed in Wales yesterday. Mr Brown today claimed the next few days are likely to form a \"clear trend\" for how the foot and mouth crisis will progress. The new outbreaks appearing in areas previously unaffected should be \"stamped on\" quickly through the slaughter policy, he said. \"I would expect by the end of this week for a clear trend to be discernible. But whichever way it is going, let me make it absolutely clear that there can be no room for complacency,\" he said. \"We have to remain vigilant until we have this terrible disease outbreak brought to a firm conclusion.\" Meanwhile, two of Britain's largest supermarket groups were today celebrating a surge in profits despite the foot and mouth crisis. Profits at market leader Tesco are forecast to break the \u00a31bn barrier tomorrow while Sainsbury's announced a 4.8% increase in like-for-like sales for the first three months of the year. The National Farmers' Union today declined to comment on the figures. Farmers have consistently complained of being sold short by the big chains which they say operate a price stranglehold on the meat market.

For Gui Chan, the dream was always the same: he would make his way from a dingy bedsit in Birmingham to Chinatown in central London where Quan, his younger brother, would be waiting to meet him. </p> <p>After embracing, the brothers would head for an evening train to Birmingham. Within hours, they would be discussing their plans for a life in Britain and drinking to memories of their childhood in China's Fujian province. </p> <p>It was not to be. Instead, Chan was this weekend reflecting on the harrowing last moments of his brother's life and regretting the day he suggested paying the people-smugglers known as 'snake heads' to get him from China to Europe. </p> <p>While Gui Chan had successfully made it two years earlier, it was only a matter of time before the journey undertaken by thousands of immigrants each year ended in tragedy. On 18 June last year, Quan and 57 other Chinese suffocated in a lorry on its way by ferry to Dover. </p> <p>Last week, Perry Wacker, a 33-year-old Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter. It emerged that after boarding the ferry at Zeebrugge for the five-hour crossing, he had deliberately shut off the only air vent to stop noise from filtering out. It was the hottest night of the year. </p> <p>At Dover, Wacker's Mercedes-Benz truck was opened up by customs officers. Corpses, including Quan's, littered the cramped container. Most of the victims had torn their clothes off; others had tried to claw their way out. Two had survived, though they were barely alive. </p> <p>Most of the victims had paid up to \u00a320,000 to end up in the back of Wacker's lorry. With 60 people crammed inside, the 'snakeheads' had already collected \u00a31.2m million from the human cargo. Wacker's cut was \u00a3500 for each person he successfully delivered, netting a payout of \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Gui Chan spoke with sadness last week about how he had convinced his brother to take a fatal chance. Now in hiding after helping Kent police with their investigation, he says the advice he gave Quan still haunts him. </p> <p>In Budapest, the Hungarian capital, Quan had been detained by immigration officials. But the 'snakeheads' secured his release from a refugee detention centre after apparently paying an official and he called his brother for advice on his next move. Last week, as Gui sat in the office of a London lawyer, he sobbed as he told how he had advised his brother to head for Britain. 'You have no choice in Budapest,' he told Quan. 'You have to move on. There is no way back once you reach Hungary. And there is no way to know your fate from there on.' </p> <p>Gui, 38, leaving behind his wife and two children, agreed to pay \u00a39,000 to go to Hungary in 1998. In a small hotel in Beijing, the criminal gang behind the scheme gave him a false passport, with an immaculate visa stamp for entrance into Hungary. He said he asked no questions and boarded the Aeroflot plane to Budapest. </p> <p>The Chinese market in the east of Pest is full of immigrants in search of home comforts as well as passage to the UK. The immaculate visas Gui and his brother received were obtained through a network of 'snakehead' contacts in Hungary. A source at the visa department of the Ministry for the Interior told The Observer last week how Chinese businessmen court visa workers. 'They give workers mobile phones, just so they can call them up and ask for \"help\",' said a source. 'They buy them meals and gifts - rarely giving them money at first. It's simple to issue a visa through official channels, but never record its existence.' </p> <p>Gui said he waited days in a half-way house in Budapest before being packed on to a lorry heading west. The lorry stopped and the group was marched across mountains into what was probably Austria. There, two men with hunting rifles loaded them on to another truck. </p> <p>After arriving in Kent, Gui telephoned his family in Fujian who paid the gang for transporting him to the UK a total of \u00a317,000. He was marched to a waiting taxi which took him to Chinatown in London. After a series of manual jobs he found work with a building company in Birmingham while his asylum application was considered. </p> <p>When Quan died, it was Gui who broke the news to the family. The body was shipped back to China, among 58 wooden coffins laid out on the tarmac of Beijing airport. </p> <p>For Gui, the future is uncertain. His asylum application is not guaranteed and his testimony to police means that, if the snakeheads catch up with him, he faces death or injury. 'I was so desperate to leave China. You have no option with the government on your back. After my brother's death, the situation in China was exposed. But, since I have spoken out, the snakeheads have been looking for me. Their grip never seems to end.' </p> <p>Pal Nyiri, a senior research fellow at Oxford University, said: 'The Chinese do not normally fear the people who arrange the trip. They are providing a service. Yes, it is expensive and sometimes dangerous, but it is an investment the Chinese think they can recoup from working in a better economy.' </p> <p>He added: 'Few Chinese are surprised at being threatened when they don't pay up. In their minds, they have reneged on the deal. After all, it was not the snakeheads who killed the 58 people, it was the man who closed the vent.'</p>",

He added: 'Few Chinese are surprised at being threatened when they don't pay up. In their minds, they have reneged on the deal. After all, it was not the snakeheads who killed the 58 people, it was the man who closed the vent.'",

      "body": "<p>Hang on a moment! Have Britain's newspapers really devoted countless pages for eight days to trivial statements made - and, in some instances, not made - by the wife of the fourth child of the monarch? Oh yes, they have. </p> <p>Compared to the previous taped royal intimacies of Camillagate and Squidgygate, Sophiegate is tame stuff, but it illustrates two truths, palatable or unpalatable, according to one's views on royalty. One, the royal family's public standing is now so fragile that it can be destabilised by a couple of Sunday tabloids in pursuit of a minor indiscretion by a woman married to the seventh in line to the throne. Two, the press, suffering from a post-Diana dearth of palace tittle-tattle, will now pull at any thread in the royal fabric in its desperation for headlines. </p> <p>But what is truth? From the moment the story of the Countess of Wessex and the Sheikh of Wapping broke, there has been a farrago of rumour, speculation and fantasy of which virtually every newspaper should be ashamed. I have pieced together what I believe to be a definitive account of the whole tawdry tale that debunks some of the week's most far-fetched, and oft-repeated, allegations and fanciful conspiracy theories floated by apparently experienced commentators. </p> <p>The saga began towards the end of February at R-JH, the public relations company run by the countess and Murray Harkin. A disaffected employee, account manager Kishan Athulathmudali, decided he had an explosive inside story to tell. </p> <p>There are two contrasting versions of what happened next and since each side swears theirs is the correct one, I'll report both. According to the News of the World, Kishan first contacted its investigations department, headed by Mazher Mahmood. He didn't ask for money. He just wanted the world to know that the countess was using her royal connections to drum up business for her company. Then, at some time during the debriefing process, Kishan took fright and decamped to the welcoming arms of Max Clifford. </p> <p>According to Clifford, confirmed in Kishan's legal deposition sent to R-JH lawyers, Kishan went straight to him almost seven weeks ago, long before he met Mahmood. He listened to Kishan's story and thought the most appropriate paper to run it was the Mail on Sunday. The paper's chief reporter, Fiona Barton, then spent three hours with Kishan at Clifford's West End office and, some days later, Clifford was surprised when the MoS rejected the idea of buying the story. Evidently, Barton did not want to rely on Kishan as a witness. Clifford then introduced Kishan to Mahmood, and both parties agree what happened from this point on: Kishan spoke not only of the countess trading on her royal links, but also made accusations about Harkin's private life. </p> <p>Mahmood's team of spies and assorted poseurs then set about pulling off one of their notorious sting operations. Their bait: a potentially lucrative deal to promote a new leisure centre in Dubai. Their main target: Harkin. Their public-interest defence for using subterfuge: if what was alleged was true, he was not an appropriate person to work with a royal. Inside R-JH, the path was smoothed by Kishan, who assured Harkin and Rhys-Jones that he had checked the fake sheikh's bona fides. </p> <p>There were two hotel meetings in early March between the robed \"Sheikh Mohammed\" - one of Mahmood's cronies - and Harkin, but he wasn't lured into making any sensational incriminating statements. </p> <p>A frustrated Mahmood, playing the role of the sheikh's assistant, pushed Harkin hard. Asked about \"rumours\" involving Prince Edward, for instance, Harkin replied: \"I'm a great believer that there's no smoke without fire.\" Questioned about drugs, Harkin did admit that he quite liked \"the odd line of coke\" and had taken ecstasy a couple of years ago. He was similarly vague when asked whether he knew how to hire male prostitutes. In the jargon of hacks who perpetrate these entrapment techniques, Harkin just \"wouldn't play\". He had not said anything good enough to publish. Then he suddenly gave the gloomy eavesdroppers a reason to smile. Next time we meet, he suggested, perhaps the countess should come along. </p> <p>Mahmood quickly organised lunch at the Dorchester Hotel on March 14, and the single prior request made by R-JH was a fax of the menu. Harkin and Rhys-Jones were still reliant on Kishan's word, and the only means they had of contacting the sheikh was a mobile phone number. </p> <p>Mahmood was again in western attire, as was the bogus sheikh, who had previously worn a rather fetching ankle-length thawb for the meetings with Harkin. Initially, Rhys-Jones was as careful as her partner, reminding her Arab hosts that they must regard R-JH in the same light as any other PR company. But it wasn't long before she became less guarded, gossiping about members of the royal family and politicians. </p> <p>Much of what she said was both indiscreet and crass. She referred to the prime minister as \"President Blair\", suggested that William Hague \"sounds like a puppet\" and confided that Charles and Camilla were \"possibly number one on people's unpopular people list\". These were balanced by very complimentary comments about Hague and the prince. Perhaps her most tactless comment, breaking royal protocol on political neutrality, was about Gordon Brown's budget being \"a load of pap\". </p> <p>Despite her apparent ease at that lunch, when Rhys-Jones returned to her office she was suspicious enough to demand another check on the sheikh and gradually realised she had been duped. Recalling what she and Harkin had said, or what they thought they had said, she then alerted Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the NoW, there was, surprisingly, no clinking of champagne glasses. After reading a transcript of the tapes, editor Rebekah Wade wasn't sure the material was strong enough to publish. There was evidence of a blurring of the line between Rhys-Jones's PR business interests and her membership of the royal family, but was there enough? </p> <p>She certainly appeared to be exploiting her position, and Harkin had confessed to personal misdemeanours, but Wade was oddly hesitant. Her legal advisers were also worried whether the use of subterfuge might be challenged as \"a fishing expedition\", and therefore fall foul of the Press Complaints Commission. </p> <p>Once the identity of the sheikh became clear to Rhys-Jones, her company's lawyers moved swiftly, pursuing Kishan for breach of confidentiality, issuing an injunction against the News of the World which required the paper to hand over tapes and transcripts. Other papers, as a matter of course, also received injunctions. </p> <p>At the palace, communications director Simon Walker called PCC chairman Lord Wakeham in some alarm. He explained that he and the Queen's private secretary, Sir Robin Janvrin, urgently needed advice, so the following day, March 21, Wakeham and PCC director Guy Black visited them at the palace. (Some people might think that an ordinary member of the public would not get such attention from the PCC, and some people would be right.) </p> <p>In what was supposed to be a confidential conversation, Wakeham and Black stuck to their usual script. The palace had two choices: to let the paper do its worst and complain after publication, or to contact the editor and, in Wakeham's words, \"see if some accommodation could be reached\". It would appear from the nature of this conversation that R-JH's lawyers had already conceded that they could not prevent the NoW from publishing. </p> <p>Despite widespread speculation to the contrary, I am convinced that Wakeham and Black did not specifically suggest a deal, and certainly did not broker one. As far as they were concerned, the ball was in the palace's court and Walker, misreading the advice about \"accommodation\", then made a terrible mistake. He called Wade and, to her shock and delight, made her an offer she couldn't refuse. </p> <p>In return for agreeing not to publish the material obtained at the hotel, the NoW could have an exclusive - and unprecedented - interview with the countess at Buckingham Palace. They would, of course, expect copy approval. Wade agreed, upsetting some of the more gung-ho members of staff who did not expect that an interview with a PR woman experienced in dealing with the press would yield much of a story. </p> <p>In fact, Rhys-Jones surprised the NoW's journalist, Carole Aye Maung. Without much prompting, she spoke about rumours about her husband's sexuality, providing the paper with a front-page headline: \"Sophie: My Edward is NOT gay\". Wade didn't think the palace would approve the copy, let alone the headline, and was astonished when Walker made only the most minor of changes. </p> <p>But Walker's headache was only just beginning. He was unaware that Rhys-Jones had written letters to the Blairs, Hague and Prince Charles apologising for what she might have said to the undercover reporters. On the day before publication, Saturday March 31, Walker received calls at about midday from the Mail on Sunday's Fiona Barton and the Sunday Mirror's Andy Buckwell. Both reporters claimed to know of indiscreet statements made by Rhys-Jones, but Walker did not appear to think that either had genuine evidence. </p> <p>When the first editions dropped that evening, Walker was shocked to read specific quotes attributed to Rhys-Jones which he had not read in the transcript of the hotel tapes and thought were untrue. According to the Mail on Sunday, Rhys-Jones had described Blair's wife, Cherie, as \"horrid, horrid, horrid\", had called the Queen an \"old dear\" and had referred to Hague as \"deformed\". He immediately drafted a statement denying the veracity of the allegations in the Mail on Sunday and Sunday Mirror and issued it to the Press Association. </p> <p> Some time later Walker discovered that PA was refusing to transmit the statement because, he was informed by a member of staff, it would upset a customer: the MoS. So he faxed his statement to as many Sunday papers as he could before, very late at night, finally speaking to a senior PA executive who countermanded the previous instruction. </p> <p>By Monday, the hapless Walker was in a terrible state. He began to brief journalists about the PCC having suggested the foolish deal, hinting that they might have brokered it. A furious Wakeham hit back, leading to a breach with the palace, only partially healed by diplomatic phone calls to Wakeham from Janvrin. Then Walker discovered his position was even more untenable when Rhys-Jones also refused to talk to him. He is clearly being lined up as the scapegoat for the whole episode and could well end up leaving his post earlier than expected. </p> <p>He certainly deserves some sympathy. In his previous job, as communications supremo at BA, he had a staff of 120. At the palace, he works with just three press officers. At BA, he had easy access to the chairman. At the palace, he is not in daily contact with the queen. That said, he was guilty of breathtaking naivety in his dealings with the NoW, as was Rhys-Jones. It's hard to believe they both earn their money from public relations. </p> <p>There are still many questions left to answer. Was there a genuine public interest that made it appropriate for the NoW to use subterfuge? Was the NoW right to renege on its deal with the palace by publishing 10 pages of the tape transcripts in yesterday's paper? Why didn't R-JH's lawyers seek a further injunction to prevent publication having issued one a week earlier? What was it about the material originally obtained by Mahmood that made Wade hesitant to publish in the first place? How did the MoS obtain such specific quotes which, as far as it is possible to judge, did not appear in the transcript? Why, if R-JH's lawyers knew that the MoS quotes were incorrect, did they not sue the paper? </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.rjhpr.co.uk\">R-JH public relations</a><br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/edward.htm\">Buckingham palace biography of Duke of Wessex</a><br><a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~royalty12/\">Sophie Wessex fan site</a></p>",

How did the MoS obtain such specific quotes which, as far as it is possible to judge, did not appear in the transcript?

      "bodyText": "New rights for mothers choosing to work part-time will be drawn up by an independent commission under plans being considered by Tony Blair. In an appeal to women voters, Labour is expected to back 'flexible working' in its election manifesto. But Downing Street, wary of a backlash from business, is seeking a compromise over calls for a legally enforceable right for women to reduce their hours after giving birth. The Prime Minister is locked in negotiations over whether the right should be compulsory or merely voluntary best practice for employers. One option is to propose new rights but promise that details of what they would include and when they would take effect would be left to an independent commission involving employers. Downing Street has already privately promised business leaders that there will be no new employment rights legislation for two years. 'This is the most important issue for most women at work - control over their hours - but it is also a huge challenge to business,' said Harriet Harman, the former Cabinet Minister who has been working closely on the proposals. 'My view is that we are likely to solve this problem. We don't want to ditch this, because it is too important, but neither will we charge headfirst into a row with business that can be avoided.' Research suggests many new mothers reluctantly give up work because they cannot juggle a full-time job and a baby, when they could have returned successfully from maternity leave had they been able to work part-time. A survey by the Equal Opportunities Commission found half of new mothers who sought to reduce their hours were refused. A legal right to flexible working was first floated by the Women's Ministers Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell, and taken up by Trade Secretary Stephen Byers in a recent Green Paper. Business protests convinced many at Westminster that the idea would be shelved. However, senior fig ures point out that business leaders fiercely opposed the minimum wage but now accept it. The creation of the independent Low Pay Commission to set a rate was pivotal in reassuring them, a tactic that could be repeated for flexible working. The issue has divided Downing Street's policy unit, with Geoff Norris, Blair's industry adviser, and Lord Haskins, the Labour-supporting tycoon who advises the Government on red tape, said to be resisting new legal rights. But Byers, Jay, Jowell, junior Employment Minister Margaret Hodge and policy unit adviser Carey Oppenheim have argued in favour. The decision is now said to be in the balance, but retreat risks a backlash from women voters already showing greater signs than men of disillusionment with Labour. Meanwhile the issue of working parents will rise up the political agenda on the eve of the election campaign, with Cherie Booth due to challenge her husband's Government over parental leave. She is due in court for the TUC next month to argue that millions of parents have been wrongly excluded from the promise of three months' unpaid time off. TUC general secretary John Monks called yesterday for the Government not to be 'so frightened' of business. The unions want unpaid parental leave - currently limited to those with children born after 15 December 1999 - extended to another 2.7 million parents of under-fives born before that date. Its case, led by Booth, will be heard by the European Court of Justice on 3 May. 'We do not understand why the Government is dragging out this case - every expert expects them to lose,' said Monks. 'You would think Ministers would see this as an ideal opportunity to demonstrate their child-friendly credentials before the election.' It is not the first time Booth has appeared in court against the Government - she uses the 'cab rank' principle of taking whichever cases come along - and famously appeared for the TUC weeks before giving birth to her son Leo. This case, however, falls at a particularly sensitive time.",

Since then we have launched an operational service, backed by a sophisticated and secure payments system. In doing so we have put together a high-quality team, though we do acknowledge one or two recruitment mistakes along the way. We also have a decent network of partners and a sizable user base.

Among Innovation 2000's targets are information and communication technology networks. The EIB is pledged to \"focus its lending in this field on innovative technology projects such as ADSL, XDSL and UMTS\". The strategy is a response to the EU's aim of making available \"in all European countries, high-speed interconnected networks for internet access and to foster the development of state of the art information technology and other telecom networks\". Third generation mobile telephone networks will allow users access to the internet through mobile telephones and were initially seen as a must-have asset for telecoms companies. The high cost of acquiring the licences in Britain and Germany and worries about how quickly the networks would deliver the revenues required to finance their cost prompted a rethink by some within the industry. Problems for telecoms companies have been compounded by the sharp fall in share prices in the technology sector which has hit hopes of financing the networks by selling stakes in subsidiary companies.

But, according to one, old habits die hard. \"The trouble is that the cuttings pack ministers receive each morning is culled from the nationals. Regional copy comes in piecemeal, and often several days late. And if they don't see their names and their faces straight away they get disheartened.\"",

So when Robin Cook added an ethical dimension to British policy in 1997, the Foreign Office's answer to Socrates seemed to be just asking for trouble. In the peripatetic school of modern politics, low-brow pedestrians of all parties, egged on by the press, were only too happy to put the boot in. What vain and foolish posturing, they cried. What hypocrisy! Mr Cook has been trying to act philosophical ever since.</p> <p>What is rarely, if ever, noted is that Mr Cook's attempt publicly to anchor policy in morality, while easily mocked and obviously imperfect, was a brave and creative step. The foreign secretary is said to believe that helping depose Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic is his most important achievement to date. But the emphasis he has placed on human rights may have a more lasting impact. No future British government will be able to ignore the much derided ethical dimension. Nor, as foreign policy is increasingly collectivised, will any other EU member state.</p> <p>In effect, Mr Cook has attempted that most difficult of things: to change attitudes. British diplomats now receive human rights training as a matter of course. Mr Cook has established de facto criteria by which all future policy will be judged, be it overseas arms sales, bilateral aid or humanitarian intervention. Britain has championed the UN's international criminal court. And in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, for example, Britain's actions have gone well beyond narrowly defined national interest. Its position was all the stronger for being morally justified.</p> <p>There remains plenty of cause for complaint, about lack of consistency and apparent blindspots. In a recent speech on the government's human rights record, Mr Cook criticised China's numerous abuses but made no reference to Russia's appalling behaviour in Chechnya. For many people, Mr Cook's words have not been reflected in policy in Iraq, in Kurdish areas of Turkey and in respect of Israel's conduct in Palestine. Draft arms exports regulations have been slow in coming and contain serious loopholes. And Britain is still reluctant to criticise Saudi Arabia and the US over such matters as the death penalty. But in a world mostly beyond Britain's control, Mr Cook's overall effort to raise expectations and set standards deserves support, not scorn.</p>",

What hypocrisy! Mr Cook has been trying to act philosophical ever since. What is rarely, if ever, noted is that Mr Cook's attempt publicly to anchor policy in morality, while easily mocked and obviously imperfect, was a brave and creative step. The foreign secretary is said to believe that helping depose Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic is his most important achievement to date. But the emphasis he has placed on human rights may have a more lasting impact. No future British government will be able to ignore the much derided ethical dimension. Nor, as foreign policy is increasingly collectivised, will any other EU member state. In effect, Mr Cook has attempted that most difficult of things: to change attitudes. British diplomats now receive human rights training as a matter of course. Mr Cook has established de facto criteria by which all future policy will be judged, be it overseas arms sales, bilateral aid or humanitarian intervention. Britain has championed the UN's international criminal court. And in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, for example, Britain's actions have gone well beyond narrowly defined national interest. Its position was all the stronger for being morally justified. There remains plenty of cause for complaint, about lack of consistency and apparent blindspots. In a recent speech on the government's human rights record, Mr Cook criticised China's numerous abuses but made no reference to Russia's appalling behaviour in Chechnya. For many people, Mr Cook's words have not been reflected in policy in Iraq, in Kurdish areas of Turkey and in respect of Israel's conduct in Palestine. Draft arms exports regulations have been slow in coming and contain serious loopholes. And Britain is still reluctant to criticise Saudi Arabia and the US over such matters as the death penalty. But in a world mostly beyond Britain's control, Mr Cook's overall effort to raise expectations and set standards deserves support, not scorn.",

Nine out of 10 councils shut almost all their rural paths when emergency restrictions were first declared last month. A survey of 69 councils found that eight out of 10 still have almost as many paths closed now. Seven in 10 councils are expected to persist in blanket re strictions by the Easter weekend when the tourist season takes off. Jacquetta Fewster, of the Ramblers' Association, said: \"It is atrocious that these councils can so casually ignore scientific fact and destroy the livelihoods of thousands of local people in the process. These paths need to be open by Easter.\" The walkers' charity described West Sussex, Lincolnshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex and Hertfordshire as among the \"worst offenders\" of the 171 councils with powers to close public rights of way. Almost two thirds of people who were planning a countryside holiday over the Easter break have cancelled their trips due to foot and mouth, according to a separate survey. A poll of 500 users of the NFU's Countryside website revealed a demand for clear, practical information about the options for holidaymakers.

Her Majesty accepts that despite the difficulties of recent days, both the earl and countess understandably want to try to pursue working careers and they have her full support in doing so. It is not an easy option and they are breaking new ground, but it is right in this day and age that they should be allowed to do so. In following careers they are always open to accusations of exploiting their royal status in pursuit of their own business interests. Both the earl and countess vigorously deny that they have deliberately set out to do so. The Queen deplores the entrapment, subterfuge, innuendo and untruths to which [they] have been subjected in recent days. The Queen recognises that there are and always have been real issues around ensuring and being seen to ensure that royal and business interests do not conflict where members of the royal family pursue their own careers. Ways to address and avoid such potential conflicts of interest need to be recognised... and this will be done over the coming weeks. \"Whilst this is undertaken, the Countess of Wessex has suggested, and the Queen has agreed, that [she] should step aside as chairman of RJH, as the issues facing the company are considered.\" The statement from the Countess of Wessex: This has been a difficult time for me. I take very seriously the issues raised, and, naturally, regret any embarrassment above all to the Queen. I am grateful for Her Majesty's support both on a personal level and for my being able to pursue a career. I believe my overriding duty is to support the Queen and the monarchy. I realise fully that I am in a privileged position, and I am conscious that my conduct must be above reproach. I am deeply distressed by the carrying out of an entrapment operation on me and my business but I also much regret my own misjudgment in succumbing to that subterfuge. I have discussed the situation with the Queen and I have decided to step aside as chairman of RJH while the issues raised by recent events are carefully considered. In view of this experience I need a period of time to reassess my own role. Over the past few days I have taken great comfort from the friendship and support of my colleagues at RJH and of our clients. I feel an obligation to them, and I believe a way can be found for RJH to continue as a successful company. Over the next few weeks the business will be restructured in order to allow this to happen.

That's his style.\" </p> <p>She goes on to brand the recent budget as \"a load of pap\" designed purely for election purposes. \"It's all promises,\" she says. \"And the increase in everybody's taxes is something frightening. Since the Labour party came to power, the man in the street is paying something like an additional 40% in tax. They've snuck in so much through the back door.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, she expresses sympathy for William Hague whom she describes as \"very intelligent\" with \"real vision\". </p> <p>But she dismisses his election chances, saying: \"He's got this awful kind of way he talks, like that all the time [mimics Hague] he sounds like a puppet unfortunately.\" </p> <p>The focus then shifts back to the royal family and the countess defends the Prince of Wales against a suggestion that he is \"too formal\". </p> <p>\"He's great fun, he really is. For instance, with William and Harry he's so laid back, I mean what you don't see is when the Prince of Wales is messing around and being funny and silly, he's a different person.\" </p> <p>She adds: \"He's a man who's always been ahead of his years all the way along. He was damned, a complete quack. People laughed at him for his views on architecture, but now they're starting to take notice.\" </p> <p>On the subject of Charles and Camilla, the countess admits the couple were unpopular at first but says Camilla is slowly being accepted. </p> <p>The countess later admits that it can prove difficult to juggle her professional and royal interests: \"...I'm not there to endorse other people's products on a commercial basis, that's not what it's about.\" </p> <p>However, she then adds: \"If anybody ever gets some kind of additional profile or benefit from being involved with us because of my situation, that's an unspoken benefit.

They have also, temporarily at least, cost her control of her company and her career as a PR executive. </p> <p>The countess was supposed to bring a new, modern career-girl business acumen to the royal family, with the added advantage of one versed in public relations skills, when she married the Queen's youngest son two years ago.

They have also, temporarily at least, cost her control of her company and her career as a PR executive. The countess was supposed to bring a new, modern career-girl business acumen to the royal family, with the added advantage of one versed in public relations skills, when she married the Queen's youngest son two years ago. Instead, the News of the World's sting operation revealed that she was prepared to sail close to the wind by trading on her royal associations in pursuit of a client, that she was happy to chatter away indiscreetly about sensitive political matters to someone she had only just met, and that she would bandy intimate matters about her husband's sexuality and her fertility even in a formal interview with the tabloid Sunday newspaper.

Changes to the lottery are specifically outside the remit of the official review. The changing face of gambling in Britain is exemplified by the launch today of a proposal by Blackpool Challenge Partnership to build six Las Vegas-style hotel casinos on Lancashire's faded golden mile. The \u00a31bn regeneration scheme will be backed by the tourism minister, Janet Anderson, but its promoters are gambling that the Home Office review recommends a fundamental relaxation of the law. It is expected to report in June, after the election. Blackpool's bid is modelled on Atlantic City in New Jersey, and the first of its mega-gaming hotels is scheduled to be Pharaoh's Palace, with pyramids, sphinxes and obelisks, to be built by 2006. Until recently, casino advertising was banned, and even now it is restricted to discreet ads in the classified columns of magazines and newspapers. The kind of mass billboard advertising used to promote Atlantic City and Las Vegas across the US is still banned. Also prohibited is staging live entertainment and providing alcoholic drinks at gaming tables. While American and European casinos boast row after row of one-armed bandits, only 10 slot machines are allowed in each British casino and only eight games are allowed, including blackjack, roulette, craps and poker. Ministers are believed to acknowledge that the current regulation is overbureaucratic and uncompetitive. Despite Gordon Brown's background as the \"son of the manse\", the chancellor's decision to scrap betting tax in his Budget is also expected to lead to a more liberal gambling environment. Any further relaxation of the laws is expected to be accompanied by an expansion in treatment facilities for problem gamblers, tough controls on under-age gambling and measures to keep the industry free from money laundering operations and infiltration by organised crime gangs. When the review was launched in December 1999, the junior Home Office minster, Mike O'Brien, said that in the 30 years since the current gambling laws came into effect social attitudes had changed, and the law was fast being overtaken by technological developments. Betting figures \u0095 Global gambling totals \u00a3986bn a year, \u00a37bn in UK \u0095 35m visited Las Vegas in 2000 (up from 21m in 1990); Atlantic City had 33m visitors \u0095 Nine of 10 largest hotels in world are in Vegas: The Bellagio, a \u00a31bn copy of Lake Como, has 36 floors, 3,025 rooms and 400 suites \u0095 In 1998, Americans spent more on gambling than on recorded music, theme parks, video games, spectator sports, and movie tickets combined \u0095 An estimated 5.3m Americans are gambling addicts, and 300,000 in UK \u0095 300,000 Britons a year visit Las Vegas, more than from any other country in Europe \u0095 1m work in gambling in US; average wage is $26,000 \u0095 There are 116 UK casinos; the 23 in London account for 70% of takings. Total \"drop\" (money exchanged for chips) in 1999-2000 was \u00a33.1bn. \u0095 72% of UK adults gambled in some way in 1999 Esther Addley",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The whole unpalatable saga of the internet twins, whose future has been decided in the high court today, has wider repercussions for adoption in this country.</p> <p>The case brought the issue of adoption into the nation's homes. Everyone had a view on whether or not Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the couple who paid an \u00a38,200 fee to adopt the children in the US, were fit to be parents. Lurid tabloid tales of their past behaviour, slovenly housekeeping and seeming need to court the media did much to undermine their case in the public mind.</p> <p>It raised the spectre of a market in children as people became aware that, whatever the facts in this particular case, there was a trade in infants over the net.</p> <p>\"It's immoral and should be illegal,\" said Michelle Elliott, director of Kidscape children's charity, summing up a national mood. \"The idea we can buy and sell babies to the highest bidder over the internet as if it is an auction cannot be in any child's interests.\"</p> <p>\"It's an appalling way of placing children; it's back to the bad old days where people paid under the table for babies. But I think there are enough unscrupulous people and enough desperate parents that it will always be there. People will find a way of doing this, so there has to be an emphasis on immigration and proper papers for the baby when they're brought in at Heathrow.</p> <p>However, Ms Elliott said that the internet is not to blame. \"It's a shame because the internet can be a force for good and can put you in touch with agencies that do have children's interests at heart. The point is: how do you regulate it?\"</p> <p>And the need for regulation has been plain for all to see. The appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show of the Kilshaws and their American rivals for \"ownership\" of the twins, Richard and Vickie Allen, made the whole affair seem more like a game show than a process to decide on the future of two tiny, vulnerable human beings.</p> <p>Since the case hit the headlines, \"the dangers of unregulated adoption services are more clearly painted and the intercountry aspects are seen as important\", points out Association of Directors of Social Services president Moira Gibb.</p> <p>Previously, if anyone had thought about overseas adoption at all, it might have been because of an occasional article in the press saying - rightly - how hard it is to adopt babies in this country. One that perhaps told a tale of unhelpful, ideologically driven social workers preventing willing and loving people from giving needy children in this country a home, and perhaps telling of a couple who were \"forced\" to go abroad.</p> <p>While there are almost certainly cases of potential adopters driven to distraction by bureaucracy and the adoption process isn't an easy ride, there's another side to the tale. \"There's been ill-informed media comment implying that people were driven to adopt [abroad] because of the negative views of social services to adoption,\" says Ms Gibb. \"The facts - about how many children are available, how long they wait and the shortage of adoptive parents - were only covered by a few.\"</p> <p>And the facts are that most children in this country who are adopted are older, may have physical, mental and behavioural difficulties and troubled pasts. More children are being adopted from care - but these are often not easy adoptions for either the children or the recipient families and social services have a duty to ensure the needs of the children being placed - not the adults wanting to adopt - are paramount.</p> <p>However, while adoption may have been topical, it's unlikely that the case will dramatically change the public perception of social services. Flintshire social services were lucky to get a metaphorical pat on the back rather than a slating when they took the twins, Belinda and Kimberley, away from the Kilshaws. Usually, images of social workers taking children into care provoke cries of know-it-all professionals breaking up families. But, in this case, the family had little, if any, public sympathy.</p> <p>But Ms Gibb doesn't think that'll change the stereotype of interfering social workers. They will still be \"damned if they do [intervene] and damned if they don't\", she says. \"The whole issue of intervening in family life is fraught with difficulties.

      "bodyText": "The whole unpalatable saga of the internet twins, whose future has been decided in the high court today, has wider repercussions for adoption in this country. The case brought the issue of adoption into the nation's homes. Everyone had a view on whether or not Alan and Judith Kilshaw, the couple who paid an \u00a38,200 fee to adopt the children in the US, were fit to be parents. Lurid tabloid tales of their past behaviour, slovenly housekeeping and seeming need to court the media did much to undermine their case in the public mind. It raised the spectre of a market in children as people became aware that, whatever the facts in this particular case, there was a trade in infants over the net. \"It's immoral and should be illegal,\" said Michelle Elliott, director of Kidscape children's charity, summing up a national mood. \"The idea we can buy and sell babies to the highest bidder over the internet as if it is an auction cannot be in any child's interests.\" \"It's an appalling way of placing children; it's back to the bad old days where people paid under the table for babies. But I think there are enough unscrupulous people and enough desperate parents that it will always be there. People will find a way of doing this, so there has to be an emphasis on immigration and proper papers for the baby when they're brought in at Heathrow. However, Ms Elliott said that the internet is not to blame. \"It's a shame because the internet can be a force for good and can put you in touch with agencies that do have children's interests at heart. The point is: how do you regulate it?\" And the need for regulation has been plain for all to see. The appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show of the Kilshaws and their American rivals for \"ownership\" of the twins, Richard and Vickie Allen, made the whole affair seem more like a game show than a process to decide on the future of two tiny, vulnerable human beings. Since the case hit the headlines, \"the dangers of unregulated adoption services are more clearly painted and the intercountry aspects are seen as important\", points out Association of Directors of Social Services president Moira Gibb. Previously, if anyone had thought about overseas adoption at all, it might have been because of an occasional article in the press saying - rightly - how hard it is to adopt babies in this country. One that perhaps told a tale of unhelpful, ideologically driven social workers preventing willing and loving people from giving needy children in this country a home, and perhaps telling of a couple who were \"forced\" to go abroad. While there are almost certainly cases of potential adopters driven to distraction by bureaucracy and the adoption process isn't an easy ride, there's another side to the tale. \"There's been ill-informed media comment implying that people were driven to adopt [abroad] because of the negative views of social services to adoption,\" says Ms Gibb. \"The facts - about how many children are available, how long they wait and the shortage of adoptive parents - were only covered by a few.\" And the facts are that most children in this country who are adopted are older, may have physical, mental and behavioural difficulties and troubled pasts. More children are being adopted from care - but these are often not easy adoptions for either the children or the recipient families and social services have a duty to ensure the needs of the children being placed - not the adults wanting to adopt - are paramount. However, while adoption may have been topical, it's unlikely that the case will dramatically change the public perception of social services. Flintshire social services were lucky to get a metaphorical pat on the back rather than a slating when they took the twins, Belinda and Kimberley, away from the Kilshaws. Usually, images of social workers taking children into care provoke cries of know-it-all professionals breaking up families. But, in this case, the family had little, if any, public sympathy. But Ms Gibb doesn't think that'll change the stereotype of interfering social workers. They will still be \"damned if they do [intervene] and damned if they don't\", she says. \"The whole issue of intervening in family life is fraught with difficulties. And, inevitably, the public don't have the full facts.\" The biggest effect has undoubtedly been on the law. Ministers were rattled. An adoption bill - which almost certainly would have had to take its place in the queue of post-election legislation - has been brought out, following an exchange in the House of Commons over the internet twins. While it focuses on matters at home, the bill constitutes the biggest overhaul of adoption law in 25 years. In terms of international adoption, the main effect has undoubtedly been to speed up the implementation of a recent law on adopting from overseas. Until the Kilshaws popped up in every tabloid on every TV screen, there was no timetable for implementing the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999. The act makes it unlawful for a UK resident to bring a child into the country in order to adopt them, unless a recognised agency (such as a local authority social services department) has carried out a full assessment of the prospective parents. But bringing the law into effect has become a political priority. From the end of this month, it'll be a criminal offence to bring in a child for the purposes of adoption without approval from a recognised adoption agency, punishable by fines of up to \u00a35,000, or a prison sentence of up to three months, or both. (As it happens, the Kilshaws probably wouldn't have fallen foul of this new piece of legislation, as they had obtained an interim adoption order within the US, which is currently recognised under UK law.) So, for months, the Kilshaws have been a source of fun (and worse). Today's reports of Mrs Kilshaw being led from the court, screaming abuse, will add to their notoriety. And the judge has decided that it would \"not be in the welfare interests of the twins for them to be returned to Mr and Mrs Kilshaw\". But, as they fade from public view, it seems the couple will have a surprising legacy. Their shocking and unsuccessful and attempt to add to their family has done children awaiting adoption a big favour.",

      "body": "<p>In 1804, aged 26 and just back from a tour of Greece and Asia Minor, the young Cambridge scholar William Wilkins was commissioned to refashion the Grange, a handsome late 17th-century Hampshire country house, in the latest Grecian mode. He performed his task admirably. Today, although largely abandoned and in a state of pleasing decay, the Grange remains a startling and wonderful sight: here, in a quiet English valley, is a rural acropolis, a touch of ancient Greece. </p> <p>The Grange is one of the finest neoclassical houses in Britain but, until recently, also one of the most forgotten. It is Wilkins's best work; his National Gallery on Trafalgar Square seems weak-kneed compared with this muscular design, set in some 650 acres of landscaped gardens and woods at Northington. </p> <p>The house emerged from long years of isolation in 1998 when it became the summer home of the newly founded and critically acclaimed Grange Park Opera. In the summer season, its noble Doric portico has been flanked by colourful Indian tents and resounded to the sounds of singers, orchestras and popping champagne corks. There are 20 indoor performances each summer, attended by some 8,000 people in total. </p> <p>Grange Park Opera is one of three rural English opera companies, the others being Glyndebourne (founded in 1934) and the younger Garsington Opera (1988), of which Wasfi Kani, founder of Grange Park Opera, was once chief executive. Now Kani wants to expand opera at the Grange and is seeking planning permission to install a subtle new auditorium tucked away at the back of Wilkins's masterpiece. </p> <p>The new works, designed by Studio E Architects, will cost \u00a32m. The horseshoe-shaped auditorium, sans fly-tower, will be sunk four metres into the ground, and seat 500. Its design is based on Wilkins's own horseshoe plan, which you can still see at the theatre he built at Bury St Edmunds. </p> <p>The idea is that the audience will sit on faded old velvet seats under six grandiose chandeliers where the theatre is now in the Picture Gallery. This was rebuilt in about 1890 from the Orangery designed by CR Cockerell (architect of the Graeco-Roman Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). </p> <p>In the new design, they will look through what is now the north wall of the gallery into a new building containing stage, wings and a new orchestra pit. This will be contemporary in style, but hidden demurely behind a re-creation of a wing designed by Robert Smirke (of British Museum fame) in 1817 but later demolished. The wing will be used for storing scenery as well as providing a passage for performers, who change in the basements of the main house. </p> <p>From a strictly architectural perspective, the wing will pull the composition of the Grange together: at the moment the Picture Gallery is detached from the main body of the house, which has never seemed right. </p> <p>The interior of the Grange is all but empty, decoration and detail stripped away over the years. During the summer, opera-goers picnic on the lawns or in the grand, empty rooms of this curious monument to the architectural fashions of a well-travelled and flamboyant Regency. </p> <p>One of the best things about this project is that neither the opera chaps nor the architects want to undermine the Grange's magical, gently haunting quality by making the new works too swish and smart. </p> <p>The new auditorium will be romantic and just a bit wobbly - not structurally, of course, but aesthetically. As for the new stage-wings/orchestra-pit extension, this will be clad in soft brick and green timber, merging into the fabric of the Grange like moss does with old brick. </p> <p>The happily low-key project will let the Grange come back to life as slowly as it faded from the 1930s. The opera company has been granted a lease until 2018 by present owner Lord Ashburton (John Baring). The idea is not to be too ambitious (who now remembers the loudly trumpeted scheme to build a rural opera house at Compton Verney?) but to let opera take root, if not naturally - there's nothing natural about opera - then aria by aria, act by act. </p> <p>This seems appropriate because the history of this extraordinary house is as complex as the libretto of an 18th-century Italian opera. It changed its glamorous disguises with impunity in its first 250 years. Built between 1664 and 1673, it started life as the red-brick and Portland stone country seat of Sir Robert Henley, Lord Chancellor and 1st Earl of Northington. He sold it to the Drummond banking family in 1787; it was then leased from time to time to George IV's \"sisters\" (hemhem) and sold it on to Alexander Baring shortly after its Grecian transfiguration. </p> <p>Changes came thick and fast during the 19th century. In 1933 it was sold to the millionaire industrialist Charles Wallach, who made his fortune selling medicinal paraffin to Edwardian ladies with dicky tummies. He lived in a solitary wing after the second world war, by which time the house had been knocked about a bit by US soldiers billeted here. No one has lived in the house since Wallach's death in 1964. </p> <p>John Baring bought The Grange soon after and various ruined bits were demolished. In 1975 he brought in English Heritage as the Grange's guardian and the house was made watertight. This summer it will echo to the sound of Cosi Fan Tutte, I Capuleti e I Montecchi and Fortunio, but probably not too many sheep, which always enhance the look of English country houses. </p> <p>David Lloyd Jones, speaking for Studio E Architects, describes the Grange plans as \"bespoke reversible building\". This is a nice conceit; what it means is that, at no vast cost, when the lease runs out and if no one wishes to renew it, the new works can be taken down and the house left to fall back into its long postwar after-dinner sleep. </p> <p>But for now - if Wasfi Kani raises the money and English Heritage approves - the Grange will have been brought out of the land of neglect and into the nymphs-and-shepherds Arcadia it was meant to represent. This summer, foot and mouth permitting, go and see, and even hear - if you can afford a seat - this great survivor for yourself. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Grange Park Opera's summer season starts on June 14 with Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte.

Mike Scott, wild-eyed shaman and dreamer \u0096 all right, hippy \u0096 slept out much of the 90s with under-publicised solo efforts, but he has returned to splendidly over-egg his massive musical pudding. His latest LP, My Love Is A Rock In The Weary Land, is apparently a response to London, how he responds to Maidstone, meanwhile, may be more emotive still. Soul Caf\u00e9, 110 Week Street, Maidstone (01622-751415) 7.30pm, \u00a317.50. Pop Monday: Muse With Muse, it's not so much a question of \"sing when you're winning\" as \"squeal in an alarmingly high voice when you're winning\". And winning, the west-country three-piece undoubtedly are. Their records remain daft, but live, evidently, this is their domain. University Of East Anglia, Earlham Road, Norwich (01603-508050) 7.30pm, \u00a310.50. Tuesday: Dido Carefully synchronised with the release of Eminem's Stan, Dido has risen on the back of something very interesting indeed, with something not especially interesting at all. Her music's a lightly folky, mildly clubby sort of thing \u0096 if that's your dinner party, rave on. The Academy, Dale End, Birmingham (0870-903 2222) 7.30pm, \u00a312. Wednesday: Shed 7 Shed 7 are the underdogs who roll on, but will not roll over. Genuine adversity has recently befallen them: being dropped by their record company, the departure of their lead guitarist, and the use of one of their songs on an advert for Link mobile phone warehouse, but to them this is all in the job description. Dorking Halls, Reigate Road, Dorking (01306-881717) 8pm, \u00a312-\u00a314. Thursday: Autechre Autechre's music is highly structured, disciplined and difficult, constructed on intellectual lines much more than hedonistic ones. Still, harsh sounds for scratched chins and egg heads. New Trinity Centre, Trinity Road, St Phillips, Bristol (0117-9299008), 8pm, \u00a311. John Robinson Classical Monday: Il Trovatore It's a bit like that television programme where the director of ICI has to go and mix paints for a week: Anthony Payne, general director of English National Opera, has abandoned his office for the daunting task of staging a new production of Verdi's Il Trovatore. Payne appears to relish this rare chance of working at \"the coal face of production\". London Coliseum, St Martin\u0092s Lane, London WC2 (020-7632 8300) 7.30pm, \u00a33-\u00a352.50. Tuesday: Tear And Lill Not a new comedy duo but a joint recital by two of our most distinguished musicians, tenor Robert Tear and pianist John Lill, including songs by Britten and the Appassionata Sonata. The Concert Hall, Blagrave St, Reading (0118-960 6060) 7.30pm, \u00a314.50 &amp; \u00a316.50. Thursday: Passion Time Last year the 250th anniversary of Bach's death prompted many choirs and orchestras to step up their performances of choral masterpieces such as the Passions. This year there are if anything even more Passions to choose from in Holy Week. Here the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra shows true dedication (and considerable stamina) by offering two consecutive performances of the St Matthew, the second on Good Friday. Sakari Oramo conducts this great masterpiece with soloists that include Rufus Muller as the Evangelist and Paul Whelan as Christus. Symphony Hall, Broad Street, Birmingham (0121-780 3333) 7pm, \u00a36-\u00a332.50. County Youth First of two youth orchestra concerts at the Wiltshire Music Centre: tonight the Wiltshire and Swindon Youth Orchestra play Delius, de Falla, and Sibelius, followed on Saturday by the Somerset County Youth Orchestra with a programme that includes Elgar's Enigma Variations. Wiltshire Music Centre, Ashley Road, Bradford-on-Avon (01225-860100) 7.30pm, \u00a38, concs \u00a36. Christopher Lambton Theatre Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings And A Funeral Bollywood comes to the stage with Tamasha's delightful musical featuring romance, comedy, melodrama, tears and song. It is impossible not to enjoy yourself at this heartfelt, witty and imaginative evening. Birmingham Rep, Broad Street, Birmingham (0121-236 4455) Tue-Fri 7.30pm, Sat 4pm, 8pm, Thurs mat 2.30pm, \u00a35-\u00a316. Coriolanus Will it be a hat trick for the Tobacco Factory whose productions of Lear and Measure For Measure have been models of clear, simple storytelling that brings Shakespeare alive? It is almost a sure thing that Andrew Hilton will pull it off with this tale of a soldier at war with himself. The Tobacco Factory, Raleigh Road, Bedminster, Bristol (0117-902 0344) 7.30pm, Sat mat 2.30pm, \u00a39-\u00a315. The Lieutenant Of Inishmore Who knocked \"Mad Padraig's\" cat over on a lonely road and was it an accident? The RSC don their Irish accents to premiere the latest slice of Irish life seen through the satirical eye of Martin McDonagh. The Other Place, Waterside, Stratford Upon Avon (01789-403403) Wed-Sat 7.30pm, Sat mat 1.30pm, \u00a310. Amy's View Art, theatre and politics are the subjects of David Hare's 1997 success.Susannah York plays Esme, a painter's widow and successful actress who in the course of the play loses everything but her talent. The play sets up a debate by pitting Esme against a former theatre critic and media hustler. New Theatre, Park Place, Cardiff (029-2087 8889) Tue-Sat 7.30pm, Thurs and Sat mat 3pm, \u00a37-\u00a319.

The government also faced criticism from the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who attacked what he called the continuing failure of the British authorities to disinfect vehicles bound for Ireland from British ports.</p> <p>He announced a plan to have Irish workers do the job, as efforts continue to keep foot and mouth restricted to one isolated outbreak.</p> <p>Mr Brown said in his letter that although there were signs that the culling policy was starting to \"bite\", there was no room for complacency.</p> <p>Figures from the last 10 days show that the exponential growth originally feared by scientists had not materialised.</p> <p>But the minister said the virulent nature of the disease meant it was too early for the authorities to drop their guard.</p> <p>Over a million animals will have been slaughtered by the time the disease is eradicated and compensation to farmers is likely to total \u00a3200m, Mr Brown said yesterday.</p> <p>The number of confirmed cases had risen to 1,126 by last night.</p> <p>Members of the Chinese community protested yesterday over the allegation that a Chinese restaurant was responsible for importing foot and mouth.</p> <p>Around 500 demonstrators marched from Gerrard Street in the heart of London's Chinatown through Whitehall to the Ministry of Agriculture, waving placards and chanting \"Mr Blair - Be Fair\" and \"Justice for the Chinese\".

      "bodyText": "The first signs that the foot and mouth crisis is beginning to recede emerged at the weekend as the numbers of new cases dropped. Outbreaks are being contained at between 20 and 25 a day, compared with between 40 and 45 a day early last week. The government has urged caution, saying that scientists will need to analyse the figures over seven days before a trend can be confirmed. There is still a backlog of animals waiting to be slaughtered, and it was confirmed at the weekend that the virus has made its biggest unexplained jump since the crisis began. An outbreak was confirmed at Ashes Farm at Ruswarp, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, 40 miles from the nearest case. The Ministry of Agriculture is investigating whether a vehicle travelling from Cumbria to Whitby was responsible for the spread. Meanwhile, the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, urged livestock farmers not to undermine the government's strategy by appealing against the culling of their animals. Mr Brown wrote to all 85,000 livestock farmers in England urging them to appeal against culling only in \"very exceptional circumstances\". Farmers had been exercising their right to appeal as a matter of routine, officials said. It is considered vital to slaughter animals on neighbouring farms within 48 hours if the disease is to be controlled and eradicated. The government also faced criticism from the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who attacked what he called the continuing failure of the British authorities to disinfect vehicles bound for Ireland from British ports. He announced a plan to have Irish workers do the job, as efforts continue to keep foot and mouth restricted to one isolated outbreak. Mr Brown said in his letter that although there were signs that the culling policy was starting to \"bite\", there was no room for complacency. Figures from the last 10 days show that the exponential growth originally feared by scientists had not materialised. But the minister said the virulent nature of the disease meant it was too early for the authorities to drop their guard. Over a million animals will have been slaughtered by the time the disease is eradicated and compensation to farmers is likely to total \u00a3200m, Mr Brown said yesterday. The number of confirmed cases had risen to 1,126 by last night. Members of the Chinese community protested yesterday over the allegation that a Chinese restaurant was responsible for importing foot and mouth. Around 500 demonstrators marched from Gerrard Street in the heart of London's Chinatown through Whitehall to the Ministry of Agriculture, waving placards and chanting \"Mr Blair - Be Fair\" and \"Justice for the Chinese\". Chinese restaurants closed for two hours as owners showed their anger at being blamed for the crisis. After meeting members of the Chinese civil rights action group, the agriculture minister said: \"One issue of particular concern to them was the impression given in some sections of the media that investigations into the source of the current foot and mouth outbreak have positively demonstrated that the initial infection came from waste from a Chinese restaurant. \"This is untrue.

Typically the search for missing servicemen begins with military historians asking Vietnamese villagers for information about where battles took place and the location of planes that were shot down.

      "body": "<p>Crown prosecutors are reconsidering bringing corporate manslaughter charges against senior managers of Railtrack and Thames Trains in connection with the Paddington rail crash, sources close to the criminal inquiry revealed last night.</p> <p>The grounds are that Railtrack was well aware of the dangers of signal 109, where the accident occurred, but did little to address them. The driver of a Thames train leaving Paddington passed through signal 109 at red, directly into the path of a high-speed train approaching Paddington from Cheltenham.</p> <p>In the resulting accident 31 people were killed and more than 400 injured.</p> <p>At the public inquiry, chaired by Lord Cullen, evidence was produced that the driver's view of the signal might have been impaired by its position and bright sunlight.</p> <p>Thames Trains could be charged with failing to give its drivers proper training: evidence was also given at the inquiry that some drivers were not fully aware of the train paths into Paddington, one of the busiest mainline stations in Britain.</p> <p>The CPS said yesterday that no charges were imminent. But the British transport police are re-examining the evidence to see whether charges of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence can be laid.</p> <p>In the period leading up to the accident, Railtrack convened several meetings with health and safety officials and the unions to discuss the potential dangers of signal 109, but no action was taken. The signal was taken out of commission immediately after the crash, in spite of legal protests by Railtrack, and has not been restored.</p> <p>Widespread alterations were made to the approach to Paddington station, including the signalling and tracks, to accommodate the introduction of the Heathrow Express service from the airport to Paddington three years ago. Speed restrictions into Paddington imposed after the crash are still in place.</p> <p>Relatives of the dead have been pressing for corporate manslaughter charges to be brought against Railtrack and Thames ever since the accident in October 1999. They have become increasingly concerned about the delay, and are anxiously waiting for Lord Cullen's report, to be published in the summer.</p> <p>Although it will almost certainly criticise Railtrack and Thames, evidence given at a public inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings. The police therefore have to make their own inquiries before deciding whether to go ahead with a prosecution.</p> <p>The position would be easier for them if the legislation being considered by the Home Office to introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter was on the statute books.</p> <p>If manslaughter charges are not brought, individual managers of Railtrack and Thames Trains are likely to be charged under the Health and Safety at Work Act. This happened after the Southall rail crash in 1997, when Great Western Trains was fined \u00a31.5m for running a Swansea-to-London high-speed train in the knowledge that safety equipment in the driver's cab was not operating. In December the health and safety executive concluded that signals in the area of the Paddington crash were \"exceptionally difficult\" to read and did not comply with industry standards. Many were too high, making them particularly difficult to read when the sun was low in the sky.</p> <p>Signal 109 had been passed at danger seven other times in five years, and was among the 22 most dangerous signals on the railway network, it found.</p> <p>In the six months before Paddington there were 109 serious incidents of signals being passed at danger. The incidence fell after Paddington, but the HSE reported last month that it had risen again to approximately the level of the mid-90s.</p>",

At the public inquiry, chaired by Lord Cullen, evidence was produced that the driver's view of the signal might have been impaired by its position and bright sunlight. Thames Trains could be charged with failing to give its drivers proper training: evidence was also given at the inquiry that some drivers were not fully aware of the train paths into Paddington, one of the busiest mainline stations in Britain. The CPS said yesterday that no charges were imminent. But the British transport police are re-examining the evidence to see whether charges of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence can be laid. In the period leading up to the accident, Railtrack convened several meetings with health and safety officials and the unions to discuss the potential dangers of signal 109, but no action was taken. The signal was taken out of commission immediately after the crash, in spite of legal protests by Railtrack, and has not been restored. Widespread alterations were made to the approach to Paddington station, including the signalling and tracks, to accommodate the introduction of the Heathrow Express service from the airport to Paddington three years ago. Speed restrictions into Paddington imposed after the crash are still in place. Relatives of the dead have been pressing for corporate manslaughter charges to be brought against Railtrack and Thames ever since the accident in October 1999. They have become increasingly concerned about the delay, and are anxiously waiting for Lord Cullen's report, to be published in the summer. Although it will almost certainly criticise Railtrack and Thames, evidence given at a public inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings. The police therefore have to make their own inquiries before deciding whether to go ahead with a prosecution. The position would be easier for them if the legislation being considered by the Home Office to introduce an offence of corporate manslaughter was on the statute books. If manslaughter charges are not brought, individual managers of Railtrack and Thames Trains are likely to be charged under the Health and Safety at Work Act. This happened after the Southall rail crash in 1997, when Great Western Trains was fined \u00a31.5m for running a Swansea-to-London high-speed train in the knowledge that safety equipment in the driver's cab was not operating. In December the health and safety executive concluded that signals in the area of the Paddington crash were \"exceptionally difficult\" to read and did not comply with industry standards. Many were too high, making them particularly difficult to read when the sun was low in the sky. Signal 109 had been passed at danger seven other times in five years, and was among the 22 most dangerous signals on the railway network, it found. In the six months before Paddington there were 109 serious incidents of signals being passed at danger. The incidence fell after Paddington, but the HSE reported last month that it had risen again to approximately the level of the mid-90s.",

      "bodyText": "Spain's Roman Catholic church is about to take the unprecedented step of excommunicating members of the armed Basque separatist group Eta, senior church figures told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo yesterday. The head of the Spanish Bishops' Council, Cardinal Antonio Rouco Varela, has called a special meeting of the country's 85 most important archbishops and bishops to set in motion the excommunication process in two weeks' time. The planned excommunication of Eta and its gunmen was reported to have the explicit backing of the pope and the Vatican hierarchy. Excommunication, usually reserved for heretics, has not been used in Spain since 1951, when it was applied to a popular soothsayer in Seville. In recent years the Roman Catholic church in Latin America has used it against drug cartels and the kidnappers of the entire congregation of a church in Colombia and against kidnapping gangs and torturers in Mexico. \"There is no doubt about the legality of applying excommunication as terrorism is clearly an offence against life and liberty,\" argued one Spanish archbishop, Jose Manuel Estepa. \"We need to atone for the scandal provoked by the fact that it appears that quite a few Eta members have come from the ecclesiastical community.\" Excommunication would be a powerful tool in the propaganda battle against Eta as Basques are the most intensely religious people in Spain - with 40% still attending Mass at least once a week. The Jesuits are particularly strong, with the order's founder, Saint Ignatius, hailing from the Basque hill town of Loyola. Eta itself was founded in the 1960s by a group of people who were close to the church and, in many cases, had been to Jesuit seminaries or schools. Some Eta members are still fervent Catholics. At least one priest, Father Jose Ramon Trebino, has been jailed for giving refuge to separatist gunmen on the run from the law. Other members of the Basque clergy are believed to support Eta's separatist aims. Inaki Esnaola, a leader of Herri Batasuna, the party allied to Eta, is a former priest. The Basque language, Euskara, was kept alive by local priests when it was banned during the Franco dictatorship. In practical terms the decision would make little difference to religious life in the Basque country, but it would mean that funerals of Eta members could no longer be held in their local churches. The bishops' debate on excommunication will come just three weeks before Basques go to the polls for regional elections on May 13.",

Versace, whose sometimes garish creations opened up the wallets of film stars, pop icons and royalty across the world, was an avid collector. Yesterday the organisers of a three-day sale in New York of 600 items from the designers Miami home, Casa Casuarina, were celebrating the windfall. Among the beneficiaries of the sale will be a charity promoting gun safety and a fashion scholarship. Versace's collection went back to the 16th century and trod a thin line between gaudy and baroque.

      "body": "<p>As George Bush and his friends in the Texas oil industry try to turn the clock back on commitments the United States has made on fighting global warming, a new report by America's leading scientists confirms the serious effects of climate change on the world's most prosperous and polluting nation. </p> <p>Three hundred of the most illustrious names in US science were consulted before the National Science and Technology Council produced the report, published this week, reviewing the costs and benefits to America. A copy is being sent to every senator and congressman so that they can see the effect on their voters. </p> <p>In the wake of the report it will be increasingly difficult to claim, as Mr Bush has in the last few weeks, that the science of climate change is still unproved. Instead the scientists hope the debate will move on to what actions need to be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change which the report says will happen whatever what the administration decides to do. </p> <p>The general picture painted in the report is of a country with a tradition of wilderness and wide open spaces placing its natural heritage under increasing pressure. The spectre of the Great Lakes beginning to dry out, trout and salmon disappearing as rivers warm and alpine meadows and snow fields under threat is balanced by greater agricultural productivity in the warmer north and increased tree growth. </p> <p><strong> Coastal threats</strong><br> </p> <p> But it is the 95,000 miles of coastline and the 3.4m sq miles of ocean inside US territorial waters where the news is most alarming. Corals are already dying because of the heat, damaging the tourist industry, wetlands needed for fish breeding are disappearing, and the 53% of the US population that live in the coastal zone are threatened by sea level rise. </p> <p>The best estimate is that sea levels will rise by 48cm (19in) this century but it could be as much as 95cm (37in). Coastal land levels are falling because of the way silt from floods is prevented from reaching the coast by river management. </p> <p>The report will make daunting reading in particular for Florida, the state whose controversial voting system put Mr Bush in the White House. \"Atlantic and Gulf coast shorelines are especially vulnerable to long term sea level rise as well as an increase in the frequency of storm surges or hurricanes,\" the authors say. </p> <p>Most erosion is caused suddenly during storms. The slope of areas like Florida is so gentle that a small rise in sea level produces a large inland shift of the shoreline. </p> <p>\"When buildings, roads, sea walls block this natural shift, the beaches and shorelines erode, especially during storm events. Coastal towns and cities, especially those in storm-prone regions such as the south-east, are particularly vulnerable to extreme events. Intensive residential and commercial development in such regions put life and property at risk.\" </p> <p>Other heavily populated regions away from the coasts also have bad news. The extra heat trapped and retained by cities, particularly at night, make many old, ill and poor people vulnerable to heatstroke and related illnesses. Insect- and rodent-borne diseases are expected to become more widespread. Air pollution which also kills is noticeably worse in hot spells. </p> <p>The report is being published on Friday in a week when Mr Bush will come under increasing diplomatic and domestic pressure to change course on climate. Having rejected carbon dioxide curbs on electricity producers his policy increasingly leans towards helping Texas oil interests. </p> <p>The New York Times revealed at the weekend that an energy task force headed by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, was intending to open up millions of acres of public land to new oil and gas exploration. Along with the already controversial Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska, which has been flagged up by Mr Bush as a target, Mr Cheney has earmarked other sensitive areas. </p> <p>These include large protected areas of the Rockies, parts of the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana and the Jack Morrow Hills in Wyoming. Another 17m acres of federal land in 11 western states under temporary protection from energy development would be removed. There is 137 trillion cubic feet of gas, mostly under the Rockies, enough to supply the US for six years. </p> <p>\"Natural ecosystems, which are our life support system in many important ways, appear to be the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of climate change,\" the report says. </p> <p>As well as predictable outcomes of climate change there will be surprises. Alterations in ocean circulation, cloud distribution, or storms could bring prolonged spells of completely different weather wrecking normal agriculture. </p> <p>The assessment is based on greenhouse gas emissions continuing on present trends. But even with reductions brought about by international agreements the the US and the rest of the planet are certain to experience more than a century of climate change, owing to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere and the momentum of the climate system. </p> <p>Internationally, the EU, Japan and Russia, the three largest parties to the Climate Change Convention, look increasingly likely to gang up on Mr Bush. The Kyoto protocol, which Mr Bush has repudiated, could still come into legal force without the US if these countries cooperate. If developed countries with 55% of global emissions of greenhouse gases in 1990 all ratified the treaty it should come into binding effect, but without the US. The EU, Russia and Japan all said last week that this was their intention. </p> <p>If the plan works, the effect on climate change would not be great. However, US industrial giants are likely to be unhappy about being cut out of worldwide carbon trading and billion dollar export markets transferring clean technologies to developing countries.</p>",

A copy is being sent to every senator and congressman so that they can see the effect on their voters. In the wake of the report it will be increasingly difficult to claim, as Mr Bush has in the last few weeks, that the science of climate change is still unproved. Instead the scientists hope the debate will move on to what actions need to be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change which the report says will happen whatever what the administration decides to do. The general picture painted in the report is of a country with a tradition of wilderness and wide open spaces placing its natural heritage under increasing pressure. The spectre of the Great Lakes beginning to dry out, trout and salmon disappearing as rivers warm and alpine meadows and snow fields under threat is balanced by greater agricultural productivity in the warmer north and increased tree growth. Coastal threats But it is the 95,000 miles of coastline and the 3.4m sq miles of ocean inside US territorial waters where the news is most alarming. Corals are already dying because of the heat, damaging the tourist industry, wetlands needed for fish breeding are disappearing, and the 53% of the US population that live in the coastal zone are threatened by sea level rise. The best estimate is that sea levels will rise by 48cm (19in) this century but it could be as much as 95cm (37in). Coastal land levels are falling because of the way silt from floods is prevented from reaching the coast by river management. The report will make daunting reading in particular for Florida, the state whose controversial voting system put Mr Bush in the White House. \"Atlantic and Gulf coast shorelines are especially vulnerable to long term sea level rise as well as an increase in the frequency of storm surges or hurricanes,\" the authors say. Most erosion is caused suddenly during storms. The slope of areas like Florida is so gentle that a small rise in sea level produces a large inland shift of the shoreline. \"When buildings, roads, sea walls block this natural shift, the beaches and shorelines erode, especially during storm events. Coastal towns and cities, especially those in storm-prone regions such as the south-east, are particularly vulnerable to extreme events. Intensive residential and commercial development in such regions put life and property at risk.\" Other heavily populated regions away from the coasts also have bad news. The extra heat trapped and retained by cities, particularly at night, make many old, ill and poor people vulnerable to heatstroke and related illnesses. Insect- and rodent-borne diseases are expected to become more widespread. Air pollution which also kills is noticeably worse in hot spells. The report is being published on Friday in a week when Mr Bush will come under increasing diplomatic and domestic pressure to change course on climate. Having rejected carbon dioxide curbs on electricity producers his policy increasingly leans towards helping Texas oil interests. The New York Times revealed at the weekend that an energy task force headed by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, was intending to open up millions of acres of public land to new oil and gas exploration. Along with the already controversial Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska, which has been flagged up by Mr Bush as a target, Mr Cheney has earmarked other sensitive areas. These include large protected areas of the Rockies, parts of the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana and the Jack Morrow Hills in Wyoming. Another 17m acres of federal land in 11 western states under temporary protection from energy development would be removed. There is 137 trillion cubic feet of gas, mostly under the Rockies, enough to supply the US for six years. \"Natural ecosystems, which are our life support system in many important ways, appear to be the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of climate change,\" the report says. As well as predictable outcomes of climate change there will be surprises. Alterations in ocean circulation, cloud distribution, or storms could bring prolonged spells of completely different weather wrecking normal agriculture. The assessment is based on greenhouse gas emissions continuing on present trends. But even with reductions brought about by international agreements the the US and the rest of the planet are certain to experience more than a century of climate change, owing to the long lifetimes of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere and the momentum of the climate system. Internationally, the EU, Japan and Russia, the three largest parties to the Climate Change Convention, look increasingly likely to gang up on Mr Bush. The Kyoto protocol, which Mr Bush has repudiated, could still come into legal force without the US if these countries cooperate. If developed countries with 55% of global emissions of greenhouse gases in 1990 all ratified the treaty it should come into binding effect, but without the US. The EU, Russia and Japan all said last week that this was their intention. If the plan works, the effect on climate change would not be great. However, US industrial giants are likely to be unhappy about being cut out of worldwide carbon trading and billion dollar export markets transferring clean technologies to developing countries.",

The admission came after weeks of controversy about how two Mercedes cars bought by the firm, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, came to be registered in the names of the ruling African National Congress's parliamentary chief whip, Tony Yengeni, and his wife. Thabo Mbeki's government is facing accusations of covering up graft in the awarding of contracts for a highly controversial and unpopular arms deal worth 43bn rand (\u00a34bn). Critics have asked why a na tion with many people sorely in need of better housing and medical services is using such a sum on arms. Last week, the head of one of three government agencies investigating, said prosecutions are likely in the biggest corruption scandal in South Africa since apartheid ended. The European consortium, EADS - owned by DaimlerChrysler and the arms companies Aerospatiale Matra of France and Casa of Spain - admitted in a statement to Sunday newspapers in Johannesburg that it had \"rendered assistance\" to about 30 officials to get luxury vehicles. DaimlerChrysler also owns Mercedes-Benz. \"The sectors concerned were the civil airlines, defence, electronic industries, diplomatic and political officials,\" it said.

In February this year, Mr Yengeni, as chief whip, ordered ANC MPs on a watchdog committee to reject proposals for the country's leading anti-corruption investigator, Judge Willem Heath, to scrutinise the arms deal. Among voters and MPs many wanted the judge to look into the matter after South Africa's auditor general said there may have been kick backs and nepotism in the awarding of contracts. Mr Yengeni told parliament last week he did no wrong: \"The acquisition of the vehicle did not in any way whatsoever influence the award, or is related with the award of any contract in the arms procurement\" under investigation.

      "body": "<p>A fresh easterly is the best harvesting wind. It is a bitter blow that chews the face, harries the waves high on to the beach, and tortures the anchored container ships awaiting entrance to Teesport. But it is also the wind that brings in the coal shoals of the North Sea to Hartlepool.</p> <p>No one knows where the seams lie exactly, but every tide lifts its load from the seabed and drags it landward, tumbling and turning through itself like a shoal of black sprat. \"We've been here as long as the gulls,\" Steve Wilkins says as he digs.</p> <p>Seacoaling is a hard way to make a living. Dumped twice a day by the tides on to one of Hartlepool's many beaches, seacoal is fine-grained as congealing tar. A handful of it glitters slightly, and sifts pleasurably through the fingers. But mixed with acrid salt water, sand and other marine particles, it quickly loses any aesthetic qualities. It is heavy, and must be scraped up and loaded on to the specially constructed hold of a Land Rover by means only of a rake and shovel. And a constantly bending back.</p> <p>One load is two tons. On a good day a seacoaler might collect four or five loads from a single tide. Steve once gleaned 18. That's 36 tons with a rake and a shovel. It was the best day he can remember. And the hardest.</p> <p>No day is the same for the seacoalers. They work the tides, and consequently find themselves heading for the foreshore at any and every hour of the 24. Seven days a week. Theirs is the rota of the moon.</p> <p>In all there are about 11 owners of these ex-army surplus Land Rovers. Each with their sidelad. Arriving at the turn of the tide, the seacoalers first locate the coal, then as the tide ebbs they rake it up into long furrows or molehill heaps, depending on the lie of it, and finally load up as the tide waxes again. To be able to do this, day and night, each seacoaler has had to learn to speak the language of the sea as fluently as any fisherman.</p> <p>There are only two of them working the beach tonight. Steve, who owns the vehicle, and his sidelad, Mick. They work in perfect harmony, as smoothly and efficiently as an elegantly constructed piece of machinery. A massive flask of tea squats close by in the sand, vainly waiting for one of the few breaks. There is little chat. Working with the fluxes of the sea, time is of the essence.</p> <p>They are heirs to a long tradition. During the great Northumbrian civilisation of the seventh century, the monks of Blackhall Rocks, just north of Hartlepool, heated their cavernous cells with what they gathered from the tide. Until recently many people in Hartlepool fed their fires with the black crop of the sea. Indeed the figure wheeling a bicycle up from the beach with four bags of seacoal balanced on handle-and crossbars is still common.</p> <p>But the tradition is under threat. A vocal minority, apparently goaded on by a local newspaper, the Hartlepool Mail, are waging a vigorous campaign against the seacoalers. They are concerned about the dangers to pedestrians; an off-the-lead dog has recently been killed under the wheels of a cumbersome Land Rover. Protesters also cite the disturbance from seacoaling vehicles driving through built-up areas to their depots.</p> <p>Having loaded up, Steve now begins the hazardous journey to the depot by driving into the sea. Like soil disturbed by a ploughshare, the water foams from his wheels. One by one Hartlepool borough council is blocking vehicular access to the foreshores, and tonight, since he is working the northern limit of Seaton Carew beach, Steve must round the tip of a sewage pipe. \"See that bonnet?\" he asks, indicating the nose of the Land Rover which is pointing to where the lonely lights of the container ships can be seen twinkling in the open sea. \"When I can see the water on there, then I start to worry.\"</p> <p>Heavily burdened, the Land Rover sinks slightly in the soft sand at the lip of the pipe. A 20ft wave is towering in. Steve eyes it. It breaks. A weird sensation of weightlessness in the cab of this heavy vehicle is followed by the welcome hasp of wheels on denser sand. \"The thing is,\" he smiles. \"I trust my judgment.\"</p> <p>The slow, bouncy track through boulders and rocks up the seabank must be improvised anew with each tide. It is no surprise, given this and the corrosive salt of the sea, that seacoalers must change their Land Rovers once a year.</p> <p>The depot, at which seacoalers are paid by the ton, is closed at this hour, but Steve has a key. Having crossed the small weighbridge, he adds our load to the heap, and quickly turns round. Inexorably the sea is coming in towards the pipe. There will only be one more load tonight. In our absence Steve's son has arrived. One look at his face, and the way he grafts, is to know him as his father's son. Already he has half-filled his own Land Rover. \"Where we live,\" Steve explains, pausing in his shovelling only to glance at his son, \"there's heroin and that. I'm lucky with this young 'un. He knows how to work.\" Later he adds thoughtfully. \"Say if he asks me for money? I point at the Land Rover on the drive. He knows where the beach is.\"</p> <p>In the imagination of some local people, the seacoaler stands with a shovel raised threateningly over his thread and a volley of abuse on his tongue. To some they represent the archetypal roughneck, the shadowy, lazy, even dangerous figure at the margins of the labour market. Fights between different gangs of seacoalers loom large in Hartlepool folklore. \"They think we're scum,\" Steve says as he works. \"Call us the raggy lads, they do. Anything bad happens in the town, then it must have been us.\"</p> <p>This image contrasts with the truth. To seacoal, above all, is to know work. Steve gets home tonight at 11. He must be back at the beach for seven tomorrow morning. Anyone who is remotely lazy, overtly rowdy or too fond of a pint would not last two days working the tide.</p> <p>But not only that. There is a generosity of the spirit. Within 10 minutes of meeting us, Steve had taken the front door key from his fob. \"Stop with us,\" he had offered.</p> <p>The depot is open in time for the first load of the next morning. Even in the light of day this place is black; seacoal permeates everything. As Steve takes us to meet the owner of the depot, John Kirby, his foots sinks up to the ankle. Behind towering slabs of corrugated iron, topped with barbed wire, the machinery for separating sand from coal crouches amongst the heaps, gaunt and rusty like the ghost of a gallows. An image straight from the early years of the industrial revolution.</p> <p>As John shows us round the place, a skylark rises in song from behind one of the heaps. \"They won't win,\" John says with similar soaring energy. \"We'll fight until the end.\"</p> <p>With only a shovel to his name, John's father, Ken, began on the beach just after the war. Seizing one of the few opportunities for the Hartlepudlian entrepreneur, he quickly secured a vehicle for himself, a large eight-ton ex-army truck, then a second, before finally graduating to ownership of a depot. There are six or seven well-known millionaires in Hartlepool who made their start toiling in the bitter easterlies. A tradition of enterprise continued by John, who often loans the money for those seeking to buy their first Land Rover, the beach and its people being a no-go area for banks and other credit agencies.</p> <p>In the heady days of the 60s and 70s, when the local power stations took far larger orders than they do now, Hartlepool Council was forced to issue licences, bestowing its blessing on the enterprise, but before, and since then, the real story has been one of obstacles.</p> <p>Individual seacoalers have frequently found themselves in court for theft, but they have always been acquitted. This is because the Flotsam and Jetsam Act decrees that the booty of the sea is free for all. Seacoaling is the expression of a common right. A fact that the Hartlepool Mail greets with such headlines as: \"Thieves will not be prosecuted.\"</p> <p>All that the council can do now is to block access, which is what they are doing as they gradually redevelop the coastline. On one occasion they laid huge boulders at a strategic point, but some time in the night, when only seacoalers are about, digging machinery ramped the immense blockage with sand. This isn't an example of the perceived anarchy that so enrages the protesters. \"Whoever did that,\" says John with a twinkle in his eye, \"knows that a right of way must be vigorously defended.\"</p> <p>However, the sword of Damocles still hangs. The council are currently waiting for a grant from Maff to develop Seaton Carew front. Plans show that this would finish John and the 40 or 50 people whose jobs are connected with trade.</p> <p>Perhaps this is a way of life dissonant with the image the council wants for the borough, with its new marina and other so-called prestige developments, but in a place where secure jobs and the dignity and stability of family life that go with them are as rare as a skylark above a coal heap, John literally holds his head in his hands at the situation. He does not ask for the grants that foreign investors demand as a right, he asks only that the playing field be as level as the gently sloping beach of Seaton Carew, which makes it the ideal natural staith, or loading place, for seacoal.</p> <p>John's depot is a few hundred yards from the beach. If an access point was located closer to him, then the Land Rovers would no longer need to drive through the built-up areas. \"We listen to the protesters,\" John says. \"We'll do what's reasonable, compromise, undertake any safety measures. Just don't take our jobs away.\"</p> <p>There are also environmental issues. Land Rovers can no longer gain access to the Middleton basin beach, and the seacoal there is already knee deep. Without Steve's shovel, the beaches of Hartlepool would all begin to resemble the depots. Then there are the melancholy container ships that haunt this coastline, all full of the oil demanded by the chemical industry of Teesside. When the inevitable spill occurs, there are techniques on hand to separate oil from sand, but not for separating coal and oil. The destruction of the seacoalers may not only be a disaster in human terms.</p> <p>More seacoalers arrive on the beach. The hours of the morning are passing, and they must work whilst the tide allows them. They are a close-knit fraternity, but increasingly they have to fragment themselves on the casualised labour market. Lack of vehicle access means they can no longer work a full 12 months. Now they must also work the short-term contracts on offer by local industry. Six weeks here, six weeks there. Or take the dole. A far cry from the proud independence of seacoaling where each man is his own boss.</p> <p>\"See me?\" Steve tells me suddenly. \"I've never had a shilling off the dole.\"</p> <p>And this is what seacoaling is all about.

      "bodyText": "A fresh easterly is the best harvesting wind. It is a bitter blow that chews the face, harries the waves high on to the beach, and tortures the anchored container ships awaiting entrance to Teesport. But it is also the wind that brings in the coal shoals of the North Sea to Hartlepool. No one knows where the seams lie exactly, but every tide lifts its load from the seabed and drags it landward, tumbling and turning through itself like a shoal of black sprat. \"We've been here as long as the gulls,\" Steve Wilkins says as he digs. Seacoaling is a hard way to make a living. Dumped twice a day by the tides on to one of Hartlepool's many beaches, seacoal is fine-grained as congealing tar. A handful of it glitters slightly, and sifts pleasurably through the fingers. But mixed with acrid salt water, sand and other marine particles, it quickly loses any aesthetic qualities. It is heavy, and must be scraped up and loaded on to the specially constructed hold of a Land Rover by means only of a rake and shovel. And a constantly bending back. One load is two tons. On a good day a seacoaler might collect four or five loads from a single tide. Steve once gleaned 18. That's 36 tons with a rake and a shovel. It was the best day he can remember. And the hardest. No day is the same for the seacoalers. They work the tides, and consequently find themselves heading for the foreshore at any and every hour of the 24. Seven days a week. Theirs is the rota of the moon. In all there are about 11 owners of these ex-army surplus Land Rovers. Each with their sidelad. Arriving at the turn of the tide, the seacoalers first locate the coal, then as the tide ebbs they rake it up into long furrows or molehill heaps, depending on the lie of it, and finally load up as the tide waxes again. To be able to do this, day and night, each seacoaler has had to learn to speak the language of the sea as fluently as any fisherman. There are only two of them working the beach tonight. Steve, who owns the vehicle, and his sidelad, Mick. They work in perfect harmony, as smoothly and efficiently as an elegantly constructed piece of machinery. A massive flask of tea squats close by in the sand, vainly waiting for one of the few breaks. There is little chat. Working with the fluxes of the sea, time is of the essence. They are heirs to a long tradition. During the great Northumbrian civilisation of the seventh century, the monks of Blackhall Rocks, just north of Hartlepool, heated their cavernous cells with what they gathered from the tide. Until recently many people in Hartlepool fed their fires with the black crop of the sea. Indeed the figure wheeling a bicycle up from the beach with four bags of seacoal balanced on handle-and crossbars is still common. But the tradition is under threat. A vocal minority, apparently goaded on by a local newspaper, the Hartlepool Mail, are waging a vigorous campaign against the seacoalers. They are concerned about the dangers to pedestrians; an off-the-lead dog has recently been killed under the wheels of a cumbersome Land Rover. Protesters also cite the disturbance from seacoaling vehicles driving through built-up areas to their depots. Having loaded up, Steve now begins the hazardous journey to the depot by driving into the sea. Like soil disturbed by a ploughshare, the water foams from his wheels. One by one Hartlepool borough council is blocking vehicular access to the foreshores, and tonight, since he is working the northern limit of Seaton Carew beach, Steve must round the tip of a sewage pipe. \"See that bonnet?\" he asks, indicating the nose of the Land Rover which is pointing to where the lonely lights of the container ships can be seen twinkling in the open sea. \"When I can see the water on there, then I start to worry.\" Heavily burdened, the Land Rover sinks slightly in the soft sand at the lip of the pipe. A 20ft wave is towering in. Steve eyes it. It breaks. A weird sensation of weightlessness in the cab of this heavy vehicle is followed by the welcome hasp of wheels on denser sand. \"The thing is,\" he smiles. \"I trust my judgment.\" The slow, bouncy track through boulders and rocks up the seabank must be improvised anew with each tide. It is no surprise, given this and the corrosive salt of the sea, that seacoalers must change their Land Rovers once a year. The depot, at which seacoalers are paid by the ton, is closed at this hour, but Steve has a key. Having crossed the small weighbridge, he adds our load to the heap, and quickly turns round. Inexorably the sea is coming in towards the pipe. There will only be one more load tonight. In our absence Steve's son has arrived. One look at his face, and the way he grafts, is to know him as his father's son. Already he has half-filled his own Land Rover. \"Where we live,\" Steve explains, pausing in his shovelling only to glance at his son, \"there's heroin and that. I'm lucky with this young 'un. He knows how to work.\" Later he adds thoughtfully. \"Say if he asks me for money? I point at the Land Rover on the drive. He knows where the beach is.\" In the imagination of some local people, the seacoaler stands with a shovel raised threateningly over his thread and a volley of abuse on his tongue. To some they represent the archetypal roughneck, the shadowy, lazy, even dangerous figure at the margins of the labour market. Fights between different gangs of seacoalers loom large in Hartlepool folklore. \"They think we're scum,\" Steve says as he works. \"Call us the raggy lads, they do. Anything bad happens in the town, then it must have been us.\" This image contrasts with the truth. To seacoal, above all, is to know work. Steve gets home tonight at 11. He must be back at the beach for seven tomorrow morning. Anyone who is remotely lazy, overtly rowdy or too fond of a pint would not last two days working the tide. But not only that. There is a generosity of the spirit. Within 10 minutes of meeting us, Steve had taken the front door key from his fob. \"Stop with us,\" he had offered. The depot is open in time for the first load of the next morning. Even in the light of day this place is black; seacoal permeates everything. As Steve takes us to meet the owner of the depot, John Kirby, his foots sinks up to the ankle. Behind towering slabs of corrugated iron, topped with barbed wire, the machinery for separating sand from coal crouches amongst the heaps, gaunt and rusty like the ghost of a gallows. An image straight from the early years of the industrial revolution. As John shows us round the place, a skylark rises in song from behind one of the heaps. \"They won't win,\" John says with similar soaring energy. \"We'll fight until the end.\" With only a shovel to his name, John's father, Ken, began on the beach just after the war. Seizing one of the few opportunities for the Hartlepudlian entrepreneur, he quickly secured a vehicle for himself, a large eight-ton ex-army truck, then a second, before finally graduating to ownership of a depot. There are six or seven well-known millionaires in Hartlepool who made their start toiling in the bitter easterlies. A tradition of enterprise continued by John, who often loans the money for those seeking to buy their first Land Rover, the beach and its people being a no-go area for banks and other credit agencies. In the heady days of the 60s and 70s, when the local power stations took far larger orders than they do now, Hartlepool Council was forced to issue licences, bestowing its blessing on the enterprise, but before, and since then, the real story has been one of obstacles. Individual seacoalers have frequently found themselves in court for theft, but they have always been acquitted. This is because the Flotsam and Jetsam Act decrees that the booty of the sea is free for all. Seacoaling is the expression of a common right. A fact that the Hartlepool Mail greets with such headlines as: \"Thieves will not be prosecuted.\" All that the council can do now is to block access, which is what they are doing as they gradually redevelop the coastline. On one occasion they laid huge boulders at a strategic point, but some time in the night, when only seacoalers are about, digging machinery ramped the immense blockage with sand. This isn't an example of the perceived anarchy that so enrages the protesters. \"Whoever did that,\" says John with a twinkle in his eye, \"knows that a right of way must be vigorously defended.\" However, the sword of Damocles still hangs. The council are currently waiting for a grant from Maff to develop Seaton Carew front. Plans show that this would finish John and the 40 or 50 people whose jobs are connected with trade. Perhaps this is a way of life dissonant with the image the council wants for the borough, with its new marina and other so-called prestige developments, but in a place where secure jobs and the dignity and stability of family life that go with them are as rare as a skylark above a coal heap, John literally holds his head in his hands at the situation. He does not ask for the grants that foreign investors demand as a right, he asks only that the playing field be as level as the gently sloping beach of Seaton Carew, which makes it the ideal natural staith, or loading place, for seacoal. John's depot is a few hundred yards from the beach. If an access point was located closer to him, then the Land Rovers would no longer need to drive through the built-up areas. \"We listen to the protesters,\" John says. \"We'll do what's reasonable, compromise, undertake any safety measures. Just don't take our jobs away.\" There are also environmental issues. Land Rovers can no longer gain access to the Middleton basin beach, and the seacoal there is already knee deep. Without Steve's shovel, the beaches of Hartlepool would all begin to resemble the depots. Then there are the melancholy container ships that haunt this coastline, all full of the oil demanded by the chemical industry of Teesside. When the inevitable spill occurs, there are techniques on hand to separate oil from sand, but not for separating coal and oil. The destruction of the seacoalers may not only be a disaster in human terms. More seacoalers arrive on the beach. The hours of the morning are passing, and they must work whilst the tide allows them. They are a close-knit fraternity, but increasingly they have to fragment themselves on the casualised labour market. Lack of vehicle access means they can no longer work a full 12 months. Now they must also work the short-term contracts on offer by local industry. Six weeks here, six weeks there. Or take the dole. A far cry from the proud independence of seacoaling where each man is his own boss. \"See me?\" Steve tells me suddenly. \"I've never had a shilling off the dole.\" And this is what seacoaling is all about. The dignity of independence. It is hard to imagine more resourceful entrepreneurs. To bring up a family with values of work and independence in this bleakest of job environments is a stunning achievement. On some estates, devastated by the winds of change and decline, a wind as bitter as the local coastal blows, unemployment touches 30%. These are the grafters who have answered the age-old paradox of the riddle song Scarborough Fair and have managed to plough that elusive acre of ground lying \"between the sea foam and the sea sand\". Having loaded up, Steve pauses for a moment. The North Sea is breaking itself just where the Land Rovers must go. He gazes at it, his face held in the teeth of the chewing wind. He is one of the few people in Hartlepool who likes these cruel sea winds. This is because he knows, as long generations of seacoalers have always known, that a fresh easterly, no matter how cold, is the best harvesting wind. \u0095 Jonathan Tulloch's second novel, The Bonny Lads, is published by Jonathan Cape, priced \u00a310.",

Eventually, I got out of solitary and had access to a lot more materials, including watercolour and oil paints.</p> <p>\"We had excellent teachers and artists in residence, including Professor Brian Maguire, from Trinity College Dublin, who has painted portraits of all sorts of people, from Charlie Haughey [former Irish prime minister] to Martin Cahill [Dublin gangster]. Brian slept on my wing for six months.</p> <p>\"Prisoners were allowed to paint their cells any colour, but mine was a like a rainbow because I was always wiping my brushes on the wall. I suppose the colours were a reaction against the dull surroundings, and I also included metallic touches, an echo of the prison bars.</p> <p>\"For a while, there was a high sheen off everything because I could only get gloss, and everything was a square 2ft by 2ft, so that it could fit through the X-ray machine for visitors to take home.\" Stone soon found his talents in demand, drawing birthday and Christmas cards for fellow inmates and prison officers, and realised some of his work was taking longer to get out of the prison because the governors were showing it off to guests.</p> <p>\"I wanted to do bigger stuff but didn't have canvases, so I sawed up a table and a wardrobe, glued bits together and pulled linen sheets over them. Eventually, the screws caught on and I was given polyester sheets, which didn't quite work.\"</p> <p>Stone is still painting and wants to mount an exhibition in the near future. He is well aware there is a certain morbid curiosity about his work because of his violent past but says others' perceptions are outside his control. \"I know people are thinking the hands that painted these pictures killed people. Yes, I regret taking life and that is with me every day. I wanted to take out top republicans, leadership, [Gerry] Adams, [Martin] McGuinness, not others.</p> <p>\"I can't go back on that aim, but I am glad there is peace. I support the principles of the Good Friday agreement but many things are not working out in practice.\"</p> <p>He spends time each week teaching art to teenagers in deprived areas of east Belfast, something he gets great satisfaction from. \"Sure, I'm like some Rambo character to them when they first meet me and they ask questions about what I did. But I just tell them it isn't big and clever to kill people. Then we get down to work, making things and doing things.</p> <p>\"There aren't a lot of jobs or facilities in their area but they're good kids and they've got to be encouraged to make the most of what they have.\"</p> <p>Stone's paintings are not overtly political but some have topical themes. He points to a large, rectangular piece, called Good Friday agreement, where a seated figure, representing unionism, balances precariously on a pendulum of orange and green, indicating the difficulties beneath the surface.</p> <p>Around this are silver and gold masks and hands, which he says represent the silent majority, both Protestant and Catholic, who want peace but are troubled by how the accord is shaping up. All the symbols appear to be bursting out of a cell-like room, signifying how hard it is to fit all the ideals of unionism and nationalism into narrow confines.</p> <p>Other paintings, like Seated Bather, have some religious connotation. He says the orange figure partially represents Eve, with the Salvador Dali-type holes in her snake-like limbs showing the decay brought by sin. \"But I don't take myself too seriously,\" he claims. \"People will always read more than is really there, but that's up to them. Sometimes I just add a little joke, like a tiny lizard peeping out from under a leaf.\"</p> <p>His pictures, which he used to give away or sell for a few pounds in prison, now fetch anywhere between a couple of hundred and a couple of thousand pounds. But he is dismissive of any suggestion he could make his fortune.</p> <p>For one thing, he's still under death threat from dissident republicans, and he and his fianc\u00e9e, Suzanne, move from place to place, each safe house protected by a raft of bulletproof windows, steel doors and security cameras. He knows that killing him, a loyalist icon, could spark revenge with the potential to reignite serious sectarian violence.</p> <p>\"I have more bars on the windows now than when I was in the Maze,\" he says. \"Do you know what Suzanne and I got each other for Christmas? His and hers body armour.\"</p> <p>\"I've got seven dogs and I keep tropical fish - I've even had the glass in their tanks reinforced. I don't want you to hear that Michael Stone has been drowned because the bullets hit the fish tanks.</p> <p>\"I'm looking over my shoulder 24 hours a day. Some people might call it paranoia but I call it not getting complacent. But I know there will always be people out to get me, after what I did. I live with that every day but I just want to keep my head down and get on with my life.\"</p>",

I suppose the colours were a reaction against the dull surroundings, and I also included metallic touches, an echo of the prison bars. \"For a while, there was a high sheen off everything because I could only get gloss, and everything was a square 2ft by 2ft, so that it could fit through the X-ray machine for visitors to take home.\" Stone soon found his talents in demand, drawing birthday and Christmas cards for fellow inmates and prison officers, and realised some of his work was taking longer to get out of the prison because the governors were showing it off to guests. \"I wanted to do bigger stuff but didn't have canvases, so I sawed up a table and a wardrobe, glued bits together and pulled linen sheets over them. Eventually, the screws caught on and I was given polyester sheets, which didn't quite work.\" Stone is still painting and wants to mount an exhibition in the near future. He is well aware there is a certain morbid curiosity about his work because of his violent past but says others' perceptions are outside his control. \"I know people are thinking the hands that painted these pictures killed people. Yes, I regret taking life and that is with me every day. I wanted to take out top republicans, leadership, [Gerry] Adams, [Martin] McGuinness, not others. \"I can't go back on that aim, but I am glad there is peace. I support the principles of the Good Friday agreement but many things are not working out in practice.\" He spends time each week teaching art to teenagers in deprived areas of east Belfast, something he gets great satisfaction from. \"Sure, I'm like some Rambo character to them when they first meet me and they ask questions about what I did. But I just tell them it isn't big and clever to kill people. Then we get down to work, making things and doing things. \"There aren't a lot of jobs or facilities in their area but they're good kids and they've got to be encouraged to make the most of what they have.\" Stone's paintings are not overtly political but some have topical themes. He points to a large, rectangular piece, called Good Friday agreement, where a seated figure, representing unionism, balances precariously on a pendulum of orange and green, indicating the difficulties beneath the surface. Around this are silver and gold masks and hands, which he says represent the silent majority, both Protestant and Catholic, who want peace but are troubled by how the accord is shaping up. All the symbols appear to be bursting out of a cell-like room, signifying how hard it is to fit all the ideals of unionism and nationalism into narrow confines. Other paintings, like Seated Bather, have some religious connotation. He says the orange figure partially represents Eve, with the Salvador Dali-type holes in her snake-like limbs showing the decay brought by sin. \"But I don't take myself too seriously,\" he claims. \"People will always read more than is really there, but that's up to them. Sometimes I just add a little joke, like a tiny lizard peeping out from under a leaf.\" His pictures, which he used to give away or sell for a few pounds in prison, now fetch anywhere between a couple of hundred and a couple of thousand pounds. But he is dismissive of any suggestion he could make his fortune. For one thing, he's still under death threat from dissident republicans, and he and his fianc\u00e9e, Suzanne, move from place to place, each safe house protected by a raft of bulletproof windows, steel doors and security cameras. He knows that killing him, a loyalist icon, could spark revenge with the potential to reignite serious sectarian violence. \"I have more bars on the windows now than when I was in the Maze,\" he says. \"Do you know what Suzanne and I got each other for Christmas? His and hers body armour.\" \"I've got seven dogs and I keep tropical fish - I've even had the glass in their tanks reinforced. I don't want you to hear that Michael Stone has been drowned because the bullets hit the fish tanks. \"I'm looking over my shoulder 24 hours a day. Some people might call it paranoia but I call it not getting complacent. But I know there will always be people out to get me, after what I did. I live with that every day but I just want to keep my head down and get on with my life.\"",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 David \"Starsky &amp; Hutch\" Soul makes an appearance in BBC1's Holby City next week as Professor Alan Fletcher. Fortunately for those who would prefer to remember Detective Ken Hutchinson the way he was in his heyday, Fletcher will, we can exclusively reveal, have a penchant for aviator shades and flares, and will be seen tearing around in a souped-up red 1974 Ford Torino. Rumours that Antonio \"Huggy Bear\" Fargas is to join the Ballykissangel cast, playing a mobile library driver with connections in the County Wicklow underworld remain unconfirmed. David, though, has revealed that he is still in touch with Antonio and Paul Michael Glaser. But, he adds: \"I don't think a new series of Starsky and Hutch is on the cards.\" \u0095 Meanwhile, a welcome return for, arguably, the funniest book of the century. Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim, is currently being filmed for broadcast this autumn. Stephen Tomkinson is lined up to star as the luckless academic, Jim Dixon. Also starring are Helen McCrory, Robert Hardy, and Keeley Hawes.",

McKevitt is the first person to be charged with directing terrorism under a law introduced in Ireland after the 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people. Rupert is expected to be a key witness at the judge-only trial due to open in Dublin's special criminal court on April 24. Rupert, a 49-year-old former lorry driver from Illinois, is understood to have first contacted the Irish Freedom Committee in Chicago four years ago. With no permanent home, he described himself as a descendant of German immigrants and Mohawk Indians. He acted as a fundraiser and soon became the main representative in the US of the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, whose paramilitary is the Real IRA. Rupert soon became disillusioned with the Real IRA and started providing information about his activities to the FBI and MI5. But his work in the US had so impressed McKevitt and his wife, Bernadette - the sister of Bobby Sands, one of the IRA hunger strikers who died in 1981 - that he was invited to Ireland. While from 1998 the FBI and MI5 used information provided by Rupert to monitor the movement of Real IRA funds to a bank in the Irish border town of Dundalk, McKevitt's home town, Rupert was addressing Real IRA rallies in the town and across Ireland. Security sources say McKevitt took to Rupert and introduced him to real IRA leaders, including the army council. Rupert passed information about the group's leaders and meetings to the FBI and MI5 which began to share the intelligence with the Garda, the Irish police. The Garda are believed to have bugged Real IRA meet ings and secretly filmed its leaders. Then last year, McKevitt allegedly asked Rupert to commit a terrorist offence. It was the prospect of this evidence being produced in court that prompted the Irish police to ask the FBI and MI5 if they could \"blow\" their agent.

They've briefly been drawn back to what they used to be called. This is because it's widely believed that supergrasses and witnesses in terrorist trials are relocated to the Antipodes with fresh identities. </p> <p>That story has such power because witness protection schemes represent an extreme example of a common human dream: to start anew somewhere else. The Whistleblower, the BBC1's big Easter drama, depicts the experience of people who have never been to drama school but are suddenly asked to become actors for the rest of their lives. </p> <p>Laura Tracey (Amanda Burton), a lowly clerk at a London family bank, has discovered that her employers are a dollar laundrette for a Panamanian drug-trafficking gang. She agrees to photocopy documents for the fraud squad and the FBI, who are in on the operation so that the drama can also sell to American markets. Added international appeal is provided by a top Mexican hit-man, who comes to England to take out Laura as revenge for her evidence at the trial of the cartel and the bankers. </p> <p>Laura's life can only be protected, British security concludes, by providing her with a different one. Mrs Tracey becomes Mrs Godfrey. Her children are taught new names and pasts in a serious version of a dressing-up game. In this sequence, there are strong hints that Patrick Harbison's script might have wanted to go deeper than the piece's populist ambitions permit. </p> <p>It's a sweet detail, for example, that both Laura and her husband Dominic (Neil Pearson) are given cover identities that consist of lives that they have carefully avoided. Ambitious for a career, she is redefined as a housewife while he, a college lecturer, is downgraded to schoolteacher. </p> <p>But, frustratingly, this fascinating material - a forced transformation in middle-age - is rapidly abandoned in favour of car chases and footage of the family shot through the sights of an assassin's rifle. The existing sexual secrets, which threaten the new secret life, also feel already-seen. </p> <p>There's a double irony in the fact that the theme of The Whistleblower is deep disguise. The first is that, in its plot essentials, the two-part drama sometimes feels as if it used to be called something else. Specifically, you feel that the idea was born as The Insider, the classy American movie in which Russell Crowe ratted on the tobacco business. In fact, if you were asked to publicise this film, you'd pitch it as a cross between The Insider and Erin Brockovich. </p> <p>But both of those movies, based on real stories, had a documentary edge in both detail and execution. The problem for The Whisteblower is that it's in the nature of the story that it couldn't draw on actual narratives without putting lives at risk. </p> <p>In another more crucial second sense, story and reality come together. Playing a woman trying to convince the world that she is someone else, Amanda Burton is an actress desperate to make viewers forget a previous identity. BBC drama is currently struggling, with cherished projects being out-rated by ITV: the brilliant Clocking Off (reviewed here last week) is the latest show to fight Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and lose. </p> <p>In this bleak period, the autopsy drama Silent Witness has been one of the few pieces showing consistent signs of life, establishing Burton as a bankable actress. Now, by playing a banker, the actress hopes to show her range as a performer. </p> <p>In the most recent Silent Witness, her character developed cancer, an intimation of the franchise's mortality. Just like the MI5 disguise team played by Bill Patterson and Penelope Wilton in The Whistleblower, the BBC drama department has enrolled her in the integrity protection programme, trying to construct a new identity. </p> <p>The dark hair she wore in Silent Witness is dyed blonde, the abrasive Ulster accent is softened to City posh. She is very different, and that may be a problem. </p> <p>Between the people who produce drama and the people who perform it, there are two main disagreements. One is over how much actors should be paid; the other concerns exactly how much acting they should do. Performers regard it as a measure of their skill if they become unrecognisable in a part but, for producers, it can be a disaster. </p> <p>The late Alec Guinness made one of his rare returns to the stage in the role of a transvestite who spent the first act in a wig and dress. At the interval, two members of the audience were heard to ask loudly when Guinness was coming on. Similarly, in The Whistleblower, Burton acts well, but perhaps too well for the BBC's immediate cynical ratings needs. </p> <p>Though distracted too often by shooty-bangs, the script contains some very nice lines. Pressed by the security services on why she has money stashed in a secret account, Laura replies: \"I was going to run away. Start a new life.\" Showing how that human fantasy can become a nightmare, The Whistleblower could do with a better disguise of its generic history and a central performer less keen to make her known self disappear.</p> <p>\u0095 The Whistleblower, Easter Sunday, 8.40pm, BBC1.</p>",

It's a sweet detail, for example, that both Laura and her husband Dominic (Neil Pearson) are given cover identities that consist of lives that they have carefully avoided. Ambitious for a career, she is redefined as a housewife while he, a college lecturer, is downgraded to schoolteacher. But, frustratingly, this fascinating material - a forced transformation in middle-age - is rapidly abandoned in favour of car chases and footage of the family shot through the sights of an assassin's rifle. The existing sexual secrets, which threaten the new secret life, also feel already-seen. There's a double irony in the fact that the theme of The Whistleblower is deep disguise. The first is that, in its plot essentials, the two-part drama sometimes feels as if it used to be called something else. Specifically, you feel that the idea was born as The Insider, the classy American movie in which Russell Crowe ratted on the tobacco business. In fact, if you were asked to publicise this film, you'd pitch it as a cross between The Insider and Erin Brockovich. But both of those movies, based on real stories, had a documentary edge in both detail and execution. The problem for The Whisteblower is that it's in the nature of the story that it couldn't draw on actual narratives without putting lives at risk. In another more crucial second sense, story and reality come together. Playing a woman trying to convince the world that she is someone else, Amanda Burton is an actress desperate to make viewers forget a previous identity. BBC drama is currently struggling, with cherished projects being out-rated by ITV: the brilliant Clocking Off (reviewed here last week) is the latest show to fight Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and lose. In this bleak period, the autopsy drama Silent Witness has been one of the few pieces showing consistent signs of life, establishing Burton as a bankable actress. Now, by playing a banker, the actress hopes to show her range as a performer. In the most recent Silent Witness, her character developed cancer, an intimation of the franchise's mortality. Just like the MI5 disguise team played by Bill Patterson and Penelope Wilton in The Whistleblower, the BBC drama department has enrolled her in the integrity protection programme, trying to construct a new identity. The dark hair she wore in Silent Witness is dyed blonde, the abrasive Ulster accent is softened to City posh. She is very different, and that may be a problem. Between the people who produce drama and the people who perform it, there are two main disagreements. One is over how much actors should be paid; the other concerns exactly how much acting they should do. Performers regard it as a measure of their skill if they become unrecognisable in a part but, for producers, it can be a disaster. The late Alec Guinness made one of his rare returns to the stage in the role of a transvestite who spent the first act in a wig and dress. At the interval, two members of the audience were heard to ask loudly when Guinness was coming on. Similarly, in The Whistleblower, Burton acts well, but perhaps too well for the BBC's immediate cynical ratings needs. Though distracted too often by shooty-bangs, the script contains some very nice lines. Pressed by the security services on why she has money stashed in a secret account, Laura replies: \"I was going to run away. Start a new life.\" Showing how that human fantasy can become a nightmare, The Whistleblower could do with a better disguise of its generic history and a central performer less keen to make her known self disappear. \u0095 The Whistleblower, Easter Sunday, 8.40pm, BBC1.",

(Of course, he is far too good-looking to play someone Victorian but no matter. This is TV, after all.) Unlike his performance in Rebel Heart, here D'Arcy's permanently teary eyes were an advantage. After all, it isn't much fun living humbly in ignominy and not being able to smack your uncle in the kisser because it isn't very Victorian and he's Charles Dance.

Actually, things being what they are, it probably wouldn't, even now. </p> <p>Similarly, D'Arcy's blank, equine face was suited to a character whose formative experiences were yet to mark themselves upon him. Here was an emotionally naive boy-man who still knew what society expected of him, and D'Arcy's eyes conveyed both admirably.

Occasionally, Nicholas had the look of someone who had just had a filling and was waiting for the anaesthetic to wear off. </p> <p>The rest of the cast were of a suitable calibre, even if the roles were cartoonish stereotypes.

      "bodyText": "So Lisa did it. Last week it was revealed to a breathless nation that she was the would-be assassin who had gunned down EastEnders' hard man Phil Mitchell. And the nation was not that surprised - all the possibilities had been thoroughly trawled for weeks. What was truly astonishing was that Lisa had gone all that time without telling anyone, including her best pal Mel, who was also on the suspect list after enjoying a secret night of passion with Phil. But Lucy Benjamin, the actor who plays Lisa, confessed last Friday that she had been unable to remain quite so tight-lipped and had told her mum of her character's guilt. Women tell each other secrets all the time. It scares men (most of whom limit their daily interchanges to solid stuff, like football scores) rigid. Secrets are how a bloke's cheerful, harmless one-night stand gets turned, 30 Chinese whispers later, into a full-blown love affair and betrayal.
