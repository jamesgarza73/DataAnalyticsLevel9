      "body": "<p>Everyone says you can do your shopping, find a job, even meet your future life-partner over the internet - but what about something really tricky? Can you trust cyberspace with your holiday? </p> <p>Normally you wouldn't have to. If you're considering a popular destination, there'll be no shortage of people lining up to recommend their favourite village/hotel/resort. Their tips, plus a couple of brochures and a guide book, will usually do the trick. </p> <p>But what about somewhere much further from home, a place less travelled? What about New Zealand? </p> <p>We knew we wanted to make a long trip - a month - to the other side of the world, and we didn't want to be hopping from hotel to hotel. We wanted to dig in, rent a house and use it as a base. Mention that gameplan, and you won't get too many friends or colleagues rushing forward with the usual France or Italy response: \"Oh, you must stay in...\" or \"We found the most gorgeous...\" </p> <p>If it was guidance we were after, then it would be necessary to dip into the collective pool of wisdom that is the internet. The opening shot was a hit on Tourism New Zealand's heavily-promoted site, <a href=\"http://www.purenz.com\">www.purenz.com</a>. Besides a lushly-illustrated area dedicated to New Zealand's trademark passion for extreme sports - \"the thrill zone\" - the site also promises info on more humdrum pursuits, such as finding accommodation. In all, there were 92 homes listed. But no matter that several of the first houses I saw looked ideal - I felt compelled to check out the other sites, just in case. So I began clicking on <a href=\"http://www.holidayhomes.co.nz\" target=\"_NEW\">www.holidayhomes.co.nz</a>, which led in turn to <a href=\"http://www.nzholidayhomes.co.nz\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nzholidayhomes.co.za</a>.</p> <p>But fear not, the search did not go on forever: you will not be drowning in choice. Those two sites are the lead players in their field, and once you've narrowed down geographically - we were only interested in the Auckland region - and drawn up a few criteria - we decided that living in a yacht and sailing around the Pacific was probably beyond us - you need only look at about a dozen houses closely. </p> <p>Here's where the internet shows off both its strengths and its weaknesses. Upside: the process of elimination meant that the homes we were looking at were all plausible contenders; it was like flicking through a brochure that had been customised especially for us. Downside: reading a hard-copy brochure is a lot less time-consuming and annoying than waiting for pictures of beach-huts to download and for graphics to pixellate before your eyes. </p> <p>One of the real advantages is that once you've found the two or three houses you like best, you can get in touch with the owner or agent immediately, because almost every entry on nzholidayhomes.co.nz comes with an e-mail address. We fired off three or four instant messages to a country that would take too long to contact via \"snail mail\" asking on what dates the houses were free, how near they were to the beach and how on earth any home which appeared to have just two bedrooms could \"sleep 15 comfortably\". </p> <p>The e-mails came back within a few days. Two of our favourite three were not available for our preferred dates, but one was free. We would be able to spend a long week on Piha beach, in a house that looked like a paradise retreat - at least in the full-colour pictures posted on its very own website: <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/piha_house/\">www.geocities.com/piha_house/</a>. The bedroom appeared to open directly on to the ocean, and the entire front of the house seemed to be constructed of glass doors, all of which opened out on to a wide deck. Throughout, our entire relationship with Vicki, the house owner, was con ducted in the cyber-ether. She e-mailed us dates and rates, and even an electronic application form. We paid the deposit by bank transfer and the whole deal was done with not a piece of paper, or even a phone call, passed between us. </p> <p>But the internet can't do everything. We still hadn't got anywhere to stay for the rest of our trip, and time was running out. Vicki e-mailed us the name of an agent who might help, and he had a few suggestions. It was then that a low-tech urge took over. I reached for the telephone. </p> <p>Although he had told me, via e-mail, about assorted houses in the Auckland area, the agent had no pictures and no formal details of the one that sounded best: it had only just become available for rent. With nothing firm to go on, I somehow needed to hear the sound of his voice - just to be reassured that we were not going to pitch up, suitcases in hand, at a building site sandwiched between Auckland's central railway station and a power plant. </p> <p>It was irrational - he could have lied over the phone just as easily as in an e-mail - but I wanted to speak to a real, rather than virtual, human. By making voice-contact, he could answer all my questions at once, rather than in the staccato back-and-forth of e-mail. And it was then I realised that the internet cannot do it all; it can't replace every tool of travel-craft. Instead it takes its place alongside all the rest. </p> <p>So, when one website suggested a cottage in Waiheke Island, we turned to a good old-fashioned guidebook to read about the area before deciding if we wanted to stay there. We also printed on to paper the details of potential houses, so we could mark them in pen and lay them out on the kitchen table - neither of which you can do on a screen. </p> <p>Nowhere illustrates that useful but limited role for the internet more than booking a flight. I went first to the <a href=\"http://britishairways.com\" target=\"_NEW\">British Airways</a> and <a href=\"http://www.qantas.com\">Quantas</a> websites and they let me know that I could fly to Auckland by heading west, via Los Angeles, rather than east via Bangkok and Sydney. But you'd hesitate before booking with them, because you'd always suspect tickets were available more cheaply elsewhere, including a traditional agent. </p> <p>I went to the other extreme, logging on to <a href=\"http://www.cheapflights.co.uk\">www.cheapflights.co.uk</a>, but most of their roads lead to agents with old-tech phone numbers. For actual booking online, I could have gone to <a href=\"http://www.expedia.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">ww.expedia.co.uk</a>, but I had been put off by experience. Last year, I tried to book a flight with them but, thanks to a confusion when entering credit card details, I ended up convinced I had bought the same ticket twice - a problem only resolved with an old-fashioned phone call. My rule now is that the internet is fine for gathering info on flights but, when it comes to parting with actual money, stick with tradition. </p> <p>By the time of our trip, we had done it all - thanks to the internet and a few phonecalls. We hadn't used a travel agent, or even a brochure. As a failsafe, we printed up all the e-mail correspondence and stashed it in a suitcase lid. When we couldn't remember where to find the keys for the beachhouse in Piha, it was all there, in comforting black-and-white. </p> <p>And what was it like? Did the graphics of the world wide web lie? Was the internet a handy front for tricksters and con-artists? No, it was not. The first house we stayed at was a spacious, roomy home on Castor Bay - with a pool that opened out onto a grassy lawn, ending in a calm, sunny beach. Though just 15 minutes' drive from the city of Auckland, we went to sleep each night to the sounds of waves, lapping against the shore. </p> <p>The beachhouse at Piha may have been a bit more rugged than the pictures suggested, and no website quite conveys that slightly damp, beach-front smell - but no brochure would either. Still, to open up the entire home, bedroom and living room, each morning to what is one of the most spectacular beaches in the world - just along the coast from Karekare, where Jane Campion filmed the stunning opening of The Piano - was a pleasure to savour. To eat fresh fish, barbecued on the deck, every night under a bright, Southern Hemisphere sky, is a feeling even the internet cannot convey. </p> <p>One more tip: don't leave the web behind. Whether you take a computer with you, or log in at any of the internet caf\u00e9s, you can still use cyberspace to navigate your trip. We checked out the quixotic grandeur of the Grand Chateau - an extravagant English-style country mansion at the foot of a volcano in the middle of the Tongariro National Park - online at <a href=\"http://www.chateau.co.nz,\">www.chateau.co.nz</a>, and sorted out four comfortable nights in Wellington thanks to the City Life apartments, discovered at <a href=\"http://www.dynasty.co.nz\">www.dynasty.co.nz.</a>.</p> <p>You can't do it all on the internet, but you can do a lot. It's a tool that will soon become as indispensable to the traveller as a credit card and passport. But it won't change the experience: as every traveller knows, there is nothing virtual about that. It's all real.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Air fares tumbled last year as a vicious price battle raged in the skies between the new no-frills budget airlines. But there is growing evidence that the rock-bottom bargains of 2000 may never be repeated, with fares this year on a firm upward trend and in some cases rising steeply. </p> <p>In a report published last week American Express, which runs an index of air travel prices, said the no-frills carriers are under increasing pressure and are likely to become \"less attractive\" in 2001. </p> <p>Amex director Matthew Davis said: \"High operating costs, such as fuel prices and airport fees, are starting to affect the financial performance of the low-cost airlines. The fare gap between traditional and low-cost airlines is narrowing and this is likely to continue into 2001.\" </p> <p>Amex's findings are borne out by a snapshot survey of fares offered by Ryanair, Go, Buzz and EasyJet. The results (see below) reveal that although bargains can be found, \"budget\" short-haul fares frequently cost more than \u00a3150. We also compared fares with British Airways' standard charges and found that while the flag carrier was usually more expensive, there are flights where it beats the so-called cheap airlines on price. </p> <p>Mr Davis predicts that the budget airlines will increasingly switch from marketing ultra-low prices to advertising destinations, convenience and frequency. For example, last year Go, the fast-growing but until recently heavily loss-making airline currently up for sale from BA, was promoting fares to Barcelona for \u00a340 return, inclusive of tax. Such was the popularity of the offer, plus similar offers from EasyJet to Barcelona, that the Catalonian capital recently overtook Paris as the most popular overseas weekend destination for Britons. </p> <p>But Go's current television advertising focuses on routes rather than prices, and in our survey we found that its fares to Barcelona were \u00a3108-\u00a3198. Go sales and marketing director David Magliano says: \"It's true that we haven't repeated the absolute rock bottom promotional fares of January last year, but we have had a larger number of smaller promotional offers.\" </p> <p>He insists that the savings Go makes by using internet bookings rather than agents cancel out the sharp rise in fuel costs. He also claims that Go will never charge more than 50% of the full economy fare on a traditional airline. </p> <p>Both EasyJet and Ryanair are facing severe cost pressures at their home airports. When EasyJet opened services from Luton Airport, it negotiated a five-year deal where the airport earned just \u00a31.60 per passenger plus a 62p handling charge. Luton wants \u00a37.89 per passenger, and two weeks ago reached an interim deal where EasyJet will pay a fee believed to be \u00a35 to \u00a36 per passenger. </p> <p> EasyJet insists that this will not lead to higher prices, but it is axing its Luton-Liverpool route, which started at \u00a320 return. \"It's just not commercially viable to offer services at that price,\" says an EasyJet spokeswoman. She says expansion plans at Luton are now on hold while it develops alternative hubs at Geneva, Amsterdam and Liverpool. </p> <p>Ryanair is facing similar cost pressures. Like EasyJet, it is engaged in a highly public battle with Aer Rianta, the operators of Dublin Airport, which it says is Europe's most expensive airport. </p> <p>Ryanair's low fares have also been supported by ultra-cheap fees at the small airports that it flies to. But they are likely to end, claims one senior airline industry figure, who did not wish to be named. \"Some airports were almost paying the likes of Ryanair to fly to them.

We wanted a degree of privacy, a villa rather than a hotel; my son demanded a flat place to play football, and preferably Sky television to fulfil his insatiable need to watch the vile sport; my husband wanted some diving thrown in; it had to be hot - but not too hot; then there should be some things to do and see - but not too many people doing and seeing them. Tennis courts would be nice. A swimming pool, of course. Not too expensive. And, most vital of all, excellent child-care to help look after Iona, our severely disabled six-year-old daughter. </p> <p>After much exhaustive research, many false leads and a number of frustrated travel agents, we finally settled on Zakynthos. The island suffered a massive earthquake in 1953, destroying much of its Venetian architecture, but we were assured it remained a beautiful destination, espe cially where we were heading, the Vassilikos peninsula with its unspoilt countryside, abundant forest and some of the best Ionian beaches. </p> <p>There were a couple of minor hiccups when we arrived: Iona's buggy was not waiting for us on the Tarmac upon arrival, but wending its way round the luggage carousel. And then the miniature hire car that awaited us could only take one bag in its boot. But we were soon all squished in and scooting round the coastline that led to the villa Kaliopi, our home for a fortnight. </p> <p>The heat was stifling, so hot that none of us slept that night. But when the next day eventually dawned, a cooling breeze blew off the sea and the children's club opened. It was beyond my expectations; I have never before met such capable, down-to-earth nannies. A programme of activities designed to keep the children out of the heat was both stimulating and fun. Needless to say, they could hardly wait to get stuck into whatever that day offered, from messing about with papier-m\u00e2che to nature walks and pirate treasure hunts, and they all left with enormous bundles of home-made mementos. </p> <p>Iona was quickly integrated with the other children, squashed, cuddled and adored as she joined in fully with their activities. One of my lasting memories was Iona being happily dragged around the swimming pool by one of her more able-bodied friends. </p> <p>With the child-care sorted, mum and dad were left with time to get on with doing nothing. Lying round the pool, soaking up the sun, and reading books kept us going for the first few days. We ate at family-friendly restaurants, all of which had outside play areas, good, simple grilled food and lovely fresh Greek salads. </p> <p>Eventually, we stirred from our torpor and began exploring the rocky headland, discovering beautiful, empty coves. Snorkelling became a new passion for my nine-year-old son, although he was dismayed to have missed his father's tug-of-war with an octopus because he was too busy observing a sea slug at the time. </p> <p>A regular walk through the olive groves, past the goats, sheep, turkeys, ducks and bee hives took us to our favourite breakfast caf\u00e9 for an iced coffee and a vast bowl of honey and yogurt, and then it was on to Gerakas bay, one of the island's finest beaches with a beautiful crescent of golden sand that didn't start filling up with tourists until the late morning. Days quickly settled into idle routines and we started unwinding. </p> <p>The second week, we became marginally less sedentary. Although none of us could ride, we booked a horse-riding trip, which gave us an entirely different perspective on Zakynthos. Following small mountain and agricultural paths we discovered a rural way of life that must have been unchanged for decades. </p> <p>Feeling bolder, we took an all-day trip on a glass-bottomed boat to see the loggerhead turtles which struggle to co-exist with the island's tourists. The day was beautiful, the sky clear and the sea calm. First stop was a trip to some caves, the dappled light giving the impression of being in a lit swimming pool at night, then on for some daredevil boat driving through weird, narrow rock formations, a stop for freshly-grilled sardines and some swimming off the satellite islands. </p> <p>But there was no sign of the elusive turtles, and we could see why: scores of sun seekers were lying under beach umbrellas driven into the sand that serves as the turtles' protected breeding grounds. Then, as we motored back to port, we spotted our first, and only, turtle, a magnificent creature which surfaced only a metre or so from our boat. </p> <p>My husband was first overboard, keen to swim with the turtle for as long as he could. My son jumped in, forgetting his mask or flippers. Having momentarily eyeballed the beast, he suddenly realised he couldn't cope with the large sea swell and the wake from the boat. After an emergency rescue, he watched from the relative security of the boat as the turtle dived and surfaced with my husband in tow. </p> <p>Further excursions to Banana Beach for that truly Greek experience, sitting in inner tubes being hauled at great speed round the nearby coastline, did wonders for the cellulite if not the nerves. </p> <p>And on the one cloudy day we experienced, we drove down a suicidally-steep hill to a near deserted bay, an hour of body surfing and then the most memorable meal of all, with grilled squid and giant prawns. </p> <p>We failed on some fronts.

      "body": "<p>The first time I went to Jamaica, I didn't know much about the place beyond a vague impression of pirates, palm trees, No\u00ebl Coward, ganja and beneath that a sense of intensity, a lurking voluptuous danger. </p> <p>I reported the booking of last-minute flights to my fellow traveller as a fait accompli. \"Oh dear\" she said, \"I forgot to tell you. Jamaica's the only place I don't want to go. It's meant to be dangerous.\" But the tickets were non-refundable. </p> <p>It's true Jamaica has the second highest murder rate in the world. It's true the place is rife with guns, drugs and corruption - although mostly confined to Kingston, the non-touristy capital. As the Buddhists say - big front, big backie, the great vibrancy and passion of the place has its dark side. It also has it's bright side - an extraordinary enthusiasm for life, for the drama of it all, for language and sexuality and music and strife. </p> <p>On this trip, I returned for two weeks over the New Year period and divided my time between two beach resorts; Ocho Rios on the north coast and Negril on the west. This is the high season and the busiest and most expensive time in Jamaica. The weather was unreliable though so, if you like your heat hot, go between April and July, it's less crowded and the sun is full on - but not unbearable. </p> <p>I went with a different girlfriend, as yet unmarried - although she did receive a couple of proposals en route. Ocho Rios, is a small town that once lived off the bauxite mines and now lives off tourism. It's affectionately known as Ochy. </p> <p>Ocho Rios is one of the few places in Jamaica where it's quite hard to escape the dreaded package holiday all-inclusives, such as Sandals. Although beaches are in principle free to all in Jamaica, in practice the hotels fence them off. The upshot is you can't get to most of them. Nor can the local kids. Even though 20 years ago their parents played there with freedom. </p> <p>The answer for the tourist is to go to extremes - rough it or spend top dollar. Both have their charms. If you're on a budget there are guest houses such as Tommy's \"Happy Grove\" where the garden is full of trees groaning with mangoes, avocados and bread fruit - never mind the roar of the air-conditioning units from the resorts on either side. In the day times, a short drive out of town, you can hang out on Reggae Beach - a \"Jamaican beach\", meaning the locals go there. Here you can swing under the sea-grape tree listening to music and drinking a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda - with not an all-inclusive in sight. </p> <p>The luxury option accommodation-wise is the Jamaica Inn. Old-world this is, but charming with it. The rooms are lovely, each with a patio the size of a large living room opening on to a turquoise sea, a pale gold beach or a lovely tropical garden. </p> <p>Once the preserve of the plantation set, the hotel has had to move with the times. Rich Jamaicans are to be seen in the dining room sporting Chanel handbags, and they serve a Jamaican breakfast: ackee (a kind of fruit that looks like scrambled eggs) and callaloo (spinach). But you can still play croquet on the lawn, and the waiters still wear white coats and carry breakfast trays on their heads. </p> <p>There are amusing day trips from Ocho Rios - if you're so inclined. There's a tour of Coward's hilltop pad, Firefly, which remains a rare unreconstructed tourist experience - you get the feeling you're having a clandestine look around someone's house while they've popped out for a moment; the table laid just as it was when Princess Margaret came to dinner, and, most touching of all, the old chap's battered saucepans hanging in the kitchenette. A statue of Coward sits looking out over the bay and his songs issue eternally from a small speaker hanging in a tree. </p> <p>At the other end of the musical spectrum, there's a trip to Bob Marley's birthplace, Nine Miles, situated in the hilly interior of the island. Here, Rastas show you round the musician's elaborate marble tomb. </p> <p>It's hard to go to Jamaica and not be imbued with Marley fever. This diminutive half-white lyrical genius came from a government yard (council estate) in Kingston, and is now The Honourable Robert and on the cover of the phone book. It's impossible to underestimate the man's influence on the country at a time, soon after independence, when most Jamaicans were still trying to be white. For one thing, he gave a huge boost to Rastafarianism which has now seeped deep into Jamaican popular culture. </p> <p>But it's probably the Rastas, with their propensity to \"breed\" as many women as possible, who have given Jamaica a bad name when it comes to matters of sexual equality. In reality though, it's the women who run the place when it comes to one on one. </p> <p>Jamaicans appear to relish a bit of conflict in their sexual relations; in fact, they relish drama in general. One local shopowner had had all his stock thrown into the sea by an irate girlfriend. His mates sat on the beach below drinking the bottles of Red Stripe as they washed up to shore. </p> <p>Next day we hopped on Air Jamaica Express and flew across the island to Negril. Short-hop flights are actually by far the best way to get around in Jamaica, given that they're cheap and allow you to steer well clear of the roads, which are beset by pot holes and maniacal drivers. </p> <p>In Negril, there is no beach problem whatsoever. There's seven miles of it (or so they claim) - white sand and free to all. Although Negril has been notoriously developed in the past 20 years, the hotels have been secreted behind the trees and you can look all the way down the beach without seeing anything much apart from the little jerk chicken shacks and sun loungers put out by the beach-side restaurants. </p> <p>Negril is the place where you dance each night under the stars, bare feet in the sand, the moon on the milky sea. It is the most integrated, relaxed place I've been to in Jamaica but again suffers slightly from a bad reputation to do with pushy ganja sellers. But in reality the hassle is minimal, simply because Jamaicans are too cool to be good hasslers. </p> <p>Jamaican patois is a language extra seductive and tantalising because if you speak English you can soon get to half understand this poetic streetwise version of the mother tongue. It's not surprising that patois has become the lingua franca of rap music around the world. </p> <p>In fact, there's a generic conversational rap that Jamaicans expect. When I couldn't keep pace I was told, \"You don't got the lyrics, man.\" And lyrical it is. Perhaps that's why great songs have been Jamaica's most effective export. </p> <p>There is a ton of perfectly decent and reasonably-priced places to stay along the beach in Negril, and the best strategy is just to turn up and see what takes your fancy. </p> <p>The resort is divided between the beach and the West End. The latter is the cliff end; volcanic rocks plunge into clear aquamarine waters and the place is notorious for its fearless cliff divers and blood-red 180-degree sunsets. Traditionally you go to see these at Rick's \"World Famous\" Caf\u00e9 - but don't as they've turned it into a hellish mini theme park. </p> <p>And anyway, why would you when you can watch the sun sinking slowly into the sea, while floating on an airbed sipping a drink in The Rockhouse's stunning horizon pool? This hotel, owned and run by three laid-back Australians, is everything that's great about New York boutique-style hotels with none of the attendant attitude. </p> <p>Add a chill-out factor of less than zero and you'll find yourself arriving for a stylish Jamaican-fusion lunch in the thatched oceanside restaurant, staying for cocktails and checking in for a week. The rooms are chic but simple cottages: four posters, CD players, a shower open to the skies and your own private sun-deck. Plus they're remarkably good value. It's the kind of hotel you make friends in. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p> Air Tours (0870 2412567, <a href=\"http://www.airtours.co.uk\">www.airtours.co.uk</a> flies direct to Montego Bay from Gatwick on Wednesdays and Sundays and from Manchester on Mondays and Sundays.

In the day times, a short drive out of town, you can hang out on Reggae Beach - a \"Jamaican beach\", meaning the locals go there. Here you can swing under the sea-grape tree listening to music and drinking a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda - with not an all-inclusive in sight. The luxury option accommodation-wise is the Jamaica Inn. Old-world this is, but charming with it. The rooms are lovely, each with a patio the size of a large living room opening on to a turquoise sea, a pale gold beach or a lovely tropical garden. Once the preserve of the plantation set, the hotel has had to move with the times. Rich Jamaicans are to be seen in the dining room sporting Chanel handbags, and they serve a Jamaican breakfast: ackee (a kind of fruit that looks like scrambled eggs) and callaloo (spinach). But you can still play croquet on the lawn, and the waiters still wear white coats and carry breakfast trays on their heads. There are amusing day trips from Ocho Rios - if you're so inclined. There's a tour of Coward's hilltop pad, Firefly, which remains a rare unreconstructed tourist experience - you get the feeling you're having a clandestine look around someone's house while they've popped out for a moment; the table laid just as it was when Princess Margaret came to dinner, and, most touching of all, the old chap's battered saucepans hanging in the kitchenette. A statue of Coward sits looking out over the bay and his songs issue eternally from a small speaker hanging in a tree. At the other end of the musical spectrum, there's a trip to Bob Marley's birthplace, Nine Miles, situated in the hilly interior of the island. Here, Rastas show you round the musician's elaborate marble tomb. It's hard to go to Jamaica and not be imbued with Marley fever. This diminutive half-white lyrical genius came from a government yard (council estate) in Kingston, and is now The Honourable Robert and on the cover of the phone book. It's impossible to underestimate the man's influence on the country at a time, soon after independence, when most Jamaicans were still trying to be white. For one thing, he gave a huge boost to Rastafarianism which has now seeped deep into Jamaican popular culture. But it's probably the Rastas, with their propensity to \"breed\" as many women as possible, who have given Jamaica a bad name when it comes to matters of sexual equality. In reality though, it's the women who run the place when it comes to one on one. Jamaicans appear to relish a bit of conflict in their sexual relations; in fact, they relish drama in general. One local shopowner had had all his stock thrown into the sea by an irate girlfriend. His mates sat on the beach below drinking the bottles of Red Stripe as they washed up to shore. Next day we hopped on Air Jamaica Express and flew across the island to Negril. Short-hop flights are actually by far the best way to get around in Jamaica, given that they're cheap and allow you to steer well clear of the roads, which are beset by pot holes and maniacal drivers. In Negril, there is no beach problem whatsoever. There's seven miles of it (or so they claim) - white sand and free to all. Although Negril has been notoriously developed in the past 20 years, the hotels have been secreted behind the trees and you can look all the way down the beach without seeing anything much apart from the little jerk chicken shacks and sun loungers put out by the beach-side restaurants. Negril is the place where you dance each night under the stars, bare feet in the sand, the moon on the milky sea. It is the most integrated, relaxed place I've been to in Jamaica but again suffers slightly from a bad reputation to do with pushy ganja sellers. But in reality the hassle is minimal, simply because Jamaicans are too cool to be good hasslers. Jamaican patois is a language extra seductive and tantalising because if you speak English you can soon get to half understand this poetic streetwise version of the mother tongue. It's not surprising that patois has become the lingua franca of rap music around the world. In fact, there's a generic conversational rap that Jamaicans expect. When I couldn't keep pace I was told, \"You don't got the lyrics, man.\" And lyrical it is. Perhaps that's why great songs have been Jamaica's most effective export. There is a ton of perfectly decent and reasonably-priced places to stay along the beach in Negril, and the best strategy is just to turn up and see what takes your fancy. The resort is divided between the beach and the West End. The latter is the cliff end; volcanic rocks plunge into clear aquamarine waters and the place is notorious for its fearless cliff divers and blood-red 180-degree sunsets. Traditionally you go to see these at Rick's \"World Famous\" Caf\u00e9 - but don't as they've turned it into a hellish mini theme park. And anyway, why would you when you can watch the sun sinking slowly into the sea, while floating on an airbed sipping a drink in The Rockhouse's stunning horizon pool? This hotel, owned and run by three laid-back Australians, is everything that's great about New York boutique-style hotels with none of the attendant attitude. Add a chill-out factor of less than zero and you'll find yourself arriving for a stylish Jamaican-fusion lunch in the thatched oceanside restaurant, staying for cocktails and checking in for a week. The rooms are chic but simple cottages: four posters, CD players, a shower open to the skies and your own private sun-deck. Plus they're remarkably good value. It's the kind of hotel you make friends in.

I had done all the things you were supposed to do: school, university, proper grown-up job. I've ticked all the boxes, but like many people my age, all I'm left with is a feeling of 'is this it?'. It may well be that I decide the civil service is for me after all, but I have definitely decided that I don't want to live in London any longer. I'm fed up with urban life. I want to live by the sea or up in the mountains with clear air and beautiful views.\" (See week 8's report for more details.) </p> <p>He's even had time to dispense a few traveller's tips himself in response to readers' questions - who better to offer guidance on where to stay in San Francisco than someone who spent Christmas there? And if you're planning a trip to New Zealand, look no further - Sam's four-week stay on the other side of the world has seen him glacier trekking, kayaking, solo camping, cave tubing, bungee jumping and swimming with dolphins, and he's sent us photos of everything he's got up to. He's just arrived in Australia, and will be meeting up with fellow Netjetter Milly. You can read about their mutual experiences in their respective reports. </p> <p>Milly meanwhile has settled for a few weeks in Coogee, just outside Sydney. One unpleasant encounter aside (see week 4's report), the first few weeks of her trip left her exhilarated and delighted that her fears about travelling alone were proved groundless. To save money for the second leg of her trip, she's got a temporary job as a waitress in a large hotel, and although she's enjoying exploring Sydney and its environs, she's getting itchy feet. \"I've just read through Sue and Sam's reports,\" she writes in week 8's diary, \"and somehow I don't think mine are quite as exciting as theirs - but hey ho, I guess the reality of an 19-year-old travelling is that they run out of money pretty quickly.

I have now met three lots of people, in Bombay, Miri and Kuala Lumpur, who contacted me through the website, and there are several more lined up as I work my way round the world. I can't say I have had a single piece of duff advice. I would like to go everywhere that people suggest, but it's impossible to do it all.\" </p> <p>With only four weeks between winning the ticket and his departure date, Sam found the advice he's being sent particularly useful. \"I've been amazed at how helpful everyone has been and how keen people are to pass on really valuable information on places they have visited. Some of the most useful e-mails I've had have been on Africa. I know nothing about the region, and I didn't have time to do any research before I left England. I've had lots of excellent advice which is now helping me to plan a route. You'll have to wait and see how well this turns out...\" </p> <p>Sam is the only Netjetter who will be exploring Africa: on leaving Sydney he flies to Johannesburg, and then on to Namibia, Victoria Falls, Tanzania, Zanzibar and Nairobi. Sue's route will take her from Bali to Australia, then New Zealand, before crossing the Pacific to visit Buenos Aires, Santiago and Lima. Milly will be retracing Sue's footsteps - but in reverse. After Australia, she'll be travelling up through southeast Asia, visiting Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The best place to be at sunset is standing on top of the stout, black walls of Galle fort. Leaning over an embrasure on Moon bastion, I could see the entire old town within the promontory ramparts. </p> <p>Beyond the frangipani trees, the terracotta-tiled roofs and crumbling church porticoes was the Indian Ocean, a vast blue emptiness rolling away thousands of miles to Antarctica. To the north, the modern town of Galle was teeming like a disturbed ant hill. Beyond the main road and the honking bus station, past the brightly-coloured buildings and the proud facade of St Mary's Church was the jungle - a jade sea of palms broken only by the gleaming white point of a Buddhist temple. </p> <p>Lionel, a chatty old man with lips the colour of beetroot, reappeared by my side. We had met in the afternoon when I mistook him for a gem-shop tout and he asked if I was German. Waving a hand before me, like an umpire signalling a boundary, he indicated the large oval of turf immediately below us. Somehow, I had overlooked the cricket ground - where on Thursday England will do battle with Sri Lanka in the first Test. In the town, there was talk of little else. </p> <p>\"The Galle cauldron - a 20,000 seater stadium,\" Lionel announced. In size, the ground is more like a village green in Suffolk than an international arena and I looked at him quizzically. \"Ten thousand seats below,\" he rejoined. Then turning to look along the ramparts and grinning like a conjuror whose trick has worked, he added: \"Plus 10,000 seats up here. All free!\" </p> <p>It is extremely unlikely that the Dutch governor of Galle had cricket spectators in mind when, in 1667, he began re-fortifying the original Portuguese defences. He was more interested in keeping out the bellicose Sinhalese kings and protecting the profitable spice trade. In any event, he has provided the modern-day denizens of the town with the game's most wonderful natural stadium. \"It is marvellous,\" Lionel continued. \"We can sit here and watch the English get beat, at no cost.\" </p> <p>The fort walls may be the most obvious remnant of the European influence on Galle, but within them are a myriad of other references to colonial times. You can still find a fading inscription of the Dutch East India Company on the Old Gate leading down to the harbour, and on the other side, the British coat of arms. </p> <p>Streets still have their Dutch and British names - Leyn Baan Street, Queen Street and (British imagination in full flow) Middle Street. On Church Street, there is the grand Dutch Reformed Church and nearby, All Saints Church. Outside a grocery shop, the disembowelled chassis of an old Riley has been mounted as advertising. Another shop was called Daily Needs and sold \"Short Eats\". The shopkeeper said \"cheerio\". During the fleeting equatorial evening, kids play with sagging footballs and old women lean over their verandas to chat. I looked down Lighthouse Street and thought of an alleyway in the Barrio above Lisbon harbour. </p> <p>Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in Sri Lanka, you forget that the country is in the throes of a war that has ruined the north and turned Colombo into \"a Belfast in the sun,\" as I heard it described. The quiet, narrow streets of the Fort are laid out on an orderly grid and an unusual radiance graces the cracked, decaying plaster of the huddled buildings. </p> <p>The whole enclave feels remarkably un-Asian. Like Penang or Panjim, Galle Fort is a heterogeneous place and happy with it. There is even a Moorish quarter beneath the lighthouse. </p> <p>Such charm has recently prompted another invasion of sorts, this time of Europeans from the East. Jo Eden, a refugee from the high-finance fast lane, has bought and converted an old Muslim family house on Pedlar Street. \"When you think what you pay to rent property in Hong Kong, prices here are very, very cheap. It is the new Marrakech,\" she told me, sipping a cocktail in her courtyard. </p> <p>Others from the Asian towers have followed. Beyond the cricket ground, up the hill in the new town, is Galle's first bijou hotel, the Sun House. And perhaps more significantly, the New Oriental Hotel, the darling of travellers' accommodation since 1863, has just been sold. The Aman group, purveyors of haut-style from Indonesia are moving in. </p> <p>Galle, it seems, is going places again. I met Ameen, a suitably cosmopolitan gem and antique dealer, underneath a banyan tree on Hospital Street. \"It will be like the old days,\" he said with a wry smile. \"The Fort will be full of colonials.\" </p> <p>Back at the ramparts, on the grassy patch below Clippenberg bastion, every inch of ground was being used by quick-to-smile boys in a series of overlapping cricket matches. Once Jayantha knew I was English, there was no end to the cajoling until I picked up his bat. Clumsily, I scuffed a few balls away. Then, to peals of delight, the home-made palm stumps teetered and fell. \"Out! Out!\" Jayantha screamed, running round in delirious circles. \"England out!\" See you on the 22nd, I thought, in the Galle cauldron. </p> <p><strong> Accommodation </strong></p> <p>The <strong> Sun House</strong>, Galle (00 94-9 22624, or <a href=\"http://www.thesunhouse.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thesunhouse.com</a>) has beautifully decorated rooms from \u00a355 a night and great food. In the Fort, there are a number of small, clean guesthouses. The <strong> Old Dutch House</strong> (00 94-9 34370, \u00a35) is the most atmospheric but closed for refurbishment refurbished until March. The <strong> Rampart Hotel</strong> (00 94-74 380103, \u00a312 ) serves good food and has a great balcony where you can sit and have a beer overlooking the ramparts. Two kilometres out of Galle on the Matara Road, near the port is the <strong> Closenberg Hotel </strong> (00 94-9 32241, \u00a335). When the New Oriental Hotel closes for extensive refurbishment next month, this 19th-century villa overlooking the sea will be the best mid-range hotel near Galle. </p> <p>Many visitors stay on the beach, an endless line of sand and coconut palms, and make day visits to Galle. Head south east on the Matara Road where the beaches are less crowded than further north. Unawatuna is the most popular spot east of Galle and it can be busy. There are dozens of places to stay here. Here are three of the best, which should be booked in advance. The <strong> Dream House</strong> (00 94-74 381541/<a href=\"MAILTO:dreamhouse@libero.it\">dreamhouse@libero.it</a>, \u00a323) is owned by Italians, and the pasta makes a pleasant change from rice and curry. The <strong> Strand</strong> is an old colonial house (00 94-9 24358/ <a href=\"MAILTO:strand@sri.lanka.net\">strrand@sri.lanka.net</a>, \u00a310). The <strong> Secret Garden</strong> (00 94-71 614119) has four bedrooms and can be rented whole for \u00a3100 a night. A further 2km along the coast from Unawatuna, there are a few places to stay clustered around a swimming lagoon and a surf break. The <strong> Rockside </strong> guesthouse (00 94-9 83753, <a href=\"http://www.rocksideguesthouse.com\">www.rocksideguesthouse.com</a>, \u00a312) has three funky wooden cabanas right next to the beach. For good fresh fish, try the beach restaurant at Wijaya, next door, run by a gang of young Sri Lankan surfers. Some 35km past Galle is Mirissa, a perfect beach with safe swimming. The <strong> Bay Moon</strong> restaurant is a good place for lunch or a cold beer, with decent reggae. Families or groups may want to rent a whole house. Zaeem Hussain (00 94-77 900 907/zasha@applesri.lk) has 10 beachside properties along this coast from \u00a385 to \u00a3200 a night. </p> <p><strong> What to do </strong></p> <p>Plenty of places around Unawatuna offer scuba diving courses. Snorkelling and surf ing are also popular with no shortage of places to hire masks and boards. A good day trip away from the coast is to the Sinharaja rainforest - a beautiful place to walk. Alternatively, hire a bicycle and take off inland from anywhere on the coast. The jungle and the marshes are beautiful, full of wild birds. Adventure Sports Lanka (00 94-74 713334, <a href=\"http://www.adventureslanka.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.adventureslanka.com</a>) can organise great day trips mountain biking, canoeing, trekking and white water rafting on rivers in the hill country. </p> <p><strong> When to go </strong></p> <p>Galle and the south west coast fall within the distinct \"wet zone\" of Sri Lanka. The dry season here is supposed to be December to March, though in recent years the weather has been unpredictable. February is probably the best month. </p> <p><strong> How to get there </strong></p> <p>Srilankan Airlines (020-8538 2001) flies London Heathrow to Columbo for \u00a3612.10 return including tax. </p> <p><strong> Best reading </strong></p> <p>Sri Lanka Handbook published by Footprint, \u00a311.99. Reef, a novel by Romesh Gunusekera, published by Granta.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The best place to be at sunset is standing on top of the stout, black walls of Galle fort. Leaning over an embrasure on Moon bastion, I could see the entire old town within the promontory ramparts. Beyond the frangipani trees, the terracotta-tiled roofs and crumbling church porticoes was the Indian Ocean, a vast blue emptiness rolling away thousands of miles to Antarctica. To the north, the modern town of Galle was teeming like a disturbed ant hill. Beyond the main road and the honking bus station, past the brightly-coloured buildings and the proud facade of St Mary's Church was the jungle - a jade sea of palms broken only by the gleaming white point of a Buddhist temple. Lionel, a chatty old man with lips the colour of beetroot, reappeared by my side. We had met in the afternoon when I mistook him for a gem-shop tout and he asked if I was German. Waving a hand before me, like an umpire signalling a boundary, he indicated the large oval of turf immediately below us. Somehow, I had overlooked the cricket ground - where on Thursday England will do battle with Sri Lanka in the first Test. In the town, there was talk of little else. \"The Galle cauldron - a 20,000 seater stadium,\" Lionel announced. In size, the ground is more like a village green in Suffolk than an international arena and I looked at him quizzically. \"Ten thousand seats below,\" he rejoined. Then turning to look along the ramparts and grinning like a conjuror whose trick has worked, he added: \"Plus 10,000 seats up here. All free!\" It is extremely unlikely that the Dutch governor of Galle had cricket spectators in mind when, in 1667, he began re-fortifying the original Portuguese defences. He was more interested in keeping out the bellicose Sinhalese kings and protecting the profitable spice trade. In any event, he has provided the modern-day denizens of the town with the game's most wonderful natural stadium. \"It is marvellous,\" Lionel continued. \"We can sit here and watch the English get beat, at no cost.\" The fort walls may be the most obvious remnant of the European influence on Galle, but within them are a myriad of other references to colonial times. You can still find a fading inscription of the Dutch East India Company on the Old Gate leading down to the harbour, and on the other side, the British coat of arms. Streets still have their Dutch and British names - Leyn Baan Street, Queen Street and (British imagination in full flow) Middle Street. On Church Street, there is the grand Dutch Reformed Church and nearby, All Saints Church. Outside a grocery shop, the disembowelled chassis of an old Riley has been mounted as advertising. Another shop was called Daily Needs and sold \"Short Eats\". The shopkeeper said \"cheerio\". During the fleeting equatorial evening, kids play with sagging footballs and old women lean over their verandas to chat. I looked down Lighthouse Street and thought of an alleyway in the Barrio above Lisbon harbour. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in Sri Lanka, you forget that the country is in the throes of a war that has ruined the north and turned Colombo into \"a Belfast in the sun,\" as I heard it described. The quiet, narrow streets of the Fort are laid out on an orderly grid and an unusual radiance graces the cracked, decaying plaster of the huddled buildings. The whole enclave feels remarkably un-Asian. Like Penang or Panjim, Galle Fort is a heterogeneous place and happy with it. There is even a Moorish quarter beneath the lighthouse. Such charm has recently prompted another invasion of sorts, this time of Europeans from the East. Jo Eden, a refugee from the high-finance fast lane, has bought and converted an old Muslim family house on Pedlar Street. \"When you think what you pay to rent property in Hong Kong, prices here are very, very cheap. It is the new Marrakech,\" she told me, sipping a cocktail in her courtyard. Others from the Asian towers have followed. Beyond the cricket ground, up the hill in the new town, is Galle's first bijou hotel, the Sun House. And perhaps more significantly, the New Oriental Hotel, the darling of travellers' accommodation since 1863, has just been sold. The Aman group, purveyors of haut-style from Indonesia are moving in. Galle, it seems, is going places again. I met Ameen, a suitably cosmopolitan gem and antique dealer, underneath a banyan tree on Hospital Street. \"It will be like the old days,\" he said with a wry smile. \"The Fort will be full of colonials.\" Back at the ramparts, on the grassy patch below Clippenberg bastion, every inch of ground was being used by quick-to-smile boys in a series of overlapping cricket matches. Once Jayantha knew I was English, there was no end to the cajoling until I picked up his bat. Clumsily, I scuffed a few balls away. Then, to peals of delight, the home-made palm stumps teetered and fell. \"Out! Out!\" Jayantha screamed, running round in delirious circles. \"England out!\" See you on the 22nd, I thought, in the Galle cauldron. Accommodation The Sun House, Galle (00 94-9 22624, or www.thesunhouse.com) has beautifully decorated rooms from \u00a355 a night and great food. In the Fort, there are a number of small, clean guesthouses. The Old Dutch House (00 94-9 34370, \u00a35) is the most atmospheric but closed for refurbishment refurbished until March. The Rampart Hotel (00 94-74 380103, \u00a312 ) serves good food and has a great balcony where you can sit and have a beer overlooking the ramparts. Two kilometres out of Galle on the Matara Road, near the port is the Closenberg Hotel (00 94-9 32241, \u00a335). When the New Oriental Hotel closes for extensive refurbishment next month, this 19th-century villa overlooking the sea will be the best mid-range hotel near Galle. Many visitors stay on the beach, an endless line of sand and coconut palms, and make day visits to Galle. Head south east on the Matara Road where the beaches are less crowded than further north. Unawatuna is the most popular spot east of Galle and it can be busy. There are dozens of places to stay here. Here are three of the best, which should be booked in advance. The Dream House (00 94-74 381541/dreamhouse@libero.it, \u00a323) is owned by Italians, and the pasta makes a pleasant change from rice and curry. The Strand is an old colonial house (00 94-9 24358/ strrand@sri.lanka.net, \u00a310). The Secret Garden (00 94-71 614119) has four bedrooms and can be rented whole for \u00a3100 a night. A further 2km along the coast from Unawatuna, there are a few places to stay clustered around a swimming lagoon and a surf break. The Rockside guesthouse (00 94-9 83753, www.rocksideguesthouse.com, \u00a312) has three funky wooden cabanas right next to the beach. For good fresh fish, try the beach restaurant at Wijaya, next door, run by a gang of young Sri Lankan surfers. Some 35km past Galle is Mirissa, a perfect beach with safe swimming. The Bay Moon restaurant is a good place for lunch or a cold beer, with decent reggae. Families or groups may want to rent a whole house. Zaeem Hussain (00 94-77 900 907/zasha@applesri.lk) has 10 beachside properties along this coast from \u00a385 to \u00a3200 a night. What to do Plenty of places around Unawatuna offer scuba diving courses. Snorkelling and surf ing are also popular with no shortage of places to hire masks and boards. A good day trip away from the coast is to the Sinharaja rainforest - a beautiful place to walk. Alternatively, hire a bicycle and take off inland from anywhere on the coast. The jungle and the marshes are beautiful, full of wild birds. Adventure Sports Lanka (00 94-74 713334, www.adventureslanka.com) can organise great day trips mountain biking, canoeing, trekking and white water rafting on rivers in the hill country. When to go Galle and the south west coast fall within the distinct \"wet zone\" of Sri Lanka. The dry season here is supposed to be December to March, though in recent years the weather has been unpredictable. February is probably the best month. How to get there Srilankan Airlines (020-8538 2001) flies London Heathrow to Columbo for \u00a3612.10 return including tax. Best reading Sri Lanka Handbook published by Footprint, \u00a311.99.

      "body": "<p>I always find it ironic that <strong> bumps </strong> (also called \"moguls\") are detested by so many skiers; because bumps are created by skiers. In a sense, they represent skiing at its most natural. Back in the days before piste-bashers were invented, a slope would progress from being powder to becoming a mogulfield, and would stay that way until the next major snowfall. Nowadays, we pay ski resorts lots of money to groom their slopes regularly, and keep them bump-free. </p> <p>Bumps form because every skier gouges out a hollow in the snow with their edges when they turn. The snow that is gouged out is piled up just below the hollow. The next skier that comes along often finds it easiest to start his or her turn on top of the pile, and finish it in the hollow, thereby gouging out some more snow. </p> <p>The steeper the slope, the softer the snow; or the busier the piste, the quicker the bumps will form - and the deeper the troughs between them will get. If a run is soft, steep and busy enough, it can go from being groomed in the morning, to becoming a mogulfield by the end of the day. </p> <p>Skiers have two distinct attitudes towards bumps. Some just want to get down them as easily and effectively as possible. These types of skier will avoid bumps wherever possible, but sometimes they'll have to negotiate a mogulfield through necessity (for example, if it is on the way to or from some wonderful powder, or if they find themselves stuck on the wrong run). They will generally use long turns, linked by long traverses, to get through the bumps. </p> <p>The other type of skier treats the bumps as a challenge to his or her strength and prowess, and will attempt to negotiate the bumps using short turns down the fall line. This is called skiing the \" <strong> rut line </strong> \" or the \" <strong> zipper line </strong> \". This type of skier will often seek out \"exhibitionist\" mogul runs right beneath chairlifts. </p> <p>Using long turns through the bumps entails cutting up the side of a bump, starting your turn on the top of it by pivoting your skis, and finishing your turn as quickly as possible down the back side of the bump. As you traverse across the slope, trying to choose a bump on which to start your next turn, you'll need to watch out for the sharp bottom ends of the bumps, and plan your route to avoid them. When starting each turn on the top of a bump, use a <strong> pole-plant </strong> - it'll help start your pivoting. And as you go over the bump, tip your body forwards, because you're going from a tiny flat to a tiny steep, and you must keep your body at right angles to the slope. </p> <p>Good mogul skiers try to keep their skis on the snow as much as possible. They do this by \" <strong> absorbing </strong> \" the bumps; ie, bending their ankles, knees and waists as they go over the bump, and extending into the hollows. Ideally, the head should follow a level path, while the feet move up and down with the terrain. You can practise this while traversing across a mogulfield at first. </p> <p>The secret to turning in the bumps is to use this bending movement to initiate the turn. This is the opposite of what all intermediate skiers are taught to do: extend to start the turn. You need to learn to switch from \" <strong> up-unweighting </strong> \", ie extending, to \" <strong> down-unweighting </strong> \", ie bending, to start the turn. </p> <p>Skiing the \"zipper line\" requires you to ski from hollow to hollow, starting each turn on the little saddle between two bumps, and finishing it in the deepest part of the hollow. Your upper body must remain facing down the hill at all times, while just your feet and legs turn beneath you. A solid pole-plant will help set your rhythm and keep your upper body stable. But don't leave the pole in the ground for too long, otherwise it will drag your hand back and twist your upper body out of shape; just use a quick stab from the wrist, and then push your hand forward again. </p> <p>As you go over each saddle into the hollow, tip your body forward by pushing your ski tips down, so that you stay at right angles to the slope. Otherwise, you'll end up in the dreaded \"back seat\", and disaster will be imminent! </p> <p>In the zipper line, you're not trying to carve your turns; you need to pivot and skid to keep your speed under control, which is always problematic because of the narrowness of the troughs. You must look ahead, and whenever there's a bit more room between bumps, use it to throw in a hard skid to check your speed. </p> <p>Normally, I'm no great fan of skiers who keep their feet clamped together for the sake of some dubious \"style\". But specifically in moguls, a narrow stance is essential so that both feet encounter bumps and troughs simultaneously. If your feet are wide apart, one foot may be in a trough, while the other one is halfway up a bump. Once you start trying to do different things with both feet, it all gets too complicated. </p> <p>Bumps are physically demanding, even for those individuals who are adept at handling them. But the only way to improve your technique is to keep practising. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Bell is running ski courses for intermediate skiers this season in Vail &amp; Breckenridge, Colorado.

      "body": "<p><strong> Verdi centenary</strong></p> <p>The opera world is commemorating the 100th anniversary of the composer Giuseppe Verdi's death this year and all the major operators are singing about it. Lots of escorted holidays and breaks are planned combining his most dramatic performances with sightseeing tours. On March 1, Page &amp; Moy (0870 010 6457) is offering a four-night break to Vienna to see I Vespri Siciliani along with The Tales of Hoffman by Offenbach (\u00a3745). On May 31 a similar break includes tickets to Nabucco, plus Mozart's Don Giovanni (\u00a3765). Prices include tickets for two operas, two tours of Vienna, a one-day tour of the Burgenland, one evening meal and four nights, four-star B&amp;B accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Festive spirit</strong></p> <p>Just about every major opera house and European music festival appears in the programme from JMB (01905 425628). Take the Schubertiade Festival, which this year runs from June 13-25, and again from August 29-September 9, based in the Austrian village of Schwarzenberg. A three-night break with JMB in June, featuring three concerts and staying in the first-class Post Hotel in the neighbouring village of Besau, costs \u00a3552. </p> <p><strong> Different strokes</strong></p> <p>Martin Randall Travel (020-8742 3355) offers two tempting tours this spring (among many others) both based in Italy. The first (March 2-6) is based in San Gimignano, Italy's best preserved medieval city, exploring not only its beautiful streets, churches and public buildings but also taking excursions to other Tuscan hilltop towns, such as Siena, Volterra, Monteriggioni and Certaldo. The tour is led by art historian Antonia Whitley and costs \u00a3820 inclusive of almost everything, including drinks, wine and coffee. </p> <p>From March 6-11, you could be based in Mantua in north-east Italy, looking at the fortresses, castles and cathedrals of the area. Simply Mantua spends two days in the town, but also goes to the other great Renaissance centres such as Ferrara, Parma, Sabbioneta and to the pretty moated castle town of Fontenellato where excellent frescoes by Parmigianino have been recently restored. (\u00a3920 all-inclusive). </p> <p>If there's one city that encapsulates thousands of years of cultural history and incomparable art and architectural riches, it's Rome. It may be a tall order, especially if you're pushed for time, but Andante Travels (01722 713800) still believes that the Italian capital should be approached slowly, and on foot. Its six-day Rome, Tivoli and Ostia trip is led by an archaeologist Dr Robert Leighton and spends two half-days introducing the city centre to guests, with plenty of free time to wander at will. Tivoli and Ostia are chosen to complement the city as idyllic rural contrasts, both painting a clearer picture of how the Empire was run. The tour costs \u00a3850, departing October 1. The Etruscans - Romantic Ruins in Rural Italy is a five-day holiday from September 26, which besides picking over various ancient sites will visit the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome (price: \u00a3835). </p> <p><strong> Stepping out</strong></p> <p>Travel for the Arts (020-7483 4466) can offer tailor-made breaks with ballet tickets included worldwide, whether in Budapest, Milan, Barcelona, Chicago, Munich or New York. Ready-made packages are the easier option. A three-night trip to Paris to see the San Francisco ballet perform Othello from May 18-20, for example, costs \u00a3515 including return travel on Eurostar, three-star hotel accommodation and top category tickets for both the ballet and Faust opera on the Saturday night. </p> <p><strong> Manhattan transfer</strong></p> <p>Visit New York's Metropolitan, one of the world's most prestigious opera houses. The high notes in this spring's programme include Nabucco and Il Trovatore, both by Verdi. Tickets to both can be combined with a seven-night holiday with Page &amp; Moy (0870 010 6457) in March, plus a visit to the Frick Collection, the Museum of Modern Art and the Pierpoint Morgan Library. Cost: \u00a31,299 B&amp;B based on two sharing at the Mayflower Hotel, a few minutes' walk from the Lincoln Center. </p> <p>The company can also arrange for you to stay in a Manhattan apartment as a paying guest. It's certainly cheaper and perfectly reliable as all apartments have been personally vetted. </p> <p><strong> Further afield</strong></p> <p>As the travelling world shrinks, the choice of culturally-rich weekends grows ever bigger. Sri Lanka, Jordan, Dubai, Libya, Lebanon, Istanbul, St Petersburg and Marrakech all feature alongside the more traditional Paris, Amsterdam and Venice packages in Prospect's Cultural Breaks Worldwide programme (020-7486 5705). The only problem is choosing which - each place is stuffed with galleries, drama, ancient wonders and natural beauty. Consider Cairo if you fancy five days witnessing the splendours of the Pharaohs. The tour costs \u00a3650, departs on Mar 29 and May 10 and stays at the Mena House Oberoi, sitting in 40 acres of jasmine-scented gardens overlooking the Great Pyramid in Cairo. </p> <p><strong> In the line of fire</strong></p> <p>It's a Long Way to Tipperary, but then that's not where the tour of that name is destined. It is actually a perfect introduction to the first world war for first-time travellers with Holts Tours (01304 612248), and takes in Ypres, Vimy Ridge and The Somme. Holts, which specialises in battlefield tours, describes this package as explaining the reasons for and the conduct of the conflict. It can even incorporate visits to individual graves on request. The price, \u00a3379, includes three nights' half-board with wine in three-star hotels, two expert guides, and all ferries and coaches. </p> <p>Battlefield breaks may not be the most relaxing in the world but they're proving very popular. Holts now runs tours covering Vietnam, the American Civil War, medieval Paris, and Pearl Harbour. </p> <p><strong> Get an Eiffel</strong></p> <p>What does the keeper of medieval and later antiquities in the British Museum do once he's retired? Move to Paris, begin teaching, and lead fascinating tours of Gothic Paris for holidaymakers with The British Museum Traveller (020-7436 7575). A three-day guided break, with Notre Dame the obvious highlight, costs \u00a3385 from April 6, including Eurostar return tickets and half board. If you prefer to take the train to Brussels, join the company's Flemish Art and Architecture break based in Bruges and Ghent, which lasts four days from May 3 and costs \u00a3690. </p> <p><strong> Time travel</strong></p> <p>Everyone's an archaeologist at heart, declares Philip Ragg, leader of Footprints, who runs two three-day tours in Scotland on a weekly basis, giving an academic but accessible approach to tracing your roots. One is a loop from Edinburgh spending three days on the east coast; the other from Glasgow in the west. Treat a tour as a field trip, travelling through 5,000 years, beginning at neolithic and bronze-age sites and moving on to iron-age hillforts and culminating with castles. Ragg paints pictures and draws narratives along the way. Three days cost \u00a3360 including all travel and two nights' hotel accommodation (all meals\u00a320 extra). Further details: 01683-221592 or <a href=\"http://www.footprintsscotland.co.uk\">www.footprintsscotland.co.uk</a>. </p> <p><strong> Moor the merrier</strong></p> <p>The city of El Cid, Moorish palaces, the Serranos Towers and a glorious cathedral, Valencia now bills itself as Spain's City of Arts and Sciences. The latest addition to the skyline is the new Science Museum, which opened last November to a spectacular backdrop of fireworks, dance and fiesta. You will be forgiven for thinking a giant white animal skeleton has dropped by, as all the exhibitions and touchy-feely displays are housed within four sides of glass walls joined by a spiny structure of pointed arches. A short break will leave plenty of time for the eye-shaped IMAX theatre, planetarium and laserdrome before getting down to the more serious Spanish business of eating and drinking. Travelscene (020-8424 9648) is offering three nights B&amp;B for the price of two (\u00a3241) until the end of March. </p> <p><strong> Taste of Turin</strong></p> <p>If you've done Venice, Florence, Milan and Rome, it's time to turn to Turin. The former capital of Italy comes as a constant surprise to visitors. Elected one of the European Cities of Culture for 2001, Turin is an ancient city of Baroque elegance, far more than a base for Fiat, Cinzano and Ferrero. </p> <p>The Egyptian Museum houses arguably the greatest collection of artefacts outside of Cairo, positively heaving with statues, scrolls and mummies. Next door is another renowned masterpiece, the Palazzo Carignano, which house an exhibition tracing the history of the Risorgimento, Italy's movement towards unity, and is one of six royal palaces and castles worth a detour. </p> <p>Also spare time for the new National Museum of Cinema, housed in the Mole Antonelliana, which was built in 1863 as a Jewish temple. And when your legs can take no more, rest up in one of the town's famous coffee shops, more familiarly known as \"the living rooms of Turin\". Hop over with The Magic of Italy (020-8939 5453) whose breaks start at \u00a3311 for three nights' B&amp;B (\u00a3296 after December 14). </p> <p><strong> Basque country</strong><br> </p> <p>What the Burrell did for Glasgow, Frank Gehry has done for Bilbao in northern Spain with the achingly modern structure that is the Guggenheim, his stunning showcase of art on the banks of the Nervion. Follow the floor plan and you'll be guided through an encyclopaedia of 20th-century European and American masterpieces. The $100m centre has kick-started tourism to the Basque region. Given a weekend, spend half a day there before moving on to the Goyas and El Grecos in the Bellas Artes gallery, and the Basque museum, which helps decipher the ancient culture. All breaks to Bilbao with city specialist Kirker Holidays (020-7231 3333) include an entrance ticket to the Guggenheim (although remember that it is closed on Mondays).

And very nearly pointless\". The same, alas, might be said for this book, Shields's first attempt at biography. Unless, that is, you want to make a case for there being a giddy sort of charm in her literary criticism: there is \"no mention of toes in any of [Jane Austen's] work, though there are a few fingers. Nor are there any hips, thighs, shins, buttocks, kidneys, intestines, wombs or navels.\" </p> <p>Shields is an award-winning novelist, and she approaches Jane Austen as one writer to another. She identifies with the agonising wait to hear from publishers and with the pain of being told by a squirming reader that your new book is \"extremely interesting\". However, it is rather the contrast than the comparisons between the cool, nimble 19th-century novelist and her lumpen biographer that strikes one. For all their bonding, Shields seems ill-equipped to write a life of Jane Austen; she gives us instead a garrulous essay in which empathy replaces thought, speculation replaces substance and repetition tries to replace research. The finished product is a baffling confusion of contradictions and random ideas. </p> <p>Literary biography, Shields argues, should \"throw light on a writer's works, rather than combing the works to recreate the author\". This moot point, casually made at the end of the book, bears no relation to what the reader has just been struggling with. Not having anything new to say about Jane Austen - Claire Tomalin and David Nokes having both published rather fine biographies recently - Shields opts instead to compare the novels thematically with the events and characters in Jane Austen's life. This process of weighing and measuring is occasionally interrupted as Shields reminds us that, actually, Austen wasn't an autobiographical writer at all. </p> <p>For example, not only do her \"heroines live in fictional places\", but there can nowhere be found in any of the novels the story of her sister Cassandra's fianc\u00e9 dying of yellow fever, or of her aunt's being imprisoned for stealing a piece of lace. Good point, so why do we then have so many \"analyses\" along the lines of \"Elinor and Marianne [are] like the Austen sisters, without money and each of them longing for marriage\"? Or \"in Jane Austen's novels daughters grow up and very often become their parents' advisers. In her own family this did not happen\"? Even the absence of \"a great deal of love for children in Jane Austen's work\" is reduced to the author's being \"often saddled with the care of her nephews and nieces\". </p> <p>The only remarkable achievement of Shields's book is to make Jane Austen's imaginative powers seem as inert and limited as her domestic life, and the novels seem smaller than they once were. Nowhere is there presented a plausible case for seeing life and literature as mirroring one another in so straight- forward a way. Mirroring often distorts rather than reflects, and it is striking to find an accomplished novelist being so unquestioning about the relationship between the self one is and the self who writes. </p> <p>Henry James dramatised this tension perfectly in his story \"The Private Life\", in which a celebrated writer (based on the poet Robert Browning) is busy boring his friends over dinner while his ghost is sitting upstairs, producing page after page of animated drama. The point is that these selves do not meet - that the part of us that writes is strange to us and a stranger to others. </p> <p>Unfortunately, on this occasion we seem to be stuck at a dinner party with the Carol Shields who writes biography rather than the skilled novelist, who is scribbling away elsewhere. As with any dull guest, opinion is presented as fact - \"It is difficult to love Darcy\" - and the banal is presented as perceptive: \"Death, particularly the death of her father, must have affected her deeply.\" </p> <p>Perhaps aware that her audience is jaded rather than enlivened, Shields throws in a few clich\u00e9d metaphors: \"Just as [Jane Austen] walked behind a wall of shrubbery at Steventon, she wrote her novels behind a wall of isolation.\" During this period her brothers were engaged in combat at sea, while she, at home, \"pen in hand, brought to the page the only kind of combat a woman was allowed: the conquest of hearts\". </p> <p>By the time we get to her knowledge of Jane Austen's Bath, Shields seems to have become tipsy: \"Today Mrs Thatcher comes here to relax; the Clintons have dropped in, and so have a number of film stars, Elizabeth Taylor and Demi Moore; there is no doubt that name- dropping was, and continues to be, part of fabled Bath.\" At the dinner party, one imagines, Shields's companions nervously clear their throats.</p>",

What makes finding a holiday online so very engaging is the sheer range of possibilities and the excitement of planning what you want to do, and how you want to do it. </p> <p>Ever since Thomas Cook's shilling-fare railway excursions to Liverpool in the 1840s, the job of the travel agent has been to bundle up a return journey, a hotel and a couple of guided tours in one agreeable, cheap package. The package era is not quite over yet, but it no longer represents the leap into the unknown that it once did. If the 10-word description of a Bangkok hotel leaves you slightly incredulous, you don't need to pore over guidebooks in Waterstone's. Type it into <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">www.google.com</a> instead and you'll probably find a few photographs, the odd review and the e-mail address. And that sets you thinking. There's got to be a better hotel out there - and, hang on, isn't the airfare a bit steep? Do you really need that transfer and the services of a tour rep? </p> <p>Soon you've bookmarked a picture of the Bangkok skyline at night (<a href=\"http://www.tat.or.th/province/central/bangkok/\">www.tat.or.th/province/central/bangkok/</a>) and you're looking at it every morning, just counting the days until the flight. The hotel owner's English is pretty bad, judging from his e-mails, but you've got his assurance in writing that the room has a view and a shower. And a friend of a friend is working in the city. You've e-mailed her and arranged to meet up. </p> <p>In case you're about to sniff and protest that you're not in the market for trips to the Far East - hell, you can't even afford a guidebook - here's another scenario. You managed to find a cheap tent online in the January sales, and want to do some walking in the Brecon Beacons. Save money by travelling by coach rather than train (<a href=\"http://www.gobycoach.com\">www.gobycoach.com</a>), plan the itinerary at the Brecon Beacons Mountain Hut (<a href=\"http://www.brecon-beacons.com/hutindex.shtml\">www.brecon-beacons.com/hutindex.shtml</a>) and then go to (<a href=\"http://www.tourism.wales.gov.uk/cgi/acc_camping.pl\">www.tourism.wales.gov.uk/cgi/acc_camping.pl</a> ) to find a campsite. </p> <p>Suddenly, lastminute.com's \u00a315.3m losses in the last quarter seem irrelevant. Is the beleaguered start-up on my list? No: the joint venture they announced with Thomas Cook this week was a clever move. It's a deal that, if their cash runs out, should enable them to tumble into the firm embrace of the world's oldest travel agent. The problem with doing something at the last minute is that you're substituting cash for time and imagination. It's not a philosophy most travellers would share.</p>",

If the 10-word description of a Bangkok hotel leaves you slightly incredulous, you don't need to pore over guidebooks in Waterstone's. Type it into www.google.com instead and you'll probably find a few photographs, the odd review and the e-mail address. And that sets you thinking. There's got to be a better hotel out there - and, hang on, isn't the airfare a bit steep? Do you really need that transfer and the services of a tour rep? Soon you've bookmarked a picture of the Bangkok skyline at night (www.tat.or.th/province/central/bangkok/) and you're looking at it every morning, just counting the days until the flight. The hotel owner's English is pretty bad, judging from his e-mails, but you've got his assurance in writing that the room has a view and a shower. And a friend of a friend is working in the city. You've e-mailed her and arranged to meet up. In case you're about to sniff and protest that you're not in the market for trips to the Far East - hell, you can't even afford a guidebook - here's another scenario. You managed to find a cheap tent online in the January sales, and want to do some walking in the Brecon Beacons. Save money by travelling by coach rather than train (www.gobycoach.com), plan the itinerary at the Brecon Beacons Mountain Hut (www.brecon-beacons.com/hutindex.shtml) and then go to (www.tourism.wales.gov.uk/cgi/acc_camping.pl ) to find a campsite. Suddenly, lastminute.com's \u00a315.3m losses in the last quarter seem irrelevant. Is the beleaguered start-up on my list? No: the joint venture they announced with Thomas Cook this week was a clever move. It's a deal that, if their cash runs out, should enable them to tumble into the firm embrace of the world's oldest travel agent. The problem with doing something at the last minute is that you're substituting cash for time and imagination. It's not a philosophy most travellers would share.",

Mr Blunkett recognises that the future of comprehensive schools needs sensitive handling with party activists. He received a delegation from anxious Labour MPs on Tuesday, many of them upset at the dismissal of \"bog standard comprehensives\" by the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell. Mr Blunkett said yesterday: \"I do not use or recognise such a term.\" He went on to attack one of his critics, Lord Hattersley, the former Labour deputy leader, saying that \"failed elder statesmen had a responsibility to restrain their self-indulgence and think about how we improve education for most people\". He asked how his critics could claim that he was creating greater division in society by extending the number of specialist schools from a sixth of all secondary schools to half. He said that his critics from both the left and the right were in danger of creating a vicious cycle of disillusionment in which no government would be given any credit for any progress. He warned: \"This cynicism leads to a collapse in faith in community, family and public life. If we are not very careful we will end up with a demoralised nation that believes nothing can change and will change.\" He argued that Labour had achieved far more than it had ever promised at the 1997 election, including record falls in unemployment, a collapse in inflation and record low interest rates. He added: \"Two years ago people said that if unemployment had fallen below 1m inflation would have gone through the roof.\" He said none of this had happened by accident, and the good economic conditions had now created a platform for radical change in the second term. Mr Blunkett added that Labour was working towards a new welfare state of empowerment, and he cited his own experience of being brought up blind on a council estate, suffering the loss of his father at the age of 12. Early returns showed 80% of people in employment zones were finding long-term jobs. Shaun Woodward, the former Conservative MP who defected to Labour, will make his first big appearance at a Labour conference today, condemning the Tory party under William Hague as \"uncaring, greedy, and driven by individualism\".",

      "body": "<p>My friend, the MP David Lammy, frequently tells the story of how he was rescued from the fate of many lively black boys in Tottenham (jail or worse) by a succession of outstandingly committed - and impeccably leftwing - teachers in state schools. But to gain his higher qualifications, and to pursue his talent for music, he was forced to leave Tottenham, encouraged by some of those very teachers. </p> <p>His predecessor, Bernie Grant, sent his own children to local schools. He rightly pointed out that whatever the virtue of the comprehensive school as an ideal, and however committed teachers and governors were, the system overall was not producing equality for the poorest in Britain's inner cities. </p> <p>And he struck a chord with black and poor parents locally (I was one at the time) when he reflected that the middle classes could afford to take a principled stand against selection, or attack church schools; their children went to schools in affluent postcodes where they could be sure of getting five or six GCSEs and then three A-levels. The sort of people he represented were glad to get through a year without their child being excluded. </p> <p>I grew up in Tottenham's neighbouring district, Wood Green, which at the time was even less salubrious. My background was typical. I didn't see an inside toilet until I was almost seven, my house did not have a telephone until I was well into my teens, no member of my family possessed a car until my sister married someone who did. Our legal career horizons were limited to jobs where you wore a uniform - the Post Office (like my dad), British Rail, the Barratts factory down the road. Being a boy, nursing wasn't open to me, and being black, the thought of becoming a copper wasn't even good for a laugh. </p> <p>Like most inner-city boys who were never going to be professional boxers or athletes, there was only one way out: school. I attended a local primary. I was triply lucky. I was able to do the sort of memory tests that passed for learning in those days. Then I met at least one teacher who took a special interest in me and, unusually, encouraged me not to focus my energy on the sports field, but on the library. Also, I had parents who were fanatically preoccupied with academic success - neither of them wanted us to live their lives over again. As a result I passed my 11-plus a year early and won a place at the local grammar school - which promptly went comprehensive. </p> <p>As with many, my luck did not survive the transition to secondary school. We know from recent studies that some children - minority children especially - can enter school at five years old well ahead of their peers and leave 20 points behind on the scales of achievement. There was nothing special about my situation. Few children succeeded. The same school today has a record of achievement that would make the most passionate supporter of the comprehensive ideal blush with shame. </p> <p>My parents were both determined and decisive. They dragged me out of a comprehensive school in London at the age of 13 and packed me off to the ancestral home - a fishing village some 5,000 miles away. There I went to an old fashioned state school, which eventually sent me back to Imperial College, the most prestigious university for science and engineering in western Europe. </p> <p>All of this may help to explain why I support with passion the reforms proposed by David Blunkett earlier this week. I am not a slavish supporter of what he has done at the DfEE. I recognise the need for central government to enforce increased standards, but I worry about the tendency to centralise all educational policy. I abhor the devaluation of teachers' status and conditions; the government has begun to remedy that but I would like to see even more cash find its way into teachers' pockets. In London, one of things that unites me and the mayor is a determination to see action to bring down the cost of living in the city for teachers. </p> <p>But Mr Blunkett's plans for specialist schools, and his encouragement of diversity in the governance of schools, is a masterstroke. The critics are making a fundamental error in labelling this the start of a two-tier system. They mistakenly believe that the only way to construct a comprehensive system is through a series of \"comprehensive\" institutions. </p> <p>The problem is that these schools have never truly been comprehensive; no single school can be. No single school - even a well-endowed public school - can offer a total range of subjects or kinds of teaching. No single school will have an intake that is a true reflection of the range of local people - the middle class flight to the suburbs ensures that. And no single school can ensure an equal opportunity for children of all backgrounds and abilities. We can no more expect comprehensivisation in one school than we could have hoped for socialism in one country. We cannot expect teachers to do the impossible. </p> <p>The plans for a diverse range of specialist schools at least offers a clear acceptance that it is the system overall that must offer diversity to students and parents.

We faced up to each other as weary shoppers tramped by. I was aware of Glenn's testosterone pumping through his teenage body. \"I will not have you questioning my calculations,\" I roared, and Glenn stormed off with his tail between his legs. I eventually caught up with him in Bathrooms, where he was standing in a shower stall, sullenly examining the fixtures.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you're starting out in your career, newly-suited, recruited and full of enthusiasm, promotion seems a certainty. If not immediately, then in a year or so. Sadly, that's not always the case - hundreds of eager graduates have discovered it's possible to move sideways, down or even out. </p> <p> Getting promoted is a tricky business and it's amazing how easy it is to get it wrong, even with the best intentions. Here's the definitive guide to what <strong> not</strong> to do if you want to inch (sorry Brussels, centimetre) your way up the corporate ladder... </p> <p> <strong> Don't work too hard</strong> </p> <p> You heard right. You may think that working late every night may make you appear keen and dedicated, but it can be counterproductive. British employees already work the longest hours in Europe and stress- related illness is on the increase. So, what are you trying to prove? \"If you continually work late nights and weekends you'll end up burning yourself out,\" says Cary Cooper, Bupa professor of organisational psychology and </p> <p>health at UMIST. \"What's more, your bosses might start to question why it takes you so long and so much effort to do your job. Work smarter, not longer. Put quality before quantity.\" </p> <p> <strong> Don't be an autocrat</strong> </p> <p> According to Rosemary Nodder, chartered occupational psychologist and senior lecturer at Hatfield University, companies no longer want autocratic leaders. \"They want charismatic democrats, people who are supportive, able to lead by listening and giving feedback. Nowadays, the keyword is 'diversity awareness', the ability to accept and work with difference.\" </p> <p> <strong> Don't hide your light under a bushel</strong> </p> <p> Got a compliment from a client? Don't keep it to yourself - you may be British but the corporate world is no place for modesty. Instead, tell your boss about your successes - or make sure he/she finds out on the grapevine. Say \"Mr X just called to say he really enjoyed the seminar I put on\". (You can keep his negative comments about the catering/decor/ your boss to yourself.) </p> <p> <strong> Don't put anyone down</strong> </p> <p> That includes the receptionist, secretary, catering staff and office junior - word spreads. \"Put someone down and it will come back to haunt you later in your career,\" says Cary Cooper. \"You never know when you'll come across them again - and next time they might be in a position to damage you. Instead, be kind, friendly and helpful to everyone.\" </p> <p> <strong> But don't be too helpful</strong> </p> <p> Using your technical skills to help fix the computer systems/photocopier is admirable, as is offering to make the coffee, taking a feverish colleague to the sick room or offering to check the new boy's spelling. But be too generous and your own job will suffer. If you want to progress, self-interest comes first. If you like making coffee, get a job at Starbucks. </p> <p> <strong> Don't go to meetings</strong> </p> <p> At least, not all of them. As you've probably figured out by now, most meetings are a waste of time (unless you need a chance to catch up on some sleep or practise your doodles). \"If you spread yourself too thinly, you won't get your job done,\" explains Cary Cooper. \"Choose your meetings carefully and make useful contributions, so your presence is felt.\" </p> <p> <strong> Don't be too ambitious</strong> </p> <p> Enthusiasm is never a vice, but setting goals which you can't achieve is just plain stupid. Your boss will only notice your failings - not your successes. If you want to fulfil your ambitions, take every opportunity you can to learn new skills by enrolling on training courses and finding a mentor. </p> <p> <strong> But don't rest on your laurels</strong> </p> <p> However positive your appraisal, however much your boss believes the sun shines out of you, be prepared for an inevitable eclipse. Competitive colleagues, new technology or market developments mean you can't afford to stand still. \"Use your performance appraisal to help plan your career, year by year,\" suggests Cary Cooper. </p> <p> <strong> Never turn down the chance to network</strong> </p> <p> Most jobs offer perks not offered on your contract - after-work team drinks, client functions, meals out at expensive restaurants. The idea is not to eat and drink yourself silly, but to build relationships and trade information. \"Pick and choose the social situations that will help your career progress and try to enjoy yourself - don't see it as a duty,\" says Cary Cooper. \"But don't suck up to anyone. And make sure you have a life - friends, relationships, hobbies - outside work.\" </p> <p> <strong> Don't be yourself</strong> </p> <p> \"Be who they want you to be,\" says Rosemary Nodder. \"Doing a good job isn't enough, you have to play the office politics game. That means wearing the right clothes, associating with the right people and being seen to get your work done. Don't hide yourself away in a small sub-office. Engineer it so you move around the organisation and get your face known.\" </p> <p> <strong> But don't pretend to be someone else</strong> </p> <p> Most people can smell sycophants or devious politicians a mile off. If you don't agree with what your boss has suggested, give clear honest feedback even if it's negative. However good an actor you are, you won't be able to sustain a role forever (unless you're Sean Connery). </p> <p><strong> If you don't remember anything else... </strong></p> <p>Never be negative. Both Rosemary Nodder and Cary Cooper say the most important rule is to be open to anything. \"Never be a 'why you can't do that' person,\" states Cary Cooper. \"Don't resist change; embrace it. Think how you can make change and new innovations work for you. Be a living suggestion box.\" </p> <p>And avoid associating with negative people - their reputation will rub off on you. Oh, and don't rely on lists to help you gain promotion. </p> <p> The gap year after A levels is almost a rite of passage and taking a year out after university to travel around the world has become so common that it's almost pass\u00e9. But what about taking a year out during your degree? </p> <p>Some students don't find the transition from A levels to degree studies easy. After a year or two at university they yearn to get out into the world either to gain some work experience or travel - and they don't want to wait until they graduate. </p> <p> But how common is it for students to interrupt their studies? \"I haven't come across it often,\" says Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters. \"However, when it does happen the most common reasons for doing so are because of illness or financial problems.\" A recent survey by the Mental Health Foundation showed that 50% of university students showed signs of clinical anxiety and more than one in 10 suffered from clinical depression. </p> <p>However, he says that if undergraduates decide to take a year out during their degree, it's important that they don't do it on a whim. \"As with any career decision you need to weigh up the pros and cons. If you do take a year out you need to be able to explain why to prospective employers. It may surprise some, but if you have done something constructive, you can present a year out in a positive light.\" </p> <p>Carl does warn that one of the dangers of taking a year out is that some undergraduates are reluctant to return and complete their degree, particularly if they have spent their year out working. </p> <p> Not so with Matthew Bright who took a year out while studying for an anthropology degree at one of the universities in London. \"I went straight from A levels to university but I made a mistake when I picked my first degree subject, physics. I was accepted through clearing and perhaps if I hadn't I may have had time to think about what I really wanted to do.\" </p> <p>After his first year, Matthew realised that physics was not for him and quit because of financial problems.

      "bodyText": "If you're starting out in your career, newly-suited, recruited and full of enthusiasm, promotion seems a certainty. If not immediately, then in a year or so. Sadly, that's not always the case - hundreds of eager graduates have discovered it's possible to move sideways, down or even out. Getting promoted is a tricky business and it's amazing how easy it is to get it wrong, even with the best intentions. Here's the definitive guide to what not to do if you want to inch (sorry Brussels, centimetre) your way up the corporate ladder... Don't work too hard You heard right. You may think that working late every night may make you appear keen and dedicated, but it can be counterproductive. British employees already work the longest hours in Europe and stress- related illness is on the increase. So, what are you trying to prove? \"If you continually work late nights and weekends you'll end up burning yourself out,\" says Cary Cooper, Bupa professor of organisational psychology and health at UMIST. \"What's more, your bosses might start to question why it takes you so long and so much effort to do your job. Work smarter, not longer. Put quality before quantity.\" Don't be an autocrat According to Rosemary Nodder, chartered occupational psychologist and senior lecturer at Hatfield University, companies no longer want autocratic leaders. \"They want charismatic democrats, people who are supportive, able to lead by listening and giving feedback. Nowadays, the keyword is 'diversity awareness', the ability to accept and work with difference.\" Don't hide your light under a bushel Got a compliment from a client? Don't keep it to yourself - you may be British but the corporate world is no place for modesty. Instead, tell your boss about your successes - or make sure he/she finds out on the grapevine. Say \"Mr X just called to say he really enjoyed the seminar I put on\". (You can keep his negative comments about the catering/decor/ your boss to yourself.) Don't put anyone down That includes the receptionist, secretary, catering staff and office junior - word spreads. \"Put someone down and it will come back to haunt you later in your career,\" says Cary Cooper. \"You never know when you'll come across them again - and next time they might be in a position to damage you. Instead, be kind, friendly and helpful to everyone.\" But don't be too helpful Using your technical skills to help fix the computer systems/photocopier is admirable, as is offering to make the coffee, taking a feverish colleague to the sick room or offering to check the new boy's spelling. But be too generous and your own job will suffer. If you want to progress, self-interest comes first. If you like making coffee, get a job at Starbucks. Don't go to meetings At least, not all of them. As you've probably figured out by now, most meetings are a waste of time (unless you need a chance to catch up on some sleep or practise your doodles). \"If you spread yourself too thinly, you won't get your job done,\" explains Cary Cooper. \"Choose your meetings carefully and make useful contributions, so your presence is felt.\" Don't be too ambitious Enthusiasm is never a vice, but setting goals which you can't achieve is just plain stupid. Your boss will only notice your failings - not your successes. If you want to fulfil your ambitions, take every opportunity you can to learn new skills by enrolling on training courses and finding a mentor. But don't rest on your laurels However positive your appraisal, however much your boss believes the sun shines out of you, be prepared for an inevitable eclipse. Competitive colleagues, new technology or market developments mean you can't afford to stand still. \"Use your performance appraisal to help plan your career, year by year,\" suggests Cary Cooper. Never turn down the chance to network Most jobs offer perks not offered on your contract - after-work team drinks, client functions, meals out at expensive restaurants. The idea is not to eat and drink yourself silly, but to build relationships and trade information. \"Pick and choose the social situations that will help your career progress and try to enjoy yourself - don't see it as a duty,\" says Cary Cooper. \"But don't suck up to anyone. And make sure you have a life - friends, relationships, hobbies - outside work.\" Don't be yourself \"Be who they want you to be,\" says Rosemary Nodder. \"Doing a good job isn't enough, you have to play the office politics game. That means wearing the right clothes, associating with the right people and being seen to get your work done. Don't hide yourself away in a small sub-office. Engineer it so you move around the organisation and get your face known.\" But don't pretend to be someone else Most people can smell sycophants or devious politicians a mile off. If you don't agree with what your boss has suggested, give clear honest feedback even if it's negative. However good an actor you are, you won't be able to sustain a role forever (unless you're Sean Connery). If you don't remember anything else... Never be negative. Both Rosemary Nodder and Cary Cooper say the most important rule is to be open to anything. \"Never be a 'why you can't do that' person,\" states Cary Cooper. \"Don't resist change; embrace it. Think how you can make change and new innovations work for you. Be a living suggestion box.\" And avoid associating with negative people - their reputation will rub off on you. Oh, and don't rely on lists to help you gain promotion. The gap year after A levels is almost a rite of passage and taking a year out after university to travel around the world has become so common that it's almost pass\u00e9. But what about taking a year out during your degree? Some students don't find the transition from A levels to degree studies easy. After a year or two at university they yearn to get out into the world either to gain some work experience or travel - and they don't want to wait until they graduate. But how common is it for students to interrupt their studies? \"I haven't come across it often,\" says Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters. \"However, when it does happen the most common reasons for doing so are because of illness or financial problems.\" A recent survey by the Mental Health Foundation showed that 50% of university students showed signs of clinical anxiety and more than one in 10 suffered from clinical depression. However, he says that if undergraduates decide to take a year out during their degree, it's important that they don't do it on a whim. \"As with any career decision you need to weigh up the pros and cons. If you do take a year out you need to be able to explain why to prospective employers. It may surprise some, but if you have done something constructive, you can present a year out in a positive light.\" Carl does warn that one of the dangers of taking a year out is that some undergraduates are reluctant to return and complete their degree, particularly if they have spent their year out working. Not so with Matthew Bright who took a year out while studying for an anthropology degree at one of the universities in London. \"I went straight from A levels to university but I made a mistake when I picked my first degree subject, physics. I was accepted through clearing and perhaps if I hadn't I may have had time to think about what I really wanted to do.\" After his first year, Matthew realised that physics was not for him and quit because of financial problems. He then applied to another London University to study anthropology. \"It was the best decision I've ever made. The course was fascinating and I made a lot of new friends. However, during my second year, I thought it ironic that here I was learning about ancient tribes when I hadn't even travelled myself. So I decided after my second year to take a year out and go travelling, mainly in Africa and Asia,\" he explains. Matthew, who now works for an environmental consultancy, did not find that employers viewed his year out suspiciously. \"The places where I travelled to were amazing and in interviews, employers were really interested about why and what I did. I don't think that it has adversely affected my career.\" This comes as no surprise to Roger Hughes, head of careers service at Queen Mary, University of London. \"A year out during a degree is more common than it used to be.

      "byline": "Michael Billington",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's almost like the old days. Political theatre has started popping up everywhere. Topical satire in Alistair Beaton's Feelgood. Dialectical debate in Camus's Les Justes. Impassioned protest and philosophical enquiry in two plays about asylum-seekers, Kay Adshead's The Bogus Woman and Timberlake Wertenbaker's Credible Witness. Suddenly theatre seems an important activity again rather than a marginal delight. </p> <p>Obviously political theatre ebbs and flows. It was strongest in Britain in the immediate post-1968 period. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements in Paris, student revolt, the growth of women's lib, the dispatch of British troops to Northern Ireland - all these, plus the emergence of fringe theatre and the end of theatrical censorship, conspired to produce a frenzied volatility. Even the failures of the left in Britain, and the ability of capitalism to absorb revolutionary impulses, yielded a political masterwork in Trevor Griffiths's The Party, premiered at the National Theatre in 1973. </p> <p>The Thatcherite 1980s also yielded much oppositional theatre. Writers such as David Hare, David Edgar, Caryl Churchill and Alan Ayckbourn attacked the grasping spirit of the times. But political theatre has fallen out of fashion. Mark Ravenhill and Sarah Kane have registered a moral disgust with the Thatcherite legacy, but theatrical economics militate against state-of-the-nation plays. More crucially, the Blairite big-tent approach has tended to stifle ideological debate. As Max Stafford-Clark said at a discussion at the Bush this week: \"In the 80s we all knew who the enemy was. Now we are not so sure.\" </p> <p>Does the decline of political theatre matter? Desperately, I would say. I am not claiming it is the sole function of theatre to analyse government and society. But if drama withdraws from engagement with the public world, it is inevitably diluted. It is no accident that attacks on theatre have increased as drama has privatised experience. You may dislike a theatre that deals with societal violence or ingrained colonialism - as in Edward Bond's Saved or Howard Brenton's The Romans in Britain - but you can't ignore it. </p> <p>I'd go further and say that drama is less vital when it ceases to relate private experience to the public world. It's a bit unfair to pick on Simon Gray, a good dramatist whose oeuvre commands respect. But his latest play, Japes, proves my point. It offers an insightful study of a sibling relationship over 27 years. But, except for a bilious attack on conscienceless youth, private lives are not influenced by public events. The brothers change but Britain seemingly doesn't, even though the action covers the years from Heath's accession to Major's decline. For all its virtues, the play offers a goldfish-bowl view of life. </p> <p>If political theatre is to make a comeback it cannot resurrect old forms. The epic, state-of-the-nation play looks to be a dead duck, and not just for financial reasons. How does a dramatist attempt to speak for Britain at a time of governmental devolution, growing nationalism and a massive north-south divide? In recent years, only Peter Whelan has written a big work on an epic subject - Divine Right (1996), about monarchy; but that, while admirably adventurous, subverted its own republican premise. </p> <p>If political theatre is to survive, it has to constantly reinvent itself. One way, in an age top-heavy with opinion, is by establishing the importance of fact. For me The Colour of Justice, the Tricycle Theatre's edited version of the McPherson enquiry into the Stephen Lawrence killing, was the most exciting political play of recent years. It took us behind closed doors to reveal not just the police's criminal negligence but the warped racism of the prime suspects. The enquiry's stripping away of institutional evasion also had the contours of Sophoclean tragedy. In short, The Colour of Justice showed that documentary drama can be aesthetically exciting as well as crucially informative. </p> <p>The key to the political drama of the future is information. We want stories, but we also want to feel that the writer is communicating his or her researches. That can come in a variety of ways. </p> <p> The great strength of Kay Adshead's The Bogus Woman, brilliantly performed by Noma Dumezweni at the Bush, is that it transmits the writer's incredulous shock at the operation of the asylum system in this country. Adshead shows the racism of the privatised security guards at Campsfield Detention Centre, the bureaucracy confronting an appellant against deportation and the nightmare of trying to survive on weekly \u00a330 food vouchers. The play is written in anger but rooted in reality. </p> <p>But information can take many forms. David Hare's Via Dolorosa was, on one level, a superb piece of reportage about modern Israel; it was also a philosophical enquiry into the limits of fiction in dealing with political fact. And even when fiction seems the appropriate form - as in Feelgood, Alistair Beaton's merciless satire on political spin - a play's strength derives from its intimate knowledge of the system. Only this week it emerged that Labour's new mantra is \"the challenge of change\", lines that actually come from the PM's proposed conference speech in Beaton's peerlessly prophetic play. </p> <p>When I talk about the need for more political theatre to directors and dramaturgs, however, I often get the same response: you can't force writers to write the plays you want. Of course not. But the lesson of recent times is that theatres and companies can be more proactive in marrying writers to subjects. It's happened with the Tricycle, who initiated the documentary agenda, and with The Red Room, who commissioned The Bogus Woman.

      "bodyText": "It's almost like the old days. Political theatre has started popping up everywhere. Topical satire in Alistair Beaton's Feelgood. Dialectical debate in Camus's Les Justes. Impassioned protest and philosophical enquiry in two plays about asylum-seekers, Kay Adshead's The Bogus Woman and Timberlake Wertenbaker's Credible Witness. Suddenly theatre seems an important activity again rather than a marginal delight. Obviously political theatre ebbs and flows. It was strongest in Britain in the immediate post-1968 period. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements in Paris, student revolt, the growth of women's lib, the dispatch of British troops to Northern Ireland - all these, plus the emergence of fringe theatre and the end of theatrical censorship, conspired to produce a frenzied volatility. Even the failures of the left in Britain, and the ability of capitalism to absorb revolutionary impulses, yielded a political masterwork in Trevor Griffiths's The Party, premiered at the National Theatre in 1973. The Thatcherite 1980s also yielded much oppositional theatre. Writers such as David Hare, David Edgar, Caryl Churchill and Alan Ayckbourn attacked the grasping spirit of the times. But political theatre has fallen out of fashion. Mark Ravenhill and Sarah Kane have registered a moral disgust with the Thatcherite legacy, but theatrical economics militate against state-of-the-nation plays. More crucially, the Blairite big-tent approach has tended to stifle ideological debate. As Max Stafford-Clark said at a discussion at the Bush this week: \"In the 80s we all knew who the enemy was. Now we are not so sure.\" Does the decline of political theatre matter? Desperately, I would say. I am not claiming it is the sole function of theatre to analyse government and society. But if drama withdraws from engagement with the public world, it is inevitably diluted. It is no accident that attacks on theatre have increased as drama has privatised experience. You may dislike a theatre that deals with societal violence or ingrained colonialism - as in Edward Bond's Saved or Howard Brenton's The Romans in Britain - but you can't ignore it. I'd go further and say that drama is less vital when it ceases to relate private experience to the public world. It's a bit unfair to pick on Simon Gray, a good dramatist whose oeuvre commands respect. But his latest play, Japes, proves my point. It offers an insightful study of a sibling relationship over 27 years. But, except for a bilious attack on conscienceless youth, private lives are not influenced by public events. The brothers change but Britain seemingly doesn't, even though the action covers the years from Heath's accession to Major's decline. For all its virtues, the play offers a goldfish-bowl view of life. If political theatre is to make a comeback it cannot resurrect old forms. The epic, state-of-the-nation play looks to be a dead duck, and not just for financial reasons. How does a dramatist attempt to speak for Britain at a time of governmental devolution, growing nationalism and a massive north-south divide? In recent years, only Peter Whelan has written a big work on an epic subject - Divine Right (1996), about monarchy; but that, while admirably adventurous, subverted its own republican premise. If political theatre is to survive, it has to constantly reinvent itself. One way, in an age top-heavy with opinion, is by establishing the importance of fact. For me The Colour of Justice, the Tricycle Theatre's edited version of the McPherson enquiry into the Stephen Lawrence killing, was the most exciting political play of recent years. It took us behind closed doors to reveal not just the police's criminal negligence but the warped racism of the prime suspects. The enquiry's stripping away of institutional evasion also had the contours of Sophoclean tragedy. In short, The Colour of Justice showed that documentary drama can be aesthetically exciting as well as crucially informative. The key to the political drama of the future is information. We want stories, but we also want to feel that the writer is communicating his or her researches. That can come in a variety of ways. The great strength of Kay Adshead's The Bogus Woman, brilliantly performed by Noma Dumezweni at the Bush, is that it transmits the writer's incredulous shock at the operation of the asylum system in this country. Adshead shows the racism of the privatised security guards at Campsfield Detention Centre, the bureaucracy confronting an appellant against deportation and the nightmare of trying to survive on weekly \u00a330 food vouchers. The play is written in anger but rooted in reality. But information can take many forms. David Hare's Via Dolorosa was, on one level, a superb piece of reportage about modern Israel; it was also a philosophical enquiry into the limits of fiction in dealing with political fact. And even when fiction seems the appropriate form - as in Feelgood, Alistair Beaton's merciless satire on political spin - a play's strength derives from its intimate knowledge of the system. Only this week it emerged that Labour's new mantra is \"the challenge of change\", lines that actually come from the PM's proposed conference speech in Beaton's peerlessly prophetic play. When I talk about the need for more political theatre to directors and dramaturgs, however, I often get the same response: you can't force writers to write the plays you want. Of course not. But the lesson of recent times is that theatres and companies can be more proactive in marrying writers to subjects. It's happened with the Tricycle, who initiated the documentary agenda, and with The Red Room, who commissioned The Bogus Woman. When challenged - as I was recently - to name topics the British theatre should be dealing with, I would say they are self-evident: Europe, comprehensive education, the rural revolt, the resurgence of direct action as in the petrol-price protest. The result may not automatically be good plays. But I stick with my original contention: theatre is a place of information as well as entertainment and the more it cuts itself off from society - and relies on a mixture of anodyne musicals and Hollywood-star casting - the more it is is doomed to glamorous irrelevance. \u0095 The Bogus Woman is at the Bush, London W12 (020-7610 4224), and Les Justes is at the Gate, London W11 (020-7229 0706), until March 3.

High jagged peaks and unblemished snow stretched towards Italy. In the distance was the white-capped peak of Mont Blanc, while below chunks of ice the size of skycrapers glistened from shafts of sunlight. This was the start of the Vall\u00e9e Blanche, a 22km ski run. </p> <p>There comes a time in every skier's life when you reach a plateau. For the vast majority of us, that is where we stay, often for several years, until the temptation to aim for the next level becomes too much. </p> <p>Fortunately the modern approach to improving your skiing is no longer to practice your technique on boring, easy slopes. Far from it, now the idea is to push yourself to the limit. Which is why I found myself roped up to a group of skiers on the Vall\u00e9e Blanche in Chamonix. </p> <p>\"We all know instinctively that there is a better skier locked inside each of us,\" said the brochure from Ski Weekend, a company on a mission to get skiers off crowded pistes. For the uninitiated there are different levels of specialist weekend courses that push you to your limit, but will get you skiing down slopes in the sorts of conditions you would never have dreamed possible. </p> <p>The instructor for \"Piste Perfection\", a four-day course aimed at strong intermediate skiers, was John Pickett, a trainer for the BASI (British Association of Ski Instructors). Over dinner I discussed his techniques and listened to glowing reports from his pupils, most of whom were in an exuberant but exhausted state after their day's skiing. \"Race training is where it is at,\" declared Pickett. \"We've probably been teaching people the wrong method of skiing for 20 years. You watch those racers, look at their technique and precision, they are the best technical skiers in the world.\" </p> <p>The Vall\u00e9e Blanche is one of the most stunningly beautiful glacial runs in the Alps it is also the biggest vertical descent. The easiest version, a straightforward piste, can be attempted by any confident intermediate parallel skier. The only hair-raising bit is the \"arret\" as you emerge from the highest cable car in Europe, the Aiguille du Midi at 3,842m. There is a five-minute walk along a ridge above a 2,000m abyss. The guide ropes you together for the short walk along the ridge, your skis preferably attached to a rucksack. From there it is on to a high mountain adventure through the massive seracs of the glacier, with Mont Blanc in the background. </p> <p>On this particular day the wind was vicious. We could see great gusts of snow howling into the sky as the cable car reached its destination. The few minutes in the wind, while we hung onto the fixed rope were desperate, feet and fingers going numb within seconds. But we quickly warmed up and began a route called the \"Petit Envers du Plan\". </p> <p>For most of the group it was their first high-mountain, off-piste adventure. In the previous three days under the tuition of Yves Detry, a legendary guide who completed the first descent of the north side of the Aiguille du Midi, their skiing had improved beyond recognition. Our route took us away from the main piste, and by the time we reached the bottom we had encounted every kind of snow, from powder to breakable crust, and every type of terrain. \"If you can ski in this you can call yourselves skiers,\" said Detry, demonstrating how your weight had to be exactly over your skis to turn in the crusty surface. We all failed miserably but nothing could wipe the grins off our faces. </p> <p>Earlier that weekend I had spent a day with a group tackling another side of Chamonix. We began with a fast off-piste run in knee-high powder down the east side of the Grands Montets in Argenti\u00e8re, which is guaranteed to get any enthusiast's heart pumping. What would follow, I wondered. Word filtered through that it was to be a run called the \"Pas de Chevre\" - a goat path off the Grands Montets. </p> <p>Next to the start of this route is the Rectiligne couloir, a 40-45 degree narrow gully which my Guide de Hors Piste in Chamonix describes as a \"serious commitment\". Before any of us had time to think about backing out, our guide for this section, Gilbert Matillat, was getting out his rope to facilitate our entry into the couloir. Generous lashings of snow gave us perfect conditions but nevertheless this was more like an adventure than a gentle day's skiing. </p> <p>A couple of hours later having traversed across snow bridges, over crevasses, and weaved our way through a forest of saplings and an area of moraine - a virtual rock garden - we emerged at the bottom. The sense of satisfaction was far greater than a day of pounding the pistes. </p> <p>On any ski holiday it is easy to find you are not making the best use of your time. A bit of know-how, such as where to get your rental equipment and lift pass before the day begins, where to have lunch, and how to avoid lift queues, can save a lot of time. If you are only going for a few days, it's essential. Ski Weekend has got this down to a fine art, so much so that by the end of the trip you feel you have made the best use of every available second. </p> <p><strong>You don't have to take it to extremes</strong></p> <p>Chamonix is situated at the base of Mont Blanc and is considered to be the climbing and extreme skiing capital of the world.

And, to be hot, of course, it's cool - floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides, white walls, wooden floor, hard surfaces, open kitchen, snazzy service, and already full to bursting and bubbling away within just a few weeks of opening - which makes it very hot indeed. That's what a couple of powerhouse reviews from influential critics and the buzz of word of mouth can do for you. </p> <p>Mind you, it's not so surprising. Jake Hodges, chef/prop and moving spirit behind Cigala, had also been a moving spirit, along with Sam and Sam Clark, at that favourite Guardian executives' watering hole, Moro, when it opened for business around the corner a couple of years back. Conveniently, Cigala in Lamb's Conduit Street is not all that much further than Moro from the Farringdon Road headquarters, only in the opposite direction and towards the West End, so now the money-bags figures who throng the meeting rooms of power at the world's greatest newspaper needn't sit quite so cheek by jowl with their colleagues any more. </p> <p>Not that Cigala is in any way, shape or form a clone of Moro. It has the same relaxed and confident air, sure, and it strikes the same note of youthful democracy. But, in spite of such generic similarities, it has very much a character and rhythm all of its own. Moro, of course, quite explicitly explores the connection between the cooking of Spain and North Africa through the sympathetic medium of the two Sams. Jake Hodges, on the other hand, seems to be sticking much more closely to the Spanish original - I am almost tempted to use that dread word, \"authentic\", here - albeit with all the Arab influences that that implies. </p> <p>Take, for instance, the grilled langoustines with romesco sauce that Leonora Number 3 had as her main course. Langoustines are the closest we'll get to a real cigala among our native seafood, and these examples were appropriately sweet and juicy. The romesco sauce was made from red chilli, garlic, tomato, vinegar and ground almonds, which is a distinctively Arab touch - the almonds have the effect of adding a soft, grainy thickness to the pepper, thereby tempering the heat as well as broadening the fruitiness of the other ingredients. In order to make this assessment, I had to use my finger to scrape out the little bowl bearing the sauce. Leonora had put paid to the rest. </p> <p>Her husband, Ludwig, meanwhile, was quietly working his way through grilled gilthead bream with braised sprouting broccoli and salsa churrasco, on which he lavished a great deal of praise with his customary eloquence: \"Very good. This is really very good - very, very good.\" </p> <p>He had said much the same about the gloriously rich glop of caldo Gallego that he polished off in good order as a first course. This was a soup of chorizo, butter beans and turnip tops, in which the beans had been cooked to the point of creamy disintegration. While this was indeed a glorious glop, you could still taste each of the principal ingredients, which gave it great variety when each mouthful slid down the hatch, and it was, indeed, \"very good - very, very good.\" </p> <p>My contribution, aside from ordering three glasses of very chirrupy manzanilla sherry and a bottle of Lanzaga - something of a maverick rioja, apparently, with remarkable heft, staying power, elegance and finesse - was a soup plate of clams with garlic, parsley and manzanilla, the kind of dish for which I am a complete sucker. </p> <p>You can't get away from the fact that clams are a great deal of cheerfully mucky work to get to those little nuggets of rather fugitive flavour, and this dish was great fun to eat. It would have been even more so had the broth in which the clams sat been a touch less salty. My slight misgivings over the clam juices were swept aside by the pleasure of cured shoulder of pork with potatoes, turnips and spinach. If that sounds hearty, then, yes, it was - there was plenty of fat on the pig to ensure that it was tender and tasty right up to the end, but the curing had also given it a distinctive delicacy that brought a certain lightness to the dish as a whole. So that didn't last long. </p> <p>I had been warned that the puddings at Cigala weren't quite on the same plane as the other courses, and my informant was right - they weren't, not by a long shot - and so it seems kinder to pass over them in silence. I am sure that they'll be sorting out the pudding department soon, because Cigala is too good and too professional an outfit not to do so sharpish, and when it does, it'll move up a point or so on the Fort ratings. In fact, by the time this review comes out, they will probably have done so already. </p> <p>The bill was \u00a3140 on the nose, which is quite a lot, but not really Cigala's fault. The food side of things was a highly reasonable \u00a360 for the three of us. The rest went on two bottles of the Lanzaga, sherries of various denominations and water - and not a single penny was wasted</p>",

      "body": "<p>Oxford Street, the most famous shopping street in Britain, is playing host to one of the more genuinely disturbing art events of recent years. Michael Landy's Break Down is a piece of alternative retail therapy housed in what was once a C&amp;A department store near Marble Arch. Dominating the stripped-down retail space is a long, winding automatic conveyor belt which reminds one, in a consumer year-zero sort of way, of the famous conveyor belt of prizes in The Generation Game, carrying as it does an endlessly circling succession of trays of Michael Landy's stuff, in different stages of breakdown. </p> <p>About two years ago, Landy decided he was going to get rid of everything. Take it apart and destroy it. Not as a criticism of consumerism, he says, but as a consumerist experiment in identity. To find out what it felt like. To find out how much of his life depended on what he used, what he owned. At the show's private view last week, he still didn't know how he was going to feel as the conveyor belt sprang his intricately planned project into action. The next day he told me he thought it was the happiest day of his life. He'd seen people moved to tears. He'd also seen them nicking stuff from the trays, but that's consumerism, part of what he expected. </p> <p>Over the next two weeks, the artist and his nine assistants, all dressed in the same blue overalls, will break down into their constituent parts more than 7,000 items that were once his, the material sum total of the artist's life. Each part of each part will be logged onto a database as it is torn, ripped and broken apart, shredded, and then reduced to fine granules of matter that Landy hopes to bury in a shopping mall. </p> <p>This assembly line of personal breakdown was designed by the artist and assembled by DSC, a real-life company (\"Providing Solutions to the Waste Handling Industry\"). This echoes Landy's previous major project, Scrap Heap Services, now owned by Tate Britain. In that show, thousands of cut-out tin figures were fed into a shredding machine - a comment on the disposability of the worker-consumer in a voraciously consuming society. With Break Down, however, it has become personal. </p> <p>There is a gantry over the conveyor system, where the artist can be seen standing, conductor-like, picking trays of his belongings to be dispatched into the industrial shredder. Then there are four bays where assistants are busy dismantling and sorting everything he owned from clothes to personal stereos. His own stereo, he says, is made up of 243 parts. In the bay in front of the gantry is a red Saab, the engine suspended over the open bonnet, piece by piece being taken apart by an expert Saab mechanic called Dave. </p> <p>With Break Down, John Lennon's notion of \"Imagine no possessions\" becomes an eerie reality, and there's a Zen-like feel to the event, to which the throng of visitors bear witness. As we mill around the deconstruction lines, many of us in groups - for there is safety in numbers when faced with such wholesale destruction - it is impossible to escape Break Down's encompassing frame, for nothing is being performed here. It is simply being done, and undone. We are witnesses to an obsessive, unwavering process of sorting, labelling, deconstruction and destruction. So just your average working day then. As Landy's personal effects and consumer fetishes are reduced to base matter, the witnessing crowd is framed by its own baggage, and by Oxford Street itself. </p> <p>The trays take about 10 minutes to make a complete circuit of the conveyor belt and, if you stay long enough, what seems an endless stream begins to find its peculiar place in your memory. You find yourself tracking specific things, choosing what you'd want to keep, wondering when they'll disappear. A pair of boots, computer parts, electrical wiring, mattress stuffing, drawings, prints, photographs, exhibition catalogues, a bread basket, a red, wooden wagon wheel. Break Down is relentless and, as it circles towards its inevitable destruction, I think of the piles of spectacles and shoes in Nazi death camps, of Holocaust victims, stripped of their belongings and their humanity. Not that the work is drawing a direct link but, by its very nature, Break Down encourages the witness to follow their own associations, and to wonder how much of what it is to be human is in what we own. </p> <p>By lunchtime, the place is full of people, but it is the sound of the conveyor system and not the buzz of voices that you hear. Group after group mills past the huge inventories, like lists of war dead, that line the rear walls of the space under separate headings: Artwork, Clothes, Electrical, Furniture. Here and there are redundant shop signs that by default become part of Break Down - a Please Pay Here sign hung over the gantry, and posters peeling from the walls echoing Landy's early-1990s exhibition at Karsten Schubert's: Closing Down Sale. Everything Must Go. </p> <p>And go it will. There is no end product, for the artist or the art market. By February 24, Landy will have nothing left but his memories, and the ladder to the gantry which he bought himself for a little more than \u00a3400. </p> <p> What will be the last possession to be broken down? The keys to the car, perhaps. Or maybe his father's coat. Landy admits to making emotional choices when dispatching items to the shredder. And I wonder what will be his first purchases, his first consuming steps back to his own belongings, and how he will make them, and for how long he will, like Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, depend on the kindness of strangers. </p> <p>When I told people about Break Down some laughed and a few were angry. \"Anger?\" says Landy, \"That's good. I had thought about recycling it or selling it or giving it all away. But it had to be destroyed.\" His process of self-revelation, his consumerist strip show, takes the opposite route of Tracey Emin's graphic self-display or Damien Hirst's professional commodification. Instead of showing out, Landy's Break Down journeys within, consuming what is his and discarding the accoutrements of modern life to find out exactly what happens when nothing's left. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Landy's Break Down is at 499-523 Oxford Street, London W1, until February 24.</p>",

But it had to be destroyed.\" His process of self-revelation, his consumerist strip show, takes the opposite route of Tracey Emin's graphic self-display or Damien Hirst's professional commodification. Instead of showing out, Landy's Break Down journeys within, consuming what is his and discarding the accoutrements of modern life to find out exactly what happens when nothing's left. \u0095 Michael Landy's Break Down is at 499-523 Oxford Street, London W1, until February 24.",

If some of them are still looking beautiful, even though dying or dead, I like to leave them. Ornamental grasses are a notable example.

More than that, however, I find that the gales to which we have even more than usual been subjected, strip the seed heads too or make them look shabby.

Calamagrostis acutiflora 'Karl Foerster', with its pale, vertical rods, is notable among these. It retains a ghostly presence. </p> <p>I grow quantities of border phloxes, mostly cultivars of Phlox paniculata , because they make a huge display in July-August and they love our heavy soil. Their dying stems are not particularly beautiful but, till the end of the year, they are not an eyesore either. One of our chief reasons for leaving them is that they take months to die completely. Withdrawal of all their sap is only complete at the end of December.

These leave the field clear for snowdrops and tulips growing among them. </p> <p>Red-hot pokers, or other knipho-fias, are evergreen but with masses of lanky leaves. We shorten these by about half. If the colonies need replanting - and they do flower less freely when congested - we shall tackle that job in late March or April. Kniphofias are not 100% hardy and should not be disturbed until then. They can do with a further cleaning up at that time, by peeling away tired old outer leaves. Snails love to doss down among kniphofia shoots, and you can have quite a field day collecting and disposing of them. </p> <p>I love the skeletons of old cardoon flower heads, but even they may break up after months of being battered and there is already strong new basal foliage prominent by the end of January. We shall take the hint and remove their old stakes and ties and cut down the stems. My cardoons have never needed replanting in 50 years. </p> <p>Some plants continue to look so good right up to mid-spring that it is a wrench to say goodbye to their old growth even then. The thistly, autumn-flowering Serratula seoanei is a prime example. When its dead flower heads are completely sere and dry, as they will be in the face of chill March winds, they open out into pale brown rosettes which look like a kind of second flowering. The dead heads of sedums are a classic example of skeletons that will remain admirable till the very last moment. </p> <p>Once you have cut down, it is difficult to imagine just what was, and is, growing where; how tall and how bulky it was.

He then knows how near to them he can go with adjacent plantings. The canes are removed when all plantings have been completed.

      "body": "<p>Many of the Tranmere Rovers supporters heading for today's fifth round FA Cup tie at Southampton are still pinching themselves. Three weeks ago, the Mersey minnows headed upriver, with some trepidation, to face local giants Everton of the Premier League. </p> <p>Tranmere are the team from Birkenhead, on the \"other side\" of the Mersey, plying their meagre trade in the shadows of the Cammel Laird shipyards. Like Lairds, the Rovers keep cheating extinction by a whisker. And they keep doing it in style, as those present at Goodison Park on January 27 will readily attest. </p> <p>Fair enough, Everton is a giant who has been having a good old snooze lately. So sleepy, in fact, that they've fought more relegation battles than title tussles in recent years. Nonetheless, with a squad packed full of internationals, the Toffees would have been expecting to dispatch Rovers with some comfort. </p> <p>Not so. With 15 minutes of the tie still remaining, Rovers were 3-0 up, cruising, conjuring up a brand of football that was more Cruyff than Crewe Alexandra and, frankly, playing Everton off the pitch. Goodison Park was empty except for 6,000 delirious Tranmere fans chanting \"Can we play you every week?\" and a smattering of Evertonions who stayed behind to applaud the opposition off the pitch. </p> <p>It was fairytale stuff, ranking alongside the Herefords and Colchesters and all the other great giant-killing acts that have burnished the FA Cup's legend over the years. That's why Tranmere, not Everton, are heading for Southampton today - and they'll be quietly confident of causing another minor upset. </p> <p>Over the past decade, Tranmere have made a habit of upsetting the big boys. They are always referred to as Merseyside's third team, often prefaced with patronising tags such as \"plucky\" Rovers or \"brave little Tranmere\". Yet since Gazza watered the pitch in Italia 90, and in so doing helped change the face - and the price - of modern football, plucky little Tranmere have accounted for some exotic scalps. Aston Villa, Chelsea, Coventry, Leeds, Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham have all gone the same way as Everton. Beaten, and beaten well. </p> <p>If ever a team reflected the values of their manager it is Tranmere. John Aldridge has been at Prenton Park since 1991, but prior to that made his name as a goal poacher of the highest efficacy for Liverpool, Real Sociedad in Spain, and for the Republic of Ireland. Everywhere he played, Aldridge scored goals. His record of 430 goals in 743 competitive games (not including internationals) is a strike ratio that comfortably eclipses those of current hotshots such as Andy Cole, Michael Owen and Kevin Phillips. In recent years, only Ian Wright and Robbie Fowler come close to Aldridge's goals-per-game efficiency. </p> <p>Aldridge played with a mixture of courage, technique and passion that is the hallmark of the team he manages today. He still berates the referee as vehemently as ever he did as a player, still patrols the touchline as if he's looking to beat the offside trap. Living in the shadow of Merseyside's affluent big two, and with Gold Trafford a mere 30 minutes' drive away, Aldridge has fashioned a competitive, progressive team out of an unfashionable club. He's produced a team that local fans feel proud to support and one that they can identify with. The spirit and work ethic and the sheer, dogged anti-fashion stance of Tranmere Rovers seem to be the major reference points to the 8,000 diehards who regularly pass over the sophistication of Anfield and Goodison to take up their places at Prenton Park. </p> <p>Tranmere have no Paolos, Vladimirs or Thierrys - they have Andys, Steves, Ians and Daves. The fans seem to like Tranmere's no-frills range, and in turn bring their own slightly down-home brand of support to the picnic. This season, for instance, Tranmere are struggling against relegation, third from bottom in Division One, yet the fans fail to invoke their right to slate the team and call for the manager's head. Perversely, they seem to try to encourage them instead, as though they were all in the fight together. </p> <p>Last season, Aldridge, his team and their supporters were rewarded for their faith with an appearance at Wembley in the final of the Worthington Cup, where they were narrowly beaten by Leicester City. Tranmere were a game away from European qualification. It might have been they, not Liverpool, who played in Rome on Thursday evening. The beaten finalists returned to a welcoming multitude outside Birkenhead Town Hall, the fans once again proud of their humble heroes. The future, if not dazzling, was at least shining on dipped headlights. </p> <p>It was not ever so. On May 8, 1987, Tranmere played a match against Exeter City that was to prove historic. The arithmetic was simple. Tranmere had to win in order to stay in the Football League. Depending on results, either Tranmere, Burnley or Lincoln City would drop into non-league football - an outcome that had already sounded the death knell for clubs such as Accrington Stanley, Bradford Park Avenue and Barrow, all unable to continue trading on the reduced revenues of minor league football. Tranmere were favourites to go down. Their support that season had dwindled to a core of 2,000 regulars, morale was low and expectations were nil. </p> <p>A charismatic local businessman, Peter Johnson, had just taken over as chairman of the club from a well-meaning but remote American entrepreneur called Bruce Osterman, but Johnson's five-year regeneration plan had barely begun. The ground capacity of Prenton Park was set at 7,000 that season - 6,983 hardy souls crammed inside for this win-or-bust match, but their noise and optimism of the first half gave way to unbearable tension and, ultimately, strained silence as the match went into its last 10 minutes with the score still 0-0. </p> <p>In the 84th minute, a jobbing journeyman called Gary Williams trotted upfield. Until that moment, Williams was best known for his Michael Bolton barnet. Williams invented the Michael Bolton barnet. Managing to combine a pate more bare than Bobby Charlton's with a tightly permed, collar-length derri\u00e8re, Williams laid the ghost of his slaphead mullet with a crashing header into the roof of the net. Tranmere stayed up. Lincoln went down. The rest is history. </p> <p>The following season, and via an arcane points system that nobody truly understood, Tranmere arrived at Wembley as one of Division Four's two representatives in the Centenary Challenge Cup, a pan-league jolly to celebrate the FA's 100th birthday. Tranmere were to play in a knockout tournament against teams such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Wolves and the then-mighty Wimbledon. Most Tranmere fans of that era saw it as a one-off, never to be repeated chance to see plucky little Rovers play on the hallowed turf. </p> <p>Pat Healey, who at 87 can remember Dixie Dean when he was a Tranmere player, was planning a nice day-trip to Wembley with his son, Tim, also a Tranmere fanatic. Tim takes up the story: \"We'd drawn against Wimbledon first. Don't forget who was in that team. John Scales, Nigel Winterburn, Dennis Wise, Vinnie Jones, Lawrie Sanchez - it was the team that beat Liverpool later that year in the FA Cup Final. Everybody expected us to turn up, get beat, go home. But this was the start of our own great team, of sorts.\" </p> <p>Tranmere beat Wimbledon 1-0, then Newcastle 2-0, much to the delight of the Sunderland fans also present, who joined Tranmere's 3,000 voices to roar them on to victory. Tim Healey suddenly had a problem. \"We'd qualified for the semifinals. Fantastic. But the semifinals and the final were being played the next day. I don't think anybody had bothered booking for the second night. We all thought we'd be on our way home. There were still other matches to be played, but there was a sudden exodus of Rovers fans legging it back to the West End to look for hotels.\" </p> <p>In the event, Tranmere matched Nottingham Forest all the way in the semifinal and missed enough chances to have won. They went out in the lowest-scoring penalty shootout of all time - 1-0. </p> <p>Over successive seasons, though, Tranmere climbed from the old Fourth Division to the Third and the Second, ultimately returning to Wembley to beat Bolton 1-0 in the play-offs and gain a place in Division One. It was at this point that Tranmere pulled off perhaps their best piece of business ever. </p> <p>For a paltry \u00a3250,000 - a deal that turned out to be one of the cleverest and best-value signings in football - manager John King brought former Liverpool goal ace John Aldridge back from his then club, Real Sociedad. That move was only the latest in a grand tradition of former Liverpool and Everton stars taking the ferry cross the Mersey to see out their careers at Prenton Park. Prior to \"Aldo\", legendary figures from Bill Shankly's golden era such as The Flying Pig (aka, goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence) and Ron \"Rowdy\" Yeats cut a dash in front of the Tranmere faithful. But Aldridge blasted any notions of his best days being behind him with both feet and with stunning regularity. </p> <p>His signing was quickly followed by that of the mercurial Pat Nevin from Everton, seen by Pat Healey as the most entertaining Tranmere player in his recall: \"Oh, he was beautiful to watch. So clever. So audacious. Wee Pat Nevin on the wing...\" The Everton connection has continued, with Gary Stevens bringing experience and stability at right back until recently, Kevin Sheedy joining as first-team coach and Paul Rideout, the man who delivered the FA Cup to Everton in 1995, being there to helpknock them out six years later. But it was Aldridge, with 172 goals in 293 Tranmere games, who will be remembered as the cross-town transfer of all time. </p> <p>Aldridge comes from a working-class Liverpool Irish background. He came to the top level of the game comparatively late, having served his apprenticeship at South Liverpool, Newport County and Oxford United. This grounding in non-league and lower division football, along with his tough Liverpudlian upbringing, mean that Aldridge takes nothing for granted and expects the same no-nonsense attitude from his players: \"I won't stand for cowardice on any level,\" he says. \"I was always prepared to put my foot in, put my head in, even, and I demand that from anyone in my team. Take Jason [Koumas], for example. There isn't a better footballing brain in the country, nothing the lad can't do with the ball. But he's also now starting to understand his other responsibilities, responsibilities to his team mates. He's tracking back, he's closing down - he's working on those aspects of the game that ain't so pretty.\" </p> <p>Aldridge's period as manager (he took over from King in 1996) has coincided with great flux at the club. Chairman Peter Johnson's ambitions in football could not be met by lowly Tranmere and he departed for an ill-fated and unprofitable relationship with Everton. In his wake, different chairmen and boards of directors came and went, while the club was left in financial turmoil and its future started to dim once again. Aldridge is sanguine about the experience: \"It's been a tremendous learning curve for me. I've seen it all, and seen it from all sides. I've probably been through more in these five years than most managers experience in a lifetime. It's not that often that a manager sees off three chairmen!\" </p> <p>Aldridge's current chairman wears a Chanel suit and, until two years ago, was a very successful financial lawyer specialising in investment banking in the City of London. Lorraine Rogers had an affinity with Tranmere Rovers, but saw her initial involvement as a short-term, Red Adair-style specialist mission to stabilise the ailing club: \"Peter Johnson asked me if I could help. My initial reaction was no, football is not a sensible business, it doesn't follow usual business principles and procedures. It's too emotional and irrational. I told Peter I'd go and see if I could make the numbers work and we'd take it from there. And then Tranmere Rovers got to me. I got the bug.\" </p> <p>People all over the world talk of their \"love\" for their football club, but this is what happens, and clearly it happened with Rogers. You don't exchange vows or gold rings, but your relationship with the team you love, be that Barcelona or Bucchie Thistle, is for life. Time and time again, you wish you could kick the habit, save the money, do something, as Rogers says, \"sensible\". But football is emotional. It's irrational. For most of us, the rewards are few and far between, but when they come... They live with you forever. </p> <p>On the day, Rogers had mixed feelings about going to Goodison Park for the tie against Everton, given the Peter Johnson connection (Johnson sold his shareholding to Bill Kenwright, a lifetime Blue, after a wretched period in charge) but more so in light of her Wembley experience last year. \"I just wanted to enjoy the day this time, savour the journey, the build-up, the atmosphere. Against Leicester at Wembley, the whole day went by so quickly I barely remember it. So, for the Everton game, I just wanted our fans to enjoy themselves, and I wanted to enjoy it, too.\" </p> <p>Tim Healey was struck by the gulf in wealth between the two teams only when they ran out to warm up. \"You've got Everton with One 2 One on their shirts. They're sponsored for millions by a global telecommunications firm. We're sponsored by the local council. It makes you really want to win a game like that, you know? Do it for Football.\" </p> <p>Aldridge is typically philosophical about the financial chasm between himself and not just the big boys, but pretty well every other manager in Division One. \"I'm like any manager. I'd love to have money to spend. But we haven't got money here at Tranmere. I don't even bother looking at players who are going to cost a fee. I'll be out scouting at reserve matches. Trevor Francis is talking about his pride at taking Birmingham City to the (Worthington Cup) final. Good luck to him, but he's spent \u00a330m in getting them there. My team in last year's final cost \u00a3300,000 - and that was for one player.\" </p> <p>Lorraine Rogers is quick to praise the business savvy of her manager, while also pointing up the financial miracle Tranmere have achieved over the past two years. \"John understands. He's a fantastic manager to work with. But the reality for me when I came in was that, if we didn't raise half a million pounds by close of business, our loans were going to be called in. We had to sell Kenny (Irons, the captain, sold to Huddersfield) and then we did get a good deal with Ipswich over John McGreal. We don't have to sell players now. We're stable. Those days are over.\" </p> <p>One team member who remembers \"those days\", and many more before, is Andy Quayle, head groundsman at Tranmere since the 1987 Exeter relegation tussle. \"There have been days when we haven't had basic materials, you know - almost haven't had the gear to mark the pitch. But we've only lost one match to the elements in all the time I've been here. One match, and that was a sudden freeze up that not even the Met office predicted.\" </p> <p>It's a matter of pride to Andy that recently, while the big Liverpool v Everton derby match had to be postponed due to a waterlogged Anfield pitch, he was able to prepare a surface for the Tranmere v QPR game in conditions identical to those on the other side of the Mersey. \"We've got three staff, self included, to cover the main pitch, the training grounds and the youth team pitches. Liverpool have probably got 10. I'm not complaining, I love it here, but it does make you smile when you see what's happening at Old Trafford.\" </p> <p>Old Trafford is being urgently re-turfed. They have had problems with the playing surface at Manchester United for a few years now, and it's starting to handicap their free-flowing football. Alex Ferguson blames a rugby game played there for the deteriorating condition of the pitch. Quayle has a different theory: \"It's hard for the pitch to get any light on it now. The stands are so high, no sunlight can get through. They've filled in every corner. It's money in the bank to them, isn't it? If there's a gap somewhere, that could be 5,000 extra seats and all the revenue that brings.\" </p> <p>Old Trafford's 67,000 auditorium brings with it a certain type of football supporter, often branded as New Fans. The New Fan is typified by their club superstore carrier bags, their cameras and, according to Roy Keane, their prawn sandwiches. What Keane was getting at was that many fans, attracted to football's new, almost Hollywood profile, are starting to attend games to take in an all-round entertainment experience, rather than participating in a passion play. It's something Rogers is acutely aware of and, while she would love to have some level of corporate interest in Tranmere, what she wants most is a club that genuinely serves its own community: \"I love seeing Wirral Council on their shirts. It's not a sponsorship, it's a partnership. Our players love the work they do with the council. It's all about social inclusion and if we can inspire or fulfil just one young person then we're doing something right. We're doing good.\" </p> <p>That policy extends to the club's pricing. Under 16s can buy a season ticket for \u00a350. Attending on a match-by-match basis is \u00a33 per game. There are schemes and discounts for pensioners, for 17- to 22-year-olds and for regular attendees across the board. Justin Dooley is a 15-year-old fan who has been going to Tranmere since 1991. \"Lots of kids obviously go for Liverpool or Everton around here. But I just think Tranmere's different. There's something about going to matches here that you just don't get at the bigger clubs. I suppose I feel I can identify with players like Jason Koumas and Dave Challinor, players who are just local boys and seem to have stayed the same. Like, Michael Owen's just bought his family a street of houses. Even West Ham players are crashing Ferraris. Our players drive sponsored Fords!\" </p> <p>Pat Healey is resolute not just about Tranmere, but about the last vestiges of a Corinthian spirit still discernible in League football. \"There's still a sportsmanship here. There's a decency. I don't think our players would ever dive, or cheat to try to get another player sent off. I think the stakes are too high in the Premiership now. I don't know if I'd want to see Tranmere up there. It might spoil what we have here.\" </p> <p>Rogers is not so sure. \"I'm ambitious. I've never been very good for settling for anything - I always want the best. Beating Everton only gives you a taste for how far you could take a club like Tranmere. I think everyone should reach for the stars, no matter what.\" The day after the Everton victory, she popped into her local supermarket for a loaf of bread. To her supreme embarrassment, the busy Sainsbury's came to a sudden hush as people stopped and stared, then burst into spontaneous applause. </p> <p>If Tranmere overcome Premiership Southampton today and so continue their ongoing giant-slaying saga, Rogers might have to acquire a Gary Williams wig and tackle her grocery shopping incognito.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many of the Tranmere Rovers supporters heading for today's fifth round FA Cup tie at Southampton are still pinching themselves. Three weeks ago, the Mersey minnows headed upriver, with some trepidation, to face local giants Everton of the Premier League. Tranmere are the team from Birkenhead, on the \"other side\" of the Mersey, plying their meagre trade in the shadows of the Cammel Laird shipyards. Like Lairds, the Rovers keep cheating extinction by a whisker. And they keep doing it in style, as those present at Goodison Park on January 27 will readily attest. Fair enough, Everton is a giant who has been having a good old snooze lately. So sleepy, in fact, that they've fought more relegation battles than title tussles in recent years. Nonetheless, with a squad packed full of internationals, the Toffees would have been expecting to dispatch Rovers with some comfort. Not so. With 15 minutes of the tie still remaining, Rovers were 3-0 up, cruising, conjuring up a brand of football that was more Cruyff than Crewe Alexandra and, frankly, playing Everton off the pitch. Goodison Park was empty except for 6,000 delirious Tranmere fans chanting \"Can we play you every week?\" and a smattering of Evertonions who stayed behind to applaud the opposition off the pitch. It was fairytale stuff, ranking alongside the Herefords and Colchesters and all the other great giant-killing acts that have burnished the FA Cup's legend over the years. That's why Tranmere, not Everton, are heading for Southampton today - and they'll be quietly confident of causing another minor upset. Over the past decade, Tranmere have made a habit of upsetting the big boys. They are always referred to as Merseyside's third team, often prefaced with patronising tags such as \"plucky\" Rovers or \"brave little Tranmere\". Yet since Gazza watered the pitch in Italia 90, and in so doing helped change the face - and the price - of modern football, plucky little Tranmere have accounted for some exotic scalps. Aston Villa, Chelsea, Coventry, Leeds, Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham have all gone the same way as Everton. Beaten, and beaten well. If ever a team reflected the values of their manager it is Tranmere. John Aldridge has been at Prenton Park since 1991, but prior to that made his name as a goal poacher of the highest efficacy for Liverpool, Real Sociedad in Spain, and for the Republic of Ireland. Everywhere he played, Aldridge scored goals. His record of 430 goals in 743 competitive games (not including internationals) is a strike ratio that comfortably eclipses those of current hotshots such as Andy Cole, Michael Owen and Kevin Phillips. In recent years, only Ian Wright and Robbie Fowler come close to Aldridge's goals-per-game efficiency. Aldridge played with a mixture of courage, technique and passion that is the hallmark of the team he manages today. He still berates the referee as vehemently as ever he did as a player, still patrols the touchline as if he's looking to beat the offside trap. Living in the shadow of Merseyside's affluent big two, and with Gold Trafford a mere 30 minutes' drive away, Aldridge has fashioned a competitive, progressive team out of an unfashionable club. He's produced a team that local fans feel proud to support and one that they can identify with. The spirit and work ethic and the sheer, dogged anti-fashion stance of Tranmere Rovers seem to be the major reference points to the 8,000 diehards who regularly pass over the sophistication of Anfield and Goodison to take up their places at Prenton Park. Tranmere have no Paolos, Vladimirs or Thierrys - they have Andys, Steves, Ians and Daves. The fans seem to like Tranmere's no-frills range, and in turn bring their own slightly down-home brand of support to the picnic. This season, for instance, Tranmere are struggling against relegation, third from bottom in Division One, yet the fans fail to invoke their right to slate the team and call for the manager's head. Perversely, they seem to try to encourage them instead, as though they were all in the fight together. Last season, Aldridge, his team and their supporters were rewarded for their faith with an appearance at Wembley in the final of the Worthington Cup, where they were narrowly beaten by Leicester City. Tranmere were a game away from European qualification. It might have been they, not Liverpool, who played in Rome on Thursday evening. The beaten finalists returned to a welcoming multitude outside Birkenhead Town Hall, the fans once again proud of their humble heroes. The future, if not dazzling, was at least shining on dipped headlights. It was not ever so. On May 8, 1987, Tranmere played a match against Exeter City that was to prove historic. The arithmetic was simple. Tranmere had to win in order to stay in the Football League. Depending on results, either Tranmere, Burnley or Lincoln City would drop into non-league football - an outcome that had already sounded the death knell for clubs such as Accrington Stanley, Bradford Park Avenue and Barrow, all unable to continue trading on the reduced revenues of minor league football. Tranmere were favourites to go down. Their support that season had dwindled to a core of 2,000 regulars, morale was low and expectations were nil. A charismatic local businessman, Peter Johnson, had just taken over as chairman of the club from a well-meaning but remote American entrepreneur called Bruce Osterman, but Johnson's five-year regeneration plan had barely begun. The ground capacity of Prenton Park was set at 7,000 that season - 6,983 hardy souls crammed inside for this win-or-bust match, but their noise and optimism of the first half gave way to unbearable tension and, ultimately, strained silence as the match went into its last 10 minutes with the score still 0-0. In the 84th minute, a jobbing journeyman called Gary Williams trotted upfield. Until that moment, Williams was best known for his Michael Bolton barnet. Williams invented the Michael Bolton barnet. Managing to combine a pate more bare than Bobby Charlton's with a tightly permed, collar-length derri\u00e8re, Williams laid the ghost of his slaphead mullet with a crashing header into the roof of the net. Tranmere stayed up. Lincoln went down. The rest is history. The following season, and via an arcane points system that nobody truly understood, Tranmere arrived at Wembley as one of Division Four's two representatives in the Centenary Challenge Cup, a pan-league jolly to celebrate the FA's 100th birthday. Tranmere were to play in a knockout tournament against teams such as Liverpool, Newcastle, Wolves and the then-mighty Wimbledon. Most Tranmere fans of that era saw it as a one-off, never to be repeated chance to see plucky little Rovers play on the hallowed turf. Pat Healey, who at 87 can remember Dixie Dean when he was a Tranmere player, was planning a nice day-trip to Wembley with his son, Tim, also a Tranmere fanatic. Tim takes up the story: \"We'd drawn against Wimbledon first. Don't forget who was in that team. John Scales, Nigel Winterburn, Dennis Wise, Vinnie Jones, Lawrie Sanchez - it was the team that beat Liverpool later that year in the FA Cup Final. Everybody expected us to turn up, get beat, go home. But this was the start of our own great team, of sorts.\" Tranmere beat Wimbledon 1-0, then Newcastle 2-0, much to the delight of the Sunderland fans also present, who joined Tranmere's 3,000 voices to roar them on to victory. Tim Healey suddenly had a problem. \"We'd qualified for the semifinals. Fantastic. But the semifinals and the final were being played the next day. I don't think anybody had bothered booking for the second night. We all thought we'd be on our way home. There were still other matches to be played, but there was a sudden exodus of Rovers fans legging it back to the West End to look for hotels.\" In the event, Tranmere matched Nottingham Forest all the way in the semifinal and missed enough chances to have won. They went out in the lowest-scoring penalty shootout of all time - 1-0. Over successive seasons, though, Tranmere climbed from the old Fourth Division to the Third and the Second, ultimately returning to Wembley to beat Bolton 1-0 in the play-offs and gain a place in Division One. It was at this point that Tranmere pulled off perhaps their best piece of business ever. For a paltry \u00a3250,000 - a deal that turned out to be one of the cleverest and best-value signings in football - manager John King brought former Liverpool goal ace John Aldridge back from his then club, Real Sociedad. That move was only the latest in a grand tradition of former Liverpool and Everton stars taking the ferry cross the Mersey to see out their careers at Prenton Park. Prior to \"Aldo\", legendary figures from Bill Shankly's golden era such as The Flying Pig (aka, goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence) and Ron \"Rowdy\" Yeats cut a dash in front of the Tranmere faithful. But Aldridge blasted any notions of his best days being behind him with both feet and with stunning regularity. His signing was quickly followed by that of the mercurial Pat Nevin from Everton, seen by Pat Healey as the most entertaining Tranmere player in his recall: \"Oh, he was beautiful to watch. So clever. So audacious. Wee Pat Nevin on the wing...\" The Everton connection has continued, with Gary Stevens bringing experience and stability at right back until recently, Kevin Sheedy joining as first-team coach and Paul Rideout, the man who delivered the FA Cup to Everton in 1995, being there to helpknock them out six years later. But it was Aldridge, with 172 goals in 293 Tranmere games, who will be remembered as the cross-town transfer of all time. Aldridge comes from a working-class Liverpool Irish background. He came to the top level of the game comparatively late, having served his apprenticeship at South Liverpool, Newport County and Oxford United. This grounding in non-league and lower division football, along with his tough Liverpudlian upbringing, mean that Aldridge takes nothing for granted and expects the same no-nonsense attitude from his players: \"I won't stand for cowardice on any level,\" he says. \"I was always prepared to put my foot in, put my head in, even, and I demand that from anyone in my team. Take Jason [Koumas], for example. There isn't a better footballing brain in the country, nothing the lad can't do with the ball. But he's also now starting to understand his other responsibilities, responsibilities to his team mates. He's tracking back, he's closing down - he's working on those aspects of the game that ain't so pretty.\" Aldridge's period as manager (he took over from King in 1996) has coincided with great flux at the club. Chairman Peter Johnson's ambitions in football could not be met by lowly Tranmere and he departed for an ill-fated and unprofitable relationship with Everton. In his wake, different chairmen and boards of directors came and went, while the club was left in financial turmoil and its future started to dim once again. Aldridge is sanguine about the experience: \"It's been a tremendous learning curve for me. I've seen it all, and seen it from all sides. I've probably been through more in these five years than most managers experience in a lifetime. It's not that often that a manager sees off three chairmen!\" Aldridge's current chairman wears a Chanel suit and, until two years ago, was a very successful financial lawyer specialising in investment banking in the City of London. Lorraine Rogers had an affinity with Tranmere Rovers, but saw her initial involvement as a short-term, Red Adair-style specialist mission to stabilise the ailing club: \"Peter Johnson asked me if I could help. My initial reaction was no, football is not a sensible business, it doesn't follow usual business principles and procedures. It's too emotional and irrational. I told Peter I'd go and see if I could make the numbers work and we'd take it from there. And then Tranmere Rovers got to me.

      "body": "<p><strong>Margaret Atwood</strong> <br> Doctor Glas by Hjalmar S\u00f6dberg </p> <p> \"Now I sit at my open window, writing - for whom? Not for any friend or mistress. Scarcely for myself, even. I do not read today what I wrote yesterday; nor shall I read this tomorrow. I write simply so my hand can move, my thoughts move of their own accord. I write to kill a sleepless hour. Why can't I sleep? After all, I've committed no crime.\" </p> <p>This short, astonishing novel arrived in the mail a couple of years ago, sent by Swedish friends who ferret in secondhand bookstores in search of Swedish books in translation which they think I might like. They were spot-on with this one. Doctor Glas was first published in 1905 and caused a scandal then, in Sweden, for reasons that had to do with its handling of those two scandalous items, sex and death - not to mention their sub-sets, abortion and euthanasia. </p> <p>The version I have is a tattered paperback from 1970, a reissue of a 1963 translation - published I suppose to coincide with a film based on it, directed incidentally by Mai Zetterling. On the back of my copy are various encomiums, from the Observer, the Guardian, the Sunday Telegraph, the Glasgow Herald -\"a masterpiece\", \"the most remarkable book of the year\", and so forth. Still, as far as I know, Doctor Glas has long been out of print, at least in its English version. </p> <p>The narrator of Doctor Glas is Doctor Glas, a thirtyish man whose journal we hypocrites lecteurs read over his shoulder as he composes it. His is the remarkable yet unnervingly familiar voice we follow in its reflections, its prevarications, its self-denunciations, its boredoms, its wistfulness, its lyrical praises or splenetic denunciations of the weather. A romantic idealist turned solitary and sad, afflicted with fin-de-si\u00e8cle malaise, pestered by thoughts of Darwin and duty, Baudelaire and escapism, the longing for love and action, and the sceptical inertia of his age, unable to fall in love except with women who are in love with someone else, infested by his own unconscious - of which he is fitfully conscious - he offers both the candid transparency and the narcissism his surname would suggest.</p> <p> However, it's no accident that his second name is Gabriel, for he is tempted to play Angel of Life to a beautiful woman who arrives at his surgery one day begging for his help. Ignorant of what marriage entails, she has allowed herself to be pawned off on a \"respectable\" but morally and physically loathsome clergyman. The help she wants from Glas is freedom from this troll's sexual attentions, which she finds repugnant in the extreme - especially since she is having an affair with another man. Doctor Glas takes pity on her and invents a disease for her, and lies to the husband about it for her sake. </p> <p>Thus it begins. Angels can of course be angels of death as well as of life, and doctors are very conveniently situated for this role. I won't spoil the plot by telling what happens next, but it's a cunning triple-tied knot. Doctor Glas is deeply unsettling, in the way certain dreams are - or, no coincidence, certain films by Bergman, who must have read it. It moves from the sordid to the banal to the anxiously surreal to the visionary with economy and impressive style. A few years earlier and it would never have been published; a few years later and it would have been dubbed a forerunner of stream-of-consciousness. It occurs on the cusp of our century, opening doors we've been opening ever since. </p> <p>\"And now, as I sit at my open window, writing this by a flickering candle - I detest touching oil lamps and my housekeeper is sleeping too soundly after her funeral coffee and cakes for me to have the heart to wake her - now, as the candleflame flutters in the draught and my shadow shivers and flutters like the flame on the wallpaper, as if trying to come to life - now I think of Hans Andersen and his tale of the shadow. And it seems to me I am the shadow who wished to become a man.\" </p> <p> \u00a9 OW Toad, 2000. </p> <p> <strong> John Irving</strong><br> The Headmaster's Papers by Richard A Hawley </p> <p> The Headmaster's Papers, a novel by Richard A Hawley, was first published in 1983 by a small, independent publisher in Middlebury, Vermont - Paul S Eriksson. At the time, the author was himself a headmaster; he was a teacher and the director of the upper school division of the University School, an independent school in Cleveland, Ohio. The Headmaster's Papers is an epistolary novel - a form I much admire, chiefly for the difficulty of writing a novel with such a limited structure. The best writer of fiction in the epistolary form is Alice Munro, and I told Alice once that two things prevented me from trying to write an epistolary novel, which I have long been tempted to do.</p> <p> One is that Alice has already written better in this form than anyone likely will, and two is that Richard A Hawley wrote The Headmaster's Papers, an epistolary novel so heartbreaking that no one is likely to surpass its emotional effect in letter form. I sent a copy of the novel to Alice; she liked it very much. We had a further conversation about epistolary novels, and I told her that I thought Hawley's novel was so moving that he establishes a virtual rule for future epistolary novels: namely, the last letter in the novel has to be a suicide note.</p> <p> Nothing else will do. The Headmaster's Papers is entirely composed of one man's letters - John Greeve's, the suffering headmaster at an all-boys' private school. His name is well-chosen. In Hawley's journal, before he began the novel, he wrote: \"Imagine a good man whose props have fallen away.\" That is John Greeve - a very good man, whose life has been to guide others but who finds himself, in his middle 50s, rudderless and at sea. His letters are to friends, to the angry parents of boys dismissed from school, to his own son - lost to drugs and wandering in Europe, or (the reader presumes) most likely dead. </p> <p>Also, included among Greeve's \"papers\" are his public addresses to the boys and faculty of his school, and his heartfelt (occasionally too heartfelt) poems, which he submits to various small magazines. From his letters, we see how impossibly \"good\" Greeve's standards are; we also see his own efforts to maintain himself, with dignity and grace, slipping. His wife is dying of cancer. When she dies, Greeve gives up. In his last letter to his lost son, Greeve writes: \"We are forever in the stands, kid. Sorry.\" In his suicide notes, to old friends, he writes: \"This is not a tragedy. I am used up.\" But he's wrong; The Headmaster's Papers is a tragedy, a fine one. I implied earlier that the last letter in Hawley's novel is a suicide note, but this isn't exactly true - the suicide note is next to last. The last letter is a kind of PS to the suicide note, or a different kind of suicide note from the first one - call it suicide note number two. Greeve submits a poem to his school's quarterly magazine.</p> <p> To the editor, he writes: \"I know we don't print poems as a rule, but since there will be no Headmaster's Letter, maybe you could work it in.\" The poem itself is one of John Greeve's best, the closing lines of which can be read as suicide note number three. \"A bright road opening wide to me Ghost children chanting something About verbs They are cheering in waves Hymns from voices clear and sad And gone as bells Hurrying bells, evening bells School bells banging me back To school.\" </p> <p> Back in 1983, the novel received a fair amount of well-deserved attention - especially for a first novel, and for a small-press publication. The Boston Globe compared Hawley to Louis Auchincloss, and Mr Auchincloss himself wrote in praise of the novel - as did I: \"The headmaster is a character ripe with nobility, and with personal failure and hopelessness,\" I wrote. \"Mr Hawley has the poise and vision of a writer who can create a whole world.\" </p> <p>It was successful enough to merit a paperback sale - to Bantam, in 1984. And in 1992 Eriksson published a revised paperback edition of the novel, with a foreword and afterword by the author. Both are interesting but unnecessary; the novel works best all by itself. Whatever narrative limitations are imposed on an epistolary novel, The Headmaster's Papers demonstrates that a good man's suffering can be felt in his letters as keenly as in any other form of storytelling. </p> <p> \u00a9 John Irving, 2000.

But I have a clear memory of a Saturday in the summer of 1990, during a year when I tried to live one month in Dublin followed by one month in Barcelona and managed not to live much at all, but spent my time oddly disentangled, disengaged, suspended. And the book hit me hard. </p> <p>I remember late on a Saturday night, in a tiny room in a flat near Santa Maria del Mar, realising that if I did not put this book down I would finish it that night, and when I woke in the morning I would not have it. I put it aside and slept and then woke with the absolute and uncomplicated pleasure you normally get from finding a delightful and half-forgotten bloke in bed beside you. I started reading again and I am still recovering, in certain ways, from what I learned.</p> <p> The book is Juan Goytisolo's memoir Forbidden Territory, which was published in hardback by Quartet in England. I don't know if it ever made it to a paperback. Goytisolo was brought up in bourgeois Barcelona, where the upper middle classes have remained undisturbed for a hundred and fifty years. Neither world war, nor the Spanish civil war have had much impact on them, except to make them conservative in ways that are almost exquisite. </p> <p> As a child, Goytisolo was sexually interfered with by his grandfather, and as an adult, he is determined that the sort of sexual repression which led to this will not govern his life, but rather become the source of his liberation. His mother Julia Gay was killed by a bomb during the civil war when he was a small boy (he was born in 1931) and that sorrow and a strange guilt, as anyone who has lost a parent in childhood will know, follow him everywhere. He goes, as all good Catalans go, to Paris and there he meets Jean Genet who asks him straight out if he is a homosexual. </p> <p>Goytisolo is a provincial; his editor Monique Lange, who will be his lover for many years, is also in the room. He cannot answer; he hesitates. Maybe he is a homosexual. And later he tells us that at the time of writing the book he spends half the year with a working-class Moroccan man. It is complicated, so he cannot answer straight, but he feels shame about this, and Genet has no more time for fear and shame and prevarication. </p> <p>I love the dark truths which Goytisolo is prepared to explore in the book. He is the boy who suffers alienation from family and Catalan society, who suddenly realises that, elsewhere, alienation - it is Paris in the 50s - has become the new enlightenment. But this is not a cure, merely an explanation and, at times, a comfort. The damaged self is alone in this book; the aim of the journey is to know and explore the damage because it cannot be repaired. Things must be faced, and this is something I wish I could come to terms with. Goytisolo realised that the enemy lingers in the language itself, and that language remains, no matter who else has used it, a soft wax when you are alone in a room with it. </p> <p>His novels are a great roar against the Spanish tradition since 1492, against grammar and syntax, as much as inherited boundaries and notions of culture and civilisation. The first volume of his memoirs set the context for this: he is uncompromising and honest not about the things which it is easy to be uncompromising and honest about - Franco's Spain, bourgeois life - but about the forbidden territory of the self, the things we wish to keep hidden. </p> <p> \u00a9 Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, 2000. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Ondaatje </strong><br> Bringing Tony Home by Tissa Abeysekara</p> <p> When I first read Bringing Tony Home three years ago, it felt as if I had come across a book from my childhood, one I already knew well. It was of course my childhood I had come across, found evoked - with that strange, exaggerated sense of description (\"as the woman disappeared inside the house I noticed she was frighteningly thin and flat like a steamroller had gone over her\"), and enlarged sense of things, such as a too-heavy jug one was supposed to carry a great distance.</p> <p> The book had the delicious sad sense of being a solitary in the world, with a thousand intricacies between you and your closest neighbour or relative. Bringing Tony Home was written in 1996 and is not a \"lost classic\", but I had the sense of having found one. Something about the way it was written, was slipped by accident into my hands, something about its quick disappearance and, in fact, its non-appearance in the West, made it one. </p> <p>\"In the last years of the forties, when I had still not reached ten years of age, my family became desperately poor.\" So begins Bringing Tony Home.</p> <p> The author, Tissa Abeysekara, is a contemporary Sri Lankan film-maker who in mid-life wrote this first novella or memoir about a disappearing moment from his childhood. It is a book written by someone roughly my age, about a mutual era of childhood. I had, till reading it, never found a book with such a physical echo of my life in Sri Lanka. Usually, I transpose the location and setting in any novel about childhood that I read so I can fit the events into a familiar place. </p> <p>For instance, as a boy in Sri Lanka I knew only one house with a staircase and so for many years whenever anyone in a novel climbed or descended the stairs, whether a Karamazov or the Count of Monte Cristo, they did so in my Aunt Nedra's house. So Tissa Abeysekara's slim novel about a childhood loss took me right to the place of my youth. Not just to Sri Lanka, not just to Colombo, but specifically to the High Level Road in Boralesgamuwa. And there, in a place I knew and could recognise - and could slip into without translation - I was introduced to the people in his boyhood story, coloured and altered by the 40 years of the author's adult life. </p> <p> It is a simple story about a family that has to move because of a change in fortune and in doing so, it becomes necessary to leave behind the family dog. The boy, a week later, returns on his own to the village to look for \"Tony\", and because of the narrator's smallness and because of the \"largeness\" of the world around him, the journey he makes is mythic. \"The glass smelled vaguely of sardine and the water tasted like when it is taken from a galvanised bucket, but I drank it all in one breath and returned the glass to the woman with both hands...\" </p> <p> I feel that already I am simplifying a privately heard tale. It is a book I wish to share only by passing it over to a reader. Funny and tender. Dangerous. Unfair. And, of course, it is one of the saddest stories. What is wonderful is the way Abeysekara can make a whole era hang on a single strand of memory: </p> <p>\"Each year during the April season a giant wheel would be constructed in Depanama and it would be there till after Wesak; this year they were constructing it on the little hill overlooking the Pannipitiya Railway Station where, once upon a time there was a tennis court, and every Saturday Father would come in the evening to play tennis with Messrs Arthur Kotelawala, Bulner, Subasingha, and the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, and I would sit perched on the embankment by the cactus bushes with Guneris the servant boy and watch the trains come and go in the station below, and during the Sri Pada season which was from early January to late May, the trains were full of pilgrims and white cloth fluttered like bird feathers from the windows, sheaths of areacanut pods bristled, voices chanted and along with it the iron wheels of the train braked, clanged and screeched all blending together in perfect harmony and held together by the sad melancholy whistle of the train as it left the station and behind was the sound of the tennis ball hitting the racquet the ground or the net in a soft but clear and varying rhythm...</p> <p> \"Then one by one they stopped playing; Mr Subasingha disappeared because - I heard my mother and father whispering to each other - his wife had run away with a Tamil gentleman who was the Apothecary at the local government dispensary; Mr Kotelawala had a stroke and was ordered complete rest; the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, started drinking during the day also and was too drunk by evening to play tennis, and old Mr Bulner simply stopped playing. </p> <p>We moved from the big house to the small one at Depanama and Father had no time to play for he left early in the morning on a bicycle and would return late at night even on Saturdays, and sometimes he would be gone for days. And the tennis court was abandoned and weeds grew all over it and the iron roller that used to level the court was dragged by some village boys to the top of the little hill and rolled down where it ended in a ditch and lay there like a broken animal.\"</p> <p> The portrait of the world is farcical and formal in the way the author insists on giving us a torrent of details and names and everyone's official role, for children know and remember the labels on adults: the Apothecary, the Station Master. Because it is these details of society in his memory, blending together in perfect harmony, that once held his childhood society together. But the habits of parents, the memories of public fights, disappear and are discovered to be mutable - so it is a book not just of a child dealing with the loss of one dear dog, but of everything, the whole world that surrounds his life. </p> <p>Accordingly, the descriptions are detailed and frantic, an aria of lists that tries to hold the past together - in the way that the adult film-maker in a subliminal subplot continues to make films, now in this region. </p> <p>\"Forty-five years later I killed myself trying to capture something of this atmosphere in the opening scene of Pitagamkarayo, and the paddy field on which the final sequence was staged was the very same paddy field.\" The tragedy within the book is not the loss of the animal per se , but the boy's awareness that he must in the end leave it. He is being forced to turn into an adult, which is the deeper sadness in this story. On a second reading we realise that the boy in the story is looking back, so that contemporary opinions and events also flood in within this \"slight\" story, told in double time with young and with adult eyes:</p> <p> \"By eleven o'clock I had finished my assignments: rations from the coop store - the smelly yellowy big grained milchard; six chundus of it at two per coupon, sugar; brown sticky and smelling faintly like stale bees' honey: three pounds of it, Dhal: the variety referred to as 'Mysoor parippu', fine-grained and pink and mistakenly believed to be coming from Mysore in India and boycotted under the orders of the JVP when the Indian Peace Keeping Force was alleged to be raping girls in Jaffna in the late eighties until someone enlightened us that the dhal had nothing to do with India and was really 'Masoor Dhal' which came from Turkey...\" </p> <p> We hold onto favourite books for reasons that are not universal. Each word and sentence in this one carried me into arms I'd been in before. No other book brings me as close to my lost self. It is a lost classic for me, too, because of this book's quick fate. Published in Sri Lanka by a small press, it has so far not been published anywhere else. It was a story written far from the publishing centres of the West, and there it remains, still lost to the rest of the world. </p> <p>\u00a9 Michael Ondaatje, 2000.

ISBN 955-96434-0-1, priced 200 rupees. </p> <p> <strong> Edmund White </strong> <br> The story of Harold by Terry Andrews </p> <p>This is one of the strangest books I've ever read, probably because it combines elements that have never before or since appeared together. When the book first came out in 1974 it created a minor sensation and then immediately sank out of sight, never to be reprinted, as far as I know. </p> <p>Certainly it is now out of print. \"Terry Andrews\" is apparently a pen name and though I once heard the real name of the author (someone who in fact was a celebrated children's book writer of the period), I've since forgotten it and I understand he is long since dead. The novel is recounted by a first-person narrator, named \"Terry\", who is a New York children's book author who penned an instant classic, The Story Of Harold, which he reads frequently to a group of kiddies. </p> <p>Harold is a minuscule man who wears a checked vest and a bowler hat, possesses minor magic powers that can change some things but not all, and writes spontaneous poems that sometimes work as spells. Terry is a hard-drinking, sadistic, death-infatuated bisexual who is a star of the wife-swapping orgy circuit, who has a respectable girlfriend, Anne, and who has two main boyfriends.</p> <p> One is Jim Whittaker, a handsome, cold-hearted egotist, a pushy masochist who drops in on Terry whenever he feels like a roughing up. He's eager to be manhandled and thrashed - but no marks, please, since he must go home to his wife and six children. His children, of course, are all enormous Harold fans, and Terry gets invited to the Whittakers' for Thanksgiving so that he will fill the kids in on still-unpublished episodes in Harold's adventurous life. Harold's biggest admirer is Jim's handsome, blind son, Ben. </p> <p> Although Terry is profoundly in love with Jim, Jim is abundantly clear about his own basic indifference to Terry - a friend, hot sex, nothing more. Terry's other \"slave\" is Dan Reilly, a \"fire freak\" who wants Terry to handcuff him to a stake and burn him alive; in fact, Dan has bought an isolated little house in the suburbs just so this erotic death can be accomplished in privacy. And Dan has carefully constructed his funeral pyre in anticipation of Terry's visit (he's even thoughtfully provided the matches). </p> <p>That's what I mean by an unusual (unprecedented) combination of elements. The narration, in the form of Terry's diary, alternates among accounts of an evening with Anne at the opera (Die Frau Ohne Schatten), a cozy luncheon at the museum between Terry and Jim Whittaker's wife (during which they discuss Jim's human failings), an acrobatic evening with the swingers (the year is 1974, after all), an evening of beating and cigarette burns with Dan Reilly, a hearty, friendly exchange with Terry's loveable cleaning lady... </p> <p>Strangest of all are the scenes with Bernard, an impossible, unloveable lump of a little boy whose mother has begged Terry to spend some time with him every so often. Bernard loves only one thing in the world, The Story Of Harold, and Terry is able to encode life lessons for Bernard in further tales of the tiny figure. Even more bizarrely, Terry talks about the perverted corners of his own nocturnal life in the twee terms of a children's story. There are faults in this book - it's about fifty pages too long, it has a sentimental ending, the tone seldom strays from an exalted, almost giddy despair.</p> <p> But it is a fearless performance. The narrator's tone (derived, one suspects, from Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) smoothly negotiates its way through all the motley elements. And though \"Terry\" is a bisexual and a shockingly far-out sadist, nevertheless this novel is the earliest document that renders the feel of Downtown Village gay life in the 1970s - the mix of high culture and perverse sex, the sudden transformation, say, from a night at the opera to an early morning at the baths, the bohemian indifference to bourgeois comfort or even cleanliness, the Sade-like conviction that sexual urges are to be elaborated rather than psychoanalysed, a complete silence regarding national politics (one would never know this novel was written in the last throes of the Vietnam war), and an enthralled focus on personal destiny. The gym is already a part of the single man's life, as is the apartment that is little more than a trick pad. And a life of sex does not in any way preclude a nearly Wagnerian passion (for Jim Whittaker): </p> <p> \"He genuinely loves his wife. At least he must, the amount of sex they make together. He's told me about that, and doesn't lie. (God, I wish that one time he had!) In fact - all you my witnesses - he's described their married life in intimate detail. Among other pleasures on the mental rack, I've been made a confidant... And he simply adores his kids. I'd like him for that. If there were any seashore left in the storm of emotions I felt for him.</p> <p> \"I'd say I'd like him - but the truth within the truth is I love him just for that! The fact that he is an excellent father, a pretty good husband - despite how much he fucks around - those things are what allure me most - they've magnetised me like iron toward his life: the things that make it impossible for me to be anything at all except some casual sex for him... </p> <p>Terry Andrews - the living dildo, the living whip - that's me!\" All the stylistic tricks are here - the voice that interrupts and corrects itself, the demotic-hieratic vocabulary (\"fucks around\" in the same sentence with \"magnetised\"), the exclamations as asides in parentheses buried in an otherwise matter-of-fact sentence. This is the voice of the first gay liberation generation: romantic and sexual, unguilty and explicit, non-judgmental and appreciative, grittily urban and, at the same time, operatic and verging on hysterical self-dramatising. To me, The Story Of Harold is a remarkable period piece that reminds us that the 1970s was a period far more sophisticated and humane than our own \u00a9 Edmund White, 2000. </p> <p> \u0095 These essays are extracted from Lost Classics, edited by Michael Ondaatje, Michael Redhill, Esta Spalding and Linda Spalding, published by Bloomsbury on March 5, at \u00a314.99.

      "bodyText": "Margaret Atwood Doctor Glas by Hjalmar S\u00f6dberg \"Now I sit at my open window, writing - for whom? Not for any friend or mistress. Scarcely for myself, even. I do not read today what I wrote yesterday; nor shall I read this tomorrow. I write simply so my hand can move, my thoughts move of their own accord. I write to kill a sleepless hour. Why can't I sleep? After all, I've committed no crime.\" This short, astonishing novel arrived in the mail a couple of years ago, sent by Swedish friends who ferret in secondhand bookstores in search of Swedish books in translation which they think I might like. They were spot-on with this one. Doctor Glas was first published in 1905 and caused a scandal then, in Sweden, for reasons that had to do with its handling of those two scandalous items, sex and death - not to mention their sub-sets, abortion and euthanasia. The version I have is a tattered paperback from 1970, a reissue of a 1963 translation - published I suppose to coincide with a film based on it, directed incidentally by Mai Zetterling. On the back of my copy are various encomiums, from the Observer, the Guardian, the Sunday Telegraph, the Glasgow Herald -\"a masterpiece\", \"the most remarkable book of the year\", and so forth. Still, as far as I know, Doctor Glas has long been out of print, at least in its English version. The narrator of Doctor Glas is Doctor Glas, a thirtyish man whose journal we hypocrites lecteurs read over his shoulder as he composes it. His is the remarkable yet unnervingly familiar voice we follow in its reflections, its prevarications, its self-denunciations, its boredoms, its wistfulness, its lyrical praises or splenetic denunciations of the weather. A romantic idealist turned solitary and sad, afflicted with fin-de-si\u00e8cle malaise, pestered by thoughts of Darwin and duty, Baudelaire and escapism, the longing for love and action, and the sceptical inertia of his age, unable to fall in love except with women who are in love with someone else, infested by his own unconscious - of which he is fitfully conscious - he offers both the candid transparency and the narcissism his surname would suggest. However, it's no accident that his second name is Gabriel, for he is tempted to play Angel of Life to a beautiful woman who arrives at his surgery one day begging for his help. Ignorant of what marriage entails, she has allowed herself to be pawned off on a \"respectable\" but morally and physically loathsome clergyman. The help she wants from Glas is freedom from this troll's sexual attentions, which she finds repugnant in the extreme - especially since she is having an affair with another man. Doctor Glas takes pity on her and invents a disease for her, and lies to the husband about it for her sake. Thus it begins. Angels can of course be angels of death as well as of life, and doctors are very conveniently situated for this role. I won't spoil the plot by telling what happens next, but it's a cunning triple-tied knot. Doctor Glas is deeply unsettling, in the way certain dreams are - or, no coincidence, certain films by Bergman, who must have read it. It moves from the sordid to the banal to the anxiously surreal to the visionary with economy and impressive style. A few years earlier and it would never have been published; a few years later and it would have been dubbed a forerunner of stream-of-consciousness. It occurs on the cusp of our century, opening doors we've been opening ever since. \"And now, as I sit at my open window, writing this by a flickering candle - I detest touching oil lamps and my housekeeper is sleeping too soundly after her funeral coffee and cakes for me to have the heart to wake her - now, as the candleflame flutters in the draught and my shadow shivers and flutters like the flame on the wallpaper, as if trying to come to life - now I think of Hans Andersen and his tale of the shadow. And it seems to me I am the shadow who wished to become a man.\" \u00a9 OW Toad, 2000. John Irving The Headmaster's Papers by Richard A Hawley The Headmaster's Papers, a novel by Richard A Hawley, was first published in 1983 by a small, independent publisher in Middlebury, Vermont - Paul S Eriksson. At the time, the author was himself a headmaster; he was a teacher and the director of the upper school division of the University School, an independent school in Cleveland, Ohio. The Headmaster's Papers is an epistolary novel - a form I much admire, chiefly for the difficulty of writing a novel with such a limited structure. The best writer of fiction in the epistolary form is Alice Munro, and I told Alice once that two things prevented me from trying to write an epistolary novel, which I have long been tempted to do. One is that Alice has already written better in this form than anyone likely will, and two is that Richard A Hawley wrote The Headmaster's Papers, an epistolary novel so heartbreaking that no one is likely to surpass its emotional effect in letter form. I sent a copy of the novel to Alice; she liked it very much. We had a further conversation about epistolary novels, and I told her that I thought Hawley's novel was so moving that he establishes a virtual rule for future epistolary novels: namely, the last letter in the novel has to be a suicide note. Nothing else will do. The Headmaster's Papers is entirely composed of one man's letters - John Greeve's, the suffering headmaster at an all-boys' private school. His name is well-chosen. In Hawley's journal, before he began the novel, he wrote: \"Imagine a good man whose props have fallen away.\" That is John Greeve - a very good man, whose life has been to guide others but who finds himself, in his middle 50s, rudderless and at sea. His letters are to friends, to the angry parents of boys dismissed from school, to his own son - lost to drugs and wandering in Europe, or (the reader presumes) most likely dead. Also, included among Greeve's \"papers\" are his public addresses to the boys and faculty of his school, and his heartfelt (occasionally too heartfelt) poems, which he submits to various small magazines. From his letters, we see how impossibly \"good\" Greeve's standards are; we also see his own efforts to maintain himself, with dignity and grace, slipping. His wife is dying of cancer. When she dies, Greeve gives up. In his last letter to his lost son, Greeve writes: \"We are forever in the stands, kid. Sorry.\" In his suicide notes, to old friends, he writes: \"This is not a tragedy. I am used up.\" But he's wrong; The Headmaster's Papers is a tragedy, a fine one. I implied earlier that the last letter in Hawley's novel is a suicide note, but this isn't exactly true - the suicide note is next to last. The last letter is a kind of PS to the suicide note, or a different kind of suicide note from the first one - call it suicide note number two. Greeve submits a poem to his school's quarterly magazine. To the editor, he writes: \"I know we don't print poems as a rule, but since there will be no Headmaster's Letter, maybe you could work it in.\" The poem itself is one of John Greeve's best, the closing lines of which can be read as suicide note number three. \"A bright road opening wide to me Ghost children chanting something About verbs They are cheering in waves Hymns from voices clear and sad And gone as bells Hurrying bells, evening bells School bells banging me back To school.\" Back in 1983, the novel received a fair amount of well-deserved attention - especially for a first novel, and for a small-press publication. The Boston Globe compared Hawley to Louis Auchincloss, and Mr Auchincloss himself wrote in praise of the novel - as did I: \"The headmaster is a character ripe with nobility, and with personal failure and hopelessness,\" I wrote. \"Mr Hawley has the poise and vision of a writer who can create a whole world.\" It was successful enough to merit a paperback sale - to Bantam, in 1984. And in 1992 Eriksson published a revised paperback edition of the novel, with a foreword and afterword by the author. Both are interesting but unnecessary; the novel works best all by itself. Whatever narrative limitations are imposed on an epistolary novel, The Headmaster's Papers demonstrates that a good man's suffering can be felt in his letters as keenly as in any other form of storytelling. \u00a9 John Irving, 2000.

Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn Forbidden Territory by Juan Goytisolo I cannot find the book, and the two or three people to whom I might have lent it have no memory of it, have never heard of it. But I have a clear memory of a Saturday in the summer of 1990, during a year when I tried to live one month in Dublin followed by one month in Barcelona and managed not to live much at all, but spent my time oddly disentangled, disengaged, suspended. And the book hit me hard. I remember late on a Saturday night, in a tiny room in a flat near Santa Maria del Mar, realising that if I did not put this book down I would finish it that night, and when I woke in the morning I would not have it. I put it aside and slept and then woke with the absolute and uncomplicated pleasure you normally get from finding a delightful and half-forgotten bloke in bed beside you. I started reading again and I am still recovering, in certain ways, from what I learned. The book is Juan Goytisolo's memoir Forbidden Territory, which was published in hardback by Quartet in England. I don't know if it ever made it to a paperback. Goytisolo was brought up in bourgeois Barcelona, where the upper middle classes have remained undisturbed for a hundred and fifty years. Neither world war, nor the Spanish civil war have had much impact on them, except to make them conservative in ways that are almost exquisite. As a child, Goytisolo was sexually interfered with by his grandfather, and as an adult, he is determined that the sort of sexual repression which led to this will not govern his life, but rather become the source of his liberation. His mother Julia Gay was killed by a bomb during the civil war when he was a small boy (he was born in 1931) and that sorrow and a strange guilt, as anyone who has lost a parent in childhood will know, follow him everywhere. He goes, as all good Catalans go, to Paris and there he meets Jean Genet who asks him straight out if he is a homosexual. Goytisolo is a provincial; his editor Monique Lange, who will be his lover for many years, is also in the room. He cannot answer; he hesitates. Maybe he is a homosexual. And later he tells us that at the time of writing the book he spends half the year with a working-class Moroccan man. It is complicated, so he cannot answer straight, but he feels shame about this, and Genet has no more time for fear and shame and prevarication. I love the dark truths which Goytisolo is prepared to explore in the book. He is the boy who suffers alienation from family and Catalan society, who suddenly realises that, elsewhere, alienation - it is Paris in the 50s - has become the new enlightenment. But this is not a cure, merely an explanation and, at times, a comfort. The damaged self is alone in this book; the aim of the journey is to know and explore the damage because it cannot be repaired. Things must be faced, and this is something I wish I could come to terms with. Goytisolo realised that the enemy lingers in the language itself, and that language remains, no matter who else has used it, a soft wax when you are alone in a room with it. His novels are a great roar against the Spanish tradition since 1492, against grammar and syntax, as much as inherited boundaries and notions of culture and civilisation. The first volume of his memoirs set the context for this: he is uncompromising and honest not about the things which it is easy to be uncompromising and honest about - Franco's Spain, bourgeois life - but about the forbidden territory of the self, the things we wish to keep hidden. \u00a9 Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, 2000. Michael Ondaatje Bringing Tony Home by Tissa Abeysekara When I first read Bringing Tony Home three years ago, it felt as if I had come across a book from my childhood, one I already knew well. It was of course my childhood I had come across, found evoked - with that strange, exaggerated sense of description (\"as the woman disappeared inside the house I noticed she was frighteningly thin and flat like a steamroller had gone over her\"), and enlarged sense of things, such as a too-heavy jug one was supposed to carry a great distance. The book had the delicious sad sense of being a solitary in the world, with a thousand intricacies between you and your closest neighbour or relative. Bringing Tony Home was written in 1996 and is not a \"lost classic\", but I had the sense of having found one. Something about the way it was written, was slipped by accident into my hands, something about its quick disappearance and, in fact, its non-appearance in the West, made it one. \"In the last years of the forties, when I had still not reached ten years of age, my family became desperately poor.\" So begins Bringing Tony Home. The author, Tissa Abeysekara, is a contemporary Sri Lankan film-maker who in mid-life wrote this first novella or memoir about a disappearing moment from his childhood. It is a book written by someone roughly my age, about a mutual era of childhood. I had, till reading it, never found a book with such a physical echo of my life in Sri Lanka. Usually, I transpose the location and setting in any novel about childhood that I read so I can fit the events into a familiar place. For instance, as a boy in Sri Lanka I knew only one house with a staircase and so for many years whenever anyone in a novel climbed or descended the stairs, whether a Karamazov or the Count of Monte Cristo, they did so in my Aunt Nedra's house. So Tissa Abeysekara's slim novel about a childhood loss took me right to the place of my youth. Not just to Sri Lanka, not just to Colombo, but specifically to the High Level Road in Boralesgamuwa. And there, in a place I knew and could recognise - and could slip into without translation - I was introduced to the people in his boyhood story, coloured and altered by the 40 years of the author's adult life. It is a simple story about a family that has to move because of a change in fortune and in doing so, it becomes necessary to leave behind the family dog. The boy, a week later, returns on his own to the village to look for \"Tony\", and because of the narrator's smallness and because of the \"largeness\" of the world around him, the journey he makes is mythic. \"The glass smelled vaguely of sardine and the water tasted like when it is taken from a galvanised bucket, but I drank it all in one breath and returned the glass to the woman with both hands...\" I feel that already I am simplifying a privately heard tale. It is a book I wish to share only by passing it over to a reader. Funny and tender. Dangerous. Unfair. And, of course, it is one of the saddest stories. What is wonderful is the way Abeysekara can make a whole era hang on a single strand of memory: \"Each year during the April season a giant wheel would be constructed in Depanama and it would be there till after Wesak; this year they were constructing it on the little hill overlooking the Pannipitiya Railway Station where, once upon a time there was a tennis court, and every Saturday Father would come in the evening to play tennis with Messrs Arthur Kotelawala, Bulner, Subasingha, and the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, and I would sit perched on the embankment by the cactus bushes with Guneris the servant boy and watch the trains come and go in the station below, and during the Sri Pada season which was from early January to late May, the trains were full of pilgrims and white cloth fluttered like bird feathers from the windows, sheaths of areacanut pods bristled, voices chanted and along with it the iron wheels of the train braked, clanged and screeched all blending together in perfect harmony and held together by the sad melancholy whistle of the train as it left the station and behind was the sound of the tennis ball hitting the racquet the ground or the net in a soft but clear and varying rhythm... \"Then one by one they stopped playing; Mr Subasingha disappeared because - I heard my mother and father whispering to each other - his wife had run away with a Tamil gentleman who was the Apothecary at the local government dispensary; Mr Kotelawala had a stroke and was ordered complete rest; the Station Master, Mr Samarasinha, started drinking during the day also and was too drunk by evening to play tennis, and old Mr Bulner simply stopped playing. We moved from the big house to the small one at Depanama and Father had no time to play for he left early in the morning on a bicycle and would return late at night even on Saturdays, and sometimes he would be gone for days. And the tennis court was abandoned and weeds grew all over it and the iron roller that used to level the court was dragged by some village boys to the top of the little hill and rolled down where it ended in a ditch and lay there like a broken animal.\" The portrait of the world is farcical and formal in the way the author insists on giving us a torrent of details and names and everyone's official role, for children know and remember the labels on adults: the Apothecary, the Station Master. Because it is these details of society in his memory, blending together in perfect harmony, that once held his childhood society together. But the habits of parents, the memories of public fights, disappear and are discovered to be mutable - so it is a book not just of a child dealing with the loss of one dear dog, but of everything, the whole world that surrounds his life. Accordingly, the descriptions are detailed and frantic, an aria of lists that tries to hold the past together - in the way that the adult film-maker in a subliminal subplot continues to make films, now in this region. \"Forty-five years later I killed myself trying to capture something of this atmosphere in the opening scene of Pitagamkarayo, and the paddy field on which the final sequence was staged was the very same paddy field.\" The tragedy within the book is not the loss of the animal per se , but the boy's awareness that he must in the end leave it. He is being forced to turn into an adult, which is the deeper sadness in this story. On a second reading we realise that the boy in the story is looking back, so that contemporary opinions and events also flood in within this \"slight\" story, told in double time with young and with adult eyes: \"By eleven o'clock I had finished my assignments: rations from the coop store - the smelly yellowy big grained milchard; six chundus of it at two per coupon, sugar; brown sticky and smelling faintly like stale bees' honey: three pounds of it, Dhal: the variety referred to as 'Mysoor parippu', fine-grained and pink and mistakenly believed to be coming from Mysore in India and boycotted under the orders of the JVP when the Indian Peace Keeping Force was alleged to be raping girls in Jaffna in the late eighties until someone enlightened us that the dhal had nothing to do with India and was really 'Masoor Dhal' which came from Turkey...\" We hold onto favourite books for reasons that are not universal. Each word and sentence in this one carried me into arms I'd been in before. No other book brings me as close to my lost self. It is a lost classic for me, too, because of this book's quick fate. Published in Sri Lanka by a small press, it has so far not been published anywhere else. It was a story written far from the publishing centres of the West, and there it remains, still lost to the rest of the world. \u00a9 Michael Ondaatje, 2000. Forbidden Territory, Sri Lanka, 1988.

Edmund White The story of Harold by Terry Andrews This is one of the strangest books I've ever read, probably because it combines elements that have never before or since appeared together. When the book first came out in 1974 it created a minor sensation and then immediately sank out of sight, never to be reprinted, as far as I know. Certainly it is now out of print. \"Terry Andrews\" is apparently a pen name and though I once heard the real name of the author (someone who in fact was a celebrated children's book writer of the period), I've since forgotten it and I understand he is long since dead. The novel is recounted by a first-person narrator, named \"Terry\", who is a New York children's book author who penned an instant classic, The Story Of Harold, which he reads frequently to a group of kiddies. Harold is a minuscule man who wears a checked vest and a bowler hat, possesses minor magic powers that can change some things but not all, and writes spontaneous poems that sometimes work as spells. Terry is a hard-drinking, sadistic, death-infatuated bisexual who is a star of the wife-swapping orgy circuit, who has a respectable girlfriend, Anne, and who has two main boyfriends. One is Jim Whittaker, a handsome, cold-hearted egotist, a pushy masochist who drops in on Terry whenever he feels like a roughing up. He's eager to be manhandled and thrashed - but no marks, please, since he must go home to his wife and six children. His children, of course, are all enormous Harold fans, and Terry gets invited to the Whittakers' for Thanksgiving so that he will fill the kids in on still-unpublished episodes in Harold's adventurous life. Harold's biggest admirer is Jim's handsome, blind son, Ben. Although Terry is profoundly in love with Jim, Jim is abundantly clear about his own basic indifference to Terry - a friend, hot sex, nothing more. Terry's other \"slave\" is Dan Reilly, a \"fire freak\" who wants Terry to handcuff him to a stake and burn him alive; in fact, Dan has bought an isolated little house in the suburbs just so this erotic death can be accomplished in privacy. And Dan has carefully constructed his funeral pyre in anticipation of Terry's visit (he's even thoughtfully provided the matches). That's what I mean by an unusual (unprecedented) combination of elements. The narration, in the form of Terry's diary, alternates among accounts of an evening with Anne at the opera (Die Frau Ohne Schatten), a cozy luncheon at the museum between Terry and Jim Whittaker's wife (during which they discuss Jim's human failings), an acrobatic evening with the swingers (the year is 1974, after all), an evening of beating and cigarette burns with Dan Reilly, a hearty, friendly exchange with Terry's loveable cleaning lady... Strangest of all are the scenes with Bernard, an impossible, unloveable lump of a little boy whose mother has begged Terry to spend some time with him every so often. Bernard loves only one thing in the world, The Story Of Harold, and Terry is able to encode life lessons for Bernard in further tales of the tiny figure. Even more bizarrely, Terry talks about the perverted corners of his own nocturnal life in the twee terms of a children's story. There are faults in this book - it's about fifty pages too long, it has a sentimental ending, the tone seldom strays from an exalted, almost giddy despair. But it is a fearless performance. The narrator's tone (derived, one suspects, from Nabokov's Humbert Humbert) smoothly negotiates its way through all the motley elements. And though \"Terry\" is a bisexual and a shockingly far-out sadist, nevertheless this novel is the earliest document that renders the feel of Downtown Village gay life in the 1970s - the mix of high culture and perverse sex, the sudden transformation, say, from a night at the opera to an early morning at the baths, the bohemian indifference to bourgeois comfort or even cleanliness, the Sade-like conviction that sexual urges are to be elaborated rather than psychoanalysed, a complete silence regarding national politics (one would never know this novel was written in the last throes of the Vietnam war), and an enthralled focus on personal destiny. The gym is already a part of the single man's life, as is the apartment that is little more than a trick pad. And a life of sex does not in any way preclude a nearly Wagnerian passion (for Jim Whittaker): \"He genuinely loves his wife. At least he must, the amount of sex they make together. He's told me about that, and doesn't lie. (God, I wish that one time he had!) In fact - all you my witnesses - he's described their married life in intimate detail. Among other pleasures on the mental rack, I've been made a confidant... And he simply adores his kids. I'd like him for that. If there were any seashore left in the storm of emotions I felt for him. \"I'd say I'd like him - but the truth within the truth is I love him just for that! The fact that he is an excellent father, a pretty good husband - despite how much he fucks around - those things are what allure me most - they've magnetised me like iron toward his life: the things that make it impossible for me to be anything at all except some casual sex for him... Terry Andrews - the living dildo, the living whip - that's me!\" All the stylistic tricks are here - the voice that interrupts and corrects itself, the demotic-hieratic vocabulary (\"fucks around\" in the same sentence with \"magnetised\"), the exclamations as asides in parentheses buried in an otherwise matter-of-fact sentence. This is the voice of the first gay liberation generation: romantic and sexual, unguilty and explicit, non-judgmental and appreciative, grittily urban and, at the same time, operatic and verging on hysterical self-dramatising. To me, The Story Of Harold is a remarkable period piece that reminds us that the 1970s was a period far more sophisticated and humane than our own \u00a9 Edmund White, 2000. \u0095 These essays are extracted from Lost Classics, edited by Michael Ondaatje, Michael Redhill, Esta Spalding and Linda Spalding, published by Bloomsbury on March 5, at \u00a314.99.

They expected that the main political parties, scared of the Francoists, would readily agree to join. But the king took a leading part in suppressing the putsch, and ordered rebel tank units back to barracks.</p> <p>\"It was the king himself who, after realising the nature of the threats to Spain, democracy and the crown ... had proposed to me in 1980 that I might head a government of unity,\" Gen Armada told his prison chaplain shortly after starting his 30-year jail sentence, the book reports.</p> <p>\"I had spoken to the monarch by phone several times and had even visited him,\" Milans del Bosch, who died four years ago, told Martinez Ingles while in prison. \"He always told me I should trust Armada, that the best solution was a government of national unity led by him.\"</p> <p>A royal spokesman at the Zarzuela palace declined to comment yesterday on the allegations, which challenge the accepted story that the king was always clearly opposed to the coup.</p> <p>Additional evidence in the flurry of books published to mark the anniversary suggests that the plotters either misunderstood Juan Carlos or were deliberately misled by the military intelligence service, Cesid.</p> <p>The ambitious Gen Armada, together with an unknown fellow coup leader codenamed White Elephant, was allegedly told by senior Cesid officers that the king would back a coup.</p> <p>\"They persuaded him it was a question of saving the monarchy from a difficult situation,\" the journalist Jesus Palacios claims in his book, The Cesid Coup.</p> <p>Gen Armada's big mistake was to let the fanatical and excitable Col Tejero lead the disorderly assault on the parliament.</p> <p>The plan began to go wrong as soon as Col Tejero, wearing the shiny patent-leather tricorn hat of the civil guard, marched into the packed debating chamber and peppered the ceiling with machine-gun fire.</p> <p>His men failed to make sure that all the television cameras were turned off, thus ensuring that the coup was recorded. More than 300 deputies, from all parties, were held captive for nearly 24 hours.</p> <p>Col Tejero ignored Gen Armada and, instead of negotiating the formation of a government of national unity, demanded the creation of military junta.</p> <p>Newly revealed transcripts of phone conversations between the king and Gen Armada show that, whatever may have been said before, Juan Carlos never wavered in his opposition to the coup once it started.</p> <p>\"Remember, nobody is authorised to do anything in my name,\" he told Gen Armada. It is reported that he told Milans del Bosch that the plotters would have to shoot him first if they wanted to achieve their aims.</p> <p>He ordered other generals not to back the coup, and made a historic television broadcast defending the democratic constitution.

      "bodyText": "The botched Spanish military coup in 1981, dramatically captured on television when Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero Molina stormed parliament, was intended to bolster the rule of King Juan Carlos, according to a book published this week. A former army colonel, Amadeo Martinez Ingles, based The Coup that Never Was on the prison confessions of two of its leaders, who said their mission had been to save the constitutional monarchy. Generals Alfonso Armada and Jaime Milans del Bosch, who were jailed after the attempt, even believed they had the king's explicit backing. Their words have further confused one of the murkiest chapters of recent Spanish history, just as the country prepares for the 20th anniversary next week of an episode which rocked its fledgling democracy. The two monarchist generals claimed that they had acted to prevent even more radical rightwing officers launching their own coup to reinstate a Franco-style military dictatorship and, possibly, send the king into exile. They were sure that Juan Carlos would respond by calling on the aristocratic Gen Armada, his former personal secretary, to lead a government of national unity. They expected that the main political parties, scared of the Francoists, would readily agree to join. But the king took a leading part in suppressing the putsch, and ordered rebel tank units back to barracks. \"It was the king himself who, after realising the nature of the threats to Spain, democracy and the crown ... had proposed to me in 1980 that I might head a government of unity,\" Gen Armada told his prison chaplain shortly after starting his 30-year jail sentence, the book reports. \"I had spoken to the monarch by phone several times and had even visited him,\" Milans del Bosch, who died four years ago, told Martinez Ingles while in prison. \"He always told me I should trust Armada, that the best solution was a government of national unity led by him.\" A royal spokesman at the Zarzuela palace declined to comment yesterday on the allegations, which challenge the accepted story that the king was always clearly opposed to the coup. Additional evidence in the flurry of books published to mark the anniversary suggests that the plotters either misunderstood Juan Carlos or were deliberately misled by the military intelligence service, Cesid. The ambitious Gen Armada, together with an unknown fellow coup leader codenamed White Elephant, was allegedly told by senior Cesid officers that the king would back a coup. \"They persuaded him it was a question of saving the monarchy from a difficult situation,\" the journalist Jesus Palacios claims in his book, The Cesid Coup. Gen Armada's big mistake was to let the fanatical and excitable Col Tejero lead the disorderly assault on the parliament. The plan began to go wrong as soon as Col Tejero, wearing the shiny patent-leather tricorn hat of the civil guard, marched into the packed debating chamber and peppered the ceiling with machine-gun fire. His men failed to make sure that all the television cameras were turned off, thus ensuring that the coup was recorded. More than 300 deputies, from all parties, were held captive for nearly 24 hours. Col Tejero ignored Gen Armada and, instead of negotiating the formation of a government of national unity, demanded the creation of military junta. Newly revealed transcripts of phone conversations between the king and Gen Armada show that, whatever may have been said before, Juan Carlos never wavered in his opposition to the coup once it started. \"Remember, nobody is authorised to do anything in my name,\" he told Gen Armada. It is reported that he told Milans del Bosch that the plotters would have to shoot him first if they wanted to achieve their aims. He ordered other generals not to back the coup, and made a historic television broadcast defending the democratic constitution. In the space of a day the coup crumbled. Col Tejero gave himself up and Gen Armada was soon discovered to have masterminded the plot. The February 23 coup attempt became a turning point for both the king and Spain. Juan Carlos was hailed as the saviour of democracy, and even won the support of republicans, who had resented having the monarchy foisted back on them by Franco when he died in 1975. Eighteen months later a landslide election victory ushered in 13 years of Socialist government under Felipe Gonzalez. Next week United Left party MPs will call for information about all telephone calls to Zarzuela palace on the day of the coup to be made public. \"We do not doubt that the king was against the coup, but we do want to know who White Elephant was,\" the party's spokesman, Joaquin Boj, said. \"There are still things that are not clear about that day.\" Gen Armada, pardoned after serving six years in jail, now grows camellias on his family estate in Galicia, north-west Spain. He still professes absolute loyalty to Juan Carlos. \"The king had to do whatever was most convenient,\" the disgraced general, now 81, explained recently. \"If that meant sacrificing Armada, then so be it.\" Col Tejero was freed from jail in 1996.",

It is as if Mr Bin Laden had been consulting the most up-to-date management gurus.</p> <p>What Mr al-Fadl had to say helped explain why his former boss appears so powerful and invincible and, paradoxically, why his sudden death or disappearance would be unlikely to stem the unpredictable violence in which al-Qaeda specialises.</p> <p>The most striking feature of Mr al-Fadl's testimony was all the banal detail of the nine-to-five grind of a career in terrorism.</p> <p>In al-Qaeda's offices in Khartoum, the boss sat in the first office on the left. There were board meetings, wage nego tiations and the firm took care of its employees' healthcare. There were perks for employees, such as free tea and groceries, and an in-house specialist for the interpretation of dreams. A travel department obtained tickets and passports to order.</p> <p>As in all multinational corporations, al-Qaeda appears to suffer from constant friction and mutual envy among the various national groups working for it.</p> <p>Mr al-Fadl had joined the organisation at the beginning, in Afghanistan in 1990, when Mr Bin Laden, the maverick heir to a Saudi construction fortune, decided to divert the money and resources he had poured into the mojahedin war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and channel into a new jihad - against the \"snake\", the United States.</p> <p>Mr al-Fadl recalled Mr Bin Laden and his closest advisers issuing a fatwah against the US at the time of the Gulf war. He said: \"The fatwah, it say we cannot let the American army stay in the Gulf area and take our oil, take our money and we have to to do something to take them out. We have to fight them.\"</p> <p>When the newly formed al-Qaeda decamped to Sudan on the invitation of a radical Islamic regime in Khartoum, Mr al-Fadl became a trusted employee. He once delivered $100,000 in cash to an al-Qaeda member in Jordan (where the organisation arranged for customs officers to overlook the dollar-stuffed bag), and on another occasion he was sent off with enough money to buy 50 camels to smuggle weapons into Egypt.</p> <p>But he bristled at the fact that the Egyptians in the organisation earned far more than his $500 a month and appeared to wield more clout. He confronted his boss with his complaints, but Mr Bin Laden told him the Egyptians were paid extra to help them visit their families back home.</p> <p>\"He say ... some people, they got citizenship from another country and they go back over there for regular life,\" Mr al-Fadl told the court. \"And he says that's why he try to make them happy and give them more money.\"</p> <p>Mr al-Fadl was not appeased and decided to top up his salary himself, skimming off a total of $110,000 in the form of under-the-counter commissions for contracts awarded. He was caught, but Mr Bin Laden ordered him to repay the money in order to gain forgiveness.</p> <p>However, the world's most feared terrorist may have been too laid back for his own good. Mr al-Fadl could not repay the money and instead fled Sudan and ran into the arms of the CIA. He must have been a heaven-sent source for the agency with a detailed inside picture of Mr Bin Laden's organisation.</p> <p>By the time it reached the southern district court in Manhattan it was of course, already out of date. Mr Bin Laden has since decamped to Afghanistan, and the Sudanese operation has been rolled up. But Mr al-Fadl's testimony still says a lot about his organisational style.</p> <p>In Sudan, according to Mr al-Fadl, al-Qaeda had a board of directors, the Shura council, a panel of a dozen or so trusted lieutenants, which discussed and coordinated all the organisation's far-flung activities.</p> <p>Subordinate to the council were four executive committees: military, responsible for weapons and training; money and business, in charge of all al-Qaeda's commercial operations as well as personnel, salaries and healthcare; Islamic study, charged with maintaining the theological rigour of the organisation; and media, which ran a weekly newspaper. Its editor wrote under the ironic pen name of Abu Massad Reuter, in honour of the British news agency, Reuters.</p> <p>The organisation ran a network of money-making ventures in Sudan under an umbrella holding corporation called Wadi al-Aqiq, which Mr al-Fadl referred to as \"the mother of all companies\". Its subsidiaries included Ladin International, an import-export company; Taba investment; which traded currencies; Hijra Construction, a civil engineering company and Themar al-Mubaraka, which ran a farm growing sesame seeds, peanuts and corn.</p> <p>All these disparate enterprises were aimed at propagating al-Qaeda's core \"product\", jihad (or holy war). The commercial groups helped sustain Mr Bin Laden's fortune, which either financed al-Qaeda terrorist operations or sponsored a wide variety of like-minded groups from around the world, who came for weapons training and bomb-making instruction at the Themar al-Mubaraka farm in Sudan.</p> <p>Many of the trainees were Egyptians from the Islamic Jihad movement. Its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri has emerged as Mr Bin Laden's deputy. Other al-Qaeda clients have included Filipino Muslim separatists, Algerians (like the Montreal cell broken up last year after Ahmed Ressam tried to smuggle explosives over the US border near Seattle) and Yemenis (like the group that carried out the boat-bomb attack on the USS Cole).</p> <p><b> 'Franchise'</b><br></p> <p>There were also Arab Americans like two of the defendants in the New York trial: Wahid el-Hage, the manager of a shop in Dallas and Ali Mohamed, an Egyptian-born former US army sergeant who was assigned to instruct special forces on Islamic politics and culture. It turns out that he remained an agent for Egyptian Islamic Jihad.</p> <p>All these cells operated on their own, but they looked for money, training and direction to the centre and al-Qaeda.</p> <p>\"In corporate terms, it's not IBM but more like a franchise, like Kentucky Fried Chicken,\" Brian Jenkins, a US terrorism expert, said. \"One of the trends we have seen in terrorism organisations in the last 10 years is that they have become a lot more fluid. There are a lot more networks than the more traditional hierarchies. Al-Qaeda has done away with layers of middle management, but its still able to maintain its 'brand'.\"</p> <p>This \"branding\", Mr Jenkins suggests, represents the \"return\" Mr Bin Laden accrues on his investments in disparate acts of terrorism. Increasingly the west attributes them to him, solidifying his legendary status in the angry refugee camps and impoverished slums of the Arab world.</p> <p>The myth was burnished further last week when the CIA director, George Tenet, called Mr Bin Laden the \"most immediate threat to America's national security\".</p> <p>By pressuring Sudan to expel Mr Bin Laden, the US has managed to raise his operating costs. Patrick Clawson, the research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said: \"He is no longer in the heart of the Arab world. It is very different trying to operate out of Afghanistan where every movement in and out is going to be suspicious.\"</p> <p>The point was underlined yesterday when it was announced that two Saudi men, a father and son, had been arrested by Pakistani police on the Afghan border carrying cash to Mr Bin Laden. However, it is thought that al-Qaeda is still able to move most of its funds around with the aid of the internet and state-of-the-art encryption devices.</p> <p>Just as modern, flexible business organisations can rapidly adapt to changing markets, so can al-Qaeda. The portrait being painted in court this month is a rapidly-fading snapshot of the past.</p> <p>The organisation has shown its ability to mutate a hundred times since then. To keep up, western counter-intelligence must rely on all the satellite surveillance tools at its disposal, together with the hope that one day, another underpaid al-Qaeda clerk will show up at the visa window of another US embassy.</p>",

He must have been a heaven-sent source for the agency with a detailed inside picture of Mr Bin Laden's organisation. By the time it reached the southern district court in Manhattan it was of course, already out of date. Mr Bin Laden has since decamped to Afghanistan, and the Sudanese operation has been rolled up. But Mr al-Fadl's testimony still says a lot about his organisational style. In Sudan, according to Mr al-Fadl, al-Qaeda had a board of directors, the Shura council, a panel of a dozen or so trusted lieutenants, which discussed and coordinated all the organisation's far-flung activities. Subordinate to the council were four executive committees: military, responsible for weapons and training; money and business, in charge of all al-Qaeda's commercial operations as well as personnel, salaries and healthcare; Islamic study, charged with maintaining the theological rigour of the organisation; and media, which ran a weekly newspaper. Its editor wrote under the ironic pen name of Abu Massad Reuter, in honour of the British news agency, Reuters. The organisation ran a network of money-making ventures in Sudan under an umbrella holding corporation called Wadi al-Aqiq, which Mr al-Fadl referred to as \"the mother of all companies\". Its subsidiaries included Ladin International, an import-export company; Taba investment; which traded currencies; Hijra Construction, a civil engineering company and Themar al-Mubaraka, which ran a farm growing sesame seeds, peanuts and corn. All these disparate enterprises were aimed at propagating al-Qaeda's core \"product\", jihad (or holy war). The commercial groups helped sustain Mr Bin Laden's fortune, which either financed al-Qaeda terrorist operations or sponsored a wide variety of like-minded groups from around the world, who came for weapons training and bomb-making instruction at the Themar al-Mubaraka farm in Sudan. Many of the trainees were Egyptians from the Islamic Jihad movement. Its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri has emerged as Mr Bin Laden's deputy. Other al-Qaeda clients have included Filipino Muslim separatists, Algerians (like the Montreal cell broken up last year after Ahmed Ressam tried to smuggle explosives over the US border near Seattle) and Yemenis (like the group that carried out the boat-bomb attack on the USS Cole). 'Franchise' There were also Arab Americans like two of the defendants in the New York trial: Wahid el-Hage, the manager of a shop in Dallas and Ali Mohamed, an Egyptian-born former US army sergeant who was assigned to instruct special forces on Islamic politics and culture. It turns out that he remained an agent for Egyptian Islamic Jihad. All these cells operated on their own, but they looked for money, training and direction to the centre and al-Qaeda. \"In corporate terms, it's not IBM but more like a franchise, like Kentucky Fried Chicken,\" Brian Jenkins, a US terrorism expert, said. \"One of the trends we have seen in terrorism organisations in the last 10 years is that they have become a lot more fluid. There are a lot more networks than the more traditional hierarchies. Al-Qaeda has done away with layers of middle management, but its still able to maintain its 'brand'.\" This \"branding\", Mr Jenkins suggests, represents the \"return\" Mr Bin Laden accrues on his investments in disparate acts of terrorism. Increasingly the west attributes them to him, solidifying his legendary status in the angry refugee camps and impoverished slums of the Arab world. The myth was burnished further last week when the CIA director, George Tenet, called Mr Bin Laden the \"most immediate threat to America's national security\". By pressuring Sudan to expel Mr Bin Laden, the US has managed to raise his operating costs. Patrick Clawson, the research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said: \"He is no longer in the heart of the Arab world. It is very different trying to operate out of Afghanistan where every movement in and out is going to be suspicious.\" The point was underlined yesterday when it was announced that two Saudi men, a father and son, had been arrested by Pakistani police on the Afghan border carrying cash to Mr Bin Laden. However, it is thought that al-Qaeda is still able to move most of its funds around with the aid of the internet and state-of-the-art encryption devices. Just as modern, flexible business organisations can rapidly adapt to changing markets, so can al-Qaeda. The portrait being painted in court this month is a rapidly-fading snapshot of the past. The organisation has shown its ability to mutate a hundred times since then. To keep up, western counter-intelligence must rely on all the satellite surveillance tools at its disposal, together with the hope that one day, another underpaid al-Qaeda clerk will show up at the visa window of another US embassy.",

There has already been a trade paperback, but this new edition has an updated introduction (of which more in a minute). This book is important because depression now seems to be prevalent enough to affect the lives of those without it. It is also a good idea not only to discover what those who suffer from depression are going through, but to use the book to perform a bit of self-diagnosis, and to distinguish clinical depression from a case of the blues or indulgent self-pity. (On a personal note: it would appear that my extreme disinclination to do absolutely anything whatsoever is actually sloth, and not depression.) </p> <p>One quick test, supported if not overtly recommended by Malignant Sadness , is to see whether the final lines of Robert Burton's \"Abstract of Melancholy\" apply to oneself: \"Ile change my state with any wretch, / Thou canst from geale [jail] or dunghill fetch: / My paines past cure, another Hell, / I may not in this torment dwell, / Now desperate I hate my life, / Lend me an halter or a knife. / All my griefs to this are jolly, / Naught so damn'd as Melancholy.\" </p> <p>Professor Wolpert is well qualified to write about the subject: not only is he an excellent writer, but he has suffered from depression himself. He is also intelligent enough, and scientifically minded enough, to be able to step aside from the stigma that attaches itself to many sufferers. There should be no shame, however much the mental state the condition drives one into may encourage feelings of guilt.

(Knowing that Poe suffered from it is no help at all.) Wolpert's new introduction describes a bout that occurred after the first publication of Malignant Sadness : \"When a friend urged me to read my own book I was not even amused.\" Sad, that, but understandable. The trick, it would appear, is to keep doing things. Wolpert quotes Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (Wolpert's title is a very deliberate salute to that great work): \"I write of Melancholy, by being busy to avoid Melancholy.\" His work even closes with Burton's advice: \"Be not idle.\" </p> <p>That is all well and good, and more useful than a well-meaning exhortation to cheer up, but there is much more to this book. Although there is something mildly alarming about saying so, it is worth reading in its own right. Wolpert quotes Stanley Jackson, who has written a history of the subject: \"With such distress, we are at the very heart of being human.\" Chapters address the question of who gets depressed and why, the experience of depression in other cultures, the incidence and risk of suicide, the comparative virtues of psychotherapy and drugs; all in lucid, no-nonsense prose. </p> <p>No-nonsense is a key quality here, one suspects. Having a no-nonsense partner might help, too. Wolpert, ceaselessly contemplating suicide, writes that his wife \"became very angry and said my suicide would have an intolerable effect on her and my children.

Brains splattered below the dado and blood-stained underskirts set the tone of this portrayal of one woman's derangement. Given Blundy's biography (the workhouse, prison, rape and the loss of a child when still a child herself), the love of sympathetic Ewan is no panacea. The brutality of Myerson's writing is extraordinarily unsettling. Certain episodes will stick, no matter how hard you try to dislodge them. This is historical fiction with the comfort blanket of nostalgia pulled off. </p> <p> <strong> Soul Mountain</strong><br>Gao Xingjian <br>(Flamingo, \u00a39.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000528035,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> The winner of last year's Nobel prize, Gao has spent the last decade as an exile in Paris. His plays were performed in Beijing in the early 1980s but fell victim to a campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". A mistaken diagnosis of lung cancer gave him a few weeks' respite before the authorities were to sentence him to \"re-education\". Gao's flight to rural China to evade imprisonment inspired this dazzling autobiographical novel peopled with an imagined lover and characters from Chinese folklore. Superficially, this epic picaresque resembles familiar western literary forms but its bedrock is utterly other. It is a hard read, but the journey is worth the effort. </p> <p> <strong> The Romantics</strong> <br>Pankaj Mishra<br> (Picador, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000350405,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Samar, the impressionable narrator of this debut, moves from political anarchy at university in Allahabad to the cosmopolitan world of a Benares boarding house, where, under the wing of Miss West, he meets other westerners all hoping to capture the essence of India. This is a novel about growing up, discernment, love and the getting of wisdom - all the ideas, in fact, that attract first-time novelists. But it is not simply the unexpected setting and viewpoint that set The Romantics apart, it is Mishra's exceptionally finely worked style and subtle observation. Turgenev is as much a point of reference for Mishra as for his hero: both warrant the comparison. </p> <p> <strong> Love, Always </strong><br>Sally Brampton <br>(Arrow, \u00a35.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502130530,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Brampton's novel is unfortunately packaged. The pink-and-purple cover, with its artfully photographed naked figure and embossed title, suggests an undemanding, faintly literary, romantic story. Brampton writes about love, but it is the selfish and obsessive sort. As the child of expats, Jane Rose knows that while some emotional ties are easily broken, others grip forever. Her love for her daughter, for Ben, once again her lover after an eight-year gap, and her dislike for his manipulative wife, Rebecca, seem immutable until Ben informs her that Rebecca's latest suicide attempt has succeeded. Brampton writes compellingly about messy, mature emotions. </p> <p> <strong> Build My Gallows High</strong> <br>Geoffrey Homes<br> (Prion, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000347282,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> The author (real name Daniel Mainwaring) turned out pulp fiction either side of the war: just picture the covers for The Man Who Murdered Himself , Stiffs Don't Vote , The Doctor Died at Dusk or Invasion of the Body Snatchers . Homes then hit paydirt with his darkest piece of noir. In less than a year his story of how Red Bailey, the world's weariest ex-private eye, gets marched out of his retirement gas station, away from the girl next door and back east into the arms of the mob and a flinty femme fatale, was filmed, starring the sleepy-lidded Robert Mitchum as star. A classic that lifts off the page even without Mitchum mouthing his dialogue into your ear.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Laura Blundy Julie Myerson (Fourth Estate, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL If you are watching the repeats of The 1900 House , then you will easily picture the back parlour into which Myerson pushes the reader to watch as Laura bludgeons her husband to death. Brains splattered below the dado and blood-stained underskirts set the tone of this portrayal of one woman's derangement. Given Blundy's biography (the workhouse, prison, rape and the loss of a child when still a child herself), the love of sympathetic Ewan is no panacea. The brutality of Myerson's writing is extraordinarily unsettling. Certain episodes will stick, no matter how hard you try to dislodge them. This is historical fiction with the comfort blanket of nostalgia pulled off. Soul Mountain Gao Xingjian (Flamingo, \u00a39.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL The winner of last year's Nobel prize, Gao has spent the last decade as an exile in Paris. His plays were performed in Beijing in the early 1980s but fell victim to a campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". A mistaken diagnosis of lung cancer gave him a few weeks' respite before the authorities were to sentence him to \"re-education\". Gao's flight to rural China to evade imprisonment inspired this dazzling autobiographical novel peopled with an imagined lover and characters from Chinese folklore. Superficially, this epic picaresque resembles familiar western literary forms but its bedrock is utterly other. It is a hard read, but the journey is worth the effort. The Romantics Pankaj Mishra (Picador, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL Samar, the impressionable narrator of this debut, moves from political anarchy at university in Allahabad to the cosmopolitan world of a Benares boarding house, where, under the wing of Miss West, he meets other westerners all hoping to capture the essence of India. This is a novel about growing up, discernment, love and the getting of wisdom - all the ideas, in fact, that attract first-time novelists. But it is not simply the unexpected setting and viewpoint that set The Romantics apart, it is Mishra's exceptionally finely worked style and subtle observation. Turgenev is as much a point of reference for Mishra as for his hero: both warrant the comparison. Love, Always Sally Brampton (Arrow, \u00a35.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL Brampton's novel is unfortunately packaged. The pink-and-purple cover, with its artfully photographed naked figure and embossed title, suggests an undemanding, faintly literary, romantic story. Brampton writes about love, but it is the selfish and obsessive sort. As the child of expats, Jane Rose knows that while some emotional ties are easily broken, others grip forever. Her love for her daughter, for Ben, once again her lover after an eight-year gap, and her dislike for his manipulative wife, Rebecca, seem immutable until Ben informs her that Rebecca's latest suicide attempt has succeeded. Brampton writes compellingly about messy, mature emotions. Build My Gallows High Geoffrey Homes (Prion, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL The author (real name Daniel Mainwaring) turned out pulp fiction either side of the war: just picture the covers for The Man Who Murdered Himself , Stiffs Don't Vote , The Doctor Died at Dusk or Invasion of the Body Snatchers . Homes then hit paydirt with his darkest piece of noir. In less than a year his story of how Red Bailey, the world's weariest ex-private eye, gets marched out of his retirement gas station, away from the girl next door and back east into the arms of the mob and a flinty femme fatale, was filmed, starring the sleepy-lidded Robert Mitchum as star. A classic that lifts off the page even without Mitchum mouthing his dialogue into your ear.",

Maps offer a reduction of all this to abstract, geometrical symbols. Their coding of the world is practical, but they also allow us to travel in imagination without having to settle one way or the other our ambivalence over strangeness; over whether we really want to encounter the fact of it, or just enjoy the idea of it. Philip Larkin was speaking for this undecided bit in all of us when he said that he wouldn't mind seeing China, so long as he could come back the same afternoon. </p> <p>So when people passionately collect maps, it's often a sign of a specially intense or even troubled relationship with the knowledge that maps lay out for us as lines and boundaries and contours. Not surprisingly, when Miles Harvey heard of someone who compulsively stole maps, he was excited. It's such a suggestively transgressive thing to do: crossing society's borderline in order to get your mitts on the borderlines and shaded continents of the printed variety. </p> <p>At first Harvey, working as a journalist for the adventure travel magazine Outside , envisaged writing a fairly conventional feature. A man called Gilbert Bland had been caught in the Peabody Library in Baltimore in December 1995 after slicing two charts out of antiquarian books with a razorblade. The notebook that Peabody's security guards found on him revealed that he had previously done the same thing at a long, long list of scholarly libraries around America - that he was, in fact, the greatest map thief in American history. </p> <p>Harvey planned to interview Gilbert Bland, find out his side of the story and discover how he had been able to sell on his trophies into the antiquarian book trade for years and years without anyone suspecting. But Bland declined his 15 minutes of fame. He refused to be interviewed; and the more Harvey tried to pin down the characteristics of his antihero, the more elusive and indeterminate this unscrupulous forty-something Vietnam veteran seemed to become. </p> <p>In a curious way, the camouflage of completely forgettable clothes that Bland wore in libraries did seem to express something essential about him. He suited his surname; he had the gift of vanishing. Consequently Harvey has produced something potentially much more interesting and ambitious than he first intended: a book structured by Bland's resolute absence. The Island of Lost Maps pursues him, not directly but by following the themes raised by the case, into the history of cartography. The book ventures into the world of map auctions and map lust, into the Renaissance technology of map-printing, down a deliberate proliferation of byways. </p> <p>Elegant little hooks and eyes of metaphor join the text together.

      "bodyText": "The Island of Lost Maps: A True Story of Cartographic Crime Miles Harvey 416pp, Weidenfeld, \u00a312.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Very big, the world - absolutely stuffed with strangers talking languages you don't understand, eating foods you don't recognise and engaging in activities you find unsympathetic. Maps offer a reduction of all this to abstract, geometrical symbols. Their coding of the world is practical, but they also allow us to travel in imagination without having to settle one way or the other our ambivalence over strangeness; over whether we really want to encounter the fact of it, or just enjoy the idea of it. Philip Larkin was speaking for this undecided bit in all of us when he said that he wouldn't mind seeing China, so long as he could come back the same afternoon. So when people passionately collect maps, it's often a sign of a specially intense or even troubled relationship with the knowledge that maps lay out for us as lines and boundaries and contours. Not surprisingly, when Miles Harvey heard of someone who compulsively stole maps, he was excited. It's such a suggestively transgressive thing to do: crossing society's borderline in order to get your mitts on the borderlines and shaded continents of the printed variety. At first Harvey, working as a journalist for the adventure travel magazine Outside , envisaged writing a fairly conventional feature. A man called Gilbert Bland had been caught in the Peabody Library in Baltimore in December 1995 after slicing two charts out of antiquarian books with a razorblade. The notebook that Peabody's security guards found on him revealed that he had previously done the same thing at a long, long list of scholarly libraries around America - that he was, in fact, the greatest map thief in American history. Harvey planned to interview Gilbert Bland, find out his side of the story and discover how he had been able to sell on his trophies into the antiquarian book trade for years and years without anyone suspecting. But Bland declined his 15 minutes of fame. He refused to be interviewed; and the more Harvey tried to pin down the characteristics of his antihero, the more elusive and indeterminate this unscrupulous forty-something Vietnam veteran seemed to become. In a curious way, the camouflage of completely forgettable clothes that Bland wore in libraries did seem to express something essential about him. He suited his surname; he had the gift of vanishing. Consequently Harvey has produced something potentially much more interesting and ambitious than he first intended: a book structured by Bland's resolute absence. The Island of Lost Maps pursues him, not directly but by following the themes raised by the case, into the history of cartography. The book ventures into the world of map auctions and map lust, into the Renaissance technology of map-printing, down a deliberate proliferation of byways. Elegant little hooks and eyes of metaphor join the text together. Harvey moves from map margins to social margins, from a remark by a map dealer in Florida to the serpent's words to Adam and Eve in Eden. The agenda is set not by discoveries about Bland the finite criminal from Miami, but by the associative steps Harvey takes. If you are drawn to the kind of \"desperate excursions\" Bland took, argues Harvey, \"You have to believe . . . that there are places in the world where you can get lost, places where you can leave your old life behind, places where normal rules don't apply.\" Disarmingly, Harvey is very upfront about his own extrovert, un-Blandlike psyche. This sets things up nicely for the book's payoff - which is not a conclusion about Bland, but Harvey's own startled realisation that in the effort to understand his subject he has come perilously close to stalking him. The only photograph of Gilbert Bland in the book shows him covering his face entirely with his hands. Such is the ingenuity of all this, so graceful is Harvey in turning the opacities of his subject into his subject, that it seems churlish to object to the thinness of the material - beside the point to remark that the book amounts to an artful concoction of not much.

There goes one now, hopping over the fence into the little park at the end of the Ile St Louis in Paris. It's night, so he has to be careful as he pushes his way through the bushes and climbs over the rusting rings for mooring boats on the quayside. </p> <p>But that's only the start of the adventure. Once on the quay, the main thing to be careful of is those searchlights sweeping along the island from the bateaux-mouches, making all the couples part abruptly and pull up their trousers. That's the fl\u00e2neur , caught in the spotlight, blushing perhaps but with a wry smile playing around his lips. </p> <p>This, at least, is Edmund White's kind of fl\u00e2neur , cruising for sex while a few yards away tourists are paying through the nose for grim dinner-dancing experiences as they float along the Seine. When White lived in Paris between 1983 and 1998, he quickly found the best places to cruise. The Palais Royal and the Tuileries gardens (especially the gravel walkways by the Orangerie) sound like delightful places for outdoor sex, though why he thought the quay near Gare d'Austerlitz would be is, frankly, beyond me. </p> <p>He writes: \"Most people, straight or gay, think that cruising is pathetic or sordid - but for me, at least, some of my happiest moments have been spent making love to a stranger beside dark, swiftly moving water below a glowing city.\" Paris: city of light, but better, city of darkness and anonymous sex. White maintains, not very convincingly and rather half-heartedly, that cruising is an extension or application of the art of the fl\u00e2neur . </p> <p>Those practitioners and theoreticians of the art, Walter Benjamin and Charles Baudelaire, wouldn't have had much time for that idea, and nor should we. The whole point about a fl\u00e2neur is that he or she is an aimless stroller. By contrast, a cruiser is utterly directed, as Schopenhauer might have put it, towards the extinction of his desire. The fl\u00e2neur 's desire is much less ardent, perhaps approaching non-existence, and thus resembles the disinterested appreciation that Kant argued was characteristic of aesthetic experience. </p> <p>So what is a flneur if not a middle-aged gay American writer looking for an alfresco sexual thrill? Benjamin put it this way: \"The great reminiscences, the historical frissons - these are all so much junk to the fl\u00e2neur , who is happy to leave them to the tourist. And he would be happy to trade all his knowledge of artists' quarters, birthplaces, and princely palaces for the scent of a single weathered tile - that which any old dog carries away.\" </p> <p>For Benjamin, Rome could never be a fl\u00e2neur 's city - the weight of national shrines, temples and official culture was too oppressive for the flneur 's dreams to flourish there. As a result, for him and for Edmund White, Paris became the capital city of fl\u00e2nerie . But why? One of the reasons is boringly practical. Paris, at least that part of it within the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique , is a walker's city. You can cross it (if you put your mind to it) in an afternoon. You can't do that in New York, nor in London. </p> <p>Not that London doesn't have its flneurs : Karl Marx, in a sense, was one, Iain Sinclair another, and the two films made by Patrick Keiller, London and Robinson in Space , are devoted to a very abject wandering that is all the London fl\u00e2neur can manage. But that seems only an ironic flnerie , as necessarily ironic as a British road movie. </p> <p>The fl\u00e2neur 's city needs to be big, so he or she can get lost in the crowd. This great paradoxical dream of modernity, finding oneself in anonymity, is best expressed by Baudelaire, that dandy of fl\u00e2neurs , who used to wander Paris gloved in pink and stepping as if walking between eggs. </p> <p>\"The crowd is his domain, as the air is that of the bird or the sea of the fish. His passion and his creed is to wed the crowd. For the perfect fl\u00e2neur , for the passionate observer, it's an immense pleasure to take up residence in multiplicity, in whatever is seething, moving, evanescent and infinite.\" </p> <p>Sadly for us, Baudelaire's Paris was bulldozed after 1853 by Baron Haussmann. Still, perhaps we shouldn't worry unduly: the fl\u00e2neur can wander through these boulevards with the infinite crowds and, thanks to Haussmannian generosity with street furniture, have a free sit-down now and again too. </p> <p>This is a small, chatty volume of the kind that White has turned out in recent years with great success. His queer biography of Proust was a little jewel, while his slim book Sketches from Memory: People and Places in the Heart of Our Parisness was a lovely precursor to the present volume. He has some neat observations on Paris here. Thus: \"La D\u00e9fense went directly from being futuristic to being pass\u00e9 without ever seeming like a normal feature of the present.\" </p> <p>But what makes this book especially appealing is that it teems with private discoveries made public, rather than because he has successfully applied Walter Benjamin's thought that for the fl\u00e2neur history is dross, or Baudelaire's notion of the passionate pleasures of anonymity (White hardly ever seems to be in a crowd). </p> <p>Wherever he goes, White is overtaken by historical frissons. Thus, he visits Chapelle Expiatoire (corner Boul Haussmann and Rue Pasquier, open Thurs, Fri, Sat afternoons). This melancholy memorial opened in 1826 on the spot where Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were interred by revolutionaries until their remains were removed to the Cathedral of St Denis. Reflecting on this sucks him, delightfully, into a discussion of royalist revivalism in France, and into a bar-tabac on the Rue de Rivoli where the patron rails against those upstart Orl\u00e9ans and defends the Bourbon claim to head a newly monarchical France. Jacques Chirac, one suspects, isn't an habitu\u00e9 . </p> <p>We find White in now-boring St Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, wondering where all that creativity - le jazz hot and l'existentialism froid - went. We discover him at the venue of the Hachichins Club where Balzac, Gautier, Manet, Baudelaire and other impressive people would meet to eat hash in jelly form and hallucinate wildly. </p> <p>Sometimes White seems to be describing a coherent Parisian walk of the kind a tourist might follow, then he gets sidetracked as a true flneur must. Only Geoff Dyer, in the Time Out Book of Paris Walks , has attempted something similar: a deconstruction of a tourist walk that starts off in a quest for a bar that no longer exists, and thus never really ends. But even when White abandons Benjamin's stricture and rambles off into great reminiscences and historical frissons, he is compelling. There are fine discussions about how the French have dealt with Aids (hang your head, Michel Foucault, among others), how Parisians have been paradoxically welcoming to other races and disturbingly racist, and a fond appreciation of Colette (the French, annoyingly, have had little time for her). </p> <p>There are so many books written by anglophones about Paris, most of them by news reporters who have completed their Parisian stints and feel obliged to write dreary state-of-the-nation volumes, that it is good to read a refreshingly unjournalistic take on the paradoxes of Paris. White finds France in the details he unearths: thus he loves to relate the story of how Jean Genet (whose biography he wrote recently) was defended by Jean Cocteau. Genet was on trial for theft and obviously guilty, but Cocteau wrote to the judge advising him how awful it would be for his French reputation if he convicted such a great writer. The judge, showing himself to be a true Frenchman, did not convict Genet. </p> <p>One problem with the book: it has maps of Paris on the endpapers showing how to get to the places White writes about. But by definition, surely, the fl\u00e2neur can have no use for them, and must prefer to find his own Paris. Look at the maps more closely, though, and you'll see they are so hopeless that you'll never be able to find anything by using them. Nice touch.</p>",

Intellectual contemplation and the raw physicality of the athlete happily coexist in Renaissance man. Brain does not exclude brawn; displays of explosive strength can be followed by periods of cerebral calm. </p> <p>But rarely have sport and literature combined so seamlessly to produce such an absorbing and satisfying novel as this small miracle of a book from Holland by H M van den Brink. Sweetly lyrical, it tells of a shy young boy's coming of age through sport in Amsterdam as Europe prepares for war. </p> <p>Innocent Anton's awakening happens during a year spent learning to row on the river in a \"pair\" with the enigmatic but attractively confident David. Their German coach, Dr Schneiderhahn, newly arrived with a wealth of \"foreign\" coaching techniques, is even more mysterious, disappearing occasionally on unexplained business trips. However, he devotes great commitment to the crew's development as a partnership, from novices to national championship contenders. The experience changes the direction of Anton's life. </p> <p>But it is the poetic strength and simplicity of the writing that seduces the reader. It underscores the almost mystical relationship rowers have with the river, the weather, fatigue, each other, their own exertions and the constant drama of the mental battles they face in training and competition. </p> <p>The story is punctuated by passages detailing Anton's wandering through the stricken city just before the end of the second world war, seeking out the places on the river that had given him such perfect happiness five years earlier. But the core of On the Water is told in flashbacks, and focuses on those carefree months between 1938 and 1939. </p> <p>\"Don't you read the papers?\" asks David, pointing up Anton's complete obliviousness to everything outside their small, intense world of training. So we never discover how the invaders arrived, how war disrupted the rowers' lives or what became of them during that terrible time. There is a teasing quality in this snapshot of a moment in life. Did the protagonists ever meet again? \"That,\" says van den Brink, \"is the reader's domain.\" The horror that the occupation held for Anton is never referred to, but the idyll is at an end, replaced by melancholic memories. </p> <p>Much is left unsaid, and the three men have a surreal lack of curiosity about each others' lives that resonates well with the reality of an athlete's life in full training.

      "bodyText": "On the Water H M van den Brink, trans Paul Vincent 134pp, Faber, \u00a39.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Books ostensibly about sport tend to appeal to a specialist audience, yet there is also a tradition in literature of the sportsman/warrior-poet. Intellectual contemplation and the raw physicality of the athlete happily coexist in Renaissance man. Brain does not exclude brawn; displays of explosive strength can be followed by periods of cerebral calm. But rarely have sport and literature combined so seamlessly to produce such an absorbing and satisfying novel as this small miracle of a book from Holland by H M van den Brink. Sweetly lyrical, it tells of a shy young boy's coming of age through sport in Amsterdam as Europe prepares for war. Innocent Anton's awakening happens during a year spent learning to row on the river in a \"pair\" with the enigmatic but attractively confident David. Their German coach, Dr Schneiderhahn, newly arrived with a wealth of \"foreign\" coaching techniques, is even more mysterious, disappearing occasionally on unexplained business trips. However, he devotes great commitment to the crew's development as a partnership, from novices to national championship contenders. The experience changes the direction of Anton's life. But it is the poetic strength and simplicity of the writing that seduces the reader. It underscores the almost mystical relationship rowers have with the river, the weather, fatigue, each other, their own exertions and the constant drama of the mental battles they face in training and competition. The story is punctuated by passages detailing Anton's wandering through the stricken city just before the end of the second world war, seeking out the places on the river that had given him such perfect happiness five years earlier. But the core of On the Water is told in flashbacks, and focuses on those carefree months between 1938 and 1939. \"Don't you read the papers?\" asks David, pointing up Anton's complete obliviousness to everything outside their small, intense world of training. So we never discover how the invaders arrived, how war disrupted the rowers' lives or what became of them during that terrible time. There is a teasing quality in this snapshot of a moment in life. Did the protagonists ever meet again? \"That,\" says van den Brink, \"is the reader's domain.\" The horror that the occupation held for Anton is never referred to, but the idyll is at an end, replaced by melancholic memories. Much is left unsaid, and the three men have a surreal lack of curiosity about each others' lives that resonates well with the reality of an athlete's life in full training. All that matters is the time spent on the water in the boat, sharing the supreme efforts needed to produce perfect harmony. After training, there's a drink or a sandwich together, and then they are off to their separate existences until reconvening for the next high-octane session.

There has long been an opposition between lyricism and opacity in DeLillo's work.

Luckily for American writer Nomi Eve, her father wrote her family history down. In <strong> The Family Orchard</strong> (Little, Brown, \u00a312.99), a spirited crusade through five generations of an extended Jewish family, his text runs in the margins alongside a much-embellished account of her own.

In the quantum theory, space is a pre-existing arena in which things can happen; quantum theory merely gives the rules for those happenings. But in Einstein's theory, space is something else altogether. It arises out of the relationships between objects - planets, galaxies and so on. Think of a sentence, says Smolin; it is not simply a container into which one puts words. Without any words, there would be no sentence; similarly, in Einstein's theory, space has no existence apart from the objects that move within it. </p> <p>So the very notion of space has a different meaning in the two fundamental theories, and Smolin's book traces physicists' attempts to overcome this central sticking point. For decades, one popular strategy has been to force Ein stein's theory to pay homage to the dictates of quantum theory.

More recently, however, physicists have recognised that if geometry is the essence of Einstein's theory, it should remain so - whatever demands quantum theory may make. </p> <p>Smolin presents the newest and most exciting ideas of physicists working in this direction. These invariably involve some of the most sophisticated mathematical gymnastics in all of science. Fortunately, Smolin has a talent for explaining the core ideas behind the bewildering details. </p> <p>As he sees it, there are three principal strands of thinking on the problem - his \"three roads\". One issues from a branch of physics known as string theory, which views all particles as tiny vibrating strings and which has been in the news for more than a decade as a potential \"theory of everything\".

      "body": "<p>I enjoyed my weekend in Shropshire with Fred - a decorous middle-aged fling. You would not call it Wrekin havoc. Shropshire is so laid-back - everybody round there is born out of Wenlock. And I returned refreshed. The dalliance worked because we were both thinking of Joseph Fiennes. And I was encouraged by the story of geriatric erotics in Love In The Time Of Cholera, by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Although speaking as a hypochondriac, there wasn't nearly enough in it about cholera, and far too much about love.</p> <p>\"I'm so glad you'rrre home,\" sighs Aunt. She thinks that now I've had a weekend in the Blue Remembered Hills, I need never leave home again. But just remembering the Blue Remembered Hills is not going to be enough. Fred and I have formed a treacherous plan to go away on a proper holiday to somewhere hot with a lot of vowels and a turquoise sea.</p> <p>\"Never leave me alone with this lot again!\" hisses Harriet. \"Elaine was throwing herself at Dad all the time and Aunt Elspeth was pissing into the sofa!\" My second, longer holiday is going to have to be very carefully spin-doctored. Aunt fears she cannot survive without me, and Harriet and her father are seething in stereo.</p> <p>\"Fred and I are going away on a proper holiday soon,\" I blurt out. The whole family glares at me as if I have emitted not 11 harmless words but a sulphurous cloud of dioxin.</p> <p>Except Elaine. \"Oh, what a good idea! Don't worry, I'll look after everything here,\" she trills, radiant with martyrdom. I've done martyrdom, and it sucks.</p> <p>Fred rings to say he's got a great last-minute deal to Tobago, where Crusoe cruised and eventually met his Man Friday. \"So,\" he enquires, \"are you up for it?\" I hesitate. Liberal guilt and Calvinist work ethic have me in a half-nelson. But even Nelson himself went to the Caribbean. In fact, I think he stumbled upon his Fanny there. But first, am I fit for the tropics? Must urgently pluck the Lost Eyebrows of Heligan. And I am too fat for all my summer clothes. Venture apologetically into chic boutique and fumble through the cruise and safari wear.</p> <p>\"Are you sure you're a Medium?\" enquires bitch salesperson archly. Under the fluorescent lights of the changing room, I discover she's right. I am no longer a Medium. I am a scale model of the South Downs in uncooked pastry.</p> <p>Try on tropical shift, but resemble Maori prop forward in national costume. Escape furtively, and bitch salesperson watches me go with the kind of regret one would bestow upon a departing nightsoil cart. The Oxfam shop is more friendly. Here are a whole cluster of slightly worn linen jackets, as if a doomed gang of tropical missionaries had come home to die of some genteel Cotswold epidemic. \"After 40 years in Indo-China, he died of Water-on-the-Bourton.\" Very Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.</p> <p>Fred is to pick me up well before dawn as our flight leaves from Gatwick mid-morning. Am packed and ready, sleepless and unsettled, and when I hear the flatulent arrival of his sports car outside, I run to the front door only to discover I am locked in and the key is nowhere to be seen. \"Wait!\" I whisper through the keyhole. \"I think I know where she might have put it.\"</p> <p>Aunt Elspeth, acting as Calvin's agent (John Calvin, not Calvin Klein), often double locks doors in the dead of night and puts the keys in the freezer. But I will not be incarcerated by Fox's Book of Martyrs and other glacial torments. Yes! There is the key, next to frozen Bounty Bar - a potent symbol. Away with Protestant guilt! Besides, it will be good for my work. Saturated in M\u00e1rquez and Pina Colada, I shall essay a little Anglo-Saxon magical realism. I shall conjure up the horrid green-haired ghosts of Glastonbury and they will vomit fog and hailstones upon the ruined cricket pavilions. Why should the Latinos have all the glamour? Not so much Love In The Time Of Cholera, more Not Tonight, Dear, I'm Under The Doctor.</p> <p>Key sticks to my fingers, burning with arctic disapproval. I manage to open the door, moonlight floods the hall, and I fall into the arms of my middle-aged elopee. To boogie on Tobago. Lead me up the isle, Fred.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I enjoyed my weekend in Shropshire with Fred - a decorous middle-aged fling. You would not call it Wrekin havoc. Shropshire is so laid-back - everybody round there is born out of Wenlock. And I returned refreshed. The dalliance worked because we were both thinking of Joseph Fiennes. And I was encouraged by the story of geriatric erotics in Love In The Time Of Cholera, by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Although speaking as a hypochondriac, there wasn't nearly enough in it about cholera, and far too much about love. \"I'm so glad you'rrre home,\" sighs Aunt. She thinks that now I've had a weekend in the Blue Remembered Hills, I need never leave home again. But just remembering the Blue Remembered Hills is not going to be enough. Fred and I have formed a treacherous plan to go away on a proper holiday to somewhere hot with a lot of vowels and a turquoise sea. \"Never leave me alone with this lot again!\" hisses Harriet. \"Elaine was throwing herself at Dad all the time and Aunt Elspeth was pissing into the sofa!\" My second, longer holiday is going to have to be very carefully spin-doctored. Aunt fears she cannot survive without me, and Harriet and her father are seething in stereo. \"Fred and I are going away on a proper holiday soon,\" I blurt out. The whole family glares at me as if I have emitted not 11 harmless words but a sulphurous cloud of dioxin. Except Elaine. \"Oh, what a good idea! Don't worry, I'll look after everything here,\" she trills, radiant with martyrdom. I've done martyrdom, and it sucks. Fred rings to say he's got a great last-minute deal to Tobago, where Crusoe cruised and eventually met his Man Friday. \"So,\" he enquires, \"are you up for it?\" I hesitate. Liberal guilt and Calvinist work ethic have me in a half-nelson. But even Nelson himself went to the Caribbean. In fact, I think he stumbled upon his Fanny there. But first, am I fit for the tropics? Must urgently pluck the Lost Eyebrows of Heligan. And I am too fat for all my summer clothes. Venture apologetically into chic boutique and fumble through the cruise and safari wear. \"Are you sure you're a Medium?\" enquires bitch salesperson archly. Under the fluorescent lights of the changing room, I discover she's right. I am no longer a Medium. I am a scale model of the South Downs in uncooked pastry. Try on tropical shift, but resemble Maori prop forward in national costume. Escape furtively, and bitch salesperson watches me go with the kind of regret one would bestow upon a departing nightsoil cart. The Oxfam shop is more friendly. Here are a whole cluster of slightly worn linen jackets, as if a doomed gang of tropical missionaries had come home to die of some genteel Cotswold epidemic. \"After 40 years in Indo-China, he died of Water-on-the-Bourton.\" Very Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Fred is to pick me up well before dawn as our flight leaves from Gatwick mid-morning. Am packed and ready, sleepless and unsettled, and when I hear the flatulent arrival of his sports car outside, I run to the front door only to discover I am locked in and the key is nowhere to be seen. \"Wait!\" I whisper through the keyhole. \"I think I know where she might have put it.\" Aunt Elspeth, acting as Calvin's agent (John Calvin, not Calvin Klein), often double locks doors in the dead of night and puts the keys in the freezer. But I will not be incarcerated by Fox's Book of Martyrs and other glacial torments. Yes! There is the key, next to frozen Bounty Bar - a potent symbol. Away with Protestant guilt! Besides, it will be good for my work. Saturated in M\u00e1rquez and Pina Colada, I shall essay a little Anglo-Saxon magical realism. I shall conjure up the horrid green-haired ghosts of Glastonbury and they will vomit fog and hailstones upon the ruined cricket pavilions. Why should the Latinos have all the glamour? Not so much Love In The Time Of Cholera, more Not Tonight, Dear, I'm Under The Doctor. Key sticks to my fingers, burning with arctic disapproval. I manage to open the door, moonlight floods the hall, and I fall into the arms of my middle-aged elopee. To boogie on Tobago. Lead me up the isle, Fred.",

Andrew Wyer, 33, had been placed on the sex offenders register after indecently assaulting a two-month-old baby and a three-year-old boy. Wyer, of Southsea, Hampshire, is banned from communicating with children under 14 and prohibited from going near any school or children's home. He breached a sex offender order in April 1999 by telling authorities he was tempted to abuse again and in January last year was sent to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital for assessment. Experts there say Wyer is untreatable. However, Judge David Selwood, who was due to sentence Wyer at Portsmouth crown court on Wednesday for breaching the order, said that he may have to release him on March 30 because he does not fall within the guide lines of the Mental Health Act. The government is proposing to close the loophole in mental health legislation to make it possible to treat people with severe mental health disorder \"either in their own best interests or to protect the wider public\". But the proposals are unlikely to become law in this parliament. Judge Selwood said: \"This case shows up very clearly how difficult it is for courts to find any kind of solution to deal with defendants like this.\" He added: \"As far as I can see, nothing is in place to protect the public and nothing is in place to assist the defendant.\" Inspector Colin Michie, of Hampshire police, said: \"If Mr Wyer is released on March 30, we will be monitoring the situation.

So it was with obvious relish that Mr Fox welcomed George Bush to his ranch in the central state of Guanajuato yesterday. The seven-hour visit began with a courtesy call on Mr Fox's ailing mother behind the 17th century walls which are all that remain of the original hacienda, bought by the family at the beginning of the century. The hosts were looking primarily for signs that Mr Bush will have a more liberal migration policy and a less condescending attitude towards Mexico's famously unsuccessful efforts to fight organised crime. The meeting, dubbed the \"cowboy-boot summit\" by the Mexican press, was not expected to produce concrete commitments, but Mexicans have nevertheless been bombarded with promises that it heralds a new era of closer cooperation. So the stage chosen to offset these promises was designed to seem relaxed and friendly. Ignoring the omnipresent security and media mob, you saw the Fox family ranch and the quaint village attached to it, whose residents earnestly praised the generosity of the people in the big house. The meeting was also aimed at promoting the idea that the two leaders have personal reasons for cooperating more closely. Much was made of their shared liking for rural relaxation and unpolished rustic styles, not to mention the anecdotes about how they clicked on their first meeting in 1996, when Mr Bush was governor of Texas and Mr Fox governor of Guanajuato. The Fox camp also insists that the defeat of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71 years of unbroken rule in last year's elections has earned Mexico a \"democratic bonus\" which lets it stand unashamed before its northern neighbour. To drive all these points home, the road from the airport was plastered with posters of Mexican and US flags intertwined under the words \"prospering together\". In a village where, despite the prosperity of the Fox farm, almost everyone has relatives in the US, that means more liberal migration policies. \"Everybody here is saying that this meeting could lead to the United States opening up the border a bit, making it easy to get papers so we can go north without fear,\" said Gerardo Martinez. \"Vicente has done a lot for us, let's see what the other president can do now,\" said Salvador Rodriguez.",

I don't object to ordinary people who keep their gardens \"tidy\", in the same way that they do their houses, or indeed professional gardeners, who for a start tend to be far more attractive than the average human specimen, what with all that bending and lugging in all weathers and their avoidance of computer-screen hunchback.

      "body": "<p>You might imagine that, as a former press columnist in a national newspaper, I was miffed at not receiving one of the 600 invitations sent out by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) to its 10th anniversary jamboree last week. But you would be wrong. This \"party of the year\" was an acutely embarrassing event, and I regard it as a privilege not to have been included. I wouldn't have recognised a single actor there from a television soap opera, and I would have found it no fun to gawp at the Prince of Wales and his son William as they pirouetted nervously through the throng at a safe photographic distance from the royal mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, so would not have enjoyed it, anyway. </p> <p>I might, perhaps, have enjoyed meeting Guy Black, the PCC's director, who has always been very polite and helpful to me. But even this pleasure might have been dampened by the suspicion that he was involved in a conspiracy to exploit the princes for the benefit of the press, while somehow persuading the princes that they were the ones who would benefit by attending. As the newspapers never tire of reminding us, Black cohabits with Mark Bolland, his predecessor as PCC director and now deputy private secretary to Prince Charles. Who knows what they talk about after work? </p> <p>Lord Wakeham, the PCC's slippery-looking chairman, often claims that he seeks the same protection for a schoolboy from Accrington as he does for a royal prince at Eton. But he has made so many pleas to the press to respect the privacy of William that one feels he cannot get him off his mind. Even so, while the newspapers' recent gentle treatment of William is regarded by the PCC as one of the great successes of self-regulation, St James's Palace complained to the PCC last autumn that OK! magazine had broken the Code of Practice by publishing photographs of him on his adventure trip to Chile, showing him hiking and crossing a river. OK! argued that Chile was a public place and that the public had a right to know how the prince was preparing himself for his future role as monarch. </p> <p>All the same, the PCC upheld the royal complaint on the grounds that the pictures, taken by an unidentified freelancer, could have been got only as a result of persistent pursuit in breach of Clause 4 of the code. \"Prince William was not in a place where photographers would normally have been and must, therefore, have been followed there by foreign paparazzi,\" it concluded, though the prince did not look like a hunted man. \"It is incumbent under the code for all publications to check the provenance of such photographs.\" </p> <p>A short while before this, Anna Ford, the newsreader, and her astronaut boyfriend David Scott, complained about photographs taken of them in swim- wear on a beach in Majorca that were published first in the Daily Mail and later in OK! Their complaint was rejected, because the hotel beach in question was accessible to the public and therefore not private. The PCC decided that, although the pictures must have been taken with a long-lens camera and although it \"had a degree of sympathy with the complainants because the attention that they had attracted was clearly unwanted\", there was no breach of the code. </p> <p>So, unsurprisingly, Ford was not at the party, either. Prince William, however, was persuaded to attend as a \"thank you\" to the press for leaving him relatively undisturbed during his years at Eton. Given the way the press had earlier treated his family, this was unduly generous of him. Does one go out of one's way to thank a crocodile because it hasn't bitten one lately? And did he have to offer a titillating \"historic\" story by making this his first adult public engagement and a kind of filial endorsement of his father's relationship with Mrs Parker Bowles? </p> <p> Apart from celebrating the press's use of tighter self-regulation to see off political pressure for statutory controls, the party - held among the treasures of the Gilbert Collection in Somerset House - was officially intended to celebrate the PCC's success \"in consistently raising standards of reporting over the last decade\". One of the more surprising guests was Mrs Parker Bowles's son, Tom, who, it may be recalled, was the victim of an outrageous \"sting\" operation the summer before last when he was trapped by the News Of The World into telling a \"debutante\" how to obtain cocaine in Cannes. </p> <p>The News Of The World, at the time edited by Phil Hall, who openly admitted to using pretty young women - known popularly as \"Hall's Angels\" - to conduct such entrapment operations, claimed nauseatingly that this was in the public interest because Tom, although eight years older than William, was his \"close pal\" and therefore duty-bound \"to set an example of the best behaviour\". The case never came before the PCC, but Hall said last week that the commission was \"doing an excellent job\". Well he might think so.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Even as you read these words, someone, somewhere, is beggaring belief. I cannot prove this statistically, but I strongly suspect that belief has been beggared more frequently over the past few weeks than in any time in my long and languid experience. Have the police been called? I doubt it. Take these opening days of February. On the first, a man from Cowfold, West Sussex, wrote to the Telegraph alleging that the general condemnation of Professor Dick van Velzen for his part in the Alder Hey scandal, when his British equivalents were escaping unscathed, \"beggared belief\". On the same day, this very newspaper alleged that belief had been beggared by the behaviour of the London Stock Exchange over the Lloyds TSB bid for Abbey National. </p> <p>Since when, belief has been allegedly beggared again by (among others) the following: Corus, in its handling of steel industry closures (the Mirror); the conduct of two Australian conwomen, as observed by DC Jim Frost (Independent); the notion that a restaurant in Britain might call itself Seathwaite Farm (Jonathan Meades in the Times); the Alder Hey scandal (a White Van Man, interviewed by the Sun); the rapes and murders of David Mulcahy and John Duffy (the Mirror); the readiness of people, \"even in these dark ages\", to regard sexual perversion as acceptable in a political leader (letter to the Telegraph, after Francis Maude said the Tory party might one day be led by someone gay); the goggle-eyed fixation of a character in Almost Famous with rock hackery (Independent); the British government's readiness to accept a German government statement on Channel Islands deportees (letter to the Telegraph); Whitehall insistence that the crisis at Corus has nothing to do with the strong pound (Observer); inconsistent behaviour by Merrill Lynch (a City expert, also called Lynch); the idea that Labour's national executive is a warm and friendly place (letter from one of its members to the Guardian); and the government's attitude to the timetabling of Commons debate on the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill (a Tory spokesman). This excludes all references from the sports pages, of which there are plenty. In Smallweed's view, the media's abject - or bog standard, as we say nowadays - reliance on this clapped-out expression beggars belief. </p> <p><strong> In such</strong> swirling, vertiginous times as these, the persistence on a belief in the healing power of rhubarb could almost be considered a rock. If even half the claims so often advanced.</p> <p><strong> A lawyer writes: </strong> I act for Devil's Island, French Guyana. It has come to the island's notice that it has recently been compared in your column to somewhere called Hartlepool. We consider this statement actionable. Since when can this Hartlepool claim to have featured in many famous movies, among which we might name Condemned To Devil's Island, starring Ronald Colman; I Was A Prisoner On Devil's Island (Donald Woods); Strange Cargo, with Boris Karloff; Passage To Marseilles, with Humphrey Bogart; We're No Angels (ditto); Saint of Devil's Island (Eartha Kitt); Papillon (Steve McQueen); and I Escaped From Devil's Island (Jim Brown)? What is more, it is said that during the Napoleonic wars, the people of Hartlepool hanged a monkey believing it to be one of his agents. That this information was withheld from his readers by Smallweed speaks volumes about his bias. </p> <p><strong> Smallweed meekly confirms: </strong> Yes, I did know about the monkey, but I left it out to make room for more inspiring aspects of Hartlepool, like Peter Mandelson's scarf. After all, the language of priorities is the religion of journalism, as the Marquis of Vauvenargues once remarked in a different context. </p> <p> \"Verticalise your clutter\" - page heading in a Habitat catalogue. Honestly, it beggars belief that any commercial company should issue such a bog standard command to potential customers. Clutter, in my experience, is a precious and delicate thing best left alone until necessity strikes. But in any case: Verticalise! Where is their mandate for that? If no such word existed before, why do we need it now? Let any man living, Habitat salesman or otherwise, use such a term in my presence and he'll find himself swiftly horizontalised by my trusty right fist. </p> <p> A mobile ice-cream merchant in Brighton, proud heir to the race which once pedalled around on tricycles shouting \"Stop me and buy one\", is threatening to go out of business because Brighton council has classified him as a street trader rather than as a roundsman like the people who bring round our milk. Street traders have to buy licences; roundsmen don't. If he goes, he says, there will be soon be no peripatetic ice-cream salesmen left in Brighton and before long there won't be any anywhere else. I'm not sure how much I shall miss their ice cream, but I'll certainly miss the jolly, jingling tunes which used to announce their arrival, bringing light and life to many a dreary street, close, lane and avenue on a typically dim, bog standard, summer afternoon. </p> <p>Round our way, if I remember, it was usually an excerpt from Greensleeves, later superseded by the jolly Austrian song The Happy Wanderer, to which you could sing along when in the mood. I dare say other districts had other repertoires. You may perhaps have heard tell of the vendor whose van used to serenade queues for the Proms in South Kensington with snatches of the final movement allegro con brio of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, or the tender strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations. \"He's taking it even faster than Toscanini, certainly from bar 27 on,\" music lovers would say of his Beethoven; and when he got to the Elgar: \"Well, he's certainly brisker than Bernstein!\"; at which they would utter a knowing, conspiratorial laugh. I didn't much care for his portamenti, myself; but there comes a time, as you know... </p> <p> <strong>A pedant writes: </strong> As a former frequent attender at Henry Wood promenade concerts, I suggest that this story beggars belief. I very much doubt if this person ever existed. </p> <p> <strong>Smallweed counters with a truly odious smirk: </strong> Why, to be sure, old fellow, I never said that he did.

      "bodyText": "Even as you read these words, someone, somewhere, is beggaring belief. I cannot prove this statistically, but I strongly suspect that belief has been beggared more frequently over the past few weeks than in any time in my long and languid experience. Have the police been called? I doubt it. Take these opening days of February. On the first, a man from Cowfold, West Sussex, wrote to the Telegraph alleging that the general condemnation of Professor Dick van Velzen for his part in the Alder Hey scandal, when his British equivalents were escaping unscathed, \"beggared belief\". On the same day, this very newspaper alleged that belief had been beggared by the behaviour of the London Stock Exchange over the Lloyds TSB bid for Abbey National. Since when, belief has been allegedly beggared again by (among others) the following: Corus, in its handling of steel industry closures (the Mirror); the conduct of two Australian conwomen, as observed by DC Jim Frost (Independent); the notion that a restaurant in Britain might call itself Seathwaite Farm (Jonathan Meades in the Times); the Alder Hey scandal (a White Van Man, interviewed by the Sun); the rapes and murders of David Mulcahy and John Duffy (the Mirror); the readiness of people, \"even in these dark ages\", to regard sexual perversion as acceptable in a political leader (letter to the Telegraph, after Francis Maude said the Tory party might one day be led by someone gay); the goggle-eyed fixation of a character in Almost Famous with rock hackery (Independent); the British government's readiness to accept a German government statement on Channel Islands deportees (letter to the Telegraph); Whitehall insistence that the crisis at Corus has nothing to do with the strong pound (Observer); inconsistent behaviour by Merrill Lynch (a City expert, also called Lynch); the idea that Labour's national executive is a warm and friendly place (letter from one of its members to the Guardian); and the government's attitude to the timetabling of Commons debate on the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill (a Tory spokesman). This excludes all references from the sports pages, of which there are plenty. In Smallweed's view, the media's abject - or bog standard, as we say nowadays - reliance on this clapped-out expression beggars belief. In such swirling, vertiginous times as these, the persistence on a belief in the healing power of rhubarb could almost be considered a rock. If even half the claims so often advanced. A lawyer writes: I act for Devil's Island, French Guyana. It has come to the island's notice that it has recently been compared in your column to somewhere called Hartlepool. We consider this statement actionable. Since when can this Hartlepool claim to have featured in many famous movies, among which we might name Condemned To Devil's Island, starring Ronald Colman; I Was A Prisoner On Devil's Island (Donald Woods); Strange Cargo, with Boris Karloff; Passage To Marseilles, with Humphrey Bogart; We're No Angels (ditto); Saint of Devil's Island (Eartha Kitt); Papillon (Steve McQueen); and I Escaped From Devil's Island (Jim Brown)? What is more, it is said that during the Napoleonic wars, the people of Hartlepool hanged a monkey believing it to be one of his agents. That this information was withheld from his readers by Smallweed speaks volumes about his bias. Smallweed meekly confirms: Yes, I did know about the monkey, but I left it out to make room for more inspiring aspects of Hartlepool, like Peter Mandelson's scarf. After all, the language of priorities is the religion of journalism, as the Marquis of Vauvenargues once remarked in a different context. \"Verticalise your clutter\" - page heading in a Habitat catalogue. Honestly, it beggars belief that any commercial company should issue such a bog standard command to potential customers. Clutter, in my experience, is a precious and delicate thing best left alone until necessity strikes. But in any case: Verticalise! Where is their mandate for that? If no such word existed before, why do we need it now? Let any man living, Habitat salesman or otherwise, use such a term in my presence and he'll find himself swiftly horizontalised by my trusty right fist. A mobile ice-cream merchant in Brighton, proud heir to the race which once pedalled around on tricycles shouting \"Stop me and buy one\", is threatening to go out of business because Brighton council has classified him as a street trader rather than as a roundsman like the people who bring round our milk. Street traders have to buy licences; roundsmen don't. If he goes, he says, there will be soon be no peripatetic ice-cream salesmen left in Brighton and before long there won't be any anywhere else. I'm not sure how much I shall miss their ice cream, but I'll certainly miss the jolly, jingling tunes which used to announce their arrival, bringing light and life to many a dreary street, close, lane and avenue on a typically dim, bog standard, summer afternoon. Round our way, if I remember, it was usually an excerpt from Greensleeves, later superseded by the jolly Austrian song The Happy Wanderer, to which you could sing along when in the mood. I dare say other districts had other repertoires. You may perhaps have heard tell of the vendor whose van used to serenade queues for the Proms in South Kensington with snatches of the final movement allegro con brio of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, or the tender strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations. \"He's taking it even faster than Toscanini, certainly from bar 27 on,\" music lovers would say of his Beethoven; and when he got to the Elgar: \"Well, he's certainly brisker than Bernstein!\"; at which they would utter a knowing, conspiratorial laugh. I didn't much care for his portamenti, myself; but there comes a time, as you know... A pedant writes: As a former frequent attender at Henry Wood promenade concerts, I suggest that this story beggars belief. I very much doubt if this person ever existed. Smallweed counters with a truly odious smirk: Why, to be sure, old fellow, I never said that he did. I merely said you might have heard tell of him. If you hadn't before, you have now.

      "body": "<p>From the start of Pope John Paul II's reign, all his efforts were aimed towards the celebration in Rome of the year 2000, envisaged as a truly millennial event; indeed, the subject of the jubilee formed the opening paragraph of his first encyclical, Redemptor Hominis, in 1979. Against all the odds, he achieved his goal. Now, far from contemplating retirement, he is planning a busy schedule for several years into the future.</p> <p>The Pope's charisma is so strong that it tends to eclipse his actions. Yet what has kept him going, and remains a source of his energy, is nothing less than a radical restructuring of the church. While it would be easy to dismiss the jubilee celebrations as an exercise in triumphalism, they marked the unveiling of a new model for the church - the pontiff's legacy to the third millennium.</p> <p>For John Paul II, the crucial mission of the church today is a political one. A modern view of sexuality has been demonised as the \"culture of death\", leading to such aberrations (from the traditional Catholic viewpoint) as abortion, contraception (including emergency contraception in cases of rape), sterilisation (even for health reasons), homosexuality, sex education in schools, etc.</p> <p>This must be countered by a \"culture of life\", that is orthodox Catholic teaching which is binding for all man- kind because it is part of the \"natural law\". It is Rome's duty, as \"the universal and spiritual authority\", to impose this law.

      "bodyText": "From the start of Pope John Paul II's reign, all his efforts were aimed towards the celebration in Rome of the year 2000, envisaged as a truly millennial event; indeed, the subject of the jubilee formed the opening paragraph of his first encyclical, Redemptor Hominis, in 1979. Against all the odds, he achieved his goal. Now, far from contemplating retirement, he is planning a busy schedule for several years into the future. The Pope's charisma is so strong that it tends to eclipse his actions. Yet what has kept him going, and remains a source of his energy, is nothing less than a radical restructuring of the church. While it would be easy to dismiss the jubilee celebrations as an exercise in triumphalism, they marked the unveiling of a new model for the church - the pontiff's legacy to the third millennium. For John Paul II, the crucial mission of the church today is a political one. A modern view of sexuality has been demonised as the \"culture of death\", leading to such aberrations (from the traditional Catholic viewpoint) as abortion, contraception (including emergency contraception in cases of rape), sterilisation (even for health reasons), homosexuality, sex education in schools, etc. This must be countered by a \"culture of life\", that is orthodox Catholic teaching which is binding for all man- kind because it is part of the \"natural law\". It is Rome's duty, as \"the universal and spiritual authority\", to impose this law. It has therefore chosen as its new field of operations not the consciences of Catholics - the majority of whom are no longer listening - but the political arena. To achieve this ambitious goal of sweeping secular influence, this \"culture\" must be translated into civil legislation and, through a presence in legislatures, courts, academic and medical institutions, and the media, a vast lay army is required. Thus the term \"new evangelisation\" has become Vatican shorthand for the rapidly growing conservative movements and the communities cultivated over the last 20 years - Opus Dei, Focolare, Communion and Liberation, the Legionaries of Christ, and numerous others. When the Pope publicly confirmed his predilection for these groups at a massive rally in St Peter's Square on the feast of Pentecost in 1998, he described seeing them as a response to a \"world dominated by a secularised cult- ure\". Rome envisages a two-tier laity, dominated by a large activist elite strongly centralised in the Vatican. I n an interview last December, Guzman Carriquiry, under-secretary of the Vatican's Council for the Laity, showed that the Holy See is undismayed by the fact that a large number of Catholics no longer practice; it is the effectiveness of the elite that matters. \"It is critical for the lay faithful at the time of the dawn of the third millennium to be incorporated in the Christian communities to which they have been entrusted by the Providence of God,\" he suggested, indicating that reform groups, churchgoers who do not belong to movements, and fringe-members appear to be written off in the game-plan. On the one hand, therefore, the jubilee was a show of power - a May Day parade of the Pope's key divisions.

It transpires that they'd been expecting the American citizens from whom they took their samples to have many more genes than the nematode worm, but I suppose that's what happens when you base your research on the president. </p> <p>Worms were used in the genome project because it was presumed that their genetic code would be so simple to decipher that everyone could knock off early on Friday afternoon. But now the papers have had to report the uncomfortable truth that there's not that much difference between ourselves and the worm; the simple, primitive, stupid worm. Frankly worms have been patronised terribly in the media this week, and ought to take their case to the press complaints commission, except they won't of course, because they're so stupid. </p> <p>Alongside the illustration of the humble nematode, all the papers have featured similar drawings of a homo sapiens - though the human in the Sun had bigger breasts. The other creature that was analysed was the fruit fly. It turns out that these have around 13,000 genes, which sounds like more than they need. You'd have thought there were only two pieces of information you needed to give a fruit fly: 1) You fly. 2) You like fruit. And then simplest of all was yeast with 6,000 genes which was only analysed so they could make the French scientist taste Marmite. </p> <p>Whereas we humans, we're so clever, surely we must have millions and millions of genes? Not so apparently, we only have five times more than the yeast and the scientists tell us that we only need 11% of those. The rest are all junk apparently, although I would be reluctant to throw them out just yet. </p> <p>The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that if less information is genetically inherited, then more of our behaviour must be determined by social factors. So now we know - there is no gene that says you'll have a liking for the Bay City Rollers and tartan flares; it's because you grew up in Scotland in the 70s. There's nothing in the male's genetic make-up that instructs him to leave two bits of sweetcorn at the bottom of the sink after he's washed up. There is no female gene that makes her want to have a taste of everyone else's pudding. Most of our behaviour is acquired. People who say that our behaviour is predetermined only say that because their mum and dad did. The nature versus nurture question is as old as human society itself (unless it's even older and we inherited the debate from a bunch of precocious gorillas). </p> <p> But now the balance has shifted irreversibly in favour of those who believe that people are the same all over the world. The multimillion dollar genome research project has reached the same conclusion as the lyrics of Ebony and Ivory. It is, of course, a left versus right issue. Conservative politics are based on the philosophy that people just are the way they are, and that it's their own fault if they don't do more with their lives. </p> <p>George Bush is president because he worked harder and was more brilliant than some black woman who grew up in a one-parent family in Detroit - end of story. If you believe people are born good or bad or clever or stupid then there is no point in trying to change the world. The Australian penal colonies were founded on the belief that there was simply a criminal class who begat more criminals and if they could all be exported then crime would disappear from society. </p> <p>The idea got a huge cheer at the 1800 Conservative party conference, though it would probably be considered a bit liberal today. If it were true then modern day Sydney would still be full of people stealing silk handkerchiefs and singing \"You've gotta pick a pocket or two!\" In reality only parts of it are like that. </p> <p>Irrespective of how many genes we have, the genome project has confirmed what many of us had instinctively known for a very long time; that nurture counts for more than nature. The debate is over for ever; clearly the worm just wriggles around in mud all day because he just never got the breaks in life. </p> <p>But at a time when the fate of all the creatures on the planet depends on us, a little humility would not do humankind any harm, even if it's hard to accept that we have so much in common with such a basic life form as yeast. After all what has yeast ever done? It just reproduces in enormous numbers, consumes everything within its environment and then finally poisons itself with the toxins it has produced. You could hardly imagine us humans ever doing anything so stupid. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Conservative politics are based on the philosophy that people just are the way they are, and that it's their own fault if they don't do more with their lives. George Bush is president because he worked harder and was more brilliant than some black woman who grew up in a one-parent family in Detroit - end of story. If you believe people are born good or bad or clever or stupid then there is no point in trying to change the world. The Australian penal colonies were founded on the belief that there was simply a criminal class who begat more criminals and if they could all be exported then crime would disappear from society. The idea got a huge cheer at the 1800 Conservative party conference, though it would probably be considered a bit liberal today. If it were true then modern day Sydney would still be full of people stealing silk handkerchiefs and singing \"You've gotta pick a pocket or two!\" In reality only parts of it are like that. Irrespective of how many genes we have, the genome project has confirmed what many of us had instinctively known for a very long time; that nurture counts for more than nature. The debate is over for ever; clearly the worm just wriggles around in mud all day because he just never got the breaks in life. But at a time when the fate of all the creatures on the planet depends on us, a little humility would not do humankind any harm, even if it's hard to accept that we have so much in common with such a basic life form as yeast. After all what has yeast ever done? It just reproduces in enormous numbers, consumes everything within its environment and then finally poisons itself with the toxins it has produced. You could hardly imagine us humans ever doing anything so stupid. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The US civil rights commission was yesterday investigating allegations by the BBC's Newsnight that thousands of mainly black voters in Florida were disenfranchised in the November election because of wholesale errors by a private data services company. Information supplied by the company, Database Technologies (DBT), led to tens of thousands of Floridians being removed from the electoral roll on the grounds that they had felonies on their records. However, a Guardian investigation in December confirmed by Newsnight found that the list was riddled with mistakes that led to thousands of voters - a disproportionate number of them black - being wrongly disenfranchised. The scale of the errors, and their skewed effect on black, overwhelmingly Democratic voters, cost Al Gore thousands of votes in Florida in an election that George Bush won by just 537 votes. Moreover the Florida state government, where Mr Bush's brother Jeb is governor, did nothing to correct the errors, and may have encouraged them.

DBT was paid $4.3m for its purge of the voters' roll, but company officials confirmed that they did not call voters they had included on their list to check if they had identified the right person.

Unable to make a success of the family opticians' business after his father died in 1954, Mr Steinberg found more success in the lower end of the betting shop trade, gradually acquiring 10 shops across Ulster. </p> <p>By the early 1970s, he decided to leave the increasingly violent province behind and expand his business across the Irish Sea - firstly with two shops on the Isle of Man, then four in Yorkshire, followed by 11 in Liverpool and a casino in Stockport. Still mainly focused on areas ignored by the big three - William Hills, Ladbrokes and Coral - Stanley now has an estate of some 645 shops across the UK, and its chairman is regarded as an elder statesman of the industry. </p> <p>Since floating his business on the stock exchange in 1986, Mr Steinberg has won the support of a number of institutional investors - including Mercury Asset Management and Standard Life Investments both of which hold stakes of more than 5% - and Stanley now has an annual turnover of \u00a3571m. In 1997, he even established a Centre for Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Salford as part of his efforts to bring an air of respectability to the industry. </p> <p>As if to underline Stanley's establishment credentials, in 1999 the company bought Capital Corporation, owner of three prestigious London casinos including Crockfords, the eighteenth century private gaming club in Mayfair. </p> <p>On a personal level, despite not attending university, Mr Steinberg shows all the signs of a well-polished education. His interests are in music and art and stamp collecting rather than the turf or the roulette wheel. Among the many works of art in his oak-panelled Liverpool offices, a model of Red Rum - a horse that lost Stanley a considerable sum - is among the few items that betray a connection with gambling. </p> <p>That said, Mr Steinberg, who describes himself as \"a dyed-in-the-wool bookmaker\", is an unusual establishment figure. He has resisted pressure to move Stanley's headquarters closer to the City, insisting on remaining in Liverpool, at the centre of Stanley's betting shop estate. He is also happy to talk about the importance of his religion to him. </p> <p>But he is most passionate on the subject of politics, and he gladly takes the opportunity to congratulate fellow gaming magnate, Stuart Wheeler, on his \u00a35m donation to the Tory party last month. \"For a number of years I was the only substantial donor to the Conservative party from the gambling industry,\" he says. \"I am delighted that Stuart is there as well.\" </p> <p>Mr Steinberg's politics are driven by much the same convictions he applies to business. Summing up his political philosophy, he says: \"If people spend money, they are entitled to be taxed on it. If they don't spend it they shouldn't have the same degree of taxation. I am a Conservative with a very large 'C'.\" </p> <p>Asked what odds he would put on William Hague making it first past the winning post at a May election, he groans. \"I was afraid you were going to ask me that,\" he says. \"I believe we can win it - and for quite a number of reasons. We do need a swing of 8% to 9%, but you have got to bear in mind that during the elections there have been so far [this parliamentary term] - not the polls and so on - we have done very well, albeit on low turn outs.

But the answer belies the central role he still plays at Stanley - in which he retains a stake of more than 20%. \"I may take things a bit easier, spend more time enjoying my grandchildren,\" he says. \"But so many of those who retire quickly go to seed.\" </p> <p>A lifelong businessman, he appears most relaxed when entertaining speculation about Stanley's potential for future acquisitions - London Clubs' capital-based casinos as well as the Tote's and Coral's betting shop estates are mentioned.</p>",

The convoy, carrying about 250 people and escorted by five Swedish armoured personnel carriers and a medical detachment, was attacked yesterday morning near Podujevo, 25 miles north-east of Pristina. The families - Kosovo Serbs who had left the province fearing ethnic Albanian attack - had planned to visit the graves of relatives in the Serb enclave of Gracanica today, the Orthodox Day of the Dead, and to celebrate mass there. Brigadier Robert Fry, a senior British member of the peacekeeping force, called the explosion \"a ruthless pre-meditated attack of mass murder\". It was the second most deadly attack motivated by ethnic hatreds since mid-1999, when large-scale violence ended with the pullout of Yugoslav troops from the province. Swedish first aid teams helped the injured at the scene and the most serious cases were evacuated by helicopter to a US army hospital. The condition of 10 of the injured was said to be severe. British troops investigating the bomb said it contained 68kg (150lb) of explosive. It had been hidden in a culvert under the road and detonated by wire. Clothes and children's books could be seen among the shards of metal and glass scattered over the road. Gorica Stjepanovic, 24, who survived the attack with eye injuries, said that two Nato armoured personnel carriers had already driven over the bomb. \"All of a sudden, everything burst, the bus seemed to have fallen apart,\" she said. \"Blood was dripping from the roof, we were trying to see whose blood.

Profit is an enabler, because it takes people and peoples beyond subsistence levels to the amenities of life, to comfort and culture, to new knowledge and new possibilities.

Even so it is not as disquieting as the fact that the chairman of a City company can earn in a year as much as 50 or 100 nurses do. Why is that so? Defenders of high-flying businessmen point out that they have responsible jobs, producing wealth which, indirectly through taxation, helps pay nurses' wages. But is the chairman of a business worth 50 nurses? Indeed, is he worth one? The same, with even more of a barb, might be asked about football players and pop stars. </p> <p>But even footballers' and businessmen's salary levels are not as disquieting as the fact that announcements about the latest human genome discoveries have been muddied because one of the teams involved, being a private company, is intent on turning what it knows into a cash profit. There is no mystery about why it is wrong that such a motive should interfere in the quest for fundamental knowledge about mankind. The mapping of the human genome is, without question, one of the most exciting and important scientific advances in history, and it promises treasures both in theoretical and practical understanding which will benefit every present and future individual. The private genome company asks us to buy, at a premium, vital knowledge about ourselves.

On the face of it this is an horrific example of the evil men do in the name of profit, and it is so intolerable that even some of the large investors in pharmaceutical companies have begun to question the ethics of their behaviour. But the complication is that whereas it is unequivocally wrong that people in need of available medicines cannot get them because of their cost, it is too simple to say that the pharmaceutical companies should alone be blamed. </p> <p>The reason is well known: developing new drugs is enormously costly in money and time, made more so by the safety controls quite properly required by governments; and it is risky, because a half-billion dollar development programme might lead to nothing. To compensate themselves the pharmaceutical companies accordingly charge whatever the market will bear, and fight to protect their patents. </p> <p>Because the need to help the sick in developing countries is urgent, and because it is unrealistic to expect the pharmaceuticals to solve the problem by suddenly becoming charitable, it follows that it is up to us - to western governments and individuals, the latter by donating to aid organisations - to find imaginative ways of privileging poor countries in the battle for health, including buying or subsidising drugs for them. </p> <p>Fingering the pharmaceuticals as profiteers is right, but must not distract attention from our own responsibilities; we share the opprobrium if our fellows die because they lack the price of a pill.

      "body": "<p>She looked and sounded as if she'd just fallen out of an episode of Friends (\"I'm so excited you've let me play here in London, it's so awesome\"), but the moment Rachel Z's fingers hit the keyboard, she saw off such frivolous notions. Z, who first emerged as a Herbie Hancock protege, is at Ronnie Scott's in London for a week with her own trio. It is an awesomely proficient and intuitive ensemble featuring the soft-toned bassist Miriam Sullivan, and a drummer of fierce clarity and bold imagination in Alison Miller. </p> <p>The group devoted its show (as has its current CD, On the Milky Way Express) to celebrating the music of the former Weather Report and Miles Davis saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter. Shorter's oblique, rhythmically devious pieces (Footprints, a postbop standard, is the most famous) hook into popular idioms - Latin music particularly - while maintaining an ambiguity of shape very attractive to improvisers. The trio made the best possible use of the spacious compositions, frequently concealing them within the momentum of collective improvisations. </p> <p>Z herself is a devastating performer, with the sweeping capacity for shapeliness and storytelling in a solo that characterises the very best jazz improvisers. But the ensemble operates as an integrated whole throughout, even when they aren't all playing together - as when the leader stepped out of sight behind the open piano lid during a ruminative Sullivan bass solo, to make sure the audience was watching her partner only. Not afraid to make the jazz club audience wait for its fixes of swing, Z opened with stealthy, transparent chords before drummer Miller intervened with a bumping pulse. Miller then opened out into a tumbling stream of cymbal accents, snare-drum offbeats and tom-tom rumbles that recalled the methods of Jack DeJohnette.

      "bodyText": "She looked and sounded as if she'd just fallen out of an episode of Friends (\"I'm so excited you've let me play here in London, it's so awesome\"), but the moment Rachel Z's fingers hit the keyboard, she saw off such frivolous notions. Z, who first emerged as a Herbie Hancock protege, is at Ronnie Scott's in London for a week with her own trio. It is an awesomely proficient and intuitive ensemble featuring the soft-toned bassist Miriam Sullivan, and a drummer of fierce clarity and bold imagination in Alison Miller. The group devoted its show (as has its current CD, On the Milky Way Express) to celebrating the music of the former Weather Report and Miles Davis saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter. Shorter's oblique, rhythmically devious pieces (Footprints, a postbop standard, is the most famous) hook into popular idioms - Latin music particularly - while maintaining an ambiguity of shape very attractive to improvisers. The trio made the best possible use of the spacious compositions, frequently concealing them within the momentum of collective improvisations. Z herself is a devastating performer, with the sweeping capacity for shapeliness and storytelling in a solo that characterises the very best jazz improvisers. But the ensemble operates as an integrated whole throughout, even when they aren't all playing together - as when the leader stepped out of sight behind the open piano lid during a ruminative Sullivan bass solo, to make sure the audience was watching her partner only. Not afraid to make the jazz club audience wait for its fixes of swing, Z opened with stealthy, transparent chords before drummer Miller intervened with a bumping pulse. Miller then opened out into a tumbling stream of cymbal accents, snare-drum offbeats and tom-tom rumbles that recalled the methods of Jack DeJohnette. She was full of ideas, turning the snare on and off in the midst of a clattering tattoo, fitfully erupting with flat, snare-off patterns like an admonishing handclap in a noisy room. Z is a comprehensive reference book of much recent jazz piano, with Herbie Hancock's harmonic awareness and a little of Chick Corea's embroidery, but the real story is her own.

Some of the change has been consciously campaigned for in the gardening press: there has been an entertaining running battle mounted by Christopher Lloyd against received wisdom and ghastly good taste, against the timid palette of so many gardens.

And it is inevitable that, if a certain flower begins to look good in the house, it will in time begin to look good again in the garden. </p> <p>I well remember a gardening friend, 10 years ago, saying gently and forgivingly, \"Now, what's all that about?\", gazing into a bed in which common marigolds had been allowed to get, perhaps, out of hand. But the common pot marigold can hold its own extremely well in a common modern vase. Calendula officinalis is the name, and I recommend (no 31) the strain called \"Indian Prince\". </p> <p>For a vivid illustration of this shift in floral taste, you can compare two books which would seem to be addressing the same subject. The Flower Arranger's Garden by Rosemary Verey (Conran Octopus, 1989) presents us with plans for borders and island beds which, without undue disturbance, can be plundered for the house. But you would have to be very clever to guess, just from looking at them, that these designs had been made with the flower arranger in mind. The emphasis is on shrubs and perennials, and only a handful of annuals makes its way into the list of essential flowers. By comparison, The Cutting Garden by Sarah Raven (Frances Lincoln, 1996) proposes a kind of design in which the function of the plot announces itself boldly. Flowers are planted in straight lines, as they might be in allotments, or in frank, comprehensible clumps. This is more than what the Americans sometimes call a posy patch: it could well constitute your whole garden. But if every flower is chosen with an eye to its usefulness for cutting, it follows - or it seems to follow - that the list of flowers will be different from those you would expect in a garden laid out without such a purpose in mind. </p> <p>Many flowers mentioned earlier in this series come into such a scheme: basic, apparently simple-minded choices like Cornflowers, Nasturtiums, Love-in-a-mist, Forget-me-nots, Sunflowers and Delphiniums. And perhaps to some tastes the list, when set out like that, might begin to look infantile. Who can imagine that it is sophisticated to grow snapdragons? Perhaps it is not. But when I first saw the buckets full of giant snapdragons for sale in New York, I wondered why I was not growing (no 32) Antirrhinum majus in my garden. You need an F1 Hybrid seed for the full three-foot scale. </p> <p>Flowers that remind one of hot continental summers include the Mexican Sunflower mentioned previously, Tithonia rotundifolia , which always brings back Giverny for me (a garden I associate very much with flowers raised from seed, rather than with waterlilies), and (no 33) Cosmos bipinnatus \"Purity\", the white version. We grow the crimson \"Dazzler\" as well. These we tend to dot around the borders, where they do especially happily in warm summers, as does the Spider Flower (no 34), Cleome spinosa , available in purple, pink and white. South America and the West Indies are where it is at home. It packs a mean thorn. </p> <p>These are plants which have earned their place in the garden, long before the question of cutting them arose. And the same is true of that native of Texas and Louisiana, (no 35) Gaura lindheimeri : you want to see it waving in the breeze, giving a pink shimmer to the border, long before you want - if indeed you do - to see it in a vase. But I would think twice before letting (no 36) the Zinnias, out of the posy patch. These are what you see grown in straight rows in France, and that is how they look good - or in a simple jug. Cactus-flowered are the ones we grow. </p> <p>Always on the look out for things to grow near roses, and hoping that they will be long-flowering, I was delighted last year with (no 37) Salvia viridis \"Blue\" from Sarah Raven's list. The blue is in the bracts, brilliant Moroccan blue the catalogue calls it, and puts it in the top 10 for foliage. It will seed itself around, which is one reason why I want it. Another reason is its flowering season - May to October. This used to be called S. horminium . That it lasts indefinitely in a vase is a prospect that gives me the horrors. </p> <p>Sweet Scabious (no 38), or Scabiosa atropurpurea , which some do call Egyptian Rose, though truth to tell it is South African. One for the Black Garden, it grew generously for us. Among the numerous columbines, Chiltern Seeds is offering (no 39) Aquilegia alpina \"Hensol Harebell\", a particularly desirable blue. And, if obliged to restrict myself to one Sweet Pea (no 40) it would be the one listed by Sarah Raven as Lathyrus Matucana (syn.

      "body": "<p>In a dusty field in the village of Adhoi, white tents flap emptily in the wind. Nearby, young boys fly kites, cows graze in the dirt and the sun beats down. </p> <p>In the days after the devastating earthquake that wrecked this part of western India on January 26, soldiers arrived and erected the tents as emergency shelter. </p> <p>But the village's influential upper caste Patel community refused to move in. There was nothing wrong with the tents. The problem was the new neighbours 15 metres away: Adhoi's Dalits (untouchables) who had already set up a makeshift camp using old bedsheets and bamboo poles. </p> <p>As the days went by the tents the army had set up remained eerily vacant. Eventually the soldiers took most of them away. </p> <p>\"Forcing people to live with different communities would not be the right thing to do,\" Sanjay Kumar Singh, commandant of the Rapid Action Force unit stationed in the village, said. </p> <p>\"There might be a law and order problem. After all, these people have lived apart for centuries.\" </p> <p>Three weeks after the quake ripped across the state of Gujarat, killing at least 30,000, it is clear that in the villages at least, shared adversity has done little to break down old prejudices. </p> <p>From lower caste Hindus and poor Muslim families there are mounting accusations that much of the aid that has cascaded into Kutch, the worst affected district, has been withheld from them. </p> <p>In the hours after the tremors reduced Adhoi's main street to rubble, burying a parade of small girls, villagers worked together to retrieve and cremate more than 400 dead. </p> <p>But, the poor and their leaders allege, when the first aid trucks appeared the next day members of the dominant Jain and Patel communities diverted them towards their own people. </p> <p>\"For the first three days we had nothing to eat,\" a Dalit villager, Pravin Bharwad, complained. \"They told the trucks to avoid us and said we were disease-ridden.\" </p> <p>The Jains started a relief kitchen, but only the upper castes were encouraged to eat there, he said. </p> <p>Two days later, a swami (holy man) arrived at Adhoi with three trucks and began a separate food camp for the \"backward\" castes. </p> <p>\"If it wasn't for the swami we would have died of hunger,\" Mr Bharwad said. </p> <p>Though Adhoi is completely destroyed, the communities now refuse to live with each other. The Dalits' camp is to the north. Next door are the Kolis, another \"backward\" caste. </p> <p>The Patels and the Jains have set up camp down the road to the right, close to the village's shattered and pigeon-infested temple. The shepherd caste is somewhere else. </p> <p>Ten thousand people now live in a series of discrete encampments. \"This is what they have learned from their forefathers and have been following for ages. The divide simply can't vanish in a fortnight,\" said BC Joshi, an upper caste Brahmin resident. </p> <p>Most villagers are reluctant to talk about caste, or simply deny that the issue exists. \"All castes use our kitchen,\" Khetshibahi Charla, who runs the Jain relief camp, insisted. </p> <p>But across this barren region similar stories have emerged of village chiefs giving relief supplies meant for the whole village only to their own group. </p> <p>In Bhuj, the old town closest to the quake's epicentre, Muslims have complained that they have been forced to say the Hindu invocation \"Jai Shri Ram\" before being given anything to eat at camps run by Hindu nationalist volunteers. </p> <p>Gujarat was the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, who fought against the evils of caste. Now it is a stronghold of the Hindu right and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). </p> <p>The state's BJP chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, denies there is bias. And there is no doubt that in the early days of the disaster volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and other rightwing Hindu groups, helped to cremate the dead and tend the injured. </p> <p>But as the crisis subsides, politics has taken over. \"I have personally witnessed BJP volunteers hijacking relief trucks as they came into Bhuj,\" a Congress party councillor, Fakirabhai Khumbar, said. </p> <p>Foreign aid workers admit they fear that Dalits and Muslims may lose out. \"The Muslims are very vulnerable. We are worried about what will happen when the monsoon comes,\" a World Food Programme official said. </p> <p>Back in Adhoi at dusk, the ruined high street is deserted. \"Everybody has left, apart from the pigs and the dogs,\" Sunil Sharma, a helper at the Dalit food camp, said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a dusty field in the village of Adhoi, white tents flap emptily in the wind. Nearby, young boys fly kites, cows graze in the dirt and the sun beats down. In the days after the devastating earthquake that wrecked this part of western India on January 26, soldiers arrived and erected the tents as emergency shelter. But the village's influential upper caste Patel community refused to move in. There was nothing wrong with the tents. The problem was the new neighbours 15 metres away: Adhoi's Dalits (untouchables) who had already set up a makeshift camp using old bedsheets and bamboo poles. As the days went by the tents the army had set up remained eerily vacant. Eventually the soldiers took most of them away. \"Forcing people to live with different communities would not be the right thing to do,\" Sanjay Kumar Singh, commandant of the Rapid Action Force unit stationed in the village, said. \"There might be a law and order problem. After all, these people have lived apart for centuries.\" Three weeks after the quake ripped across the state of Gujarat, killing at least 30,000, it is clear that in the villages at least, shared adversity has done little to break down old prejudices. From lower caste Hindus and poor Muslim families there are mounting accusations that much of the aid that has cascaded into Kutch, the worst affected district, has been withheld from them. In the hours after the tremors reduced Adhoi's main street to rubble, burying a parade of small girls, villagers worked together to retrieve and cremate more than 400 dead. But, the poor and their leaders allege, when the first aid trucks appeared the next day members of the dominant Jain and Patel communities diverted them towards their own people. \"For the first three days we had nothing to eat,\" a Dalit villager, Pravin Bharwad, complained. \"They told the trucks to avoid us and said we were disease-ridden.\" The Jains started a relief kitchen, but only the upper castes were encouraged to eat there, he said. Two days later, a swami (holy man) arrived at Adhoi with three trucks and began a separate food camp for the \"backward\" castes. \"If it wasn't for the swami we would have died of hunger,\" Mr Bharwad said. Though Adhoi is completely destroyed, the communities now refuse to live with each other. The Dalits' camp is to the north. Next door are the Kolis, another \"backward\" caste. The Patels and the Jains have set up camp down the road to the right, close to the village's shattered and pigeon-infested temple. The shepherd caste is somewhere else. Ten thousand people now live in a series of discrete encampments. \"This is what they have learned from their forefathers and have been following for ages. The divide simply can't vanish in a fortnight,\" said BC Joshi, an upper caste Brahmin resident. Most villagers are reluctant to talk about caste, or simply deny that the issue exists. \"All castes use our kitchen,\" Khetshibahi Charla, who runs the Jain relief camp, insisted. But across this barren region similar stories have emerged of village chiefs giving relief supplies meant for the whole village only to their own group. In Bhuj, the old town closest to the quake's epicentre, Muslims have complained that they have been forced to say the Hindu invocation \"Jai Shri Ram\" before being given anything to eat at camps run by Hindu nationalist volunteers. Gujarat was the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, who fought against the evils of caste. Now it is a stronghold of the Hindu right and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The state's BJP chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, denies there is bias. And there is no doubt that in the early days of the disaster volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and other rightwing Hindu groups, helped to cremate the dead and tend the injured. But as the crisis subsides, politics has taken over. \"I have personally witnessed BJP volunteers hijacking relief trucks as they came into Bhuj,\" a Congress party councillor, Fakirabhai Khumbar, said. Foreign aid workers admit they fear that Dalits and Muslims may lose out. \"The Muslims are very vulnerable. We are worried about what will happen when the monsoon comes,\" a World Food Programme official said. Back in Adhoi at dusk, the ruined high street is deserted. \"Everybody has left, apart from the pigs and the dogs,\" Sunil Sharma, a helper at the Dalit food camp, said.",

      "bodyText": "An attempt by the prosecution to prevent the reporting of its efforts to suppress key documents in the forthcoming high-profile trial of renegade MI5 officer, David Shayler, was dismissed yesterday. A hearing at Chelmsford crown court marked the opening shots of a trial - due to start before May - which government lawyers privately admit will sound the death knell of the existing Official Secrets Act. Judge Alan Moses refused an application by Nigel Sweeney QC, for the prosecution, to stop the media from disclosing anything said at yesterday's hearing. The judge heard complaints by Michael Mansfield QC, Mr Shayler's counsel, that they were not given sufficient access to MI5 documents at the heart of the case. Mr Sweeney argued these were so sensitive that if fully disclosed lives would be put at risk. Mr Moses said that the MI5 documents - leaked to the Mail on Sunday in 1997 - had already been seen by Mr Shayler. \"These are documents your client has already seen unredacted [parts blacked out].\" Mr Shayler is alleged to have taken the 29 documents - showing how MI5 kept files on prominent Labour politicians and acted against a suspected Libyan intelligence officer - out of the agency's headquarters in 1997. They were subsequently sent back to MI5. The defence wants ready access to them during the trial. Mr Mansfield also told the court that Mr Shayler acted out of \"necessity\" to expose wrongdoings in the security and intelligence services. The trial is due to start at the Old Bailey on April 23.

Is he more relaxed now the champion of all things Euro is distracted by the Hammond inquiry and devoting himself to the Clear the Notting Hill One campaign?</p> <p>More likely the prime minister's bullishness about the referendum - and its \"Gordon and I\" wrapping - brought the chancellor out of his corner. Or is he simply cheerful about \"his\" brilliant economic indicators and excited about his coming budget? Gordon Brown remains inscrutably confident, or confidently inscrutable, and therefore does it his way. Which means not only breaking silence but again distancing himself from the europhiles as much as from the sceptics.</p> <p>He gained headlines of which Michael Portillo would not have been ashamed. \"Brown attacks Brussels for rebuke on spending\" and \"Brown delights eurosceptics with his ticking off\" in the Independent. \"Brown tells EU meddlers to mind their own business\" said the Daily Mail. \"Brown sees off Brussels attack on spending\" reported the Guardian. In its story, the Financial Times said Brown \"fiercely rejected\" European commission criticism of his forecast budget deficit.</p> <p>For the first time in many months, you could not distinguish between the eurosceptic and the Euro-supportive press. They united under the British flag and the satisfaction of telling Brussels where to go. It was, said the Daily Mail, \"an important test of strength\" against the \"high-handed Brussels attempt to meddle in (our) economic plans\".</p> <p>Britain and Ireland were brought together by both being on the receiving end of commission criticism of their conduct of their economies. One in the euro, the other outside; Britain was criticised for planning a small budget deficit; Ireland was told to amend its budget in line with EU guidelines to avoid \"economic overheating and inflationary pressures\" (FT).</p> <p>It takes a heavyweight politician to unite an enthusiastic member of the euro-zone (Ireland) with a wavering outsider (Britain), to generate applause among the eurosceptics when you are chancellor in a government moving towards euro-membership, to make the \"now you see what we mean\" words of the opposition seem a little feeble. Or perhaps it takes a commission with under-developed political sense.</p> <p>There was some interesting spin put on the inflation figures, the eurosceptics now having to employ the tactic of praising the government's economic management in order to reinforce their anti-euro case. \"Stunning economic figures,\" said the Sun, \"showed Britain's economy is booming\" and proved \"we don't need the euro\".</p> <p>However, for all its anti-euro campaigning, the Sun did advise its readers to vote Labour last time. The Daily Telegraph, which will never do such a thing, was therefore a more unlikely candidate to praise the economic performance of the government. Again, it seemed forced into this position by its greater passion for stopping entry into the euro.</p> <p>So the newspaper gave great prominence to a story declaring that \"Buoyant Britain passes the test for joining EMU\". The hyperbole continued: \"Britain passes with flying colours on all scores. It has the healthiest public finances of all the major countries in the EU.\" It also said: \"On inflation Britain is a star performer.'</p> <p>Another political heavyweight joined the euro-debate this week. The Independent published an article by Kenneth Clarke, yesterday's Tory because of his dislocation from his party's attitude to Europe. In it the former chancellor bemoaned the lack of a proper debate about the euro, and blamed his successor for not answering \"all those Eurosceptic lies\".</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University</p>",

He gained headlines of which Michael Portillo would not have been ashamed. \"Brown attacks Brussels for rebuke on spending\" and \"Brown delights eurosceptics with his ticking off\" in the Independent. \"Brown tells EU meddlers to mind their own business\" said the Daily Mail. \"Brown sees off Brussels attack on spending\" reported the Guardian. In its story, the Financial Times said Brown \"fiercely rejected\" European commission criticism of his forecast budget deficit. For the first time in many months, you could not distinguish between the eurosceptic and the Euro-supportive press. They united under the British flag and the satisfaction of telling Brussels where to go. It was, said the Daily Mail, \"an important test of strength\" against the \"high-handed Brussels attempt to meddle in (our) economic plans\". Britain and Ireland were brought together by both being on the receiving end of commission criticism of their conduct of their economies. One in the euro, the other outside; Britain was criticised for planning a small budget deficit; Ireland was told to amend its budget in line with EU guidelines to avoid \"economic overheating and inflationary pressures\" (FT). It takes a heavyweight politician to unite an enthusiastic member of the euro-zone (Ireland) with a wavering outsider (Britain), to generate applause among the eurosceptics when you are chancellor in a government moving towards euro-membership, to make the \"now you see what we mean\" words of the opposition seem a little feeble. Or perhaps it takes a commission with under-developed political sense. There was some interesting spin put on the inflation figures, the eurosceptics now having to employ the tactic of praising the government's economic management in order to reinforce their anti-euro case. \"Stunning economic figures,\" said the Sun, \"showed Britain's economy is booming\" and proved \"we don't need the euro\". However, for all its anti-euro campaigning, the Sun did advise its readers to vote Labour last time. The Daily Telegraph, which will never do such a thing, was therefore a more unlikely candidate to praise the economic performance of the government. Again, it seemed forced into this position by its greater passion for stopping entry into the euro. So the newspaper gave great prominence to a story declaring that \"Buoyant Britain passes the test for joining EMU\". The hyperbole continued: \"Britain passes with flying colours on all scores. It has the healthiest public finances of all the major countries in the EU.\" It also said: \"On inflation Britain is a star performer.' Another political heavyweight joined the euro-debate this week. The Independent published an article by Kenneth Clarke, yesterday's Tory because of his dislocation from his party's attitude to Europe. In it the former chancellor bemoaned the lack of a proper debate about the euro, and blamed his successor for not answering \"all those Eurosceptic lies\". \u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University",

      "bodyText": "The government's expected plans for courts to sit during evenings and even through the night, to speed up the system, were under threat yesterday, after a union said the proposal was contrary to the interests of justice. The plans for so-called night courts, an idea pioneered in New York, are to be announced later this month. But the general secretary of a union representing magistrates court staff said the plans amounted to a \"major change\" in employment contracts and warned of non-cooperation if staff were compelled to work into the evening or through the night. The plans for night courts appeal to ministers as a way of dealing with an increase in street robberies and alcohol-related crimes. Britain's top police officer, Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has thrown his weight behind the plan, saying it was a way to combat youth crime. Yesterday the home secretary, Jack Straw, signalled that longer magistrates court hours had support from the government. Mr Straw said: \"In big city centres there will be extended court hours, obviously in the evening. In some cases they may literally be around the clock... it is a question of trying out ideas.\" A government review of the criminal justice system, involving Mr Straw, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, is expected to be unveiled later this month. The idea of 24-hour court sittings originated in New York, where up to 300 cases are dealt with in a night. Sir John said he had seen the 24-hour courts system in operation in New York and believed it could work here. \"You ensure people go through the system very quickly. When they are arrested they go straight to court, whatever the time, day or night. It saves time. It allows you to process them in a far, far quicker way. \"Some of these persistent offenders, these youngsters - society, quite honestly, needs a rest from them.\" Mr Straw was \"very keen\" on the idea of night courts or a similar way of tackling persistent young offenders, Sir John said. The government promised to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders from 142 days to 71 days. Recent figures showed that the average in October last year was 94 days.

He told the court: \"I've been in charge nine years, made a lot of mistakes, been through a lot of managers - and still had the guts to have another go and get the best manager available to me and tried to do it again after being spat upon, shouted at and called all sorts of names.\" Sir Alan said that Mr Graham knew when he signed on, with an initial spending budget of \u00a312m, that it was a slow rebuilding process. He said that decisions about buying players were down to the board of directors. \"The company had its own coffers and bank facilities, and the board of directors wanted to restrict the activities of the company within what it could afford to do.\" Sir Alan said he had never refused to pay for a player requested by Mr Graham - and Mr Graham had never complained that he did not have enough money. \"Every single penny generated in that football club is devoted to buying players,\" he added. \"Everything that is surplus goes to buying players and paying their wages.\" Sir Alan said that he had only once had cause for complaint over the financial press but everything changed once he went into the football business. \"As my dear old mother said, 'you lie down with dogs and you get fleas'. I tell you, for the last nine years, I've been itching badly.\" The newspaper - which was ordered to pay the costs, unofficially estimated at \u00a3400,000 - was granted leave to appeal. Afterwards Sir Alan said: \"I am just pleased it is all over. It has been a terrible time. \"Money has never been of interest to me and neither has my selling my stake in Spurs been something I want to do.\" He added: \"I think that today has not just been a victory for me. It has been for a lot of other people, people who can't afford to come here and pay the costs to go through these things and fight against these newspapers.\" Sir Alan, asked what annoyed him about the article, said he did not like being called a miser. \"Newspapers destroy people's lives,\" he said. \"They take the mickey out of people just to increase their circulation. My victory today I hope will help to stop all that.\" Mr Powell told the court he considered that the \"miser of N17\" - as he called Sir Alan in his article - had under-invested in the team. \"I just felt George Graham deserved an injection of cash and if two terrific players were brought in there could have been a transformation and the story of Tottenham could have been different now,\" he explained. The newspaper's counsel, Victoria Sharp, told the court: \"It's very important to fly the flag of freedom of speech. You should be free to express your opinions about football - and so should Mr Powell.\" Press Association",

      "body": "<p>The British maker of one of the world's smallest military training aircraft is facing multi-million pound damages and legal costs after an American court ruled that one of its planes was defective and caused the death of a US Air Force cadet.</p> <p>Slingsby Aviation, which makes the Firefly trainer in a North Yorkshire village, was ordered to pay \u00a32.7m to the parents of 20-year-old Pace Weber, one of three young American trainees who have died with their trainers in accidents during two years' use of 113 Fireflies ordered by the USAF in 1993.</p> <p>A second damages hearing involving one of the other accidents is due in a fortnight in the same court in Miami, Florida, where a jury decided against the British firm this week. Slingsby may appeal the first decision, after arguing in court that Mr Weber's instructor, Captain Glen Comeaux, who also died, was tired and frustrated before the crash in June 1997.</p> <p>The jury decided that the T-3A Firefly, adapted for American military requirements, was \"defective and unreasonably dangerous at the time Slingsby sold it to the US Air Force.\"</p> <p>The argument hinged on claims of fuel supply problems and other safety issues, not unlike those which have long prevented another small British product, the Mini, from using American roads.</p> <p>Mr Weber's aircraft plummeted 800ft into the ground at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, allegedly after the failure of a fuel pump.</p> <p>The academy subsequently grounded all its Fireflies, a \u00a324m contract which had been the biggest and most prestigious order earned by the Slingsby factory in Kirkbymoorside.</p> <p>Plans for a \u00a34.3m modification of the plane were later abandoned and the whole fleet sent for scrap. Eleven other countries continue to use the fast and highly aerobatic plane, and the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and British army have used 43 Fireflies for almost a decade without serious mishaps.</p> <p>The Miami jury cut the \u00a35.5m damages claimed by Mr Weber's parents in half, but the family's attorney, Robert Park, said the principle had been won.

      "bodyText": "The British maker of one of the world's smallest military training aircraft is facing multi-million pound damages and legal costs after an American court ruled that one of its planes was defective and caused the death of a US Air Force cadet. Slingsby Aviation, which makes the Firefly trainer in a North Yorkshire village, was ordered to pay \u00a32.7m to the parents of 20-year-old Pace Weber, one of three young American trainees who have died with their trainers in accidents during two years' use of 113 Fireflies ordered by the USAF in 1993. A second damages hearing involving one of the other accidents is due in a fortnight in the same court in Miami, Florida, where a jury decided against the British firm this week. Slingsby may appeal the first decision, after arguing in court that Mr Weber's instructor, Captain Glen Comeaux, who also died, was tired and frustrated before the crash in June 1997. The jury decided that the T-3A Firefly, adapted for American military requirements, was \"defective and unreasonably dangerous at the time Slingsby sold it to the US Air Force.\" The argument hinged on claims of fuel supply problems and other safety issues, not unlike those which have long prevented another small British product, the Mini, from using American roads. Mr Weber's aircraft plummeted 800ft into the ground at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, allegedly after the failure of a fuel pump. The academy subsequently grounded all its Fireflies, a \u00a324m contract which had been the biggest and most prestigious order earned by the Slingsby factory in Kirkbymoorside. Plans for a \u00a34.3m modification of the plane were later abandoned and the whole fleet sent for scrap. Eleven other countries continue to use the fast and highly aerobatic plane, and the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and British army have used 43 Fireflies for almost a decade without serious mishaps. The Miami jury cut the \u00a35.5m damages claimed by Mr Weber's parents in half, but the family's attorney, Robert Park, said the principle had been won. He said after the verdict: \"We are ecstatic. We have proved that the plane was defective.\" A spokesman for Slinsgby, which is part of the Cobham defence engineering group, said: \"With the second case coming up, we have to regard this as sub judice, so I'm afraid we are being tight-lipped at the moment.\" Further damages and the failure of any appeal could have serious consequences for the 120 staff at Kirkbymoorside. Slingsby was forced to make 20 redundancies in August 1998 when the Ministry of Defence opted for the German Grob 115D instead of more Fireflies to replace its ageing fleet of Bulldog trainers.

Sales of mopeds and motorcycles are soaring with commuters and young \"fashionistas\" strapping on their helmets and donning leathers. Registration of mopeds is running 51% higher than 12 months ago with motorbikes up by 36% since the new year. Industry experts put the huge rise down to the crisis in transport - with railways struggling to return to regular timetables and traffic jams increasing travel times. People are simply looking for quicker and more reliable methods of going places. \"Despite a wet January, people are so fed up with the country's creaking public transport network and traffic congestion that they are turning to alternatives,\" said Kevin Kelly, the Retail Motor Industry Federation's director of motorcycle retailers.

The Nigerians, on average, are leaner, have lower cholesterol levels, and suffer less from high blood pressure and diabetes. \"Vascular disease may contribute both to dementia and to the development, progression, and clinical severity of Alzheimer's,\" the report said. Other studies have already hinted at a link between cardiovascular illness and Alzheimer's. However, there has never been enough evidence before to bracket Alzheimer's disease together with heart disease in public warnings about unhealthy eating.",

      "body": "<p>While I am greatly cheered by your exhortation to commit electoral hara-kiri (Leader, February 16), a few facts might help towards a balanced assessment. First, as the cynics in the Liberal and Tory opposition had already committed to no council tax increase, our budget referendum was the only opportunity available to secure support for an increase in the base budget for education. That has been rejected by a popular vote which is clearly representative of opinion in the city.</p> <p>Second, all four budget options we offered increased education spending in money terms. The two lower options did not fully cover the costs either of inflation, or of the additional education funding provided through the standard spending assessment, which we are expected to apply. Third, as we are already spending 12% above our education SSA (fourth highest in the country), education spending is the one and only reason for our relatively high council tax, and for our low spending on just about everything else.</p> <p>Finally, if you must quote Edmund Burke at us, then you really should finish the story in the way that Tony Benn used to do. After he had lectured the electors of Bristol about the importance of his judgment, they decided they had had quite enough of this arrogant sod and they gave him the boot. <br><b>Cllr George Micklewright </b><br>Leader, Bristol council<br><a href=\"mailto:george_micklewright@bristol-city.gov.uk\">george_micklewright@bristol-city.gov.uk</a></p> <p>As a teacher, I can understand why David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers berates Bristol council (Bristol faces big school cuts after tax referendum, February 15). But as a councillor, I would like to offer a second perspective. Local government is in crisis. It continues to be sidelined by a government that, for all its talk of reform, appears as centralist as its Conservative predecessors. It is not surprising that the public, less than 30% of whom vote in local elections, display little confidence in local authorities, whose powers are now minimal. A common complaint is that councils seldom consult and, if they do, they disregard what they hear.</p> <p>Bristol decided to consult its voters about the level of tax they wanted to pay. The implications of what they were deciding were explained to them.

      "bodyText": "While I am greatly cheered by your exhortation to commit electoral hara-kiri (Leader, February 16), a few facts might help towards a balanced assessment. First, as the cynics in the Liberal and Tory opposition had already committed to no council tax increase, our budget referendum was the only opportunity available to secure support for an increase in the base budget for education. That has been rejected by a popular vote which is clearly representative of opinion in the city. Second, all four budget options we offered increased education spending in money terms. The two lower options did not fully cover the costs either of inflation, or of the additional education funding provided through the standard spending assessment, which we are expected to apply. Third, as we are already spending 12% above our education SSA (fourth highest in the country), education spending is the one and only reason for our relatively high council tax, and for our low spending on just about everything else. Finally, if you must quote Edmund Burke at us, then you really should finish the story in the way that Tony Benn used to do. After he had lectured the electors of Bristol about the importance of his judgment, they decided they had had quite enough of this arrogant sod and they gave him the boot. Cllr George Micklewright Leader, Bristol council george_micklewright@bristol-city.gov.uk As a teacher, I can understand why David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers berates Bristol council (Bristol faces big school cuts after tax referendum, February 15). But as a councillor, I would like to offer a second perspective. Local government is in crisis. It continues to be sidelined by a government that, for all its talk of reform, appears as centralist as its Conservative predecessors. It is not surprising that the public, less than 30% of whom vote in local elections, display little confidence in local authorities, whose powers are now minimal. A common complaint is that councils seldom consult and, if they do, they disregard what they hear. Bristol decided to consult its voters about the level of tax they wanted to pay. The implications of what they were deciding were explained to them. David Hart says that, in doing this, the council was abdicating its responsibilities and that the councillors were being \"reckless beyond belief\". I would argue they were trying to engage people in decisions about their lives and the future of their city. No one emerges with credit. The real fault, however, lies not with the council but with a government more concerned with pre-election tax cuts than with providing the money and resources that schools so desperately need. Cllr Jim Campbell Chair, Liberal Democrat group Oxford council jimc@frenchayox.demon.co.uk The Bristol Labour group is grossly irresponsible. I voted for them to lead and not abdicate responsibility for the most challenging decision of the year, namely setting the budget. What are we in for next? Referendums on planning consents, community care budgets and the number of health inspectors? They have lost my vote and I suspect a numbers of others. David Cemlyn Bristol scbr21201@cableinet.co.uk You report that the electors of Bristol \"unexpectedly\" rejected any council tax increase for next year.

However, when British Telecom triumphantly told me that, in answer to my fevered plaint as to when the new business and modem lines in my new home would be connected, it had just put them in, I said, 'Oh,really? But I've been waiting all afternoon for the engineer to arrive.' When it slowly dawned on me that the lines had indeed been installed, but in the house I had just left, rather than the house I had just moved into, I opened a bottle of Isla Negra Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 and got stuck in.</p> <p>So, it has to be said, did BT - but only after I had bypassed the robots who answer the enquiry lines and angrily tackled the corporation's PR department. This column, then, owes everything to Peter, the Aston Villa-supporting BT engineer who gave up his Saturday in order to permit this column to be electronically transmitted direct from my own desk. Hallelujah!</p> <p>The Isla Negra was, and is, delicious, but even at 16.5 points (out of 20) and on offer at \u00a34.49 at Waitrose until March 4, it was only moderate solace for the impotent fury that sweeps over the subscriber when faced with an incompetent (Peter excepted) monopoly. The savoury tannins of the wine moderate the effect of the fruit's rich juiciness. This wine has appeared in this column before, but not at a wholly reasonable \u00a34.49.</p> <p>While wandering the Waitrose aisles, you might care to know about a few other bottles that this charming retailer has in stock. Willow Ridge Sauvignon/Feteasca 1999 (14.5 points, \u00a32.99 until March 4), from Romania, is fresh and crisp, gooseberry concentrated and cheerful, and makes a delightful aperitif. Vina Fuerte Garnacha 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.49 until March 4), from Spain, is cultured, soft and yieldingly textured, gorgeously ripe yet not manic. This is a versatile red wine, presenting an abundance of food-matching opportunities (from cod to cow, spicy vegetables to grilled calamari). Mezzomondo Negroamaro 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99, or buy two bottles and have a quid knocked off the aggregated price), with its rich, herby fruit, spicy tan nins and first-class texture and concentration of flavours, is also a red wine for food.</p> <p>At Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, there is Kumala Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 2000 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from the Cape, a wine that has a lovely, meaty edge and tannins to mitigate the hugeness of the juice. This is one of my favourite wines to keep around for visits to friendly ethnic BYO restaurants - keeping a few bottles handy for this purpose avoids having to chance your arm at an off-licence where the prices are highish and the fruit iffy.</p> <p>Six interesting wines at Asda now, all of them from the dynamic new world. Kumala Chenin Chardonnay 2000 (15 points, \u00a33.99) is biting, clean and typical without being predictable (it has a subtle, exotic undertone). Also from South Africa comes Speir Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a34.49), with its toothsome, nutty and ripely gooseberry fruitiness; and Speir Chenin Blanc 2000 (15 points, \u00a34.99), which features apricot, melon and lemon, yet is crisp as much as it is creamy. From Argentina, there is Far Flung Viognier 2000 (16.5 points, \u00a34.97), which offers beautiful dry, apricot fruit with a touch of cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e on the finish, or is it gun smoke? Well, it's a delicate beauty for all that, and would make a hugely elegant and striking aperitif. The Argentine Sangiovese 2000 (16 points, \u00a33.99) has show-stopping fruit of rhythm and richness, perfect for spicy food (and mood), but you need to move fast if you are to nab this bargain, as Asda is discontinuing it, so it'll be available only while current stocks last.</p> <p>Last, and exclusive to Asda, there is Mighty Murray Chardonnay 2000 (16 points, \u00a34.48), which is ripe but not over-eager. It has a gorgeous, spicy, apricot and melon fruitiness to it that brings a glow to the cheeks. It is not a posh or a classic chardonnay; it is just delicious glugging at a bargain price.</p> <p>\u0095 For the latest wine news, and to email Malcolm Gluck, visit <a href=\"http://www.superplonk.com\" target=\"_new\">Superplonk.com</a>.</p>",

The Isla Negra was, and is, delicious, but even at 16.5 points (out of 20) and on offer at \u00a34.49 at Waitrose until March 4, it was only moderate solace for the impotent fury that sweeps over the subscriber when faced with an incompetent (Peter excepted) monopoly. The savoury tannins of the wine moderate the effect of the fruit's rich juiciness. This wine has appeared in this column before, but not at a wholly reasonable \u00a34.49. While wandering the Waitrose aisles, you might care to know about a few other bottles that this charming retailer has in stock. Willow Ridge Sauvignon/Feteasca 1999 (14.5 points, \u00a32.99 until March 4), from Romania, is fresh and crisp, gooseberry concentrated and cheerful, and makes a delightful aperitif. Vina Fuerte Garnacha 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.49 until March 4), from Spain, is cultured, soft and yieldingly textured, gorgeously ripe yet not manic. This is a versatile red wine, presenting an abundance of food-matching opportunities (from cod to cow, spicy vegetables to grilled calamari). Mezzomondo Negroamaro 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99, or buy two bottles and have a quid knocked off the aggregated price), with its rich, herby fruit, spicy tan nins and first-class texture and concentration of flavours, is also a red wine for food. At Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, there is Kumala Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 2000 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from the Cape, a wine that has a lovely, meaty edge and tannins to mitigate the hugeness of the juice. This is one of my favourite wines to keep around for visits to friendly ethnic BYO restaurants - keeping a few bottles handy for this purpose avoids having to chance your arm at an off-licence where the prices are highish and the fruit iffy. Six interesting wines at Asda now, all of them from the dynamic new world. Kumala Chenin Chardonnay 2000 (15 points, \u00a33.99) is biting, clean and typical without being predictable (it has a subtle, exotic undertone). Also from South Africa comes Speir Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a34.49), with its toothsome, nutty and ripely gooseberry fruitiness; and Speir Chenin Blanc 2000 (15 points, \u00a34.99), which features apricot, melon and lemon, yet is crisp as much as it is creamy. From Argentina, there is Far Flung Viognier 2000 (16.5 points, \u00a34.97), which offers beautiful dry, apricot fruit with a touch of cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e on the finish, or is it gun smoke? Well, it's a delicate beauty for all that, and would make a hugely elegant and striking aperitif. The Argentine Sangiovese 2000 (16 points, \u00a33.99) has show-stopping fruit of rhythm and richness, perfect for spicy food (and mood), but you need to move fast if you are to nab this bargain, as Asda is discontinuing it, so it'll be available only while current stocks last. Last, and exclusive to Asda, there is Mighty Murray Chardonnay 2000 (16 points, \u00a34.48), which is ripe but not over-eager. It has a gorgeous, spicy, apricot and melon fruitiness to it that brings a glow to the cheeks. It is not a posh or a classic chardonnay; it is just delicious glugging at a bargain price. \u0095 For the latest wine news, and to email Malcolm Gluck, visit Superplonk.com.",

Not only is this the first major exhibition of his work in the UK, but just a glance at the photographs and films on show will reveal how contemporary his buildings and landscapes actually were. The monkish Barragan would have hated the idea, but this major retrospective is set to transform him from a well-regarded, if obscure, architect to that of millennial trendsetter. </p> <p>Key to much of Barragan's work is his bold use of colour - the hues of traditional Mexico in an otherwise modernist setting. In the brilliant blend of coloured walls and reflected water in the indoor swimming pool of Casa Gilardi (1975-77), say, or the right-angled pink walls on the roof terrace of his home at Calle Ramirez 14, Barragan anticipated the current fashion for \"warm minimalism\" years before the term was coined. </p> <p>When he died in 1988, so-called minimalist design was poised to define the following decade. During the 90s, you just weren't with it unless you not only chucked out the chintz, but all excess ornamentation as well.

At best, they photographed beautifully, were easy to dust and had a calming, Zen-like quality. At worst, however, they were as inviting as a dental surgery, not so much neutral as neurotic. What if you had children who were likely to smear their greasy paws on your pristine white walls? And who, exactly, was going to keep those places clean? Minimalism, at its most fanatical, might have looked good in books, but in reality it just wouldn't wash. </p> <p>Now, with the start of a new century, minimalism has come in from the cold, its uncompromising cool given more humanity. Ornamentation is no longer taboo - provided, of course, that it is well-chosen and does not descend into clutter - while books and articles champion the idea of \"practical minimalism\". What's wrong with an outrageous, warming pink on one wall of the sitting room, set off nicely with a terracotta floor and three other neutral-coloured walls? </p> <p>Barragan paved the way for this. Travelling as a young man in Europe in 1924-25, he was taken with the avant-garde ideas of the modern movement - multi-functional living areas, cubic shapes, free from history - but also the centuries-old palace and gardens of the Alhambra in Spain. When he came to design some of his most interesting work, from the 40s onwards, he would step back from the uncompromising, rationalist ideology of the moderns - he thought their obsession with large areas of glass \"an act of impudence to the human needs for privacy and intimacy\", and preferred the enclosure of walls. Architecture, he said, was \"emotional\", \"not a cold piece of convenience\". </p> <p>His frustration with architecture led him, in 1940, to renounce buildings and concentrate on gardens instead. By 1945, he had bought 400 hectares of land on the outskirts of Mexico City and began the El Pedregal development of housing and gardens, remarkable in that the design was dictated by, and built around, the shapes of cooled lava flows. </p> <p>Barragan thought buildings should be conceived with nature in mind - the garden was architecture without a roof. In the stables area of the Egerstrom home he built on the outskirts of Mexico City in 1967-68, he enclosed a vast geometric pool, used by the horses, with walls of different heights in bright pink and vermillion - the walls are designed to offer different perspectives on the courtyard, like giant pieces of abstract art. </p> <p>He preferred the sensible over the intellectual, cherry-picking the best modern ideas in art and architecture, then applying them to his particular world view. The \"floating\" staircase he built at Calle Ramirez 14, where a series of steps along one wall seems suspended on the air, shows his interest in surrealism. And in the dining room of the same house, a large window looks on to an enclosed courtyard, so one can contemplate the beauty of the outdoors from the privacy of your home. </p> <p>Barragan's background among the ranches, convents and villages of Jalisco province informed all his work. He loved horses, and the most famous images of the Egerstrom home are the stable and exercise areas. He often placed windows above head height, allowing only a view of the sky and emphasising the life of contemplation and spirituality of religious orders. But it is for the colours of ordinary Mexican villages that he will best be remembered: \"Colours express the state of mind and humour of the inhabitants. If a house changes its colour it changes its overall atmosphere and spirit. If you observe the portals full of colour and shadows, they are also full of emotions, they are an architecture of the senses and the sentiments...\" </p> <p>And of great beauty, too </p> <p> \u0095 Luis Barragan: The Quiet Revolution, is at the Design Museum, London SE1, from March 9-July 8, 020-7403 6933.

      "body": "<p>Last month, you may remember, it was with some trepidation that I picked up the gauntlet of coming up with a dinner menu consisting of dishes that required only six ingredients (other than such store cupboard staples as onions, spuds, oils, butter, seasonings and the like). So, when the boss last week started gabbing about a book - Rozanne Gold's Recipes 123 - in which all the recipes use only three, I began to feel that my very soul was in peril.</p> <p>Now that I come to think of it however, there are actually a great many delightful dishes that use only the bare minimum of ingredients and preparation: oysters, say, or the once noble smoked salmon (now usurped in the restaurant world by smoked eel and mackerel), leaf salad, calves' liver, steak, cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e, apple pie, or even potted shrimps...</p> <p>Some might say that all these dishes have been diminished by overexposure and dreadful cheap imitation, but they don't have to be. There is still great merit in using a limited number of ingredients (though three may be taking things just that little bit too far), provided that one essential rule is obeyed: that the ingredients used are very good and, for the most part, in the prime of their season.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Potato, leek and mussel soup</b></p> <p>Not dissimilar to cock-a-leekie, with mussels taking the place of prunes and rice. The wine and mussel liquor add a depth of flavour to a soup already characterised by a clear, pure taste. The stock must be made from good chicken: I have tried it with the hellish nugget that is the stock cube, but the result negates the effort of preparing good ingredients, let alone buying them. That means it will take a little time to cook, but it doesn't require constant attention. Nor does the chicken go to waste: cut it up and add to the soup, or use in a salad dressed in mayonnaise flavoured with tarragon.</p> <p><b>2-2.5kg mussels</b> <br> <b>2 large waxy potatoes</b> <br> <b>2kg leeks</b> <br> <b>1 free-range organic chicken </b> <br> <b>2 bayleaves</b> <br> <b>1 small sprig thyme, tied </b> <br> <b>1 bunch spring onions </b> <br> <b>150ml white wine </b> <br> <b>Sea salt and fresh black pepper </b> <br> <b>1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped</b></p> <p>Scrape and beard the mussels, then rinse them under cold, running water for half an hour. Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes, the neatness of which is irrelevant. Trim the leaks and discard any blemishes. Remove the greater part of the green, wash this thoroughly, then tie into bundles. Cut the white into small squares, and rinse thoroughly. Finely chop the spring onions.</p> <p>Place the chicken, bayleaves, green leek bundles and thyme in a big, heavy-based pot, and pour in enough water just to cover. Bring up to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface, then add the cubed potatoes and leave to cook for another 40 minutes or so, skimming occasionally.</p> <p>Add the chopped leeks, and simmer for 15 minutes or so. Stir in the sliced spring onion and season. Remove the tied leeks and the chicken carcass, take the meat off the bone and place to one side. Warm another big pot and throw in the mussels and wine. Cover, and shake gently until all the mussels have opened.</p> <p>Gently spoon the mussels into the soup. Strain the mussel liquor through a fine sieve into the soup (you might be best off not pouring the last tablespoon or so through the sieve, as it will be very gritty indeed). Stir in the chicken meat, if using, and garnish with the parsley.</p> <p><b> Rabbit with mustard sauce</b></p> <p>A great dish with many variations and degrees of heat - braised, the mustard becomes very mild (all mustards lose their wrath when exposed to heat), which is why I prefer it cooked gently in a frying pan. The resulting sauce is light and fresh, with a gently challenging heat. Whatever method you use, there is one rule: use reputable Dijon mustard only. The French have a great understanding of wine vinegars and mustard, and although the British love them, too, the quality of our produce is, with a few exceptions, usually and incomprehensively very poor. The addition of fresh tarragon is very good in this dish (added to the mustard sauce). Yes, I know that, when included, this brings the number of non-store cupboard ingredients to more than six. But most of those ingredients would probably be to hand in a well-stocked kitchen - and, anyway, I always seem to be in trouble for breaking rules, so I may as well carry on the tradition.</p> <p><b> 1-2 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b> 6 rabbit legs, on the bone </b><br> <b> 570ml white wine </b><br> <b> 1 small sprig thyme </b><br> <b> 1 clove garlic, crushed </b><br> <b> 3 tsp Dijon mustard </b><br> <b> 4-6 tbsp whipping cream </b><br> <b> 50ml chicken stock </b><br> <b> lemon, juiced </b><br> <b> Sea salt and fresh black pepper</b></p> <p>Heat a heavy-based frying pan and pour in a thin film of oil. Lightly salt the rabbit legs, lay them in the oil, turn down the heat and slow-fry. Do not disturb the meat in any way, as you want it to develop a beautiful, golden crust. After 15-20 minutes, turn over the legs and cook undisturbed for another five to 10 minutes. Raise the heat, pour in the wine and, when it has reduced to a syrup, add the thyme, garlic and pepper. Remove the pan from the heat and let sit for a further 10 minutes.</p> <p>Remove the rabbit and transfer to a warm dish. Whisk the cream and mustard together until smooth. Add the stock to the pan, bring to a boil, scraping up any residue on the bottom. Pour the gravy through a fine-mesh sieve on to the mustard/cream mixture, stir until all is incorporated into a smooth sauce, then tip into a small pot. Add the lemon juice and, if the sauce seems too thick, a little cold water. Place the rabbit on a serving plate and pour over the sauce.</p> <p><b> Fried cabbages</b></p> <p>A beloved vegetable that requires but a little thought and even less cooking to make a lovely accompaniment to a dish, such as the rabbit above.</p> <p><b> 1 hispi cabbage </b><br> <b>Savoy cabbage </b><br> <b>1 handful curly kale </b><br> <b>4 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>1 tbsp very good white-wine vinegar </b><br> <b>1 small sprig thyme </b><br> <b>2 juniper berries </b><br> <b>Sea salt and fresh black pepper </b><br> <b>70g unsalted butter</b></p> <p>Shred the cabbages, discarding any blemished leaves and roots as you go, then leave to sit in cold water for 10 minutes. Tip the cabbage into a colander and leave to drain, shaking occasionally. Heat a large pot, add the olive oil and butter, then pop in the cabbage and a little salt. Crush the juniper berries, and add these to the pot, along with plenty of pepper and the thyme. Stir the cabbage a few times, then add the vinegar. Leave to cook for eight to 10 minutes.</p> <p><b> Blood orange and Campari granita</b></p> <p>When I first tasted Campari as a teen-ager on holiday in France, I affected a sophisticated manner, dismissed G&amp;T as vulgar, and was an all-round trial for my parents. As my two brothers had already been through this snotty phase, they'd seen and heard it all before, so I had to get very inventive to get noticed - becoming an aesthete seemed perfectly sensible. Drinks and cigarettes, I reasoned, had to be tr\u00e8s chic. The only good to come from that mercifully brief time was my continued fondness for Campari.</p> <p>On arriving in Italy last summer to teach at the Tasting Places cookery school in Umbria, I found a half-empty litre bottle of Campari in the bar that had not been opened for quite some time. Needless to say, after one week of hard work and ruthless drilling of the students, I was gravely informed that the number of bottles of Campari consumed had reached double figures (not just by me, I hasten to add). Quite right too, said I, it is a great drink - and it also makes a splendid granita. I am indebted to Maxine at Tasting Places for this recipe. The blood oranges this winter have been very tart and very small, so use good oranges or even pink grapefruits instead if they prove unsatisfactory.</p> <p><b> 16-24 blood oranges (enough to render 500ml juice) </b><br> <b>135g granulated sugar </b><br> <b>70ml Campari</b></p> <p>Grate the oranges on the finest mesh, taking care not to scrape off any pith. Halve the fruits, extract the juice and strain through a stainless-steel sieve. Put the sugar and the zest into a food processor and blend until the sugar turns orange, damp and mushy. Mix the sugar with the Campari and orange juice. Pour into a suitable tray and pop into the freezer. Every 20 minutes or so, run the tines of a fork through the freezing mush until the tray contains a glittering heap of crystals. Transfer the granita to a chilled, sealable container.</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here's something to think on, next time you find yourself desperate to lose consciousness before the first of the early birds bursts into song. As you give your pillow one final punch, consider the ways in which sleep resembles the ocean. </p> <p>Much as the ocean envelops the planet, so sleep enshrouds one third of a human life. Each has its tides and its cycles, its risings and fallings, and each may be tranquil and serene at one moment, stormy and filled with sudden, hidden horrors the next. For both sleep and the ocean have their shallows and shelves that fall without warning into sunless trenches. But perhaps the most remarkable shared quality is that of mystery. For while both sleep and the ocean are familiar - they could hardly be otherwise, given that they surround all our lives - each remains a strange and secret place, whose deepest depths remain largely unfathomed. </p> <p>Sleep is one of those things we all do, like being born and dying, like eating, breathing. Most of us do it at night, for between six and nine hours at a stretch (seven-and-a-half hours is the adult average). But newborn babies may sleep on and off for as much as 16 hours a day: in old age humans revert to that pattern of frequent napping, while sleeping in total about as much as they did in middle age. </p> <p>Because it is a shared experience, our language and culture are heavy with sleep. We say that the celibate sleep alone, that the successful live in houses with many bedrooms and that we can be whoever we want to be in our dreams. Yet for something that is so inextricably woven into life, sleep bears an uncanny resemblance to death. </p> <p>In Islam, sleep is frequently referred to as \"the little death\", and Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep, was the son of Nyx (night) andbrother of Thanatos (death). Literature makes much of the apparent similarity between the sleeping and the dead, and the language and other paraphernalia of sleep have long been used to soften the finality of the grave. </p> <p>If the sleeper lies midway between life and death, then those literary characters known as \"long time sleepers\" - people such as the Sleeping Beauty and Rip Van Winkle - lie somewhere between death and sleeping. For nearly a thousand years, the west took comfort from the story of seven Christian lads who fled Ephesus during the Diocletian persecution, hid in a cave and found themselves walled up. Rather than die, the Seven Sleepers, as they were later known, simply dropped off. Two centuries later, they woke up and went in search of provisions, before announcing that they were going back to sleep again and were not to be disturbed until the Judgment Day. </p> <p>Of course, what such tales describe is suspended animation, hibernation and coma. And sleep isn't the same as these, any more than it is the same as death. But if we can say what sleep isn't, can we say what it is? </p> <p> 'So convincing were those dreams of being awake that he awoke from them each morning in complete exhaustion and fell right back to sleep.' <strong> Joseph Heller, Catch-22</strong> </p> <p> There you are, in front of the television. It's late, the room is warm, the sofa is comfortable, you are pleasantly full and pleasantly tired. Then, out of the blue, someone calls you to account. \"You were asleep just then,\" they say accusingly. But you were not asleep. \"Yes you were. You had your eyes closed and you were snoring.\" Snoring? You never snore. And, anyway, you were absolutely not asleep. Were you? </p> <p>If you were asleep, you wouldn't necessarily know about it, since you could well have been dreaming that you were watching television. In sleep laboratories, subjects are so prone to arguing about whether they were asleep at any given time that researchers have invented a special category of unconsciousness called \"self-described sleep\". Clearly, what's needed is a set of objective criteria. </p> <p>Sleep is generally defined as a regularly recurring suspension of consciousness that differs from coma and hibernation in being easily reversible and more or less spontaneous (ie, you can switch out the light and put out the cat, but you can't make yourself lose consciousness without using drugs). The purpose of the exercise, or rather the lack of it, is presumed to be rest and recuperation. </p> <p>But although there are behavioural indications that a person is asleep, these can be misleading. For example, humans, in common with many animals, usually do it lying down, but TV viewers and opera-goers - even motorway drivers, unfortunately - frequently settle for a chair. We generally close our eyes, but people can sleep with them open (they just don't see anything through them). Then there are the skeletal muscles - the ones that control limbs and so on. These are usually relaxed during sleep, but somnambulists break this rule every time they climb out of bed and head downstairs. And they walk all over another important telltale sign of sleep, too - the supposed absence of goal-directed behaviour. </p> <p>The advent of the electroencephalograph (EEG) in 1929 tightened our definition of sleep. This machine can detect electrical brain activity and translate it into squiggly lines on a sheet of paper. During sleep, it was found that these traces show distinctive patterns. Armed with these techniques, plus some increasingly sophisticated kit that detects neural activity, sleep theorists are now able to conduct convoluted arguments with each other about what sleep is and how it might work. Some believe it to be a passive thing - a state we fall into, characterised by a lack of activity. Others maintain that it is an active process - that sleep is initiated and maintained, possibly by one or more \"sleep centres\" in the brain. </p> <p>A major change in the way we think about our regular spells of unconsciousness came with the discovery that sleep has more than one form. Once upon a time, when people believed in beautiful princesses and young men thought nothing of hibernating in caves, sleep was regarded as a unitary state. We might do it well or badly, deeply or lightly, but on the whole, if we weren't awake, we were asleep. Then, in 1953, the physiologists Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman spotted something that suggested there was more to a good night's sleep than simply eight hours of shut-eye. </p> <p> 'Sleep is when all the unsorted stuff comes out as from a dustbin upset in a high wind.' <strong> William Golding, Pincher Martin</strong> </p> <p> What Aserinsky and Kleitman noticed in their lab was that, after about an hour's sleep, people's eyes started moving rapidly under their eyelids. At the same time, their EEG traces began to resemble those of subjects who were awake and alert. If the subject was woken up at this stage, they reported dreams - usually vivid, visual dreams - 20 times out of 27, compared with only four times out of 23 when their eyes and brains were less active. Now, the world of sleep research - indeed, the world at large - had an exciting and baffling new concept to play with. It was called Rapid Eye Movement sleep, or REM sleep for short. And with it, by extension, came a less glamorous phenomenon known as NREM sleep, the initial \"N\" simply standing for \"non\". </p> <p>The unitary state of sleep was now split in two; and it soon became apparent from the EEG traces that NREM sleep could itself be divided into four stages. Researchers now tell us that a typical night's sleep for an adult human will begin with a period of shallow, stage-1 sleep, during which body temperature will begin to drop (it reaches its lowest point after five or six hours). This is quickly followed by deeper, stage-2 sleep, during which an EEG will trace wave sequences known as \"sleep spindles\". Deeper sleep comes with stage 3, and here there are high-voltage EEG tracings with an increasing predominance of so-called delta-wave activity. Gradually, the body falls into the very deepest form of sleep, known as stage-4 sleep, and now the brain reverberates with those big, slow delta waves. </p> <p>After the depths of stage 4, sleep eases back to stage 3, followed by a second period of stage 2. Then, after 70 to 90 minutes of this NREM sleep, there comes a first, brief bout of REM sleep (unlike newborn infants, adults rarely go straight into REM sleep). This first session lasts for only five to 15 minutes before the cycle begins again. But as the cycles repeat, the periods of stage-3 and stage-4 sleep shrink, and the REM sleep sessions get longer. By morning, REM sleep will have accounted for a quarter of the time spent sleeping, most of the remainder being stage-2 sleep. </p> <p>REM sleep is also known as \"paradoxical sleep\", because a subject in REM sleep often resembles someone who is wide awake. EEG patterns in the deeper stages of NREM sleep (also called \"orthodox\" sleep) are those associated with decreased vigilance during wakefulness, and in many ways NREM sleep, particularly in the deeper stages, resembles the sort of restful state - slow breathing, reduced heart rate and blood pressure - that body and brain might need to recuperate. </p> <p>By contrast, brain wave activity, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure all rise again during REM sleep, and can fluctuate rapidly. As well as those rapid eye movements, there are fast, small and irregular brain waves, and various other indications of arousal. Yet at the same time muscle tone reduces so drastically as to amount to temporary paralysis, almost as if our bodies were trying to prevent us from acting out our dreams. </p> <p>And what a temptation that is. For while most of the dreams recalled by subjects roused during NREM sleep are said to be thoughtlike and realistic, resembling the experiences of wakefulness, REM dreams are something else entirely. </p> <p> 'Sleep hath its own world, And a wide realm of wild reality, And dreams in their development have breath, And tears, and tortures, and the touch of Joy.' <strong> Byron, The Dream</strong> </p> <p> You are driving along the motorway, intent on delivering a lightbulb to someone you met briefly on a boat. But why are you going to all this trouble? The intended recipient of this strange gift is now naked and beckoning you from the back seat. Pulling back on the steering wheel (careful it doesn't come off in your hands again), you manage to put the car into a steep climb before squeezing yourself between the front seats (how annoying that they seem to be covered with orange prickles) and joining your passenger. But not so fast. The manoeuvre has upset the balance of the vehicle and you are falling, falling... Just then, you remember that you can, in fact, fly - that you always could fly, until, that is, your sister started working every weekday afternoon for a charity shop in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>It's all good knockabout fun, this dreaming caper, and the indications are that it's enjoyed by monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, shrews, opossums and even some reptiles and birds (recent research suggests that songbirds practise singing in their sleep). But humans have never been able to leave it at that. Right from the word go, we have assumed - not unreasonably, perhaps - that these super-real experiences must mean something.

In a book called The Interpretation Of Dreams, he argued that the events that occur in a dream (the manifest content) are the disguised expression of unconscious desires (the latent content) that are kept out of the conscious mind (repressed) on account of their unacceptable nature (ie, they frequently concern sex or hostility). But although such forbidden impulses can be expressed during sleep, they must still be coded in such a way that the dreamer does not recognise them upon waking. </p> <p>By a process that Freud called \"dreamwork\", he believed that these impulses were transformed into symbolic images that derived from such diverse stimuli as pressure in the bladder, experiences from the previous day (day residues) and infantile memories. Like the priests of ancient Greece, a therapist might translate these symbols back into their original form during psychoanalysis in order to understand what is really going on in the patient's head. Dreams, Freud maintained, were therefore nothing less than \"the royal road to the unconscious\". </p> <p>Carl Jung famously disagreed with all this, arguing instead that dreams balanced whatever elements of the dreamer's character are under-represented in the way they live their lives. Dreams, he reckoned, represented the surfacing during sleep of what was actually a continuous 24-hour flow of mental activity. Their purpose is not to conceal or disguise forbidden wishes, but rather to bring the neglected areas of character to attention. This was a self-regulating mechanism in the normal, healthy individual, and only if the subject became distressed and moody during the day was there any need to take dreams to bits. </p> <p>Other theorists have since suggested that dreams do not have the significance that Freud or anybody else has attributed to them. Rather, they are simply the random welling up during sleep of memories and images. Was the new science barking up the wrong tree entirely? Freud's ideas inspired some fantastic art and some really spooky movies. But recent experience has shown that depressed patients can actually make better progress if they are given drugs that deprive them of dreams altogether. \"If people are miserable when they go to sleep, they are likely to have miserable dreams,\" explains one researcher. \"And because the memory of those dreams will make them all the more miserable the next morning, they probably find it a relief not to dream at all.\" So much for the royal road to the unconscious. </p> <p> 'The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.' <br> <strong> Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream</strong> </p> <p> An obvious problem for anyone engaged in the study of dreams is that only the dreamer knows what went on in the dream. And the problem is then compounded by the fact that much of this is forgotten on waking. Then there's the influence of the conscious mind to take into account.

But if it's simply the way things have been of late, there are any number of useful tips out there. The most common advice is to get into a routine. Going to bed and getting up at the same time help the body establish a pattern (bodies like patterns); and keeping a record of your routine and noting down what it is that wakes you up, and when, might further help the list-makers among us.

Make a list of the problems you can deal with, decide how you are going to deal with them, then put them out of your mind. A heavy meal might make you sleepy, but digesting it could keep you awake.

Concentrate intensely on relaxing all your muscle groups, starting with your scalp (that should keep you busy for a while) and working down to your toes.

Another is to recall in detail a house where you lived as a child (in the event of an unhappy childhood, a change of premises is advised). Is there a sofa in the living room? Okay. So fill the sofa with old friends, with famous inventors or movie stars of your choice. Then start talking to them.

Just pick a word from the alphabetical list of key words and press that button. <a href=\"http://diverseworld.com/fate/dreams/dream1.html\" target=\"_new\"> Dream Dictionary</a> describes itself as 'the new presentation of an ancient wisdom', and there you'll find all the old favourites. But tread carefully - the meaning of, say, water in a dream 'depends on the details and the action, but as a general guide, clear calm water is a favourable omen, while rough or murky water signifies difficulties'. </p> <p>Hot water 'portends a season of social and/or business setbacks', while running water predicts 'lasting happiness'. You could, in fact, work out most of these symbols for yourself. A dog represents fidelity and friendship, but a vicious dog denotes aggression. Dolphins denote intelligence, oak trees symbolise strength, rocks represent obstacles, and pendulums presage a change of plan.</p> <p> Here are some of the most common dream elements:<br> <strong> Teeth:</strong> If your teeth fall out in your dreams, it may be that you fear powerlessness, or sexual impotence. You need to assert yourself more, and have a higher regard for your own opinion. </p> <p><strong> Exams:</strong> If you find yourself sitting an exam in your dreams, but you don't understand the question, it's likely that you are being somehow judged or tested in your waking life. Your anxiety and frustration in the dream suggest your feelings of inadequacy. </p> <p> <strong> Being chased:</strong> Again, the general anxieties in your life are being transferred to a dream. Your pursuer may well represent a part of yourself, or your own feelings of fear, jealousy or anger, which turn on you in your dream and threaten to harm you. </p> <p><strong> Flying:</strong> Often, the experience of flying in a dream is exhilarating. Flying with ease suggests that you are on top of things, while having difficulties staying aloft implies that you are struggling to control your life. </p> <p><strong> Falling:</strong> Instability, insecurity, anxiety, inferiority - all the usual suspects contribute to the dream sensation of falling, which is common in the early stages of sleep and is frequently accompanied by twitches and jerks. Freud reckoned that such dreams indicate that you are about to give in to a sexual urge. </p> <p> <strong> Nudity:</strong> Dreaming that you are naked in public may indicate that you have something to hide, that you have made a mistake or are ashamed and insecure. If your nudity goes unnoticed, it may be that your fears are unfounded. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Here's something to think on, next time you find yourself desperate to lose consciousness before the first of the early birds bursts into song. As you give your pillow one final punch, consider the ways in which sleep resembles the ocean. Much as the ocean envelops the planet, so sleep enshrouds one third of a human life. Each has its tides and its cycles, its risings and fallings, and each may be tranquil and serene at one moment, stormy and filled with sudden, hidden horrors the next. For both sleep and the ocean have their shallows and shelves that fall without warning into sunless trenches. But perhaps the most remarkable shared quality is that of mystery. For while both sleep and the ocean are familiar - they could hardly be otherwise, given that they surround all our lives - each remains a strange and secret place, whose deepest depths remain largely unfathomed. Sleep is one of those things we all do, like being born and dying, like eating, breathing. Most of us do it at night, for between six and nine hours at a stretch (seven-and-a-half hours is the adult average). But newborn babies may sleep on and off for as much as 16 hours a day: in old age humans revert to that pattern of frequent napping, while sleeping in total about as much as they did in middle age. Because it is a shared experience, our language and culture are heavy with sleep. We say that the celibate sleep alone, that the successful live in houses with many bedrooms and that we can be whoever we want to be in our dreams. Yet for something that is so inextricably woven into life, sleep bears an uncanny resemblance to death. In Islam, sleep is frequently referred to as \"the little death\", and Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep, was the son of Nyx (night) andbrother of Thanatos (death). Literature makes much of the apparent similarity between the sleeping and the dead, and the language and other paraphernalia of sleep have long been used to soften the finality of the grave. If the sleeper lies midway between life and death, then those literary characters known as \"long time sleepers\" - people such as the Sleeping Beauty and Rip Van Winkle - lie somewhere between death and sleeping. For nearly a thousand years, the west took comfort from the story of seven Christian lads who fled Ephesus during the Diocletian persecution, hid in a cave and found themselves walled up. Rather than die, the Seven Sleepers, as they were later known, simply dropped off. Two centuries later, they woke up and went in search of provisions, before announcing that they were going back to sleep again and were not to be disturbed until the Judgment Day. Of course, what such tales describe is suspended animation, hibernation and coma. And sleep isn't the same as these, any more than it is the same as death. But if we can say what sleep isn't, can we say what it is? 'So convincing were those dreams of being awake that he awoke from them each morning in complete exhaustion and fell right back to sleep.' Joseph Heller, Catch-22 There you are, in front of the television. It's late, the room is warm, the sofa is comfortable, you are pleasantly full and pleasantly tired. Then, out of the blue, someone calls you to account. \"You were asleep just then,\" they say accusingly. But you were not asleep. \"Yes you were. You had your eyes closed and you were snoring.\" Snoring? You never snore. And, anyway, you were absolutely not asleep. Were you? If you were asleep, you wouldn't necessarily know about it, since you could well have been dreaming that you were watching television. In sleep laboratories, subjects are so prone to arguing about whether they were asleep at any given time that researchers have invented a special category of unconsciousness called \"self-described sleep\". Clearly, what's needed is a set of objective criteria. Sleep is generally defined as a regularly recurring suspension of consciousness that differs from coma and hibernation in being easily reversible and more or less spontaneous (ie, you can switch out the light and put out the cat, but you can't make yourself lose consciousness without using drugs). The purpose of the exercise, or rather the lack of it, is presumed to be rest and recuperation. But although there are behavioural indications that a person is asleep, these can be misleading. For example, humans, in common with many animals, usually do it lying down, but TV viewers and opera-goers - even motorway drivers, unfortunately - frequently settle for a chair. We generally close our eyes, but people can sleep with them open (they just don't see anything through them). Then there are the skeletal muscles - the ones that control limbs and so on. These are usually relaxed during sleep, but somnambulists break this rule every time they climb out of bed and head downstairs. And they walk all over another important telltale sign of sleep, too - the supposed absence of goal-directed behaviour. The advent of the electroencephalograph (EEG) in 1929 tightened our definition of sleep. This machine can detect electrical brain activity and translate it into squiggly lines on a sheet of paper. During sleep, it was found that these traces show distinctive patterns. Armed with these techniques, plus some increasingly sophisticated kit that detects neural activity, sleep theorists are now able to conduct convoluted arguments with each other about what sleep is and how it might work. Some believe it to be a passive thing - a state we fall into, characterised by a lack of activity. Others maintain that it is an active process - that sleep is initiated and maintained, possibly by one or more \"sleep centres\" in the brain. A major change in the way we think about our regular spells of unconsciousness came with the discovery that sleep has more than one form. Once upon a time, when people believed in beautiful princesses and young men thought nothing of hibernating in caves, sleep was regarded as a unitary state. We might do it well or badly, deeply or lightly, but on the whole, if we weren't awake, we were asleep. Then, in 1953, the physiologists Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman spotted something that suggested there was more to a good night's sleep than simply eight hours of shut-eye. 'Sleep is when all the unsorted stuff comes out as from a dustbin upset in a high wind.' William Golding, Pincher Martin What Aserinsky and Kleitman noticed in their lab was that, after about an hour's sleep, people's eyes started moving rapidly under their eyelids. At the same time, their EEG traces began to resemble those of subjects who were awake and alert. If the subject was woken up at this stage, they reported dreams - usually vivid, visual dreams - 20 times out of 27, compared with only four times out of 23 when their eyes and brains were less active. Now, the world of sleep research - indeed, the world at large - had an exciting and baffling new concept to play with. It was called Rapid Eye Movement sleep, or REM sleep for short. And with it, by extension, came a less glamorous phenomenon known as NREM sleep, the initial \"N\" simply standing for \"non\". The unitary state of sleep was now split in two; and it soon became apparent from the EEG traces that NREM sleep could itself be divided into four stages. Researchers now tell us that a typical night's sleep for an adult human will begin with a period of shallow, stage-1 sleep, during which body temperature will begin to drop (it reaches its lowest point after five or six hours). This is quickly followed by deeper, stage-2 sleep, during which an EEG will trace wave sequences known as \"sleep spindles\". Deeper sleep comes with stage 3, and here there are high-voltage EEG tracings with an increasing predominance of so-called delta-wave activity. Gradually, the body falls into the very deepest form of sleep, known as stage-4 sleep, and now the brain reverberates with those big, slow delta waves. After the depths of stage 4, sleep eases back to stage 3, followed by a second period of stage 2. Then, after 70 to 90 minutes of this NREM sleep, there comes a first, brief bout of REM sleep (unlike newborn infants, adults rarely go straight into REM sleep). This first session lasts for only five to 15 minutes before the cycle begins again. But as the cycles repeat, the periods of stage-3 and stage-4 sleep shrink, and the REM sleep sessions get longer. By morning, REM sleep will have accounted for a quarter of the time spent sleeping, most of the remainder being stage-2 sleep. REM sleep is also known as \"paradoxical sleep\", because a subject in REM sleep often resembles someone who is wide awake. EEG patterns in the deeper stages of NREM sleep (also called \"orthodox\" sleep) are those associated with decreased vigilance during wakefulness, and in many ways NREM sleep, particularly in the deeper stages, resembles the sort of restful state - slow breathing, reduced heart rate and blood pressure - that body and brain might need to recuperate. By contrast, brain wave activity, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure all rise again during REM sleep, and can fluctuate rapidly. As well as those rapid eye movements, there are fast, small and irregular brain waves, and various other indications of arousal. Yet at the same time muscle tone reduces so drastically as to amount to temporary paralysis, almost as if our bodies were trying to prevent us from acting out our dreams. And what a temptation that is. For while most of the dreams recalled by subjects roused during NREM sleep are said to be thoughtlike and realistic, resembling the experiences of wakefulness, REM dreams are something else entirely. 'Sleep hath its own world, And a wide realm of wild reality, And dreams in their development have breath, And tears, and tortures, and the touch of Joy.' Byron, The Dream You are driving along the motorway, intent on delivering a lightbulb to someone you met briefly on a boat. But why are you going to all this trouble? The intended recipient of this strange gift is now naked and beckoning you from the back seat. Pulling back on the steering wheel (careful it doesn't come off in your hands again), you manage to put the car into a steep climb before squeezing yourself between the front seats (how annoying that they seem to be covered with orange prickles) and joining your passenger. But not so fast. The manoeuvre has upset the balance of the vehicle and you are falling, falling... Just then, you remember that you can, in fact, fly - that you always could fly, until, that is, your sister started working every weekday afternoon for a charity shop in Pennsylvania. It's all good knockabout fun, this dreaming caper, and the indications are that it's enjoyed by monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, shrews, opossums and even some reptiles and birds (recent research suggests that songbirds practise singing in their sleep). But humans have never been able to leave it at that. Right from the word go, we have assumed - not unreasonably, perhaps - that these super-real experiences must mean something. They are coded messages from the gods, glimpses into the future or insights into our state of health. Throughout the ancient world, the sick would flock to specially dedicated temples (the Greeks had 600 of them) to \"incubate\" dreams, which they would then describe to priests in order to receive appropriate cures. The Egyptians and Babylonians produced great catalogues of dream interpretations, and all across the Middle East dreams were used to divine the future (the Old Testament is full of such prophetic dreams, notably those of Joseph, Jacob and the pharaohs). In many societies, dreams have been placed on an equal footing with reality and sometimes accorded superior status. Western philosophers have had similar difficulties drawing an indisputable dividing line between fact and fiction; and Bertrand Russell articulated the thought that at some time has crossed the minds of most of us: namely, that we cannot know for sure that so-called reality is anything other than an extended nightmare. It was Aristotle in the 4th century BC who first suggested that dreams might be nothing more than sensory impressions from external objects - \"pauses within the body . . . eddies . . . of sensory movement, often remaining like they were when they first started, but often too broken into other forms by collision with obstacles\". He noted that sensory function is reduced in sleep, and he thought this might make dreams more susceptible to emotional distortions. Not until the 1850s, when the French physician Alfred Maury studied more than 3,000 reported recollections of dreams, did such natural ideas begin to supplant the supernatural. Maury concluded that dreams resulted from the misinterpretation of sense impressions during sleep, and wrote that one night part of his bed had fallen on to the back of his neck, causing him to dream in an instant that he had been tried by a revolutionary tribunal, condemned to death and executed by guillotine. In 1900, Sigmund Freud put dreams right at the heart of what was, in effect, a new branch of science, complete with its own language. In a book called The Interpretation Of Dreams, he argued that the events that occur in a dream (the manifest content) are the disguised expression of unconscious desires (the latent content) that are kept out of the conscious mind (repressed) on account of their unacceptable nature (ie, they frequently concern sex or hostility). But although such forbidden impulses can be expressed during sleep, they must still be coded in such a way that the dreamer does not recognise them upon waking. By a process that Freud called \"dreamwork\", he believed that these impulses were transformed into symbolic images that derived from such diverse stimuli as pressure in the bladder, experiences from the previous day (day residues) and infantile memories. Like the priests of ancient Greece, a therapist might translate these symbols back into their original form during psychoanalysis in order to understand what is really going on in the patient's head. Dreams, Freud maintained, were therefore nothing less than \"the royal road to the unconscious\". Carl Jung famously disagreed with all this, arguing instead that dreams balanced whatever elements of the dreamer's character are under-represented in the way they live their lives.

'The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.' Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream An obvious problem for anyone engaged in the study of dreams is that only the dreamer knows what went on in the dream.

Dream Dictionary describes itself as 'the new presentation of an ancient wisdom', and there you'll find all the old favourites. But tread carefully - the meaning of, say, water in a dream 'depends on the details and the action, but as a general guide, clear calm water is a favourable omen, while rough or murky water signifies difficulties'. Hot water 'portends a season of social and/or business setbacks', while running water predicts 'lasting happiness'. You could, in fact, work out most of these symbols for yourself. A dog represents fidelity and friendship, but a vicious dog denotes aggression. Dolphins denote intelligence, oak trees symbolise strength, rocks represent obstacles, and pendulums presage a change of plan. Here are some of the most common dream elements: Teeth: If your teeth fall out in your dreams, it may be that you fear powerlessness, or sexual impotence. You need to assert yourself more, and have a higher regard for your own opinion. Exams: If you find yourself sitting an exam in your dreams, but you don't understand the question, it's likely that you are being somehow judged or tested in your waking life. Your anxiety and frustration in the dream suggest your feelings of inadequacy. Being chased: Again, the general anxieties in your life are being transferred to a dream. Your pursuer may well represent a part of yourself, or your own feelings of fear, jealousy or anger, which turn on you in your dream and threaten to harm you. Flying: Often, the experience of flying in a dream is exhilarating. Flying with ease suggests that you are on top of things, while having difficulties staying aloft implies that you are struggling to control your life. Falling: Instability, insecurity, anxiety, inferiority - all the usual suspects contribute to the dream sensation of falling, which is common in the early stages of sleep and is frequently accompanied by twitches and jerks. Freud reckoned that such dreams indicate that you are about to give in to a sexual urge. Nudity: Dreaming that you are naked in public may indicate that you have something to hide, that you have made a mistake or are ashamed and insecure. If your nudity goes unnoticed, it may be that your fears are unfounded.",

With an election coming up, the government cannot be seen to endorse such a move.\" Ministers privately admit that none of the three bidders has outstanding credentials. Serco has acquired a reputation for radically changing management and has pulled out of several projects including running air traffic control at Liverpool airport. The airline consortium is said to be too close to the industry, but it has promised to run the business as a non-profit making enterprise. The unions will reluctantly back the airlines group next week and oppose Serco's move on safety grounds. But they remain strenuously opposed to the partial privatisation and have called on Lord Macdonald, transport minister, to call it off even at this late stage. Senior Nats managers said yesterday that the successful bidder, due to be announced early next month, would take over responsibility on April 1. Colin Chisholm, Nats' chief executive, warned yesterday that the handover to Swanwick from the centre at West Drayton, near Heathrow, could increase delays to passengers this summer. Controllers need to be trained up for Swanwick.",

      "body": "<p>Just how many investment banks does it take to make a Horlicks? Seventeen of the biggest were arrayed behind the flotation of Orange. And yet, four days into its second life as a public company, the mobile phone company's shares are 13% below their (much reduced) issue price. </p> <p>Outsiders have every right to be mystified by the syndicate system used to bring companies onto the stock market. In the case of Orange the system succeeded - France T\u00e9l\u00e9com has got its cash - but at a cost to the integrity of the market which could prove to be enormous. So, let's try a bit of demystification. </p> <p>The pivotal role in any initial public offering (or flotation in plain English) is fulfilled by the global coordinator. The investment bank that manages to secure this position in any IPO will enjoy the biggest chunk of the fees and commissions accruing to the phalanx of advisers. </p> <p>To earn its reward, as the title suggests, the global coordinator will mastermind the IPO's marketing campaign, maintain the book of demand generated among potential investors on the back of that campaign, and then - crucially - allocate shares to each of those would-be investors. </p> <p>Below the global coordinator in the syndicate sit, typically, two layers of other participants - the co-lead managers and, below them, the co-managers. In a deal being marketed worldwide, the co-leads are likely to have specific responsibility to lead the charge in predesignated geographical regions. The co-managers are mere foot soldiers, sweeping up demand behind the co-leads. </p> <p>An IPO may or may not include a retail marketing element. If it does, a specific amount of stock may be set aside for private investors. Demand from these investors will be collected through either a direct marketing campaign and/or specialist retail brokers. </p> <p>From the outset, the global co-ordinator will be anxious to create what is referred to as price tension. In effect this means an excess of demand for shares in the issue or, at the very least, an illusion of overdemand. The bandwagon effect is very important. Human nature being what it is, no one likes to miss out on a mass winner. </p> <p>To create price tension, the global co-ordinator encourages competition between investment banks in the syndicate, and between potential investors. </p> <p>Institutional investors place indicative buy orders in the book that is run by the global co-ordinator. They do so through one of the syndicate banks. Commission paid to each of these banks is determined by the number of shares allocated to investors they have corralled. </p> <p>Investors are urged to place their orders early during the marketing process so as to secure a favourable allocation of shares in the final reckoning. </p> <p>Most IPOs are announced with a possible price range rather than a fixed price. This allows the global co-ordinator to adjust the price to reflect demand. </p> <p>A perfectly handled deal will be one that maximises the sale price achieved by the vendors of the floating company, with the caveat that some excess demand is left so as to create upside in the share price in the aftermarket. Investors in the issue thereby receive their \"reward\" for their support. </p> <p>Every day of the marketing campaign witnesses the following dynamics: the global coordinator's syndicate desk browbeats the syndicate desks of the participating investment banks; these desks in turn berate their sales desks; these sales desks cajole potential investors. </p> <p>At the end of each day the state of the book - a closely guarded secret between vendor and global coordinator - will be examined and marketing and pricing strategies suitably refined. </p> <p>Once the campaign is complete, the book is formally closed and the global coordinator decides the allocation of shares to each investor. It will do so in consultation with the vendor, and with little regard to the views of the other syndicate members. </p> <p><strong> Rows always occur</strong><br> </p> <p> The global coordinator will maximise allocations to its own clients, reward help from others where it has to, and settle a few scores where it can. Rows always occur, and are usually resolved in favour of the global coordinator. </p> <p>The best hope the other syndicate members have is to appeal directly to the management of the company being floated - after all, it has an interest in building a register of shareholders it can work with in future. </p> <p>The system stinks, of course. Fees and commissions are high - but vendors accede to them because a successful but expensive IPO is better than a cheap flop. Junior syndicate members are dumped on by the global coordinator, but they come back for more because a small share of huge spoils is better than no share at all. Revenge can wait for a future deal when they are in the driving seat. </p> <p>The Orange fiasco will not alter the syndicate system one jot. But it will serve as a lesson in the dangers of greed and desperation. </p> <p>This deal was misconceived, mistimed and mishandled. One thing you can be sure of, it will be used as a case study by all those banks fortunate not be involved in the deal when they are next invited to enter the beauty parade for a big IPO. </p> <p>\u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk=\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Just how many investment banks does it take to make a Horlicks? Seventeen of the biggest were arrayed behind the flotation of Orange. And yet, four days into its second life as a public company, the mobile phone company's shares are 13% below their (much reduced) issue price. Outsiders have every right to be mystified by the syndicate system used to bring companies onto the stock market. In the case of Orange the system succeeded - France T\u00e9l\u00e9com has got its cash - but at a cost to the integrity of the market which could prove to be enormous. So, let's try a bit of demystification. The pivotal role in any initial public offering (or flotation in plain English) is fulfilled by the global coordinator. The investment bank that manages to secure this position in any IPO will enjoy the biggest chunk of the fees and commissions accruing to the phalanx of advisers. To earn its reward, as the title suggests, the global coordinator will mastermind the IPO's marketing campaign, maintain the book of demand generated among potential investors on the back of that campaign, and then - crucially - allocate shares to each of those would-be investors. Below the global coordinator in the syndicate sit, typically, two layers of other participants - the co-lead managers and, below them, the co-managers. In a deal being marketed worldwide, the co-leads are likely to have specific responsibility to lead the charge in predesignated geographical regions. The co-managers are mere foot soldiers, sweeping up demand behind the co-leads. An IPO may or may not include a retail marketing element. If it does, a specific amount of stock may be set aside for private investors. Demand from these investors will be collected through either a direct marketing campaign and/or specialist retail brokers. From the outset, the global co-ordinator will be anxious to create what is referred to as price tension. In effect this means an excess of demand for shares in the issue or, at the very least, an illusion of overdemand. The bandwagon effect is very important. Human nature being what it is, no one likes to miss out on a mass winner. To create price tension, the global co-ordinator encourages competition between investment banks in the syndicate, and between potential investors. Institutional investors place indicative buy orders in the book that is run by the global co-ordinator. They do so through one of the syndicate banks. Commission paid to each of these banks is determined by the number of shares allocated to investors they have corralled. Investors are urged to place their orders early during the marketing process so as to secure a favourable allocation of shares in the final reckoning. Most IPOs are announced with a possible price range rather than a fixed price. This allows the global co-ordinator to adjust the price to reflect demand. A perfectly handled deal will be one that maximises the sale price achieved by the vendors of the floating company, with the caveat that some excess demand is left so as to create upside in the share price in the aftermarket. Investors in the issue thereby receive their \"reward\" for their support. Every day of the marketing campaign witnesses the following dynamics: the global coordinator's syndicate desk browbeats the syndicate desks of the participating investment banks; these desks in turn berate their sales desks; these sales desks cajole potential investors. At the end of each day the state of the book - a closely guarded secret between vendor and global coordinator - will be examined and marketing and pricing strategies suitably refined. Once the campaign is complete, the book is formally closed and the global coordinator decides the allocation of shares to each investor. It will do so in consultation with the vendor, and with little regard to the views of the other syndicate members. Rows always occur The global coordinator will maximise allocations to its own clients, reward help from others where it has to, and settle a few scores where it can. Rows always occur, and are usually resolved in favour of the global coordinator. The best hope the other syndicate members have is to appeal directly to the management of the company being floated - after all, it has an interest in building a register of shareholders it can work with in future. The system stinks, of course. Fees and commissions are high - but vendors accede to them because a successful but expensive IPO is better than a cheap flop. Junior syndicate members are dumped on by the global coordinator, but they come back for more because a small share of huge spoils is better than no share at all. Revenge can wait for a future deal when they are in the driving seat. The Orange fiasco will not alter the syndicate system one jot. But it will serve as a lesson in the dangers of greed and desperation. This deal was misconceived, mistimed and mishandled. One thing you can be sure of, it will be used as a case study by all those banks fortunate not be involved in the deal when they are next invited to enter the beauty parade for a big IPO. \u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk",

These are the ideas of the past, they are not appropriate for the future. Also, we are not pursuing, as it is often said, a policy of a strong dollar. In my opinion a strong dollar is the result of a strong economy.\" </p> <p>The US economy has weakened dramatically since the autumn and many analysts took his remarks as a signal that Mr O'Neill was happy to see a lower dollar which would boost US exports. </p> <p>As finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven leading economies gathered for their meeting today in Palermo, a US treasury spokesman said there had been no change to policy on the dollar. </p> <p>Italy's finance minister, Vincenzo Visco, later insisted currencies were not even on the agenda. \"The problem of the exchange rate of the euro is a non-problem. A euro is a euro and a dollar is a dollar. What counts is the underlying economy.\" </p> <p>Mr Visco was confident that European economies were strong enough to bolster world growth should the US slip into recession. \"In Europe there are fewer deficits and fewer debts, and inflation is not a source of concern. Recovery is under way and the outlook is good, consumer confidence is rising. The euro has worked well. </p> <p>\"Europe must go ahead by itself and it might also have to be the locomotive [for the global economy],\" he said.</p>",

Traders dumped the greenback and bought the euro, sending the single currency close to 91.71 cents at one point in US trading, more than a cent higher than its overnight close. The US treasury was forced to issue a statement clarifying Mr O'Neill's views after the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported him as saying that the US was not pursuing a strong dollar policy. Asked by the paper whether \"a weaker dollar would come in handy for America\", Mr O'Neill replied: \"This is a crazy concept, which only economic nationalists could come up with. These are the ideas of the past, they are not appropriate for the future. Also, we are not pursuing, as it is often said, a policy of a strong dollar. In my opinion a strong dollar is the result of a strong economy.\" The US economy has weakened dramatically since the autumn and many analysts took his remarks as a signal that Mr O'Neill was happy to see a lower dollar which would boost US exports. As finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven leading economies gathered for their meeting today in Palermo, a US treasury spokesman said there had been no change to policy on the dollar. Italy's finance minister, Vincenzo Visco, later insisted currencies were not even on the agenda. \"The problem of the exchange rate of the euro is a non-problem. A euro is a euro and a dollar is a dollar. What counts is the underlying economy.\" Mr Visco was confident that European economies were strong enough to bolster world growth should the US slip into recession. \"In Europe there are fewer deficits and fewer debts, and inflation is not a source of concern. Recovery is under way and the outlook is good, consumer confidence is rising. The euro has worked well. \"Europe must go ahead by itself and it might also have to be the locomotive [for the global economy],\" he said.",

He started in business, spent the next 20 years almost continuously in government service, and returned in 1960 to the private sector. Each phase of his career covered a frequent change of duties.</p> <p>When he came down from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1929, the job which he had agreed to fill had vanished, and he spent nearly a year of frustration and disillusionment before he found another. Not only did he thus have first-hand experience of prolonged unemployment, he had worked for a year as a farm labourer, and for several months as a general handyman at a hospital. Earlier, he had been to school in Switzerland and, for a short time, to university in Hamburg.</p> <p>After a spell of going round companies trying to sell them telephone equipment, Plowden joined the city firm of C Tennant Sons &amp; Co, dealers in commodities. As he spoke both French and German and knew the continent well, he was put in charge of selling Palestine potash, in competition with the European potash cartel; he did so to such effect that his firm, as it had hoped, was invited to join the cartel.</p> <p>When war broke out, Plowden reported for work in the Ministry of Economic Warfare, based at what is now the London School of Economics. This was on advice given him by Desmond Morton that the war would be won by blockade. Once this view lost all plausibility, he moved to the newly-formed Ministry of Aircraft Production, in which he remained until 1946, ending up in 1945-46 as chief executive in succession to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfred Freeman.</p> <p>It was during his first year in the ministry that I first encountered Plowden, and came to appreciate his courage and good sense. I was anxious to obtain agreement to substantial reductions in bulk imports of ore, in order to save shipping space, but had little hope of persuading an official in a ministry then headed by Lord Beaverbrook to accept, spontaneously, a cut in the programme for bauxite. Plow- den, however, agreed unhesitatingly.</p> <p>His qualities of character clearly impressed the Labour politician Sir Stafford Cripps when he came to the department in 1942, and it was the high opinion of Plowden he formed in wartime that led Cripps, as chancellor of the exchequer in the postwar Labour government, to appoint him chief planning officer in March 1947, after the debacle of the fuel crisis. For the next three years, Plowden was Cripps's principal adviser while he was gradually bringing the economy back under control. As Robert Hall put it: \"Cripps is the undisputed master in the field . . . and Plowden has been his prophet.\"</p> <p>Plowden, who was no economist, relied heavily on the advice of Hall, whose appointment as director of the economic section at the Cabinet Office in succession to James Meade, followed closely on Plowden's. The pair made a powerful team: Hall supplied the arguments and Plowden applied the persuasion. Together they played a major role in the devaluation of 1949, in re- armament in 1950, and in thwarting, in 1952, \"Operation Robot\" - the plan to make sterling convertible by blocking sterling balances and floating the pound.</p> <p>In 1948, Hall entered in his diary: \"Edwin Plowden and I get almost anything we want, and we don't really know enough to justify this faith in us.\" Four years later, William Armstrong, then principal private secretary to the chancellor, concluded that \"the Plowden-Hall team is the strongest force in Whitehall, since ministers will not accept anything that they strongly disapprove.\"</p> <p>Plowden was also trusted by Hugh Gaitskell, Labour's chancellor from 1950-51, and gives the impression in his memoir, An Industrialist In The Treasury, of having been equally close to Gaitskell's Conservative successor, RA \"Rab\" Butler, who called him \"my faithful watchdog-in-chief.\" The testimony of Hall, however, makes it clear that for most of his two years with Butler, Plowden did not enjoy the chancellor's full confidence, and this reacted on his efficiency as an adviser. So, too, did the divisions within the Treasury over Robot. He was often moody and uncertain, as if he had lost his way and his nerve.</p> <p>Plowden worked best as an adviser in an atmosphere of mutual trust, in which he could count on his minister's support and tell him exactly what he thought, not hesitating to stick his neck out. But he had spasms of inner uncertainty in which he would ask Hall, \"Do we do any good?\", and contemplate throwing up his job. In 1951, he had doubted whether he would survive a change of government, and remained hesitant about his future when reappointed. After the Robot episode, both Butler and Edward Bridges, permanent secretary at the Treasury, thought privately that he would be wise to leave, but he remained for a further year.</p> <p>In 1953, Plowden moved to the Atomic Energy Organisation, rejecting a tempting offer from Bowater's, and remained chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority from 1954 to 1959. This allowed him to keep in touch with Whitehall, and time to remain abreast of academic opinion as a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford.</p> <p>I n the 1960s, when he resumed a business career as chairman of Tube Investments (along with other directorships), he embarked on a succession of public duties, often as chairman of a government committee. The first of these was the Treasury committee of inquiry in 1959-61 into the control of public expenditure, which urged the planning of public expenditure on a long-term footing, and helped to shape the system in use until the introduction of cash limits in the mid-1970s.</p> <p>This was followed by committees on overseas representation, the aircraft industry, the electricity supply indus try and (as deputy chairman) the police. Indeed, Plowden's association with the police included chairmanship of the police complaints board for five years and of the police negotiating board for three.</p> <p>He was also called upon to chair the top salaries review body for nine years under Margaret Thatcher, who gave a special lunch for him at No 10 Downing Street on his retirement. A longer-term interest than any of these was his association with the London Business School; he took a leading part in its foundation, and remained attached to it as chairman or president from 1964 onwards. He was made a life peer in 1959.</p> <p>How was it that someone so unassuming as Edwin Plowden, with no obvious advantages and in a relatively obscure business post, should become in a few years so powerful a figure in the nation's affairs? The answer lay in his combination of courage and integrity.

Directed by Budd Boetticher, these B-movies (around 70 minutes long) were as taut and laconic as their hero, with plots told with an unselfconscious narrative force. \"My theory has always been to write a real small story against a big background,\" Kennedy explained.</p> <p>Boetticher thought Kennedy an ideal writer for his films because \"he likes action as opposed to dialogue. He thinks visually - in everything he does.\" According to Kennedy: \"If you can do it visually, it's always better. And it's actually easier to write that way. I don't overwrite, but the more detail I go into describing a setting, the easier it is for me to visualise what happens there.\"</p> <p>Kennedy's witty and gripping scripts contained complex themes of morality, where the heroes (not all good) and villains (not all bad) always respect each other, even though they know they will ultimately have to shoot it out. For example, at the end of The Tall T, when Richard Boone is walking away, he says to Scott: \"You wouldn't shoot me in the back. I'm going to get on my horse and ride out of here.\" Scott replies: \"Don't do it, Frank.\" This is the first time in the picture that Scott has called Boone by any name.</p> <p>Kennedy's westerns also revolve around issues of pride and loneliness. \"I liked the loner,\" he explained. \"I always thought that one secret of a good western is that the leading man should be able to walk away at any point, but he chooses not to, and that's what makes him a hero.\" This is expressed in Ride Lonesome, when lawman Scott, having avenged his wife's death, symbolically burns down the tree on which she was hanged, and refuses to participate in the happy ending enjoyed by the other characters.</p> <p>Kennedy was born in Michigan, the son of vaudevillians who toured as the Dancing Kennedys. He joined the act when he was four years old. After high school, he joined the US army, fighting in the Pacific during the second world war. He was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Settling in Hollywood, he became a successful radio writer.</p> <p>John Wayne recognised his talent and hired him to write screenplays for his production company. Kennedy's first script was Seven Men From Now, in which Randolph Scott plays a marshal hell-bent on revenge on the outlaws who killed his wife. The showdown has Scott facing Lee Marvin. \"Randy shoots Marvin, but Budd had Randy put his gun away and sit down,\" Kennedy related. \"Randy had really hated to kill this guy and I told Budd, Randy wouldn't even pay attention about putting his gun away, he'd just sit down on this rock with the gun in his hand. Little things make a lot of difference.\"</p> <p>Apart from the Boetticher-Scott movies, Kennedy wrote Six Black Horses (1962), in which Audie Murphy and Dan Duryea face each other in style. By the time of the latter, Kennedy had directed his first film, The Canadians (1961), starring Robert Ryan as a Mountie. \"I didn't know what I was doing,\" Kennedy recalled. \"I remember the first shot had like 400 horses in it, and I got the shot and the cameraman said, 'What do we do now?' And I thought, 'You mean I gotta do more?' So that's the reason I went into television (The Virginian, Lawman) to find out how you shoot pictures.'\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, as the western declined in the 1960s, it was too often drowned in blood or sniggers. Most of Kennedy's films opted for that uncomfortable genre the comedy western, though they were more agreeable than most. The Rounders (1965) was a buddy-buddy film with Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda; Support Your Local Sheriff (1969) was an amusing spoof which played on the clich\u00e9 of a stranger (James Garner) riding into town who is appointed sher iff.

On May 23 the Dachauer Zeitung said the camp was Germany's most famous place and brought \"new hope to the Dachau business world\". By 1934 the main and widely read Nazi-owned paper Volkische Beobachter was reporting a widening of policy to other \"political criminals\" including Jews accused of race defilement. By 1936 communist prisoners were no longer mentioned: in a photo-essay in the SS paper Das Schwarze Korps emphasised the camps as places for \"race defilers, rapists, sexual degenerates and habitual criminals\".</p> <p>This broadening mission, as Gellately calls it, was reflected in Volkische Beobachter photographs of \"typical subhumans\" including Jews with \"deformed headshapes\". For the first time their detention was said to be permanent. In January, 1937 Berliner Borsen Zeitung reported the SS chief Heinrich Himmler as announcing the need for \"still more camps\" for \"those with hydrocephalus, cross-eyed, deformed half-Jews and a whole series of racially inferior types\".</p> <p>In November, 1938 the anti-Jewish pogrom on and after \"the night of broken glass\" was reported countrywide in papers as heroic. The propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, announced that the \"final answer\" to the Jewish problem would be by way of government de cree, according to Volkische Beobachter</p> <p>In late 1939, the year war started, newspapers acting on government orders announced a post-8pm curfew on all Jews in case they \"molest Aryan women\". That November the first summary executions of \"anti-socials\" by police without trial were reported. Papers were told to report these clearly and forcefully. In March, 1941 the Hamburger Fremdenblatt reported the first mass auctions of posses sions of detained or killed Jews. Hamburg became the wartime clearing house and Gellately says at least 100,000 citizens bought at the auctions.</p> <p>After this the focus switched. Most press reports about Jews were about those outside Germany. This was because the official but unpublicised final solution was being implemented. But enthusiastic denunciations by ordinary citizens of Jewish and other \"internal enemies\" continued to be copiously reported. Backing Hitler discusses 670 cases. By the end of the war Hitler was still getting 1,000 private letters a week, many of them denunciations.</p> <p>Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany (OUP, \u00a319.99) will be published on March 8.

The propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, announced that the \"final answer\" to the Jewish problem would be by way of government de cree, according to Volkische Beobachter In late 1939, the year war started, newspapers acting on government orders announced a post-8pm curfew on all Jews in case they \"molest Aryan women\". That November the first summary executions of \"anti-socials\" by police without trial were reported. Papers were told to report these clearly and forcefully. In March, 1941 the Hamburger Fremdenblatt reported the first mass auctions of posses sions of detained or killed Jews. Hamburg became the wartime clearing house and Gellately says at least 100,000 citizens bought at the auctions. After this the focus switched. Most press reports about Jews were about those outside Germany. This was because the official but unpublicised final solution was being implemented. But enthusiastic denunciations by ordinary citizens of Jewish and other \"internal enemies\" continued to be copiously reported. Backing Hitler discusses 670 cases. By the end of the war Hitler was still getting 1,000 private letters a week, many of them denunciations. Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany (OUP, \u00a319.99) will be published on March 8. Prof Gellately will talk about his research at the Wiener Library, London W1 at 6.30pm on March 6. For invitations ring Coleen Hatrick, OUP at 01865 267240.",

      "bodyText": "The former tycoon Stephen Hinchliffe, who once controlled almost 1,000 high street shops, was jailed for five years yesterday after being convicted of bribing a bank manager to fund his retail empire. Hinchliffe, 51, whose Facia group owned top names such as Sock Shop and Freeman Hardy Willis before its collapse in 1996, paid \u00a3800,000 in backhanders to John Doherty in return for millions of pounds in unsecured loans, the Old Bailey was told. Doherty, 44, who was also jailed for five years, had \"ruled the roost\" at the London branch of Israeli-based United Mazrahi Bank where he was chief lending officer, and was so highly regarded that no one questioned where the money had actually gone. Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, said Sheffield-based Hinchliffe had been prepared to pay \"anything to anybody\" in order to build up his \"ramshackle empire\". He had formed a series of \"shell\" companies which he used to borrow money for the group but, with the exception of fashion chain Red or Dead, they were all losing money. Before his fall, Hinchliffe was known as a man who enjoyed the high life. His imposing villa in the Sheffield suburb of Dore was home to his many classic cars and his corporate headquarters had a disco in the basement. Impressive All this appeared to be funded by his impressive retail operation. As well as Freeman Hardy Willis shoe shops and Red or Dead, Hinchliffe also bought shops including Salisbury's accessories stores and the fashion chain Contessa. But by the mid-1990s his empire came tumbling down after it was revealed he owed the bank \u00a310m, although the prosecution believed he benefited from around \u00a313.5m of the bank's money. Branding him a \"ruined man\" and the \"author of his own misfortune\", Judge Graham Boal said he had no prospect of returning to the business world \"except in a lowly and mundance capacity\". Hinchliffe, 51, an imposing man at 6ft 5ins tall with sun-bleached blond hair and broad Yorkshire accent, stood expressionless in the dock along with his three co-defendants. His days of being regarded as a legendary figure in south Yorkshire - a reputation partly earned by his 15% stake in Sheffield United football club - were all but forgotten. Despite his extravagance, Hinchcliffe had humble beginnings. The son of a civil servant, he went to New College, Oxford, but according to the Sheffield Star, Hinch cliffe dropped out to train as an accountant. Evidence of his deal-making prowess, however, came as early as 1984. After dabbling in the grocery trade, he bought - and transformed - the Sheffield-based Wades department stores. Hinchcliffe turned a \u00a32m loss into a \u00a32m profit and sold the chain for \u00a320m. Much of the proceeds were put into James Wilkes, a small Sheffield engineering company where he ended up as chairman, and profits rose elevenfold in five years. \"The Hinch\", as he became known, was getting noticed. It was also here that Hinchliffe's taste for the good life first became obvious. The firm's headquarters were moved into the 17th Century stately home of Beauchief Hall, which had a disco in the basement. Never the orthodox businessman, Hinchliffe courted controversy. In the early nineties, battling to save his company from the clutches of a rival firm, he was arrested by the West Midlands fraud squad in connection with an investigation into a separate company. Although never charged, he parted company with Wilkes with a \u00a3533,000 pay-off. For once his Midas touch deserted him, and a number of failures, including a tennis court surfacer, soccer kit firm and retail company, seemed to haunt Hinchcliffe. It was not until 1994 that he bounced back. After persuading Doherty, chief lending officer of United Mizrahi Bank, to loan \u00a33m he bought the leather goods chain Salisbury's, which became the cornerstone of Hinchcliffe's Facia empire. This deal prompted a rapid series of acquisitions which saw high street names Sock Shop, Torq jewellers, fashion chain Red or Dead, Contessa and a trio of shoe shop chains in Trueform, Saxone and Freeman Hardy Willis swallowed up. A Sikorsky helicopter, owned by Gerald Ratner before the jeweller's collapse, was also purchased. However, it was not long before cracks started appearing in Hinchliffe's business. Suspicions were aroused when he failed to file accounts for the group in 1996 and asked to try to renegotiate the \u00a348m annual rent bill on his shops, asking landlords to accept one month's advance instead of the usual three. With the threat of a fine if he did not file the accounts, the United Mizrahi Bank told him he would have to find a new lender and the auditors responsible for endorsing the accounts of Sock Shop and Salisbury's refused to give unqualified approval to the company's finances. The final straw came when Sears, which sold him Saxone but retained rental rights, pulled the plug after concluding he would be unable to continue. Facia group crashed with debts of \u00a370m in June 1996. Receivers were appointed and in December an investigation was started by the serious fraud office. Yesterday Hinchliffe's exploits were laid bare. After bank manager Doherty was sacked his replacement immediately took steps to recover the money. Facia collapsed in June 1996 and the receivers were called in. In December 1998 Hinchliffe and three others were charged. Hinchliffe, chairman and chief executive of Facia, was found guilty yesterday of 10 corruption charges and one of conspiracy to defraud, while pony-tailed Doherty, of Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, pleaded guilty to 16 charges of conspiracy and corruption. Paul Brady, head of trade finance at the bank, was also jailed for two years, while South London businessman Robert Leckie, described by the judge as a \"seedy conman\" who allowed money to be laundered through offshore accounts, was given a 30 month term for six counts of corruption. Hinchliffe was fond of saying that \"a man who has never had a blip has never tried\". His trial and subsequent sentence mean he might never get the chance to try again. From sock shops to soccer \u0095 Facia Group Started in August 1994 with the \u00a33m purchase of Salisbury's. By the mid-1990s it controlled almost 1,000 shops. The empire included top high street names such as Sock Shop, Freeman Hardy Willis, Trueform, Saxone, Contessa, Torq jewellers and Red or Dead. Facia collapsed in June 1996, with debts of at least \u00a370m. The serious fraud office began an investigation six months later. \u0095 Sheffield United Hinchliffe had a seat on the board during the early 1990s after Facia bought a 15% stake in the club. He was thwarted in his attempts to become chairman and resigned as Facia collapsed in 1996. \u0095 Knoydart Estate Hinchliffe outraged the locals after buying Knoydart estate in the west Highlands with a business partner in 1998, while under an SFO investigation. A community-led \u00a3750,000 buyout followed in May 1999, while his outstanding debts were said to be \u00a31.4m. \u0095 Hull City football club The club has been majority owned by Hinchliffe and Nick Buchanan since November 1998.

      "body": "<p>The discovery that humans have only 30,000 genes has been portrayed in some sections of the press as a victory for free will. If we\u2019ve got fewer genes, if there\u2019s less nature, the argument runs, then nurture must take up the slack, right? Perhaps because few of us know what a gene actually does, the debate about whether we are a product of our DNA or our environment rumbles on. The truth is that the two are intimately connected. It\u2019s not nature or nurture, it\u2019s both, together.</p> <p>In Proverbs, King Solomon had some advice for those rushing into print with ill-informed opinions: \u201cGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.\u201d This is exactly what Edward O. Wilson has done, man and boy, for more than 65 years. He more than anyone understands the relationship between genes and culture and it started with his ants.</p> <p>There are thousands of different species of ant, no one is sure since most of them are unknown to science, and perhaps a hundred million billion of the creatures alive at any one time. True, they haven\u2019t written any operas, but they do live in colonies of elegant social complexity. And humanity would disappear from the face of the earth without them.</p> <p>Now 71, Wilson is a tall, slender man, his upper spine crooked from years of looking earthwards. In his brightly lit laboratory behind the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, he stands over a plastic tray of pheidole rhea, remarkable for having two soldier castes. A few workers are marching up the arms of his linen jacket and across his shoulders. He smiles gently as he eases into a chair, his voice a rich, Southern drawl, even though he left Alabama for Harvard over 45 years ago. His manners are Old South as well - warm, polite and thoughtful. The bleaker inheritance of the South is there too, in a way.</p> <p>Wilson\u2019s career has been unusually fruitful. And while he has had a lifelong obsession with ants, discovering how they communicate through pheromones, he is most famous for the publication in 1975 of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, a work of deep insight that advanced evolutionary thinking and proved a Darwinian manifesto, describing social behaviour from the ants to humans. It also landed Wilson in the fight of his intellectual life. Accused of racism and misogyny, of suggesting that some human beings are genetically superior to others, of echoing Nazi doctrines on eugenics, Wilson and his ideas were splashed on the cover of Time and the front page of the New York Times. Echoes of that fight were faintly heard this week in the renewed nature or nurture debate.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine this generous and polite man at the heart of controversy, let alone one of the most fundamental and bitter scientific arguments of the 20th century. But after it was over, his position in the evolutionary firmament rose to be right up there, on the right hand of Charles Darwin himself. He has won a raft of scientific and conservation prizes, including the National Medal of Science in the US and the prestigious Craaford Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, as well as two Pulitzers, the first for On Human Nature, published in 1978 and reissued by Penguin next month, and the second in 1990 for an uncompromisingly scientific study of ants, written with his collaborator Bert H\u00f6lldobler.</p> <p>Fellow scientists acknowledge how profound his contribution has been. Jared Diamond, who has his own Pulitzer for Guns, Germs And Steel, described him as \u201cone of the 20th century\u2019s greatest thinkers,\u201d while fellow evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins admires his breadth of understanding: \u201cHe is hugely learned, not just in his field of social insects, but in anthropology and other subjects as well. He is an outstanding synthesiser, his knowledge is immense and he manages to bring it all together in a coherent way.\u201d</p> <p>The novelist Ian McEwan describes Wilson as \u201can intellectual hero\u201d, and praises the quality of his writing. \u201cFrankly, I do not know of another working scientist whose prose is better than his. He can be witty, scathing and inspirational by turns. He is a superb celebrator of science in all its manifestations, as well as being a scourge of bogus, post-modernist, relativist pseudo-science, and so-called New Age thinking.\u201d In recent years, Wilson\u2019s other great expertise, conservation biology, has returned to the side of the angels.</p> <p>In the 1950s, before his discoveries about chemical language in ants or his ideas about sociobiology, he was in New Guinea studying biogeography, the geographical spread of species, which has offered evolutionary biologists a rich hunting ground for discoveries about natural selection and the mathematical principles that underpin how environments function.</p> <p>Later, working with the brilliant population biologist Robert MacArthur, this early research formed the basis for another seminal work The Theory Of Island Biogeography. MacArthur, who died in his early 40s from renal cancer, once told Wilson that he would rather save an endangered habitat than formulate a grand scientific theory. Ironically, as the planet\u2019s last wild places effectively become islands in a sea of human development, Wilson and MacArthur\u2019s theories have become a useful tool in the conservation struggle that will dominate the 21st century.</p> <p>It is this final battle which is exercising Wilson. With the human population expected to reach 9-10bn by the end of the century and the planet in the middle of its sixth mass extinction - this time due to human activity - the next few years are critical in maintaining anything near the current level of biodiversity. His 1992 classic, The Diversity of Life, which defined our obligation to conserve ecosystems, is being reissued by Penguin in April. Wilson\u2019s interest focuses on biodiversity hotspots, a term coined by Oxford environmental scientist Norman Myers and referring to 25 areas making up an Alaska-sized 1.4% of the Earth\u2019s surface which contain 60% of the world\u2019s species. Save these areas, the theory goes, and you save a good chunk of biodiversity.</p> <p>Wilson has added his weight to Conservation International, a hard-hitting, wealthy and relatively young organisation whose board includes Intel\u2019s co-founder Gordon Moore, Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, and the actor Harrison Ford, all of whom, Wilson says, are very knowledgeable. Biodiversity might not ring any bells with British opinion formers, but in the United States it has become one of the burning issues for the nation\u2019s billionaires to support.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is so bad that even a small effort in a country like Ghana or Surinam, with what might be considered a modest investment by US standards, can make an enormous difference,\u201d Wilson says. He takes particular pleasure in CI\u2019s latest triumph, securing the logging rights to a 200,000-acre chunk of rainforest in Guyana. Communications entrepreneur Craig McCaw stumped up the $5m needed and the group has plans to repeat the exercise in Bolivia, Peru and Cambodia. In conservation terms it\u2019s a big change in direction.</p> <p>While Wilson makes no apologies for his can-do American approach to saving the planet, he doesn\u2019t attempt to defend American consumerism. \u201cWe live in a delusional state,\u201d he says of the West, finding himself in tune with more radical anti-corporatists and in complete opposition to the new Bush administration. \u201cAmerica in particular imposes an horrendous burden on the world. We have this wonderful standard of living but it comes at enormous cost.\u201d</p> <p>He goes onto describe the concept of the ecological footprint, how each American citizen requires 24 acres to sustain his or her lifestyle, while those in developing countries use a tenth of that, and adds: \u201cTo bring the world\u2019s 6bn people using today\u2019s technology up to the level of the average American will require four more Planet Earths. I\u2019ve seen the figures for this assessment, I\u2019ve repeated them in front of a wide variety of experts, nobody has refuted it. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous differential. The right-wing know-nothings in the conservative think-tanks in Washington, and the demagogues of whom we have an abundance in the US keep coming back: \u2018Well, that\u2019s what America is all about, we want the rest of the world to reach our standard, right?\u2019 Wrong! We\u2019re running out of land. The two major challenges for the 21st century are to improve the economic situation of the majority and save as much of the planet as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson\u2019s ideas for solutions will delight and appal green campaigners: \u201cThe education of women is the best way to save the environment,\u201d he begins, highlighting over-population. He also wants smaller cars, greater water efficiency and more vegetarianism: \u201c75% of the surface area of Los Angeles is given over to the automobile,\u201d he says \u201cand reducing the impact of cars is the way to live better.\u201d</p> <p>But he also sees a central role for genetically modified organisms. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get it in the neck from my conservationist colleagues, but we\u2019ve got to go all out on genetically modified crops. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any other way of creating the next green revolution without GMOs. The last green revolution saved millions from starvation but it did so at immense environmental cost. [The new revolution] has got to work at two levels, using new plants that are outside our current habits, but also by using GMOs. We\u2019ve got to be able to cultivate dry ranch land with the right crops; we\u2019ve got to be able to convert wasteland, including the low biodiversity salt flats or areas destroyed by overuse and abandoned.\u201d</p> <p>Fate seems to have driven Wilson to being an entomologist. In his frank and compassionate autobiography Naturalist, he remembers his first connection with nature aged seven, at around the time of his parents\u2019 divorce. While they fought it out at home, he was sent away to Paradise Beach in Florida. In the fish and other creatures he saw another world he could escape to. His father, in later life an alcoholic who committed suicide rather than face chronic ill-health, moved restlessly from city to city almost every year, working as a government accountant, and he took his son with him.</p> <p>Natural history became the constant in Wilson\u2019s life, and each new town his father lived in offered contrasting environments to explore. Short, skinny and by his own admission somewhat geekish, Wilson nevertheless stood his ground in the inevitable confrontation with the neighbourhood bully at each new school, among them the Gulf Coast Military Academy, which he described as \u201ca carefully planned nightmare engineered for the betterment of the untutored and undisciplined\u201d. In his autobiography he says that at 13, he was a workaholic with a \u201cmonster\u201d paper round, getting up at 3 am to deliver 420 copies of the local newspaper before school. He had friends, often those who shared his love of nature and the freedom of being outdoors, and he was physically brave, but as a child he was always the stranger, never on the inside. He has also said that as a child \u201cthe Boy Scouts of America seemed invented just for me\u201d. He still \u201creads with remembered pleasure\u201d his original 1940 Handbook For Boys, bought for half a dollar.</p> <p>\u201cIt was packed with useful information on the subjects I liked the most. It stressed outdoor life and natural history: camping, hiking, swimming...\u201d The other defining influence on his eventual specialty was pure accident. While at Paradise Beach, he was fishing for a type of perch off the docks. Striking too hard on a biting fish, it flew from the water and its needle-like spines embedded in the pupil of Wilson\u2019s right eye. Eventually the wound required surgery, leaving Wilson traumatised with a phobia of his face being covered - a consequence of the anaesthesia - and full sight in only his left eye, and only then at close range.</p> <p>This disability, coupled with poor hearing, probably inherited, left him ill-equipped for studying birds or frogs, which he couldn\u2019t hear or see well. So he opted instead for those creatures that could be observed right under his nose. While he talks freely about his childhood, he is more reticent about his later family life and rarely alludes in interviews to his wife Renee and daughter Cathy. Wilson is fascinated by early memories, not trusting them but still enthralled at the mythologies we build around ourselves; he cannot resist the point where his genetic inheritance meets his own experience as an individual - which includes his childhood religious phase - a point which his research has focused on. After his parents\u2019 divorce in Pensacola, Florida, he lived with a family friend, Belle Raub, and came to share her faith, although he preferred his family\u2019s Baptist background to \u201cMother\u201d Raub\u2019s Methodism.</p> <p>He describes himself in his most recent work Consilience as having been \u201claid backward under the water on the arm of a sturdy pastor\u201d and while his atheism was complete before he went to university, he understands the need of what he calls the transcendental experience at the heart of human nature.</p> <p>One of his major contributions has been, with the physicist turned biologist Charles Lumsden, the idea of \u201cgene-culture co-evolution\u201d. It is hardly an elegant term, and one that receives a very mixed response, but essentially it describes how culture and genetics intertwine to create the complexity of human life. In essence, he has reached for the biological roots of culture.</p> <p>A straightforward example would be the tolerance of some but not other human societies to the lactose in cow\u2019s milk. A subtler example is the mythological status snakes - the serpent of Eden, Ouroboros in Greek myth - hold in most cultures. There is a genetic advantage to avoiding snakes; culture takes that inherent fear and reinforces it through art, spiritual ceremonies or narratives. While still a teenager, Wilson became enthralled by the ideas of the modern synthesis, the combination of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian genetics, catalysed by Theodosius Dobzhansky\u2019s Genetics And The Origin Of Species.</p> <p>Wilson\u2019s particular hero was Ernst Mayr, the architect of neo-Darwinism and later a colleague at Harvard. Wilson read Mayr\u2019s Systematics and Origin Of Species at 18. \u201cWhen I saw there was a whole system of science based on genetics, of serious work in the evolutionary pattern, that was an epiphany. Everything I loved and wanted to do in life was in patterns, it made sense, whereas the traditional explanations for everything didn\u2019t. It opened the door to me, thinking hard about other aspects like morality and religion, although I didn\u2019t do much about that until I reached my 40s.\u201d</p> <p>Working with social insects put Wilson at the heart of the next expansion of understanding in evolutionary biology - social behaviour. Until the 1950s, behaviour had been the preserve of social scientists; most biologists didn\u2019t see it as part of their field. Wilson was given a post-grad student, Stuart Altmann, who was studying the social behaviour of rhesus macaque monkeys. Together, they discussed common themes in social behaviour, Wilson supplying his experience of ants.</p> <p>The tiny insects had evolved to perform tasks in just the right numbers and with just the right adaptations. You could, Wilson and others discovered, formulate mathematical equations which predicted a wide range of behaviour, right down to what Wilson termed \u201cadaptive demography\u201d, altering birth rates to suit the prevailing conditions. Other aspects of ant behaviour could be triggered with the chemical signals that he discovered. By dipping bits of paper in the juice of dead ants, Wilson prompted live ants to carry the paper from their nests, just as they do with the corpses of their sisters. Ant behaviour wasn\u2019t learned, it was instinctive.</p> <p>There were other strands in Wilson\u2019s synthesis, like new ideas on aggression, but the most important was British evolutionary biologist William Hamilton\u2019s explanation of kin selection. Darwin had spotted that ant castes threatened his idea of natural selection; here was a group of animals that apart from the queens didn\u2019t reproduce but worked cooperatively for the good of the colony. How to explain such altruism in Darwinian terms of natural selection? Hamilton\u2019s answer was that siblings will sacrifice themselves for the propagation of the genes they share. The idea had been suggested before, but Hamilton dressed it in calculus and made it demonstrable.</p> <p>The story of how Wilson read Hamilton\u2019s paper on a train journey from Harvard to Florida during which he became converted to Hamilton\u2019s view is scientific folklore. Was he disappointed to have missed such a major piece of the evolutionary puzzle? \u201cAs a researcher in social insects,I should have seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s importance was even greater than I originally thought. But I wasn\u2019t really disappointed. By then, I was in the process of synthesising; I wasn\u2019t so much concerned about making individual discoveries. What I was doing was working out the chemical language of ants, and that\u2019s an important part of sociobiology too.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton is a compelling figure, described by John Maynard Smith as \u201cthe only bloody genius we\u2019ve got\u201d, and Wilson, among others, championed his cause. Self-effacing, but at times almost mystical in his approach to biology, Hamilton died last year, apparently of malaria, after going to the Congo to help research Edward Hooper\u2019s theories about the origins of Aids. Talking about him, Wilson seems almost bereft. Was he surprised by his death? \u201cNot overly surprised, but I was shocked.\u201d</p> <p>Once Wilson would have followed Hamilton into the jungle, now he seems almost angry that his friend is gone. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he was doing a lot of the time, because he didn\u2019t seem to be doing research or getting published. He just loved going to difficult places. I didn\u2019t understand what he was doing in the Congo. He could have handled those questions from a remote distance.\u201d Like Wilson, Hamilton was also attacked - the anthropologist SL Washburn dismissed his ideas on human sociobiology as \u201creductionist, racist and ridiculous\u201d - but Wilson was far more visible, publishing three books in the 1970s on the subject, starting with The Insect Societies in 1971. Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, the title echoing Wilson\u2019s heroes of the 1930s, was published in 1975.</p> <p>Had it dealt only with animals it would have been accepted as a major work with many important ideas crystallised - in 1989, fellows of the Animal Behaviour Society voted it the most influential book on animal behaviour of all time. But by including a final chapter, 30 pages out of almost 600, on the ultimate social animal, homo sapiens, Wilson was lighting the blue touch-paper. Because while the world was content to allow evolution to explain why and how another species is created and how it might behave, the human mind remained off-limits, the preserve of social scientists and theologians, philosophers and novelists. Anyone, it seemed, but biologists.</p> <p>Old scientific controversies are often unpalatable when reheated, but the furore generated by Sociobiology rumbles on. Nor did Wilson duck the opportunity to flag his theories. \u201cLet us now consider man in the free spirit of natural history,\u201d the chapter begins, echoing the Psalms Wilson read as a boy. People are animals, their behaviour has evolved just like that of the animals, and our culture has a biological component, he announced. Human sexuality has evolved in certain ways for specific reasons, all through natural selection. It seemed to some that he was undermining human dignity. Others bristled at an intellectual threat.</p> <p>\u201cTactically he was unwise,\u201d says Richard Dawkins, \u201cbecause it appeared to sociologists and anthropologists that he was empire-building. It sounded threatening, as though here was a biologist trying to move in on their territory. That caused a lot of ruffled feathers which may not have helped matters.\u201d</p> <p>By talking so starkly in terms of the genetic foundation of human behaviour, Wilson offered himself up to more political minds who had much to lose intellectually if his ideas were right. Opposition emerged at several levels, the most conspicuous from radical students who denounced him publicly at his lectures and on campus. At the height of the controversy, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a debate he joined on sociobiology was interrupted by demonstrators who poured a pitcher of water over his head; psychologically bewildering for a gentle man more used to debate than demonstration.</p> <p>But the real opposition to Wilson\u2019s ideas, the attacks that hurt, came from within his own department, from the Marxist biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. The two camps crystallised two views of humanity: the first, that our psychology and social behaviour have evolved along with the rest of us and that every facet of human behaviour, even, say, homosexuality, is influenced by our genetic inheritance; and the second, that the human mind somehow escapes natural selection and answers to another, higher epistemology.</p> <p>Gould and Lewontin believed that \u201cthe purpose of critical science is to promote socialism, which is the only just form of government\u201d, and they saw sociobiology, erroneously as it turns out, as an inherently right-wing, individualistic philosophy. They accused Wilson of sending human nature back to the concentration camps. Wilson isn\u2019t a determinist who believes that life is purely mechanistic, and he isn\u2019t right-wing - he remains a Democrat and fears the environmental worst from the George Bush presidency. Although Wilson argued that homosexuality might have a genetic element, he also argued that it was therefore natural and should be tolerated. But Gould was good-humoured and discursive, taking an apparently compassionate view of human nature, and Lewontin, a population geneticist who could show that racial differences are genetically tiny, added credence to charges of racism, even though Wilson hadn\u2019t brought the subject up.</p> <p>Did he think that his opponents were themselves guilty of prejudice? \u201cThey were, although they never admitted it,\u201d Wilson says slowly, reaching for the words. \u201cI came from the Old South, I was raised as a racist. I mean, we all were. It was only in my teens that I began to change. But here, if you were called racist - well, in the 70s it was like a death sentence.\u201d</p> <p>The wounds from this fight seem fresh even now, probably because, as Dawkins suggests, the assault came from so close to home and without warning: \u201cThey did this thing in print without giving him the slightest inkling what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first Wilson knew about it was when he saw their really very vicious tirade in the New York Review of Books, and I think he felt keenly the discourtesy of them not popping down the hall to talk to him about it.\u201d \u201cThat was excruciating,\u201d Wilson agrees, but if the argument was wearying, Wilson\u2019s intellectual steel glints when he summarises the current position.</p> <p>\u201cI think the sociobiology controversy is essentially over. The contraries are ageing. No young scientists are joining. They are not handing on the torch but passing it around a smaller and smaller circle.\u201d</p> <p>He acknowledges one charge as having validity, the accusation from more thoughtful feminists that he had over-simplified the role of women. \u201cAs time has gone on two things have happened,\u201d he says. \u201cOne is that we are vastly better informed about gender differences, their genetic and physiological bases, right down to fine- tuning of hormonal regulation of behaviour. Another thing is that scientists like Sarah Hardy have been able to demonstrate a far greater richness of female flexibility in reproductive strategies. It\u2019s far more subtle and sophisticated than we anticipated. The theory in the 70s was that women were more passive, judging between male capacities, but now we know that women are vastly more powerful than that in establishing relationships.\u201d</p> <p>With sociobiology prospering, Wilson has carried his research into the full arena of human knowledge, publishing the hugely ambitious Consilience in 1998, in which he developed his ideas about gene-culture co-evolution further and resurrected CP Snow\u2019s efforts to conjoin the \u201ctwo cultures\u201d. In fact, Wilson\u2019s arguments are more fundamental and persuasive than Snow\u2019s; works on evolution, like Sociobiology and Dawkins\u2019s The Selfish Gene, have been absorbed into western cultural life as neatly as any neo-Darwinist could have predicted.</p> <p>\u201cHe is,\u201d says Ian McEwan, \u201ca scientific materialist who warmly embraces the diversity of human achievement - including religion and art, which he sees in evolutionary terms. One of his tasks has been to further the Enlightenment project of absorbing the social sciences into science proper; another has been to find a sound ethical basis for ecological thinking. He is fundamentally a rational optimist who shows us the beauty of the narrative of life on earth. He is living proof that materialism need not be a bleak world view.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The discovery that humans have only 30,000 genes has been portrayed in some sections of the press as a victory for free will. If we\u2019ve got fewer genes, if there\u2019s less nature, the argument runs, then nurture must take up the slack, right? Perhaps because few of us know what a gene actually does, the debate about whether we are a product of our DNA or our environment rumbles on. The truth is that the two are intimately connected. It\u2019s not nature or nurture, it\u2019s both, together. In Proverbs, King Solomon had some advice for those rushing into print with ill-informed opinions: \u201cGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.\u201d This is exactly what Edward O. Wilson has done, man and boy, for more than 65 years. He more than anyone understands the relationship between genes and culture and it started with his ants. There are thousands of different species of ant, no one is sure since most of them are unknown to science, and perhaps a hundred million billion of the creatures alive at any one time. True, they haven\u2019t written any operas, but they do live in colonies of elegant social complexity. And humanity would disappear from the face of the earth without them. Now 71, Wilson is a tall, slender man, his upper spine crooked from years of looking earthwards. In his brightly lit laboratory behind the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, he stands over a plastic tray of pheidole rhea, remarkable for having two soldier castes. A few workers are marching up the arms of his linen jacket and across his shoulders. He smiles gently as he eases into a chair, his voice a rich, Southern drawl, even though he left Alabama for Harvard over 45 years ago. His manners are Old South as well - warm, polite and thoughtful. The bleaker inheritance of the South is there too, in a way. Wilson\u2019s career has been unusually fruitful. And while he has had a lifelong obsession with ants, discovering how they communicate through pheromones, he is most famous for the publication in 1975 of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, a work of deep insight that advanced evolutionary thinking and proved a Darwinian manifesto, describing social behaviour from the ants to humans. It also landed Wilson in the fight of his intellectual life. Accused of racism and misogyny, of suggesting that some human beings are genetically superior to others, of echoing Nazi doctrines on eugenics, Wilson and his ideas were splashed on the cover of Time and the front page of the New York Times. Echoes of that fight were faintly heard this week in the renewed nature or nurture debate. It is hard to imagine this generous and polite man at the heart of controversy, let alone one of the most fundamental and bitter scientific arguments of the 20th century. But after it was over, his position in the evolutionary firmament rose to be right up there, on the right hand of Charles Darwin himself. He has won a raft of scientific and conservation prizes, including the National Medal of Science in the US and the prestigious Craaford Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, as well as two Pulitzers, the first for On Human Nature, published in 1978 and reissued by Penguin next month, and the second in 1990 for an uncompromisingly scientific study of ants, written with his collaborator Bert H\u00f6lldobler. Fellow scientists acknowledge how profound his contribution has been. Jared Diamond, who has his own Pulitzer for Guns, Germs And Steel, described him as \u201cone of the 20th century\u2019s greatest thinkers,\u201d while fellow evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins admires his breadth of understanding: \u201cHe is hugely learned, not just in his field of social insects, but in anthropology and other subjects as well. He is an outstanding synthesiser, his knowledge is immense and he manages to bring it all together in a coherent way.\u201d The novelist Ian McEwan describes Wilson as \u201can intellectual hero\u201d, and praises the quality of his writing. \u201cFrankly, I do not know of another working scientist whose prose is better than his. He can be witty, scathing and inspirational by turns. He is a superb celebrator of science in all its manifestations, as well as being a scourge of bogus, post-modernist, relativist pseudo-science, and so-called New Age thinking.\u201d In recent years, Wilson\u2019s other great expertise, conservation biology, has returned to the side of the angels. In the 1950s, before his discoveries about chemical language in ants or his ideas about sociobiology, he was in New Guinea studying biogeography, the geographical spread of species, which has offered evolutionary biologists a rich hunting ground for discoveries about natural selection and the mathematical principles that underpin how environments function. Later, working with the brilliant population biologist Robert MacArthur, this early research formed the basis for another seminal work The Theory Of Island Biogeography. MacArthur, who died in his early 40s from renal cancer, once told Wilson that he would rather save an endangered habitat than formulate a grand scientific theory. Ironically, as the planet\u2019s last wild places effectively become islands in a sea of human development, Wilson and MacArthur\u2019s theories have become a useful tool in the conservation struggle that will dominate the 21st century. It is this final battle which is exercising Wilson.

Wilson\u2019s interest focuses on biodiversity hotspots, a term coined by Oxford environmental scientist Norman Myers and referring to 25 areas making up an Alaska-sized 1.4% of the Earth\u2019s surface which contain 60% of the world\u2019s species. Save these areas, the theory goes, and you save a good chunk of biodiversity. Wilson has added his weight to Conservation International, a hard-hitting, wealthy and relatively young organisation whose board includes Intel\u2019s co-founder Gordon Moore, Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, and the actor Harrison Ford, all of whom, Wilson says, are very knowledgeable. Biodiversity might not ring any bells with British opinion formers, but in the United States it has become one of the burning issues for the nation\u2019s billionaires to support. \u201cThe situation is so bad that even a small effort in a country like Ghana or Surinam, with what might be considered a modest investment by US standards, can make an enormous difference,\u201d Wilson says. He takes particular pleasure in CI\u2019s latest triumph, securing the logging rights to a 200,000-acre chunk of rainforest in Guyana. Communications entrepreneur Craig McCaw stumped up the $5m needed and the group has plans to repeat the exercise in Bolivia, Peru and Cambodia. In conservation terms it\u2019s a big change in direction. While Wilson makes no apologies for his can-do American approach to saving the planet, he doesn\u2019t attempt to defend American consumerism. \u201cWe live in a delusional state,\u201d he says of the West, finding himself in tune with more radical anti-corporatists and in complete opposition to the new Bush administration. \u201cAmerica in particular imposes an horrendous burden on the world. We have this wonderful standard of living but it comes at enormous cost.\u201d He goes onto describe the concept of the ecological footprint, how each American citizen requires 24 acres to sustain his or her lifestyle, while those in developing countries use a tenth of that, and adds: \u201cTo bring the world\u2019s 6bn people using today\u2019s technology up to the level of the average American will require four more Planet Earths. I\u2019ve seen the figures for this assessment, I\u2019ve repeated them in front of a wide variety of experts, nobody has refuted it. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous differential. The right-wing know-nothings in the conservative think-tanks in Washington, and the demagogues of whom we have an abundance in the US keep coming back: \u2018Well, that\u2019s what America is all about, we want the rest of the world to reach our standard, right?\u2019 Wrong! We\u2019re running out of land. The two major challenges for the 21st century are to improve the economic situation of the majority and save as much of the planet as we can.\u201d Wilson\u2019s ideas for solutions will delight and appal green campaigners: \u201cThe education of women is the best way to save the environment,\u201d he begins, highlighting over-population. He also wants smaller cars, greater water efficiency and more vegetarianism: \u201c75% of the surface area of Los Angeles is given over to the automobile,\u201d he says \u201cand reducing the impact of cars is the way to live better.\u201d But he also sees a central role for genetically modified organisms. \u201cI\u2019ll probably get it in the neck from my conservationist colleagues, but we\u2019ve got to go all out on genetically modified crops. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any other way of creating the next green revolution without GMOs. The last green revolution saved millions from starvation but it did so at immense environmental cost. [The new revolution] has got to work at two levels, using new plants that are outside our current habits, but also by using GMOs. We\u2019ve got to be able to cultivate dry ranch land with the right crops; we\u2019ve got to be able to convert wasteland, including the low biodiversity salt flats or areas destroyed by overuse and abandoned.\u201d Fate seems to have driven Wilson to being an entomologist. In his frank and compassionate autobiography Naturalist, he remembers his first connection with nature aged seven, at around the time of his parents\u2019 divorce. While they fought it out at home, he was sent away to Paradise Beach in Florida. In the fish and other creatures he saw another world he could escape to. His father, in later life an alcoholic who committed suicide rather than face chronic ill-health, moved restlessly from city to city almost every year, working as a government accountant, and he took his son with him. Natural history became the constant in Wilson\u2019s life, and each new town his father lived in offered contrasting environments to explore. Short, skinny and by his own admission somewhat geekish, Wilson nevertheless stood his ground in the inevitable confrontation with the neighbourhood bully at each new school, among them the Gulf Coast Military Academy, which he described as \u201ca carefully planned nightmare engineered for the betterment of the untutored and undisciplined\u201d. In his autobiography he says that at 13, he was a workaholic with a \u201cmonster\u201d paper round, getting up at 3 am to deliver 420 copies of the local newspaper before school. He had friends, often those who shared his love of nature and the freedom of being outdoors, and he was physically brave, but as a child he was always the stranger, never on the inside. He has also said that as a child \u201cthe Boy Scouts of America seemed invented just for me\u201d. He still \u201creads with remembered pleasure\u201d his original 1940 Handbook For Boys, bought for half a dollar. \u201cIt was packed with useful information on the subjects I liked the most. It stressed outdoor life and natural history: camping, hiking, swimming...\u201d The other defining influence on his eventual specialty was pure accident. While at Paradise Beach, he was fishing for a type of perch off the docks. Striking too hard on a biting fish, it flew from the water and its needle-like spines embedded in the pupil of Wilson\u2019s right eye. Eventually the wound required surgery, leaving Wilson traumatised with a phobia of his face being covered - a consequence of the anaesthesia - and full sight in only his left eye, and only then at close range. This disability, coupled with poor hearing, probably inherited, left him ill-equipped for studying birds or frogs, which he couldn\u2019t hear or see well. So he opted instead for those creatures that could be observed right under his nose. While he talks freely about his childhood, he is more reticent about his later family life and rarely alludes in interviews to his wife Renee and daughter Cathy. Wilson is fascinated by early memories, not trusting them but still enthralled at the mythologies we build around ourselves; he cannot resist the point where his genetic inheritance meets his own experience as an individual - which includes his childhood religious phase - a point which his research has focused on. After his parents\u2019 divorce in Pensacola, Florida, he lived with a family friend, Belle Raub, and came to share her faith, although he preferred his family\u2019s Baptist background to \u201cMother\u201d Raub\u2019s Methodism. He describes himself in his most recent work Consilience as having been \u201claid backward under the water on the arm of a sturdy pastor\u201d and while his atheism was complete before he went to university, he understands the need of what he calls the transcendental experience at the heart of human nature. One of his major contributions has been, with the physicist turned biologist Charles Lumsden, the idea of \u201cgene-culture co-evolution\u201d. It is hardly an elegant term, and one that receives a very mixed response, but essentially it describes how culture and genetics intertwine to create the complexity of human life. In essence, he has reached for the biological roots of culture. A straightforward example would be the tolerance of some but not other human societies to the lactose in cow\u2019s milk. A subtler example is the mythological status snakes - the serpent of Eden, Ouroboros in Greek myth - hold in most cultures. There is a genetic advantage to avoiding snakes; culture takes that inherent fear and reinforces it through art, spiritual ceremonies or narratives. While still a teenager, Wilson became enthralled by the ideas of the modern synthesis, the combination of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian genetics, catalysed by Theodosius Dobzhansky\u2019s Genetics And The Origin Of Species. Wilson\u2019s particular hero was Ernst Mayr, the architect of neo-Darwinism and later a colleague at Harvard. Wilson read Mayr\u2019s Systematics and Origin Of Species at 18. \u201cWhen I saw there was a whole system of science based on genetics, of serious work in the evolutionary pattern, that was an epiphany. Everything I loved and wanted to do in life was in patterns, it made sense, whereas the traditional explanations for everything didn\u2019t. It opened the door to me, thinking hard about other aspects like morality and religion, although I didn\u2019t do much about that until I reached my 40s.\u201d Working with social insects put Wilson at the heart of the next expansion of understanding in evolutionary biology - social behaviour. Until the 1950s, behaviour had been the preserve of social scientists; most biologists didn\u2019t see it as part of their field. Wilson was given a post-grad student, Stuart Altmann, who was studying the social behaviour of rhesus macaque monkeys. Together, they discussed common themes in social behaviour, Wilson supplying his experience of ants. The tiny insects had evolved to perform tasks in just the right numbers and with just the right adaptations. You could, Wilson and others discovered, formulate mathematical equations which predicted a wide range of behaviour, right down to what Wilson termed \u201cadaptive demography\u201d, altering birth rates to suit the prevailing conditions. Other aspects of ant behaviour could be triggered with the chemical signals that he discovered. By dipping bits of paper in the juice of dead ants, Wilson prompted live ants to carry the paper from their nests, just as they do with the corpses of their sisters. Ant behaviour wasn\u2019t learned, it was instinctive. There were other strands in Wilson\u2019s synthesis, like new ideas on aggression, but the most important was British evolutionary biologist William Hamilton\u2019s explanation of kin selection. Darwin had spotted that ant castes threatened his idea of natural selection; here was a group of animals that apart from the queens didn\u2019t reproduce but worked cooperatively for the good of the colony. How to explain such altruism in Darwinian terms of natural selection? Hamilton\u2019s answer was that siblings will sacrifice themselves for the propagation of the genes they share. The idea had been suggested before, but Hamilton dressed it in calculus and made it demonstrable. The story of how Wilson read Hamilton\u2019s paper on a train journey from Harvard to Florida during which he became converted to Hamilton\u2019s view is scientific folklore. Was he disappointed to have missed such a major piece of the evolutionary puzzle? \u201cAs a researcher in social insects,I should have seen it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s importance was even greater than I originally thought. But I wasn\u2019t really disappointed. By then, I was in the process of synthesising; I wasn\u2019t so much concerned about making individual discoveries. What I was doing was working out the chemical language of ants, and that\u2019s an important part of sociobiology too.\u201d Hamilton is a compelling figure, described by John Maynard Smith as \u201cthe only bloody genius we\u2019ve got\u201d, and Wilson, among others, championed his cause. Self-effacing, but at times almost mystical in his approach to biology, Hamilton died last year, apparently of malaria, after going to the Congo to help research Edward Hooper\u2019s theories about the origins of Aids. Talking about him, Wilson seems almost bereft. Was he surprised by his death? \u201cNot overly surprised, but I was shocked.\u201d Once Wilson would have followed Hamilton into the jungle, now he seems almost angry that his friend is gone. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he was doing a lot of the time, because he didn\u2019t seem to be doing research or getting published. He just loved going to difficult places. I didn\u2019t understand what he was doing in the Congo. He could have handled those questions from a remote distance.\u201d Like Wilson, Hamilton was also attacked - the anthropologist SL Washburn dismissed his ideas on human sociobiology as \u201creductionist, racist and ridiculous\u201d - but Wilson was far more visible, publishing three books in the 1970s on the subject, starting with The Insect Societies in 1971. Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, the title echoing Wilson\u2019s heroes of the 1930s, was published in 1975. Had it dealt only with animals it would have been accepted as a major work with many important ideas crystallised - in 1989, fellows of the Animal Behaviour Society voted it the most influential book on animal behaviour of all time. But by including a final chapter, 30 pages out of almost 600, on the ultimate social animal, homo sapiens, Wilson was lighting the blue touch-paper. Because while the world was content to allow evolution to explain why and how another species is created and how it might behave, the human mind remained off-limits, the preserve of social scientists and theologians, philosophers and novelists. Anyone, it seemed, but biologists. Old scientific controversies are often unpalatable when reheated, but the furore generated by Sociobiology rumbles on. Nor did Wilson duck the opportunity to flag his theories. \u201cLet us now consider man in the free spirit of natural history,\u201d the chapter begins, echoing the Psalms Wilson read as a boy. People are animals, their behaviour has evolved just like that of the animals, and our culture has a biological component, he announced. Human sexuality has evolved in certain ways for specific reasons, all through natural selection. It seemed to some that he was undermining human dignity. Others bristled at an intellectual threat. \u201cTactically he was unwise,\u201d says Richard Dawkins, \u201cbecause it appeared to sociologists and anthropologists that he was empire-building. It sounded threatening, as though here was a biologist trying to move in on their territory. That caused a lot of ruffled feathers which may not have helped matters.\u201d By talking so starkly in terms of the genetic foundation of human behaviour, Wilson offered himself up to more political minds who had much to lose intellectually if his ideas were right. Opposition emerged at several levels, the most conspicuous from radical students who denounced him publicly at his lectures and on campus. At the height of the controversy, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a debate he joined on sociobiology was interrupted by demonstrators who poured a pitcher of water over his head; psychologically bewildering for a gentle man more used to debate than demonstration. But the real opposition to Wilson\u2019s ideas, the attacks that hurt, came from within his own department, from the Marxist biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. The two camps crystallised two views of humanity: the first, that our psychology and social behaviour have evolved along with the rest of us and that every facet of human behaviour, even, say, homosexuality, is influenced by our genetic inheritance; and the second, that the human mind somehow escapes natural selection and answers to another, higher epistemology. Gould and Lewontin believed that \u201cthe purpose of critical science is to promote socialism, which is the only just form of government\u201d, and they saw sociobiology, erroneously as it turns out, as an inherently right-wing, individualistic philosophy. They accused Wilson of sending human nature back to the concentration camps. Wilson isn\u2019t a determinist who believes that life is purely mechanistic, and he isn\u2019t right-wing - he remains a Democrat and fears the environmental worst from the George Bush presidency. Although Wilson argued that homosexuality might have a genetic element, he also argued that it was therefore natural and should be tolerated. But Gould was good-humoured and discursive, taking an apparently compassionate view of human nature, and Lewontin, a population geneticist who could show that racial differences are genetically tiny, added credence to charges of racism, even though Wilson hadn\u2019t brought the subject up. Did he think that his opponents were themselves guilty of prejudice? \u201cThey were, although they never admitted it,\u201d Wilson says slowly, reaching for the words. \u201cI came from the Old South, I was raised as a racist. I mean, we all were. It was only in my teens that I began to change. But here, if you were called racist - well, in the 70s it was like a death sentence.\u201d The wounds from this fight seem fresh even now, probably because, as Dawkins suggests, the assault came from so close to home and without warning: \u201cThey did this thing in print without giving him the slightest inkling what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first Wilson knew about it was when he saw their really very vicious tirade in the New York Review of Books, and I think he felt keenly the discourtesy of them not popping down the hall to talk to him about it.\u201d \u201cThat was excruciating,\u201d Wilson agrees, but if the argument was wearying, Wilson\u2019s intellectual steel glints when he summarises the current position. \u201cI think the sociobiology controversy is essentially over. The contraries are ageing. No young scientists are joining. They are not handing on the torch but passing it around a smaller and smaller circle.\u201d He acknowledges one charge as having validity, the accusation from more thoughtful feminists that he had over-simplified the role of women. \u201cAs time has gone on two things have happened,\u201d he says. \u201cOne is that we are vastly better informed about gender differences, their genetic and physiological bases, right down to fine- tuning of hormonal regulation of behaviour. Another thing is that scientists like Sarah Hardy have been able to demonstrate a far greater richness of female flexibility in reproductive strategies. It\u2019s far more subtle and sophisticated than we anticipated. The theory in the 70s was that women were more passive, judging between male capacities, but now we know that women are vastly more powerful than that in establishing relationships.\u201d With sociobiology prospering, Wilson has carried his research into the full arena of human knowledge, publishing the hugely ambitious Consilience in 1998, in which he developed his ideas about gene-culture co-evolution further and resurrected CP Snow\u2019s efforts to conjoin the \u201ctwo cultures\u201d. In fact, Wilson\u2019s arguments are more fundamental and persuasive than Snow\u2019s; works on evolution, like Sociobiology and Dawkins\u2019s The Selfish Gene, have been absorbed into western cultural life as neatly as any neo-Darwinist could have predicted. \u201cHe is,\u201d says Ian McEwan, \u201ca scientific materialist who warmly embraces the diversity of human achievement - including religion and art, which he sees in evolutionary terms. One of his tasks has been to further the Enlightenment project of absorbing the social sciences into science proper; another has been to find a sound ethical basis for ecological thinking. He is fundamentally a rational optimist who shows us the beauty of the narrative of life on earth. He is living proof that materialism need not be a bleak world view.\u201d",

Explaining his decision, Francis said it was made to give his successor time to plan for next season, the more necessary as 20 players are out of contract in the summer. </p> <p>It had been widely expected that the former England captain would relinquish his duties at the end of this season to devote more time to his family and his antiques business. </p> <p>However, due to QPR's increasingly perilous position at the foot of the First Division, it has been mutually decided to make the change now. Francis's plight has not been helped by a bad run of injuries, including six broken legs and two cruciate ligament injuries, both picked up in the same match. </p> <p>Francis said: \"Our current position is not a particularly pleasant one. But I believe that we can get out of it and be a Division One club next season and, if we can, it will have been 2 years of good work. I hope the new fella, whoever it may be, will have a bit more fortune with these players.\" </p> <p>Ipswich's chairman has criticised the Football Association after it refused to overturn a three-match ban it handed to Marcus Stewart. David Sheepshanks described the decision as \"extraordinary\". </p> <p>\"There is a growing feeling among less fashionable clubs such as ourselves that the lesser stars are being penalised more often and more harshly than big-name superstars,\" he said. </p> <p>Last week Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was handed a one-match ban and a fine after being found guilty of kicking an opponent in the throat. </p> <p>\"After the criticism of FA disciplinary panels last week this decision regarding Marcus Stewart is perhaps not surprising and I'm afraid smacks of political expediency,\" Sheepshanks added. </p> <p>Jaap Stam, 28, has agreed a one-year extension to his deal at Manchester United, which had just over four years to run, and he is now committed until July 2006. United have refused to reveal the Dutchman's new terms but claim they are within their guidelines; in effect his salary has probably doubled. Next up around the negotiating table will be David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. </p> <p>Arsenal are close to extending the deals of Gilles Grimandi and David Seaman for another year, according to Arsene Wenger. The manager took the opportunity to rule the defender Martin Keown out of the England squad to face Spain as he has a knee-ligament problem. </p> <p>David Rocastle, 33 and a former Arsenal midfielder, is suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which attacks the immune system, and is undergoing chemotherapy. He was capped 14 times by England. </p> <p>Peter Reid has joined the clamour for professional referees. \"There's got to be some accountability and maybe professionalism is the way to go,\" the Sunderland manager said. \"If I don't do my job, I get the sack and, if the players aren't performing, they get left out. It's not the same for referees. But then again, why do we have to keep having the same refs? Why not go foreign?\"</p>",

It had been widely expected that the former England captain would relinquish his duties at the end of this season to devote more time to his family and his antiques business. However, due to QPR's increasingly perilous position at the foot of the First Division, it has been mutually decided to make the change now. Francis's plight has not been helped by a bad run of injuries, including six broken legs and two cruciate ligament injuries, both picked up in the same match. Francis said: \"Our current position is not a particularly pleasant one. But I believe that we can get out of it and be a Division One club next season and, if we can, it will have been 2 years of good work. I hope the new fella, whoever it may be, will have a bit more fortune with these players.\" Ipswich's chairman has criticised the Football Association after it refused to overturn a three-match ban it handed to Marcus Stewart. David Sheepshanks described the decision as \"extraordinary\". \"There is a growing feeling among less fashionable clubs such as ourselves that the lesser stars are being penalised more often and more harshly than big-name superstars,\" he said. Last week Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was handed a one-match ban and a fine after being found guilty of kicking an opponent in the throat. \"After the criticism of FA disciplinary panels last week this decision regarding Marcus Stewart is perhaps not surprising and I'm afraid smacks of political expediency,\" Sheepshanks added. Jaap Stam, 28, has agreed a one-year extension to his deal at Manchester United, which had just over four years to run, and he is now committed until July 2006. United have refused to reveal the Dutchman's new terms but claim they are within their guidelines; in effect his salary has probably doubled. Next up around the negotiating table will be David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville. Arsenal are close to extending the deals of Gilles Grimandi and David Seaman for another year, according to Arsene Wenger. The manager took the opportunity to rule the defender Martin Keown out of the England squad to face Spain as he has a knee-ligament problem. David Rocastle, 33 and a former Arsenal midfielder, is suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which attacks the immune system, and is undergoing chemotherapy. He was capped 14 times by England. Peter Reid has joined the clamour for professional referees. \"There's got to be some accountability and maybe professionalism is the way to go,\" the Sunderland manager said. \"If I don't do my job, I get the sack and, if the players aren't performing, they get left out. It's not the same for referees. But then again, why do we have to keep having the same refs? Why not go foreign?\"",

What should concern everyone involved in the protracted wrangle over ending the transfer system is that the talent of future Beckhams might be overlooked in complications which are sure to ensue. With increased player power has to go greater responsibility.",

Six straight clean sheets suggest Arsenal are back in the old routine. And if the old guard of Tony Adams and David Seaman take much credit for that since returning last month, the future looks brighter than ever as well. </p> <p>At left-back Ashley Cole may have played his way into Sven-Goran Eriksson's first England squad, defending with guts and showing his attacking prowess by providing Thierry Henry's winner at Lyon. In the centre Igors Stepanovs has shown increasing assurance as the impossible task of replacing Adams and Martin Keown draws closer. </p> <p>Henry's remarks this week that Arsenal will be \"in trouble\" when Adams retires and that strikers are \"not afraid\" when the influential old warrior is absent are understandable. Since Adams came back four weeks ago the defence has not been breached, a tribute to his form and the way he guides and inspires others. </p> <p>Tomorrow Arsenal must cope without their suspended captain in the FA Cup at home to Chelsea, the last side to score against them 568 minutes ago. Yet before Adams swaps Highbury for Haydn and haikus it seems he will have shaped the next generation. Just ask the 20-year-old Cole. </p> <p>\"It starts in training where he talks to me, then he will chat before the game and also go over things afterwards,\" Cole says. \"His experience has helped me out, particularly with positional play, which is probably the most important thing in games. I used to play left-wing so this is a bit different. I'm getting better but I have a long way to go.\" </p> <p>As courteous and modest off the field as he is fearless on it, Cole seems to have his feet not so much on the ground as nailed to the floor. His mentor George Armstrong, the reserve coach at Highbury whose death late last year deeply hurt him, called him \"Big Time\" when he broke into the first team to prevent him getting carried away. </p> <p>The words and manner of Armstrong, who coached Cole from the age of nine and whose training he enjoyed so much that he would run home from school buzzing at the thought of a session, have left their mark. Much of the country may see Cole as the instant answer to England's left-sided problems but the player himself needs convincing. </p> <p>\"I don't think I deserve to be there at the moment,\" he says. \"I've played five games on the trot and I don't think that's enough experience. At the moment I just want to get in the Arsenal team and establish myself in the Under-21s before I start thinking of the seniors. </p> <p>\"There are left-backs in the Under-21s who I have got to fight for my place with, people like [Chelsea's] Jon Harley, [Charlton's] Paul Konchesky, [Wolves'] Lee Naylor and Wayne Bridge at Southampton. They're all doing well and I have to get in the 21s first.\" </p> <p>Before long, of course, he could be back in the reserves at Highbury. Silvinho should return from injury in around 10 days and Cole, who feels he was toughened up by a loan spell at Crystal Palace last season, still sees himself as the Brazilian's understudy. \"I'm not going to get angry,\" he says, and nor should he because his time will come. </p> <p>Kenny Sansom, who spent eight years occupying that full-back berth at Arsenal, likes what he sees. Some have questioned Cole's defensive capabilities, but Sansom says: \"In the modern game full-backs don't need to do that much defending. It's more of an attacking role these days. </p> <p>\"Ryan Giggs is very exciting when he runs at defenders and Jesper Gronkjaer at Chelsea looks a threat, but when you look at wide players elsewhere there are not many out-and-out wingers. In the 70s there were lots of wingers but now it's more of a wide midfield player.\" </p> <p>Whoever occupies the left-back berth, Arsenal will hope their recent solidity remains. Having let in 43 league goals last season, compared with 17 the previous campaign, and looked vulnerable at times this term, they have planned the training accordingly. Six consecutive clean sheets is the club's best run since 1993-94. </p> <p>The manager knows that ready-made replacements for Adams and Keown are impossible to find and has said he will bring in three or four promising defenders and see who shines. In Matthew Upson, who he signed from Luton in 1997, he may have the answer on his doorstep. </p> <p>The 21-year-old has been cruelly afflicted by injuries and began his latest comeback from a back problem in the reserves in midweek. He hopes the ruptured cruciate ligament he suffered in December 1999 will be a blessing in disguise. \"It's not easy in that gym every day for five months and you really are pulling your hair out,\" he says. \"But I think there is an opportunity here for me and that as long as I can get fit and prove I am good enough I will get a chance.\" </p> <p>Cole, meanwhile, is making his mark.

Logically, since Cardiff City became the only club to take the trophy out of England when they beat Arsenal in Wembley's fifth final, Arsenal should be the first to win it in Wales's first. Failing that, what about Chelsea becoming the first team to retain the Cup in another country? A win for West Ham at the Stadium of Light would further strengthen Upton Park's Cup aspirations and if Tottenham beat Stockport County this afternoon even White Hart Lane might wake up to the prospect of a visit to the Millennium stadium in May.",

You then make one monthly payment which the company distributes, as agreed, between your various creditors. In return for this service, you pay commission of up to 25% which is incorporated into your monthly repayment. </p> <p>But the debt management sector has recently come in for a lot of criticism from consumer groups, free counselling services and lenders who accuse some fee-charging companies of preying on vulnerable people, encouraging them to sign agreements that might not suit their needs, and not being open enough about how they operate and the fees they charge. The government's Debt Task Force, due to report in April on its wide-ranging examination of over-indebtedness, is keen to see tighter controls on this fast-growing and unregulated sector. </p> <p>Sue Edwards, a social policy officer specialising in debt for the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (Nacab) - a member of the Debt Task Force - says Nacab has several concerns about fee-charging debt management companies. </p> <p>\"Some don't properly explain the terms on which you are taken on as a client. They aren't up front about what they charge and they don't, for example, make clear that the first monthly payment you make is a deposit, repayable once you complete the agreement. This means that your payments to creditors are delayed until after the second monthly payment, sometimes even later. Meanwhile, interest and arrears charges are added, increasing your debts and getting you into worse trouble, and you are still getting hassled by letters and calls from creditors.\" </p> <p>Nacab is also seeing evidence of some companies negotiating unrealistically high debt repayments for clients which often break down and of small companies setting up as debt managers and swiftly going bust, taking vulnerable people's money with them. </p> <p>\"In our experience, most fee-charging companies won't negotiate on priority debts such as mortgage and rent arrears and council tax debts, leaving people with little or no advice as to how to deal with them,\" Ms Edwards says. </p> <p>\"They don't, as we do, offer a holistic service that looks at the client's whole financial situation, not just their debts in isolation. We, for example, will make sure that clients are claiming all state benefits they are entitled to and that they deal first with priority debts which, otherwise, could result in their losing the roof over their heads or being taken to court.\" </p> <p>Another worry is that some companies do not make it clear that when you renegotiate debts with creditors, whoever does it, you are defaulting on the terms of the original credit agreement. This fact is registered with credit reference agencies, blighting your credit record and making it difficult for your to get credit for several years afterwards. </p> <p>Ms Edwards says: \"The concern here is that people who can just about afford their debt repayments and don't actually need to reschedule their debts, are persuaded to sign up with debt management companies by adverts offering to substantially reduce their monthly repayments because they like the idea of having some extra cash. They don't realise the impact this will have on their ability to get credit in the future.\" </p> <p>Nacab and other free counselling services do acknowledge, however, that lack of funding means they cannot compete with fee-charging companies in offering a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week service and a debt distribution service. </p> <p>A spokesman for Baines &amp; Ernst, the UK's largest debt management company which advertises on TV frequently, says: \"Many thousands of our clients have come to Baines &amp; Ernst after having failed to resolve their debt problems by using the services of free organisations such as CAB, CCCS and Money Advice Centres. Consumers are often aware of their options but find the services available from the free sector to be limited and unsatisfactory and instead turn to us for a comprehensive and professional service. The free sector means well, but its service is slow and can be at times extremely unhelpful.\" </p> <p>To resolve the situation, Nacab wants to see regulation of the whole sector - free debt advice services included - through the current consumer credit licensing system overseen by the Office of Fair Trading. \"We'd like to see a wider range of enforcement powers for the OFT including the ability to impose fines and force public apologies,\" Ms Edwards says. </p> <p>The proposed regulatory structure would require companies to be transparent about their terms and conditions in their advertising, give clients fuller information on costs, services provided and penalties if they want to stop an agreement, and a cooling-off period. </p> <p>Other critics and members of the Debt Task Force, such as the Finance Leasing Association which represents creditors, are in favour of self-regulation for the industry. </p> <p>This would be welcomed by Baines &amp; Ernst, which claims to adhere to a strict code of practice through its formation and membership of Alda - the Association of Licensed Debt Administrators. Among other things, this code requires terms and conditions to be clear and transparent, and for companies to make consumers aware of the implications of entering into debt management contracts. </p> <p> At present, however, Alda has only two members. A spokesman for Baines &amp; Ernst said: \"Debt management companies provide an invaluable service to thousands of consumers who find them selves heavily in debt. Our average customer has a debt of over \u00a319,000. When people find themselves in this much debt they need help. </p> <p>\"The vast majority of companies in the sector offer a professional service but we are aware of concerns about some isolated incidents.

      "body": "<p>If Leicester-born balladeer James Maddock has anything to do with it, it's only a matter of time before Brit rock's balance of payments deficit with the US is rectified. Having launched his band Wood in 1997, Maddock legged it across the Atlantic, secured a deal with Columbia Records, and managed to sell 40,000 copies of his band's debut album, Songs from Stamford Hill. Perhaps the Americans thought they came from Connecticut. </p> <p>Now they'd like to turn some heads back in their homeland, though the potential market for Wood's agreeable if hardly unique brand of old-fashioned tunesmithery is unlikely to find them packing the Birmingham NEC any time soon. </p> <p>Maddock likes to tip his hat to such stalwarts as Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne, but he might be better advised to keep his mouth shut, since his own songs suffer by comparison. In fact a few spins of the album (due out in the UK in March) tends to prompt comparisons with homegrown acts like the Faces in their folkier moments, or even the Strawbs. </p> <p>Maddock is a sucker for a simple tune and an easy-to-strum chord sequence, but his compositions too often lack those little moments of inspiration which can lift a song from the mundane to the memorable. Having said that, the couplet \"when Harlow Town beat Leicester City your teenage hair turned grey\", from Never Ending, probably deserves an airing on A Question of Sport. </p> <p>Still, Wood's live show is sparkier than their recorded sound. Maddock has a twinkly-eyed cheekiness which he likes to deploy for all it's worth, and does a geezerish line in between-song chat which suggests he's paid his dues in pubs and clubs. Bassist James O'Malley and grizzled-looking drummer Steve Jackson apply some wallop, while Maddock switches nimbly between acoustic and electric guitars. </p> <p>The group whipped up impressive vocal harmonies on the lilting Man On Fire, and Maddock heroically overcame the handicap of having his harmonica in the wrong key on the folk-rockish You Make Me Feel Bad. Their tour de force is Stay You, a Waterboys-ish epic which featured on the Dawson's Creek soundtrack album in the US. It's about to be released as a single here, so all concerned are keeping their fingers crossed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Leicester-born balladeer James Maddock has anything to do with it, it's only a matter of time before Brit rock's balance of payments deficit with the US is rectified. Having launched his band Wood in 1997, Maddock legged it across the Atlantic, secured a deal with Columbia Records, and managed to sell 40,000 copies of his band's debut album, Songs from Stamford Hill. Perhaps the Americans thought they came from Connecticut. Now they'd like to turn some heads back in their homeland, though the potential market for Wood's agreeable if hardly unique brand of old-fashioned tunesmithery is unlikely to find them packing the Birmingham NEC any time soon. Maddock likes to tip his hat to such stalwarts as Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Jackson Browne, but he might be better advised to keep his mouth shut, since his own songs suffer by comparison. In fact a few spins of the album (due out in the UK in March) tends to prompt comparisons with homegrown acts like the Faces in their folkier moments, or even the Strawbs. Maddock is a sucker for a simple tune and an easy-to-strum chord sequence, but his compositions too often lack those little moments of inspiration which can lift a song from the mundane to the memorable. Having said that, the couplet \"when Harlow Town beat Leicester City your teenage hair turned grey\", from Never Ending, probably deserves an airing on A Question of Sport. Still, Wood's live show is sparkier than their recorded sound. Maddock has a twinkly-eyed cheekiness which he likes to deploy for all it's worth, and does a geezerish line in between-song chat which suggests he's paid his dues in pubs and clubs. Bassist James O'Malley and grizzled-looking drummer Steve Jackson apply some wallop, while Maddock switches nimbly between acoustic and electric guitars. The group whipped up impressive vocal harmonies on the lilting Man On Fire, and Maddock heroically overcame the handicap of having his harmonica in the wrong key on the folk-rockish You Make Me Feel Bad. Their tour de force is Stay You, a Waterboys-ish epic which featured on the Dawson's Creek soundtrack album in the US. It's about to be released as a single here, so all concerned are keeping their fingers crossed.",

But, exhilarating as it is to see this seminal work back on a British stage, Richard Jones's ingenious production over-elaborates an already complex work. Stressing its prankishness more than its psychopathology, he turns it at times into an Italian Noises Off. </p> <p>Confrontation lies at the heart of the play. Six characters (refugees from a novel Pirandello never finally wrote) burst into a play rehearsal demanding that an author complete their story, which involves incest, oedipal jealousy and a double suicide. The director and his actors attempt to turn this tragic material into drama, but its painful truth eludes their artifice. The family are trapped for ever in the moment, like the figures on Keats's Grecian urn; the theatre folk, meanwhile, are left facing the insufficiency of their mimetic reality. </p> <p>Part of the play's greatness is that it presents us with an unresolvable conundrum. It pits \"truth\" against illusion, yet even that truth is a Pirandellian invention. It questions the very basis of theatre yet it uses theatre to do it. And, to be fair, both Jones's production and Giles Cadle's outstanding design go some way towards clarifying its paradoxes. </p> <p>The Young Vic itself is turned into an almost parodic version of an Italian proscenium theatre. A prefatory film shows Pirandello abandoning his novel before his six characters burst through a paper screen. And everything is done to highlight the artifice of theatre: the rehearsing actors are all heightened \"types\", performers and characters are separated by divisive footlights, stage trickery is relentlessly exposed. </p> <p>Although David Harrower's new version is faithful to Pirandello, Jones can't resist painting the lily. The key confrontation in the play-within-the-play takes place in a brothel-cum-dress-shop belonging to Madame Pace: here, in a scene of cumulative horror, the father unwittingly makes love to his stepdaughter. But Jones can't resist turning the conjuring up of Madame Pace into a dazzling bit of magic; and, just before the putative seduction, he gets an easy laugh by showing a directorial assistant popping her head up through a prompt box. Satire on theatre takes precedence over Pirandello's enactment of primal Freudian fantasies. </p> <p>Even if the play's psychological pain is muted, Jones gets vivid performances from his actors. Stephen Boxer, guilt-fixated in a creased pinstripe suit, and Leah Muller, provocatively sexy in gymslip and fishnet tights, are very good as the father and stepdaughter. But Jones makes the theatre people the focus of the drama. Darrel D'Silva as the director is a cross between the troupe leader in I Pagliacci and the National Theatre of Brent's Desmond Olivier Dingle, and Catherine Malone as his assistant is the epitome of scuttling officiousness. </p> <p>I still think the family lie at the play's impenetrable heart but, cavil though I may at Jones's reading, no one should miss Pirandello's extraordinary masterpiece. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 17.

Four pieces to encapsulate a career of such distinctive and massive achievement might seem inadequate, but there was the composer's observation in his revealing pre-concert talk: \"When the dust has settled,\" he said, \"you will find that I have only written one piece\". </p> <p>For the more things change in Birtwistle's output, the more they stay the same. He has always started a composition, whether an opera or a solo instrumental work, with the same raw materials - the musical basics of pitch and pulse - and used them to carve new paths through the granitic block of creative material from which everything he has written originates. </p> <p>It might seem as though the seismic convulsions of the 1986 Earth Dances, given a bold, uncompromising performance at the end of this concert, are worlds away from the tightly coiled mechanics of Harrison's Clocks, the ferociously demanding set of piano pieces from 1998, dazzlingly played here by Nicholas Hodges. But there are clockworks whirring away in the orchestral score just as there are tiny kernels of lyricism buried beneath the teeming figuration of the piano-writing; neither could be the work of any other composer. </p> <p>Panic from 1995, the piece with which Birtwistle scandalised the audience at the Last Night of the Proms, certainly shows its kinship with Earth Dances. An in-your-face single movement saxophone concerto, it is as wincingly rebarbative and uncompromising as anything he has written in the last quarter-century, and it still packs a massive punch. In the bright, forward Barbican acoustic, it came over with even more impact than it did in the Albert Hall five and a half years ago, with John Harle's abrasive tone once again aided and abetted by the drum kit of Paul Clarvis, and juxtaposed pitilessly against an orchestra of wind and percussion. </p> <p>Best of all to hear live again was the earliest work in the programme, the absorbing and surpassingly beautiful Melencolia I from 1976, in which a solo clarinet (the assured BBC SO principal Richard Hosford) journeys through a harmonic landscape established by the strings. The clarinet seems to be searching for something that always remains out of reach, so that it never quite manages to express the song that it is desperate to sing.

Lech's range is wide and her timing sharp, so her variation of phrasing against the grooves made the trance-like loop of the music as unpredictable as it could be.

Singer Beate Lech and bassist Marius Reksjo (collectively they're Beady Belle) wound up the show with a blend of drum'n'bass and powerful, pop-soul vocals. Lech's range is wide and her timing sharp, so her variation of phrasing against the grooves made the trance-like loop of the music as unpredictable as it could be. Maybe that isn't saying all that much, but the Oslo underground certainly has energy and a fresh angle on crossover on its side. Its influence is bound to grow.",
