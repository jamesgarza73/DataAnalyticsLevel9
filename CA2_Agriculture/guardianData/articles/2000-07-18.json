      "body": "<p>I am quite pleased not to be meeting Rob Smith. He says he's too busy doing his job to take time out to tell me about it in person but has agreed to chat on the phone. Phew, I thought, actually quite relieved we weren't going to come face to face. It's not that I don't like Smith. On the contrary, in the conversations we've had he was a very cheerful, friendly, pleasant kind of guy. But here's the thing ... I think he might smell. </p> <p>Smith's job is to \"keep on top of what's underground\", which is the polite way of saying he works in the sewers. Actually, the really polite term is \"catchment support engineer\", which probably goes down better at parties as well. In a society where people increasingly define you by your profession, it must be hard, I imagine, to have a job with the popular appeal of an evening with Enoch Powell. </p> <p>Not at all, corrects Smith. \"A lot of people find sewers very interesting. There was a point when so many people wanted to come down it was impinging on the day job.\" I stand corrected. But who? Architects, he tells me, are the most enthusiastic. Apparently, the Victorian brick-work in the Thames sewers is quite alluring. \"The construction is unique. The workmanship is superb,\" he enthuses. \"It's beautiful for people who appreciate that sort of thing. I have the pleasure to work in the modern-day sewers, which are pretty fantastic, but it's the older ones that are magnificent.\" </p> <p>Fantastic. Pleasurable. Magnificent. Not the sort of adjectives you'd expect to hear from a sewage worker, but it's how Smith chooses to define his work. \"I thoroughly enjoy my job. There are times when the phone call comes and it's an emergency and you're really in the thick of it. I was in charge of the Leicester Square fat problem,\" he boasts, assuming I already know about the sewage crisis that resulted from too many fast food outlets pouring their fat down the sink. \"It was a 4ft solid egg shape of fat. Totally blocked. I get those sort of projects, the interesting ones - or, I guess, the ones which no one else wants.\" </p> <p>Claudine Lashley knows all about projects that no one else wants - she's been working for the Inland Revenue for 20 years. When she started as a lowly revenue assistant, it didn't matter who she was working for, she just told people she was in a clerical position. And when promotion came three years later she was happy - but left out the bit about being a tax officer when people asked. \"Working in the tax office\" or \"for the Inland Revenue\" or, if she was feeling coy, saying she worked \"in the Civil Service\" always seemed to go down so much better. Of course, when she became a fully-fledged tax investigator she just gave up lying altogether. </p> <p>\"When you're introduced to people for the first time there's that step-back reaction,\" she says. \"Not in an aggressive way, but people are definitely surprised. A female is not most people's image of what a tax investigator looks like. I mean, we've got Hector the Inspector on our ad campaign at the moment and I think that's what most people expect us to look like.\" </p> <p>It's what comes after \"that step-back reaction\" that amuses Lashley. \"It's actually quite like being a doctor because when I walk into the room, once people have absorbed what I do, they start to realise that I can be quite useful. Then come all the questions about their tax bill or about their friend's tax bill. I'm quite a handy person to know.\" </p> <p>It's this \"handy\" notion of tax people that the Inland Revenue are desperate to promote. Saddled with a bad image, Claudine describes how they are at great pains to undergo a makeover. \"We don't call them tax investigations any more,\" she tells me, \"they are inquiries. And we don't assume that people's tax information is wrong, we're just checking it's correct.\" And what are the humble taxpayers now known as in the Inland Revenue office? \"Customers,\" she says, with a slight snigger. </p> <p>It's for that reason Lashley maintains she too loves her job. \"A lot of people think that working for the Revenue means a lot of confrontation, but generally when people deal with the Revenue it's because they need help and that's what I'm doing - giving them help.\" </p> <p>Olwyn Burgess, a principal consultant at TMP Worldwide, which specialises in career management and training, says a positive approach to these allegedly unpopular jobs is not uncommon. \"It's very much a question of personal interest.

      "bodyText": "I am quite pleased not to be meeting Rob Smith. He says he's too busy doing his job to take time out to tell me about it in person but has agreed to chat on the phone. Phew, I thought, actually quite relieved we weren't going to come face to face. It's not that I don't like Smith. On the contrary, in the conversations we've had he was a very cheerful, friendly, pleasant kind of guy. But here's the thing ... I think he might smell. Smith's job is to \"keep on top of what's underground\", which is the polite way of saying he works in the sewers. Actually, the really polite term is \"catchment support engineer\", which probably goes down better at parties as well. In a society where people increasingly define you by your profession, it must be hard, I imagine, to have a job with the popular appeal of an evening with Enoch Powell. Not at all, corrects Smith. \"A lot of people find sewers very interesting. There was a point when so many people wanted to come down it was impinging on the day job.\" I stand corrected. But who? Architects, he tells me, are the most enthusiastic. Apparently, the Victorian brick-work in the Thames sewers is quite alluring. \"The construction is unique. The workmanship is superb,\" he enthuses. \"It's beautiful for people who appreciate that sort of thing. I have the pleasure to work in the modern-day sewers, which are pretty fantastic, but it's the older ones that are magnificent.\" Fantastic. Pleasurable. Magnificent. Not the sort of adjectives you'd expect to hear from a sewage worker, but it's how Smith chooses to define his work. \"I thoroughly enjoy my job. There are times when the phone call comes and it's an emergency and you're really in the thick of it. I was in charge of the Leicester Square fat problem,\" he boasts, assuming I already know about the sewage crisis that resulted from too many fast food outlets pouring their fat down the sink. \"It was a 4ft solid egg shape of fat. Totally blocked. I get those sort of projects, the interesting ones - or, I guess, the ones which no one else wants.\" Claudine Lashley knows all about projects that no one else wants - she's been working for the Inland Revenue for 20 years. When she started as a lowly revenue assistant, it didn't matter who she was working for, she just told people she was in a clerical position. And when promotion came three years later she was happy - but left out the bit about being a tax officer when people asked. \"Working in the tax office\" or \"for the Inland Revenue\" or, if she was feeling coy, saying she worked \"in the Civil Service\" always seemed to go down so much better. Of course, when she became a fully-fledged tax investigator she just gave up lying altogether. \"When you're introduced to people for the first time there's that step-back reaction,\" she says. \"Not in an aggressive way, but people are definitely surprised. A female is not most people's image of what a tax investigator looks like. I mean, we've got Hector the Inspector on our ad campaign at the moment and I think that's what most people expect us to look like.\" It's what comes after \"that step-back reaction\" that amuses Lashley. \"It's actually quite like being a doctor because when I walk into the room, once people have absorbed what I do, they start to realise that I can be quite useful. Then come all the questions about their tax bill or about their friend's tax bill. I'm quite a handy person to know.\" It's this \"handy\" notion of tax people that the Inland Revenue are desperate to promote. Saddled with a bad image, Claudine describes how they are at great pains to undergo a makeover. \"We don't call them tax investigations any more,\" she tells me, \"they are inquiries. And we don't assume that people's tax information is wrong, we're just checking it's correct.\" And what are the humble taxpayers now known as in the Inland Revenue office? \"Customers,\" she says, with a slight snigger. It's for that reason Lashley maintains she too loves her job. \"A lot of people think that working for the Revenue means a lot of confrontation, but generally when people deal with the Revenue it's because they need help and that's what I'm doing - giving them help.\" Olwyn Burgess, a principal consultant at TMP Worldwide, which specialises in career management and training, says a positive approach to these allegedly unpopular jobs is not uncommon. \"It's very much a question of personal interest. I made a conscious decision about going into career management and outplacement, a lot of which involves advising people who have been made redundant. When I tell people this they always say 'God, how depressing', but actually it's a very rewarding job.\" She argues that few people actually understand what is involved with other people's work and their motives for doing it. \"We might label a traffic warden as a Little Hitler, but in actual fact they are doing something for the community and stopping people parking where, for safety and legal reasons, they shouldn't. Now, if you've got a strong sense of what is right and wrong it's the perfect job for you. \"I also had a friend who worked as an undertaker, which sounds awful but it suited him perfectly because he was a very serious person,\" she says. \"So people stumble into professions that suit their personality and their preferences.\" Burgess suggests that it also boils down to the old \"Do you work to live or live to work?\" adage.

      "bodyText": "Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss-American investment bank, is planning to launch a new online private banking service targeted at the rapidly-expanding numbers of high earners in the US. The new service, known in the bank as \"privateadvisor.com\", is expected to compete with a $1bn venture between Merrill Lynch and HSBC, which also hopes to attract cash from the newly affluent. The Merrill/HSBC company, based in London, will target those with \"investable assets\" of \u00a360,000-\u00a3300,000 who are keen to make their own investment decisions. CSFB's privateadvisor.com is expected to go after the same market and will be headed by Kevin English - the former chief executive of news website Thestreet.com. Mr English joined CSFB's e-commerce department earlier this year and is expected to hire significant numbers of people - one insider said \"several hundred people\" were required - for the new service. Mr English was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for the group also refused to comment on its online ambitions yesterday, saying it would be \"premature to discuss\" the new service. Insiders say that privateadvisor.com will initially start in the US before it is launched in other parts of the world, such as Europe. It is expected to be branded as a CSFB product. The bank's top management is expected to move swiftly into cyberspace - which sources say has been triggered by the rising number of users of its websites. By the end of February, the number of CSFB's online banking customers had reached 200,000. CSFB executives are keen to combine the web's low cost with the high margins generated by well-heeled investors. Most traditional private banking services target the extremely wealthy - defined as individuals with investable assets of more than $1m - and offer bespoke investment plans. In recent years, the growing ranks of individuals with at least $100,000 to play the markets with, has attracted the big banks. These customers, say the banks, neither need nor want the sort of personal attention provided by a traditional private bank. Studies by Gemini Consulting and Merrill Lynch suggest that private banking assets could rise above $38,000bn by 2005 largely because of the increasing wealth of this band of people. Michael Maslinski, director of a management consultancy which specialises in private banking, has estimated that the richest 5% of people in the US, which includes those targeted by CSFB and its rivals, provide about half of the profits earned in the retail financial services sector. \"Private banking is not a niche any more - it's big business.\" he says. The private banking operation of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, which has SFr600bn (\u00a3243bn)in assets under management, also plans to launch a European e-commerce operation in the third quarter. The new \"ebank\" is part of CSFB's global strategy. Experts say that across Europe, the Far East, Japan and Latin America, the number of households on the net that are also active investors is expected to grow more than fourfold in the next decade to 50m. In Europe alone, the number of online banking and investment accounts is predicted to exceed 14m by 2004.",

But when officials from Croydon Women's Football Club met with their team for the annual general meeting it was extinction and not success that dominated the agenda. In an astonishing move, members of Britain's most successful women's team voted in favour of their own takeover, shocking the chairman and committee members. The Croydon players decided to move en masse across south London and will now be known as Charlton Athletic Women's Football Club after electing to be taken over by the Premier League club. Despite opposition from the club chairman Ken Jarvie and others, they made their historic decision at a fiery meeting, claiming that the move would be better for their development as footballers. From now on the team will play as Charlton Athletic, in a move backed by the Football Association. Croydon have become one of Britain's better known women's teams and their press officer Donald Madgwick said yesterday that few had expected the club to vote itself into extinction. \"It was discussed right at the end of the meeting, under the section headlined any other business,\" he said. \"This can't be fair.

He has left it as a serious parliamentary force for the first time in its history. Under Alex Salmond it has become the principal opposition party in Scotland. It is a very substantial legacy. He has made the SNP a force in politics.\" In the first year of the new Scottish parliament the SNP has flourished in the polls, currently sitting three points ahead of Labour in Scotland on 36%. But there has been dissent in the party at Mr Salmond's leadership style and his often lacklustre performance at question time. There has also been a series of internal crises, including the suspension of the party treasurer, Ian Blackford, who threatened to sue Mr Salmond. Alex Salmond joined the SNP in 1973 and took over as leader in 1990. An economist, he previously worked with the old Scottish Office and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Last night he insisted his departure was purely based on a desire to hand on the reins when the party was doing well. But one nationalist MSP said: \"I am not surprised he is stepping down - he has stepped back a lot since the election, and it appears to me that there was a deliberate move to promote others, to demolish the idea that we are a one-man band.\" Christine Grahame added: \"I don't think he has the same appetite for the job. Everyone detected that. I have done a job myself for 12 years and you get a bit battle-weary.\"",

Her boyfriend, Marcus Trescothick, has suddenly become the talk of the town - the new saviour of English cricket. His weakness outside off stump, his penchant for sausages and his powerful hitting have become topics for national discussion. But Hayley seems nearly as relaxed about it as her nonchalant boyfriend.</p> <p>\"Not much has changed for me, though I haven't seen Marcus since last Tuesday and it has been completely manic for him - lots of press and TV. I've spoken to him every day and he's taking it very well. He's the sort of guy who doesn't let things get to him. He's pretty relaxed which annoys me sometimes! It's always been his ambition to play Test cricket and he was so pleased to be picked for the one-day squad. I'm just glad he wasn't driving anywhere when he found out he'd been selected - he was so excited.\"</p> <p>They met at a nightclub on Hayley's 19th birthday, four years ago last Tuesday. \"I didn't recognise him but we just got chatting. I followed Somerset so when he said his name I said: 'Oh you're that cricketer who did well in such and such a year.' He is quite a shy type of guy and was a bit embarrassed, but we just laugh about it now.\" </p> <p>In January they moved into a place in Taunton, where Marcus shows surprising skill in the kitchen for someone nicknamed Banger. \"He is a great cook, and does most of our cooking. He will always do it if we have friends round to dinner - he knocks up a very good stir-fry. He does eat sausages but very, very rarely. He tends to eat healthily and hardly ever has fatty foods (though I'm just the opposite and love a McDonalds). I very rarely see him with a chocolate bar in his hand.\"</p> <p>Hayley has been with him through leaner years than this one, when Trescothick, Mark Lathwell and underachievement were constantly mentioned in the same breath. Did he ever lose confidence? \"No, he's still fairly young and he has always been positive. He spent two winters away in Australia working on his fitness and his game, and he has always had a positive attitude.\" </p> <p>What they don't do is sit around discussing whether Andy Caddick bowls too short. \"We try not to talk about cricket too much because it is his work - I don't like talking about my job either [she is a secretary for a building company in Taunton].\" </p> <p>What does she feel like while watching him bat? \"I just sit there in complete agony and feel physically sick, though I'm not quite so bad now. But I was very, very nervous when he walked out in his first game for England. I cried, in fact. He couldn't see us in the crowd which was probably a good thing.\" </p> <p>Going out with a county cricketer can seem like a bit of a thankless task. They work long hours, are away every other week during the nicest part of the year, and are then all over you like a rash in the winter. Hayley admits that it is hard but says, \"you do get used to it and it helps that all the [Somerset] wives and girlfriends are really good friends. When the players go away we all get together and take it in turns going round each other's houses, and we also have girlie nights out. And if we do decide to go and watch an away game, we all go together.\"</p> <p>They don't just play together in the evenings, they make up a pretty good cricket side. \"Andy Caddick's wife played a few games till she had a baby, and so did Bethan Shine [Kevin Shine's wife]. Then there is Lucy Turner [Rob Turner's wife] and Jamie Cox's girlfriend, Helen, and me. Although my brother and father played, and I spent my childhood chucking balls at my brother in the back garden, I only really got interested in playing properly when I met Marcus and the other girlfriends. I gave up playing for Somerset this year but I am still an allrounder for Taunton ladies.\" </p> <p>Though handy in the kitchen Marcus isn't a completely new man. \"When I first started playing he used to take the mick out of me - although now he's very supportive. In my first year he took me up to the nets at Taunton to show me how to bat properly but of course I was having none of it.\"</p> <p>Quite right.

Then there is Lucy Turner [Rob Turner's wife] and Jamie Cox's girlfriend, Helen, and me. Although my brother and father played, and I spent my childhood chucking balls at my brother in the back garden, I only really got interested in playing properly when I met Marcus and the other girlfriends. I gave up playing for Somerset this year but I am still an allrounder for Taunton ladies.\" Though handy in the kitchen Marcus isn't a completely new man. \"When I first started playing he used to take the mick out of me - although now he's very supportive. In my first year he took me up to the nets at Taunton to show me how to bat properly but of course I was having none of it.\" Quite right. Women always know best.

But he still risks public cynicism about the large figures until voters see the results in schools, hospitals and transport.</p> <p>Today's package will be largely financed by the adoption of tight Tory spending curbs and tax hikes during Mr Blair's early years, Labour shifting from a spend-and-tax party into a tax-and-spend government.</p> <p>With unemployment at a 20-year low, billions of pounds has been \"saved\", social security spending rising 1.5% a year in this parliament compared with 4% during the final Conservative years.</p> <p>The chancellor has also gambled on no recession or serious economic downturn by loosening the purse strings ahead of the election to create clear blue water between Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, suggested that Mr Brown's \"spending splurge\" could turn out to be phoney, but he refused to commit the Conservatives to adopting them, leaving Mr Brown to claim the opposition offered a \"Tory spending cut guarantee\".</p> <p>Mr Brown painted a glowing picture of public finances as overall spending grows to \u00a3212bn in 2001-02, \u00a3229bn in 2002-2003 before reaching \u00a3246bn after a series of above inflation awards to produce real improvements.</p> <p>Mr Brown said the \u00a328bn budget deficit inherited from the Tories has been \"eliminated\" and transformed into a current surplus of \u00a320.4bn - more than the \u00a317.1bn forecast in the budget earlier this year.</p> <p>Healthy public finances had allowed him to repay a postwar record \u00a318.1bn off the national debt last year and his plans show a further \u00a329bn surplus over the three years.</p> <p>Investment in public infrastructure, including buildings and roads, is at a 35-year low, and Mr Brown said it would virtually double to \u00a318bn by the end of the period. The \u00a322bn sale of new generation mobile phone licences, said Mr Brown, would reduce the national debt - unlike North Sea oil revenue which, he said, was \"frittered away\" under the Tories.</p> <p>Whitehall departments and other public bodies will also raise \u00a34bn a year by selling uneeded land, buildings and equipment.</p> <p>The New Deal, initially introduced to help unemployed youngsters into work, is to be made permanent and a \u00a3134m rise to \u00a3200m in childcare spending will help parents take jobs.</p>",

Senior ministers are to make a series of detailed announcements over the next two weeks in an attempt to create a bandwagon to take the government through the summer and into an election expected next spring. In a 40-minute speech, Mr Brown told a packed House of Commons that he wanted to create a \"Britain of security and opportunity for all\" in the teeth of Tory claims that he was funding the package by backdoor taxes. A \u00a313bn rise for the NHS was announced in last spring's budget, and the chancellor maintained the three-year spending spree was made possible by the government's prudence of the last three years. Mr Brown resisted the temptation to double and triple-count increases - avoiding the mistakes of two years ago, when a \u00a340bn boost to health and education turned out to be worth less than a third of that total. The same trick today would have produced unbelieved claims of an \u00a380bn bonanza. But he still risks public cynicism about the large figures until voters see the results in schools, hospitals and transport. Today's package will be largely financed by the adoption of tight Tory spending curbs and tax hikes during Mr Blair's early years, Labour shifting from a spend-and-tax party into a tax-and-spend government. With unemployment at a 20-year low, billions of pounds has been \"saved\", social security spending rising 1.5% a year in this parliament compared with 4% during the final Conservative years. The chancellor has also gambled on no recession or serious economic downturn by loosening the purse strings ahead of the election to create clear blue water between Labour and the Tories. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, suggested that Mr Brown's \"spending splurge\" could turn out to be phoney, but he refused to commit the Conservatives to adopting them, leaving Mr Brown to claim the opposition offered a \"Tory spending cut guarantee\". Mr Brown painted a glowing picture of public finances as overall spending grows to \u00a3212bn in 2001-02, \u00a3229bn in 2002-2003 before reaching \u00a3246bn after a series of above inflation awards to produce real improvements. Mr Brown said the \u00a328bn budget deficit inherited from the Tories has been \"eliminated\" and transformed into a current surplus of \u00a320.4bn - more than the \u00a317.1bn forecast in the budget earlier this year. Healthy public finances had allowed him to repay a postwar record \u00a318.1bn off the national debt last year and his plans show a further \u00a329bn surplus over the three years. Investment in public infrastructure, including buildings and roads, is at a 35-year low, and Mr Brown said it would virtually double to \u00a318bn by the end of the period. The \u00a322bn sale of new generation mobile phone licences, said Mr Brown, would reduce the national debt - unlike North Sea oil revenue which, he said, was \"frittered away\" under the Tories. Whitehall departments and other public bodies will also raise \u00a34bn a year by selling uneeded land, buildings and equipment. The New Deal, initially introduced to help unemployed youngsters into work, is to be made permanent and a \u00a3134m rise to \u00a3200m in childcare spending will help parents take jobs.",

      "body": "<b>Transport</b> <br> A few months ago transport was tipped to lose out on the cash bonanza. But today rising popular concern about clogged roads and poor public transport led the chancellor to announce a \"step change\" in its funding, in the single most dramatic announcement among a profusion of real-term increases. <p>John Prescott's giant Department of the Environment was awarded a massive increase in funding of 20% a year in real terms, from \u00a34.9bn this year to \u00a36bn in 2001, \u00a37.4bn in 2002 and \u00a39.1bn in 2003-4. Deputy prime minister John Prescott will set out the spending plans in his forthcoming 10-year plan for transport. While he will seek to placate the roads lobby, railways and urban light-rail systems will be a priority. Voters want immediate improvements, but it will be years before they feel the impact of the rebuilding.</p> <p><b>Education</b><br> Described as \"the great driver of prosperity and skills\" by the chancellor, education has done very well out of the spending review: Schools, colleges and universities will share almost an extra \u00a312bn over the period 2001-2 to 2003-4. A typical English secondary school will see its direct funding rise from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 in 2001-2, the chancellor told MPs. Primary schools will also get more, with funding for a typical junior school jumping from \u00a39,000 to \u00a312,000 in the same period. Funding per pupil will have risen by over \u00a3300 per pupil in real terms since 1997. By 2003-4, funding per pupil will be \u00a3700 higher than it was during Labour's first year in office.</p> <p>The chancellor is hoping that this additional cash will boost the performance of Britain's under-achieving secondary schools, particularly in deprived areas. Skills, adult literacy and university access are issues which interest him, and they have done well. Higher education will receive an extra \u00a3100m in 2001-2 on top of the \u00a3295m announced earlier in the year. Further education will get \u00a350m to extend the controversial performance-related pay scheme, which has recently been blocked by the courts. The decision to give \u00a3540m to head teachers to spend as they wish next year is noteworthy: new Labour is steering clear of its \"control freak\" tag.</p> <p><b>Crime</b><br> The Home Office has won an annual rise from 2001-2004 averaging 6.4% a year in real terms. The chancellor signalled that new spending plans outlined by the home secretary, Jack Straw, next week would unveil a big increase in frontline policing, particularly welcome after today's crime figures showed a 3.8% increase in reported crime in England and Wales in the 12 months to March. As well as appealing to Middle England's desire to get tough on crime, the chancellor bid for the liberal vote, pledging money to cut drug-related reoffending and to double the number of addicts treated at national centres.</p> <p><b>Welfare</b><br> The chancellor's attachment to the government's New Deal is well known. Announcing today's spending plans, Gordon Brown spoke of transforming what started out as a new deal for the young unemployed into \"a permanent deal for long-term unemployed\". \u00a31.7bn from the windfall levy next year and every year until 2003 will help apply the welfare-to-work scheme to the older unemployed, in particular those skill-starved middle-aged jobless. The chancellor also offered a boost for the government's new national childcare strategy. Increasing funding from \u00a366m to \u00a3200m by 2003-4 will aim to open up working opportunities to more mothers. All this is aided by savings which the chancellor said were \"in excess of \u00a31bn\" in the welfare budget, coming from cut-backs on benefit fraud and getting more people into work.</p> <p><b>Defence</b><br> Gordon Brown's first spending announcement was on defence, reflecting the concerns in Tony Blair's leaked memo that the government was seen as \"soft\" on issues of national and international security. The chancellor announced a startling reversal of the steady fall in defence spending: with \u00a323.6bn next year, rising to \u00a325bn in 2003-4, it will increase in real terms for the first time since the end of the cold war, more than a decade ago. The increase is also a reaction to military fears of overstretch as a result Britain's involvement in peacekeeping missions around the world.</p> <p><b>Health</b><br> Details have been known about one of the big winners from the spending review since March, when the chancellor used the budget to unveil a \u00a313bn increase in health spending in real terms over three years. By 2003-4 it will have grown by 6.1% - double the historic trend since the NHS was set up in 1948.</p> <p>Gordon Brown did not announce any alterations to this today and full details of the government's plans for the NHS will only become clear when Tony Blair announces a 10-year plan for the NHS next week.

Today Gordon Brown has announced an increase in funding for a new small business service, from \u00a3197m this year to \u00a3277m by 2004. A key part of this will be a national internet service providing small business advice. Information technology will also be boosted by the government's pledge to offer all its services - from benefits to passports - online by 2005. Tony Blair will announce a new fund for this initiative this summer.</p> <p><b>Regional Development</b><br> Another big success for John Prescott was the chancellor's promise of \"match funding\" for objective one, two and three areas supported by EU structural and social funds.

The seven studios, Universal Pictures, Walt Disney, Fox, Paramount, MGM, Time Warner and Sony Entertainment, want to stop Eric Corley from marketing the DVD codebreaker - known as DeCSS- available through his <a href=\"http://www.2600.com/\" target=\"_new\">2600.com</a> website, which is an online version of his magazine, 2600: The Hacker Quarterly.</p> <p>The software makes it possible for computer users to copy full-length feature films from DVDs on to their own computer hard drives or CD ROMS. Lawyer Leon P Gold, who represents the studios, said: \"This case relates to the protection of artistic works and to the health of the American motion picture industry\". The courtroom was shown scenes from movies including Sleepless in Seattle and The Matrix (pictured) which had been downloaded onto a hard disk.</p> <p>The studios are seeking to put an end to Corley's DeCSS web postings, and want compensation for profits lost due to DeCSS downloads so far. Corley's lawyers are citing the First Amendment, which they believe protect their clients' rights to provide the software to the public. </p> <p>Meanwhile Eric Corley has become something of a hero among his fellow hackers for standing up to the hugely powerful motion picture industry, despite their winning a preliminary injunction in January forcing his site to remove the DeCSS code from the Web. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal yesterday also published the internet addresses of several sites that offer software permitting high-quality, full-screen videos to be downloaded from the internet relatively quickly. \"Hollywood, your nightmare is here,\" the newspaper commented. </p> <p>The technology is apparently based on software developed by Microsoft and distributed to software developers. It significantly reduces the size of a file for an average-length movie without significant loss of quality from five gigabytes to 650 megabytes, which can be easily stored on a conventional CD. </p> <p>The case is expected to continue for a further two weeks.</p>",

Corley's lawyers are citing the First Amendment, which they believe protect their clients' rights to provide the software to the public. Meanwhile Eric Corley has become something of a hero among his fellow hackers for standing up to the hugely powerful motion picture industry, despite their winning a preliminary injunction in January forcing his site to remove the DeCSS code from the Web. The Wall Street Journal yesterday also published the internet addresses of several sites that offer software permitting high-quality, full-screen videos to be downloaded from the internet relatively quickly. \"Hollywood, your nightmare is here,\" the newspaper commented. The technology is apparently based on software developed by Microsoft and distributed to software developers. It significantly reduces the size of a file for an average-length movie without significant loss of quality from five gigabytes to 650 megabytes, which can be easily stored on a conventional CD. The case is expected to continue for a further two weeks.",

      "bodyText": "1. Big Brother, a worldwide \"social experiment\" and slice-of-life TV starts on Channel 4 tonight. 2. In the show, 10 strangers live for nine weeks in one house with 24 cameras and no privacy. Viewers vote for one inmate to be kicked out each week and the winner pockets \u00a370,000. 3. From its origins in Holland the format has spread to Germany and the US and poppped up as Gran Hermano in Spain. 4. Big Brother attracts controversy: Germany's interior minister called on viewers to boycott the show if they \"still cherish feeling for human dignity\". 5. And in the US, CBS is accused of failing to properly vet its inmates after the New York Daily News revealed that one contestant, William Collins, was an aide to the anti-semitic (and expelled) former leader of Nation of Islam, Khalid Abdul Muhammad. 6. George, a 41-year-old family man who ranks The Blues Brothers as his favourite movie, has a little secret too. He accidentally shot and killed a close friend during a hunting trip 12 years ago. 7. But bigger problems may lie with the show's plummeting ratings. During Sunday lunch, engineering student Josh wondered aloud what would happen to the inmates if CBS prematurely pulled the plug. 8. Back in Britain, Channel 4's choices seem safer. Some 40,000 applied to take part in the British version, which is being made by Bazal productions, part-owned by the Guardian Media Group. Anna, a 29-year-old former nun, who loves anything written by Bill Bryson, is favourite to be last contender standing. 9. The conditions are tough. Personal possessions (such as pens) are banned and toiletries must be bought from a small weekly grocery budget. 10. Getting down to what most viewers (and TV executives) are most interested in, Flutter.com is offering person-to-person wagers on who will sleep with who. And when.",

      "body": "<p>If you go down to the millennium bridge in London, after midnight, when the workmen are gone and the buildings around are silent and darkened, you may notice something surprising. At the south end, behind the builders' hoardings, a solitary security guard sits in a steamed-up Portakabin. He'll be there for as long as it takes the bridge's wobbles to be cured. At the north end there are some temporary gates, locked but not that tall, a piece of paper pinned up reading \"Bridge Closed\", the pins already old-looking and rusted, and a single word of graffiti: \"Why?\". </p> <p>And beyond the gates, out over the black Thames, between the swooping, lit-up handrails of Britain's most currently infamous architectural experiment, there may be silhouettes moving about - illicit visitors: curious people testing the decking, couples smoking cigarettes in midstream, people just marvelling at the views and taut steel. \"You feel suspended in space above the river,\" says one. \"It was a sublime experience.\" After watching the moon and the skyline for a while, he walked back towards the riverbank: \"I saw another dozen people climbing up.\" </p> <p>Even by British standards, the bridge has become an ambiguous piece of modern architecture. It has been shut for more than a month, ever since 200,000 people - about five times the number expected - turned up on its opening weekend. A campaign to re-open it, before the vibrations are even dampened, is gaining momentum in the London Evening Standard. </p> <p>In some ways, this slim, silvery span and the appetite for using it seem to demonstrate a new national confidence in all things hi-tech and streamlined. Ever since its construction was announced five years ago, the bridge has been talked about excitedly in science fiction terms: a \"blade of light\", a \"magic carpet\", an \"absolute statement\", in the words of its designers Foster and Partners, \"of our capabilities at the beginning of the 21st century\". </p> <p>New bridges in general, after decades as unloved and ugly projects, are back in fashion. There are plans for more in London. There are millennium crossings underway or recently completed in York, Peterborough, Tyneside and County Fermanagh. These arcs of glass and aluminium seem to offer spectacle and usefulness, opportunities for regeneration and property development, publicity for their surrounding areas - the perfect combination, it appears, for the contemporary urban planner. Mark Whitby, a bridge engineer with three British projects on the go, says local councils now tend to choose the \"most adventurous\" design on offer. </p> <p>But what if it wobbles? When the millennium bridge's wide deck began to buck and sway, all this adventure suddenly looked slightly reckless. Aesthetics - one of the bridge's engineers approvingly described its design as \"emotional not rational\" - seemed to have overwhelmed practicality. And as identifying the precise problem, and its origin, and how to solve it, has lengthened the likely closure from \"a few weeks\" to \"a few months\" to \"a matter of months - hopefully\", so the structure has started to become a British symbol of a more traditional sort: a big project running late. </p> <p>At first, official statements about the bridge, like an an untrustworthy station announcer's, see-sawed between evasion, over-confidence, and sulkiness. It was the pedestrians' fault. Or it was strictly the bridge engineers' (Foster and Partners remain keen to redirect press enquiries to Ove Arup). Or there was no problem at all, just a national suspicion of \"ambition\". Lately, the PR line has softened: \"The swaying is bridge-induced, not pedestrian- induced,\" admits Tony Fitzpatrick, Arup's bridge overseer. He says that a solution - flexible shock absorbers fixed along the underside - is currently being discussed with the relevant manufacturers. But the anxiety set off by the bridge, and the over-budget Jubilee Line, and the late-starting millennium wheel, and the deflating Millennium Dome, and the builder-blighted quality of British cities in general, remains. Must building ambitiously in Britain always be such a struggle? </p> <p>According to the official history of the millennium bridge project, the publication of which has also been delayed, a crossing between Southwark and St Paul's Cathedral was first suggested in 1851. It took another 60 years before an Act of Parliament was passed to authorise it, and another three were spent discussing whether the bridge should be positioned to create a new tram route or give the best possible view of St Paul's. Finally, in 1914, a florid classical design was chosen which included \"a winged goddess driving a two-horse chariot\". Then the first world war broke out. </p> <p>The idea of a link between the prosperous City and poor south London gradually faded, as idealistic schemes for the capital tend to. It took the re-awakening of interest in grand architectural gestures along the Thames during the 90s to revive the bridge-building notion. David Bell, now chairman of the Millennium Bridge Trust, was working for the Financial Times in Southwark: \"My office overlooked the river. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be fantastic to build a bridge from St Paul's to the Bankside power station?'\" </p> <p>Bankside was already marked for conversion into the Tate Modern. Southwark council was keen to make a cultural quarter out of its concrete flatlands. Tourism on both riverbanks would clearly benefit. But Bell was quickly made aware that such arguments might not be sufficient. \"Everybody said, 'You'll never get permission.'\" </p> <p>He decided to use publicity as a weapon. In 1996, the Financial Times sponsored a public competition asking architects, engineers and artists to devise a crossing. More than 200 designs were submitted; one of them was from Foster and Partners, Ove Arup, and the veteran British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro. Precisely which of them initiated this collaboration is now a matter of polite jockeying. Caro says he called Foster. Ken Shuttleworth, the Foster partner in charge of the bridge, says they were thinking about entering anyway. Chris Wise, the Arup engineer most involved early on, has now left the company and communicates via cryptic phone messages. </p> <p>What seems fairly certain is that, one evening that summer, Wise and a fellow Arup engineer, having agreed to meet Foster and Shuttleworth and Caro the next morning, went to a wine bar called Zelda's in Charlotte Street in central London and started drawing on napkins. They steadily rejected conventional designs - a suspension bridge's towers, for example, would have obscured St Paul's - for a flat, minimal platform \"stretched as tightly as possible between the two banks\", as Wise put it later. \"We went home that night tremendously excited about the purity of the diagram, and petrified that the bridge might shake itself to bits...\" </p> <p>The following morning, they gathered at Caro's studio up the road in Camden. While Caro's assistants made rough cardboard models, Wise's \"guitar string\" design evolved into the \"blade of light\" Foster envisaged. Sitting in the studio's low, boxy chairs, surrounded by bold frag ments of recent Caro projects, they did not dwell too much, at least as the meeting is remembered, on the more prosaic question of the bridge shaking. </p> <p>In December 1996, their design was announced the winner. \"And I thought that was what you built,\" says Caro, ruefully creasing his brow. \"How naive I was.\" For the next two and a half years, during many meetings at Foster and Partners, and impromptu group expeditions to the riverbanks, and an eternity of discussions with planning authorities, the actual structure of the bridge was determined. There were compromises: the flat span became a less abrupt arch, Caro's plans for elaborate ramps and gateways at either end were watered down. There were endless explanations: some sceptics in the City demanded to know how the bridge's lights could be kept free of charred insects. And, on occasions, there was a sense close to futility: when Foster gave a presentation to a City planning committee, the first ever by an architect, the first questioner afterwards thanked \"Sir Richard Rogers\". </p> <p>But Foster, unlike Caro, was used to the minefield of a public commission. At one stage, the architects successfully re-submitted some rejected drawings by making the sky bluer and the bridge users younger. \"What Nor man absolutely correctly judged,\" says Fitzpatrick, slipping easily into a public relations abstraction, \"was generating the sense of wonderment\". </p> <p>Ove Arup gave the bridge its highest rating for complexity of construction - the same as a state-of-the-art corporate fortress. The cost, met by Southwark, the City, business donors and, most of all, the millennium commission, rose from around \u00a310m to approaching \u00a320m as the committees nit-picked and the Thames harassed the workmen. Building took 13 months instead of the promised 12; at the official opening in April, the Queen could only edge halfway across. Even now, behind the hoardings at the south end, the promised landscaping is piles of wet gravel and an abandoned wheelbarrow. </p> <p>Since the bridge closed, there has been a suspicion that contemporary engineers are perhaps getting a bit carried away. The construction of models on computer screens, and the convergence of architecture and engineering have \"released the engineer\", says Whitby, \"from the need to prove absolutely he knows what he's doing\". He thinks this is good - experiment and the passing problems that result are the best way to learn more. The bridge's spin doctors have been arguing the same in recent weeks. </p> <p>But another engineer, more closely involved with the millennium scheme, disagrees. \"There's got to be tremendous care when a competition goes ahead that the engineering is sound,\" he says. He suggests that the judges in this case, who included politicians, businessmen from non-architectural fields, and the broadcaster Anna Ford, were more concerned with the look of the crossing, and the attendant possibilities for publicity, than with its structural soundness. \"I was concerned about vibration when I first saw the plans over two years ago,\" he says. </p> <p>Fitzpatrick responds that every possible test was done. A Canadian wind tunnel was hired to imitate gusts off the Thames, for example, before the bridge had even been commissioned. What about testing the span with crowds of people? There is an uncharacteristic pause. \"Load testing of a new design is extremely rare. Bridges are built to the codes developed by the great and the good... They are built well within factors of safety.\" He pauses again. \"The only way to have picked this up would have been a false opening. And you can't use the public for that.\" </p> <p>Last week, Bell offered me a bridge tour regardless. Rain was blasting up the Thames. He climbed a slippery, wet ladder in his pinstripe suit, clambered over some scaffolding onto the streaming deck, and attempted to explain the latest official position. \"The millennium wheel had its problems, but people forgot about them very quickly,\" he half-bellowed, as we battered our way to midstream. The bridge bounced very lightly beneath our feet. On all sides, above the handrails, London loomed dripping and magnificent. He grinned winningly. The spine of the bridge curved upward. We might have been climbing into the sky. </p> <p>But afterwards, in the Portakabin, a thought occurred. Would the water on the deck freeze in winter? \"The maintenance people have that under control,\" said Bell. \"Besides, things rarely freeze in London.\"</p>",

A report on China's Central Television website said that four of the team had died.</p> <p>The investigations follow a number of high-profile cases of corruption.</p> <p>Senior officials with good connections in Beijing have been implicated in a huge case of fraud and import duty evasion in Xiamen, another city in Fujian province.</p> <p>Rumours that the wife of a close associate of the president is also involved have had to be denied publicly.</p> <p>Investigators from the central commission for discipline inspection working on the investigation in Xiamen complained earlier this year that their telephones were being tapped by the local police.</p> <p>An embargo has been imposed on further news reports of the protracted case.</p> <p>Last week the Chinese parliament, the national people's congress, expelled Xie Yongwu, a member from Xiamen, on the grounds that he was suspected of being involved in smuggling.</p> <p>Other cities under investigation include Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan, where the first large-scale import scam was started by senior party officials as far back as 1985.</p> <p>Guangxi province, whose capital Nanning is on the target list, is also well known for chronic corruption.</p> <p>And a new purge of corrupt officials was launched last week in Shenzhen, the modern city across the border from Hong Kong, which is also on the list.</p> <p>A deputy mayor of the city has been implicated in a plot to fix lucrative land deals in exchange for bribes.</p> <p>Several of the team staying in the Shantou guesthouse are believed to have worked previously in another area of Guangdong, clearing up a complex graft case in the southern port city of Zhanjiang.</p> <p>Mr Jiang's speech denouncing corruption in January was only published in April, apparently as Beijing grew increasingly concerned about the Xiamen case and other scandals.</p> <p>The president condemned what he called a wave of \"feudal\" nepotism and graft, and said that \"several leading cadres\" were \"exchanging power for money and power for sex\".</p> <p>But he balanced his condemnation of corruption with a warning against attempts by foreign countries to undermine China by \"influencing us with their political views, ideology and lifestyles\".</p> <p>He returned to the theme in a speech on June 9, published yesterday, in which he called on young party cadres to \"fight against western hostile forces infiltrating and seeking to overthrow [the party]\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Officials tackling corruption in China have been shaken by a suspicious fire at the weekend which killed investigators trying to root out graft in the boom city of Shantou. The fire swept through a government guesthouse where the officials had been staying for months, killing five people. Shantou, in the north of Guangdong province, is one of 15 coastal towns and cities on which Beijing's corruption commission has focused since January when President Jiang Zemin called for a new campaign against \"unhealthy tendencies\" among senior officials in the Communist party. Other targets include Fuzhou and three other areas in Fujian province, now notorious as the source of the 58 illegal migrants found dead in Dover last month. There are strong suspicions that the \"snakehead\" gangs of human smugglers in Fujian often work in league with party and government officials to send people abroad. Initial reports from Shantou suggest that Saturday's fire, in a building which forms part of a closely guarded government compound, may have been started deliberately. The Guangdong police chief, Liang Guoju, rushed to the scene to investigate the cause, and Shantou officials were told to \"heighten their vigilance\". According to the local police, at least two of the dead belonged to the joint Beijing-provincial corruption team, and several other members of the team were seriously in jured. A report on China's Central Television website said that four of the team had died. The investigations follow a number of high-profile cases of corruption. Senior officials with good connections in Beijing have been implicated in a huge case of fraud and import duty evasion in Xiamen, another city in Fujian province. Rumours that the wife of a close associate of the president is also involved have had to be denied publicly. Investigators from the central commission for discipline inspection working on the investigation in Xiamen complained earlier this year that their telephones were being tapped by the local police. An embargo has been imposed on further news reports of the protracted case. Last week the Chinese parliament, the national people's congress, expelled Xie Yongwu, a member from Xiamen, on the grounds that he was suspected of being involved in smuggling. Other cities under investigation include Haikou, capital of the island province of Hainan, where the first large-scale import scam was started by senior party officials as far back as 1985. Guangxi province, whose capital Nanning is on the target list, is also well known for chronic corruption. And a new purge of corrupt officials was launched last week in Shenzhen, the modern city across the border from Hong Kong, which is also on the list. A deputy mayor of the city has been implicated in a plot to fix lucrative land deals in exchange for bribes. Several of the team staying in the Shantou guesthouse are believed to have worked previously in another area of Guangdong, clearing up a complex graft case in the southern port city of Zhanjiang. Mr Jiang's speech denouncing corruption in January was only published in April, apparently as Beijing grew increasingly concerned about the Xiamen case and other scandals. The president condemned what he called a wave of \"feudal\" nepotism and graft, and said that \"several leading cadres\" were \"exchanging power for money and power for sex\". But he balanced his condemnation of corruption with a warning against attempts by foreign countries to undermine China by \"influencing us with their political views, ideology and lifestyles\". He returned to the theme in a speech on June 9, published yesterday, in which he called on young party cadres to \"fight against western hostile forces infiltrating and seeking to overthrow [the party]\".",

      "body": "<p>The government is failing to invest sufficient resources in the training of the next generation of actors and dancers, according to an influential new report out today which highlights the many anomalies in current funding arrangements for specialist further and higher-education courses. </p> <p>The report, commissioned by the National Council for Drama Training, broadly welcomes the speedy introduction last year of a new scholarship scheme - the so-called Dance and Drama Awards (DaDA) scheme - by the incoming Labour government, which helped more than 800 students in its first year. But it is essentially inadequate in its scope, under-funded and bureaucratically very complex, the report says. </p> <p>Mindful of the recent attention given to sports training after Britain's spectacular failures in Euro 2000, the 1998 World Cup and in tennis and cricket, its author, Graham Marchant, an independent arts consultant, concludes: \"Britain is already seeing the results of failure to invest properly in training in sports activity; it would be a disaster if similar mistakes were made in one of the few other arenas where this country has an absolutely outstanding international reputation to defend.\" </p> <p>The Marchant report on actors' training was commissioned by the NCDT, the body which accredits and oversees the standard and content of the training for actors and stage managers provided by the drama schools. It wanted an independent assessment of the success of the scholarships - introduced a year ago to provide the first mandatory funding for trainee actors, dancers and stage managers - at the end of their first year in operation, with a view to establishing how they might be improved and extended in future. </p> <p>Ministers say that whatever the weaknesses of the new system, which has had some changes since its introduction, it is infinitely preferable to \"the appalling shambles\" that existed before. The incoming Labour administration inherited a hugely complicated web of courses for actors and dancers. These range from arguably the best quality courses, run by the tiny independent schools which did not qualify for state funding, to thousands of courses in performing arts and media which are not even recognised or connected to the industry. </p> <p>Until the late eighties, students who wanted to enter the profession through a three-year course at an independent drama school relied on discretionary funding from their local education authority on the same basis as anyone at a university. Their fees were paid in full, and their maintenance grant depended on parental income. But local authorities came under pressure from central government over the next decade, so fewer grants were available. The system turned into a restricted \"postcode lottery\", with funds determined by where students lived rather than talent. </p> <p>The situation became so bad that the Arts Council of England was persuaded to use lottery funds for an emergency Interim Funding Scheme (IFS) for dance and drama students. But even this continued the basic inequity of a geographical lottery for students, and was swept away when the incoming Labour government ordered the Department for Education and Employment and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to agree a new, fairer system of receiving grants. Education secretary David Blunkett was appalled that the issue was one of the main topics dominating MPs' postbags. </p> <p>The new-look Dance and Drama Awards Scheme was formally announced by higher education minister Baroness Blackstone in November 1998. Initially it involved 820 scholarships, worth around \u00a36,000 a year, allocated to 29 private institutions with approved courses. Among the top dance and drama schools taking part in the scheme are the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, the English National Ballet School, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Northern Ballet School and the Birmingham School of Speech and Drama. </p> <p>As Peter Cheeseman, chairman of NCDT, comments in his statement prefacing the report: \"The new mandatory scheme is a great milestone in the history of our state funding for the arts. The crisis had become so serious that hardly any grants were available to students who had passed the rigorous audition procedures and gained a place at our vocational drama schools. Only students from really wealthy families, and state-funded students from other countries, were becoming able to enter training. This was an appalling waste of national talent.\" </p> <p>But the Marchant report is realistic about ongoing poverty among Britain's trainee stars. Such poverty is experienced by those who have won scholarships and those who have not and who have to resort to writing begging letters or taking part-time jobs on top of their gruelling training. </p> <p>\"Until the government is ready to use the funds it has available to support drama training with maximum efficiency, the charitable sector - and individual actors - must take the strain. This is simply wrong,\" Marchant says. So the scheme has helped create a \"two-tier\" system by discriminating between \"talented\" students who win the sought-after awards and so-called \"untalented\" ones who are on the same prestigious courses but without the benefit of the scholarship. \"A better way to strangle the great British tradition of team acting at birth would be hard to imagine\" is one of his gritty conclusions. </p> <p>To solve this problem, more scholarships should be provided, the report says: \"Since the industry believes that all the courses accredited by NCDT are appropriate and needed, then the government should provide enough funding for the numbers of British students needed to maintain those courses.\" </p> <p>Another concern is that many of the courses run at the best-known schools, such as the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, have been allocated to the further education sector when they should properly be part of higher education with a more appropriate structure of independent scrutiny. And while students on FE courses get assistance with annual fees of up to \u00a39,000, they are ineligible to apply for student loans. </p> <p>The DfEE has, however, trebled the size of a special hardship fund to help out FE students, allowing them to claim up to \u00a33,000 in living expenses. But the Marchant report wants all students on the accredited courses to be eligible for student loans like any other student in higher education in Britain. In this way, the funding of all three-year dance and drama courses would be put on an equal footing with traditional university courses, which allow students to get maintenance grants as well as the payment of their fees over the \u00a31,050 which they pay. </p> <p>Adele Bailey, executive director of the NCDT, says: \"The problem is that there aren't enough scholarships to go round for the recognised courses. And the scheme is an ugly one, with raw edges. Only 20 out of the 30 students admitted to Rada every year get funding through the scheme. You can't say the other ten are not talented.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Funding of Drama Student Training in Britain, Autumn 1999, by Graham Marchant is published by the National Council for Drama Training, supported by funds from The Mackintosh Foundation and the Society of London Theatre.</p> <p><strong>'It's no way to train or live'</strong></p> <p><strong> Ben Weeratunge </strong> is 19 and has just completed his first year of a three-year course leading to a National Diploma in Classical Ballet at the Central School of Ballet in Clerkenwell, central London. </p> <p>The teenager - whose striking stage presence and looks are due in part to his half-Thai background - is one of 18 students at the college with a sought-after DaDA scholarship. But that only covers up to \u00a37,300 of his \u00a39,500 annual fees, leaving him a shortfall in addition to the \u00a31,050 he must meet himself.

The good thing about my internship is that you work alongside consultants on real projects, rather than just making the tea,\" he explains. But if the worst happens, and you are heading for a long summer of shelf stacking or dish washing, employers and careers advisers suggest that you can still use it to your advantage once you graduate. Whatever you do to earn money, the important thing is to make the most of it on your CV. Ben Johnston, graduate recruitment manager for Andersen Consulting, favours CVs that show how students have effected some change, regardless of the level or nature of work they have done. \"Whether you worked in a bar or on an e-commerce project, the main thing is to show that you did more than was simply required.\"",

      "body": "<p>Madam Speaker</p> <p>I turn now to the investment we must make in our economic future. Britain has great strengths - the best place in Europe to do business, with world class companies in science and technology - but to build for the future , we must put in place the long term investment which is the precondition of a strong economy and of bridging the productivity gap with our competitors and avoid the short-termism of the past.</p> <p>Working with business, the role of modern Government is not to subsidise loss-makers, or to attempt to pick winners.</p> <p>The new role of Government is to invest in science and innovation, to promote competition, small business development and enterprise for all, to encourage balanced regional development and meet the pressing needs of transport and infrastructure and most of all to invest in the greatest driver of prosperity - education and skills.</p> <p>First, investment in science. With our investment in a one billion pound public private partnership with Wellcome to re-equip university science and extra resources to support pioneering medical research, we will raise the science budget by 5.4 per cent a year.</p> <p>And to ensure invention in Britain leads to manufacturing in Britain and jobs in Britain, the Secretary for Industry will announce new resources for the University Challenge Fund that commercialises inventions and for university-based Regional Enterprise Centres.</p> <p>Britain's small businesses are the backbone of our local economies. And to offer new services businesses have themselves requested, the budget of the new Small Business Service will rise substantially from 197 million pounds this year to 277 million pounds by 2004. This will include a national Internet service offering comprehensive business advice and a consultancy service for start-ups, worth up to 2,000 pounds for start ups in high unemployment areas. So that the numbers of small businesses who employ, which have already risen from 1.2 million in 1997 to 1.3 million, can expand in every area of the country.</p> <p>The newest and most decisive challenge in the new century demanding higher levels of investment is to master and lead in the new information technologies from the Internet to e-commerce.</p> <p>To make Britain best for electronic trading and to bridge the growing digital divide, the Review has agreed a three year programme of rapidly rising investment in our schools and our communities and a new fund the Prime Minister will announce to ensure that by 2005, Britain will have all Government services offered on line.</p> <p>Investment in innovation, infrastructure and skills is essential in every region if there is to be high levels of productivity in Britain and full employment throughout our country.</p> <p>To secure balanced regional development, Regional Development Agencies will receive new resources, their budgets increased by 500 million pounds a year by 2003-2004. There will not only be new funds but new flexibilities so that local people can promote local priorities and meet local needs they have themselves identified; in the North West promoting innovation and research; in the North East, increasing entrepreneurship; in Yorkshire and Humberside, small business development; in the East Midlands, information and communications technology; in the West Midlands, modern manufacturing; in the South East and South West, as in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with their devolved decision-making, the promotion of clusters of growth; in every region new support for skills, employment and for schools and colleges to promote enterprise open to all.</p> <p>The overall settlement for Scotland provides for an increase of 3.4 billion pounds a year by 2003-04, an annual real terms rise of 4.4 per cent. A separate announcement will be made by the Scottish Executive.</p> <p>For the Objective 1 areas in the UK - in Wales, Cornwall, Merseyside, South Yorkshire - and for Objective 2 and 3 areas I am announcing a new approach that will raise their levels of investment.</p> <p>Within our departmental allocations we are making today the Government will ensure funding for the European share of Objective 1, 2 and 3 projects.</p> <p>For EU structural funds this is estimated to total 4.2 billion pounds over three years, including an estimated total of 600 million for new Objective 1 programmes in English regions.</p> <p>The settlement increases funding for Wales by a total of 5.4 per cent a year in real terms and allows for match funding - and includes a special allocation to ensure funding of the European share of Wales' Objective 1 needs, an allocation to Wales of 80 million, 90 million, 102 million pounds over the next three years. I am also transferring management of the European Social Fund allocations for Wales of 149 million pounds over the next three years to the Welsh Assembly.</p> <p>It is because of the importance to all regions of modern transport and infrastructure that we will now make a step change in investment in public transport.</p> <p>Having in the Budget removed the automatic fuel escalator, extra money was allocated to roads and public transport this year. And now we are able to raise spending on roads and public transport by significant extra sums to meet the needs of business and the public, from 4.9 billion pounds this year to 6 billions next year, then to 7.4 billions and 9.1 billions in 2003-2004, a real terms rise of 20 per cent a year to 2004. Details of the targets to improve rail and bus services and to cut road congestion and of the allocation of funds will be set out in the Ten Year Plan published by the Deputy Prime Minister on Thursday.</p> <p>The modern economy can succeed only when it uses all the talent of all its people. Any potential squandered is a resource denied to the country's future. In this Review we allocate new funds to advance our goal of full employment.</p> <p>For 70,000 employers, nearly 500,000 young people and for Britain, which has seen long-term youth unemployment fall by 70 per cent, the New Deal has been succeeding, a central building block for our policy of full employment.</p> <p>So long-term youth unemployment which rose to 500,000 in the 1980s is 50,000 today.</p> <p>The Windfall Levy raised over 5 billion pounds with 1.6 billion allocated to schools, 3.5 billion to employment creation.</p> <p>Because the New Deal has been even more successful than forecast, with more getting back to work more quickly, there is an underspend, enabling us to fund the New Deal well into the next Parliament, and to transform what started as the New Deal for the young unemployed into a permanent deal for all long-term unemployed.</p> <p>Having helped 500,000 on the New Deal, we now set plans to help the next 500,000. Next year and until 2003, I expect 1.7 billion pounds to be available from the Windfall Levy to do more to coach the hard-to-employ young unemployed and to systematically create new opportunities for our long-term unemployed, nearly one million single parents and thousands of disabled men and women who want to work.</p> <p>To bring both child care and employment within the reach of more parents, child care investment will rise from 66 million pounds this year to 200 million by 2003-2004, as we deliver our national child care strategy.</p> <p>Because of our success in cutting unemployment social security spending, which grew by 4 per cent a year in the last Parliament, is growing by 1.5 per cent a year over the next three years and the budget for unemployment related benefits is falling.</p> <p>To make further social security savings by tackling fraud and error we are announcing new investment in staff and technology. Having cut errors in income support claims by half, we now plan to cut fraud and error in the job seekers allowance and income support payments, first by 25 per cent by 2004 and then 50 per cent.</p> <p>It is by continuing a prudent policy - economic stability, the New Deal, and tackling fraud and waste - that we are able to reallocate funds from unemployment and debt interest, to be used for our priorities in education and health.</p> <p>I turn now to investment to ensure all children have the best start in life. Today's children will be tomorrow's doctors, scientists, engineers and nurses - our future workforce. By investing in children, we are investing in our country's future.</p> <p>Having invested 7 billion pounds a year more in families - raising Child Benefit by 35 per cent to 15.50 pounds, guaranteeing a minimum family income under the Working Families Tax Credit and from next April the new Children's Tax Credit giving the typical family 442 pounds a year - it is time to take an additional step.</p> <p>The war against child poverty requires not only additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community. And it can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together.</p> <p>So in a unique initiative - and after consultations with charities and voluntary organisations - we will create a national Children's Fund with a budget over 3 years totalling 450 million pounds to help children and young people at risk.</p> <p>The Children's Fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations - secular and faith based - and support those dedicated staff and committed volunteers who offer one-to-one help to young people - and parents - at risk. 70 million pounds will be allocated to a network of 50 local and regional children's funds.</p> <p>Madam Speaker</p> <p>I turn to investment in education as a whole.</p> <p>With the funds the Secretary of State for Education allocated from the first Spending Review he has made reforms in education -ensuring nursery education for every four year old, cut class sizes for 5-7 year olds, raised literary and numeracy standards for 11 year olds by 6 and 10 percentage points, and reformed and expanded higher and further education.</p> <p>Education qualifications are, in the modern world, the surest route to opportunity and security for all.</p> <p>First, all children should be ready to learn when they reach school.</p> <p>From the first Spending Review came Sure Start - now lifting 50,000 children and their parents out of poverty. In this second Review - and tied to targets for improving child development and parental responsibility - we will, by 2004, and with a budget of 500 million pounds, expand the number of children helped to 345,000.</p> <p>And with nursery places already increasing from 200,000 in 1997 to 400,000 in 2002 the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will announce funds for the next stage in the expansion of nursery education</p> <p>Second, having improved standards in our primary schools, the next task is now to raise standards as decisively in the secondary schools --- so that the expansion of resources the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will announce for all schools is designed to back up reform and to being about radical improvement within the comprehensive system to ensure opportunity for all means the highest standards for all</p> <p>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment will now consult on and fund a new target for our secondary schools - by 2007 not today's 60 per cent but 85 per cent of 14 years olds must meet literacy, numeracy and computer standards.</p> <p>To raise Britain's appallingly low staying-on rate, we are setting aside 150 million pounds a year for education maintenance allowances worth up to 40 pounds a week. Our new and challenging target is by 2004, 80,000 more young 16-18 year olds staying in education and by age 21 nearly 60 per cent of young people will have left school or college with A levels or their equivalent.</p> <p>Under the New Deal for Schools 17,000 of our schools will have had some improvement, modernisation or renovation by 2002, and every one of our 32,000 schools will be linked to the Internet, with the objective of by 2004 500,000 more computers in our schools.</p> <p>By 2010 we want the majority of young people to go on to higher education. The Secretary of State is today allocating 100 million pounds extra to higher education in 2001-02, making a 4.6 per cent real terms increase in total. And the Review provides further finance that will raise the numbers in part-time and full-time higher and further education - towards our goal of 50 per cent of young people going into higher education by the end of the decade.</p> <p>State school pupils secure two-thirds of the top A Level qualifications but only half the places in some of our leading universities. To bridge this gap the Secretary for Education is today setting a new objective to improve access. The Higher Education Funding Council will provide financial help for universities submitting plans for year-on-year improvements in widening access.</p> <p>2 million adults have a reading age of 7 or less. Adult illiteracy is not just a failure of our society but - as business leaders round the country have told me - an economic inefficiency that cannot any longer be tolerated. In the coming weeks, the Secretary for Education will announce the new resources provided to tackle these barriers to opportunity and earnings.</p> <p>Madam Speaker</p> <p>The best education for all, from early learning to lifelong learning, is not only a time-honoured social ideal, but in today's world an absolute economic necessity.</p> <p>That is why we have decided to make increased investment in education the priority of this year's Review and to back sustained long-term reform with a sustained increase in resources.</p> <p>In the Budget I was able to allocate new resources to the NHS, amounting to a rise of 6.1 per cent a year in real terms over four years to 2004.</p> <p>I was also able to allocate an additional one billion pounds to UK education this year.</p> <p>Today, in return for new targets for improved standards, I can allocate further resources for UK education for the next three years.</p> <p>Under the last Government, UK education spending rose by an average of only 1.5 per cent a year in real terms .</p> <p>Over the next three years, UK education spending will rise by 5.4 per cent a year in real terms.</p> <p>Spending will rise from last year's 40.6 billion pounds, and this year's 45.8 billions to 49.5 billions next year: 53.4 billions the year after; then 57.7 billions.</p> <p>And the money I have announced in the Budget and now today will deliver, over the four years up to 2004, an average annual increase of 6.6 per cent in real terms. An annual rate of growth far in excess of the 1.5 per cent achieved from 1979 to 1997.</p> <p>I have one further announcement.</p> <p>In March the Secretary for Education made special payments direct to head teachers for books and equipment ranging from 3,000 pounds to 9,000 pounds for primary schools and from 30,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds for secondary schools. 290 million pounds in total that went direct to the head teacher, to be spent by the school for use in the classroom.</p> <p>The Government has decided to continue this innovation.</p> <p>But next April the Education Secretary will allocate to our head teachers not 290 million pounds, but 540 millions.</p> <p>As a result, head teachers in every one of our smaller primary schools will next year receive not 3,000 pounds but a payment of 6,000 pounds.</p> <p>The larger primary schools, not 9,000 pounds but a payment of 20,000 pounds. For the smaller secondary schools there will now be payments of 50,000 pounds rising for the larger secondary schools to a payment of 70,000 pounds. And these payments will now be made not just for one year but for every year until 2004. And every school throughout our country.</p> <p>So, Madam Speaker, we have made our choice. It is now for those who oppose our spending plans to state clearly where their cuts would fall.</p> <p>This Government has been prudent for a purpose.</p> <p>Our choice is stability. Employment. And sustained long-term investment, now and into the next Parliament to create a Britain of security and opportunity for all.</p> <p>And I commend this Statement to the House.</p>",

Britain has great strengths - the best place in Europe to do business, with world class companies in science and technology - but to build for the future , we must put in place the long term investment which is the precondition of a strong economy and of bridging the productivity gap with our competitors and avoid the short-termism of the past. Working with business, the role of modern Government is not to subsidise loss-makers, or to attempt to pick winners. The new role of Government is to invest in science and innovation, to promote competition, small business development and enterprise for all, to encourage balanced regional development and meet the pressing needs of transport and infrastructure and most of all to invest in the greatest driver of prosperity - education and skills. First, investment in science. With our investment in a one billion pound public private partnership with Wellcome to re-equip university science and extra resources to support pioneering medical research, we will raise the science budget by 5.4 per cent a year. And to ensure invention in Britain leads to manufacturing in Britain and jobs in Britain, the Secretary for Industry will announce new resources for the University Challenge Fund that commercialises inventions and for university-based Regional Enterprise Centres.

So that the numbers of small businesses who employ, which have already risen from 1.2 million in 1997 to 1.3 million, can expand in every area of the country. The newest and most decisive challenge in the new century demanding higher levels of investment is to master and lead in the new information technologies from the Internet to e-commerce. To make Britain best for electronic trading and to bridge the growing digital divide, the Review has agreed a three year programme of rapidly rising investment in our schools and our communities and a new fund the Prime Minister will announce to ensure that by 2005, Britain will have all Government services offered on line. Investment in innovation, infrastructure and skills is essential in every region if there is to be high levels of productivity in Britain and full employment throughout our country. To secure balanced regional development, Regional Development Agencies will receive new resources, their budgets increased by 500 million pounds a year by 2003-2004. There will not only be new funds but new flexibilities so that local people can promote local priorities and meet local needs they have themselves identified; in the North West promoting innovation and research; in the North East, increasing entrepreneurship; in Yorkshire and Humberside, small business development; in the East Midlands, information and communications technology; in the West Midlands, modern manufacturing; in the South East and South West, as in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with their devolved decision-making, the promotion of clusters of growth; in every region new support for skills, employment and for schools and colleges to promote enterprise open to all. The overall settlement for Scotland provides for an increase of 3.4 billion pounds a year by 2003-04, an annual real terms rise of 4.4 per cent. A separate announcement will be made by the Scottish Executive. For the Objective 1 areas in the UK - in Wales, Cornwall, Merseyside, South Yorkshire - and for Objective 2 and 3 areas I am announcing a new approach that will raise their levels of investment. Within our departmental allocations we are making today the Government will ensure funding for the European share of Objective 1, 2 and 3 projects. For EU structural funds this is estimated to total 4.2 billion pounds over three years, including an estimated total of 600 million for new Objective 1 programmes in English regions. The settlement increases funding for Wales by a total of 5.4 per cent a year in real terms and allows for match funding - and includes a special allocation to ensure funding of the European share of Wales' Objective 1 needs, an allocation to Wales of 80 million, 90 million, 102 million pounds over the next three years. I am also transferring management of the European Social Fund allocations for Wales of 149 million pounds over the next three years to the Welsh Assembly.

Details of the targets to improve rail and bus services and to cut road congestion and of the allocation of funds will be set out in the Ten Year Plan published by the Deputy Prime Minister on Thursday. The modern economy can succeed only when it uses all the talent of all its people. Any potential squandered is a resource denied to the country's future. In this Review we allocate new funds to advance our goal of full employment. For 70,000 employers, nearly 500,000 young people and for Britain, which has seen long-term youth unemployment fall by 70 per cent, the New Deal has been succeeding, a central building block for our policy of full employment. So long-term youth unemployment which rose to 500,000 in the 1980s is 50,000 today. The Windfall Levy raised over 5 billion pounds with 1.6 billion allocated to schools, 3.5 billion to employment creation. Because the New Deal has been even more successful than forecast, with more getting back to work more quickly, there is an underspend, enabling us to fund the New Deal well into the next Parliament, and to transform what started as the New Deal for the young unemployed into a permanent deal for all long-term unemployed. Having helped 500,000 on the New Deal, we now set plans to help the next 500,000. Next year and until 2003, I expect 1.7 billion pounds to be available from the Windfall Levy to do more to coach the hard-to-employ young unemployed and to systematically create new opportunities for our long-term unemployed, nearly one million single parents and thousands of disabled men and women who want to work. To bring both child care and employment within the reach of more parents, child care investment will rise from 66 million pounds this year to 200 million by 2003-2004, as we deliver our national child care strategy. Because of our success in cutting unemployment social security spending, which grew by 4 per cent a year in the last Parliament, is growing by 1.5 per cent a year over the next three years and the budget for unemployment related benefits is falling. To make further social security savings by tackling fraud and error we are announcing new investment in staff and technology. Having cut errors in income support claims by half, we now plan to cut fraud and error in the job seekers allowance and income support payments, first by 25 per cent by 2004 and then 50 per cent. It is by continuing a prudent policy - economic stability, the New Deal, and tackling fraud and waste - that we are able to reallocate funds from unemployment and debt interest, to be used for our priorities in education and health. I turn now to investment to ensure all children have the best start in life. Today's children will be tomorrow's doctors, scientists, engineers and nurses - our future workforce. By investing in children, we are investing in our country's future. Having invested 7 billion pounds a year more in families - raising Child Benefit by 35 per cent to 15.50 pounds, guaranteeing a minimum family income under the Working Families Tax Credit and from next April the new Children's Tax Credit giving the typical family 442 pounds a year - it is time to take an additional step. The war against child poverty requires not only additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community. And it can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together. So in a unique initiative - and after consultations with charities and voluntary organisations - we will create a national Children's Fund with a budget over 3 years totalling 450 million pounds to help children and young people at risk. The Children's Fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations - secular and faith based - and support those dedicated staff and committed volunteers who offer one-to-one help to young people - and parents - at risk. 70 million pounds will be allocated to a network of 50 local and regional children's funds. Madam Speaker I turn to investment in education as a whole. With the funds the Secretary of State for Education allocated from the first Spending Review he has made reforms in education -ensuring nursery education for every four year old, cut class sizes for 5-7 year olds, raised literary and numeracy standards for 11 year olds by 6 and 10 percentage points, and reformed and expanded higher and further education. Education qualifications are, in the modern world, the surest route to opportunity and security for all. First, all children should be ready to learn when they reach school. From the first Spending Review came Sure Start - now lifting 50,000 children and their parents out of poverty. In this second Review - and tied to targets for improving child development and parental responsibility - we will, by 2004, and with a budget of 500 million pounds, expand the number of children helped to 345,000. And with nursery places already increasing from 200,000 in 1997 to 400,000 in 2002 the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will announce funds for the next stage in the expansion of nursery education Second, having improved standards in our primary schools, the next task is now to raise standards as decisively in the secondary schools --- so that the expansion of resources the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will announce for all schools is designed to back up reform and to being about radical improvement within the comprehensive system to ensure opportunity for all means the highest standards for all The Secretary of State for Education and Employment will now consult on and fund a new target for our secondary schools - by 2007 not today's 60 per cent but 85 per cent of 14 years olds must meet literacy, numeracy and computer standards. To raise Britain's appallingly low staying-on rate, we are setting aside 150 million pounds a year for education maintenance allowances worth up to 40 pounds a week. Our new and challenging target is by 2004, 80,000 more young 16-18 year olds staying in education and by age 21 nearly 60 per cent of young people will have left school or college with A levels or their equivalent. Under the New Deal for Schools 17,000 of our schools will have had some improvement, modernisation or renovation by 2002, and every one of our 32,000 schools will be linked to the Internet, with the objective of by 2004 500,000 more computers in our schools. By 2010 we want the majority of young people to go on to higher education. The Secretary of State is today allocating 100 million pounds extra to higher education in 2001-02, making a 4.6 per cent real terms increase in total. And the Review provides further finance that will raise the numbers in part-time and full-time higher and further education - towards our goal of 50 per cent of young people going into higher education by the end of the decade. State school pupils secure two-thirds of the top A Level qualifications but only half the places in some of our leading universities. To bridge this gap the Secretary for Education is today setting a new objective to improve access. The Higher Education Funding Council will provide financial help for universities submitting plans for year-on-year improvements in widening access. 2 million adults have a reading age of 7 or less. Adult illiteracy is not just a failure of our society but - as business leaders round the country have told me - an economic inefficiency that cannot any longer be tolerated. In the coming weeks, the Secretary for Education will announce the new resources provided to tackle these barriers to opportunity and earnings. Madam Speaker The best education for all, from early learning to lifelong learning, is not only a time-honoured social ideal, but in today's world an absolute economic necessity. That is why we have decided to make increased investment in education the priority of this year's Review and to back sustained long-term reform with a sustained increase in resources. In the Budget I was able to allocate new resources to the NHS, amounting to a rise of 6.1 per cent a year in real terms over four years to 2004. I was also able to allocate an additional one billion pounds to UK education this year. Today, in return for new targets for improved standards, I can allocate further resources for UK education for the next three years. Under the last Government, UK education spending rose by an average of only 1.5 per cent a year in real terms . Over the next three years, UK education spending will rise by 5.4 per cent a year in real terms. Spending will rise from last year's 40.6 billion pounds, and this year's 45.8 billions to 49.5 billions next year: 53.4 billions the year after; then 57.7 billions. And the money I have announced in the Budget and now today will deliver, over the four years up to 2004, an average annual increase of 6.6 per cent in real terms. An annual rate of growth far in excess of the 1.5 per cent achieved from 1979 to 1997. I have one further announcement. In March the Secretary for Education made special payments direct to head teachers for books and equipment ranging from 3,000 pounds to 9,000 pounds for primary schools and from 30,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds for secondary schools. 290 million pounds in total that went direct to the head teacher, to be spent by the school for use in the classroom. The Government has decided to continue this innovation. But next April the Education Secretary will allocate to our head teachers not 290 million pounds, but 540 millions. As a result, head teachers in every one of our smaller primary schools will next year receive not 3,000 pounds but a payment of 6,000 pounds. The larger primary schools, not 9,000 pounds but a payment of 20,000 pounds. For the smaller secondary schools there will now be payments of 50,000 pounds rising for the larger secondary schools to a payment of 70,000 pounds. And these payments will now be made not just for one year but for every year until 2004. And every school throughout our country. So, Madam Speaker, we have made our choice. It is now for those who oppose our spending plans to state clearly where their cuts would fall. This Government has been prudent for a purpose. Our choice is stability. Employment. And sustained long-term investment, now and into the next Parliament to create a Britain of security and opportunity for all. And I commend this Statement to the House.",

      "body": "<p>The public spending allocations for 2001 to 2004 that I am announcing today are possible because - having eliminated the 28 billion pounds deficit we inherited and having reduced the national debt - the state of our public finances is strong.</p> <p>In the economic cycles of the last 30 years the current budget deficits averaged 109 billions pounds, the national debt doubled and rose to 44 per cent of national income in 1997 and stop-go in the economy meant stop-go in the public finances.</p> <p>So our first task was to create stability and sustainable public finances - and having set clear fiscal rules over the economic cycle - a current budget in balance, borrowing only to invest within prudent and cautious limits - today we not only have low inflation and stable growth but year-on-year current budget surpluses and debt falling below 40 per cent of national income. Indeed debt being repaid this year and next.</p> <p>And it is this sustained and sustainable improvement in our public finances that makes possible a sustained and sustainable improvement in our public services.</p> <p>Our second task was to encourage the work ethic and secure rising employment. And today with the assistance of the New Deal, unemployment is at its lowest for 20 years and almost 28 million people, more people than ever before are in work in our country today.</p> <p>Now, building on the foundation of stability and strengthened economic fundamentals, we can move to the next stage in creating a better future:</p> <p>- to make good the damage done by the legacy of decades of under-investment across our public services;</p> <p>- and to realise long-term national goals we have set for a decade - to close the productivity gap with our competitors, to deliver and sustain full employment, to secure higher education for a majority of our young people, to halve and then abolish child poverty and to build strong public services as we create a Britain where there is security and opportunity not just for a few but for everyone.</p> <p>And the first conclusion of this year's Spending Review is that prudent targeted long-term investment is not only a social good, but in a changing and often insecure world an economic necessity.</p> <p>It is only by investment in education, in science and in the future of our children that we can equip ourselves for future economic success and ensure there is opportunity for all.</p> <p>It is only by investing in health, transport, the environment and in law and order that we can ensure a more productive economy and security for all.</p> <p>And just as stability and economic strength makes possible investment, so too new investment reinforces stability and creates longer-term economic strength.</p> <p>So, while we will raise current expenditure only in line with our neutral view of trend growth - by 2. 5 per cent a year - we propose to tackle the long-term neglect of investment in our country with a step change in capital investment for education, science, health, policing and in our transport and infrastructure.</p> <p>As I announced in the Budget, net capital investment will more than double, rising from 7 billion pounds this year to 19 billions by 2004 , within a ceiling for public investment of 1.8 per cent of national income as we renew our public services.</p> <p>The second conclusion of our Spending Review is that it is by tying new resources to reform and results, and by locking in incentives, penalties, inspection and information that we ensure new investment goes to front line services:</p> <p>- in secondary as well as primary schools, new targets for literacy and numeracy and IT;</p> <p>- in hospitals, new systems of inspection;</p> <p>- in law and order, reforms to criminal justice;</p> <p>- in defence, implementing the next stage of the Strategic Defence Review;</p> <p>- with local government, new public service agreements; - in transport, a new partnership between private and public sector.</p> <p>At every stage money will be tied to output and performance.</p> <p>Let me give full details of the financial background.</p> <p>In the Budget I confirmed the current surpluses from 2000 onwards would be 14 billion pounds, 16,13, 8 and 8 billion pounds.</p> <p>My Budget also confirmed net borrowing will be minus 6.5, minus 5, plus 3, plus 11, plus 13 billion pounds, lower borrowing in every year than in any year of the last Parliament.</p> <p>I said that, as a share of national income, debt will be 35 per cent, 34, 33, 33, 33 and thus even with our programme of public investment we meet both our fiscal rules and do so even on the most cautious case and a cautious view of trend growth at 2.25 per cent.</p> <p>In accordance with the code of fiscal stability, I will publish the second fiscal forecasts of the year in the autumn. But I can already report that since the Budget the fiscal position has further strengthened.</p> <p>For the year ending March 2000, the current surplus is healthier than originally forecast at the time of the Budget. Not 17.1 billion, but 20.4 billion pounds.</p> <p>Debt as a share of GDP has been reduced even more, from 37.1 to 36.8 per cent.</p> <p>Indeed, I will use a further underspend of 2.5 billion pounds in annually managed expenditure to repay debt. Two billion pounds in departmental expenditure can be carried forward.</p> <p>However, on grounds of prudence, I have decided to allow a carry forward of only 1.5 billion pounds and to allow spending of only half of that this year and half next year - and to allocate the remaining half a billion to repay more debt.</p> <p>It is only because we have put the public finances on a sustainable footing that I can raise spending today. It is this same discipline that allows me to inform the House that this year we have repaid 6.2 billion pounds more debt than the 11.9 billion originally planned. In total a debt repayment of 18.1 billion pounds, the largest repayment of debt in any year since the War .</p> <p>Madam Speaker</p> <p>We have not and will not relax our discipline. So I have three policy announcements to underpin the strength of the public finances. Further limited sales of spectrum will take place by the end of 2001. And we will not repeat the mistakes of the North Sea Oil windfall and of the privatisation sales where receipts were immediately used up in current spending. I can confirm that all the capital proceeds will - as with the 22 billions from the first sale - go to further reduce the burden of debt.</p> <p>As debt is reduced so too are debt interest payments. And the first spectrum sale alone will reduce the bill for debt interest by a further 1 billion pounds a year by 2003-04. Money that - as I will confirm later this afternoon - will - year after year - go directly to improving public services.</p> <p>Second, departments and authorities will make asset and property sales of 4 billion pounds a year over the next three years - 4 billion a year released by realising unproductive assets we do not need to fund, service improvements we do need.</p> <p>And because money is tied to modernisation, the new public service agreements signed with departments - and for the first time with local government - will not only specify agreed outcomes but precise timetables for making necessary reforms.</p> <p>And I can tell the House, as a result of efficiency targets and a fall in the share of administration costs in total Government spending, new money makes possible a substantial shift in spending to the front line services - to recruit more nurses, doctors, teachers, classroom assistants, and police, more staff in our front line services.</p> <p>And with the success of the New Deal, the bills for social and economic failure are now 3.5 billion lower, enabling us to transfer 3.5 billion each year from paying unemployment benefits to funding public services.</p> <p>And with this improvement comes a radical shift in the composition of public spending. Our promise was to reduce the costs of failure - the bills for unemployment and debt interest - in order to reallocate money to the key public services.</p> <p>In the two decades from 1979 until 1997, rising debt interest and unemployment and social security accounted for 42 per cent of all extra public spending and that meant that 42 pence in every additional pound spent was not available to the key public services.</p> <p>In the coming three years, unemployment, social security and debt interest payments will account for not 42 per cent but now only 17 per cent of extra public spending, even as we direct more money to child benefit and the minimum income guarantee - and that leaves around 80 per cent of new money for health, education, transport, policing and other public services. Extra resources now available to us, not at the expense of our prudence, but because of our prudence.</p> <p>So within our fiscal rules and within the envelope I set in the Budget and have strictly adhered to, I can announce that spending on public services - what is called the departmental expenditure limit - is able to rise from 195 billion pounds this year and our previously planned 203 billion next year to 212.1 billions and then to 229 billions in 2002-2003 to 246 billions in 2003-2004. By 2004 an extra 43 billion pounds a year now to be allocated to front line services.</p> <p>Sustained improvements in public services now made possible because with stability and strengthened economic fundamentals, and lower debt interest and lower unemployment, we have sustained improvements in our public finances.</p> <p>So I now turn to the departmental allocations.</p> <p>In recent years, in addition to their conventional responsibilities, Britain's defence forces have taken on a new and valued role in international peacekeeping and in conflict prevention - promoting human rights and peace throughout the world including in Sierra Leone and Kosovo.</p> <p>To complete the restructuring agreed in the Strategic Defence Review - to fund new equipment and to increase the mobility and efficiency of our front line forces - defence spending, which has been falling in real terms every year since the end of the Cold War, will now increase in real terms. The allocations are 23.6 billion pounds next year rising to 25 billion in 2003-2004.</p> <p>The rise in the Foreign Office budget from 1.2 billion pounds next year to 1.32 billion in 2003-2004 will not only finance the proper representation and promotion of Britain abroad but also the Foreign Secretary is announcing today that the British Council will receive extra funds and the budget for the BBC World Service will rise substantially from 174 million pounds this year to 180 million pounds next year, to 210 million by the end of the period to achieve our new target of 153 million World Service listeners by 2002.</p> <p>Because we take seriously our international responsibilities to the environment - and following an interdepartmental review of nuclear safety - the Government is announcing today a special 85 million pound fund to assist nuclear clean up at Chernobyl.</p> <p>The international community's clearest duty and greatest challenge is to halve world poverty by 2015 and make primary education universal for every child.</p> <p>Our international aid budget will rise from 2.8 billion pounds this year to 3.1 billion next year, then 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion by 2004, a real terms rise of 6.2 per cent a year - in contrast to the falling share of national income devoted to overseas aid from 1979 to 1997, now a rising share of national income today and in the future, as we honour in full our commitment to debt relief, our obligation to the poorest countries of the world.</p> <p>I turn to our second set of decisions, new investment to build stronger communities.</p> <p>The Home Office budget will rise from 8.2 billion pounds this year to 9.6 billion next year, to 10.3 billion the year after, to 10.6 billion pounds in 2003-2004, an annual rise in real terms averaging 6.4 per cent a year. And tomorrow the Home Secretary will set out both his targets and how this allocation will be spent.</p> <p>To fully implement the Good Friday Agreement, an extra 316 million pounds over three years will help fund the modernisation of policing and criminal justice in Northern Ireland, and in this way help underpin peace and future prosperity.</p> <p>Every community in the land is weakened by the evil of drugs. In return for challenging new targets to cut drug related reoffending by 50 per cent over the decade and to treat twice as many addicts through the new National Treatment Agency, the new anti-drugs budget will be set at 870 million pounds in 2001-2002 and then rise to 931 million pounds and 996 million pounds by 2004, an average annual real growth rate of 10 per cent.</p> <p>Strengthening our local communities involves a new partnership with local government based on increased investment and new targets. The three year settlement for local government - an annual real terms rise of 3 per cent over and above inflation - will be set out in full by the Minister for Local Government. Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will make related announcements.</p> <p>Local and national Government need to work even more closely in a new partnership for reform and improvement in our poorest areas.</p> <p>For decades our whole country has been scarred by deep and persistent deprivation and under-achievement in our poorest communities.</p> <p>While much previous spending has been directed to dealing with the consequences of economic and social failure, it is time now to invest in tackling the causes of failure - poor school results, poorer standards of public health, and low levels of economic activity.</p> <p>Today, our poorest council estates suffer unemployment four times and burglary rates three times the national average, with mortality rates 30 per cent higher.</p> <p>These unjustifiable and divisive inequalities cannot be tolerated. Both government and communities must raise their sights, with a new target to raise the poorest areas up and thereby narrow the gap between these areas and the rest of the country.</p> <p>So we will not only extend the New Deal for Communities but strengthen the institutions - from our schools to our health centres - on which communities depend. In return for local public service agreements that require new minimum standards in school attainment, public health, law and order and job creation, a new Neighbourhood Renewal Fund will provide, by 2004, new resources worth 400 million pounds a year.</p> <p>In this spending round, housing - and our objective of decent affordable housing for all - will receive the priority it deserves, and resources it needs - an additional 1.6 billion pounds of new investment by 2004, a real terms rise averaging 12 per cent a year.</p> <p>Across the social sector, we will ensure that half a million more houses will be modernised or repaired, part of a ten year plan to eliminate all substandard housing. And as we implement key recommendations of the Rogers Report, reclaimed brown field sites will account for 60 per cent of all new housing, creating thousands of new construction jobs.</p> <p>Investment in the future must mean investment in a cleaner environment. To meet our climate change commitments the Environment Minister will announce how new resources will promote emissions trading and energy efficiency in Britain's homes, and there will be further announcements on the use of renewable energy and recycling by local authorities.</p> <p>In rural communities, the new Rural Transport Fund has extended the rural network with 2000 new or improved bus services. And the Rural Transport Fund will be increased from an annual allocation of 60 million pounds to 95 million pounds. And there will be an announcement of new finance available for maintaining the Post Office network in both rural and urban areas.</p> <p>And as farming restructures and deals with BSE and meets challenging targets to move from the old farm production subsidies to the new environmental improvement payments, the agriculture budget including the Intervention Board will increase from 1 billion pounds this year to 1.35 billion by 2004, an average annual real terms rise of 6 per cent. And the Food Standards Agency will see its budget rise from 87 million pounds this year to 111 million by 2004.</p> <p>Extending access, particularly for our young people, to the arts and to sport will strengthen every community.</p> <p>With a 4.3 per cent annual real terms rise in the budget of the Department of Culture, there will be significant improved funding for the arts and the Secretary of State will give details of new funding to encourage children to use our libraries, museums and arts and to encourage sports in schools and in our communities.</p> <p>Strengthening communities must involve strengthening our social services and our health service. Our NHS plans will be announced next week. There will also be a major package of investment in services for elderly people - including the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care. The Health Secretary will announce the detail of this and other allocations from the health and social services budget next week.</p> <p>I can also confirm that in the autumn the Government will publish its proposed plans for a new pensioner credit with a view to further announcements on a Budget timetable.</p> <p>The strong civic society we seek is built not by rights alone but by rights and responsibilities. So we will match our Budget tax reliefs to encourage the giving of money with new measures today to encourage the giving of time, extra resources of 60 million pounds by 2003-2004 with a clear aim - to encourage one million more of our citizens as volunteers in community service in our country.</p> <p>Madam Speaker</p> <p>I turn now to the investment we must make in our economic future. Britain has great strengths - the best place in Europe to do business, with world class companies in science and technology - but to build for the future , we must put in place the long term investment which is the precondition of a strong economy and of bridging the productivity gap with our competitors and avoid the short-termism of the past.</p> <p>Working with business, the role of modern Government is not to subsidise loss-makers, or to attempt to pick winners.</p> <p>The new role of Government is to invest in science and innovation, to promote competition, small business development and enterprise for all, to encourage balanced regional development and meet the pressing needs of transport and infrastructure and most of all to invest in the greatest driver of prosperity - education and skills.</p> <p>First, investment in science. With our investment in a one billion pound public private partnership with Wellcome to re-equip university science and extra resources to support pioneering medical research, we will raise the science budget by 5.4 per cent a year.</p> <p>And to ensure invention in Britain leads to manufacturing in Britain and jobs in Britain, the Secretary for Industry will announce new resources for the University Challenge Fund that commercialises inventions and for university-based Regional Enterprise Centres.</p> <p>Britain's small businesses are the backbone of our local economies. And to offer new services businesses have themselves requested, the budget of the new Small Business Service will rise substantially from 197 million pounds this year to 277 million pounds by 2004. This will include a national Internet service offering comprehensive business advice and a consultancy service for start-ups, worth up to 2,000 pounds for start ups in high unemployment areas. So that the numbers of small businesses who employ, which have already risen from 1.2 million in 1997 to 1.3 million, can expand in every area of the country.</p> <p>The newest and most decisive challenge in the new century demanding higher levels of investment is to master and lead in the new information technologies from the Internet to e-commerce.</p> <p>To make Britain best for electronic trading and to bridge the growing digital divide, the Review has agreed a three year programme of rapidly rising investment in our schools and our communities and a new fund the Prime Minister will announce to ensure that by 2005, Britain will have all Government services offered on line.</p> <p>Investment in innovation, infrastructure and skills is essential in every region if there is to be high levels of productivity in Britain and full employment throughout our country.</p> <p>To secure balanced regional development, Regional Development Agencies will receive new resources, their budgets increased by 500 million pounds a year by 2003-2004. There will not only be new funds but new flexibilities so that local people can promote local priorities and meet local needs they have themselves identified; in the North West promoting innovation and research; in the North East, increasing entrepreneurship; in Yorkshire and Humberside, small business development; in the East Midlands, information and communications technology; in the West Midlands, modern manufacturing; in the South East and South West, as in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with their devolved decision-making, the promotion of clusters of growth; in every region new support for skills, employment and for schools and colleges to promote enterprise open to all.</p> <p>The overall settlement for Scotland provides for an increase of 3.4 billion pounds a year by 2003-04, an annual real terms rise of 4.4 per cent. A separate announcement will be made by the Scottish Executive.</p> <p>For the Objective 1 areas in the UK - in Wales, Cornwall, Merseyside, South Yorkshire - and for Objective 2 and 3 areas I am announcing a new approach that will raise their levels of investment.</p> <p>Within our departmental allocations we are making today the Government will ensure funding for the European share of Objective 1, 2 and 3 projects.</p> <p>For EU structural funds this is estimated to total 4.2 billion pounds over three years, including an estimated total of 600 million for new Objective 1 programmes in English regions.</p> <p>The settlement increases funding for Wales by a total of 5.4 per cent a year in real terms and allows for match funding - and includes a special allocation to ensure funding of the European share of Wales' Objective 1 needs, an allocation to Wales of 80 million, 90 million, 102 million pounds over the next three years. I am also transferring management of the European Social Fund allocations for Wales of 149 million pounds over the next three years to the Welsh Assembly.</p> <p>It is because of the importance to all regions of modern transport and infrastructure that we will now make a step change in investment in public transport.</p> <p>Having in the Budget removed the automatic fuel escalator, extra money was allocated to roads and public transport this year. And now we are able to raise spending on roads and public transport by significant extra sums to meet the needs of business and the public, from 4.9 billion pounds this year to 6 billions next year, then to 7.4 billions and 9.1 billions in 2003-2004, a real terms rise of 20 per cent a year to 2004. Details of the targets to improve rail and bus services and to cut road congestion and of the allocation of funds will be set out in the Ten Year Plan published by the Deputy Prime Minister on Thursday.</p> <p>The modern economy can succeed only when it uses all the talent of all its people. Any potential squandered is a resource denied to the country's future. In this Review we allocate new funds to advance our goal of full employment.</p> <p>For 70,000 employers, nearly 500,000 young people and for Britain, which has seen long-term youth unemployment fall by 70 per cent, the New Deal has been succeeding, a central building block for our policy of full employment.</p> <p>So long-term youth unemployment which rose to 500,000 in the 1980s is 50,000 today.</p> <p>The Windfall Levy raised over 5 billion pounds with 1.6 billion allocated to schools, 3.5 billion to employment creation.</p> <p>Because the New Deal has been even more successful than forecast, with more getting back to work more quickly, there is an underspend, enabling us to fund the New Deal well into the next Parliament, and to transform what started as the New Deal for the young unemployed into a permanent deal for all long-term unemployed.</p> <p>Having helped 500,000 on the New Deal, we now set plans to help the next 500,000. Next year and until 2003, I expect 1.7 billion pounds to be available from the Windfall Levy to do more to coach the hard-to-employ young unemployed and to systematically create new opportunities for our long-term unemployed, nearly one million single parents and thousands of disabled men and women who want to work.</p> <p>To bring both child care and employment within the reach of more parents, child care investment will rise from 66 million pounds this year to 200 million by 2003-2004, as we deliver our national child care strategy.</p> <p>Because of our success in cutting unemployment social security spending, which grew by 4 per cent a year in the last Parliament, is growing by 1.5 per cent a year over the next three years and the budget for unemployment related benefits is falling.</p> <p>To make further social security savings by tackling fraud and error we are announcing new investment in staff and technology. Having cut errors in income support claims by half, we now plan to cut fraud and error in the job seekers allowance and income support payments, first by 25 per cent by 2004 and then 50 per cent.</p> <p>It is by continuing a prudent policy - economic stability, the New Deal, and tackling fraud and waste - that we are able to reallocate funds from unemployment and debt interest, to be used for our priorities in education and health.</p> <p>I turn now to investment to ensure all children have the best start in life. Today's children will be tomorrow's doctors, scientists, engineers and nurses - our future workforce. By investing in children, we are investing in our country's future.</p> <p>Having invested 7 billion pounds a year more in families - raising Child Benefit by 35 per cent to 15.50 pounds, guaranteeing a minimum family income under the Working Families Tax Credit and from next April the new Children's Tax Credit giving the typical family 442 pounds a year - it is time to take an additional step.</p> <p>The war against child poverty requires not only additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community. And it can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together.</p> <p>So in a unique initiative - and after consultations with charities and voluntary organisations - we will create a national Children's Fund with a budget over 3 years totalling 450 million pounds to help children and young people at risk.</p> <p>The Children's Fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations - secular and faith based - and support those dedicated staff and committed volunteers who offer one-to-one help to young people - and parents - at risk. 70 million pounds will be allocated to a network of 50 local and regional children's funds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/csr/story/0,2763,344689,00.html\">The rest of the speech</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The public spending allocations for 2001 to 2004 that I am announcing today are possible because - having eliminated the 28 billion pounds deficit we inherited and having reduced the national debt - the state of our public finances is strong. In the economic cycles of the last 30 years the current budget deficits averaged 109 billions pounds, the national debt doubled and rose to 44 per cent of national income in 1997 and stop-go in the economy meant stop-go in the public finances. So our first task was to create stability and sustainable public finances - and having set clear fiscal rules over the economic cycle - a current budget in balance, borrowing only to invest within prudent and cautious limits - today we not only have low inflation and stable growth but year-on-year current budget surpluses and debt falling below 40 per cent of national income. Indeed debt being repaid this year and next. And it is this sustained and sustainable improvement in our public finances that makes possible a sustained and sustainable improvement in our public services. Our second task was to encourage the work ethic and secure rising employment. And today with the assistance of the New Deal, unemployment is at its lowest for 20 years and almost 28 million people, more people than ever before are in work in our country today. Now, building on the foundation of stability and strengthened economic fundamentals, we can move to the next stage in creating a better future: - to make good the damage done by the legacy of decades of under-investment across our public services; - and to realise long-term national goals we have set for a decade - to close the productivity gap with our competitors, to deliver and sustain full employment, to secure higher education for a majority of our young people, to halve and then abolish child poverty and to build strong public services as we create a Britain where there is security and opportunity not just for a few but for everyone. And the first conclusion of this year's Spending Review is that prudent targeted long-term investment is not only a social good, but in a changing and often insecure world an economic necessity. It is only by investment in education, in science and in the future of our children that we can equip ourselves for future economic success and ensure there is opportunity for all. It is only by investing in health, transport, the environment and in law and order that we can ensure a more productive economy and security for all. And just as stability and economic strength makes possible investment, so too new investment reinforces stability and creates longer-term economic strength. So, while we will raise current expenditure only in line with our neutral view of trend growth - by 2. 5 per cent a year - we propose to tackle the long-term neglect of investment in our country with a step change in capital investment for education, science, health, policing and in our transport and infrastructure. As I announced in the Budget, net capital investment will more than double, rising from 7 billion pounds this year to 19 billions by 2004 , within a ceiling for public investment of 1.8 per cent of national income as we renew our public services. The second conclusion of our Spending Review is that it is by tying new resources to reform and results, and by locking in incentives, penalties, inspection and information that we ensure new investment goes to front line services: - in secondary as well as primary schools, new targets for literacy and numeracy and IT; - in hospitals, new systems of inspection; - in law and order, reforms to criminal justice; - in defence, implementing the next stage of the Strategic Defence Review; - with local government, new public service agreements; - in transport, a new partnership between private and public sector. At every stage money will be tied to output and performance. Let me give full details of the financial background. In the Budget I confirmed the current surpluses from 2000 onwards would be 14 billion pounds, 16,13, 8 and 8 billion pounds. My Budget also confirmed net borrowing will be minus 6.5, minus 5, plus 3, plus 11, plus 13 billion pounds, lower borrowing in every year than in any year of the last Parliament. I said that, as a share of national income, debt will be 35 per cent, 34, 33, 33, 33 and thus even with our programme of public investment we meet both our fiscal rules and do so even on the most cautious case and a cautious view of trend growth at 2.25 per cent. In accordance with the code of fiscal stability, I will publish the second fiscal forecasts of the year in the autumn. But I can already report that since the Budget the fiscal position has further strengthened. For the year ending March 2000, the current surplus is healthier than originally forecast at the time of the Budget. Not 17.1 billion, but 20.4 billion pounds. Debt as a share of GDP has been reduced even more, from 37.1 to 36.8 per cent. Indeed, I will use a further underspend of 2.5 billion pounds in annually managed expenditure to repay debt. Two billion pounds in departmental expenditure can be carried forward. However, on grounds of prudence, I have decided to allow a carry forward of only 1.5 billion pounds and to allow spending of only half of that this year and half next year - and to allocate the remaining half a billion to repay more debt. It is only because we have put the public finances on a sustainable footing that I can raise spending today. It is this same discipline that allows me to inform the House that this year we have repaid 6.2 billion pounds more debt than the 11.9 billion originally planned. In total a debt repayment of 18.1 billion pounds, the largest repayment of debt in any year since the War . Madam Speaker We have not and will not relax our discipline. So I have three policy announcements to underpin the strength of the public finances. Further limited sales of spectrum will take place by the end of 2001. And we will not repeat the mistakes of the North Sea Oil windfall and of the privatisation sales where receipts were immediately used up in current spending. I can confirm that all the capital proceeds will - as with the 22 billions from the first sale - go to further reduce the burden of debt. As debt is reduced so too are debt interest payments. And the first spectrum sale alone will reduce the bill for debt interest by a further 1 billion pounds a year by 2003-04. Money that - as I will confirm later this afternoon - will - year after year - go directly to improving public services. Second, departments and authorities will make asset and property sales of 4 billion pounds a year over the next three years - 4 billion a year released by realising unproductive assets we do not need to fund, service improvements we do need. And because money is tied to modernisation, the new public service agreements signed with departments - and for the first time with local government - will not only specify agreed outcomes but precise timetables for making necessary reforms. And I can tell the House, as a result of efficiency targets and a fall in the share of administration costs in total Government spending, new money makes possible a substantial shift in spending to the front line services - to recruit more nurses, doctors, teachers, classroom assistants, and police, more staff in our front line services. And with the success of the New Deal, the bills for social and economic failure are now 3.5 billion lower, enabling us to transfer 3.5 billion each year from paying unemployment benefits to funding public services. And with this improvement comes a radical shift in the composition of public spending. Our promise was to reduce the costs of failure - the bills for unemployment and debt interest - in order to reallocate money to the key public services. In the two decades from 1979 until 1997, rising debt interest and unemployment and social security accounted for 42 per cent of all extra public spending and that meant that 42 pence in every additional pound spent was not available to the key public services. In the coming three years, unemployment, social security and debt interest payments will account for not 42 per cent but now only 17 per cent of extra public spending, even as we direct more money to child benefit and the minimum income guarantee - and that leaves around 80 per cent of new money for health, education, transport, policing and other public services. Extra resources now available to us, not at the expense of our prudence, but because of our prudence. So within our fiscal rules and within the envelope I set in the Budget and have strictly adhered to, I can announce that spending on public services - what is called the departmental expenditure limit - is able to rise from 195 billion pounds this year and our previously planned 203 billion next year to 212.1 billions and then to 229 billions in 2002-2003 to 246 billions in 2003-2004. By 2004 an extra 43 billion pounds a year now to be allocated to front line services. Sustained improvements in public services now made possible because with stability and strengthened economic fundamentals, and lower debt interest and lower unemployment, we have sustained improvements in our public finances. So I now turn to the departmental allocations. In recent years, in addition to their conventional responsibilities, Britain's defence forces have taken on a new and valued role in international peacekeeping and in conflict prevention - promoting human rights and peace throughout the world including in Sierra Leone and Kosovo. To complete the restructuring agreed in the Strategic Defence Review - to fund new equipment and to increase the mobility and efficiency of our front line forces - defence spending, which has been falling in real terms every year since the end of the Cold War, will now increase in real terms. The allocations are 23.6 billion pounds next year rising to 25 billion in 2003-2004. The rise in the Foreign Office budget from 1.2 billion pounds next year to 1.32 billion in 2003-2004 will not only finance the proper representation and promotion of Britain abroad but also the Foreign Secretary is announcing today that the British Council will receive extra funds and the budget for the BBC World Service will rise substantially from 174 million pounds this year to 180 million pounds next year, to 210 million by the end of the period to achieve our new target of 153 million World Service listeners by 2002. Because we take seriously our international responsibilities to the environment - and following an interdepartmental review of nuclear safety - the Government is announcing today a special 85 million pound fund to assist nuclear clean up at Chernobyl. The international community's clearest duty and greatest challenge is to halve world poverty by 2015 and make primary education universal for every child. Our international aid budget will rise from 2.8 billion pounds this year to 3.1 billion next year, then 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion by 2004, a real terms rise of 6.2 per cent a year - in contrast to the falling share of national income devoted to overseas aid from 1979 to 1997, now a rising share of national income today and in the future, as we honour in full our commitment to debt relief, our obligation to the poorest countries of the world. I turn to our second set of decisions, new investment to build stronger communities. The Home Office budget will rise from 8.2 billion pounds this year to 9.6 billion next year, to 10.3 billion the year after, to 10.6 billion pounds in 2003-2004, an annual rise in real terms averaging 6.4 per cent a year. And tomorrow the Home Secretary will set out both his targets and how this allocation will be spent. To fully implement the Good Friday Agreement, an extra 316 million pounds over three years will help fund the modernisation of policing and criminal justice in Northern Ireland, and in this way help underpin peace and future prosperity. Every community in the land is weakened by the evil of drugs. In return for challenging new targets to cut drug related reoffending by 50 per cent over the decade and to treat twice as many addicts through the new National Treatment Agency, the new anti-drugs budget will be set at 870 million pounds in 2001-2002 and then rise to 931 million pounds and 996 million pounds by 2004, an average annual real growth rate of 10 per cent. Strengthening our local communities involves a new partnership with local government based on increased investment and new targets. The three year settlement for local government - an annual real terms rise of 3 per cent over and above inflation - will be set out in full by the Minister for Local Government. Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will make related announcements. Local and national Government need to work even more closely in a new partnership for reform and improvement in our poorest areas. For decades our whole country has been scarred by deep and persistent deprivation and under-achievement in our poorest communities. While much previous spending has been directed to dealing with the consequences of economic and social failure, it is time now to invest in tackling the causes of failure - poor school results, poorer standards of public health, and low levels of economic activity. Today, our poorest council estates suffer unemployment four times and burglary rates three times the national average, with mortality rates 30 per cent higher. These unjustifiable and divisive inequalities cannot be tolerated. Both government and communities must raise their sights, with a new target to raise the poorest areas up and thereby narrow the gap between these areas and the rest of the country. So we will not only extend the New Deal for Communities but strengthen the institutions - from our schools to our health centres - on which communities depend. In return for local public service agreements that require new minimum standards in school attainment, public health, law and order and job creation, a new Neighbourhood Renewal Fund will provide, by 2004, new resources worth 400 million pounds a year. In this spending round, housing - and our objective of decent affordable housing for all - will receive the priority it deserves, and resources it needs - an additional 1.6 billion pounds of new investment by 2004, a real terms rise averaging 12 per cent a year. Across the social sector, we will ensure that half a million more houses will be modernised or repaired, part of a ten year plan to eliminate all substandard housing. And as we implement key recommendations of the Rogers Report, reclaimed brown field sites will account for 60 per cent of all new housing, creating thousands of new construction jobs. Investment in the future must mean investment in a cleaner environment. To meet our climate change commitments the Environment Minister will announce how new resources will promote emissions trading and energy efficiency in Britain's homes, and there will be further announcements on the use of renewable energy and recycling by local authorities. In rural communities, the new Rural Transport Fund has extended the rural network with 2000 new or improved bus services. And the Rural Transport Fund will be increased from an annual allocation of 60 million pounds to 95 million pounds. And there will be an announcement of new finance available for maintaining the Post Office network in both rural and urban areas. And as farming restructures and deals with BSE and meets challenging targets to move from the old farm production subsidies to the new environmental improvement payments, the agriculture budget including the Intervention Board will increase from 1 billion pounds this year to 1.35 billion by 2004, an average annual real terms rise of 6 per cent. And the Food Standards Agency will see its budget rise from 87 million pounds this year to 111 million by 2004. Extending access, particularly for our young people, to the arts and to sport will strengthen every community. With a 4.3 per cent annual real terms rise in the budget of the Department of Culture, there will be significant improved funding for the arts and the Secretary of State will give details of new funding to encourage children to use our libraries, museums and arts and to encourage sports in schools and in our communities. Strengthening communities must involve strengthening our social services and our health service. Our NHS plans will be announced next week. There will also be a major package of investment in services for elderly people - including the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care. The Health Secretary will announce the detail of this and other allocations from the health and social services budget next week. I can also confirm that in the autumn the Government will publish its proposed plans for a new pensioner credit with a view to further announcements on a Budget timetable. The strong civic society we seek is built not by rights alone but by rights and responsibilities. So we will match our Budget tax reliefs to encourage the giving of money with new measures today to encourage the giving of time, extra resources of 60 million pounds by 2003-2004 with a clear aim - to encourage one million more of our citizens as volunteers in community service in our country. Madam Speaker I turn now to the investment we must make in our economic future. Britain has great strengths - the best place in Europe to do business, with world class companies in science and technology - but to build for the future , we must put in place the long term investment which is the precondition of a strong economy and of bridging the productivity gap with our competitors and avoid the short-termism of the past. Working with business, the role of modern Government is not to subsidise loss-makers, or to attempt to pick winners. The new role of Government is to invest in science and innovation, to promote competition, small business development and enterprise for all, to encourage balanced regional development and meet the pressing needs of transport and infrastructure and most of all to invest in the greatest driver of prosperity - education and skills. First, investment in science. With our investment in a one billion pound public private partnership with Wellcome to re-equip university science and extra resources to support pioneering medical research, we will raise the science budget by 5.4 per cent a year. And to ensure invention in Britain leads to manufacturing in Britain and jobs in Britain, the Secretary for Industry will announce new resources for the University Challenge Fund that commercialises inventions and for university-based Regional Enterprise Centres. Britain's small businesses are the backbone of our local economies. And to offer new services businesses have themselves requested, the budget of the new Small Business Service will rise substantially from 197 million pounds this year to 277 million pounds by 2004. This will include a national Internet service offering comprehensive business advice and a consultancy service for start-ups, worth up to 2,000 pounds for start ups in high unemployment areas. So that the numbers of small businesses who employ, which have already risen from 1.2 million in 1997 to 1.3 million, can expand in every area of the country. The newest and most decisive challenge in the new century demanding higher levels of investment is to master and lead in the new information technologies from the Internet to e-commerce. To make Britain best for electronic trading and to bridge the growing digital divide, the Review has agreed a three year programme of rapidly rising investment in our schools and our communities and a new fund the Prime Minister will announce to ensure that by 2005, Britain will have all Government services offered on line. Investment in innovation, infrastructure and skills is essential in every region if there is to be high levels of productivity in Britain and full employment throughout our country. To secure balanced regional development, Regional Development Agencies will receive new resources, their budgets increased by 500 million pounds a year by 2003-2004. There will not only be new funds but new flexibilities so that local people can promote local priorities and meet local needs they have themselves identified; in the North West promoting innovation and research; in the North East, increasing entrepreneurship; in Yorkshire and Humberside, small business development; in the East Midlands, information and communications technology; in the West Midlands, modern manufacturing; in the South East and South West, as in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with their devolved decision-making, the promotion of clusters of growth; in every region new support for skills, employment and for schools and colleges to promote enterprise open to all. The overall settlement for Scotland provides for an increase of 3.4 billion pounds a year by 2003-04, an annual real terms rise of 4.4 per cent. A separate announcement will be made by the Scottish Executive. For the Objective 1 areas in the UK - in Wales, Cornwall, Merseyside, South Yorkshire - and for Objective 2 and 3 areas I am announcing a new approach that will raise their levels of investment. Within our departmental allocations we are making today the Government will ensure funding for the European share of Objective 1, 2 and 3 projects. For EU structural funds this is estimated to total 4.2 billion pounds over three years, including an estimated total of 600 million for new Objective 1 programmes in English regions. The settlement increases funding for Wales by a total of 5.4 per cent a year in real terms and allows for match funding - and includes a special allocation to ensure funding of the European share of Wales' Objective 1 needs, an allocation to Wales of 80 million, 90 million, 102 million pounds over the next three years. I am also transferring management of the European Social Fund allocations for Wales of 149 million pounds over the next three years to the Welsh Assembly. It is because of the importance to all regions of modern transport and infrastructure that we will now make a step change in investment in public transport. Having in the Budget removed the automatic fuel escalator, extra money was allocated to roads and public transport this year. And now we are able to raise spending on roads and public transport by significant extra sums to meet the needs of business and the public, from 4.9 billion pounds this year to 6 billions next year, then to 7.4 billions and 9.1 billions in 2003-2004, a real terms rise of 20 per cent a year to 2004. Details of the targets to improve rail and bus services and to cut road congestion and of the allocation of funds will be set out in the Ten Year Plan published by the Deputy Prime Minister on Thursday. The modern economy can succeed only when it uses all the talent of all its people. Any potential squandered is a resource denied to the country's future. In this Review we allocate new funds to advance our goal of full employment. For 70,000 employers, nearly 500,000 young people and for Britain, which has seen long-term youth unemployment fall by 70 per cent, the New Deal has been succeeding, a central building block for our policy of full employment. So long-term youth unemployment which rose to 500,000 in the 1980s is 50,000 today. The Windfall Levy raised over 5 billion pounds with 1.6 billion allocated to schools, 3.5 billion to employment creation. Because the New Deal has been even more successful than forecast, with more getting back to work more quickly, there is an underspend, enabling us to fund the New Deal well into the next Parliament, and to transform what started as the New Deal for the young unemployed into a permanent deal for all long-term unemployed. Having helped 500,000 on the New Deal, we now set plans to help the next 500,000. Next year and until 2003, I expect 1.7 billion pounds to be available from the Windfall Levy to do more to coach the hard-to-employ young unemployed and to systematically create new opportunities for our long-term unemployed, nearly one million single parents and thousands of disabled men and women who want to work. To bring both child care and employment within the reach of more parents, child care investment will rise from 66 million pounds this year to 200 million by 2003-2004, as we deliver our national child care strategy. Because of our success in cutting unemployment social security spending, which grew by 4 per cent a year in the last Parliament, is growing by 1.5 per cent a year over the next three years and the budget for unemployment related benefits is falling. To make further social security savings by tackling fraud and error we are announcing new investment in staff and technology. Having cut errors in income support claims by half, we now plan to cut fraud and error in the job seekers allowance and income support payments, first by 25 per cent by 2004 and then 50 per cent. It is by continuing a prudent policy - economic stability, the New Deal, and tackling fraud and waste - that we are able to reallocate funds from unemployment and debt interest, to be used for our priorities in education and health. I turn now to investment to ensure all children have the best start in life. Today's children will be tomorrow's doctors, scientists, engineers and nurses - our future workforce. By investing in children, we are investing in our country's future. Having invested 7 billion pounds a year more in families - raising Child Benefit by 35 per cent to 15.50 pounds, guaranteeing a minimum family income under the Working Families Tax Credit and from next April the new Children's Tax Credit giving the typical family 442 pounds a year - it is time to take an additional step. The war against child poverty requires not only additional cash but the support and encouragement of all forces of care and compassion in every community. And it can only be won by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together. So in a unique initiative - and after consultations with charities and voluntary organisations - we will create a national Children's Fund with a budget over 3 years totalling 450 million pounds to help children and young people at risk. The Children's Fund will work with national children's charities and local community organisations - secular and faith based - and support those dedicated staff and committed volunteers who offer one-to-one help to young people - and parents - at risk. 70 million pounds will be allocated to a network of 50 local and regional children's funds. The rest of the speech",

      "body": "<p>Press releases in science seem to jump the gun more and more these days. First the groups running the human genome project announce its completion with only 97% of two (conflicting) rough drafts in the bag; now we are told that a male pill, effective and free from side effects, could be with us in five years. </p> <p>Five years feels like a long time for something that is already a suspicious 35 years behind the female pill - and in fact wasn't it about three years ago that we were told we were about three years away from the male pill being on the market? Why are we still waiting? </p> <p>The traditional answer is that an ovary making one egg once a month presents a much easier target to hit pharmacologically than a testicle making a thousand sperm a minute. And maybe there is no gender bias - maybe you really do need to get the big guns out for the testicles - which, of course, is every man's fear. </p> <p>Previous attempts at the male pill have suffered from dismal side effects: impotence, reduced libido, acne, mood swings, high blood pressure and, most terrifyingly, shrinking testicles. If some of these sound similar to the side effects of the female pill, it is because most of them have included similar progesterone based hormones, such as desogestrel, along with (perhaps more reassuringly) testosterone. </p> <p>There are, of course, dangers to using any new drug - it takes a few years for the less common effects of a new drug to be noted - and it's important to remember that the side effect profile of this male pill was announced after 60 men took it for six months. That may be enough time to spot any obvious disasters and a reasonable size for preliminary research, but it's far too early to announce the pill a success. </p> <p>So this is how the next five years will be spent - trying the drug on larger and larger numbers, watching for adverse effects, and fine tuning the ingredients to make the pill more palatable to men. But even when its safety has been proven, and it has been shown to reduce the sperm count to nil, will men actually take it? </p> <p>With the psychosexual baggage that goes along with fertility, which all the safety data in the world could not carry away, it's hard to imagine anyone but the most new of new men taking this pill. A recent poll in Edinburgh found that two thirds of men questioned would take the pill if it was free from side effects. But do you seriously believe that? </p> <p>It's quite revealing to look at what actually happens in the case of sterilisation. Despite vasectomies being safer, easier to perform, and 10 times less likely to result in accidental pregnancy than female sterilisation, every year more women have the snip than men. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because vasectomies are not always reversible (and you never know when you might be called upon to repopulate the earth after global nuclear holocaust). But even if they're queueing round the block for the male pill, there's one other major hurdle, and it could be the killer. If many women can't trust themselves to remember to take their pill at the same time every day, will they trust men to do it? A woman has a fairly solid motive for remembering; men may have a fairly solid motive for keeping quiet when they forget.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Press releases in science seem to jump the gun more and more these days. First the groups running the human genome project announce its completion with only 97% of two (conflicting) rough drafts in the bag; now we are told that a male pill, effective and free from side effects, could be with us in five years. Five years feels like a long time for something that is already a suspicious 35 years behind the female pill - and in fact wasn't it about three years ago that we were told we were about three years away from the male pill being on the market? Why are we still waiting? The traditional answer is that an ovary making one egg once a month presents a much easier target to hit pharmacologically than a testicle making a thousand sperm a minute. And maybe there is no gender bias - maybe you really do need to get the big guns out for the testicles - which, of course, is every man's fear. Previous attempts at the male pill have suffered from dismal side effects: impotence, reduced libido, acne, mood swings, high blood pressure and, most terrifyingly, shrinking testicles. If some of these sound similar to the side effects of the female pill, it is because most of them have included similar progesterone based hormones, such as desogestrel, along with (perhaps more reassuringly) testosterone. There are, of course, dangers to using any new drug - it takes a few years for the less common effects of a new drug to be noted - and it's important to remember that the side effect profile of this male pill was announced after 60 men took it for six months. That may be enough time to spot any obvious disasters and a reasonable size for preliminary research, but it's far too early to announce the pill a success. So this is how the next five years will be spent - trying the drug on larger and larger numbers, watching for adverse effects, and fine tuning the ingredients to make the pill more palatable to men. But even when its safety has been proven, and it has been shown to reduce the sperm count to nil, will men actually take it? With the psychosexual baggage that goes along with fertility, which all the safety data in the world could not carry away, it's hard to imagine anyone but the most new of new men taking this pill. A recent poll in Edinburgh found that two thirds of men questioned would take the pill if it was free from side effects. But do you seriously believe that? It's quite revealing to look at what actually happens in the case of sterilisation. Despite vasectomies being safer, easier to perform, and 10 times less likely to result in accidental pregnancy than female sterilisation, every year more women have the snip than men. Perhaps it's because vasectomies are not always reversible (and you never know when you might be called upon to repopulate the earth after global nuclear holocaust). But even if they're queueing round the block for the male pill, there's one other major hurdle, and it could be the killer. If many women can't trust themselves to remember to take their pill at the same time every day, will they trust men to do it? A woman has a fairly solid motive for remembering; men may have a fairly solid motive for keeping quiet when they forget.",

      "body": "<p>Bill Foxen describes it as like watching a fast camera shutter opening and closing in his head. Without warning, the muscles at the back of the eyes would begin to twitch and his lenses start flickering rapidly. When the attack came, there was nothing he could do to stop the maddening sight of the world flashing on and off, except close his eyes. Effectively, he was blind. </p> <p>\"I spent a weekend in Budapest with my wife and I had to spend the whole time lying on the bed with my eyes shut,\" he says. </p> <p>Worse, with equal suddenness, he would lose all power over his arms and legs. One attack saw him paralysed in a neurological ward for six weeks, with a further three months recuperation. </p> <p>Such is the fearful power and unpredictability of multiple sclerosis in its \"relapsing, remitting\" form. An MS sufferer can be fit and well, leading a normal work and family life, and wake up one morning blind or paralysed or both. </p> <p>Attacks also bring incontinence, depression, exhaustion, sexual dysfunction, difficulty in thinking clearly, mood changes and much, much pain. During an attack, the muscles of the vocal chords fail to work properly, and sufferers slur their words like drunks. </p> <p>This was the dark world Foxen inhabited, the world he unwittingly entered at 17 when an optician giving him a routine sight test noticed a flickering in his eye. Where, throughout his student days, he put occasional epsiodes of numbness in his legs down to a trapped nerve. Where at the age of 27, a qualified architect, he was told he had the disease, and eight years later gave up lying to his boss, admitted he had MS, and quit to prepare for eventual life in a wheelchair. </p> <p>Now 44, he has left that world behind, thanks to a remarkable drug called beta interferon. It's a drug which, he believes, has been responsible for transforming his life: his relapses have gone from two or three a year to none, he plays badminton, he looks after his children while his wife is at work, he's an active volunteer at the citizen's advice bureau, and he's using his architectural knowledge to advise a disabled access group. </p> <p>Beta interferon isn't a cure for MS, which affects 85,000 people in Britain, but it is the best hope sufferers have of leading normal lives, of staving off permanent disability and dependence, albeit for a limited time. In North America and continental Europe, where the drug has been widely prescribed for years, the health authorities certainly think so. </p> <p>But not the health authorities in Britain. Beta interferon is expensive, costing about \u00a310,000 a year per patient. The MS Society, the leading MS charity, estimates that about 10,000 sufferers would be candidates for treatment. The arithmetic isn't difficult: a cost to the health service of \u00a3100m a year, every year, until a better drug comes along. And the government's national institute for clinical excellence (Nice), which is mulling over whether the NHS should or shouldn't pay for it, doesn't seem to think it's worth the money. </p> <p>Nice has yet to make its final decision, due in August. But last month a leak of the agency's provisional opinion revealed that the assessors were against it. </p> <p>Shortly after the leak, Nice's chairman, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, said beta interferon was failing their value for money test: \"Other than for those patients who are already receiving these medicines, they should not be made available in the NHS at the present time. This is because, on the basis of a very careful consideration of the evidence, their modest clinical benefit appears to be outweighed by their very high cost.\" </p> <p>Outraged, the MS Society, standing for a powerful constituency, given that an estimated quarter of a million sufferers, carers and relatives have their lives affected by the disease in some way, accused Nice of failing to listen to testimony from the few British MS sufferers who have been given access to the drug so far, and from the many more who believe they should be given it. On the NHS today, access to beta interferon varies wildly according to where you happen to live, a classic example of postcode prescribing. </p> <p>\"The proposal as it stands is brutal and indefensible,\" the society says. \"The idea that those who have been lucky enough to receive the drug will continue to enjoy its benefits while others go on suffering sets the postcode lottery in stone. It makes a complete mockery of the government's commitment to equality of access to health care.\" </p> <p>David Harrison, a society spokesman, told the Guardian: \"Our principal concern is that this is a drug which quite clearly works. It may not work 100%, but what drug does? It's the only one available.\" </p> <p>Multiple sclerosis turns the sufferer's body against itself. In the biochemical equivalent of a friendly fire incident, when troops open fire on their own side by mistake, the body's defence mechanism, its immune system, turns on one of the most critical areas it is supposed to defend: the axons - channels which radiate out from nerve cells, carrying signals. Specifically, the immune system attacks myelin, a fatty substance which sheathes the axons like plastic round a copper wire. The axons experience a kind of short circuit: eventually, the damaged myelin is replaced by scar-like tissue. The brain andnervous system begin to break down. </p> <p>Back in the 1980s, scientists discovered that a substance called gamma interferon, which normally works to rally the immune system against viral invaders, appeared to be implicated in MS: its presence in sufferers shot up before and during attacks. They turned to a cousin substance, beta interferon, which inhibits the action of gamma interferon. The results were promising and in 1993 the US food and drug administration approved the use of artificially synthesised beta interferon as a treatment for relapsing, remitting MS. </p> <p>In North America and continental Europe, 12-16% of MS patients are prescribed the drug. In the UK, the figure is 3%. The beta interferon debacle is another reminder of how far the NHS has fallen below its peers in terms of funding, and it is likely that Nice is simply obliged to apply a tougher set of cost-effectiveness criteria than its counterparts across the Atlantic and over the Channel. </p> <p>Yet are the necessarily ugly calculations of the health economists, replete with miserable sums trying to put a financial value on the alleviation of pain, dependency and disability, being applied fairly and sensibly by Nice? Beta interferon advocates - patient groups, drugs companies and doctors - say they are not. </p> <p>They say Nice is basing its rejection of beta interferon - modest clinical benefits outweighed by cost - on a crude measure based on the immediate, observable effects on MS patients' health during two-year clinical trials of the drug in the 1990s. Yet in other countries, the health authorities have assumed the drug would be taken for much longer. Not only would it improve quality of life over as much as a decade, it would in all probability stave off the onset of permanent disability. </p> <p>The accusation is that Nice is behaving like a short-sighted car fleet manager who refuses to replace spare parts in problem cars, as long as the cars are running - until the cars suffer a catastrophic breakdown and it is too late. But MS sufferers are human beings, not cars. </p> <p>Dr Jonathan O'Riordan, director of the MS research unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, says that the immediate, observable effects of beta interferon in clinical trials were clear. Patients' attacks happened one third less often, and were half as severe. This is the \"moderate\" effect which Nice considers too expensive at \u00a310,000 a year for people who are not, strictly speaking, disabled. </p> <p>But there is another, hidden effect of beta interferon. Studying MS patients, doctors take MRI scans of their brain. They have discovered that the attacks experienced by relapsing remitting sufferers show only a fraction - one tenth - of the civil war raging in the brain between the immune system and nerve cells. </p> <p>And regardless of what a patient experiences, after three years the MRI scans show that those who have not taken beta interferon have a 25 % increase in the area of nerve damage. Those who have taken the drug show no increase in nerve damage at all - a dramatic, rather than a \"moderate\" effect. </p> <p>\"The Americans and the Europeans and a lot of people in the UK think the dramatic effect seen in the MRI scans is very significant, and does mean patients will probably be better off in the long term,\" says O'Riordan. </p> <p>\"That's why everybody in America and Europe gets it. But some people in the UK are just looking at the clinical effects on the attacks you see, as opposed to the attacks you don't.\" </p> <p>Despite last month's leak, Nice is sticking to its insistence that details of its interferon study remain secret until a final decision has been made. The agency must now be regretting its decision to bow to the demands of the drugs companies for its reviews to be confidential, since it has gagged itself while everyone else involved in the consultation - including the drugs companies - is free to speak out. </p> <p> Last week one of the manufacturers of beta interferon, the US biotech firm Biogen, trumpeted research it had commissioned from a \"health outcomes\" analyst, Dr Malcolm Kendrick, which suggested that if beta interferon was taken over a number of years it would be far more cost effective than previous studies suggested. If lower social costs were taken into account - if it was assumed that beta interferon beneficiaries would be able to work, pay taxes and remain free of dependency on carers for longer - the drug paid for itself. </p> <p>There is a tension between the MS Society and firms such as Biogen; the society believes the drugs companies are charging too much for beta interferon in this country. The price is the same in each country - 10,000 - but in the US it's 10,000 dollars, in the UK 10,000 pounds. Still, Harrison backs the conclusions of the Biogen study. </p> <p>\"If it were proved that by getting at MS fairly early in the day people were able to remain in work, go on living a reasonably normal existence for a longer time than expected to and make a contribution to the economy through taxes, it would overturn the Nice conclusions,\" he says. \"You can't just look at one enormous end of the bar chart with nothing to balance it.\" </p> <p>Anne-Toni Rodgers of Nice would not comment on the agency's deliberations, saying only that \"economic modelling is quite a challenging thing to do and does depend on the validity of the assumptions\". She did point out that, in its short history, Nice has already changed its mind from provisional to final decision. </p> <p>Until next month, then, MS sufferers are in limbo, and the struggle for what beta interferon is available on the NHS goes on. Scotland is not subject to Nice - another agency is about to do a cost-benefit study of beta interferon there - but O'Riordan's problem nicely illustrates the discrepancies of prescribing across the UK. </p> <p>In Tayside region, where he is based, the health authority will pay for the drug to be prescribed to exactly seven patients, out of hundreds eligible. In Grampian and Fife, there is no set limit to numbers; in Glasgow and Edinburgh, no one gets beta interferon on the NHS. </p> <p>\"We're left with many patients who would benefit who aren't getting it,\" says O'Riordan. \"My own opinion is that it's beneficial. If I had multiple sclerosis, I'd prefer to be on it.\"</p>",

Worse, with equal suddenness, he would lose all power over his arms and legs. One attack saw him paralysed in a neurological ward for six weeks, with a further three months recuperation. Such is the fearful power and unpredictability of multiple sclerosis in its \"relapsing, remitting\" form. An MS sufferer can be fit and well, leading a normal work and family life, and wake up one morning blind or paralysed or both. Attacks also bring incontinence, depression, exhaustion, sexual dysfunction, difficulty in thinking clearly, mood changes and much, much pain. During an attack, the muscles of the vocal chords fail to work properly, and sufferers slur their words like drunks. This was the dark world Foxen inhabited, the world he unwittingly entered at 17 when an optician giving him a routine sight test noticed a flickering in his eye. Where, throughout his student days, he put occasional epsiodes of numbness in his legs down to a trapped nerve. Where at the age of 27, a qualified architect, he was told he had the disease, and eight years later gave up lying to his boss, admitted he had MS, and quit to prepare for eventual life in a wheelchair. Now 44, he has left that world behind, thanks to a remarkable drug called beta interferon. It's a drug which, he believes, has been responsible for transforming his life: his relapses have gone from two or three a year to none, he plays badminton, he looks after his children while his wife is at work, he's an active volunteer at the citizen's advice bureau, and he's using his architectural knowledge to advise a disabled access group. Beta interferon isn't a cure for MS, which affects 85,000 people in Britain, but it is the best hope sufferers have of leading normal lives, of staving off permanent disability and dependence, albeit for a limited time. In North America and continental Europe, where the drug has been widely prescribed for years, the health authorities certainly think so. But not the health authorities in Britain. Beta interferon is expensive, costing about \u00a310,000 a year per patient. The MS Society, the leading MS charity, estimates that about 10,000 sufferers would be candidates for treatment. The arithmetic isn't difficult: a cost to the health service of \u00a3100m a year, every year, until a better drug comes along. And the government's national institute for clinical excellence (Nice), which is mulling over whether the NHS should or shouldn't pay for it, doesn't seem to think it's worth the money. Nice has yet to make its final decision, due in August. But last month a leak of the agency's provisional opinion revealed that the assessors were against it. Shortly after the leak, Nice's chairman, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, said beta interferon was failing their value for money test: \"Other than for those patients who are already receiving these medicines, they should not be made available in the NHS at the present time. This is because, on the basis of a very careful consideration of the evidence, their modest clinical benefit appears to be outweighed by their very high cost.\" Outraged, the MS Society, standing for a powerful constituency, given that an estimated quarter of a million sufferers, carers and relatives have their lives affected by the disease in some way, accused Nice of failing to listen to testimony from the few British MS sufferers who have been given access to the drug so far, and from the many more who believe they should be given it. On the NHS today, access to beta interferon varies wildly according to where you happen to live, a classic example of postcode prescribing. \"The proposal as it stands is brutal and indefensible,\" the society says. \"The idea that those who have been lucky enough to receive the drug will continue to enjoy its benefits while others go on suffering sets the postcode lottery in stone. It makes a complete mockery of the government's commitment to equality of access to health care.\" David Harrison, a society spokesman, told the Guardian: \"Our principal concern is that this is a drug which quite clearly works. It may not work 100%, but what drug does? It's the only one available.\" Multiple sclerosis turns the sufferer's body against itself. In the biochemical equivalent of a friendly fire incident, when troops open fire on their own side by mistake, the body's defence mechanism, its immune system, turns on one of the most critical areas it is supposed to defend: the axons - channels which radiate out from nerve cells, carrying signals. Specifically, the immune system attacks myelin, a fatty substance which sheathes the axons like plastic round a copper wire. The axons experience a kind of short circuit: eventually, the damaged myelin is replaced by scar-like tissue. The brain andnervous system begin to break down. Back in the 1980s, scientists discovered that a substance called gamma interferon, which normally works to rally the immune system against viral invaders, appeared to be implicated in MS: its presence in sufferers shot up before and during attacks. They turned to a cousin substance, beta interferon, which inhibits the action of gamma interferon. The results were promising and in 1993 the US food and drug administration approved the use of artificially synthesised beta interferon as a treatment for relapsing, remitting MS. In North America and continental Europe, 12-16% of MS patients are prescribed the drug. In the UK, the figure is 3%. The beta interferon debacle is another reminder of how far the NHS has fallen below its peers in terms of funding, and it is likely that Nice is simply obliged to apply a tougher set of cost-effectiveness criteria than its counterparts across the Atlantic and over the Channel. Yet are the necessarily ugly calculations of the health economists, replete with miserable sums trying to put a financial value on the alleviation of pain, dependency and disability, being applied fairly and sensibly by Nice? Beta interferon advocates - patient groups, drugs companies and doctors - say they are not. They say Nice is basing its rejection of beta interferon - modest clinical benefits outweighed by cost - on a crude measure based on the immediate, observable effects on MS patients' health during two-year clinical trials of the drug in the 1990s. Yet in other countries, the health authorities have assumed the drug would be taken for much longer. Not only would it improve quality of life over as much as a decade, it would in all probability stave off the onset of permanent disability. The accusation is that Nice is behaving like a short-sighted car fleet manager who refuses to replace spare parts in problem cars, as long as the cars are running - until the cars suffer a catastrophic breakdown and it is too late. But MS sufferers are human beings, not cars. Dr Jonathan O'Riordan, director of the MS research unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, says that the immediate, observable effects of beta interferon in clinical trials were clear. Patients' attacks happened one third less often, and were half as severe. This is the \"moderate\" effect which Nice considers too expensive at \u00a310,000 a year for people who are not, strictly speaking, disabled. But there is another, hidden effect of beta interferon. Studying MS patients, doctors take MRI scans of their brain. They have discovered that the attacks experienced by relapsing remitting sufferers show only a fraction - one tenth - of the civil war raging in the brain between the immune system and nerve cells. And regardless of what a patient experiences, after three years the MRI scans show that those who have not taken beta interferon have a 25 % increase in the area of nerve damage. Those who have taken the drug show no increase in nerve damage at all - a dramatic, rather than a \"moderate\" effect. \"The Americans and the Europeans and a lot of people in the UK think the dramatic effect seen in the MRI scans is very significant, and does mean patients will probably be better off in the long term,\" says O'Riordan. \"That's why everybody in America and Europe gets it. But some people in the UK are just looking at the clinical effects on the attacks you see, as opposed to the attacks you don't.\" Despite last month's leak, Nice is sticking to its insistence that details of its interferon study remain secret until a final decision has been made. The agency must now be regretting its decision to bow to the demands of the drugs companies for its reviews to be confidential, since it has gagged itself while everyone else involved in the consultation - including the drugs companies - is free to speak out. Last week one of the manufacturers of beta interferon, the US biotech firm Biogen, trumpeted research it had commissioned from a \"health outcomes\" analyst, Dr Malcolm Kendrick, which suggested that if beta interferon was taken over a number of years it would be far more cost effective than previous studies suggested. If lower social costs were taken into account - if it was assumed that beta interferon beneficiaries would be able to work, pay taxes and remain free of dependency on carers for longer - the drug paid for itself. There is a tension between the MS Society and firms such as Biogen; the society believes the drugs companies are charging too much for beta interferon in this country. The price is the same in each country - 10,000 - but in the US it's 10,000 dollars, in the UK 10,000 pounds. Still, Harrison backs the conclusions of the Biogen study. \"If it were proved that by getting at MS fairly early in the day people were able to remain in work, go on living a reasonably normal existence for a longer time than expected to and make a contribution to the economy through taxes, it would overturn the Nice conclusions,\" he says. \"You can't just look at one enormous end of the bar chart with nothing to balance it.\" Anne-Toni Rodgers of Nice would not comment on the agency's deliberations, saying only that \"economic modelling is quite a challenging thing to do and does depend on the validity of the assumptions\". She did point out that, in its short history, Nice has already changed its mind from provisional to final decision. Until next month, then, MS sufferers are in limbo, and the struggle for what beta interferon is available on the NHS goes on. Scotland is not subject to Nice - another agency is about to do a cost-benefit study of beta interferon there - but O'Riordan's problem nicely illustrates the discrepancies of prescribing across the UK. In Tayside region, where he is based, the health authority will pay for the drug to be prescribed to exactly seven patients, out of hundreds eligible. In Grampian and Fife, there is no set limit to numbers; in Glasgow and Edinburgh, no one gets beta interferon on the NHS. \"We're left with many patients who would benefit who aren't getting it,\" says O'Riordan. \"My own opinion is that it's beneficial. If I had multiple sclerosis, I'd prefer to be on it.\"",

He has played safe, massively boosting spending on public transport, which is popular with voters, but steering clear of trickier green measures such as compulsory recycling, which might upset them.</p> <p>If the latest Guardian/ICM poll is an accurate measure, the issues we are most concerned about are education, health, economy, transport, tax and crime. These are what we vote on.</p> <p>Occasionally, the nation is incensed by a health scandal - BSE, or asthma, or cancer cure figures. Sometimes a scientist holds centre stage, forecasting an era in which grapes flourish in the home counties or the fens sink into the sea. But, at best, we classify environmental problems as problems of public health or transport - and at worse, we dismiss them as science fiction.</p> <p>Gordon Brown seems to have upheld the brief set out by Tony Blair in a memo leaked last weekend. The prime minister's concerns were that his government was seen to be \"out of touch with gut British instincts\".</p> <p>His solution was to launch some \"eye-catching initiatives\" and to \"personally associate\" himself with \"as much of this as possible\". The key areas he outlined were family, asylum, crime, Europe and foreign policy.</p> <p>Mr Blair is a desperate populist. He is still avid, after all the heckles and slow-clapping, to be loved by his people. If the \"gut instincts\" of Britain were environmentalist, then have no doubt Mr Blair would be penning memos demanding \"eye-catching initiatives\" on public transport, climate change, pesticide use, pollution of the seas, loss of wildlife and noxious fumes in cities.</p> <p>This government has pretty faithfully mirrored public diffidence about the environment. It has stated itself to be pro-environment, but done much less than it ought to.</p> <p>In fact, the government could have done much less. It has committed itself to an impressive, if still inadequate reduction in carbon emissions (a cut of 20% by the year 2010), making Britain a leading force in global emissions policy-making.</p> <p>Environment minister Michael Meacher has set a target for eventual cuts of 60-70% by 2050. Mr Blair has called for British business to lead the way in developing low-carbon technologies.</p> <p>The government has produced a wildlife bill which protects animals and delivers the right to roam, which environmentalists had long campaigned for. Certain types of blood sport, including fox hunting, have received a mild governmental drubbing, though no legislation has been passed.</p> <p>But the government looks undecided and lethargic. Public transport remains sufficiently farcical and capricious to keep us a petrol-guzzling nation, despite heavy fuel taxes. Mr Blair recently revealed that these fuel taxes were intended to fund the health service - which is either the truth, or an attempt to persuade people to accept them without mentioning the less eye-catching subject of environmentalism.</p> <p>Green electricity initiatives are in their infancy. Japan, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands are all racing ahead of us, cornering the markets for wind and biomas fuel generation, while the British government continues to subsidise the coal industry.

      "bodyText": "It should be no surprise that Gordon Brown has offered comparatively little to environmental causes. He has played safe, massively boosting spending on public transport, which is popular with voters, but steering clear of trickier green measures such as compulsory recycling, which might upset them. If the latest Guardian/ICM poll is an accurate measure, the issues we are most concerned about are education, health, economy, transport, tax and crime. These are what we vote on. Occasionally, the nation is incensed by a health scandal - BSE, or asthma, or cancer cure figures. Sometimes a scientist holds centre stage, forecasting an era in which grapes flourish in the home counties or the fens sink into the sea. But, at best, we classify environmental problems as problems of public health or transport - and at worse, we dismiss them as science fiction. Gordon Brown seems to have upheld the brief set out by Tony Blair in a memo leaked last weekend. The prime minister's concerns were that his government was seen to be \"out of touch with gut British instincts\". His solution was to launch some \"eye-catching initiatives\" and to \"personally associate\" himself with \"as much of this as possible\". The key areas he outlined were family, asylum, crime, Europe and foreign policy. Mr Blair is a desperate populist. He is still avid, after all the heckles and slow-clapping, to be loved by his people. If the \"gut instincts\" of Britain were environmentalist, then have no doubt Mr Blair would be penning memos demanding \"eye-catching initiatives\" on public transport, climate change, pesticide use, pollution of the seas, loss of wildlife and noxious fumes in cities. This government has pretty faithfully mirrored public diffidence about the environment. It has stated itself to be pro-environment, but done much less than it ought to. In fact, the government could have done much less. It has committed itself to an impressive, if still inadequate reduction in carbon emissions (a cut of 20% by the year 2010), making Britain a leading force in global emissions policy-making. Environment minister Michael Meacher has set a target for eventual cuts of 60-70% by 2050. Mr Blair has called for British business to lead the way in developing low-carbon technologies. The government has produced a wildlife bill which protects animals and delivers the right to roam, which environmentalists had long campaigned for. Certain types of blood sport, including fox hunting, have received a mild governmental drubbing, though no legislation has been passed. But the government looks undecided and lethargic. Public transport remains sufficiently farcical and capricious to keep us a petrol-guzzling nation, despite heavy fuel taxes. Mr Blair recently revealed that these fuel taxes were intended to fund the health service - which is either the truth, or an attempt to persuade people to accept them without mentioning the less eye-catching subject of environmentalism. Green electricity initiatives are in their infancy. Japan, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands are all racing ahead of us, cornering the markets for wind and biomas fuel generation, while the British government continues to subsidise the coal industry. Sellafield remains an under-controlled monstrosity, its reprocessed fuel pellets recently deemed too suspect to be bought by their Japanese customers. Britain was recently one of only two countries (the other being France) who abstained on a vote to phase out nuclear reprocessing. The proposal was passed 12-0. Council recycling provisions are at a more primitive level than those of New York, where every house is given different bins for different substances and multi-lingual educational adverts are placed on the subway. The Tory-created deadline to recycle 25% of our waste by the year 2000 has been exceeded. We recycle only 6% of waste. This makes us one of the most incinerator-belching, landfill-amassing countries in Europe.

Some 90% of our customers think in imperial. They tell us that when it comes to size, imperial matters. We're not anti-Europe, but we are pro-shopper.\"</p> <p>The company said its research indicated that more than half its customers found metric weights confusing, and three-quarters would like imperial measures displayed.</p> <p>Its online shopping arm had revealed misordering such as a customer ordering 3kg of broccoli (weighing 6.6lb) rather than 3lb as intended and another ordering 9kg of potatoes (19.8lb) rather than 9lb.</p> <p>But Tesco is sticking within a European law that since January has required all goods to be priced in metric at tills. These were changed in most grocers years ago when other foods went metric. It is also obeying British requirements that labelling at shelf edges does not give greater prominence to imperial measures than to metric.</p> <p>\"We would never drop metric,\" said the company. \"All kids have been educated in metric, but a large part of the population was not.\"</p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry welcomed the move: \"We are very keen that retailers play their part in helping customers.\"</p> <p>Tony Allen, of the trading standards institute, said: \"It is a very clever bit of publicity.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is bringing back pounds and ounces for much of its food produce. Much of the in-store advertising at Britain's biggest supermarket chain will not even mention metric weights, while its own-brand packaged foods will display metric and imperial measures in equal size. Tesco will also give prices calculated in old-style weight the same prominence as kilos and grams on shelves and at deli, meat and fish counters. Rivals yesterday were considering the move, while the government and trading standards officials were marvelling at a publicity stunt that met the letter of British and European law but gave the impression of defending tradition. Tesco's marketing director, Tim Mason, said: \"It is time to turn the scales in favour of the British customer. Some 90% of our customers think in imperial. They tell us that when it comes to size, imperial matters. We're not anti-Europe, but we are pro-shopper.\" The company said its research indicated that more than half its customers found metric weights confusing, and three-quarters would like imperial measures displayed. Its online shopping arm had revealed misordering such as a customer ordering 3kg of broccoli (weighing 6.6lb) rather than 3lb as intended and another ordering 9kg of potatoes (19.8lb) rather than 9lb. But Tesco is sticking within a European law that since January has required all goods to be priced in metric at tills. These were changed in most grocers years ago when other foods went metric. It is also obeying British requirements that labelling at shelf edges does not give greater prominence to imperial measures than to metric. \"We would never drop metric,\" said the company. \"All kids have been educated in metric, but a large part of the population was not.\" The Department of Trade and Industry welcomed the move: \"We are very keen that retailers play their part in helping customers.\" Tony Allen, of the trading standards institute, said: \"It is a very clever bit of publicity. Legislation only requires that things are weighed in metric when you get to the till.\" There have been some cases recently highlighted of traders apparently being warned in a heavy handed way to change to metric scales. But Mr Allen said: \"We have taken a very soft approach to it, by advice and by helping to convert scales. A lot can be converted quite easily and cheaply.\" Competitors yesterday said they too displayed imperial equivalents in many parts of their stores, but imperial weights had disappeared from packaged foods. Sainsbury's said it gave both measurements, with price, on shelves with loose produce, though the metric was slightly more prominent than imperial. There was no comparative pricing at the deli counter, but prices were given per 100 grams rather than kilograms. Asda said its imperial pricing on shelves, though smaller than metric, was in a yellow box. Safeway said it had phased out imperial measures on packaged food to ensure clear labelling for customers.",

      "body": "<p>Nick Stuart, the director-general of lifelong learning at the DfEE, addressed sixth-form college and tertiary principals at their annual conference recently. The agenda he laid out for post-16 lifelong learning on behalf of his ministers is, I believe, utterly reasonable - raising achievement to the standards of the best at present, improving retention, widening participation to form a more inclusive learning society and closing skills gaps in key areas such as information technology and engineering. We are happy to work to that agenda in our colleges. </p> <p>Again, on the positive side, my colleagues are relieved that, at long last, we have a government which understands the need to invest to achieve these objectives. The past few years have seen the first real increases in funding per student for many years, such a refreshing change from the arid policies of year-on-year cuts of 3% and more of the previous administration. We have a real chance, therefore, of making progress in meeting objectives which are both demanding and right. As providers, we are ready to take up the challenge. </p> <p>However, there is one key piece of the jigsaw that must be remodelled to fit into this vision - namely, the administrative interface between the DfEE and providers. At present this is the Further Education Funding Council and the Training and Enterprise Councils, but shortly will be the new Learning and Skills Council. I, for one, am looking for a new partnership between my college, as a provider, and the new Learning and Skills Council and my local learning and skills council. </p> <p> In May, 1999, ministers at the DfEE awarded Greenhead college Beacon College status. At the same time, the funding council awarded the college accredited status. To achieve these, the college had to provide conclusive evidence of the highest standards over time in achievements, retention, widening participation, financial management, top quality assurance in all areas of the college, and strong and visionary governance and management. </p> <p>Fifteen colleges have achieved this Beacon status.

      "bodyText": "Nick Stuart, the director-general of lifelong learning at the DfEE, addressed sixth-form college and tertiary principals at their annual conference recently. The agenda he laid out for post-16 lifelong learning on behalf of his ministers is, I believe, utterly reasonable - raising achievement to the standards of the best at present, improving retention, widening participation to form a more inclusive learning society and closing skills gaps in key areas such as information technology and engineering. We are happy to work to that agenda in our colleges. Again, on the positive side, my colleagues are relieved that, at long last, we have a government which understands the need to invest to achieve these objectives. The past few years have seen the first real increases in funding per student for many years, such a refreshing change from the arid policies of year-on-year cuts of 3% and more of the previous administration. We have a real chance, therefore, of making progress in meeting objectives which are both demanding and right. As providers, we are ready to take up the challenge. However, there is one key piece of the jigsaw that must be remodelled to fit into this vision - namely, the administrative interface between the DfEE and providers. At present this is the Further Education Funding Council and the Training and Enterprise Councils, but shortly will be the new Learning and Skills Council. I, for one, am looking for a new partnership between my college, as a provider, and the new Learning and Skills Council and my local learning and skills council. In May, 1999, ministers at the DfEE awarded Greenhead college Beacon College status. At the same time, the funding council awarded the college accredited status. To achieve these, the college had to provide conclusive evidence of the highest standards over time in achievements, retention, widening participation, financial management, top quality assurance in all areas of the college, and strong and visionary governance and management. Fifteen colleges have achieved this Beacon status. In each, the common factors are that the managers of these colleges set their staff demanding objectives in terms of developing their students' potentials on the one hand, and, here is the crunch, they then ensure that the senior administrative team support their staff in every way possible to meet those objectives. A key part of my job is to ensure my senior staff see as their primary focus the facilitation of my staff and students in terms of resources and support to meet set objectives. I believe our college administration must be of Rolls-Royce standards so that there can be no excuses for not meeting objectives fairly set. So back to my jigsaw piece - the new Learning and Skills Council administration. This has to be a Beacon administration, if we want world-class lifelong learning. I want senior administrators to help me solve my problems, not to create continually new problems for me. I want to know my objectives for the following academic year in January or February, and I want my full budget allocation at the same time. Ideally, I want both presented on two sides of A4, so that my governors and staff can plan for excellence. I am looking for senior administrators who are respectful, genuine and empathetic, and who wish to facilitate and serve me and my fellow principals, so that we can do likewise for our staff. I want a grade one administration, with many strengths and few weaknesses, with people who have a genuine experience of working in the sector. \u0095 Kevin Conway is principal of Greenhead college, Huddersfield.",

The sector could do even more and faster. But holding it back, more than anything, is the equally astonishing fact that the majority of the part-time people delivering the further and lifelong learning revolution are not qualified, in the formal sense, to teach at all. This matters because virtually two thirds of all further education teaching staff are now employed on a part-time basis to do the business. </p> <p>It is a recent phenomenon. In the mid-1980s part-time lecturers accounted for only about 15-20% of the total work workforce. But by last year, this proportion had leapt dramatically to 63%, with many recruited through agencies. </p> <p>Take two examples. Solihull college has 1,118 staff on the pay roll, 178 are full-time lecturers, but 528 are part-timers. At Blackpool &amp; Fylde college there are 271 full-time staff but 322.26 part-time ones. </p> <p>The bad news is not necessarily that part-time teachers do most of the teaching in further education. It is that too many are not up to scratch as teachers, according to senior Further Education Funding Council inspector Beryl Pratley, referring to a national survey to be published soon. </p> <p>However, Paul Mackney, general secretary of the main lecturers' union Natfhe, reckons the problem is not the quality of part-time work taught in colleges, but the way these lecturers and staff are employed. There is, he reckons, the existence of a \"cut-price Yosser approach\", in which lecturers remain casualised on temporary, possibly fixed-term deals, with no contractual rights. </p> <p>There needs to be a high-quality staffing strategy, whereby contracts guarantee on-going work and employment rights are acknowledged and enshrined in colleges' human and resource management practices. </p> <p>Mike Foster, the non-fox hunting MP for Worcester, who is surely in the running for promotion to ministerial office, says the days when part-time lecturers could easily be tagged as \"Neanderthals\" - as one local chamber of commerce had once allegedly lamented - was outdated.

A General Lecturers' Council (GLC) may also be set up, striving to replicate the identical professional body (General Teaching Council) just established for schoolteachers. </p> <p>The intention is that all further education lecturers should eventually have a recognised teaching qualification. It is anticipated that part-timers will be expected to get an intermediate level qualification within two years and a full certificate of education (FE) a year after that. </p> <p>A DfEE consultation paper published recently on the back of year-long talks between sector leaders and civil servants, declared that most of the part-time staff canvassed about this sort of qualification did not object. But the paper also warned: \"Applying the same requirement to part-time lecturers as full-time ones would have the advantage of ensuring that whoever teaches a group of learners has been trained to a consistent professional level. Yet this could also be seen as a barrier to some.\" </p> <p>It is a potential dilemma since employment flexibility is one of further education's indisputable hallmarks. \"Its ability to draw on a wide range of part-time staff, many of whom work in other professions, is an asset which we want to nurture and protect,\" promised the paper. \"But we also want to ensure that students get the highest quality of teaching.

The education department argues that the requirement has been dropped as part of the drive to reduce bureaucracy, but Tulloch believes that schools will eventually be the losers unless they address parental concerns. \"The glib market forces argument was always nonsense,\" she says. \"Parents don't want to vote with their feet - they want their local schools to respond to their children's needs. People want to be listened to, it's something schools need to address.\" Parent governors ought to be the ideal candidates to channel concerns, but many heads are vehemently opposed to governors relaying what they describe as \"tittle-tattle from the school gates\". Sometimes the governors defend the school at all costs. \"In my case,\" said one parent whose child had been bullied, \"the head and the governors clubbed together to deny the problem existed. Legally I suppose they were in the right, morally it was outrageous.\" Some observers believe that the legislation wasn't implemented because heads argued that formal procedures would encourage unreasonable complaints. \"There are some members of the public with unreasonable expectations,\" said the National Consumer Council's Anna Bradley. \"But by far the bigger problem lies with low expectations. People think that no one will take any notice of their complaint, that nothing will happen.\" The Campaign for State Education argues that a complaints procedure is just the first step. \"It's no good just grafting on a procedure,\" says Tulloch, \"it's about changing attitudes to raising problems.\" A recent report by the Economic and Social Research Council echoes that view, arguing that there was a need to rid schools of the \"deep-seated culture\" of deference that stops many parents speaking their minds. Teachers vs. parents What teachers say How are things at home? Any problems there? I don't see how we can change the system just for your child. No, in order to opt for German she has to be in the top set in maths. We sent a message home about this some time ago. We've always run parents' evening like this. I can assure you that there's no bullying in this school. What parents say He seemed to do so much better with Mrs Johnson. How long have you been teaching? No, she doesn't like PE - and neither did I. Perhaps if the classroom were a little quieter, Sophie would be able to finish her work. I can't believe that Kevin would have done anything like that. That's the fifth pencil case she's had stolen this year. \u0095 ACE: 020-7354 8321; ACE exclusion line: 020-7704 9822.

Similarly, throughout the 1950s and 1960s all BBC announcers adopted the clipped upper-class sounds of received pronounciation and yet the accent is now only found in isolated pockets of Knightsbridge and the shires. Today, the BBC's pronunciation department only advises on difficult foreign words and presenters are advised to talk in their local dialects. Which ought to preserve language rather than lose it. Some accents, including Scots, are highly valued for their sense of trustworthiness and mellifluity, but no one has ever bothered to include estuary in either category. Yet estuary it is that marches ever onwards: researchers have noted similar changing dialect patterns to Glasgow in Newcastle, Hull and Derby. But if Estuary is here to stay, it won't be the first time it has made its presence felt. \"In the 14th century, a Londoner wouldn't have been able to understand someone who lived 40 miles outside the city,\" says John Sutherland, Lord Northcliffe Professor of modern english literature at University College London. \"It was eventually Chaucer's English that became the standard.\" Chaucer, Phil 'n Grant. It's a noble lineage. And shortly to become more noble still. Mike Coles, an RE teacher in London, has just translated the Bible into Cockney rhyming slang. Would you Adam 'n' Eve it?",

      "body": "<p>All over Britain strange rituals occur throughout the year. This summer you may see people counting swans, decorating wells or dancing outside pubs with bells on their trousers. Some say these are the activities of crazy people looking for an excuse to dress up in silly clothes or drink too much beer. Supporters say folk traditions provide links to the past and have an important job to do - they give specific groups, communities, even countries, a sense of identity. </p> <p>In fact, folk tradition and lore do not only belong to other people. They contribute to most of our own lives on a daily basis - they may often seem invisible as we take them for granted. </p> <p><strong> What does \"folk\" mean?</strong> </p> <p>One definition of a folk tradition is \"informally transmitted culture\" - a belief, habit or activity that is picked up rather than deliberately learnt. \"Folk\" means \"people\" and so any group regularly repeating an event or activity can be said to be taking part in a folk tradition. Similarly, any story or legend can be called folklore even if it is only retold within a school community or a family. </p> <p><strong> Where do folk traditions come from?</strong> </p> <p>Some may have roots in pre-Christian, pagan belief while others may date from a particular historic event. In Eyam (pronounced \"eem\") in Derbyshire, there are good examples of each. At the end of August the local well is \"dressed\" with flowers, while a separate outdoor church service is held to mark the self-sacrifice of the village during the plague years 1665-6. </p> <p>The historian, Ronald Hutton, says much British folk tradition is linked to the pattern of the seasons. So spring ceremonies include symbols suggesting rebirth, and summer festivals involve merry-making in the sunlight. </p> <p><strong> Are they very different from religious festivals?</strong> </p> <p>They can be closely related. Early Christianity took over parts of many beliefs that pre-dated it. Churches were often built on pagan holy sites while pagan celebrations were transformed into Christian holidays. When England became a Protestant country in the 16th century there was pressure to stop these doubtful traditions. In the 1640s and 1650s many kinds of festivity were banned. But some remained or were started up again later and have survived to this day in one shape or another. </p> <p><strong> Aren't most folk traditions and folklore to do with the countryside?</strong> </p> <p>Inevitably, many are country-based because most people lived there as little as 200 years ago. But cities and towns have a rich folk culture, too, which has often been overlooked. To an outsider, a child collecting coins on behalf of a stuffed \"Guy\" in November might seem strange but to many it is familiar and unremarkable. </p> <p>One of the most interesting forms of city folklore is the urban legend. These are often tales of horror and misfortune which always seem to have happened to \"a friend of a friend\". They arise out of nowhere, are told as if they were true and then vanish again. </p> <p>Children's sayings, rhymes and games are also a form of folklore. Many go back centuries and take different forms across the UK. </p> <p><strong> Can folk traditions survive?</strong> </p> <p>It depends what is meant by \"survive\". Folk culture is not static and timeless. Who is to say that the rules that children create to control Pokemon trading are worth less than more traditional playground songs? </p> <p>The desire to preserve folk traditions dates back to the late 19th century when historians, musicians and poets began to worry about the effect of rapid industrialisation on ordinary people.

      "bodyText": "All over Britain strange rituals occur throughout the year. This summer you may see people counting swans, decorating wells or dancing outside pubs with bells on their trousers. Some say these are the activities of crazy people looking for an excuse to dress up in silly clothes or drink too much beer. Supporters say folk traditions provide links to the past and have an important job to do - they give specific groups, communities, even countries, a sense of identity. In fact, folk tradition and lore do not only belong to other people. They contribute to most of our own lives on a daily basis - they may often seem invisible as we take them for granted. What does \"folk\" mean? One definition of a folk tradition is \"informally transmitted culture\" - a belief, habit or activity that is picked up rather than deliberately learnt. \"Folk\" means \"people\" and so any group regularly repeating an event or activity can be said to be taking part in a folk tradition. Similarly, any story or legend can be called folklore even if it is only retold within a school community or a family. Where do folk traditions come from? Some may have roots in pre-Christian, pagan belief while others may date from a particular historic event. In Eyam (pronounced \"eem\") in Derbyshire, there are good examples of each. At the end of August the local well is \"dressed\" with flowers, while a separate outdoor church service is held to mark the self-sacrifice of the village during the plague years 1665-6. The historian, Ronald Hutton, says much British folk tradition is linked to the pattern of the seasons. So spring ceremonies include symbols suggesting rebirth, and summer festivals involve merry-making in the sunlight. Are they very different from religious festivals? They can be closely related. Early Christianity took over parts of many beliefs that pre-dated it. Churches were often built on pagan holy sites while pagan celebrations were transformed into Christian holidays. When England became a Protestant country in the 16th century there was pressure to stop these doubtful traditions. In the 1640s and 1650s many kinds of festivity were banned. But some remained or were started up again later and have survived to this day in one shape or another. Aren't most folk traditions and folklore to do with the countryside? Inevitably, many are country-based because most people lived there as little as 200 years ago. But cities and towns have a rich folk culture, too, which has often been overlooked. To an outsider, a child collecting coins on behalf of a stuffed \"Guy\" in November might seem strange but to many it is familiar and unremarkable. One of the most interesting forms of city folklore is the urban legend. These are often tales of horror and misfortune which always seem to have happened to \"a friend of a friend\". They arise out of nowhere, are told as if they were true and then vanish again. Children's sayings, rhymes and games are also a form of folklore. Many go back centuries and take different forms across the UK. Can folk traditions survive? It depends what is meant by \"survive\". Folk culture is not static and timeless. Who is to say that the rules that children create to control Pokemon trading are worth less than more traditional playground songs? The desire to preserve folk traditions dates back to the late 19th century when historians, musicians and poets began to worry about the effect of rapid industrialisation on ordinary people. They started collecting songs and folklore and even tried to revive old traditions. Are folk traditions dangerous? Some can help one group and exclude or intimidate another. Northern Irelan's \"marching season\" is one example of this - members of the Protestant community insist they have the right to march through Catholic areas despite the uproar this causes. Activities \u0095 Start a collection of your family sayings and traditions. At school write down games, rhymes and \"friend of friend\" stories you find. \u0095 Visit the folklore society website at www.folklore-society.com \u0095 Find out about regional festivals and celebrations at www.englishtourism.org.uk or www.visitbritain.com \u0095 For Derbyshire well-dressing ceremonies contact 01246 345777. \u0095 For urban legends try www.urbanlegends.com \u0095 The comedian, Mike Harding, has a site devoted to one of the most mysterious characters of folklore: the Green Man at www.mikeharding.co.uk \u0095 My thanks to Caroline Oates of the Folklore Society.",

But help is at hand for those fortunate enough to have internet access - either at home or in a cybercafe.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.planit4kids.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Planit4kids.com</a> is a one-stop destination for everyone searching for ideas on how to entertain their children.</p> <p>For those without access, try the local library, which supplies all kinds of information. Local newspapers often publish a special children's supplement on activities. </p> <p>Many organisations offer all the thrills of a summer camp, but on a non-residential basis. With sites all around England, Camp Beaumont (020-7922 1234) offers Playtime for 3- to 4-year-olds, where they can do anything from acting to roller-skating to sand play. Mini Activity Magic for 5-7s includes archery, swimming, and trampolining. Mini Activity Mania is for 8-11s, offering seven different activities a day. For the older age range, the Teen Club is a chance to make new friends with activities like basketball, and snorkelling, volleyball and arts and crafts. </p> <p>Most local leisure centres run varied sporting programmes, offering tennis lessons, kayak taster sessions or football coaching. And for those into playing, composing, performing and listening to music, Musicale (01582 460978) offers non-residential courses across England for 5-18s. </p> <p>You might want to encourage your little dears to attend a cookery class. Solihull College (0121- 678 7141) offers children's courses for youngsters aged 7 and over. Pre-booking advisable. </p> <p>For those lucky enough to live in Hale, Cheshire (0161-929 6886), a visit to Colour Me Mine, a craft cafe, promises the \"perfect place to relax, enjoy a cappuccino, and indulge your creative urges\". Here, there are 400 ready-to-paint ceramic, terracotta, glass, mosaic and wooden pieces to paint and glaze. Adults can stay, too! </p> <p>Whether or not you're able to take a trip to Europe this year, the summer months can be an excellent time for 3- to 11-year-olds to benefit from language clubs in French, Italian and German run by Le Club Fran\u00e7ais all over the UK. The teaching is informal, with drama, crafts, role-play and plenty of lively games. Ring 01962 714036 to find your nearest club. </p> <p>Many libraries may follow the example of Barry library in Glamorgan (01446 735722) which is running a special computer zone for children to develop their IT skills on PCs. Parents/carers are allowed to try the games too. Entry is free and children are supervised throughout. </p> <p>Budding thespians are spoilt for choice, with many theatres running summer schools/clubs. For example, at the Bull Theatre in Barnet (020-8449 0048) a two-week project at the beginning of August will allow children of 11 years or over to learn about theatre, movement, circus and acrobatic skills. </p> <p>A visit to the Soho House Museum in Handsworth, Birmingham (August 2) is a chance to make and take home your own balloon. A week later a craft session based on the \"Connecting Threads\" exhibition at the museum will be led by the textile artist Debi Keyte. Both activities are free with admission to Soho House. Bambi fans can see the original at the Ashton Court Estate at Long Ashton, Bristol (0117 963 9174) where a deer-feeding walk for children will be led by the estate's deer-keeper on August 1. Country fairs/festivals are generally run in July or August, weather permitting, and can be a fun day out as well as prompting an interest in the crafts and skills on display. </p> <p>Youngsters aged 9-11 are challenged to improve their survival skills at Westonbirt Arboretum, in Gloucestershire (01666 880220) on August 1. Children will learn how to build a den - if such tuition is needed! - and how to follow and lay their own trails in the woods. </p> <p>If all else fails, you could always investigate and start saving for one of the numerous residential courses based here and abroad, and pay someone else to keep your youngsters informed and entertained...</p> <p><strong> After the holidays:</strong> The next \"If you ask me\" column appears in Guardian Education on September 5, and will look at how to ease the trauma of starting a new school. Any tips from readers are welcome. Please send your advice and queries, marked \"If you ask me\", to the address at the end of Letters.</p>",

Any ideas? Many parents/carers will soon be faced with the annual cries of \"I'm bored\", and \"I don't want to play outside\". But help is at hand for those fortunate enough to have internet access - either at home or in a cybercafe. Planit4kids.com is a one-stop destination for everyone searching for ideas on how to entertain their children. For those without access, try the local library, which supplies all kinds of information. Local newspapers often publish a special children's supplement on activities. Many organisations offer all the thrills of a summer camp, but on a non-residential basis. With sites all around England, Camp Beaumont (020-7922 1234) offers Playtime for 3- to 4-year-olds, where they can do anything from acting to roller-skating to sand play. Mini Activity Magic for 5-7s includes archery, swimming, and trampolining. Mini Activity Mania is for 8-11s, offering seven different activities a day. For the older age range, the Teen Club is a chance to make new friends with activities like basketball, and snorkelling, volleyball and arts and crafts. Most local leisure centres run varied sporting programmes, offering tennis lessons, kayak taster sessions or football coaching. And for those into playing, composing, performing and listening to music, Musicale (01582 460978) offers non-residential courses across England for 5-18s. You might want to encourage your little dears to attend a cookery class. Solihull College (0121- 678 7141) offers children's courses for youngsters aged 7 and over. Pre-booking advisable. For those lucky enough to live in Hale, Cheshire (0161-929 6886), a visit to Colour Me Mine, a craft cafe, promises the \"perfect place to relax, enjoy a cappuccino, and indulge your creative urges\". Here, there are 400 ready-to-paint ceramic, terracotta, glass, mosaic and wooden pieces to paint and glaze. Adults can stay, too! Whether or not you're able to take a trip to Europe this year, the summer months can be an excellent time for 3- to 11-year-olds to benefit from language clubs in French, Italian and German run by Le Club Fran\u00e7ais all over the UK. The teaching is informal, with drama, crafts, role-play and plenty of lively games. Ring 01962 714036 to find your nearest club. Many libraries may follow the example of Barry library in Glamorgan (01446 735722) which is running a special computer zone for children to develop their IT skills on PCs. Parents/carers are allowed to try the games too. Entry is free and children are supervised throughout. Budding thespians are spoilt for choice, with many theatres running summer schools/clubs. For example, at the Bull Theatre in Barnet (020-8449 0048) a two-week project at the beginning of August will allow children of 11 years or over to learn about theatre, movement, circus and acrobatic skills. A visit to the Soho House Museum in Handsworth, Birmingham (August 2) is a chance to make and take home your own balloon. A week later a craft session based on the \"Connecting Threads\" exhibition at the museum will be led by the textile artist Debi Keyte. Both activities are free with admission to Soho House. Bambi fans can see the original at the Ashton Court Estate at Long Ashton, Bristol (0117 963 9174) where a deer-feeding walk for children will be led by the estate's deer-keeper on August 1. Country fairs/festivals are generally run in July or August, weather permitting, and can be a fun day out as well as prompting an interest in the crafts and skills on display. Youngsters aged 9-11 are challenged to improve their survival skills at Westonbirt Arboretum, in Gloucestershire (01666 880220) on August 1. Children will learn how to build a den - if such tuition is needed! - and how to follow and lay their own trails in the woods. If all else fails, you could always investigate and start saving for one of the numerous residential courses based here and abroad, and pay someone else to keep your youngsters informed and entertained... After the holidays: The next \"If you ask me\" column appears in Guardian Education on September 5, and will look at how to ease the trauma of starting a new school. Any tips from readers are welcome. Please send your advice and queries, marked \"If you ask me\", to the address at the end of Letters.",

My younger testers chortled at every single picture and demanded several re-readings; they are now experts about bees living in beehives and eagles in nests. Finally there's The Visitors Who Came to Stay (Walker, \u00a39.99), written by Annalena McAfee with illustrations by Anthony Browne. This is a new edition, even more breathtakingly beautiful than the1984 version. Katie, living by the sea, resents the intrusion of Dad's friend Mary and her son Sean into her neat and tidy home. It's a pleasantly told story, but Anthony Browne's extraordinary pictures present such strong visual metaphors that any imaginative child will understand Katie's feelings without reading a word - and, what's more, will understand more about Katie than she does herself. The emotions run very deep - but at the same time there's a wicked sense of humour. Find the rubber plant.",

About a quarter of schools will teach key skills as a separate qualification in its own right, but they are also expected to be taught through the other courses. There have been problems injecting them into the A-level history and English courses. </p> <p>At Thurston, a big, 380-strong sixth form, they are adapting to the new climate. They will be running 20 AS levels in September including two new ones, PE and politics, and five vocational A levels. </p> <p>\"Students will have greater choice as to what they want to do, they are not going to be narrowed down,\" says Helen Neal. \"Everybody will be doing key skills and that will definitely help later on with their employability.\" </p> <p>The school is encouraging students who are doing a mixture of A levels but who want to do one science to take the science vocational A level rather than specialise in biology, physics or chemistry. </p> <p>Some students are taking vocational business alongside AS communication studies; other popular choices include health and social care (vocational) with biology (AS), business (vocational) and maths (AS), leisure and recreation (vocational) and PE (A). But the school, where pupils regularly mix disciplines at A level - common combinations include biology, chemistry and history or physics, chemistry and English - is already used to cutting across the arts/science divide. </p> <p>Using a computer, they have organised a timetable where only about \"10 or 12\" students are not doing exactly what they chose, though it might be more tricky when their choices change again - by as much as 50%, Neal says - once the GCSE results come in and the timetable is fixed. The timetable will be fuller, with 24 out of 30 periods for most students taken up with lessons, rather than the current 18. Neal fears interest in community and voluntary work, which the school encourages, will drop off. </p> <p>Thurston will probably hold most of the AS exams in the summer term, and split the A2 exams, holding them in January and June and lessening the stress of the traditional A-level season. A small number of independent schools are reportedly keeping it going, with knobs on, by holding all a pupil's AS and A2 exams at the same time at the end of two years' study. </p> <p>Generally there are concerns about whether the extra breadth hoped for by the government will be realised. Dunford says the signs are that the popular fourth AS subjects are not maths or foreign languages, as ministers would hope, but media studies, psychology and sociology. \"It's increasing breadth but it's not increasing the wider study at an advanced level the country really needs.\" </p> <p>And even for the most willing schools, there have been problems.

      "bodyText": "Madrid tiene fama de ser una ciudad con mucha marcha. Fiesta es una palabra espa\u00f1ola incorporada al diccionario ingl\u00e9s. Las noches de marcha son muy largas, y la m\u00fasica y el baile contin\u00faan cuando sale el sol. Cada vez m\u00e1s las drogas son tambi\u00e9n parte de la noche. Un 29% de los j\u00f3venes salen de marcha para drogarse, seg\u00fan el estudio \"Salir de marcha y consumo de drogas\", del Plan Nacional sobre Drogas. Uno de cada tres menores de dieciocho a\u00f1os en Espa\u00f1a se emborracha una vez a la semana como m\u00ednimo. Un 10% de los j\u00f3venes mezcla alcohol, cannabis, \u00e9xtasis y coca\u00edna, mientras que en Europa s\u00f3lo un 2,8% mezcla las cuatro drogas. Tres millones de j\u00f3venes han probado el \u00e9xtasis. Y para algunos ha sido mortal. \u00c9ste es el caso de J.P.M, de Madrid, de diecisiete a\u00f1os, y P.M.C, de Pineda de Mar, de catorce a\u00f1os. Crees que Espa\u00f1a es el pa\u00eds de Europa con m\u00e1s marcha? Elisa L\u00f3pez (vive en Madrid y tiene 17 a\u00f1os): En Madrid por las noches hay mucha fiesta. Sin embargo est\u00e1 cambiando. Una nueva Ley de la Comunidad de Madrid proh\u00edbe la venta de alcohol en discotecas y bares a menores de dieciocho a\u00f1os. Antes del verano pod\u00edamos beber alcohol a partir de los diecis\u00e9is a\u00f1os. El resultado es que la gente bebe m\u00e1s, pues se juntan los amigos para comprar alcohol y beber en los parques. Juan \u00c1lvarez (vive en Madrid y tiene 19 a\u00f1os): S\u00ed. Nosotros tenemos otra forma de vivir, de salir y de divertirnos. Lo hacemos con m\u00e1s alegr\u00eda. Aqu\u00ed normalmente se sale hasta las siete de la ma\u00f1ana, y en Francia, por ejemplo, a la una no queda nadie en las calles. C\u00f3mo son las noches de marcha en Madrid? Elisa: Empezamos a las siete y media en la discoteca de tarde, hasta las once y media. Entonces vamos a tomar algo. Pero queremos bailar m\u00e1s y a medianoche volvemos a la discoteca hasta las seis y media de la ma\u00f1ana. Se trata de bailar con la m\u00fasica a tope y sobretodo que sea bakalao.

In the budget, the chancellor explains how he will raise money through taxes; today he explains how he intends to hand it out through spending. Since the budget happens every year but the spending review only every three years, today's announcement is arguably more important than budget day. <p><b>Will it affect me? </b><br> Yes, in a big way if you don't live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland (whose budget allocations are calculated separately, although linked to the review). The review determines how much money government departments will have to spend over the next three years. The public finances are in a healthy state, so Mr Brown has a lot of cash to hand out - an extra \u00a340bn over three years. This means that government spending will grow by 3.3% a year after inflation, far more than any government has been able to offer for years. </p> <p><b>Where's the money likely to go?</b><br> Some parts of the review have already been announced. Health will swallow up \u00a313bn; education is likely to get at least \u00a310bn; while transport, crime, child poverty and regional development are all likely to do well. Defence and the environment will probably miss out. Many of the chancellor's decisions have been well trailed in advance - but his speech is likely to contain some surprises.</p> <p><b>Why has the cake been divided like this? </b><br> Partly because of political priorities. Voters want more money spent on health and education and, with an election coming up, the government is keen to oblige. Likewise, transport looks likely to do well in the review partly because it has become a political hot potato. </p> <p><b>So the chancellor's just trying to buy votes? </b><br> No. The review is also part of an ambitious Treasury project to revolutionise the way British government works. In the past, departments were allocated sums of money after months of tough negotiation. But they often had only a hazy idea of what they actually wanted to do with the cash they won, and had to spend it all within a year. This meant much of the money could have been spent more effectively. The Labour government decided to focus spending on \"outcomes\" - it asked departments what they wanted to do, rather than how much cash they wanted. Departments had to settle a series of \"performance service agreements\" (PSAs) in the first spending review, announced in 1998. In addition, the Treasury set up cross-departmental committees to consider spending on areas not properly covered by one department. </p> <p><b>And did it work? </b><br> To an extent. But the Treasury's demands were so complex that some ministries ended up underspending. And critics claimed that the process effectively put the Treasury in charge of most government activity. In response, the Treasury has simplified the process, cutting the number of PSAs from 600 to 200, but retained what it claims is a coherent strategy for the future of the public sector. </p> <p><b>What do the opposition parties think? </b><br> They believe the chancellor's generosity has much to do with the next election. The Liberal Democrats say that Mr Brown should have increased spending earlier and further. The Conservatives have promised to protect spending in key areas such as health and education, but it remains unclear whether they would cut taxes or invest more in areas such as transport. </p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sr2000/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury: spending review 2000</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/gbfiles/summer2000.shtml\" target=\"_new\">Institute for fiscal studies: spending review</a> <br> <b>Useful documents (requiring Adobe Acrobat)</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pub/html/psa/csrpsa.pdf\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury: public service agreements</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-059.pdf\" target=\"_new\">House of Commons: spending review research paper</a> <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "EMI will today publish more than 300 \"digital downloads\" in the biggest move made by a major record label to sell music online. The corporation will make available 200 singles and 100 full-length albums including music from artists like NWA, Blondie, Mel C, Poison and D'Angelo. Customers can now buy music from over 50 internet music retailers including Amazon.com, CDNow and Virgin Jamcast. However, for now the music will be \"territorially restricted\" and only customers in the US will be able to buy EMI tracks online. The price is expected to be comparable to that of a CD in the high street. \"We believe our music has a fair value in the market,\" says Fergal Gara new media director of EMI records UK, \"this is an experiment and we expect to determine the fair online price is time.\" Mr Gara says EMI UK aims to roll-out a parallel service by the end of the year. Online music pirates have been the bane of the music industry for some years. The popular MP3 file format is used to distribute music illegally with programs like Napster and Gnutella. EMI's downloads will be available in Microsoft's secure Windows Media format. In the future EMI plans to launch versions in LiquidAudio's \"secure\" format too. The announcement has been made to coincide with Microsoft's release of its \"version 7\" of the Windows Media Player.

Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield and former superintendent Bernard Murray deny two sample charges of manslaughter at the disaster in April 1989, when 96 people died during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. In the 27-day trial at Leeds crown court the prosecution said that the case, which has been brought by the Hillsborough Families Support Group, centres around the officers' failure to close a tunnel leading to pens three and four, where the victims died, after Exit Gate C was opened and thousands of fans flooded into the stadium. Alun Jones QC, prosecuting, told the court that opening the gate while failing to close the tunnel at the Sheffield stadium was criminally negligent and amounted to manslaughter. Mr Justice Hooper has told the jury of eight men and four women not to make a decision based on sympathy, either for the victims' families, who have packed the court's public gallery every day, or for the two defendants.

Deshalb haben wir uns auch daf\u00fcr eingesetzt, da\u00df das Tier woanders hinkommt. Die Familie hat sich allerdings ganz verst\u00e4ndig gezeigt und sofort zugestimmt. Das Problem f\u00fcr uns ist nur: Viele Tierheime hier nehmen gar keine Kampfhunde an. Und das macht es ziemlich schwierig, eine neue Unterbringung f\u00fcr diese Hunde zu finden. Vor kurzem hatten wir auch einen Obdachlosen in der Stadt, der mit einem Kampfhund unterwegs war, ihn aber leider nicht an der Leine hatte. Aber auch das haben wir in den Griff gekriegt. Leider macht sich zur Zeit Hysterie unter den Leuten breit. Aber nicht jeder KampfHund ist gef\u00e4hrlich f\u00fcr seine Umwelt. Glossar/ Glossary etw. anstellen: to do sth. wrong begutachten: to observe closely Gassi gehen: to take a dog for a walk das Gehege: a cage; area with a fence scharf machen: to train (a dog) to attack people and other animals der Unfall: accident die Zucht, z\u00fcchten: to breed",

Following the large sums already allocated to health, New Labour finally puts large money where the government's modernising mouth has been.</p> <p>There are some risks here. Much of the additional investment will not arrive until after the general election; mid-way through the next parliament. Is it entirely coincidental that this is precisely the moment when Chancellor Brown might hope to become prime minister if Mr Blair decides to spend more time with his family?</p> <p>The billions sound impressive, but both Mr Blair and Mr Brown are now aware that telephone number sums are meaningless to most people. New Labour's habit of over-boosting and regurgitating previous spending announcements has spread cynicism.</p> <p>The voters will not be impressed until this money produces tangible improvements; better schools, hospitals, and railways that people can touch and taste.</p> <p>That is why Mr Brown laid such heavy emphasis on rewards for results. \"Money will be tied to performance,\" as he put it. If it does not bring about the decisive improvements to the NHS and education that the voters are now led to expect, then support for public provision is likely to be seriously weakened.</p> <p>The left has to show that these large wedges of extra funding can make a real difference. If New Labour fails to deliver, then the case for active government will be badly undermined, which can only be of assistance to the arguments of the right.</p> <p>\"We will fight the next election as the low tax party,\" declared Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, advertising more clearly than ever the Conservative agenda. This is a gamble on the mendacity of the electorate.</p> <p>When majorities tell the pollsters that they would rather have improved services to tax cuts, the Tories assume they are lying. The least convincing part of an underwhelming performance from Mr Portillo was when he was challenged to say which services the Tories will slash to fund tax cuts.</p> <p>\"Which schools? Which hospitals? How many teachers? How many nurses?\" demanded Mr Brown. This is the challenge on which New Labour will seek to impale the Tories on every day until the next polling day.</p> <p>Investment in public services versus tax cuts. That is now the essence of the struggle between New Labour and the Conservatives, a battle not just between politicians, but for the future of Britain.</p>",

Following the large sums already allocated to health, New Labour finally puts large money where the government's modernising mouth has been. There are some risks here. Much of the additional investment will not arrive until after the general election; mid-way through the next parliament. Is it entirely coincidental that this is precisely the moment when Chancellor Brown might hope to become prime minister if Mr Blair decides to spend more time with his family? The billions sound impressive, but both Mr Blair and Mr Brown are now aware that telephone number sums are meaningless to most people. New Labour's habit of over-boosting and regurgitating previous spending announcements has spread cynicism. The voters will not be impressed until this money produces tangible improvements; better schools, hospitals, and railways that people can touch and taste. That is why Mr Brown laid such heavy emphasis on rewards for results. \"Money will be tied to performance,\" as he put it. If it does not bring about the decisive improvements to the NHS and education that the voters are now led to expect, then support for public provision is likely to be seriously weakened. The left has to show that these large wedges of extra funding can make a real difference. If New Labour fails to deliver, then the case for active government will be badly undermined, which can only be of assistance to the arguments of the right. \"We will fight the next election as the low tax party,\" declared Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, advertising more clearly than ever the Conservative agenda. This is a gamble on the mendacity of the electorate. When majorities tell the pollsters that they would rather have improved services to tax cuts, the Tories assume they are lying. The least convincing part of an underwhelming performance from Mr Portillo was when he was challenged to say which services the Tories will slash to fund tax cuts. \"Which schools? Which hospitals? How many teachers? How many nurses?\" demanded Mr Brown. This is the challenge on which New Labour will seek to impale the Tories on every day until the next polling day. Investment in public services versus tax cuts. That is now the essence of the struggle between New Labour and the Conservatives, a battle not just between politicians, but for the future of Britain.",

      "bodyText": "The Prince of Wales has issued his strongest rebuttal yet to rumours he is planning to marry Camilla Parker Bowles. A strongly worded letter to the press complaints commission, written on behalf of the prince by his private secretary, Stephen Lamport, makes an official complaint about a newspaper report that alleged he was \"exploring\" the possibility of marrying Camilla in \"secret discussions\" with the Church of Scotland. The unprecedented letter, which represents the first formal complaint Prince Charles has made to the press watchdog on his own behalf, insists that there was no truth in the article, published by the Sunday Times last month. He has previously only complained about potential invasion of privacy on behalf of his sons. The PCC is asked by Mr Lamport to investigate the report, headlined \"Charles explores Scottish wedding with Camilla\". The report followed Mrs Parker Bowles' surprise ap pearance at a dinner in Holyroodhouse attended by a number of senior clergy. He wrote: \"I should like to make clear that there is no truth whatsoever to the story and I should be very grateful if you would investigate this misleading report.\" It is understood that Prince Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles gave their full support to the contents of the letter sent to the PCC. The couple became the focus of intense speculation over plans for their future after they stepped into the public spotlight together at the Ritz last year. Earlier this year, the Queen met Mrs Parker Bowles at a barbecue at Highgrove, the prince's country home. A courtier quoted in the Times today says: \"We have got to the end of our tether. There is no intention of remarrying. We keep saying it, but it is ignored or dismissed as dissembling. There is to be no wedding.\" The Queen is also understood to have been informed of her son's complaint to the PCC before it was lodged.",
