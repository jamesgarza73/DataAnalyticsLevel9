It also allows the delivery of video on demand and traditional television services via telephone lines. </p> <p>A BT spokesman said the company had conducted its own marketing and research which suggested customers were prepared to pay its \u00a340 charge. \"We believe it's competitive and that people will pay this price.\" </p> <p>At least 30 other companies are planning to offer ADSL services - a move which is expected to lead to price competition. </p> <p>Oftel said not even higher-income groups or keen internet users were prepared to pay more than \u00a313 on average. Only larger households were willing to pay more, but then only \u00a320. </p> <p>Oftel's survey was conducted by Mori in May and also found one in four homes is connected to the internet with the majority of users online for little more than one hour a week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BT was attacked by Oftel yesterday over its \u00a340 monthly charge for high-speed internet access, after a survey by the telecommunication watchdog found consumers wanted cheaper web services. A survey by Oftel of 2,070 consumers found that those interested in asymmetric digital subscriber line technology - which delivers internet access at about 10 times the speed of today's modems - were only prepared to pay an average of \u00a313 a month. Oftel said that even with an additional monthly fee of \u00a310 to have unmetered access that meant the total charge would still be short of the \u00a340 being quoted by BT Openworld. However, BT said yesterday that \u00a313 would not cover its costs of offering ADSL services. ADSL, which is just being rolled out, has had at least 100,000 possible users express interest. It also allows the delivery of video on demand and traditional television services via telephone lines. A BT spokesman said the company had conducted its own marketing and research which suggested customers were prepared to pay its \u00a340 charge. \"We believe it's competitive and that people will pay this price.\" At least 30 other companies are planning to offer ADSL services - a move which is expected to lead to price competition. Oftel said not even higher-income groups or keen internet users were prepared to pay more than \u00a313 on average. Only larger households were willing to pay more, but then only \u00a320. Oftel's survey was conducted by Mori in May and also found one in four homes is connected to the internet with the majority of users online for little more than one hour a week.",

It charts the passage of a woman's life from birth to contented old age, celebrates the continuity of female experience, and inhabits a world far removed from masculine visions of women's dependence on men, though the inherently feminist quality of the text is offset by a push on Weir's part towards the almost ritual expression of a universality of experience.</p> <p>The act of singing is equated with vitality itself, as Norman turns from speech to song as the work's heroine gains her individuality, the process reversing itself at the close as the dissolution of death is quietly contemplated. The instrumental textures become more dense with experience, surrounding Norman with darkly sensual tendrils of sound as sexual maturity is reached, deepening still further for the haunting lullaby in which the heroine rocks her own mother into the final sleep of death. The influence of Stravinsky's Les Noces can be heard in the bell-like sonorities which bring the work to its close. Weir very much has the measure of Norman's voice, exploiting its velvety middle and lower registers (there's a very sexy descent to a low G at one point), keeping her for the most part out of the stratospheres where you can now, just occasionally, detect a beat in the sound. The whole has the timeless beauty of Weir's music at its absolute best. </p> <p>Norman's other contribution to the proceedings is a performance of Schoenberg's Cabaret Songs, fruitily sexy, at times downright dirty, though occasionally sacrificing pitch to innuendo. As an encore, she gave us Strauss's Zueignung (Dedication), pivoting in a circle on the platform so that the reiterations of \"Habe Dank\" (Thank You) were grandiloquently addressed to all areas of the auditorium. Left to their own devices the Sinfonietta, conducted by David Robertson, played Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks with tremendous spike and panache, then were heard at their absolute best in Ravel's Introduction and Allegro, which was ravishingly done, its tremendous harp cadenzas exquisitely played by Helen Tunstall.</p>",

Further performance related payments could take the final figure to \u00a38.5m. </p> <p>At least \u00a36m will be issued as convertible unsecured loan stock in Regent, which will be convertible into Regent ordinary shares at 153p per share. A further \u00a31m will be paid in unsecured loan notes and another \u00a31.5m could be paid in debt if profit targets are met in the two years to June 2002. Regent Inns held 49% of the company. </p> <p>Jongleurs hit the headlines with a combination of live comedy, fast food and dancing, initially provided by John Davy and his wife Maria Kempinska and has launched the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Jack Dee and Ruby Wax. </p> <p>The transactions include an exclusive licence to use the Jongleurs name for existing and future clubs in the UK. </p> <p>Since Regent's first involvement with Jongleurs in 1997 the number of clubs has increased from the two original sites in Battersea, opened in 1983, and Camden to eight nationwide. There are four comedy clubs in London and others in Nottingham, Leicester, Southampton and Oxford. </p> <p>Mr Davy and Ms Kempinska, a former drama teacher, will still book and monitor the quality of all comedy acts and will initially provide box office and marketing support services through the newly formed company, Jongleurs Comedy Limited. </p> <p>They will also own the intellectual property rights to the Jongleurs brand, including broadcast rights and the Jongleurs comedy portal. Regent owns 5% of this company which will take advantage of new internet opportunities. </p> <p>Last year the Jongleurs units showed operating profit of \u00a31.2m, profit before tax of \u00a3700,000 and net assets of \u00a3500,000. Yesterday Regent Inns' share price closed at \u00a31.28, down 1.5p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The husband and wife team who together founded Jongleurs comedy clubs have sold their 51% stake to Regent Inns in a deal that could be worth as much as \u00a38.5m. Regent aims to open up to 15 new clubs in Britain in the next two years. \"We already have one or two sites that we are looking at,\" said Stephen Haupt, Regent's chief executive. Despite past tensions between the controlling family and Regent Inns over price, the pub chain acquired full ownership of the eight Jongleurs comedy clubs and Bar Risa businesses for \u00a37m. Further performance related payments could take the final figure to \u00a38.5m. At least \u00a36m will be issued as convertible unsecured loan stock in Regent, which will be convertible into Regent ordinary shares at 153p per share. A further \u00a31m will be paid in unsecured loan notes and another \u00a31.5m could be paid in debt if profit targets are met in the two years to June 2002. Regent Inns held 49% of the company. Jongleurs hit the headlines with a combination of live comedy, fast food and dancing, initially provided by John Davy and his wife Maria Kempinska and has launched the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Jack Dee and Ruby Wax. The transactions include an exclusive licence to use the Jongleurs name for existing and future clubs in the UK. Since Regent's first involvement with Jongleurs in 1997 the number of clubs has increased from the two original sites in Battersea, opened in 1983, and Camden to eight nationwide. There are four comedy clubs in London and others in Nottingham, Leicester, Southampton and Oxford. Mr Davy and Ms Kempinska, a former drama teacher, will still book and monitor the quality of all comedy acts and will initially provide box office and marketing support services through the newly formed company, Jongleurs Comedy Limited. They will also own the intellectual property rights to the Jongleurs brand, including broadcast rights and the Jongleurs comedy portal. Regent owns 5% of this company which will take advantage of new internet opportunities. Last year the Jongleurs units showed operating profit of \u00a31.2m, profit before tax of \u00a3700,000 and net assets of \u00a3500,000. Yesterday Regent Inns' share price closed at \u00a31.28, down 1.5p.",

Another results-related mover was long-distance telecoms group Colt Telecom, which advanced 116p to \u00a321.56. Colt reports today and most pundits are confident that it will report revenues toward the top end of expectations. On the downside, Nycomed Amersham shed 52p to 646p, as it confirmed one of the market's worst kept secrets: the planned flotation of its jointly owned life sciences business, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Among the smaller FTSE 250 stocks, engineer McKechnie rose 24p to 395p as it finally agreed a 400p a share management buy-out, while property group Minerva rose 7p to 244.5p, boosted by planning permission for a \u00a3700m shopping mall. Internet action group QXL.com was under pressure again (down 3p at 65p) this time from news that the blind trust of chairman Jonathan Bulkeley has disposed of 325,000 shares, supposedly to cover its administrative fees. Software group Merant, down 41.5p to 88.5p, was one of the worst performing smaller company shares as its first-quarter results came in sharply below expectations. Tagger is on track Dmatek, the Israeli maker of electronic tagging equipment, reports its first set of figures since graduating from AIM today and, according to the word in the market, investors will not be disappointed. Half-time figures are said to have met management's expectations and the company is reckoned to be close to appointing a City broker. Best know for the tagging low-risk criminals, Dmatek is trying to diversify its customer base by moving into other fields such as the lucrative US healthcare market. A system for monitoring Alzheimer patients using its core tagging technology is being tested by health authorities in the US and is said to be going well. Dmatek, which made a net profit after tax of $1.76m in 1999, is high risk, high reward investment. Its shares closed 17.5p higher at 247p yesterday but are still some way from the 334.5p reached in March.",

The youngsters could finally put school behind them at the start of the summer holidays, excited at the prospect of an action-packed adventure holiday in the Dordogne where they would enjoy canoeing, rock climbing, white-water rafting, assault courses and horse-riding. But today's tragic news that a British teenager had died and 17 passengers were injured, up to seven of them seriously, after their coach overturned on the way to the holiday, inevitably raised fresh anxieties about the risks and dangers of school trips. Two parties of children aged between 13 and 17, from Chadwell Heath Foundation school, Romford, Essex and the 41st Edinburgh Boys Brigade were travelling with the Hertfordshire-based school travel specialists PGL Travel. The company, which was set up 27 years ago, has a sound reputation as a specialist travel company and boasts an exemplary safety record. Guidance is issued by the department for education and employment for local education authorities placing a strict duty on their schools to look after the children in their care. That applies whether a school organises a trip itself, or whether - as in this case - it 'sub-contracts' it to an outside organisation. Suitable transport is one of the first considerations, for travel in the UK as well as overseas. British coaches are subject to strict safety regulations and the rules governing the transportation of children are even more stringent. All coaches which carry schoolchildren must now be fitted with seatbelts, although many already had them installed before their usage became compulsory. There are also firm rules about the hours drivers can do. With drivers needing, by law, to rest from time to time, coaches on long journeys will have two. As a back-up, drivers' hours are closely monitored by the tachograph - once dubbed by truckers as the \"spy in the cab\" - which records the numbers of hours that drivers complete and the speed at which they drive. But the worries about the threats of litigation from parents and the damage caused by bad publicity are understandably making head teachers less keen than they used to be about organising the kind of trips that are designed to build on what a child learns in the classroom. By coincidence, last week, a motion was discussed at the annual conference of the Professional Association of Teachers, highlighting delegates' concerns about the mass of red tape and bureaucracy involved in school trips. While acknowledging the need for many of the steps on health and safety grounds, the motion said: 'Conference believes that the level of regulation and bureaucracy involved in taking pupils out of school is so great that it is no longer considered 'worth the effort'\". Written consent, for example, is required by parents as well as full details of any allergies that a child might have, medication that they might need and permission for the teacher to act as guardian, while transport considerations and the need to check out premises and sites all add to the teachers' workload. The PAT rightly believes that school trips are important and should continue. The safety and welfare of children has always been of paramount importance and should continue to be so. The French tragedy is regrettable, but should not deter parents from sending children on valuable extra-curricular trips of this kind which can do so much to broaden their horizons.

      "body": "<p>You tend not to associate the word \"politics\" with the phrase \"Edinburgh fringe comedy festival\", unless you're talking about the Scottish Assembly. So why am I taking my own brand of Chomsky-lite stand-up to the Edinburgh fringe this month? Political comedy is dead. The ideological battles are over. History has ended. There is no alternative. There is no conflict between the interests of workers and bosses - in fact, there aren't even workers and bosses any more. </p> <p>If there's one thing comedy loves more than rigidities, authoritarian pronouncements, lies, conformity, ideologues and the views of rich people in general, it is this: a world in which everything has been sorted out lovely and we're all working together like a team. (Two fellers pouring cement together, one fat, one thin. A sunny day. Pocketing his fob-watch, the foreman sets off for lunch, happy in the knowledge that when he comes back it'll all be finished.) </p> <p>Newsnight editor Peter Horrocks embraced this mood of togetherness when he told his staff in 1997: \"Our job should not be to quarrel with the purpose of policy, but to question its implementation.\" Everything has turned out nice - even if there are still some people who don't realise that the class war is over and believe there is a conflict of interest between bosses and workers. People like the International Herald Tribune, say, whose recent jubilant front-page announced: Rise In Joblessness Delights US Markets. And BusinessWeek with its headline: Thanks, Goodbye - Amid Record Profits Companies Continue To Lay Off Employees. (Two men whistling, and the gentle rumble of an approaching steamroller.) </p> <p>Everywhere people are angry, betrayed, working longer hours just to pay their bills, and hoping they never get ill or old or have kids who want to go to university. Nowadays political stand-up gets the kind of response in places like Barnstaple, Gravesend and Maidstone that five years ago you used only to get in Liverpool, Glasgow, Manchester or Sheffield. In as unlikely a place as the Hampshire market town of Petersfield, for example, I noticed people were particularly angry. I'd only been on stage 10 minutes before many of them were standing up, grabbing their coats and rushing out in a seething revolutionary mass. An insurgent mob demanding money from the theatre-owners themselves! </p> <p>The past 20 years have seen a rollback of a century's social progress and democracy. This presents politically involved musicians, writers, artists, film-makers and performers with a challenge: how to describe the Hydra of corporate-led globalisation. Or, to put this question strictly in terms of comedy: when the central fact of life is an unprecedented upward transfer of power and wealth from people to unaccountable private tyrannies, where da gags gonna come from? </p> <p>Well, firstly you can forget about conventional satire. Lampooning politicians is inherently reactionary. By attacking individual politicians, satire implies that were it not for these few \"rotten apples\" - bunglers or swindlers - then the system of corporate-led globalisation itself would be just fine and dandy. John Pilger has described conventional satire as a handy safety-valve. </p> <p>Satire has no fire in its belly and believes in nothing. Which is why the producer of a famous TV satire show told me that there is no such thing as poverty in Britain, nor are there \"systems\" or \"class interests\". (He then went on to moan how everyone thinks he is right-wing, but really he isn't anything.) </p> <p>Satire always ends up following the news agenda and replicating its institutional biases - for example, the habit of ignoring issues to talk about power-play, intrigues and the whole wretched soap opera of Westminster gossip. (Quite apart from the fact that separate studies show that 40% of all \"news\" items are laundered PR messages that come from \"issues management\" firms like Burson Marsteller and Hill &amp; Knowlton. ) </p> <p>I'm not saying that having a pop at individual politicians or CEOs is always pointless. Just that there's satire and satire. A great political comedian like Roberto Benigni never gives Fiat chariman Gianni Agnelli and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi the legitimacy those feudal lords claim for themselves. When Benigni does Agnelli's walk or Berlusconi's slow head-turn, their arch-grandiosity seems like a bubble they can go around in just so long as they never meet the real world. He gets laughs off them precisely because he shows them to be mere, witless, products of a rigged system. In Italy they call this system appartenenza; in Britain it's called the \"public-private partnership\". In both countries it means the same: a socialist nanny state lavishing corporate welfare on the rich and \"tough love\" capitalist market discipline on the poor. </p> <p>Same with Michael Moore. When the people's champ gives us the dope on corporate bosses and sweatshop kings, he never presents their greed as some kind of deplorable personal trait. Moore never suggests they should be replaced by some other CEO who is less greedy. A nice CEO! A gentle robber baron! To a union-man like Moore they are part of a process of exploitation (and part of that same system that BBC \"satire\" producers don't believe in). </p> <p>The Zapatistas define humanity as \"the struggle against de-humanisation, the struggle to walk upright in a world that keeps pushing us down\". This could be a description of Chaplin's Modern Times, right down to that see-saw floor of his rickety shack. Or Laurel and Hardy, or Steptoe, or Richard Pryor. The modern satirical idea, however, is somewhat different. Instead of misfits trying to conform, we have conformists trying to look rebellious. </p> <p>PJ O'Rourke, Jeremy Clarkson, David Aaronovich, Richard Littlejohn, Rush Limbaugh - all these self-styled \"iconoclasts\" are, in fact, high-priests of dominant and fashionable orthodoxy. These brave and rugged frontiersmen want to impress us with their subversive views, but when do we ever hear anything else anyway? All we ever get is the corporate-friendly view. Where are the acres of news space about grassroots alternatives to the free market? Where are the black feminists' syndicated columns? Jeremy Clarkson hurls manful defiance at the new green tyranny of endless eco-shows like, er, Top Gear, The Car's the Star, Grand Prix Highlights and The Farnborough Air Show. Listen, bubblecut: BP is in the_ govern_ment! </p> <p>Apart from TB, one characteristic that this neo-liberalism shares with other golden ages of political comedy, like the late 19th century, is that the gags just write themselves. At last week's demonstration against tube privatisation, Bob Crowe of the RMT described how a gas company is running the fire station, Virgin is supplying gas, Western Water is bidding for the tube, and non- emer gency ambulances are in the hands of a mini-cab firm. Not only has Dickens's Circumlocution Office been privatised but Podsnappery is flourishing too. In Dickens's description of Podsnap in Our Mutual Friend you can almost see Tony Blair or Clare Short when someone confronts them with one of those words that have been taken out of the dictionary, like \"class\" or \"imperialism\": </p> <p> Mr Podsnap settled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence. There was a dignified conclusiveness - not to say a grand convenience - in this way of getting rid of undesirables_ Mr Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish to his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems, by sweeping them behind him (and consequently sheer away). </p> <p>All year BBC economics correspondents and New Labourites have been saying that there is \"almost zero unemployment in the US\". A quick phone call to the Census Bureau or the American Bureau Of Labor Statistics might give them figures between 12m and 15m. Not including the 2m banged up. But that's not the point. In today's elitist cant, if the facts don't fit, they have to be suppressed for the ideology to survive. </p> <p>And this brings us to one of the major obstacles to doing a political comedy show: such is the state of British \"news media\", there is a real information problem. If, for example, you happen to have a hilarious yet rousingly defiant routine on the recent Bolivian water riots, you first have to: </p> <p>a) convince people that they've happened; and </p> <p>b) tell them what happened. </p> <p>And in doing this you run the risk of clogging up your act, over-loading it with stodgy chunks of background data. But the flipside of this is that there is sometimes an agreeable expectation when audiences can't quite see where the next gag's gonna come from - a tension I have been known to let build up for an hour. </p> <p>Ironically, one of the reasons the public don't have the facts is what Jeremy Hardy describes as the \"tyranny of humour\". Every news and current affairs show has its gonky comedy bit. I like to think that my stand-up shows are one of the few places people can escape this incessant humour, the wall-to-wall comedy of our chuckle-culture. </p> <p>Even as audiences queue up, an expectant grin on their vacant maws, I like to watch them through a crack in the dressing room door and think: I'll wipe that smile off your face. </p> <p>\u0095 Robert Newman's new show, Resistance Is Fertile, is at the Assembly Rooms (0131-226 2428) from August 12-17. He will be giving a series of free lunchtime lectures at the Stand (0131-558 7373) from August 14.</p>",

An insurgent mob demanding money from the theatre-owners themselves! The past 20 years have seen a rollback of a century's social progress and democracy. This presents politically involved musicians, writers, artists, film-makers and performers with a challenge: how to describe the Hydra of corporate-led globalisation. Or, to put this question strictly in terms of comedy: when the central fact of life is an unprecedented upward transfer of power and wealth from people to unaccountable private tyrannies, where da gags gonna come from? Well, firstly you can forget about conventional satire. Lampooning politicians is inherently reactionary. By attacking individual politicians, satire implies that were it not for these few \"rotten apples\" - bunglers or swindlers - then the system of corporate-led globalisation itself would be just fine and dandy. John Pilger has described conventional satire as a handy safety-valve. Satire has no fire in its belly and believes in nothing. Which is why the producer of a famous TV satire show told me that there is no such thing as poverty in Britain, nor are there \"systems\" or \"class interests\". (He then went on to moan how everyone thinks he is right-wing, but really he isn't anything.) Satire always ends up following the news agenda and replicating its institutional biases - for example, the habit of ignoring issues to talk about power-play, intrigues and the whole wretched soap opera of Westminster gossip. (Quite apart from the fact that separate studies show that 40% of all \"news\" items are laundered PR messages that come from \"issues management\" firms like Burson Marsteller and Hill &amp; Knowlton. ) I'm not saying that having a pop at individual politicians or CEOs is always pointless. Just that there's satire and satire. A great political comedian like Roberto Benigni never gives Fiat chariman Gianni Agnelli and media mogul Silvio Berlusconi the legitimacy those feudal lords claim for themselves. When Benigni does Agnelli's walk or Berlusconi's slow head-turn, their arch-grandiosity seems like a bubble they can go around in just so long as they never meet the real world. He gets laughs off them precisely because he shows them to be mere, witless, products of a rigged system. In Italy they call this system appartenenza; in Britain it's called the \"public-private partnership\". In both countries it means the same: a socialist nanny state lavishing corporate welfare on the rich and \"tough love\" capitalist market discipline on the poor. Same with Michael Moore. When the people's champ gives us the dope on corporate bosses and sweatshop kings, he never presents their greed as some kind of deplorable personal trait. Moore never suggests they should be replaced by some other CEO who is less greedy. A nice CEO! A gentle robber baron! To a union-man like Moore they are part of a process of exploitation (and part of that same system that BBC \"satire\" producers don't believe in). The Zapatistas define humanity as \"the struggle against de-humanisation, the struggle to walk upright in a world that keeps pushing us down\". This could be a description of Chaplin's Modern Times, right down to that see-saw floor of his rickety shack. Or Laurel and Hardy, or Steptoe, or Richard Pryor. The modern satirical idea, however, is somewhat different. Instead of misfits trying to conform, we have conformists trying to look rebellious. PJ O'Rourke, Jeremy Clarkson, David Aaronovich, Richard Littlejohn, Rush Limbaugh - all these self-styled \"iconoclasts\" are, in fact, high-priests of dominant and fashionable orthodoxy. These brave and rugged frontiersmen want to impress us with their subversive views, but when do we ever hear anything else anyway? All we ever get is the corporate-friendly view. Where are the acres of news space about grassroots alternatives to the free market? Where are the black feminists' syndicated columns? Jeremy Clarkson hurls manful defiance at the new green tyranny of endless eco-shows like, er, Top Gear, The Car's the Star, Grand Prix Highlights and The Farnborough Air Show. Listen, bubblecut: BP is in the_ govern_ment! Apart from TB, one characteristic that this neo-liberalism shares with other golden ages of political comedy, like the late 19th century, is that the gags just write themselves. At last week's demonstration against tube privatisation, Bob Crowe of the RMT described how a gas company is running the fire station, Virgin is supplying gas, Western Water is bidding for the tube, and non- emer gency ambulances are in the hands of a mini-cab firm. Not only has Dickens's Circumlocution Office been privatised but Podsnappery is flourishing too. In Dickens's description of Podsnap in Our Mutual Friend you can almost see Tony Blair or Clare Short when someone confronts them with one of those words that have been taken out of the dictionary, like \"class\" or \"imperialism\": Mr Podsnap settled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence. There was a dignified conclusiveness - not to say a grand convenience - in this way of getting rid of undesirables_ Mr Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish to his right arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems, by sweeping them behind him (and consequently sheer away). All year BBC economics correspondents and New Labourites have been saying that there is \"almost zero unemployment in the US\". A quick phone call to the Census Bureau or the American Bureau Of Labor Statistics might give them figures between 12m and 15m. Not including the 2m banged up. But that's not the point. In today's elitist cant, if the facts don't fit, they have to be suppressed for the ideology to survive. And this brings us to one of the major obstacles to doing a political comedy show: such is the state of British \"news media\", there is a real information problem. If, for example, you happen to have a hilarious yet rousingly defiant routine on the recent Bolivian water riots, you first have to: a) convince people that they've happened; and b) tell them what happened. And in doing this you run the risk of clogging up your act, over-loading it with stodgy chunks of background data. But the flipside of this is that there is sometimes an agreeable expectation when audiences can't quite see where the next gag's gonna come from - a tension I have been known to let build up for an hour. Ironically, one of the reasons the public don't have the facts is what Jeremy Hardy describes as the \"tyranny of humour\". Every news and current affairs show has its gonky comedy bit. I like to think that my stand-up shows are one of the few places people can escape this incessant humour, the wall-to-wall comedy of our chuckle-culture. Even as audiences queue up, an expectant grin on their vacant maws, I like to watch them through a crack in the dressing room door and think: I'll wipe that smile off your face. \u0095 Robert Newman's new show, Resistance Is Fertile, is at the Assembly Rooms (0131-226 2428) from August 12-17. He will be giving a series of free lunchtime lectures at the Stand (0131-558 7373) from August 14.",

He played some lovely little backspin dinks, fine one-twos and through-balls and generally ran the show. </p> <p>But with Dieter Hamann anonymous and Jamie Carragher, holding in Steven Gerrard's absence, out of his depth, Liverpool were over-reliant on a 35-year-old Scot. His withdrawal was always going to scupper the side. So it was to prove when G\u00e9rard Houllier pulled him off after 65 minutes, exacerbating the imbalance by putting on a striker, Erik Meijer. </p> <p>Benfica began to dominate, with Karel Poborsky particularly impressive. His career with Manchester United guaranteed him Liverpool boos every time he touched the ball but his two-goal performance won him grudging applause when he was brought off just before the end. </p> <p>His first was a wonderful scissor-kick as he lingered unmarked at the back post and his second again exposed defensive frailties. Three players backed off him as he ran from his own half to finish beyond Sander Westerveld, with Carragher the main culprit. </p> <p>Liverpool held out for a draw and, having thumped Glentoran 4-0 in the first game, pipped Benfica to the silverware. It may be their only trophy come the end of the season. </p> <p>They were, as usual, hamstrung with injuries. Robbie Fowler is out for six weeks after damaging an ankle against Glentoran and Gerrard, Emile Heskey and Jamie Redknapp were all missing. But they need to improve considerably and will be grateful that their first Premiership fixture sees the relegation favourites Bradford City visit Anfield on Saturday week. </p> <p><strong> Exposed</strong><br>Houllier, who refused to discuss whether Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege is on his way, said: \"It was a disappointing result because we were in command of the game.

The India leg-spinner Anil Kumble returned match figures of 10 for 105 but could not force a victory for Leicestershire over Kent, who had followed on 174 runs behind at Canterbury. In the Second Division, Glamorgan's promotion push was interrupted by a 10-wicket defeat by Gloucestershire at Bristol, where Alastair Bressington had match figures of five for 49 on his debut. In Colombo, Lance Klusener hit an unbeaten 50 to check a South Africa batting collapse against Sri Lanka yesterday on the first day of the third and final Test. When rain stopped play shortly before tea, South Africa had made 194 for seven after sliding to 103 for five.",

If his cricketing powers have since waned, he can still be as single-minded as ever when he wants. And right now he wants.

Payments of transfer fees for contracted footballers would become a thing of the past with, for instance, Manchester United's Roy Keane, the Premiership's highest paid player, able to move any time, anywhere without the club receiving a penny in return. At the other end of the scale, smaller clubs who have nurtured and developed rising stars and desperately in need of funds would receive nothing when their most prized assets move on. Until now, contracted players have been unaffected by the five-year-old Bosman ruling which changed the face of European football but only affects those who are out of contract and free agents. But the case now being studied in Brussels would, if upheld, extend Bosman to every professional currently employed in any EC country. The alarming prospect of an end to the transfer system as we know it was the biggest single revelation made by Fifa at its two-day congress in Zurich at the weekend. So anxious is the world governing body to prevent what it believes would lead to total disruption that it has joined forces with Uefa in a rare combined assault on Brussels. Fifa general secretary Michel zen Ruffinen says his organisation has received \"signals\" that the EU might be preparing to rule in favour of Italian club Perugia who have appealed against being forced to pay for a player it recruited from Belgium but who has now left the club. Perugia's ground-breaking case apparently hinges on the fact that under normal employment law, it should not have had to pay anything even though the player concerned was still under contract. In what is being widely viewed as a crucial test case for the future of the game, a preliminary hearing into Perugia's appeal is due to be held next month. If upheld, it could do away overnight with a system that has been in place for decades resulting in alarming ramifications. \"If we allow players under contract to leave without any compensation, it would be a disaster. It would kill football as we know it,\" Zen Ruffinen said. \"It would be impossible to police.\" The combined Fifa-Uefa group of experts is expected to hold its first meeting within the next three weeks to formulate an urgent recommendation to Brussels. \"This is a very dangerous situation and one we need to address very quickly,\" zen Ruffinen said. \"We may have to find some other kind of solution that binds a player to a club.\" Apart from potential transfer chaos, a global agreement that the World Cup should be rotated in future was the other most significant item to emerge from Fifa's 203-nation congress. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that Africa may not be the only Continent bidding for the tournament when the principle of rotation begins in 2010. It was only after being assured that the African Continent would be in pole position for 2010 that South Africa agreed reluctantly to withdraw its threat to take the controversial 2006 vote, which it narrowly lost to Germany, to a civil court. But there is a growing body of opinion within Fifa that rotating the World Cup around the six Continents will not work. One proposal already being studied is to let any Continent bid for the event provided it has not held either of the last two.

      "bodyText": "The Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson at least saw encouraging displays from two of his new signings, the Australian Paul Okon and Cameroon's Joseph-Desire Job, in Middlesbrough's 2-0 defeat against Borussia Dortmund at the Riverside Stadium yesterday. Boro were off the pace in a friendly that also marked Robbie Mustoe's ten years at the club, but Okon was industrious and Job caused problems for Dortmund's central defenders. Hamilton Ricard, by contrast, had a poor game and was withdrawn at half-time. A strike from Victor Ikpeba and an own goal from the young Boro defender Jason Gavin won the game for the Germans. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will not have missed the irony as Barcelona, featuring his \u00a330m cast-offs Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit, won Ajax's Centenary Tournament in Amsterdam on Saturday. But the Arsenal manager is likely to have been more concerned about the lack of sharpness among his front-rank performers in the closing tournament game against Ajax as Arsenal went down 2-1 following defeat by Barca on Thursday. Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira, both substituted in the second half, looked sluggish, while Robert Pires and Lauren did little to show they will quickly fill the gaps left by Overmars and Petit. Barcelona, who played Petit as a sweeper and brought Overmars on as a second-half substitute, clinched the title on goals-scored with a 3-3 draw against Lazio. Aston Villa, who are expected to show off their new signing David Ginola in Friday's final pre-season friendly at Benfica, may have temporarily lost the services of their full back Mark Delaney after he sustained a suspected knee ligament injury during Villa's 1-1 draw at Tamworth on Saturday. Fabien Barthez's debut for Manchester United was a losing one as his new team lost 3-1 to Bayern Munich in the final of that club's Centenary Tournament at the Olympicstadion. David Beckham missed a second-half penalty and United's defence looked out of sorts for most of the game as the tournament hosts gained some sort of revenge for their defeat in the 1999 Champions League final. The European champions, Real Madrid, who were beaten 1-0 by United on Friday, came from behind to beat the Uefa Cup holders Galatasaray 3-2 and take third place in the tournament. Paul Gascoigne took part in Everton's 4-1 win over Exeter but was only brought on in the 69th minute, by which time his side had taken an unassailable lead with two goals from Alex Nyarko and one each from Niclas Alexandersson and Francis Jeffers. George Weah's debut for Manchester City was the only bright spot in an unnerving 4-1 defeat at Stockport for Joe Royle's newly-promoted side. Weah, who scored City's only goal, initially struggled to build a rapport with his new team-mates but improved as the game went on. \"He hasn't lost any of his pace - but he needs a yard of sharpness,\" said Royle, who described the overall display as City's worst in two years. The Tottenham manager George Graham left Ian Walker on the bench in favour of Neil Sullivan for the second successive warm-up game as he used 17 players in a 2-0 win over QPR in Danny Maddix's testimonial.",

In later years, Sir Alec said he threw away all Star Wars fan mail unopened, despite the 2% cut of the director's gross royalties he received from the blockbuster film. \"He was one of the most talented and respected actors of his generation and brought an amazing range and versatility to his work,\" said Star Wars creator George Lucas. In 1980, he was awarded a second Oscar for his outstanding contribution to screen acting. The son of a banker, Sir Alec always wanted to be an actor as a boy and often walked three miles from his home in Bayswater, central London, to the Old Vic to spend his pocket money watching performances there. Fellow actor Sir John Mills said:\"He was first of all, as you know, a very, very great actor but he was very, very retiring, shy, very charming and he had great humility.\" Sir Alec leaves behind his wife of 62 years, playwright Merula Salaman, and son Matthew.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television and strove throughout his career to assert balance and rationality into television's treatment of current affairs.</p> <p>He was the youngest of four children by nine years. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge School, had an uneventful wartime period in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24.</p> <p>He made his mark at Oxford as a memorable president of the union. Then he had a brief spell at the bar, but decided after two years that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British information services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio. In 1955 he joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters.</p> <p>ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television. He was not an instant success. It was originally felt, by his colleagues as well as critics, that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing.</p> <p>In the pre-Day era, interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's time and money. Day asked him questions about ITN's future which dumbfounded colleagues and television critics alike by their directness. It was unprecedented at that time that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees. The interview made a dramatic impact.</p> <p>There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the Suez war, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-US president Harry Truman: \"Mr President do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and notably with former British prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958: \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\" (Daily Express).</p> <p>This interview made Macmillan - forever known afterwards as - Supermac into a television personality and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive (years before it was shown on television) with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez war.</p> <p>In 1959 Day moved to Panorama, then the most prestigious programme on current affairs. The BBC never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and eventually in Question Time. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\" with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman who simply opened and closed programmes, or even not used at all.</p> <p>He described his pre-Question Time period at the BBC as 10 years in the wilderness. There was even a period of nearly two years when he never appeared on the box at all.</p> <p>In the early-1970s he became more deeply involved in radio, where he again proved an innovator with It's Your Line, a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people for the first time to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians. This in turn spawned Election Call.</p> <p>He also presented The World At One for eight years but he never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a prepared script, particularly towards the end of his time on The World At One and it is significant that in his memoirs he dismisses his eight-year contribution with a single sentence.</p> <p>General elections were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner were on full display, when the television public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour. But his most satisfying role in television came relatively late, in 1979, with Question Time. At last he was given his own show with an audience, which he had long asked for, though late at night, as a temporary, six-month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents.</p> <p>Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised persons in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other TV stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures (and, as he much resented, far higher salaries)? It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship.</p> <p>He was inordinately proud of his Old Time Music Hall gifts and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecombe and Wise Christmas shows and especially of his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath the Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he out-starred and out-sang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life.</p> <p>Robin Day imbibed politics almost from the day he was born. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old he was taken to hear Churchill speak (in the rain). Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession was at the heart of his political philosophy all his life.</p> <p>It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow.

      "bodyText": "Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television and strove throughout his career to assert balance and rationality into television's treatment of current affairs. He was the youngest of four children by nine years. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge School, had an uneventful wartime period in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24. He made his mark at Oxford as a memorable president of the union. Then he had a brief spell at the bar, but decided after two years that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British information services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio. In 1955 he joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters. ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television. He was not an instant success. It was originally felt, by his colleagues as well as critics, that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing. In the pre-Day era, interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's time and money. Day asked him questions about ITN's future which dumbfounded colleagues and television critics alike by their directness. It was unprecedented at that time that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees. The interview made a dramatic impact. There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the Suez war, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-US president Harry Truman: \"Mr President do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and notably with former British prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958: \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\" (Daily Express). This interview made Macmillan - forever known afterwards as - Supermac into a television personality and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive (years before it was shown on television) with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez war. In 1959 Day moved to Panorama, then the most prestigious programme on current affairs. The BBC never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and eventually in Question Time. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\" with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman who simply opened and closed programmes, or even not used at all. He described his pre-Question Time period at the BBC as 10 years in the wilderness. There was even a period of nearly two years when he never appeared on the box at all. In the early-1970s he became more deeply involved in radio, where he again proved an innovator with It's Your Line, a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people for the first time to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians. This in turn spawned Election Call. He also presented The World At One for eight years but he never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a prepared script, particularly towards the end of his time on The World At One and it is significant that in his memoirs he dismisses his eight-year contribution with a single sentence. General elections were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner were on full display, when the television public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour. But his most satisfying role in television came relatively late, in 1979, with Question Time. At last he was given his own show with an audience, which he had long asked for, though late at night, as a temporary, six-month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents. Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised persons in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other TV stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures (and, as he much resented, far higher salaries)? It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship. He was inordinately proud of his Old Time Music Hall gifts and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecombe and Wise Christmas shows and especially of his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath the Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he out-starred and out-sang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life. Robin Day imbibed politics almost from the day he was born. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old he was taken to hear Churchill speak (in the rain). Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession was at the heart of his political philosophy all his life. It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech they had won a great battle, when in fact it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics or developments in European countries. Gradually his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But within the boundaries of his particular interests he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public. He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed.

Not only are the most substantial new plays coming from women writers, but three major fringe productions have reminded us of the extent to which women have always provided mythical theatrical archetypes. Seeing variations on Ibsen's Nora, Euripides's Medea and Wedekind's Lulu in close proximity you understand how independence is only achieved through terrifying personal sacrifice. </p> <p>The mystery about the National Theatre of Norway's outstanding production of A Doll's House at the Lyceum is why it is only playing three performances on the fringe; it cries out to be a part of Brian McMaster's international festival. While respecting Ibsen's text, it brings out more clearly than any version I have seen the way Nora is forced into a life of domestic prostitution. Having forged a document to pay her husband's life-saving medical bills, she is driven into all kinds of sexual humiliation to conceal the truth. </p> <p>Anneke von der Lippe's Nora, a vivacious brunette in a low-cut red dress, is clearly accustomed to private whoring. The bird-noises she makes as she literally leaps into Torvald's arms are part of a masochistic sexual ritual. When she tells him that \"the skylark will do tricks\" she goes on all fours and provocatively wiggles her bum at him. Sex is this Nora's secret weapon. But its over-use reduces her to bulimic, suicidal desperation as she vomits up the macaroons she constantly stuffs in her mouth. Her final declaration of independence becomes all the more powerful because we have seen the humiliations imposed on her by marital captivity. It is a brilliant performance in a first-rate production by Kjetil Bang-Hansen. </p> <p>Where Nora leaves her children, Medea, in Liz Lochhead's pugnacious adaptation for Theatre Babel at the Assembly Rooms, deploys them as an instrument of revenge, then murders them. </p> <p>What is startling about Lochhead's version is that Medea emerges as neither superhuman goddess nor foreign witch, more an archetypal example of the wronged woman driven to retaliatory violence. Maureen Beattie endows Medea with a European refugee accent, a vehement dignity and an unusual degree of complicity with the audience. Informing us that women wronged in bed will \"have your guts for garters\", she reaches out to the front row with a terrifying balls-crunching gesture. </p> <p>Beattie's performance has tremendous visceral power and sexual authority. My only cavil about Lochhead's version and Graham McLaren's production is that they mitigate the horror of Medea's infanticide. Medea's justification of their murder - that she is saving them from the hands of her enemies - is treated as a cool political ploy and the play becomes a straightforward feminist endorsement of her actions. But it gains a propulsive contemporaneity that has men in the audience shifting uneasily in their seats. </p> <p>After this, a Danish cabaret version of Lulu, based both on the Wedekind play and the Pabst movie, presented by Odense Internationale Musikteater at the Assembly Rooms, comes as light relief. Chris Jordan's songs have echoes of Weill, Wagner, Bizet, Christmas carols and country-and-western, and the show has a smoky, late-night loucheness. But behind the atmosphere of sophisticated decadence we are reminded that Sonja Richter's Lulu, the sexual free-spirit finally destroyed by Jack the Ripper, is close kin to Nora and Medea. She is the exotic other who sacrifices herself on the altar of male fantasy and suffers accordingly. She also proves that, so far at the Edinburgh fringe this year, it is women who are calling the shots and defining the shits.</p>",

Our favourite couplet went something like this: \"They say he swives women into a trance/So will you when you see his lance.\" The Dairy is no scholar of Restoration comedy, but could it be that no one has staged this play because it's not very good? Strictly for public-school boys and textual analysts. guardiary@excite.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>CRIME DOES PAY</strong></p> <p>Last Friday, cunning Arsene Wenger faxed a take-it-or-leave it offer to Bordeaux for their striker Sylvian Wiltord. And that offer - \u00a37.36m, \u00a38m or \u00a313m depending on which educated guess you chose to believe - came with a strict deadline. Give us Wiltord by Monday, said a poker-faced Wenger, otherwise we'll send Pat Rice to fiddle with your vineyards. And the deal will be off.</p> <p>And who says crime (or at least hard-nose bargaining) doesn't pay? Because according to today's London Evening Standard, Arsenal \"look certain\" to complete Wiltord's transfer this week, with the paper claiming that \"talks have continued and the belief at Highbury is that the French club will accept an offer of \u00a310.5m.\" But are things that clear cut? Remember it's the French we're dealing with here, and the Fiver - who, along with its trusty white van, is a veritable veteran of the Dover to Calais early-morning fags run - knows that you're never safe until you've got the contraband back, safe and sound in Good Ol' Blighty.</p> <p>And what do you know? Despite Arsenal's optimism, Bordeaux chairman Jean-Louis Triaud today told L'Equipe that the deal is far from certain, because he wants to buy a replacement for Wiltord before selling him. \"We are looking for a new player, a forward. But we don't want anyone,\" he said moodily. What kind of player are Bordeaux looking for then? \"In front of goal, we need a killer,\" chirped in Bordeaux coach Elie Baup.

The Fiver wondered what he was up to. Perhaps he was touring around the continent learning from the coaching styles of his peers. Perhaps he's been locked away in his garden shed seeking forgiveness and coming up with some new ways of keeping possession. Or perhaps he's been idling around, learning nothing, and only raising his head to, well, gee up a few horses.</p> <p>Koogan was at Ascot today to do some publicity for the Blue Square Shergar Cup (a horsey version of the Ryder Cup). Koogan will be coaching the European team, and he used today's photo opportunity to draw some parallels between racing and unsuccessful football management. \"If you fall short of your goal you've got to learn lessons. We fell short in Euro 2000, that's a fact, but we know we're better than that,\" Koogan said. \"It's a bit like a horse who ran below par. We can blame the going, we can blame the track or we can blame the jockey, but I'm always reluctant to do that.\" Particularly seeing that the jockey in this analogy is Koog himself.</p> <p>So it seems that while he is desperate to learn lessons, Koogan doesn't want to take any of those on offer, and is more likely to sign up for another OU course in motivational psychology. This does not bode well for England's friendly with double-winners France next month, but Koog doesn't seem to be bothered - what with the geegees in close proximity. \"I'm looking forward to a win to boost me before I pick the England squad,\" he said, clutching a wad of betting slips. \"It's a long time since I lifted a trophy but I'm confident we have the horses and jockeys to win on Saturday.\" So that'll be an easy win for the States, then.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"They should put up or shut up.

Yes, even if that means he'll miss the early stages of the Worthington Cup.</p> <p>\"Those know-alls who have written me off for the Olympics are way off-beam,\" wrote a patriotic Kewell in his Sydney Sunday Telegraph column. \"I always love playing for my country - for Australia - and it's very important for me to also play at home in the Sydney Olympics,\" the player who, along with Mark Viduka, is likely to leave for a pre-Olympics training camp the day after Leeds kick off their season against Everton on August 19th. \"I would like to play but as yet I haven't discussed it with [David O'Leary O'Leeds],\" Kewell said, as if O'Leeds's opinion would make the slightest bit of difference.</p> <p>All this Antipodean activity will mean Leeds doing without two of their biggest stars for up to six weeks (the Olympics don't finish until the beginning of October). Which is tough. But at least Leeds haven't also been knocked back once again in their bid to sign Rio Ferdinand.

People say he was not successful in London but I don't agree - I hope he is as unsuccessful here!\" Leicester manager Peter Taylor has urged Neil Lennon to make his mind up about his future by the end of the week. \"It's in everybody's best interests that Neil makes a decision as quickly as possible,\" Taylor told Leicester's official website. \"I would hope that the situation is resolved by the end of this week.\" Diego Maradona claims he would love to manage some of the biggest clubs in world football. \"I dream of coaching Manchester United or Barcelona,\" he said. \"I also dream of coaching Read Madrid, Boca Juniors or the Argentine national team.\" Aston Villa wing-back Mark Delaney will miss the first month of the season after suffering medial knee ligament damage during Saturday's friendly at non-League Tamworth. Pay-per-view company u&gt;direct will show live coverage of the Big Cup and Euro Vase pre-qualifiers involving Celtic and Rangers this week. They will show the Light Blues' third round qualifier against Herfolge in Denmark on Wednesday night, and 24 hours later they will show Celtic's qualifying game in Luxembourg against Jeunesse Esch.

By affiliating with alumni associations as well as the schools themselves it hopes to keep its users coming back for life.

A lot of money is now coming into the European theatre, and people here are desperately hungry for information about where the deals are, where the money is going. That interest won't go away as the American money won't go away.\"</p> <p>Parsons has been with the Standard since its launch in April 1998 as a mere 64-pager; today the issue size has to be capped at 365 ad-crammed pages \"as the printer can't cope\". He is busy recruiting big names in net journalism for an October launch: Mike Butcher from New Media Age, Chris Nuttall from the BBC and Georgia Cameron-Clarke from the Telegraph will be among 25 journalists working on the European edition under editor James Ledbetter. Up to half of the magazine will comprise material from the US edition, allowing access to the material produced by 130 people in the US. \"The success of First Tuesday shows there's clearly a tremendous interest at a grassroots level about what people can do in their own markets,\" says Parsons. \"We will be a bridge between the experience of the US entrepreneurial and investment community and the rest of Europe. UK web companies are thinking of themselves as European - everything else is provincial.\"</p> <p>Several US net magazines have long been cult items among UK net entrepreneurs, offering the lessons - lately, the mistakes - of west coast start-ups, and hundreds of pages of intimidating advertising from financial institutions boasting of $2bn mergers and follow-on offerings. Comag, the UK's largest magazine importer, now handles 20 internet magazines among its 500 titles. It estimates the internet magazine sector's annual market value at about \u00a311m - compared with \u00a35.6m in March 1999. \"Generally when there is a UK edition we stop importing the US edition as they compete with each other,\" says Sarah Marshall of Comag. \"The arrival of a local edition is a sign that the market is picking up for that sector.\"</p> <p>And picking up it is. Research from Future Publishing points to increasing demand for tech-market coverage in the UK - led by advertisers as well as subscribers. \"The American market is clearly important in this sector because of the development of new technology, but the European market is becoming important in its own right,\" says Jessica Burley, publishing director of Future Publishing's business and internet group, whose titles include Business 2.0, .net and PCPlus. Despite the downturn of tech stocks, venture capital continues to move into Europe in the quest for that successful business model. And that means booming advertising for what Burley calls \"indigenous-facing\" magazines as start-ups - and the banks and software firms seeking their business - try to make noise in their local marketplace. </p> <p>Business 2.0 currently claims a US circulation of 270,000. Future Publishing is guaranteeing advertisers 50,000 for the UK edition's first ABC, and is planning Italian, French and German launches later this year. \"You'll see us roll out the brand into large countries around the world,\" says Burley. Britain, she says, is currently \"an emerging market\" with its own needs. UK consumers may not favour the \"fat books\" of the US titles but we do apparently demand specific coverage of web businesses where Europe appears to be leading the US, notably in mobile technologies.</p> <p>There are clearly risks in localising titles that earned their reputations in the US, where the new economy is still generally held to be months, if not a year, ahead of Britain. The UK version of Wired, backed by the Guardian, folded after what some said was its premature arrival in a market where not enough of note was happening. </p> <p>\"One of the reasons people buy American magazines is to see what's happening in America - but the number of these people is quite small,\" says Richard Lord, editor of Revolution. \"To make a publication succeed in the UK, you need to strike a balance between this and mass-market demands.\" Revolution has recently taken this publishing trend from the other direction: selling its knowledge of the European market to US consumers. Its solution has been to go \"micro-niche\" - focusing purely on internet marketing. An early lesson Revolution learned in New York was that design templates do not travel: \"Americans can't stand sans serif body faces, so they had to go, and we had to increase the leading to improve readability.\" </p> <p>Lord believes Business 2.0 has \"made an admirable attempt to localise itself\" with its UK edition, and is not too bothered about the competition. \"There is a market for us all as long as we realise what we're good at and focus. Red Herring is serving an audience that cares about the financing of companies.\" Besides, Lord notes, there is no sign of a slowdown in the ad market: \"We grew in six months to take weekly what we had taken monthly.\" </p> <p>Keeping up as a reader, however, offers a broader challenge. \"It's simply impossible to read through all this stuff,\" says Mike Nutley, editor of New Media Age - a mere 76 pages this week. \"People value NMA because it's a quick read.

Red Herring is serving an audience that cares about the financing of companies.\" Besides, Lord notes, there is no sign of a slowdown in the ad market: \"We grew in six months to take weekly what we had taken monthly.\" Keeping up as a reader, however, offers a broader challenge. \"It's simply impossible to read through all this stuff,\" says Mike Nutley, editor of New Media Age - a mere 76 pages this week. \"People value NMA because it's a quick read. Who wants telephone-directory-sized magazines?\" \u0095 David Rowan is editor of Guardian Unlimited",

      "body": "<p>Three years ago the BBC set TVs aglow with an extravagant promotional spectacular, the much-celebrated Perfect Day video. The four-minute film starred a glittering cast, from Tom Jones to Elton John, each crooning a segment from the famous Lou Reed track which was then patchworked into a whole. It was dubbed one of 1997's most beautifully crafted \"commercials\", and possibly the creative highlight of the year by ad industry bible Campaign magazine. </p> <p>More importantly, the video was a departure for BBC marketing, the first in a number of lavish, big-budget, generic films promoting sections of its TV and radio - from sports to comedy to education, news, children's programming and music. </p> <p>Then last week, it emerged that the BBC is abandoning the strategy. It is plotting a radical shift in the way it promotes programmes and services, ditching such corporate blockbusters in favour of targeting individual programmes, as well as specific audience groupings. </p> <p>Perfect Day and subsequent branding films such as Curiosity (which plugged its natural history output), Shaggy Dog Story (40 stars from the cream of British comedy telling a joke) and Future Generations (in which a five-year-old boy strolled through the history of kids' TV) have gained numerous creative plaudits and been well-respected by the marketing community. </p> <p>Perfect Day alone won a Gold at Creative Circle in 1998, was a finalist in the corporate image category at Cannes International Advertising Festival and won a silver pencil at D&amp;AD. Future Generations won a silver at D&amp;AD and the BBC overall landed the Marketing Society grand prix of Marketeer of the Year in 1998. So why the comprehensive rethink? </p> <p>Jane Frost, the former controller of corporate and brand marketing responsible for the videos, says: \"We've been running corporate brand campaigns for three or four years and they've been phenomenally successful, but the market changes and our strategy with it. There are more people talking to consumers now and more competitors in the marketplace.\" </p> <p>Industry whispers of an impending strategy shift began when director-general Greg Dyke staged a dramatic overhaul of the marketing department in April, which resulted in Sue Farr's departure as marketing director and put Matthew Bannister, former chief executive of BBC production and controller of Radio 1, in the new board position of director of marketing and communications. </p> <p>Almost a year ago the BBC, for the first time, put responsibility for marketing the BBC brand and its channels and services together under the new banner of BBC public service marketing. Budgeting for the corporate spectaculars began to be pruned, and more was pumped into promoting programmes and channels. Then in February, a review of the BBC's advertising agency roster was announced. Leagas Delaney, its core corporate agency and the creative force behind most of the branding films, was put on alert, alongside its other agencies, the possibility being that the new approach may require less input from external creative sources. </p> <p>Robert Senior, a managing partner at Fallon, which handles Radio 1, says: \"Since Greg and Matthew have come on board, the focus has been on the audience. Everything starts with them and their needs, and works back from that. Inevitably, communications are going to become more rifle-shot against target groups. But there will still be a need for brand footprint work and corporate advertising. They have just turned the telescope round.\" </p> <p>The BBC insists the Perfect Day approach was successful. Industry observers claim it was a timely, adroit reminder to the public of the BBC's stature and creativity. Frost adds: \"There was a sea change in attitude to the BBC, what it was and what it stands for. It was not intended to drive viewers - it was about 'this is us and this is what you're paying for'.\" </p> <p>The films also upped the creative ante, and many of the BBC's commercial rivals have since tweaked their corporate communications tactics and even corporate logos. But there was criticism of the strategy, not least from inside the BBC. \"Those films were lovely to watch, but how could their impact on consumers and the BBC's services be quantified? What were consumers doing differently as a result of them? There was also the thought that we couldn't afford that sort of advertising any more,\" says one insider. </p> <p>It was certainly a controversial approach: rival stations raged at the blatant commercial exploitation of BBC airtime (the films were each about three minutes long) and stoked licence-payer anger about \"abuse\" of their cash. Perfect Day was said to have cost around \u00a32m to make and took more than a year to film. The others were said to be similar \"chequebook productions\". </p> <p>Either way, the focus is now on what viewers are likely to see in the place of these big branding videos, and when. Punters will still be treated to campaigns promoting individual BBC \"services\" such as Radio 1 or BBC1, and there will be the usual appointment-to-view trails plugging specific programmes such as Panorama, \"coming up at 9pm\" or \"a week on Tuesday\". But what of the new umbrella campaigns? </p> <p>The full new marketing blueprint is to be unveiled in October, with the rejigged agency roster announced in November and work to follow soon after. It is likely that the new-look campaigns will be \"service-specific\" (ie to do with one of the radio networks, TV channels or separate programmes) but, crucially, they will be directed at particular segments of the population. \"Audience focus\" is critical and there will be increased \"coherence between campaigns\", says the BBC. There might be, for example, a trail aimed at \"youth\", saying something like, \"If you like Radio 1, you'll also like this programme on BBC2\". </p> <p>\"It's about thinking laterally across the services and about what a Radio 1 listener might also like within the BBC family. It's about leading them seamlessly from one area to another,\" says one source. </p> <p>No doubt there is wisdom in the approach and Bannister and Dyke will hatch a tough, results-oriented strategy. Perhaps the lavish branding work had run out of steam: they'd done comedy, natural history, music and news, so what was left? Some form of broad brush corporate communication will obviously continue, but it seems, to paraphrase the fabled song, we'll just have to keep hanging on for another perfect day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs have today launched details of a \"third way\" out of the vexed issue of foxhunting, aiming to reduce animal welfare concerns while protecting the right to hunt. The cross-party Middle Way Group called for the creation of a new independent hunting authority, which would issue licences for hunting with hounds and enforce a new code of conduct. The proposals are expected to influence a promised government bill which will lay out the various options for MPs to decide upon, ranging from an outright ban to leaving the present laws untouched. Under the Middle Way proposals, a national team of inspectors would make spot checks to ensure that the code, designed to protect animal welfare, was being adhered to. The authority would have the power to punish breaches of the code, including minimum times in which the quarry must be killed, by suspending the licences of offending hunts or individuals and imposing fines of up to \u00a32,000. Hunting without a licence would be a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail. The Middle Way Group, which is jointly chaired by Tory MP Peter Luff, Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik and Labour's Llin Golding, argues that an outright ban would be unenforceable and achieve little in terms of animal welfare, with farmers simply turning to other methods of controlling the fox population which could cause even greater suffering.

      "body": "<p>Katie Tarbox, a young American writer, has been making headlines since May, when her autobiographical book, Katie.com, the story of her seduction by an online paedophile, was published in the US. The book is touted by her publishers as: \"An honest, eye-opening account of a young woman who was bitterly betrayed by the information age.\" </p> <p>But another Katie, this time a Londoner, is feeling bitterly betrayed by Penguin, the book's US publishers. Katie Jones, 28, owns the internet address Katie.com, which since May has been inundated with a flood of attention thanks to Tarbox's book. The victim of an unfortunate case of electronic mistaken identity, she is also the proprietor of UKChat.com, one of the most popular independent chat sites in Britain, generating some 40,000 visitors a day. </p> <p>The book describes in graphic detail how Tarbox met a 41-year-old serial sex offender in an internet chat room, and later met up with him in a Texas hotel room, where he molested her. Penguin's publicity machine won Tarbox a review of the \"cautionary memoir\" in People magazine. The New York Times called it \"a testament to the wonders of the modern adolescent\". CNN called Tarbox on to discuss the dangers of \"cyber-predators\". And America's grande dame of morning talk show hosts, Katie Couric of NBC's Today Show, advised parents and teenagers alike to use the book as a guide of what not to do on the internet. </p> <p>In the space of a single day, Jones' personal website had more than 100,000 visitors, and the south London internet entrepreneur started to get emails from hundreds of Tarbox sympathisers, sharing their own experiences of molestation and rape. Jones, who managed chat services for MSN and AOL before leaving to start her own online chat company in 1998, is worried that the stigma of paedophilia and chat-room abuse addressed in the book will seep over from her personal site into her business activities. </p> <p>\"Lots of people know me as Katie Jones, online community person, and I'm known in this industry as the person who owns and runs UK Chat. Now the domain name is always going to be associated with this book,\" she says. \"It's not mine any more, it's theirs, and they didn't even ask me if they could have it.\" </p> <p>Single-name domains such as Katie.com or Bob.com are increasingly valuable as good, simple web addresses are becoming more difficult to get hold of. Bob.com was recently valued at more than $1m. </p> <p>Katie.com used to house Jones' personal CV, pictures of her young son, and a link to her professional site, UKChat.com. But with the release of the American book, with its disturbing subject matter, Jones has closed the site indefinitely. \"I started getting emails from people wondering if I was [the subject of the book],\" she says. \"The site was attracting the wrong kind of attention from the wrong kind of people.\" </p> <p>Jones, through a US lawyer, contacted the book's publishers to inform them of her prior rights on the name Katie.com, but says the only response was a stiff reply insisting that she had no legal leg to stand on. </p> <p>This isn't the first time that two parties have squabbled over a domain name, but Jones' case is unique in one aspect. There are countless numbers of cyber-squatters who have registered domain names of large companies, and tried to extort large fees from the companies in exchange for relinquishing the names. A whole body of law now addresses the rights of companies to extend their trademark to web addresses. But no one has yet tested the right of web address owners to extend their trademark to other offline media. </p> <p>In November 1999, the US congress passed the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which gave companies recourse against misuse of their trademarks in internet domain names. It expanded previous trademark law in the US, giving better protection against domain name piracy. The trouble for Katie Jones? For starters, Britain doesn't have the same expanded protection against cyber-squatters, and her use of Katie.com isn't a trademark, but for personal use. She is fighting Penguin on the grounds that her privacy has been invaded, rather than trademark infringement. </p> <p>\"It's a grey area of the law.

      "bodyText": "Katie Tarbox, a young American writer, has been making headlines since May, when her autobiographical book, Katie.com, the story of her seduction by an online paedophile, was published in the US. The book is touted by her publishers as: \"An honest, eye-opening account of a young woman who was bitterly betrayed by the information age.\" But another Katie, this time a Londoner, is feeling bitterly betrayed by Penguin, the book's US publishers. Katie Jones, 28, owns the internet address Katie.com, which since May has been inundated with a flood of attention thanks to Tarbox's book. The victim of an unfortunate case of electronic mistaken identity, she is also the proprietor of UKChat.com, one of the most popular independent chat sites in Britain, generating some 40,000 visitors a day. The book describes in graphic detail how Tarbox met a 41-year-old serial sex offender in an internet chat room, and later met up with him in a Texas hotel room, where he molested her. Penguin's publicity machine won Tarbox a review of the \"cautionary memoir\" in People magazine. The New York Times called it \"a testament to the wonders of the modern adolescent\". CNN called Tarbox on to discuss the dangers of \"cyber-predators\". And America's grande dame of morning talk show hosts, Katie Couric of NBC's Today Show, advised parents and teenagers alike to use the book as a guide of what not to do on the internet. In the space of a single day, Jones' personal website had more than 100,000 visitors, and the south London internet entrepreneur started to get emails from hundreds of Tarbox sympathisers, sharing their own experiences of molestation and rape. Jones, who managed chat services for MSN and AOL before leaving to start her own online chat company in 1998, is worried that the stigma of paedophilia and chat-room abuse addressed in the book will seep over from her personal site into her business activities. \"Lots of people know me as Katie Jones, online community person, and I'm known in this industry as the person who owns and runs UK Chat. Now the domain name is always going to be associated with this book,\" she says. \"It's not mine any more, it's theirs, and they didn't even ask me if they could have it.\" Single-name domains such as Katie.com or Bob.com are increasingly valuable as good, simple web addresses are becoming more difficult to get hold of. Bob.com was recently valued at more than $1m. Katie.com used to house Jones' personal CV, pictures of her young son, and a link to her professional site, UKChat.com. But with the release of the American book, with its disturbing subject matter, Jones has closed the site indefinitely. \"I started getting emails from people wondering if I was [the subject of the book],\" she says. \"The site was attracting the wrong kind of attention from the wrong kind of people.\" Jones, through a US lawyer, contacted the book's publishers to inform them of her prior rights on the name Katie.com, but says the only response was a stiff reply insisting that she had no legal leg to stand on. This isn't the first time that two parties have squabbled over a domain name, but Jones' case is unique in one aspect. There are countless numbers of cyber-squatters who have registered domain names of large companies, and tried to extort large fees from the companies in exchange for relinquishing the names. A whole body of law now addresses the rights of companies to extend their trademark to web addresses. But no one has yet tested the right of web address owners to extend their trademark to other offline media. In November 1999, the US congress passed the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, which gave companies recourse against misuse of their trademarks in internet domain names. It expanded previous trademark law in the US, giving better protection against domain name piracy. The trouble for Katie Jones? For starters, Britain doesn't have the same expanded protection against cyber-squatters, and her use of Katie.com isn't a trademark, but for personal use. She is fighting Penguin on the grounds that her privacy has been invaded, rather than trademark infringement. \"It's a grey area of the law. There's no precedent for this,\" she says. \"This is a test case. You don't want to be a test case. It's a horrible thing, but this is an issue that needs addressing.\" Lawyers specialising in internet law say that while Penguin's move may not have been illegal under current law, in today's world, it was certainly clumsy. There's a certain naivety in publishing a book about the internet, with a web address in the title, and publicising the book online (from the website www.KatieT.com), and making no attempt to buy or secure the logical domain name. \"Why would naming the book KatieT.com devalue it in any way?\" Jones asks.

Books: OK, my favourite book is one which helped me understand yoga in a really beautiful way - Awakening the Spine, by Vanda Scaravelli. At the moment I'm reading The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, which is a guide to spiritual enlightenment. But it's diluted Buddhism and all too yankee-doodle-day for me. I'm also reading Alain de Botton's Essays in Love. I think he's cool. And Jackie Kay's Trumpet. Film: Last film I saw was Being John Malkovich. I liked the idea of portals that led you into the mind. There was a parallel with how people treated me when I came out of Big Brother, because they think they own you and know all about you. I absolutely love Doctor Zhivago and Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse - meaning \"The beautiful troublemaker\", which I thought was quite fitting. I'm also a fan of Francois Truffaut and Woody Allen. Television: My favourite show is Blouse and Skirt. It's a black comedy show and it's just too funny. I also love Smack the Pony and Ali G. Absolutely loathe gameshows and docusoaps, ironically enough. Radio: Radio 4, because it's soothing. They had my yoga teacher on. And Kiss FM for light reggae in the late mornings. Ads: The gridlock one, I think for Malibu. Two black guys in the Caribbean and the voice-over says: \"It's a gridlock\". It's really funny. And the Motorola mobile phone ad. Multimedia: Don't own any of it. Sada Walkington, the first Big Brother evictee, is co-author of the forthcoming The Babes' Bible",

I don't think I snort.\" </p> <p>We are talking, of course, about the 56-year old's habits as presenter of Radio 4's Today programme. Snorting is on the agenda since Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, complained to the BBC about a series of interruptions and unwelcome noises made by Humphrys during an interview in February. The BBC programme complaints unit (PCU) last week ruled in favour of Robertson, adding: \"The tone of questioning was inappropriate at times, and the frequency of interruption was ill-judged.\" </p> <p>By the time I reach him, Humphrys is well and truly reeling from the reporting of his reprimand. He uses words like \"childish\" and \"silly\" to describe a Guardian leader dedicated to the issue and his claws are out. \"Yes, can we start getting a few facts here?\" he says abrasively, when I ask for his side of the story. The suggestion by the Telegraph that Lord Robertson was justified in thinking Humphrys used the interview as a platform for his own views has more than agitated him: \"They rejected the claim,\" he says, before repeating slowly: \"They specifically rejected the complaint that I used the interview as a platform for my own views. I was not doing that, I was putting to George Robertson the views of other people. That is what I'm paid to do.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, a gentle slap of the Humphrys wrist has been executed. Does he feel repentant at all? \"The PCU is entitled to its view,\" he says with the same kind of question evasion you'd expect from some of his more adept guests. \"It was certainly a robust interview, it didn't strike me as any more robust than a hundred other interviews I've done, but it's a matter of judgment and in the judgment of the PCU I overstepped the mark. Well, they're entitled to their view. So be it.\" He says it so abruptly you'd think that the faceless figures behind the PCU (not the BBC governors as reported, Humphrys is quick to point out) have done the undoable: rattled him. </p> <p>Not according to Humphrys they haven't. \"I mean, I'm not bothered about it,\" he is quick to add. \"Had it been as was reported in the newspapers, had the governors reprimanded me because I used the interview as a platform for my own opinions, that would have been a very serious matter indeed. I would have to consider my position, as would the BBC governors. And if there was evidence that the public thought I had overstepped the mark and if that happened consistently then that would be serious too. In this event neither of those things happened.\" </p> <p>The message is clear: Humphrys may be on the ropes, but his predicament is little more than an uneasy wobble. Throughout our conversation he frequently suggests his own dismissal - \"If the public thinks that I'm getting it wrong then the BBC should get rid of me\" - with the confidence of a man who knows he is safe in his job. It's hardly a surprise. Humphrys is a hydra: cut off one of his heads and he'll grow back stronger. After Jonathan Aitken labelled him \"rude, interruptive and partisan\", there was a surge in audience support for him. And in 1993, when he and Jeremy Paxman were criticised by the BBC governors for being too aggressive, the public responded by voting Humphrys one of their favourite presenters and the Today programme notched up a Sony award. </p> <p>But recently questions of his objectivity have come into play. In regularly penning a column for the Sunday Times some see his ready acceptance of the Murdoch shilling as eroding his impartiality. Humphrys disagrees. \"I suppose if you take the view that journalists shouldn't work for four of the biggest circulation newspapers in Britain then that's fine, but I think it's slightly odd.\" There is no conflict of interest, he says. \"I do not express political opinions and nobody would be able to judge from my columns what my political views are. The BBC does not require its presenters not to have any views on anything, it requires its presenters not to make their own political views explicit, for very obvious reasons.\" </p> <p>With the majority of politicians on-side it's clearly a skill Humphrys has mastered. \"Far be it for me to be hugely immodest but I was voted political journalist of the year by politicians this year,\" he reminds me. \"I mean, it's a bit bizarre that the very people whom I am supposed to mercilessly pillory and savagely and ceaselessly attack should vote for me voluntarily in competition with every political hack in Britain. They can't think that I'm such an ogre.\" </p> <p>Still, words like \"rottweiler\", \"pugnacious\" and \"biting\" appear throughout articles dedicated to the broadcaster, alongside references to the time he interrupted Ken Clarke 32 times and the encounter when he reduced Harriet Harman to a quivering wreck. It's an image he doesn't wholly embrace. \"That's the trouble. Once you get a couple of high-profile stories or attacks on you for your style of interviewing then you're saddled with that forever. The truth is if you listen to the overwhelming body of my work then you'd find that the majority of interviews that I do are free from interruptions.\" </p> <p>John Birt was not a fan of the confrontational style and famously launched an attack on sneering interviewers (from which Humphrys was neatly excluded with a handwritten letter saying that it was not actually him that got Birt's goat). But Humphrys will not be drawn on the subject of his new director-general. \"It's early days,\" he says, \" and I have absolutely no way of knowing what Greg's view of my sort of interviewing is. I think Greg has far too much on his hands at the moment to worry about whether Humphrys is asking rude questions on the Today programme.\" </p> <p>Which brings us back to \"this business with George Robertson\", as Humphrys likes to label it, and how the public have responded. \"For what it's worth we've had a very large numbers of emails and faxes and so far about 95% have said: 'What on earth does the BBC think it's playing at?' They are cross that Robertson complained and they take the view that this is what the business of interviewing is about.\" </p> <p>It is for Humphrys, anyway. \"It would be a pretty bizarre and pathetically inadequate interview if all I ever did was politely question: 'Mr Brown, have you ever done this?' Or: 'Mr Brown, do you believe every pensioner in Britain is happy with their pension?' Yes, I could do an interview like that. Equally I could work on Blue Peter.\" Could he? \"Well, I haven't been asked recently. Apparently it's because I don't look good enough in a skirt.

      "body": "<p>Bob Shennan, the new controller of Radio 5 Live, is making it very clear, in his quiet but insistent manner, that he has indeed landed his dream job. \"I feel I've been in training for it since I joined the BBC. I wanted it. It doesn't come up very often.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live has never looked back since the high-profile relaunch by Jenny Abramsky six years ago, and Shennan is only the third controller of the highly rated sports and news network, which now attracts more than 6m listeners a week. </p> <p>Abramsky, now reaping the rewards of her endeavours as director of BBC Radio (the most senior manager), first handed the baton over to the canny Roger Mosey - like her, a former editor of Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Mosey, backed up by executives such as Steve Kyte, has introduced a range of changes, including the versatile Nicky Campbell in the mornings. But then the competition suddenly became more fierce, and more vociferous, as Kelvin MacKenzie's Talksport switched its priorities from chat to sport, in an attempt to woo advertiser-friendly, cash-rich young males. </p> <p>The thing that distinguishes Shennan from his two predecessors is that instead of coming from a news background he is a sports expert through and through - well versed in the tricky radio sports-rights market and in handling sporting stars. </p> <p>\"Just as Roger Mosey was absolutely the right person after Jenny - even though it was predominantly driven in audience terms by sport - I think I'm the right person now. I don't think it really matters what people's backgrounds are. It's how they want to move the radio station forward.\" </p> <p>At 38, he is swapping that unhappy billet, head of BBC sport production for television and radio, for the pleasure of running a service still in possession of the crown jewels of sport. And he is doing so as the BBC news empire loses control of 5 Live, allowing it to slot in alongside the other four national radio channels under Abramsky. This, says Shennan, represents a perfect opportunity for the station to redefine itself. \"I want Radio 5 Live to feel like a real radio station, not a BBC network made up of two strands, news and sport. </p> <p>\"When people come in to work here, I want them to feel they are working for 5 Live, as they do in Radio 1 and Radio 2. I want to blur the edges, smooth out the gear changes for listeners,\" he adds, referring to the abrupt shifts between hot news inputs and live sport. \"There is a bumpy sound to some parts of the schedule.\" </p> <p>The tension of being a hybrid and having to play two roles can't entirely be wished away with snazzier jingles or more sports news programmes. But Shennan sees strength coming from melding the two elements more carefully. For example, drive-time's Peter Allen co-presented the Open from St Andrews last month, and the breakfast show was broadcast from there in much the same way that the Today programme moves to Brussels or Washington for key political events. </p> <p>Over the past 18 months or so, Shennan notes approvingly that there's been a push to beef up the role of sports news. \"It's about making sure the whole of the radio station recognises the value of sport. I don't want there to be a sense that there are times when sport switches on and everyone in news goes home, or vice versa. It does happen. It's a very, very ambitious network with diverse tones of voice,\" he says. </p> <p>Shennan, educated at Lancaster grammar school, joined the BBC from Cambridge University armed with an English degree and a stint at Radio Hereward. A radio sports trainee, he rose to become head of radio sport as the first, unsuccessful version of Radio 5 Live stumbled onto the air. He is surprised at how slow the commercial operators were in the early days to spot the potential of radio sport. </p> <p>Given this pedigree, it is hardly surprising that Shennan is less keen on by-elections, prime minister's questions and rolling news. The news wing of Radio 5 is making fearful noises in private. Shennan, however, claims they have nothing to worry about. \"There is not going to be a huge shift or a dramatic move away from news. I want to evolve the station, not revolutionise it.\" </p> <p>Indeed, with digital radio expansion still some years away, 5 Live is unlikely to eliminate news or a commitment to breaking stories, such as the Paddington rail crash or by-election declarations. \"My role is to build a sense of one radio station. I want to make a strength of the fact that we have these two distinctive strands.\" </p> <p>The question of competition, specifically in the form of MacKenzie's Talksport, is one that he is keen to bring up: \"I am very alive to the challenges we face.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live gave an early demonstration of this new awareness when it finally took action this summer against Talksport's practice of covering events to which the BBC owned exclusive rights. After a year of hand-wringing, lawyers were employed when Talksport commentated on televised Euro 2000 matches. </p> <p>\"It's very sensible for the BBC to protect its investment, and increasingly, rights-holders will be pleased, rather than having to take action themselves. I see Euro 2000 as quite straightforward. We bought the rights to broadcast live and exclusive, and Talksport was not around when the whole process was negotiated. </p> <p>\"There were no national sports broadcasters when we launched. There certainly are now. Inevitably, we are challenged. The key part of our strategy is going to be maintaining that portfolio [of sports rights] in every way we can.\" </p> <p>Radio 5 Live, he agrees, already has a healthy budget of \u00a365m. Will it get more? It sounds possible. Negotiations are just opening for radio rights to the Premiership - 5 Live has them for one more year. </p> <p>\"We have to make sure we maintain the integrity of the output. We will bid competitively for Premier League rights. Holding on is very important for us,\" promises Shennan. </p> <p>But, as he points out, 5 Live has done well (certainly far better than television) in holding on to the crown jewels - cricket, the Open, Six Nations rugby, formula one and the FA Cup. </p> <p>But he could be inheriting the station as it peaks: \"There is still potential; it could go further. It will depend on a number of things working in our favour. Maybe sports audiences are quite close to their maximum.\" </p> <p>The key, therefore, is probably more attractive news programming and fresh thinking. Nurturing articulate sports stars with a background in professional sport is one of Shennan's pet projects. \"I want to develop new, key talent,\" he says. He points to the way Gary Lineker, Steve Cram and Clare Balding have been brought on. </p> <p>\"I want to introduce new voices. Ian Wright and Mark Bright - now that could be a strong team.\" He goes on to praise John Inverdale, one of Radio 5 Live's stars, who has been tempted across to television. \"He's not going to disappear - he's very symbolic of what 5 Live is about. He's a terrific journalist, with all-round knowledge, and a wonderful tone of voice.\" </p> <p>What Shennan's appointment means for David Mellor's Football 606 - already moved from its Saturday slot - is less clear. \"He's been a tremendous success at 5 Live. He's been here a long time, and he'll do it for the next season. But it's always my job to think about the future and refresh things.\" </p> <p> <strong>'No-one else does it'</strong></p> <p><strong> March 1994</strong><br> Five months after being given the go-ahead, Radio 5 Live is launched with a new 24-hour news and sports format, replacing BBC Radio 5. \"Nobody else does it,\" says its controller, Jenny Abramsky. Its \u00a330.2m budget includes an unprecedented \u00a31m advertising allowance. Personality presenters such as Ian Botham and David Mellor are among extra staff recruited. </p> <p><strong> August 1994</strong><br> First detailed listening figures show a gain of 500,000 listeners over 5 Live's predecessor, with 4.7m tuning in each week. </p> <p><strong> February 1995</strong><br> Talk Radio UK is launched, competing for the same listeners. </p> <p><strong> April 1996</strong><br> Radio 5 Live is named UK station of the year at the Sony Radio awards for its sports broadcasting in particular - \"so engaging that it makes listeners feel they are actually there at the event itself\". Sport provides the largest audience, with up to 800,000 listeners. </p> <p><strong> October 1996</strong><br> The editor of the Today programme, Roger Mosey, is appointed new controller of 5 Live. </p> <p><strong> March 1997</strong><br> Football presenter Danny Baker is fired for urging listeners to doorstep a referee and make his life hell. Talk Radio signs him up. </p> <p><strong> March 1997</strong><br> The audience for 5 Live's breakfast programme has risen to one-third of Today's 5m. Its listeners are younger, more regional and less upmarket. </p> <p><strong> December 1997</strong><br> \"There's enough sport around not only for 5 Live, but for us too,\" says the boss of Talk Radio, Peter Robinson. </p> <p><strong> April 1999</strong><br> Radio 5 Live loses winter Test cricket rights to Talk Radio. However, it has 5.2m listeners a week, up from 4.7m in April 1994. </p> <p><strong> August 2000</strong><br> Figures show a fall from 5 Live's record reach of 6.2m in the previous quarter to 5.8m. Slight share fall from 4.4% to 4.1%. Moves under Jenny Abramsky's control.</p>",

This, says Shennan, represents a perfect opportunity for the station to redefine itself. \"I want Radio 5 Live to feel like a real radio station, not a BBC network made up of two strands, news and sport. \"When people come in to work here, I want them to feel they are working for 5 Live, as they do in Radio 1 and Radio 2. I want to blur the edges, smooth out the gear changes for listeners,\" he adds, referring to the abrupt shifts between hot news inputs and live sport. \"There is a bumpy sound to some parts of the schedule.\" The tension of being a hybrid and having to play two roles can't entirely be wished away with snazzier jingles or more sports news programmes. But Shennan sees strength coming from melding the two elements more carefully. For example, drive-time's Peter Allen co-presented the Open from St Andrews last month, and the breakfast show was broadcast from there in much the same way that the Today programme moves to Brussels or Washington for key political events. Over the past 18 months or so, Shennan notes approvingly that there's been a push to beef up the role of sports news. \"It's about making sure the whole of the radio station recognises the value of sport. I don't want there to be a sense that there are times when sport switches on and everyone in news goes home, or vice versa. It does happen. It's a very, very ambitious network with diverse tones of voice,\" he says. Shennan, educated at Lancaster grammar school, joined the BBC from Cambridge University armed with an English degree and a stint at Radio Hereward. A radio sports trainee, he rose to become head of radio sport as the first, unsuccessful version of Radio 5 Live stumbled onto the air. He is surprised at how slow the commercial operators were in the early days to spot the potential of radio sport. Given this pedigree, it is hardly surprising that Shennan is less keen on by-elections, prime minister's questions and rolling news. The news wing of Radio 5 is making fearful noises in private. Shennan, however, claims they have nothing to worry about. \"There is not going to be a huge shift or a dramatic move away from news. I want to evolve the station, not revolutionise it.\" Indeed, with digital radio expansion still some years away, 5 Live is unlikely to eliminate news or a commitment to breaking stories, such as the Paddington rail crash or by-election declarations. \"My role is to build a sense of one radio station. I want to make a strength of the fact that we have these two distinctive strands.\" The question of competition, specifically in the form of MacKenzie's Talksport, is one that he is keen to bring up: \"I am very alive to the challenges we face.\" Radio 5 Live gave an early demonstration of this new awareness when it finally took action this summer against Talksport's practice of covering events to which the BBC owned exclusive rights. After a year of hand-wringing, lawyers were employed when Talksport commentated on televised Euro 2000 matches. \"It's very sensible for the BBC to protect its investment, and increasingly, rights-holders will be pleased, rather than having to take action themselves. I see Euro 2000 as quite straightforward. We bought the rights to broadcast live and exclusive, and Talksport was not around when the whole process was negotiated. \"There were no national sports broadcasters when we launched. There certainly are now. Inevitably, we are challenged. The key part of our strategy is going to be maintaining that portfolio [of sports rights] in every way we can.\" Radio 5 Live, he agrees, already has a healthy budget of \u00a365m. Will it get more? It sounds possible. Negotiations are just opening for radio rights to the Premiership - 5 Live has them for one more year. \"We have to make sure we maintain the integrity of the output. We will bid competitively for Premier League rights. Holding on is very important for us,\" promises Shennan. But, as he points out, 5 Live has done well (certainly far better than television) in holding on to the crown jewels - cricket, the Open, Six Nations rugby, formula one and the FA Cup. But he could be inheriting the station as it peaks: \"There is still potential; it could go further. It will depend on a number of things working in our favour. Maybe sports audiences are quite close to their maximum.\" The key, therefore, is probably more attractive news programming and fresh thinking. Nurturing articulate sports stars with a background in professional sport is one of Shennan's pet projects. \"I want to develop new, key talent,\" he says. He points to the way Gary Lineker, Steve Cram and Clare Balding have been brought on. \"I want to introduce new voices. Ian Wright and Mark Bright - now that could be a strong team.\" He goes on to praise John Inverdale, one of Radio 5 Live's stars, who has been tempted across to television. \"He's not going to disappear - he's very symbolic of what 5 Live is about. He's a terrific journalist, with all-round knowledge, and a wonderful tone of voice.\" What Shennan's appointment means for David Mellor's Football 606 - already moved from its Saturday slot - is less clear. \"He's been a tremendous success at 5 Live. He's been here a long time, and he'll do it for the next season. But it's always my job to think about the future and refresh things.\" 'No-one else does it' March 1994 Five months after being given the go-ahead, Radio 5 Live is launched with a new 24-hour news and sports format, replacing BBC Radio 5. \"Nobody else does it,\" says its controller, Jenny Abramsky. Its \u00a330.2m budget includes an unprecedented \u00a31m advertising allowance. Personality presenters such as Ian Botham and David Mellor are among extra staff recruited. August 1994 First detailed listening figures show a gain of 500,000 listeners over 5 Live's predecessor, with 4.7m tuning in each week. February 1995 Talk Radio UK is launched, competing for the same listeners. April 1996 Radio 5 Live is named UK station of the year at the Sony Radio awards for its sports broadcasting in particular - \"so engaging that it makes listeners feel they are actually there at the event itself\". Sport provides the largest audience, with up to 800,000 listeners. October 1996 The editor of the Today programme, Roger Mosey, is appointed new controller of 5 Live. March 1997 Football presenter Danny Baker is fired for urging listeners to doorstep a referee and make his life hell. Talk Radio signs him up. March 1997 The audience for 5 Live's breakfast programme has risen to one-third of Today's 5m. Its listeners are younger, more regional and less upmarket. December 1997 \"There's enough sport around not only for 5 Live, but for us too,\" says the boss of Talk Radio, Peter Robinson. April 1999 Radio 5 Live loses winter Test cricket rights to Talk Radio. However, it has 5.2m listeners a week, up from 4.7m in April 1994. August 2000 Figures show a fall from 5 Live's record reach of 6.2m in the previous quarter to 5.8m. Slight share fall from 4.4% to 4.1%. Moves under Jenny Abramsky's control.",

Sure, the day had started well enough: \"It's the crack of dawn and we're barbequeing - Oh, I'm so excited!\" Jordan squealed for what must have been the 10th time in a television minute, as she and the eight remaining humiliation hunters waited for Big Brother to turn on the hot water at 7am. </p> <p>But it wasn't long before the harsh reality began to dawn on the 27-year-old former stripper from Minneapolis: she was about to become the second contestant banished from the US camera- and microphone-infested house. \"I could have looked so much better,\" she whined later that day, as voyeur-voters around the country were phoning in on Wednesday with the ugly truth. \"Look, my abs are gone,\" she said, pulling up her shirt for the two-way mirror. </p> <p>Some 78% of the audience apparently agreed, and the birthday girl was banished - no doubt straight from CBS primetime television to the pages of Playboy, where the latest bikini-clad evictee from the CBS sister show, Survivor, 23-year-old Jenna Lewis, looks set to show off her naked ambition for a reported $500,000. </p> <p>Smiling bravely as she hugged her housemates goodbye, Jordan seemed less sure of her own prospects as she was debriefed moments later by Big Brother, otherwise known as the CBS morning news anchor Julie Chen (it's her voice those still in the house hear), her own reputation compromised by her network's ratings-driven blurring of the lines between news and \"reality\" entertainment. Would Jordan consider posing for a nude photo-spread? \"I'd consider it,\" Jordan told her, \"but the chances are close to none.\" </p> <p>Indeed, punters may already have seen enough of Jordan. During the programme, viewers saw plenty of the topless club where she had danced for two years. \"She'll be back,\" predicted her old colleague Blake. \"She hasn't cleaned out her locker.\" </p> <p>But Americans, it seems, can't get enough of \"reality\" fare. Network audiences overwhelmingly opted for the Survivor castaways and Big Brother housemates over the more stage-managed offerings of the Republican National Convention last week - zapping CBS to another ratings high as coverage of the convention slipped to the week's lowest viewing figures. </p> <p>Wednesday's live hour of Big Brother drew in 17.4m viewers, suggesting George W Bush would have been better advised to take a cameo role in the hit series. \"It's pretty hard to compete,\" admitted one Republican pollster. </p> <p>One can only imagine how flush with cash the estate of George Orwell might have been if the man who coined the phrase Big Brother had been able to stretch his imagination beyond 1984. If he'd really seen into the future, he might have registered it as a brand. Just think of the millions being made from all the voyeurs around the world now hooked on the mundane antics of all the supposedly \"ordinary\" fame and fortune hunters. </p> <p>Here in the US, CBS paid $20m just to buy the rights to the Big Brother TV format from its Dutch originators Endemol. And the investment is paying a handsome dividend for the once-struggling network: it is winning back the young viewers so coveted by national advertisers. But at a big price: the credibility of its once vaunted news division is in question, as it stuffs its news broadcasts with the latest \"news\" from the Survivor and Big Brother sets. </p> <p>Every Thursday morning, the network's struggling breakfast news programme, The Early Show, devotes almost an hour of its airtime to the latest developments on Survivor, including a half-hour panel discussion and the first interview with the latest cutie cast adrift by his or her tropical island rivals as they compete for the coveted $1m prize. </p> <p>As for Big Brother, Early Show newsreader Chen also hosts a half-hour primetime interview with every week's Big Brother cast-off, along with her new-found acting role as the voice of Big Brother. She then hosts a long segment on The Early Show every Friday morning to discuss the previous night's banishment; and on Monday mornings, after a weekend of compulsory psychological counselling, the exiled cast member is flown to the CBS news studio in New York for the first interview. </p> <p>And as if all that blatant cross-promotion weren't enough, CBS's local radio and TV stations have been breathlessly reporting on the latest developments on the two shows - sometimes leading their bulletins with them, even when there is real news of the traditional, important kind, be it from the Middle East peace negotiations at Camp David or the campaign trail. </p> <p>Not that any of that concerns the suits at CBS. Even the network news president Andrew Heyward can defend it with a straight face. \"It's an experiment well worth taking on,\" he says. \"I understand the traditional view that says we shouldn't do something like this, but I'm very comfortable with it.\" </p> <p>CBS, which spent $30m on a revamp of its morning news show last autumn only to lose yet more viewers to NBC's Today and ABC's Good Morning America, admits it had become desperate. \"We were really struggling, but now we've won over hundreds of thousands of new viewers,\" says The Early Show's executive producer Steve Friedman. </p> <p>US media watchdogs may grumble, but their words have little impact in a celebrity-driven culture where the news agenda is increasingly dictated by profit margins. The difference from Orwell's nightmare is that viewers can always tune out, says CBS. But as long as millions tune in and log on for a daily dose of the banal, household chores and petty bickering will continue to pass for breaking news. If it makes money, it makes the news. </p> <p>Everyone, it seems, wants to play the fame game, or at the very least, live vicariously through those who succeed at it, for whatever dubious reason. </p> <p>And although there is mounting evidence to suggest Americans are increasingly alarmed by online invasions into their privacy, thousands are still flocking to audition for the growing number of so-called \"reality shows\" now monopolising the airwaves. Few seem to feel in any way compromised by being spied on, or uncomfortable about spying on others in a culture where un-earned and accidental celebrity is becoming a way of life. </p> <p>Even Jeffrey Rosen, whose new book, The Unwanted Gaze, defines the perils to privacy brought by the digital age, seems unfazed by the Big Brother phenomenon. \"It's silly to huff and puff about watching lurid television. It's a human impulse,\" he says, adding that the embarrassing exhibitionism of the contestants, even to the point of prime-time national humiliation, is understandable in the post-Monicagate era. </p> <p>\"Being on TV is now seen as more important than being a good citizen,\" Rosen recently told the New York Times. \"Bill Clinton showed that in a culture of exposure, shamelessness is a self-defence; no amount of bad behaviour is embarrassing as long as you continue to be on television. The distinction between fame and infamy has been eradicated.\" </p> <p>And banished along with it, so it would seem, is the distinction between reality and unreality. Come November when Americans go to the polls to elect their next president, it will be interesting to see how many of those voting each week in the Big Brother popularity contest actually show up at the polling booth that really matters.</p>",

It's a human impulse,\" he says, adding that the embarrassing exhibitionism of the contestants, even to the point of prime-time national humiliation, is understandable in the post-Monicagate era. \"Being on TV is now seen as more important than being a good citizen,\" Rosen recently told the New York Times. \"Bill Clinton showed that in a culture of exposure, shamelessness is a self-defence; no amount of bad behaviour is embarrassing as long as you continue to be on television. The distinction between fame and infamy has been eradicated.\" And banished along with it, so it would seem, is the distinction between reality and unreality. Come November when Americans go to the polls to elect their next president, it will be interesting to see how many of those voting each week in the Big Brother popularity contest actually show up at the polling booth that really matters.",

Until the result of November 7's American polls is known, neither Republican candidate George W Bush, nor his Democratic rival, Al Gore, are likely to show any flexibility. The main problem for the Americans and the British is a moral one. It is fairly clear that after 10 years, the sanctions regime has achieved little or nothing in political or military terms. But as the protesters point out, while that impasse may not matter very much as long as peace is maintained in the region, the sanctions continue to cause horrific suffering among Iraq's civilian population. A Unicef report published last year said that in many areas of Iraq mortality rates among children under five years have more than doubled since 1990. Iraq itself says 1.5 million Iraqis, young and old, have died as a result of sanctions, largely caused by the collapse of Iraq's health services, sanitation, resulting diseases, and by poor nutrition. President Saddam's henchmen, the army, and Iraq's wealthy elite, who carry the principal responsibility for the Gulf war, have not suffered in this way, of course. Instead, say the protesters, it is the Iraqi people who pay the price of a continuing, pointless deadlock. It would be nice to say that this situation will change soon. But with the positions of both sides entrenched, there is at present no prospect of a breakthrough. And there may be yet more, gloomy anniversaries to come.",

We caught up with him after the match against Derbyshire had ended in a draw and asked him to talk us through his first-innings performance.</em></p> <p>\"I started off on a good note. The left-hander [Steve Stubbings] moved back and across to the first ball and was caught at gully. The ball was on the money - I always try to make 'em play first up. In fact, I make all the batsmen play a lot more now and it's worked - from averaging 22-23 I'm averaging around 14 this year.</p> <p>\"[Michael] Di Venuto played a few shots in his innings - it was like watching the highlights at times - but I bowled one closer to the stumps on middle-and-leg, it seamed away and was nicked to Kenway [Derek, the wicketkeeper]. The one I got Steve Titchard with was the second-best ball of my career: I'd moved round the wicket and bowled two successive inswingers before the Magic Ball, which seamed back in and clipped off stump. I reckon the best ball of my career was the one I bowled today to the night-watchman [to Kevin Dean in the second innings on Saturday]. Warnie came over and said, \"Al, the Magic Ball.\" It was a round-the-wicket inswinger to the left-hander - I went for gold and clipped off stump.</p> <p>\"For Rob Bailey [in the first innings] there was a similar ball. He looked to get forward, but he edged it. Sutton reached 36 [having put on 91 with Mathew Dowman] before I got him with an over-the-wicket ball which he tried to drive, but just nicked to second slip [Laney]. Paul Aldred was over the wicket again, an inswinger that hit middle stump. Shah's wicket was a regular ball - on the left-hander's off-stump - and he hit it straight to the Judge [Robin Smith] at mid-on. Tim Munton was bowled with an inswinger on off-stump and to finish it off I bowled Dean, another left-hander, through the gate.</p> <p>\"The only wicket I didn't get was Dowman, but I had him dropped four times, twice before 19! But you never know - if I'd got him out, someone else might have come on and taken a couple of wickets later on, so you can't necessarily say I'd have got all ten. I did get him out though! [laughs] I went for a few, but I bowled quite a lot of overs in the innings and I had a decent strike rate, something like a wicket every four overs. It's a shame we dropped the catches we did - they probably cost us the game.</p> <p>\"I got five more today [in the second innings, for 95] which is good - I'm here to win trophies and gain respect from the lads. You speak to Warnie, he'll tell you that pressure is just the fear of failure. You've just got to accept that you have better days than others, and the lads here know I'm always trying my best. In fact, I'm in the best form of my career at the moment - Robin Smith will tell you how much I've improved. I'm enjoying my cricket now and I'm much more relaxed. Hampshire are looking after me and I love living by the water - it's all adding to the success.</p> <p>\"I like playing with Warne - I was playing for Victoria in 1990 when he made his debut. He gets a lot of bad press but I'll tell you this: he's one of the nicest blokes you'll ever meet. The Aussies should regard him as a national treasure. He's just one of the lads, but because he's very recognisable it's hard for him to relax. He's a great bloke, but it could be Australia's downfall to treat him the way they have done [Warne was stripped of the Australian vice-captaincy last week]. You never know what you've got till it's gone. All the press were here, but Warne doesn't need the aggro. He's lost the vice-captaincy for an incident that's not even worth mentioning. If Australia weren't so good at the moment, they might treat him differently.</p> <p>\"If we'd won this game, it could have been a turning point in our season. We've got a decent attack, but it's uncanny how we haven't made enough runs - we would be in the top four if we had. But, with two divisions, the challenge is to stay in Division One. We've got the passion, drive and commitment and I reckon next year we'll do better. But, you know, to get to the NatWest semis, the B&amp;H quarters, the top six in the National League and to stay up in the Championship - it's not that bad a year.</p> <p>\"As for a Test call, I don't even focus on it. But, I'm in the best form of my life and though I'm not a big man for stats, I know I've taken around 33-34 wickets in five games at 13 apiece and there have been no seamer-friendly pitches either. It's an honour and a privilege to play for England, but I'll just carry on doing my best. If I can improve like Andy Caddick has, I'll be happy. Whatever accolades you get along the way are just a bonus.\"</p> <p><em>Alan Mullally was talking to Matthew Hancock.

But you never know - if I'd got him out, someone else might have come on and taken a couple of wickets later on, so you can't necessarily say I'd have got all ten. I did get him out though! [laughs] I went for a few, but I bowled quite a lot of overs in the innings and I had a decent strike rate, something like a wicket every four overs. It's a shame we dropped the catches we did - they probably cost us the game. \"I got five more today [in the second innings, for 95] which is good - I'm here to win trophies and gain respect from the lads. You speak to Warnie, he'll tell you that pressure is just the fear of failure. You've just got to accept that you have better days than others, and the lads here know I'm always trying my best. In fact, I'm in the best form of my career at the moment - Robin Smith will tell you how much I've improved. I'm enjoying my cricket now and I'm much more relaxed. Hampshire are looking after me and I love living by the water - it's all adding to the success. \"I like playing with Warne - I was playing for Victoria in 1990 when he made his debut. He gets a lot of bad press but I'll tell you this: he's one of the nicest blokes you'll ever meet. The Aussies should regard him as a national treasure. He's just one of the lads, but because he's very recognisable it's hard for him to relax. He's a great bloke, but it could be Australia's downfall to treat him the way they have done [Warne was stripped of the Australian vice-captaincy last week]. You never know what you've got till it's gone. All the press were here, but Warne doesn't need the aggro. He's lost the vice-captaincy for an incident that's not even worth mentioning. If Australia weren't so good at the moment, they might treat him differently. \"If we'd won this game, it could have been a turning point in our season. We've got a decent attack, but it's uncanny how we haven't made enough runs - we would be in the top four if we had. But, with two divisions, the challenge is to stay in Division One. We've got the passion, drive and commitment and I reckon next year we'll do better. But, you know, to get to the NatWest semis, the B&amp;H quarters, the top six in the National League and to stay up in the Championship - it's not that bad a year. \"As for a Test call, I don't even focus on it. But, I'm in the best form of my life and though I'm not a big man for stats, I know I've taken around 33-34 wickets in five games at 13 apiece and there have been no seamer-friendly pitches either. It's an honour and a privilege to play for England, but I'll just carry on doing my best. If I can improve like Andy Caddick has, I'll be happy. Whatever accolades you get along the way are just a bonus.\" Alan Mullally was talking to Matthew Hancock.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of troops have been deployed across the western United States as hundreds of wildfires yesterday burned out of control, apparently impervious to bombardments by flying water tankers attempting to halt the blaze. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton is due to visit areas stricken by what has been described as the worst outbreak of forest fires in half a century. The government is spending $15m a day (about \u00a310m) to support 20,000 civilian and military firefighters from 46 states and Canada. </p> <p>The national interagency fire centre (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, reported yesterday that there were now more than 70 large fires engulfing more than 750,000 acres in 11 states, notably Montana, California, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming. </p> <p>Officials are alarmed that the blazes have come earlier than the usual fire season and that they are proving more difficult to contain. Some of the fires are thought to be so well established that they will only be extinguished by the arrival of snow in October or November. </p> <p>\"The northern Rockies is the hottest place in the country at the moment,\" said Lynn Pisano-Pedigo of the NIFC yesterday. She cited \"dry lightning\" as one of the main causes of the latest outbreak. </p> <p>The weather conditions that produce dry lightning are expected to continue for several weeks - a combination of high temperatures, low humidity and rainless thunderstorms. </p> <p>Temperatures have also been at record highs in many areas. Weather officials report \"triple digit\" temperatures in central California, making the land even more susceptible to the blazes. </p> <p>Hamilton in Montana is at the centre of the main blazes and yesterday residents were warned to remain indoors because of the thick smoke engulfing the area. </p> <p>More than 300 homes have been evacuated so far, and a further 300 were expected to be evacuated by late last night. </p> <p>A total of 16 large fires were raging in the state, covering 135,000 acres. In Nevada, a helicopter carrying a firefighting crew crashed near Elko, killing one member and injuring three others. </p> <p>In Colorado, the Mesa Verde national park was having to deal with a blaze that threatened the park's research centre and museum. More than 400 firefighters were trying to save the threatened parts of the forest, which is a popular holiday place, aided by helicopters and seven air tankers flying in to drop water on the blaze. </p> <p>In California, the US forest service reported that there were more than 100 wildfires blazing and that some were in areas of brush that have not burned in more than 100 years. Two hundred people were evacuated from Jackson, Wyoming, three days ago and have still not been able to return to their homes. </p> <p>Troops are being trained as temporary firefighters. More than 500 soldiers were dispatched from Fort Hood in Texas yesterday after training, to join 500 other soldiers and 500 marines fighting the fires in Idaho. A further 500 were sent to Montana to back up a beleaguered and exhausted fire crew. </p> <p>The head of the US forest service, Mike Dombeck, said yesterday that the situation was now so serious that Canadian firefighting crews were having to be brought in to help. </p> <p>Since the start of this year, there have been about 62,000 wildfires across the US. They have engulfed 3.76m acres of forest, almost double the 10-year average. </p> <p>One of the reasons for this dramatic increase has been that people are going deeper and deeper into forested areas in the search for seclusion. Wherever there are humans, there is the risk of fires - usually started accidentally, from cigarette ends and barbecues, but sometimes lit deliberately. </p> <p>It is now relatively common for people to start fires and then call the fire service and give themselves a heroic role in fighting the blazes. </p> <p>However, while it would make ecological sense to stop people living in such areas, there would be a political price to pay in restricting residential areas. </p> <p>Marines have been using various techniques to try to contain the blazes, ranging from bombing the fires from above with a mixture of slurry and water, to fighting fire with fire - burning swaths of undergrowth themselves to create firebreaks. </p> <p>But unless weather patterns change, they appear to be fighting a losing battle.</p>",

The national interagency fire centre (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho, reported yesterday that there were now more than 70 large fires engulfing more than 750,000 acres in 11 states, notably Montana, California, Colorado, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming. Officials are alarmed that the blazes have come earlier than the usual fire season and that they are proving more difficult to contain. Some of the fires are thought to be so well established that they will only be extinguished by the arrival of snow in October or November. \"The northern Rockies is the hottest place in the country at the moment,\" said Lynn Pisano-Pedigo of the NIFC yesterday. She cited \"dry lightning\" as one of the main causes of the latest outbreak. The weather conditions that produce dry lightning are expected to continue for several weeks - a combination of high temperatures, low humidity and rainless thunderstorms. Temperatures have also been at record highs in many areas. Weather officials report \"triple digit\" temperatures in central California, making the land even more susceptible to the blazes. Hamilton in Montana is at the centre of the main blazes and yesterday residents were warned to remain indoors because of the thick smoke engulfing the area. More than 300 homes have been evacuated so far, and a further 300 were expected to be evacuated by late last night. A total of 16 large fires were raging in the state, covering 135,000 acres. In Nevada, a helicopter carrying a firefighting crew crashed near Elko, killing one member and injuring three others. In Colorado, the Mesa Verde national park was having to deal with a blaze that threatened the park's research centre and museum. More than 400 firefighters were trying to save the threatened parts of the forest, which is a popular holiday place, aided by helicopters and seven air tankers flying in to drop water on the blaze. In California, the US forest service reported that there were more than 100 wildfires blazing and that some were in areas of brush that have not burned in more than 100 years. Two hundred people were evacuated from Jackson, Wyoming, three days ago and have still not been able to return to their homes. Troops are being trained as temporary firefighters. More than 500 soldiers were dispatched from Fort Hood in Texas yesterday after training, to join 500 other soldiers and 500 marines fighting the fires in Idaho. A further 500 were sent to Montana to back up a beleaguered and exhausted fire crew. The head of the US forest service, Mike Dombeck, said yesterday that the situation was now so serious that Canadian firefighting crews were having to be brought in to help. Since the start of this year, there have been about 62,000 wildfires across the US. They have engulfed 3.76m acres of forest, almost double the 10-year average. One of the reasons for this dramatic increase has been that people are going deeper and deeper into forested areas in the search for seclusion. Wherever there are humans, there is the risk of fires - usually started accidentally, from cigarette ends and barbecues, but sometimes lit deliberately. It is now relatively common for people to start fires and then call the fire service and give themselves a heroic role in fighting the blazes. However, while it would make ecological sense to stop people living in such areas, there would be a political price to pay in restricting residential areas. Marines have been using various techniques to try to contain the blazes, ranging from bombing the fires from above with a mixture of slurry and water, to fighting fire with fire - burning swaths of undergrowth themselves to create firebreaks. But unless weather patterns change, they appear to be fighting a losing battle.",

Though he undertook a great variety of roles, all were informed, at heart, with the wisdom of the sad clown.</p> <p>It was that spiritual severity, together with those clear, wide-open eyes - capable of melting in close-up on screen into the most reassuringly serene of smiles - which lent his performances force and authenticity. In his later career, he became something of an icon of spirituality and enlightened human understanding - especially after his 1977 performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars.</p> <p>His contract with George Lucas, guaranteed him two per cent of the profit: though the role had been much reduced, and he had almost left the production. The resulting financial security made this already fastidious actor even choosier about live stage roles. After Star Wars he appeared in only two West End plays, and was an unusual and sensitive Shylock at Chichester (1984).</p> <p>But Guinness was not the first great actor to find the ability and the inclination to learn parts after 70 much reduced. He had avoided the theatre for six years before starring as TE Lawrence in Rattigan's Ross in 1960. More than any other English star of his generation, he was equally at home on stage, in film and on the television screen - where he had an Indian summer as John Le Carr\u00e9's spymaster George Smiley.</p> <p>Guinness had an impecunious childhood, and a modest south-coast boarding school education. At 18 he found employment as a junior copywriter in an advertising agency.</p> <p>He describes in his discreet autobiography Blessings In Disguise (1985) how the acting bug had bitten him. On the recommendation of John Gielgud he contacted the formidable and eccentric Martita Hunt - the first woman he had ever met with silk trousers and painted toenails, he later wrote. She coached him for a RADA Leverhulme scholarship audition. But RADA was not giving the award that year, so he enrolled instead at the Fay Compton studio for as long as his money lasted (John Le Mesurier was a fellow student) and then went to work in the London theatre, debuting aged 20 in Libel! at the Playhouse.</p> <p>In his unpretentious and beautifully written book, he exorcised a long-suppressed anxiety about his origins. He was, he made clear, illegitimate - his name a mystery, his father probably called Geddes, the circumstances of his conception, vague. For the rest, Guinness told the tale of his life obliquely, its focus firmly on loved ones and friends rather than on himself. He was there, as it were, in reflection.</p> <p>Finally the question of his birth didn't matter to him, but in the beginning it must have. A reluctance to put himself in the spotlight - an almost neurotic discretion - was the mark of both his professional and personal style. In a 1953 monograph about him published by Rockliff, Kenneth Tynan wrote: \"Were he to commit a murder, I have no doubt the number of false arrests following the circulation of his description would break all records.\"</p> <p>While still only 20 he was a flowery Osric in Gielgud's Hamlet at the New theatre. Thereafter until the war, his career was spent at Old Vic, where he impressed with a modern-dress Hamlet in autumn 1938.</p> <p>He always denied having any technique as an actor - or knowing what technique might be. Yet he was proud of his gift.</p> <p>For Guinness the purpose of acting was to make-believe. The theatre was an act of faith, whose object was to tell the inner truth about situations and feelings, not to embroider falsehood with trickery and display. He was a master of disguise as he demonstrated in the Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), with an emotionally thankless multiplicity of roles. Denis Price, the villain at the centre, was the sort of charming role that Guinness later made his own, through a series of famous Ealing Studio hits.</p> <p>But the Kind Hearts gallery of family victims was consciously broad brush. Guinness was an actor, not an entertainer or vaudevillian. The spiritual core of Guinness's inner conviction remained the same - whatever game of disguise he might play.</p> <p>His conversion to Roman Catholicism followed an episode during the 1954 shooting of Father Brown (called The Detective in the US), in which he played GK Chesterton's cheery cleric. Walking back in the dark, still in a cassock, to the station hotel of a village near Macon after a drink in the local bar with Peter Finch, his hand was seized by a small boy, a complete stranger, who called him \"Mon p\u00e8re\" and trotted along beside him chatting in French.</p> <p>Despite his phony credentials as a cleric, Guinness felt strongly that the reality of this trust was important. When his 11-year-old son Matthew was temporarily crippled from the waist down with polio, Guinness had taken to dropping in on church and praying. Shortly after Father Brown, he joined the church of Rome.</p> <p>As an actor, he had acute and particular tastes, an infallible instinct for the apt moment, the ideal tone, the canny strategy. When he was Fool to Laurence Olivier's unsuccessful King Lear (1947), Guinness said that Olivier had been irritated that he had received the lion's share of the reviewers' favour. This was, said Guinness, a direct consequence of Larry's actor-managerish vanity. \"Every time Larry came on stage, the lights went up in his vicinity. All I had to do was just stay very close to him.\" Guinness, of course, couldn't fail to be noticed if only because he was doing so little so well.</p> <p>He knew his own vulnerabilities and exploited them with courage, to give some of his best performances. He had resented, for instance, Olivier's assumption in the mid-thirties that he was John Gielgud's boyfriend. Not because he could not have been, or was ashamed or offended to be cast in that role, but because he was not and they had no reason to assume it. In 1938 Guinness became a scrupulous husband and father - though his sexuality was complex.</p> <p>Typically he did not balk at playing the transvestite professional criminal Mrs Artminster in Wise Child (1967) with the then glamorous-looking Simon Ward. His Lawrence in Ross rang dangerously true to self. Being mixed-up, discreet, acutely intelligent and voraciously well-read fuelled the neurotic-but-muffled engine that drove him as an artist.</p> <p>Being so private a personality let him bring out the normally hidden interior aspects of Harcourt Reilly in TS Eliot's Cocktail Party. He played this role, the Unidentified Guest, at Chichester, the Wyndham's and the Haymarket in 1968 and 1969, as well as in Edinburgh and New York in 1950. His reading of Eliot's Four Quartets on radio was spell-binding. He was perfect material for Alan Bennett's Old Country (1977) and Habeas Corpus (1973). In the latter he devised and performed alone a typically self-revealing dance at the end.</p> <p>Tynan's fine portrait of him misinterpreted the diffidence and humility. Guinness, Tynan wrote, \"never will be a star in the sense that Olivier is\u0085He does everything by stealth\u0085He will illumine many a blind alley of subtlety, but blaze no trails\u0085His stage presence is quite without amplitude; and his face, except when, temporarily, make-up transfigures it, is a signless zero.\"</p> <p>The suggestiveness, the wish to avoid being domineering, was a different sort of contract with the audience's imagination. Guinness also wielded glacial fierceness and terror with authority.</p> <p>His greatness materialised without Olivier's showmanship, Richardson's abandoned cussedness, and Gielgud's resonant lyricism. Tynan admired but was inclined to patronise Guinness's poetry and versatility.</p> <p>At 24, in 1951, the critic was engaged by Guinness as Player King in his second Hamlet. Guinness invested much amour propre in this production. Tynan called it \"Hamlet with the pilot dropped\" and said it was cast with \"exuberant oddness\". Its failure turned out to be a major factor in Guinness's move away from the classics and Shakespeare and into films, ultimately television, and new plays.</p> <p>Tynan found Guinness less potent in the classical arena because he expected actors to perform like concerto soloists. I did not see Guinness's inspirational Richard II for Ralph Richardson's Old Vic company at the New theatre (now Albery) in 1947. His Macbeth at the Royal Court (1966) was certainly a quiet, clipped tragic victim without the expected sexiness and physicality, and handicapped by Simone Signoret's characterful, impossibly Gallic English as Lady M. (Gielgud's 1961 Stratford Othello was also criticised for lacking diapason.)</p> <p>In fact, Guinness was an actor for a new theatrical style, subtle and undecorated. From the 1960s in the West End he mostly created roles in new plays rather than challenging memories of Gielgud, Richardson or Olivier. He might have been a marvellous and unusual Lear, but when he took the role on radio it was underwhelming.</p> <p>Though his work in Alan Bennett's plays was superb, he was far less inclined, at the end of his career, to accept the sort of risks that Gielgud - secure in a theatrical dynasty - famously did with Pinter, David Storey and Julian Mitchell.</p> <p>He was always a bit of a social upstart in an English theatre world full of great families, a self-made actor with no advantages, spotted by Gielgud and Guthrie, but dependent on a very spiritual stillness and charisma. When in the mid-seventies I first met Guinness, who had long been an idol, he had a slightly grand shyness off-stage. Yet, of all the great British stage actors, his was the busiest film career, for which his modest way of acting was unrivalled.</p> <p>He was not only an actor. He was good at drawing and produced a charming, diffident design for his own Christmas cards each year. Like Caruso he was a natural at caricatures, especially of himself. He was also a very able author.</p> <p>His adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, directed by Peter Brook in 1946, marked his return to the stage (as Mitya) after war service in the Royal Navy. Earlier, just before the war, his stage version of Great Expectations (later the basis of David Lean's film) had been directed by George Devine.</p> <p>After playing Herbert Pocket in Lean's Great Expectations, and Fagin in Oliver Twist, he went on to a series of glorious Ealing comedies - perhaps most memorably as the crook Henry Holland in Crichton's Lavender Hill Mob, and as Professor Marcus, another crook in Mackendrick's Ladykillers.</p> <p>His greatest film role was probably Colonel Nicholson in Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), where his quintessentially English stiff upper lip and obsessive unreasonableness under, eventually, dreadful Japanese maltreatment won him an Oscar and numerous other prizes.</p> <p>Further award-winning work included the artist Gulley Jimson in The Horse's Mouth, with his own screenplay based on Joyce Carey's novel. It was a pity that his brilliantly unpleasant Scottish impersonation of Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960) was not followed by a lot of other good starring roles with the exception of Dorrit in Christine Edzard's epic Dickens adaptation. He settled mostly for lucrative supporting parts in various blockbusters, including Cromwell, The Comedians and The Quiller Memorandum.</p> <p>Some were quite distinguished - like Lean's Doctor Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia and A Passage to India. In The Fall of the Roman Empire, his Marcus Aurelius was one of the film's few redeeming features. Little Dorrit and his television appearances in Le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and its sequels, were effectively his screen monument.</p> <p>Guinness was a charming, fascinating and elusive companion. He did not enjoy playing the star, though he liked the respect he got when visiting famous restaurants. He lived in a modest way ouside Petersfield from the mid-1950s, with a large garden that much occupied his wife Merula. He had a small circle of particular friends, many outside the theatre. For years he and Merula were close to Rachel Kempson and Michael Redgrave. He was knighted in 1959.</p> <p>If one visited him in his dressing room in the West End in the 1970s one might find a surprisingly broad collection of people there, many of whom were never destined to discover what the others' link with the great actor might be. He preferred to keep his friends separate: a one to one person. He liked good food and drink. His favourite London hotel for years was the Connaught, with its superb cuisine. He was essentially not a club man. Anybody outside his close immediate circle was intrigued by the Guinness enigma.</p> <p>But the reserve through which that attractive generosity and warmth powerfully shone was, for him, an impenetrable and necessary protection.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,351439,00.html\">Sir Alec Guinness dies, aged 86</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,351460,00.html\">'The shy introvert who shone on stage and screen'</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/picturestory/0,6412,351451,00.html\">Picture gallery</a></p>",

When in the mid-seventies I first met Guinness, who had long been an idol, he had a slightly grand shyness off-stage. Yet, of all the great British stage actors, his was the busiest film career, for which his modest way of acting was unrivalled. He was not only an actor. He was good at drawing and produced a charming, diffident design for his own Christmas cards each year. Like Caruso he was a natural at caricatures, especially of himself. He was also a very able author. His adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov, directed by Peter Brook in 1946, marked his return to the stage (as Mitya) after war service in the Royal Navy. Earlier, just before the war, his stage version of Great Expectations (later the basis of David Lean's film) had been directed by George Devine. After playing Herbert Pocket in Lean's Great Expectations, and Fagin in Oliver Twist, he went on to a series of glorious Ealing comedies - perhaps most memorably as the crook Henry Holland in Crichton's Lavender Hill Mob, and as Professor Marcus, another crook in Mackendrick's Ladykillers. His greatest film role was probably Colonel Nicholson in Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), where his quintessentially English stiff upper lip and obsessive unreasonableness under, eventually, dreadful Japanese maltreatment won him an Oscar and numerous other prizes. Further award-winning work included the artist Gulley Jimson in The Horse's Mouth, with his own screenplay based on Joyce Carey's novel. It was a pity that his brilliantly unpleasant Scottish impersonation of Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960) was not followed by a lot of other good starring roles with the exception of Dorrit in Christine Edzard's epic Dickens adaptation. He settled mostly for lucrative supporting parts in various blockbusters, including Cromwell, The Comedians and The Quiller Memorandum. Some were quite distinguished - like Lean's Doctor Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia and A Passage to India. In The Fall of the Roman Empire, his Marcus Aurelius was one of the film's few redeeming features. Little Dorrit and his television appearances in Le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and its sequels, were effectively his screen monument. Guinness was a charming, fascinating and elusive companion. He did not enjoy playing the star, though he liked the respect he got when visiting famous restaurants. He lived in a modest way ouside Petersfield from the mid-1950s, with a large garden that much occupied his wife Merula. He had a small circle of particular friends, many outside the theatre. For years he and Merula were close to Rachel Kempson and Michael Redgrave. He was knighted in 1959. If one visited him in his dressing room in the West End in the 1970s one might find a surprisingly broad collection of people there, many of whom were never destined to discover what the others' link with the great actor might be. He preferred to keep his friends separate: a one to one person. He liked good food and drink. His favourite London hotel for years was the Connaught, with its superb cuisine. He was essentially not a club man. Anybody outside his close immediate circle was intrigued by the Guinness enigma. But the reserve through which that attractive generosity and warmth powerfully shone was, for him, an impenetrable and necessary protection.

The star of films such as the Bridge Over the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, he died on Saturday evening at the King Edward VII Hospital, in Midhurst, West Sussex, after taking ill at his home on Thursday. His death was not announced until early today. A spokesman for the hospital said Sir Alec had died \"very peacefully\". He would not identify the cause of death, but Sir Alec had been in poor health for a number of years. Sir Alec's acting career spanned 60-years and ranged from Shakespearian classics to Ealing comedies, and his acclaimed television portrayal of the spymaster Smiley. In 1959 he won an Oscar for his role as the colonel in the classic Bridge Over the River Kwai, a role which also led to his knighthood the same year. The younger generation will remember him for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in George Lucas' 1977 film Star Wars. Despite the phenomenal success of the film it was a role that the veteran actor despised saying he threw all the fan mail away unopened. The son of a banker, he always wanted to be an actor as a boy and often walked three miles from his home in Bayswater, central London, to the Old Vic to spend his pocket money on watching performances there. He married the playwright Merula Salaman in 1938, and had one son, Matthew. Related articles \u0095 Obituary \u0095 'The shy introvert who shone on stage and screen' \u0095 Picture gallery",

      "body": "<p>It can't possibly have been intentional. The August edition of Nova, which opened with a jokey and seasonal editor's letter - a postcard simply saying Deborah Bee is on holiday - arrived on the same day as the news that Bee's holiday was going to be an exceptionally long one. </p> <p>As is so often the case with new magazines, Bee is leaving the job after producing only a handful of issues. </p> <p>Whether she was as proactive about standing down as her employers IPC would like to make out is of course open to question. The industry rumour suggests that IPC was not happy with the millennial relaunch of the 1960s icon. There's nothing like a bad advertising audit to upset the company applecart, and Nova has seemed a little on the light side in pagination. But the magazine's publisher, Elaine Foran, insists it is \"definitely on budget\" - not just on target, in fact, but better than IPC had hoped in terms of both circulation and advertising. </p> <p>There is also the question of whether Bee was happy to go. She is still answering her phone but unable, she politely regrets, to answer any questions at the moment. </p> <p>Nova has not had an easy ride since it reappeared on May 4. The 1960s incarnation of the magazine is upheld by designers and journalists as a truly provocative, trail-blazing, mould-breaking publication, in which the images and layouts shouted as loudly as the campaigning words. </p> <p>Looking back over those old issues (it stayed the course from 1965 until IPC pulled it in the mid-70s), not many of them measure up to its shining reputation. The ones that do, however, where the directness and sheer courage of an idea is not naive but genuinely confrontational, are remarkable: a cover image of a black man with a single cover line asking if you would really want him to be your neighbour still sends a shiver down the spine. </p> <p>\"The idea of the relaunch stank from the start,\" says Chris Hemblade, acting editor of Time Out and former features editor of Scene, the now-defunct fashion magazine where Bee was editor. \"Every art director uses Nova as a model, an ideal. But this relaunch felt like a bunch of publishing executives wanting to bring back something they'd felt good about in the past. It was bound to be a poor imitation.\" </p> <p>The view from IPC is, as you'd expect, quite different. \"Everything Nova stands for is all the vogue again,\" says Julie York, the company's director of corporate communications. \"That 60s and 70s thing.\" </p> <p>Such literalism seems rather ingenuous from such a giant of publishing. The prevailing \"60s and 70s thing\" emerges from the fact that many current opinion- and taste-makers and media-ites grew up in the 60s and 70s. Their - our - take on the world is certainly informed by values from those decades, but it is liberally reinterpreted for the society we live in today. </p> <p>To be fair to Bee, her original plan wasn't to redo Nova. Bee, then editor of Scene, approached IPC along with Scene's features editor, David Roberts, and its art director, Gerard Saint, with an idea for an intelligent high-fashion magazine aimed at 18- to 25-year-old women. They reckoned there was a gap in the market and that they could produce a niche product to fill it. </p> <p>IPC had long toyed with the idea of a Nova relaunch - it nearly happened 10 years ago, but came out as Marie Claire instead. \"It was something being talked about,\" says Elaine Foran. \"And then Deborah came up with an idea that was so similar that we put the two ideas together.\" </p> <p>Now Jeremy Langmead is waiting to fill Bee's still-warm seat, and hoping to take over early in October. He has been the editor of the Sunday Times Style magazine for the past five years and sees Nova as \"a creative challenge\". </p> <p>Echoing the words of Bee, Roberts et al, he describes his reader as \"intelligent, twenty-something, fashion conscious - Stella McCartney or Chloe Sevigny\". (Let's hope he really means those who aspire to be SM and CS, or he might be terribly disappointed.) He is convinced that there is an elusive gap somewhere between Vogue and Elle. </p> <p>\"I feel confident,\" he enthuses. \"About having a market, knowing it's there. Vogue has got older - it's Lady Helen Windsor and Mario Testino. And Elle's gone much younger - it's the Denise Van Outen of women's magazines. So I'm pitching between the mummies and the dummies.\" </p> <p>Langmead's profile has recently been raised by the publicity surrounding a novel by his ex, India Knight, in which some claimed to see parallels between him and the heroine's husband. </p> <p>Mischievously witty, he is known for his skill and tact in handling contributors, having cultivated AA Gill as Style's restaurant critic and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson as a columnist. The Style section has a formidable record as a launchpad (alumnae include the novelists Helen Fielding and Wendy Holden). The experience of seeing his deputy Liz Jones - now occupying Tara P-T's old slot in Style with her Bridget Jones-style column - chosen as editor of Marie Claire might well have convinced him that it was time to move on. </p> <p>Langmead's suitability, according to Foran, is his experience. \"He can manage a large team and recognise good writing. And he understands how a fashion magazine works.\" </p> <p>He will undoubtedly take people with him, and Nova will inevitably shed a few more original staff. Fashion-pack gossip suggests that Venetia Scott, the fashion director, could walk, taking not just her husband, photographer Juergen Teller, but a whole raft of heavyweight names, including photographers Terry Richardson and David Sims and stylist Nancy Rhode. </p> <p>It's a group of people summed up by one insider as \"having enough clout to work between Vogue and iD, if they choose to\". If they go, a great deal of the title's credibility goes with them. But the idea of credibility hangs heavy here. And that isn't Nova's or anyone else's fault, but the problem in general with general-interest magazines, even those focused on fashion. </p> <p>For all the potential twenty-something readers out there, it's a group that has proven to be notoriously fickle and since it knows how to access information from a variety of places and media - television and the internet are huge providers - is less likely to be loyal to one magazine. </p> <p>When it does come to print, magazines seem to function better the more tightly they are bound to one subject. Outstanding among current successful titles are Mixmag, the dance culture bible, and Wallpaper, the aspirational design bible. Both offer finely honed content to readers according to a specific interest rather than a demographic evaluation. </p> <p>That, along with Nova's difficult heritage, has so far stood in the way of it relaxing into a comfortable role. An ex-employee of Frank, the Wagadon title launched in 1997 that took a stab at a similar market, says: \"It has made an effort to take on the values of old Nova - to be a strong, meaty, social read, dealing with bigger issues. But although we do want to be made aware, pulling it off in this context is very difficult.\" </p> <p>Under pressure to reflect the title's earlier interests, we get Celia Brayfield on why women are still underachieving in the 21st century. With no disrespect to the writer, it made me think I was back in the 70s being lectured by someone's well-meaning mother in a pine-filled kitchen in Camden. </p> <p>Langmead needs to hold on to his fashion team, which is what currently makes this product into the jewel in the crown that IPC wants it to be. He wants to get rid of the magazine's slightly irritable tone, and introduce a softer, more comforting voice. </p> <p>Twenty-something girls might be a prickly, strident bunch these days, but it's dangerous - and unwelcoming - to interpret that too literally. Magazines work by becoming familiar and friendly. </p> <p>There's a reason that the idea of \"curling up\" with them has become a cliche. By his own admission, Langmead wants to \"make it more bubbly, really heat it up\". At least it's already warm. </p> <p> <strong>Re-creation or poor imitation? Twenty-five years on and off</strong> Carolyne Ellis</p> <p> The original Nova was part of its time, it's a different time now, so it's difficult to do the same thing. Nova's strength was that it was irreverent, clever and quite shocking, and visually very strong. There are a lot of magazines these days and to succeed you must be different. <strong> Alexandra Shulman, Vogue</strong> </p> <p>It was a good idea to revive the title, but I don't know how relevant that style of journalism - provocative and groundbreaking then - is now. There's little that shocks today. The magazine was pretty much what we expected - edgy and niche. And if that's what they tried to create, then they've achieved it. <strong> Fiona McIntosh, Elle </strong> </p> <p>I love the [first] cover. It was a nice mix of the 60s and the year 2000. I love the model, I love the fashion - it's nice having a purely fashion magazine again. Some of it does try to please too much. It's a little bit prickly, not apologising about anything. It says, 'this is what we do and if you don't like it, that's tough'. <strong> Liz Jones, Marie Claire </strong> </p> <p>They've got a strong team and the cover and the logo are strong, too. But I felt that it fell between two stools: it was not for the London hipster and it was not mainstream either. I don't think it's a timely or a clever idea. I have been a big fan of the original, but for a first issue it fell short of my expectations. <strong> Johnny Davis, The Face</strong> </p> <p> <strong> From super Nova to not so super Nova </strong></p> <p> * The original Nova ran from 1965 to 1975 and achieved near mythic status. It re-wrote the rules of women's magazines and fashion journalism, becoming the 60s style bible. </p> <p>* Previously women's magazines meant knitting patterns and cooking recipes. Homosexuality and abortion were taboo. Breaking down cultural, moral and sexual prejudices became Nova's aim. One 1967 cover story dealing with homosexual law reform showed two men above the words: \"They consent in private\". A 1969 cover featured child killer Mary Bell. </p> <p>* Editor Dennis Hackett attributed Nova's success to its ability to appeal to both sexes: \"We were read by women and men. We had a 42% male readership - the highest of any women's magazine.\" </p> <p>* Contributors included home editor Janet Fitch, comic strip writer Peter Preston, cookery expert Elizabeth David, writer Penny Vincenzi and astrologer Patrick Walker. </p> <p>* But by the early 70s Nova was losing its editorial and innovatory edge. IPC decided to kill the title in 1975. </p> <p>* On announcing last November that Nova was going to be revived 25 years on, IPC insisted it was not a nostalgia trip - the free, incisive spirit of the original would be preserved but adapted to the concerns of 21st-century women. The mission statement burbled that Nova would set out to be \"fresh\" and \"contemporary\", and provided a profile of \"Nova woman\". Nova woman wore Prada, Gucci, Joseph and French Connection. She liked Kate Moss, Deborah Harry, Blind Date and Ewan MacGregor. She believed in fashion magazines not magazine fashion, sexual equality not feminism, drugs not drug abuse, details not packaging. </p> <p>* According to editor Deborah Bee there was a three-fold prototype: \"The triangle we had as our working model was the style press, which is incredibly cool, the fashion mags, which deal with the catwalk very well, and newspapers, which have the best writing. Our woman is right in the middle of that triangle and wants something from all of those.\" Editors of rival magazines - talking above to the Independent - responded coolly to her debut issue, however. </p> <p>* The Competition: Red (launched: 1998, circ: 180,000); Elle (launched: 1985, circ: 210,000); Marie Claire, (launched: 1988, circ: 450,000).</p>",

Their - our - take on the world is certainly informed by values from those decades, but it is liberally reinterpreted for the society we live in today. To be fair to Bee, her original plan wasn't to redo Nova. Bee, then editor of Scene, approached IPC along with Scene's features editor, David Roberts, and its art director, Gerard Saint, with an idea for an intelligent high-fashion magazine aimed at 18- to 25-year-old women. They reckoned there was a gap in the market and that they could produce a niche product to fill it. IPC had long toyed with the idea of a Nova relaunch - it nearly happened 10 years ago, but came out as Marie Claire instead. \"It was something being talked about,\" says Elaine Foran. \"And then Deborah came up with an idea that was so similar that we put the two ideas together.\" Now Jeremy Langmead is waiting to fill Bee's still-warm seat, and hoping to take over early in October. He has been the editor of the Sunday Times Style magazine for the past five years and sees Nova as \"a creative challenge\". Echoing the words of Bee, Roberts et al, he describes his reader as \"intelligent, twenty-something, fashion conscious - Stella McCartney or Chloe Sevigny\". (Let's hope he really means those who aspire to be SM and CS, or he might be terribly disappointed.) He is convinced that there is an elusive gap somewhere between Vogue and Elle. \"I feel confident,\" he enthuses. \"About having a market, knowing it's there. Vogue has got older - it's Lady Helen Windsor and Mario Testino. And Elle's gone much younger - it's the Denise Van Outen of women's magazines. So I'm pitching between the mummies and the dummies.\" Langmead's profile has recently been raised by the publicity surrounding a novel by his ex, India Knight, in which some claimed to see parallels between him and the heroine's husband. Mischievously witty, he is known for his skill and tact in handling contributors, having cultivated AA Gill as Style's restaurant critic and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson as a columnist. The Style section has a formidable record as a launchpad (alumnae include the novelists Helen Fielding and Wendy Holden). The experience of seeing his deputy Liz Jones - now occupying Tara P-T's old slot in Style with her Bridget Jones-style column - chosen as editor of Marie Claire might well have convinced him that it was time to move on. Langmead's suitability, according to Foran, is his experience. \"He can manage a large team and recognise good writing. And he understands how a fashion magazine works.\" He will undoubtedly take people with him, and Nova will inevitably shed a few more original staff. Fashion-pack gossip suggests that Venetia Scott, the fashion director, could walk, taking not just her husband, photographer Juergen Teller, but a whole raft of heavyweight names, including photographers Terry Richardson and David Sims and stylist Nancy Rhode. It's a group of people summed up by one insider as \"having enough clout to work between Vogue and iD, if they choose to\". If they go, a great deal of the title's credibility goes with them. But the idea of credibility hangs heavy here. And that isn't Nova's or anyone else's fault, but the problem in general with general-interest magazines, even those focused on fashion. For all the potential twenty-something readers out there, it's a group that has proven to be notoriously fickle and since it knows how to access information from a variety of places and media - television and the internet are huge providers - is less likely to be loyal to one magazine. When it does come to print, magazines seem to function better the more tightly they are bound to one subject. Outstanding among current successful titles are Mixmag, the dance culture bible, and Wallpaper, the aspirational design bible. Both offer finely honed content to readers according to a specific interest rather than a demographic evaluation. That, along with Nova's difficult heritage, has so far stood in the way of it relaxing into a comfortable role. An ex-employee of Frank, the Wagadon title launched in 1997 that took a stab at a similar market, says: \"It has made an effort to take on the values of old Nova - to be a strong, meaty, social read, dealing with bigger issues. But although we do want to be made aware, pulling it off in this context is very difficult.\" Under pressure to reflect the title's earlier interests, we get Celia Brayfield on why women are still underachieving in the 21st century. With no disrespect to the writer, it made me think I was back in the 70s being lectured by someone's well-meaning mother in a pine-filled kitchen in Camden. Langmead needs to hold on to his fashion team, which is what currently makes this product into the jewel in the crown that IPC wants it to be. He wants to get rid of the magazine's slightly irritable tone, and introduce a softer, more comforting voice. Twenty-something girls might be a prickly, strident bunch these days, but it's dangerous - and unwelcoming - to interpret that too literally. Magazines work by becoming familiar and friendly. There's a reason that the idea of \"curling up\" with them has become a cliche. By his own admission, Langmead wants to \"make it more bubbly, really heat it up\". At least it's already warm. Re-creation or poor imitation? Twenty-five years on and off Carolyne Ellis The original Nova was part of its time, it's a different time now, so it's difficult to do the same thing. Nova's strength was that it was irreverent, clever and quite shocking, and visually very strong. There are a lot of magazines these days and to succeed you must be different. Alexandra Shulman, Vogue It was a good idea to revive the title, but I don't know how relevant that style of journalism - provocative and groundbreaking then - is now. There's little that shocks today. The magazine was pretty much what we expected - edgy and niche. And if that's what they tried to create, then they've achieved it. Fiona McIntosh, Elle I love the [first] cover. It was a nice mix of the 60s and the year 2000. I love the model, I love the fashion - it's nice having a purely fashion magazine again. Some of it does try to please too much. It's a little bit prickly, not apologising about anything. It says, 'this is what we do and if you don't like it, that's tough'. Liz Jones, Marie Claire They've got a strong team and the cover and the logo are strong, too. But I felt that it fell between two stools: it was not for the London hipster and it was not mainstream either. I don't think it's a timely or a clever idea. I have been a big fan of the original, but for a first issue it fell short of my expectations. Johnny Davis, The Face From super Nova to not so super Nova * The original Nova ran from 1965 to 1975 and achieved near mythic status. It re-wrote the rules of women's magazines and fashion journalism, becoming the 60s style bible. * Previously women's magazines meant knitting patterns and cooking recipes. Homosexuality and abortion were taboo. Breaking down cultural, moral and sexual prejudices became Nova's aim. One 1967 cover story dealing with homosexual law reform showed two men above the words: \"They consent in private\". A 1969 cover featured child killer Mary Bell. * Editor Dennis Hackett attributed Nova's success to its ability to appeal to both sexes: \"We were read by women and men. We had a 42% male readership - the highest of any women's magazine.\" * Contributors included home editor Janet Fitch, comic strip writer Peter Preston, cookery expert Elizabeth David, writer Penny Vincenzi and astrologer Patrick Walker. * But by the early 70s Nova was losing its editorial and innovatory edge. IPC decided to kill the title in 1975. * On announcing last November that Nova was going to be revived 25 years on, IPC insisted it was not a nostalgia trip - the free, incisive spirit of the original would be preserved but adapted to the concerns of 21st-century women. The mission statement burbled that Nova would set out to be \"fresh\" and \"contemporary\", and provided a profile of \"Nova woman\". Nova woman wore Prada, Gucci, Joseph and French Connection. She liked Kate Moss, Deborah Harry, Blind Date and Ewan MacGregor. She believed in fashion magazines not magazine fashion, sexual equality not feminism, drugs not drug abuse, details not packaging. * According to editor Deborah Bee there was a three-fold prototype: \"The triangle we had as our working model was the style press, which is incredibly cool, the fashion mags, which deal with the catwalk very well, and newspapers, which have the best writing. Our woman is right in the middle of that triangle and wants something from all of those.\" Editors of rival magazines - talking above to the Independent - responded coolly to her debut issue, however. * The Competition: Red (launched: 1998, circ: 180,000); Elle (launched: 1985, circ: 210,000); Marie Claire, (launched: 1988, circ: 450,000).",

How strange to see the name attached to something which is so clearly an imitation, if not actually a forgery. Citro\u00ebn have gone to the well-established Renault Scenic for the Picasso's look and layout and haven't really forced the idea for ward, beyond adding a few bits of plastic and a couple of eccentric gimmicks, and then giving the whole thing a re-spray in a variety of eye-tingling colours. </p> <p>The Renault Scenic was the mini MPV and a smart compromise: a people carrier for people who realised that they needed to drive children and large amounts of junk around but still wanted a vehicle on which the back end came round the corner at roughly the same time as the front end.

That said, even with a fully automatic push-button system in place, a hint of Vichy France remains in the way the Picasso's cloth roof concertinas its way to the back of the car. Why does one feel this mechanism isn't built to last? You can feel that about the car generally. I introduced a one-year-old into the rear of the Picasso, closed the door on him and waited. In less than 30 seconds he had located, pulled down and snapped clean off the aeroplane-style seatback tray in front of him. </p> <p>But never mind the quality, feel the space. Space is, after all, what the market seems to be screaming for. The Picasso has a cavernous boot. You could stage an exhibition in there. And the handbrake is hard up against the driver's seat and the gear-shift is mounted in the dashboard rather than on the floor - a throw-back to the old and admirably cranky Citro\u00ebns of the past, but also a policy decision, designed to free up space between the front seats and enable you to get into the back of the car without going out of the door first. </p> <p>This makes good sense in any number of imaginable child-related scenarios but I don't suppose anyone who is over four foot six could manage it comfortably. Also, it's worth remembering: if you can get to them in the back, they can get to you in the front. Particularly if they aren't over four foot six. Generally the Picasso ditches the unfussiness of the Scenic for something more frothy and - dare I use the word - \"fun\". Note the eye-shaped headlights, the grinning grille, the badge where the nose might be - no other car on the market resembles a Pok\u00e9mon so closely. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the instrument panel - an ovoid recess in the acreage of plastic between you and the bottom of the windscreen - owes very little to Cubism and quite a lot to the deck of the Starship Enterprise.

Accordingly, stowed neatly in the Picasso's boot (and not as an extra, note, but as a standard), is what Citro\u00ebn refers to bravely as \"the Modubox\" - your very own, detachable, fold-away shopping basket on wheels.

Three major productions of Meyer's translations are currently in preparation: Creditors and Pariah, as a double bill at the Southwark Playhouse, Shared Experience's A Doll's House, also in London, and Ghosts, at the Royal Exchange, Manchester - 34 years after the translations were made.</p> <p>British theatre in the 1950s was far more parochial than now. There was no National Theatre, and the Royal Shakespeare Company was confined to Stratford and the Shakespearean repertoire. In 1959, as a schoolboy crazed with theatre, I went to the Lyric, Hammersmith, to see my first Ibsen. Michael Elliott directed Brand for Casper Wrede's 59 Theatre Company, with Patrick McGoohan in the lead.</p> <p>The production, design and acting rightly received great praise, but the fact of the matter is that Brand had only previously been known through William Archer's six-hour long rhyming couplet version. It was unstageable. Meyer's superb blank verse version rescued the play from oblivion. Indeed, it placed Ibsen back where he belongs, at the centre of the repertoire. By so doing, it influenced the thinking of writers and directors in a profound way, which has not been fully appreciated.</p> <p>Meyer's witty, moving and acute autobiography is called, typically, Not Prince Hamlet (1985). Michael thought of himself as a bystander, an extra, privileged to know famous men better than he, but always to be ranked lower than them.</p> <p>This is wrong on two main counts. First, this was the man who wrote The End Of The Corridor, a novel based on his unhappy days at Wellington College, pub-lished in 1951; that year he also wrote his first play, The Ortolan, produced by Wrede in 1953, with Maggie Smith in the lead, and by myself in 1965, with Helen Mirren. It was the same man who later wrote Lunatic And Lover, a play about Strindberg's love life, Summer In Gossensass, about Ibsen's late love, and Meeting In Rome, which starred Kenneth Haigh, an account of a fictional meeting between the two giants; and, in 1992, adapted Gissing's The Odd Women, which I directed for the Royal Exchange.</p> <p>Secondly - and more importantly - Meyer wrote the definitive biographies of Ibsen (three volumes, 1967-71) and Strindberg (1985). The first won the Whitbread Biography Prize in 1971, and the other led to his becoming the first Englishman to be awarded the Gold Medal by the Swedish Academy. They are model biographies, and stand in their own right as works of literature.</p> <p>All this is legacy enough. But for those who knew him, Meyer the man was as great an achievement as Meyer the artist. Born in London, into the timber-importing family which ran the firm of Montague Meyer, he read English at Christ Church, Oxford. While there, he edited Eight Oxford Poets (1941) with Sidney Keyes; following Keyes's death, Meyer edited Keyes's Collected Poems (1945, revised 1989). Meyer's studies were interrupted by war service, at Bomber Command from 1942-45, and, after taking his degree, he lectured at Uppsala University from 1947-50, where he learnt Swedish and Norwegian. Between 1978 and 1991, he was visiting professor of drama at various US universities.</p> <p>His gargantuan appetite for life was as passionate as his love of the theatre. He was a keen sportsman, excelling in hockey and real tennis, and no bad hand with bat and ball. He was a fanatical watcher of sport, with an awesome recall of match detail: he once drew the entire English football team around him after the England-Scotland match in Euro 1996, not because he was trying to, but because they were captivated by him. His greatest passion of all, perhaps, was for food. He was a close friend of Sir Raymond Postgate, founder of The Good Food Guide, served on the committee and nearly took over the editorship.</p> <p>Meyer will be missed for his warmth and generosity, both private and public. He devised three anthologies: Rogues And Vagabonds, about theatre, His And Hers, about sex and love, and Fun And Games, about sports, which he would cast with famous actors and take all over the country to raise money for charity. If he believed in someone, he would encourage them, make introductions and, not least (as I remember from my youth) sometimes feed them.</p> <p>Indeed, the Royal Exchange Theatre, previously the 69 Theatre Company, owes him a huge debt. Meyer it was who introduced me to Michael Elliott and Casper Wrede, whom I had admired as a schoolboy watching that memorable 59 Theatre Company. I had written to Michael asking to use his translation of Brand, which, God help me, I wanted to play at school. He came to all my university productions, and persuaded these two distinguished men to take notice of me. The result is the Royal Exchange, which he regarded as his home. We will always see him as one of the moving lights of the company.</p> <p>Almost every theatre company in this country, and many in the US, have staged important productions of Meyer's translations. He never seemed to believe in the immensity of his contribution, and probably never realised how much he was loved by so many people. With his daughter, Nora, he had a relationship all fathers and children would envy, and he also leaves his brother, Peter. I expect that up in heaven now, Ibsen and Strindberg will be saying \"thank you\", the chefs will be quaking, and it will certainly be a more fun place to be.</p> <p>Michael Leverson Meyer, translator and biographer, born June 11 1921; died August 3 2000</p>",

Sources very close to the ex-editor of this paper couldn't be happier about that. Recondite stuff? Not at all. Here is a horror story. </p> <p>You surely remember some of it: the randy president of the United States, the plump young intern, sex in the Oval Office, the mystery of the semen-stained dress. You probably won't, though, have been following what happened much later - including the trial of one of Judge Kenneth Starr's permutating spokesmen, Charles Bakaly, for lying to a judge. (Was he or wasn't he the source of a New York Times story? Verdict awaited). </p> <p>The two stories are linked, of course: both feature America's one-man unofficial press complaints commission, Steven Brill, editor of the modestly titled magazine he calls Brill's Content. Brill began snapping away at the Monica Lewinsky saga two years ago in a memorably long and contentious article called Pressgate. And this watchdog is still gnawing the same, battered bone. </p> <p>Brill's thesis is simple and damning. There seemed to be many sources through the White House travails of 1998 and 1999 as newspaper reporters and TV political commentators and magazine investigators and internet gossipers and talk show hosts chased each others' tales through the thickets of scandal. It was such a huge thing; it was so infinitely exciting that the world media looked on agog. Yet, when you comb through the first six months of these pulsations, there were really only three people making the news. </p> <p>One was Linda Tripp, the \"friend\" of Monica who wanted to write a book and be famous. Another was Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent and renowned Clinton loather, who wanted to sell that book for cash. And the third, more collective source, was the office of the \"independent prosecutor\", Ken Starr, which had spent millions in fruitless pursuit of the president and needed a break, any break, like desert rats need an ice-cold lager. Put that trio together and you've more or less run out of other sources - save for a little toing and froing with the lawyers for Paula Jones, who had their own fish to fry. </p> <p>Consider, then, a few of the more memorable Monica moments. How (around mid-October 1997) did it all start? When the Jones legal team began getting anonymous telephone calls from a woman who told them that Tripp and Lewinsky would be worth subpoenas. Who made those calls? Tripp herself. Did Lucianne encourage Linda? \"Not exactly, but, hell, I guess you could say so.\" The subpoenas were issued. Thereafter, one of the pair called the Starr team to alert them to Lewinsky's existence - and once that had happened, the story (in news reporting terms) became \"real\". Newsweek began to be interested. The show was on the road. </p> <p>What about all the love letters and tapes that Lewinsky allegedly had sent by courier to Clinton's office after the affair was over, times and deliveries documented and leaked? Lucianne's brother's family owns the courier firm. Tripp and Goldberg (un-amazingly enough) told Monica which company to use. </p> <p>That stained blue dress, may be (nudge, nudge) uncleaned and still in existence: \"Monica's Love Dress\", according to the New York Daily News. Matt Drudge, internet gossip, breaks the tale on the net. There's a \"potential DNA trail\" and ABC television is soon following it. Is this Tripp stirring the Drudge sludge? No: Goldberg is the source again - though, she tells Brill, she's not sure that Monica told Linda she'd \"saved\" it, just that it was stained. \"I might have added the part about it being saved.\" It does not stop the story echoing round the globe. (We only learn much later that the dress had been dry-cleaned anyway.) </p> <p>And then... the White House employee (perhaps a butler, perhaps a secret service agent) who supposedly \"walked in\" on the guilty couple. Enter a Washington lawyer, Joseph DiGenova, and his lawyer wife, Victoria. Joe hears Vicki on the phone talking to an old White House chum (unspecified) who says that he/or she's talked to another co-worker who saw Bill and Monica \"in a compromising position\". The co-worker has asked the chum to ask Victoria whether she might do the legal honours if he/she goes to Kenneth Starr (though, unbeknown to Joe, nobody pursues anything). </p> <p>DiGenova mentions this to a reporter from the Dallas Morning News, which gets out the big headline type. A one-source story, Brill remarks, from a fifth-hand source - because \"DiGenova (1) heard his wife (2) talking to a friend (3) of someone (4) who had talked to someone (5) who said they'd seen Lewinsky with Clinton.\" By the time the Associated Press had picked it up from Dallas and CNN was running with it, fifth-hand was seventh-hand. </p> <p>I could go on (and Brill does, with a beady eye for detail): but the essential case is already made. The president and the intern were horrendously foolish - and Bill Clinton's reputation, unlike Monica's dress, is stained for ever. There was a story in there somewhere. But, crucial caveat, most of the stories around the story were the confections of three eager people (Linda, Lucianne and Ken) with axes to grind. </p> <p>Back to modern times, Charles Bakaly and the charges of lying. As the impeachment proceedings reached fever pitch in January 1999, the New York Times reported \"several associates\" of Judge Starr as saying that the independent counsel's office had concluded that Mr Clinton could be indicted while a sitting president. Was Bakaly one - or all - of those associates? He denied it; then, in evidence, admitted handing over an indictment memo to the Times. </p> <p>Well, we'll see. . . but we don't, I think, need to wait for a conclusion. The Lewinsky affair, in its lathering falsities, was the shaming of modern journalism. So few sources, so much blather. And because news is constant now - from a word on the net or the agency wires to speculation as fact to a balloon of talk show discussion - the machine feeds the frenzy. What everybody's saying becomes obviously true - because everybody's saying it. Even if the first and only person to say it was Lucianne of the stained/saved dress. </p> <p>The press, says Alastair Campbell bitterly, just make up stories. No they don't: but they do find it increasingly hard to know what's real and what's phoney in the constant reprocessing from sheet to sheet and medium to medium - what's source for the goose and sauce for a gander. May Heaven bless Mr Rusbridger and his prospective code. May the reader be better informed. The miasma of Monica, though, had too little to do with the reader.

The former labourer, 39, might be low on name recognition, but that of his victim is known even to those who have no knowledge of her abruptly curtailed life. Megan Kanka was seven years old when Timmendequas, a New Jersey neighbour living with two other paedophiles, abducted, raped and strangled her in 1994. The girl's parents believed that she might still be alive had they known he was living nearby and set about gathering 430,000 signatures to press for a change in the law. New Jersey responded quickly, and in 1996 Congress and President Bill Clinton obliged with the measure known as Megan's law: each state had to release \"relevant\" information about child molesters and violent sexual offenders to the public. It was left to each of the 50 states to decide how access to the information was provided. Civil libertarians argue that the law breaches the privacy of ex-offenders and makes them a target for retribution. \"People who have been convicted of crimes, who have served their sentences, should not be the subject of continuing punishment,\" said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

Then a school counsellor who had never been accused of sex crimes was identified as an offender in handbills distributed close to his home. Many people were upset when it became clear that they would not find out about every sex offender but only those who were living nearest to them and were considered the most dangerous. Later, five bullets were fired through the sitting room window of a home above that of a man who had been to prison for raping teenagers. Elsewhere, a man hanged himself from a tree in Santa Rosa, California, after police warned his neighbours that he was a convicted child molester; another shot himself after officers in Seal Cove, Maine, distributed handbills saying he had confessed to having sex with a boy six years previously; an offender's car was fire-bombed in Los Angeles after he appeared on an internet list; and two men beat a convicted sex offender with a baseball bat in North Fort Myers, Florida, and threatened to kill him if he went near children in the neighbourhood.

Seen from this perspective, the appeal of programmes such as Big Brother - in which contestants are cooped up in a house and battle against each in the hope that they will be the last to be turfed out by a TV audience - is the modern version of the Colosseum and illustrative of the same sort of moral decay that led to Rome's demise. </p> <p>But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that this is not the case, or even if it is that the forces of globalisation will result in the rejuvenation of western culture rather than a creeping homogeneity. Are there any factors that will limit the rise of the cultural industries? </p> <p>Two immediately spring to mind. One is the British cult of amateurism, normally dressed up as spontaneity or creativity. Our ideal hero is the chap who is persuaded to step in at the last minute for a cricket match on the village green, borrows a pair of flannels and a bat held together with sticky tape, then goes in and scores a brilliant century. But real life is not like that. </p> <p>It is no accident that the United States has been the dominant force in world cinema for the past century, because whereas Hollywood has always been consumer rather than producer driven, Europe's filmmakers have never had much truck with market reseach. </p> <p>As Finola Kerrigan and Nigel Culkin of the Univesity of Hertfordshire concluded in a study of cinema: \"Historically, the structural problems which are seen to dog the European industry emanate from the organisation of the industry itself combined with a reluctance on the part of the Europeans to adopt industrial and marketing tactics readily embraced by Hollywood. </p> <p>\"The European industries are very heavily production led and continue to ignore the importance of distribution, which results in their failure to secure a greater share of the global film market.\" </p> <p>So, if we want our cultural industries to thrive, lesson one is to treat them as an industry, with proper regard given to those elements - investment, research and development - that make firms successful in competitive markets. </p> <p>Make do and mend - a philosophy tested to destruction in parts of manufacturing - will not do if we are to alter a situation in which British films capture 1% of the American market and US films take 70% of the British market. </p> <p>The average budget for American productions in Britain is \u00a318m, against \u00a33m for British films. Alan Parker, who is chairing the film council, set up by the Department of Culture Media and Sport, wants Britain to concentrate on making fewer vanity films and more blockbusters. </p> <p>Some might not like this approach, arguing that Hollywood is about the lowest common denominator, dumbing down and formula movie-making. Given that America has given us Scorsese, Coppola and Altman, while we have given them the Carry On series and Hammer Horror, this is not an especially strong case. Parker's approach is the right one, and applies to TV as well as film, where the demand for programmes triggered by the satellite and cable revolution has outstripped the ability of programme makers to supply quality products. Greg Dyke's plans for two new BBC TV channels are fine in principle, but will only succeed if the money is there to make quality programmes. </p> <p>Lesson number two is that there should be less emphasis on high culture and more on mass culture. This is brought home in an excellent pamphlet by James Heartfield in which he argues that leisure has been captured by the rich.

Well, not if we see culture as the icing on the cake, the bit of the economy that celebrates the human spirit and adds texture to life. But it does if we think that we can make a living out of cultural industries, because the market for mass culture in Britain is far bigger than that for minority culture. </p> <p>Unfortunately, culture is one of the bulwarks of British snobbery; high culture is seen as quality culture, pop culture as low-grade culture.

Unfortunately, culture is one of the bulwarks of British snobbery; high culture is seen as quality culture, pop culture as low-grade culture. A glance at some of the \"high culture\" on display at Tate Modern is a quick-working antidote for this way of thinking. In the end, the choice is between being a niche player or going for a mass market. The glamorous end of the fashion industry is designing haute couture for Paris and Milan; the real money is made in the high street. Britain's economic history is full of missed opportunities. It would be a shame to see the cultural industries go the same way.

The decision, one of the first and most controversial facing the new president, is expected to feature heavily in the November elections.</p> <p>Washington's plans to erect a satellite-controlled defence shield designed to protect the US against long-range missiles launched by \"rogue\" states such as North Korea and Iran have been condemned in Russia and some parts of Europe, amid fears that they could reignite the arms race in Asia. Officials in Beijing have already warned that China would end cooperation on arms control measures and anti-proliferation efforts if the anti-missile shield were to be erected.</p> <p>The defence system itself has also come under fire, after tests last month failed to shoot down dummy warheads over the Pacific. An official report on the failure, expected to be released on Thursday, largely blames a malfunctioning 10-year-old circuit board for preventing the release of the missile from the rocket launcher and ruining a $100m test, according to yesterday's Washington Post.</p> <p>The Pentagon is understood to want to keep its options open as the country prepares for a new president. Its officials have argued that in order to have the anti-missile system in place by 2005 - when North Korea is expected to have built its own long-range missiles - construction of the proposed radar station would have to begin next summer. Construction contracts would then need to be awarded this winter to start work on the radar station to be built on a remote island in Alaska.</p> <p>This initial phase of construction would pay for materials which could then be used for other defence projects if the next president decides to veto the system.</p> <p>\"Much of the stuff you're going to buy is stuff the Army Corps of Engineers could use somewhere else anyway,\" an official told the Post.</p> <p>However, the go-ahead would represent a highly symbolic move for such a controversial project.</p> <p>The government's lawyers have warned that the system would contravene the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.</p> <p>Mr Cohen could still make a different recommendation to the president, although he is unlikely to reject advice from senior staff members.</p> <p>A spokesman for the defence department said the reports about Mr Cohen's recommendation were premature.</p> <p>Mr Clinton is also expected to weigh up a \"national intelligence estimate\" on how other countries would respond to the US decision, as well as the current state of the threat from North Korea, which has moved closer to South Korea, its pro-western neighbour, in recent months.</p> <p>George W Bush, the Republican party's presidential nominee, has already expressed a preference for \"a more robust\" national security system, without providing too many details of these plans.</p>",

Washington's plans to erect a satellite-controlled defence shield designed to protect the US against long-range missiles launched by \"rogue\" states such as North Korea and Iran have been condemned in Russia and some parts of Europe, amid fears that they could reignite the arms race in Asia. Officials in Beijing have already warned that China would end cooperation on arms control measures and anti-proliferation efforts if the anti-missile shield were to be erected. The defence system itself has also come under fire, after tests last month failed to shoot down dummy warheads over the Pacific. An official report on the failure, expected to be released on Thursday, largely blames a malfunctioning 10-year-old circuit board for preventing the release of the missile from the rocket launcher and ruining a $100m test, according to yesterday's Washington Post. The Pentagon is understood to want to keep its options open as the country prepares for a new president. Its officials have argued that in order to have the anti-missile system in place by 2005 - when North Korea is expected to have built its own long-range missiles - construction of the proposed radar station would have to begin next summer. Construction contracts would then need to be awarded this winter to start work on the radar station to be built on a remote island in Alaska. This initial phase of construction would pay for materials which could then be used for other defence projects if the next president decides to veto the system. \"Much of the stuff you're going to buy is stuff the Army Corps of Engineers could use somewhere else anyway,\" an official told the Post. However, the go-ahead would represent a highly symbolic move for such a controversial project. The government's lawyers have warned that the system would contravene the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Mr Cohen could still make a different recommendation to the president, although he is unlikely to reject advice from senior staff members. A spokesman for the defence department said the reports about Mr Cohen's recommendation were premature. Mr Clinton is also expected to weigh up a \"national intelligence estimate\" on how other countries would respond to the US decision, as well as the current state of the threat from North Korea, which has moved closer to South Korea, its pro-western neighbour, in recent months. George W Bush, the Republican party's presidential nominee, has already expressed a preference for \"a more robust\" national security system, without providing too many details of these plans.",

Agony aunts always counsel that sex is much better if you care about someone and, whether or not this is true in life, it certainly applies to drama.

But as he approaches the end of a second term, it seems increasingly clear that his major achievement has been to liberate public discussion of oral sex. In the confidence with which it reports the court evidence (and with which it screens or reconstructs those crucial Polaroids) this is very much a post-Monica documentary. </p> <p>As Charles Bruce's film shows, the judge hearing the case in 1963 could bring himself to refer to fellatio only as \"sexual association\". The documentary is best in such details of historical speech and behaviour. Whereas most previous accounts have depicted the Duchess of Argyll as a victim of sexual experimentation, this film emphasises the extent to which her downfall resulted from a desire to experience new technology. Polaroid cameras became a status item for the rich in the 1950s. And where many affairs had been exposed by the cameras of private detectives, the Duchess was trapped by her own snaps. </p> <p>The most frequent irritations in television documentaries these days are overly clever music cues and jokey voice-overs. The Duchess And The Headless Man escapes the first charge through the luck that its subject featured in Cole Porter's You're The Top (as \"Mrs Sweeney\", a previous married name). But a mock-Movietone commentary - in fusty, fussy aristocratic tones - not only chafes but roots the material in the past when it has many intriguing parallels with more modern controversies. </p> <p>The documentary's climax is the first naming of the headless man.

      "bodyText": "The fishermen of Great Yarmouth are used to heading out into the North Sea to try to net whiting and herring, but yesterday their catch came to them instead. A silver shower of baby fish rained down on terrace houses behind the resort's seafront, lining lawns and pathways with bite-size sprats. The shower of fish - dead but still fresh - astonished residents in the Norfolk town, where a thunderstorm preceded the slap of falling seafood on gardens and roofs. \"I thought at first I might have had something wrong with my eyes,\" said a retired ambulance driver, Fred Hodgkins, 65, whose house took the best of the unexpected catch. \"The whole of my backyard seemed to be covered in little slivers of silver. When I looked again, I realised they were scores of tiny silver fish.\" The two inch-long sprats covered a garden shed and several lawns in the area, giving local cats a memorable Sunday. Andy Yeatman of the Met Office said waterspouts, small tornadoes over the sea or lakes that suck up water and anything on or in it, regularly deposited everything from toads to periwinkles on surprised communities. \"It has rained fish, frogs and even inanimate objects like straw and plants,\" he said. \"Mini-tornadoes build up under thunderclouds. In this case the tornado gathered over the sea and the fish got sucked up into the clouds. They were obviously carried along in the cloud for some distance before the cloud burst and the fish fell away with the rain.\"",

      "bodyText": "The isolation of the countryside could be worsened by the privatised rail companies' plans to strip many stations of the right to sell cheaper tickets, campaigners warned yesterday. It is feared hundreds of smaller, mainly rural, stations will be excluded from the introduction of new machines issuing advance tickets. Pre-booked tickets, such as Apex bargain fares, would have to be bought over the telephone or internet, or by travelling to a larger station. Every station will still sell tickets for the day of travel, but these can cost six or seven times more than advance fares. The plans have been drawn up by the Association of Train Operating Companies, representing 25 operators, which claims that some stations sell as few as 10 advance tickets a year. About 1,000 of Britain's 2,500 stations presently lack facilities to issue advance tickets and this figure will probably increase when the new ticket machinery is installed next year, the rail companies said. The companies would not say how many stations will be affected, but it is reported their plans could affect as many as two-thirds of stations. Anthony Smith, of the rail passengers' council, said the proposals were a backward step at a time when rail travel was supposed to be booming. \"It seems extraordinary in this day and age that they want to send people away who are trying to give them money. What other retailer would do this? The rail regulator, Tom Winsor, stated that any such proposal required his approval: \"The train operators have made no application to me for any such approval.

If John Prescott really means business about getting people out of their cars, he has to make comprehensive through-ticketing a condition in the next round of rail franchises.\" While admitting it will save them money, the train companies insisted the aim was to provide a clearer, standard system for tickets, as privatisation had left different arrangements at individual stations.

Mrs Davies was told that her farm had been expropriated without compensation. The government took the land immediately and gave the elderly widow 90 days to get out of her house.</p> <p>It was the first legal confiscation by Robert Mugabe under his considerable powers to take any land he chooses for redistribution to poor blacks. If Mrs Davies's farm had also been the last to be seized, or was one of just a couple of hundred farms, it probably would not make much difference to greater Zimbabwe. But if Mugabe now does what he says he is going to do, then his country is in for a rough time.</p> <p>Things looked bad enough when the government said that it intended to take 804 farms, but that at least left most of the commercial land still dedicated to producing vital tobacco exports. But now Mugabe has raised the bleak prospect of expropriating more than 3,000 farms - two-thirds of the white-owned agricultural land - and he says even that may not be enough.</p> <p>It is not certain that Mugabe intends to follow through on his pledge, but don't count on him backing down. Many Zimbabweans thought the land issue would quietly die after it was used to whip up anti-white sentiment, and support for Mugabe \"the liberation war hero\", ahead of June's parliamentary elections. But Zanu-PF's humiliating near-defeat has helped keep land top of the agenda.</p> <p>After the shock of the parliamentary ballot, there is no shortage of voices telling Mugabe that he cannot win the next presidential election in two years' time. Some of the doubters inside his party say that he knows it. But if Mugabe is on the way out, he has little incentive to drop his assault on the farms. And if he hopes to win another election, then it is a powerful issue to keep alive.</p> <p>Mugabe's constituency, those for whom he believes he governs, and for whom he fought a liberation war, are not the city dwellers who snubbed him so defiantly in June's parliamentary elections. Such support as he has is among the peasants and landless rural poor, whose lives have not improved measurably for all Zimbabwe's past economic successes. Now there are hundreds of thousands of blacks who expect to be given land, much of it good land. Why not one last gesture for the people who matter to him? And at the same time, exact revenge on the whites he so despises? For Mugabe, it is the opportunity to go down in history as the man who not only liberated Zimbabwe from the colonists, but finally righted a great historical wrong and delivered the land back to its proper owners.</p> <p>None of this may come to pass, but all efforts to prevent it so far have backfired. What began as the prospect of seizing a few hundred farms has increased to several thousand as Mugabe was denounced by Zimbabweans and foreigners as a tyrant out of step with a changing world. There is not much to be achieved by hurling insults at Mugabe. Peter Hain and Robin Cook tried it and did little more than harden the president's determination to snatch the land. In any case, to African ears, the tone of British official criticism still smacks of neo-colonialism.</p> <p>Mugabe's bitterness encompasses more than the whites camped on Zimbabwean soil. He is not alone among African leaders in being disgruntled at being forced to swallow the new ideology of globalisation and other western medicines that have prevented many governments of poor countries having any real say in the fate of their nations. Few have much to show for it.</p> <p>Thabo Mbeki's scepticism over the link between HIV and Aids is more than mere contrariness. He is deeply suspicious about western intentions on his continent. To the rest of the world, the 2006 World Cup debacle might have been farce, but in Africa it was understood as a racist conspiracy. Where Mbeki is not at one with Mugabe is over the economic cost of the land seizures. Mugabe famously tells those dignitaries who tramp to his door in the belief they can change his thinking what they want to hear, and then he carries on as usual. This is what happened when Mbeki turned up in Harare with a few heavyweight cabinet ministers in tow.</p> <p>They have good reason to be worried about what is happening in Zimbabwe. An economic meltdown has many implications for South Africa, not least because of the danger of large numbers of Zimbabweans heading south to search for work, and the damage the crisis does to foreign confidence in the region.</p> <p>At a press conference, Mbeki spoke of the need to establish the rule of law - which is code for ending the hundreds of illegal farm occupations by the war veterans. Under pressure to respond, Mugabe said he would get veterans off those farms not legally designated for seizure. Even the state-run Herald newspaper hailed it as a breakthrough. The South Africans seemed pleased.</p> <p>But Mugabe didn't mean it. Next day, he was denouncing his own newspaper for misinterpreting him, and promising to take every piece of white-owned farmland in the country if he felt like it. And he does feel like it. Mugabe has heard all the arguments, economic, legal, moral, against snatching farms but none is as persuasive to him as the case for redistribution.</p> <p>The moral question, the one for full compensation to the farmers, is the weakest. Theoretically they will get the cost of their homes and farm buildings. In any case, even those Zimbabweans who don't agree with what is going on speak with some bitterness about the manner in which the land was stolen at gunpoint and with considerable brutality little more than a century ago - not long when you see Ian Smith's old friend, the Queen Mother, getting her birthday card. That is no excuse for vilifying white farmers as Idi Amin hounded the Asians, or treating them with cruelty and brutality. Mugabe might want all the whites out of the country, but that is not the wish of most Zimbabweans.</p> <p>Then there is the legal case, but the west is hardly in a position to lecture Mugabe on the rule of law after decades of riding roughshod over the human rights of Africa by arming governments that commit genocide and propping up authoritarian leaders who plunder their treasuries. The only truly persuasive argument against the redistribution of the farms is the devastating impact the wreckage of the economy will have on the welfare of most Zimbabweans. The commercial farms bring in most of the country's hard currency and are the single largest employer.</p> <p>Mugabe and his government cannot fail to understand the consequence of redistribution of the country's most productive land to subsistence level farmers. At best, Zimbabwe will be able to feed itself. But the tobacco industry has already said that it will shut down if 3,000 farms are seized. Then there will be little hard currency to pay for fuel and electricity, and so little incentive for industry to stay around.</p> <p>A good proportion of the working population - farm hands to factory workers - will be out of jobs. If that happens, Zimbabwe will need all the subsistence farmers it can get.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com\">chris.mcgreal@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Lobbying by the BBC has helped convince the government to resist pressure to abolish its governors, although their powers will be curtailed under proposals to be published later this year. </p> <p>Ministers are concerned that the governors are too closely associated with the BBC's managers, and not sufficiently independent to represent the viewers. They are likely to be placed under the control of an independent regulator which will oversee the entire broadcasting industry. </p> <p>Some of the BBC's commercial rivals had called for the governors to be abolished and for the BBC to be placed under the same form of independent regulation. The Commons culture, media and sport select committee remarked in a report last week that \"the views and roles of management and of the governors appear indistinguishable\". </p> <p>Ministers seem to have accepted the corporation's argument that, given its unique status as a semi-private organisation funded by public money, it should have its own layer of regulation. The government is understood to recognise the role they play in monitoring how licence-fee payers' money is spent at the corporation. </p> <p>Recently, the governors have made conspicuous attempts to assert their independence.

      "bodyText": "Lobbying by the BBC has helped convince the government to resist pressure to abolish its governors, although their powers will be curtailed under proposals to be published later this year. Ministers are concerned that the governors are too closely associated with the BBC's managers, and not sufficiently independent to represent the viewers. They are likely to be placed under the control of an independent regulator which will oversee the entire broadcasting industry. Some of the BBC's commercial rivals had called for the governors to be abolished and for the BBC to be placed under the same form of independent regulation. The Commons culture, media and sport select committee remarked in a report last week that \"the views and roles of management and of the governors appear indistinguishable\". Ministers seem to have accepted the corporation's argument that, given its unique status as a semi-private organisation funded by public money, it should have its own layer of regulation. The government is understood to recognise the role they play in monitoring how licence-fee payers' money is spent at the corporation. Recently, the governors have made conspicuous attempts to assert their independence. They were critical of BBC1 in their annual report earlier this year, and are seeking reassurances on aspects of the BBC's plans to reorganise its television channels. The plan, being developed by the director general Greg Dyke and his director of television, Mark Thompson, envisages focusing BBC1 more on entertainment, more serious programmes on BBC2, and turning the digital channels BBC Choice and Knowledge into BBC3 and 4, respectively a youth network and a cultural channel. Governors want to be sure that factual and news programmes will still feature prominently on BBC1. No final decision on the governors' future status has been taken - the consultation process for the communications white paper, due to be published in the autumn, ended in June, and the responses are being considered by ministers at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry. Almost the entire broadcasting industry, in submissions to the consultation process, agreed that some form of single regulatory system should replace the plethora of regulators and watchdogs, such as the Independent Television Commission, the Radio Authority, and the Broadcasting Standards Commission. The BBC, however, in its submission said that its obligations to serve the public interest and remain independent of commercial and political pressures must be safeguarded. \"It is difficult to see how they could be combined within the oversight of a single regulatory body without compromising those characteristics which ensure that the BBC serves the public interest in a unique way,\" it said. Under the new system, it is likely that the governors will remain the first port of call for complaints against the BBC by viewers, and will maintain their role upholding editorial standards. However, the overall responsibility for ruling on new BBC services, such as channel launches and major changes to the schedules, is likely to be ceded to the new \"Ofcom\" communications regulator, which will oversee the entire broadcasting industry, and possibly the internet and telephony as well. There had been serious calls for the governors to be abolished completely. Michael Jackson, the chief executive of Channel 4 and a former controller of BBC2, said in a speech earlier this year: \"The BBC's board of governors is not an adequate or sustainable form of independent regulation.\" The expert panel that advised the government on the future of the BBC's licence fee, chaired by the economist Gavyn Davies, said the governors were not an adequate form of regulation for the BBC because they were too closely associated with its management.",

      "bodyText": "Edward Bransfield, the long-forgotten British explorer who discovered Antarctica, is to be honoured nearly two centuries on, with a stamp commemorating his exploits. The Royal Navy officer made the first recorded sighting of the frozen continent, but his memory has been eclipsed by the romantic legends of the later explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. The stamp, to be issued in December, will bear the image of a British Antarctic survey ship named after Bransfield, and will be accompanied by one honouring Shackleton. A photograph or drawing of Bransfield himself was sought, but none could be found. The stamp marks the culmination of a campaign to restore Bransfield's place in history. At the forefront of this campaign, which has included the restoration of his neglected grave in Brighton, is the officer's great-great-great-great-niece, Sheila Bransfield. Born in Ireland circa 1785, Bransfield was master or navigator aboard HMS Andromache, based at Valparaiso, Chile, when a whaling ship arrived with news of land much further south than shown on existing maps. Bransfield commandeered a whaling brig, the Williams, and charted the South Shetland Islands, which lie near the Antarctic peninsula. He then landed on King George Island to take formal possession and coasted to Deception Island. Turning southward in January 1820, he made the historic sighting of \"high mountains, covered with snow\", thought to be mounts Bransfield and Jacquinot on the Antarctic mainland. On his return, however, Bransfield found the Admiralty had scant interest in his discovery. Ms Bransfield said: \"The emphasis was on finding the north-west passage. It seems as if they had absolutely no interest in the Antarctic. The navigator's name lives on, however, with a Mount Bransfield, Bransfield Island and Bransfield Strait in the Antarctic.",

By then the majority of electors will have made up their minds about how they are going to vote. According to the British election study (BES) which collected data shortly after the 1997 general election, some 63% of voters made up their minds before the short campaign and only 27% made up their minds during the official campaign itself.</p> <p>One of the features of the long campaign is the opportunity it provides for groups to lobby the government with the forthcoming contest in mind. Groups can threaten that their supporters will switch to rivals or abstain if the government does not change its policies. In recent months spokespeople for ethnic minorities, students, rural voters, women and supporters of the Labour heartlands have all used this tactic. Actually, it appears to have worked in the latter case, since the government has responded to disaffection in the Labour heartlands with plans for more cash for the regions.</p> <p>In fact, claims by many interest groups that their supporters can swing elections have little validity. Two factors determine clout. An interest group has to be big enough to matter in a significant number of seats. Secondly it has to be sufficiently cohesive - its members will vote on the basis of their group interests. The first requirement rules out students and ethnic minorities. They are just not numerous enough to influence the outcome in all but a handful of seats. The second requirement rules out women. Despite the fact that they are one of the largest groups with, arguably, common interests in electoral politics, the evidence is that women are not cohesive enough to vote on a clearly defined set of issues in order to shift the political agenda. Both factors rule out the Countryside Alliance. The rural vote, as opposed to the urban and suburban votes, is not that large in Britain and in any case the alliance does not speak for rural voters in general.</p> <p>\"Grey\" or retired voters are an exceptional interest group. They make up just over a fifth of the electorate, but represent about a quarter of voters because they are more likely to turn out than younger members of the population. Thus they meet the requirement of being a large group which is represented in all types of constituencies. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that they are willing to vote on the basis of perceived common interests.</p> <p>Many grey voters are poor and therefore care more than voters in general about welfare issues, including of course pensions. In addition, grey voters are more likely than the rest of the voting population to hold the government of the day responsible for their economic situation. In the 1997 BES survey, respondents were asked to indicate their preferences for taxation and spending along an 11-point scale, where a score of one meant that they were enthusiastic supporters of increased spending and higher taxation, and a score of 11 meant the opposite. A surprising 32% of grey voters were in the most enthusiastic taxing and spending category, compared with only 20% of voters in general.</p> <p>In addition, some 34% of young and middle-aged voters in the election study thought that their standard of living had increased since the previous election, but only 19% of grey voters believed this to be true. When asked if the Tory government was responsible for this, some 53% of grey voters thought that this was the case compared with only 42% of the rest. Thus grey voters felt worse off than voters in general and were more likely to hold the government responsible for this state of affairs. This evidence goes a long way to explaining why 38% of them supported Labour and only 29% the Tories in the 1997 general election.</p> <p>In a Gallup survey conducted in April this year only 24% of grey voters supported Labour against 38% for the Tories, in response to a question about their voting intentions. This suggests many of them have become disillusioned with New Labour since the election. Perhaps this is not surprising since New Labour's emphasis on the new and the dynamic tends to suggest that old people are a bit of an embarrassment. More to the point, the neglect of grey voters in relation to the pensions issue is having a political effect. The 75p pensions increase clearly did a lot of damage to Labour's support.</p> <p>I have tried to estimate the electoral consequences of neglecting the grey constituency. This can be done by rerunning the 1997 election using a computer simulation which keeps everything the same as it was in that election, with the exception of the grey vote. By substituting the grey vote estimated from the April 2000 Gallup poll for the vote recorded in 1997, it is possible to get an idea of its electoral importance.</p> <p>If grey voters had voted in 1997 the way they would now, Labour would have won 349 seats instead of 418. Putting this another way, some 69 Labour MPs are in jeopardy. The Liberal Democrats are also hit quite hard in this simulation, losing 21 of their 46 seats. The Tories gain 90 seats overall.</p> <p>The irony in all of this is that the Tories are unlikely to do anything significant to help grey voters on the pensions issue if they were elected, because they are strongly committed to tax cuts.

Analysis of the government's Spring 2000 Labour Force Survey by the Institute for Employment Studies shows a huge increase in the number of people working for their employer or client from home, up 19% on last year. One British worker in 17 now uses technology to give themselves a more flexible work pattern. Seven out of 10 teleworkers are men, and most are in senior positions.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 SKIP THE RUSH HOUR Have you ever considered becoming a teleworker, and doing your nine to five at home instead of in the office? If so, it seems you are not alone. Analysis of the government's Spring 2000 Labour Force Survey by the Institute for Employment Studies shows a huge increase in the number of people working for their employer or client from home, up 19% on last year. One British worker in 17 now uses technology to give themselves a more flexible work pattern. Seven out of 10 teleworkers are men, and most are in senior positions. Research indicates, though, that it is women who are the faster growing group favouring home over office. \u0095 LEARNING CURVE Need a bite-sized skills boost?

Obviously it helps if you start off liking each other, but it's the same as any relationship - you have to work at it to get it right.\" </p> <p>Edwards has been working for Hay since she was 21, and she believes their long-running partnership works so well because they communicate constantly. </p> <p>\"Andrew is frantically busy and he's out of the office about 50% of the time,\" she says. \"But we speak constantly - always in the morning and the evening, and several times throughout the day. Sometimes I can take 80 to 100 calls in a day and the only way to ensure that Andrew is up to date on everything is to keep talking to him. It means that there's much less room for error.\" </p> <p>As head of the department, Hay conducts viewings only on properties worth more than \u00a34m, but Edwards also makes the arrangements for clients who want to see other, less expensive properties. </p> <p>\"If Andrew is doing the viewing, then I make all his travel arrangements and speak to the client; if not, then I will organise one of our regional people to take the client around. I try to deal with as many enquiries about properties as possible; if we send out details of a house with Andrew as the contact name we may get hundreds of calls.

At times I feel a bit like I'm drowning, but the good thing is that I can tell Andrew that. He might ring up and ask why I haven't done a report when the phone hasn't stopped all day. But if I explain, he's always very understanding and he'll suggest things I could delegate to one of the other secretaries. I think it's essential to be honest - your boss can only help you out if he or she understands the situation.\" </p> <p>According to Edwards, the other key to a successful relationship is being able to have a laugh - but only at the right moment. \"A lot of the time the department is like a dealing floor and things are incredibly busy. That's the time I keep my head down and get on with the job in hand. But other times, at the beginning and end of the day, we have a real laugh and I think that's so important.

      "body": "<p>Telewest faces further stock market turbulence today amid takeover speculation prompted by last week's frosty reception of its interim profits figures. </p> <p>The rumours about the future ownership of the cable television and telephony group were so intense over the weekend that one potential bidder, Callahan Associates, was last night moved to deny an interest in the group. </p> <p>That means investors looking for some respite for Telewest's shares may need to rely on NTL, the group's closest rival, as being a more credible bidder. </p> <p>The slippery slope for Telewest, formed by the merger of Telewest and Flextech, began two weeks ago when the group announced difficulties with its planned roll out of digital television services. The shares have fallen 10% since the original announcement which has followed a strong performance from BSkyB in winning more digital television customers. Shares in Telewest closed at 160p on Friday. </p> <p>Yesterday Dick Callahan, head of Callahan Associates which already owns a range of cable interests across Europe, said a report that he had made a \u00a36bn offer for the group was \"absolutely not true\". </p> <p>NTL is regarded by the City as the preferred partner for Telewest and they have some shareholders in common. Microsoft is one, with a 23% stake in Telewest and 5% of NTL. But industry sources say that while Telewest's shares have been heading south - they hit a 20 month low on Thursday - NTL is also having a difficult time with investors. </p> <p>Both companies are saddled with large debts which might also make a merger difficult to finance even though Telewest is regarded as being prepared to engage in merger talks. Talk that Telewest is vulnerable to a takeover may be wide of the mark, however, as 50% of its shares are in the hands of two investors, US software firm Microsoft and Liberty Media. </p> <p>Telewest had been hoping to attract 500,000 customers for its digital television services by the end of the year but its technical problems have forced it to push that back to the first quarter of 2001. Last week, it reported a 35% rise in revenues to \u00a3514m for the six months to July but worsening pre-tax losses of \u00a3296m. </p> <p>Through a merger with NTL, Telewest is regarded as having more clout to squeeze the position of BSkyB which announced recently that it had taken 1m subscribers last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Telewest faces further stock market turbulence today amid takeover speculation prompted by last week's frosty reception of its interim profits figures. The rumours about the future ownership of the cable television and telephony group were so intense over the weekend that one potential bidder, Callahan Associates, was last night moved to deny an interest in the group. That means investors looking for some respite for Telewest's shares may need to rely on NTL, the group's closest rival, as being a more credible bidder. The slippery slope for Telewest, formed by the merger of Telewest and Flextech, began two weeks ago when the group announced difficulties with its planned roll out of digital television services. The shares have fallen 10% since the original announcement which has followed a strong performance from BSkyB in winning more digital television customers. Shares in Telewest closed at 160p on Friday. Yesterday Dick Callahan, head of Callahan Associates which already owns a range of cable interests across Europe, said a report that he had made a \u00a36bn offer for the group was \"absolutely not true\". NTL is regarded by the City as the preferred partner for Telewest and they have some shareholders in common. Microsoft is one, with a 23% stake in Telewest and 5% of NTL. But industry sources say that while Telewest's shares have been heading south - they hit a 20 month low on Thursday - NTL is also having a difficult time with investors. Both companies are saddled with large debts which might also make a merger difficult to finance even though Telewest is regarded as being prepared to engage in merger talks. Talk that Telewest is vulnerable to a takeover may be wide of the mark, however, as 50% of its shares are in the hands of two investors, US software firm Microsoft and Liberty Media. Telewest had been hoping to attract 500,000 customers for its digital television services by the end of the year but its technical problems have forced it to push that back to the first quarter of 2001. Last week, it reported a 35% rise in revenues to \u00a3514m for the six months to July but worsening pre-tax losses of \u00a3296m. Through a merger with NTL, Telewest is regarded as having more clout to squeeze the position of BSkyB which announced recently that it had taken 1m subscribers last year.",

      "bodyText": "Sean Rafferty offers the first of five 90-minute selections from the wide range on offer last month at one of Europe's newest music festivals. Morning Performance (11.30am, Radio 3) is devoted to the West Cork Chamber Music Festival, now in its fifth year and with a fast-growing reputation. Its repertoire runs from the Baroque to the contemporary, interspersing concerts with masterclasses. This session leans heavily on Mozart (pictured) and features Hallelujah Games, Amy Rubin's recent work for piano and percussion. In a new three-part series, Jolyon Jenkins investigates whether we can reinstate landscapes devastated by human activity. Engineering Eden (9.0pm, Radio 4) takes him to America to meet Steve Packard, who has galvanised 5,000 volunteers into rehabilitating 27,000 acres of mid-Western prairie, ideally with buffalo herds grazing there again. Further south, the Army Corps of Engineers hopes to restore the Florida Everglades to something near their primordial glory.",

Only the fleets in New York and Tokyo are bigger - the difference is that in Sao Paulo the craft are mainly privately owned.</p> <p>Well-off Paulistanos use their helicopters not only for commuting but also for travelling to their weekend beach homes, and even for shopping. The boom has been so great in recent years that some apartment blocks lack the parking space to cope with the demand.</p> <p>\"Having a helicopter is not only accepted here but it is considered a necessary tool for existing,\" said Fabrice Cagnat, commercial director for Helibras, the Brazilian subsidiary of Eurocopter.</p> <p>Sao Paulo's penchant for helicopters has grown partly as a result of its exaggerated social divides, in a country with one of the world's most unfair distributions of wealth. Kidnappings and carjackings are daily occurrences, and a growing number of Paulistanos are willing to pay up to put themselves out of danger by flying the skies.</p> <p>Commander Marcos Braga, vice-president of the the Pilots' Association, said: \"Helicopters bring security. Not just top executives but medium-level businessmen are realising it is worth it.\"</p> <p>In the past 100 years Sao Paulo has become Latin America's most important industrial and financial centre, and the engine that drives the Brazilian economy. But its infrastructure has not kept up with the steep rise in population caused by the millions of migrants who have arrived from poorer parts of the country seeking work.</p> <p>With only three underground lines, no proper network of major roads, and a significant part of the population rich enough to afford cars, massive traffic delays are inevitable.</p> <p>\"At some times during the day it can take three hours to cross from the north of the city to the south. In a helicopter you can do it in five to seven minutes,\" Fabrice Cagnat said.</p> <p>Since 1994 the number of helicopters in Sao Paulo has quadrupled to about 450, compared to 700 in Tokyo and 2,000 in New York.</p> <p>\"From my point of view the boom has hardly started,\" Commander Braga said.</p> <p>\"There would be a lot more helicopters if it wasn't for the currency crash in 1999. Growth has already climbed to 30% this year. And people are buying bigger helicopters too.\"</p> <p>On Avenida Paulista, Sao Paulo's main business street, there are about 80 helicopter landings a day.</p> <p>For the Sao Paulo Formula One race at Interlagos earlier this year, helicopters made 2,000 landings.</p> <p>\"Already we are seeing traffic jams in the sky,\" a pilot said.</p> <p>The new helicopter society is changing the landscape of Sao Paulo. As you fly into the city's airport you can see dozens of helipads on the high-rise buildings. Even shopping centres have started to cater for aerial arrivals.</p>",

Well-off Paulistanos use their helicopters not only for commuting but also for travelling to their weekend beach homes, and even for shopping. The boom has been so great in recent years that some apartment blocks lack the parking space to cope with the demand. \"Having a helicopter is not only accepted here but it is considered a necessary tool for existing,\" said Fabrice Cagnat, commercial director for Helibras, the Brazilian subsidiary of Eurocopter. Sao Paulo's penchant for helicopters has grown partly as a result of its exaggerated social divides, in a country with one of the world's most unfair distributions of wealth. Kidnappings and carjackings are daily occurrences, and a growing number of Paulistanos are willing to pay up to put themselves out of danger by flying the skies. Commander Marcos Braga, vice-president of the the Pilots' Association, said: \"Helicopters bring security. Not just top executives but medium-level businessmen are realising it is worth it.\" In the past 100 years Sao Paulo has become Latin America's most important industrial and financial centre, and the engine that drives the Brazilian economy. But its infrastructure has not kept up with the steep rise in population caused by the millions of migrants who have arrived from poorer parts of the country seeking work. With only three underground lines, no proper network of major roads, and a significant part of the population rich enough to afford cars, massive traffic delays are inevitable. \"At some times during the day it can take three hours to cross from the north of the city to the south. In a helicopter you can do it in five to seven minutes,\" Fabrice Cagnat said. Since 1994 the number of helicopters in Sao Paulo has quadrupled to about 450, compared to 700 in Tokyo and 2,000 in New York. \"From my point of view the boom has hardly started,\" Commander Braga said. \"There would be a lot more helicopters if it wasn't for the currency crash in 1999. Growth has already climbed to 30% this year. And people are buying bigger helicopters too.\" On Avenida Paulista, Sao Paulo's main business street, there are about 80 helicopter landings a day. For the Sao Paulo Formula One race at Interlagos earlier this year, helicopters made 2,000 landings. \"Already we are seeing traffic jams in the sky,\" a pilot said. The new helicopter society is changing the landscape of Sao Paulo. As you fly into the city's airport you can see dozens of helipads on the high-rise buildings. Even shopping centres have started to cater for aerial arrivals.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was the night before the German grand prix, and David Coulthard was doing the ironing. This is not something you would expect to read in connection with the great heroes of motor racing history. Who could imagine the Marques Alfonso de Portago y Cabeza - Ferrari driver of the 50s, Olympic fencer, bobsleigh champion and legendary lover - doing the domestic chores?</p> <p>But the times are different, and so is David Coulthard, the courteous, unassuming and thoroughly sensible 29-year-old Scottish grand prix driver who hit the front pages three months ago when he pulled his fianc\u00e9e from the wreckage of a private jet in which the pilot and co-pilot had perished. Coulthard is different from the heroes of the mythical past, different even from his contemporaries. And different, some say, from the David Coulthard that he used to be.</p> <p>A year ago Coulthard would have stuffed his dirty washing in a hotel laundry bag and called down to get it picked up. If a friend asked him which hotel he was in, he would probably have needed to consult his key tag. This year, all that has changed. Instead of leapfrogging from hotel to hotel, now Coulthard parks a large blue and white motorhome - the colours of his racing helmet, patterned on the flag of St Andrew - in a corner of the pad dock. In the virtual world of Bernie Ecclestone's formula one, this looks very much like one man's way of restoring a bit of normality to his life.</p> <p>\"That's absolutely correct,\" he says, sitting in the office of his father's haulage company in Twynholm, a village half an hour's drive from Dumfries. And, with telling clarity, he recalls the decisive moment. \"One day, about two years ago, I was at a test session in France, at the Magny Cours circuit, and I felt absolutely lifeless. I remember finishing early and checking in at the hotel and asking at the reception, 'What is there to do in this area?' And the guy didn't have an answer for me because there was nothing to do. Magny Cours is in the middle of nowhere. I went to my room. I had a book to read but I had no motivation to do that, and there was no one that I particularly wanted to talk to on the phone. I thought, what am I doing? It just felt like I was giving away part of my life to ... nothing. That's when I decided to get the motorhome.\"</p> <p>Racing drivers don't often talk like this. More usually, they want you to know what a great time they had with a bunch of supermodels at that party in Milan last week, or how fast their new speedboat will go. Coulthard is indeed engaged to be married to a model, the very thin and very blonde Heidi Wichlinksi, and his current salary is around \u00a35m a year but he seems to have held on to the sort of self-questioning modesty that befits his solid upbringing in a village where the name of Seaman Thos W Coulthard RN is on the memorial to the victims of the 1914-18 war.</p> <p>\"I suppose this is slightly bizarre,\" he says, \"but last weekend at Hockenheim I was in the motorhome alone because Heidi was working, and I did some laundry. I did some ironing - I haven't ironed in a long time. I guess it doesn't sound very glamorous, but I thoroughly enjoyed ironing a pair of trousers and watching the telly and getting myself ready for the next day. I like organising my own little environment. I can invite into it those I want to be there and keep out those I don't.\"</p> <p>Along with the desire to reclaim a bit of his life this year came a deter mination to rid himself of the reputation for lacking a mean streak on the track, largely the result of his honourable behaviour in Australia in 1998, when he stuck by the terms of a pre-race agreement and moved aside to let his team-mate, Mika Hakkinen, win the race. \"I went through a period when I was perceived as being a soft touch, somebody who moves over, who is not hungry enough to win,\" he says.</p> <p>Some suggest the ordeal of the air crash added a final touch of steely resolution to his character.

He has been racing since his father put him in a go-kart at the age of eight, he made his formula one debut in 1994, as Damon Hill's team-mate, and he currently stands second in the championship, which intensifies the requirement for him to fit endless sponsorship commitments around his schedule. And now, in Twynholm, his father has opened a small David Coulthard museum. But the image side of the grand prix world is not his thing. \"I go through periods when I think that, other than on the track, this isn't really very much fun,\" he says. \"It's having to try to deal with the constant questioning when things aren't going very well, people poking you to try and get a response and perhaps taking you close to the edge emotionally.\"</p> <p>He lives in Monaco, like several of his rivals. \"It's a very closed, controlled environment,\" he says, with evident approval. \"When you're there you don't get any reminders that you're a grand prix driver. But every other Thursday, when I walk through into the paddock at a grand prix, and there are 1,000 cameras there, the reality comes back - this is the part of this world that I don't like, but I have to endure it because it gets me to the bit I do enjoy.\"</p> <p>As a man to whom being grown-up means being in control of his emotions, he dislikes leaping around on the victory rostrum but does it because that's what the photographers want. \"I think, why the hell do I have to be a showman? But then I realise that the reason you get the opportunity to do this is because of the public's dream that it must be fantastic to do this job, and they want to see that it's fantastic. They want to live it through you. I haven't quite sussed that part out yet, and I don't know if I ever will.\"</p> <p>One part he may be getting sussed out is the significance of personal conflict, a vital factor in formula one's vast box-office appeal. As a boy, Coulthard watched on television as Mansell, Prost, Senna and Piquet fought often ill-tempered battles. Now he and Michael Schumacher are indulging in an acrimonious run ning squabble of their own. Two years ago, after a couple of mid-race collisions, Schumacher accused Coulthard of trying to kill him. This season the German and the Scot have tangled again. \"It makes life a wee bit interesting,\" he says, without giving the impression that he enjoys it.</p> <p>So what does he really think of Schumacher? \"Two different things. As a man I think he's a decent guy, a family man, quite straightforward. Given the hero worship and his vast wealth, it would be very easy for him not to be quite as normal as he is, privately. Publicly, as a racing driver, I'm not entirely comfortable with his inability to realise that he does make mistakes and it's not always someone else who's entirely to blame.</p> <p>\"I had a conversation with him last year, and I said: 'In your home, are you always right and your wife is always wrong?' He went: 'No, no, that's different.'</p> <p>\"I said: 'It's not different. It's values. It's understanding what right and wrong are. I believe I have those values and you clearly don't. Now we can leave this room today and never speak to each other again, and I'll have a happy life and you'll have a happy life, but it would be a shame because we live in the same world, as competitors, and part of the enjoyment I get from competing is to look my fellow competitors in the eye. The human side is very important.'</p> <p>\"He had to agree on that and we shook hands and walked away. Until the next time we fell out.\"</p> <p>Their latest spat erupted when Coulthard complained about Schumacher's habit of weaving across the track. For a couple of races they didn't talk to each other but before the grand prix in Germany 10 days ago, Schumacher made an unexpected move. \"It was a bit like what happens after two kids have fallen out in the playground. Eventually the one who thinks that maybe he was a little bit wrong makes the gesture of coming back and saying, 'Do you want a sweetie?' As we were coming out of one of the corners in the forest, Michael tapped me on the shoulder and said: 'Do you think there should be a kerb on the outside of this corner?' There was absolutely no need for a kerb at that part of the circuit. But I took it as his gesture at trying to start the conversation again.

At Hockenheim last year I remember him saying to me, 'I can't do this any more.' I was pretty shocked. I was thinking, God, we've still got a few races to go - if you're saying that, why not stop now? Why take the risk? There are considerable risks in doing these speeds, and if you don't see that as a challenge and a thrill, then it's got to be too frightening.

      "bodyText": "It was the night before the German grand prix, and David Coulthard was doing the ironing. This is not something you would expect to read in connection with the great heroes of motor racing history. Who could imagine the Marques Alfonso de Portago y Cabeza - Ferrari driver of the 50s, Olympic fencer, bobsleigh champion and legendary lover - doing the domestic chores? But the times are different, and so is David Coulthard, the courteous, unassuming and thoroughly sensible 29-year-old Scottish grand prix driver who hit the front pages three months ago when he pulled his fianc\u00e9e from the wreckage of a private jet in which the pilot and co-pilot had perished. Coulthard is different from the heroes of the mythical past, different even from his contemporaries. And different, some say, from the David Coulthard that he used to be. A year ago Coulthard would have stuffed his dirty washing in a hotel laundry bag and called down to get it picked up. If a friend asked him which hotel he was in, he would probably have needed to consult his key tag. This year, all that has changed. Instead of leapfrogging from hotel to hotel, now Coulthard parks a large blue and white motorhome - the colours of his racing helmet, patterned on the flag of St Andrew - in a corner of the pad dock. In the virtual world of Bernie Ecclestone's formula one, this looks very much like one man's way of restoring a bit of normality to his life. \"That's absolutely correct,\" he says, sitting in the office of his father's haulage company in Twynholm, a village half an hour's drive from Dumfries. And, with telling clarity, he recalls the decisive moment. \"One day, about two years ago, I was at a test session in France, at the Magny Cours circuit, and I felt absolutely lifeless. I remember finishing early and checking in at the hotel and asking at the reception, 'What is there to do in this area?' And the guy didn't have an answer for me because there was nothing to do. Magny Cours is in the middle of nowhere. I went to my room. I had a book to read but I had no motivation to do that, and there was no one that I particularly wanted to talk to on the phone. I thought, what am I doing? It just felt like I was giving away part of my life to ... nothing. That's when I decided to get the motorhome.\" Racing drivers don't often talk like this. More usually, they want you to know what a great time they had with a bunch of supermodels at that party in Milan last week, or how fast their new speedboat will go. Coulthard is indeed engaged to be married to a model, the very thin and very blonde Heidi Wichlinksi, and his current salary is around \u00a35m a year but he seems to have held on to the sort of self-questioning modesty that befits his solid upbringing in a village where the name of Seaman Thos W Coulthard RN is on the memorial to the victims of the 1914-18 war. \"I suppose this is slightly bizarre,\" he says, \"but last weekend at Hockenheim I was in the motorhome alone because Heidi was working, and I did some laundry. I did some ironing - I haven't ironed in a long time. I guess it doesn't sound very glamorous, but I thoroughly enjoyed ironing a pair of trousers and watching the telly and getting myself ready for the next day. I like organising my own little environment. I can invite into it those I want to be there and keep out those I don't.\" Along with the desire to reclaim a bit of his life this year came a deter mination to rid himself of the reputation for lacking a mean streak on the track, largely the result of his honourable behaviour in Australia in 1998, when he stuck by the terms of a pre-race agreement and moved aside to let his team-mate, Mika Hakkinen, win the race. \"I went through a period when I was perceived as being a soft touch, somebody who moves over, who is not hungry enough to win,\" he says. Some suggest the ordeal of the air crash added a final touch of steely resolution to his character. He is reluctant to discuss the event and its consequences, unwilling to do anything that might cause further distress to the families of the two men who died, but in any case such a melodramatic claim crumbles under scrutiny. Since the accident he has indeed won two races, but he had won at Silverstone immediately before it. Tall, slender and unusually square-jawed, Coulthard can look - sitting in his car during a practice session, wearing his flameproof balaclava - like a Burne-Jones knight on the eve of battle.

Although the talks broke off last month without agreement, the Israelis and Palestinians - and the Americans, who are trying to broker a peace settlement between the two - all refuse to cast the initial summit as a failure, arguing that they had reached \"understandings\" in several areas. The Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'aretz said secret talks got under way last week between Israeli cabinet ministers and senior Palestinian officials to explore potential areas for compromise on the most contentious issues dividing them: the status of the square kilometre of hallowed ground within the old walled city of Jerusalem, and the future of 3.6m registered Palestinian refugees. Another senior Palestinian negotiator said that efforts would be redoubled in the run-up to September 13.

An estimate in the Moroccan daily Lib\u00e9ration said over 3,000. No one really knows.</p> <p>Increasingly desperate, the Spanish government has toughened its controls. Under the old law illegal immigrants were entitled to stay in Spain after two years in the country with a job. Now the threshold has been raised to five years, and it will be harder to bring in relatives and easier to throw immigrants out.</p> <p>The law includes measures against human traffickers and fines of up to 10m pesetas (\u00a337,000) for employing illegals.</p> <p>Until the 1970's Spain was itself an exporter of labour. Now part of the affluent north, it is struggling to keep immigrants out while pressing the EU to invest more on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to stop them coming.</p> <p>Immigrants from Morocco and other parts of north and sub-Saharan Africa have been joined more recently by eastern Europeans and Pakistanis crossing the Pyrenees.</p> <p>Spain is torn between its need for labour and its fear of integrating newcomers in a society that has stayed remarkably homogeneous since the end of the 15th century when Jews and Arabs were expelled. Foreigners form only 2% of the population, about 1m people; just under half of these are northern Europeans living in the affluent coastal ghettos.</p> <p>One of a series of amnesties for illegal immigrants has just ended. The number of applicants for legal status was more then twice that expected: 180,000 will achieve legal status as a result; several thousand will be turned away.</p> <p>In December a new law provided for about 70,000 immigrants to settle each year. But the centre-right government, fearing a racist backlash, has retreated from full implementation. In the past year there have been clashes in Andalusia and Catalonia, where many immigrants do the jobs Spaniards no longer wish to take on.</p> <p>Civil guards patrol the notorious N340 coast road north of Algeciras to try to stop trucks and vans packed full of immigrants. \"It's only a matter of time,\" one said, \" before something happens here like the Dover disaster\" when 58 Chinese would-be immigrants were found dead in June of heat and suffocation in a lorry.</p>",

As a signatory to the Schengen treaty - the agreement by which a majority of EU members have sought to eliminate border controls between themselves - Spain has the thankless task of policing one of the main southern routes for illegal entrants: across the Strait of Gibraltar, where the gap between rich and poor is just 20 miles of hazardous water. The Spanish authorities say that at least 250 people have died trying to cross since 1998. An estimate in the Moroccan daily Lib\u00e9ration said over 3,000. No one really knows. Increasingly desperate, the Spanish government has toughened its controls. Under the old law illegal immigrants were entitled to stay in Spain after two years in the country with a job. Now the threshold has been raised to five years, and it will be harder to bring in relatives and easier to throw immigrants out. The law includes measures against human traffickers and fines of up to 10m pesetas (\u00a337,000) for employing illegals. Until the 1970's Spain was itself an exporter of labour. Now part of the affluent north, it is struggling to keep immigrants out while pressing the EU to invest more on the southern shores of the Mediterranean to stop them coming. Immigrants from Morocco and other parts of north and sub-Saharan Africa have been joined more recently by eastern Europeans and Pakistanis crossing the Pyrenees. Spain is torn between its need for labour and its fear of integrating newcomers in a society that has stayed remarkably homogeneous since the end of the 15th century when Jews and Arabs were expelled. Foreigners form only 2% of the population, about 1m people; just under half of these are northern Europeans living in the affluent coastal ghettos. One of a series of amnesties for illegal immigrants has just ended. The number of applicants for legal status was more then twice that expected: 180,000 will achieve legal status as a result; several thousand will be turned away. In December a new law provided for about 70,000 immigrants to settle each year. But the centre-right government, fearing a racist backlash, has retreated from full implementation. In the past year there have been clashes in Andalusia and Catalonia, where many immigrants do the jobs Spaniards no longer wish to take on. Civil guards patrol the notorious N340 coast road north of Algeciras to try to stop trucks and vans packed full of immigrants. \"It's only a matter of time,\" one said, \" before something happens here like the Dover disaster\" when 58 Chinese would-be immigrants were found dead in June of heat and suffocation in a lorry.",

      "bodyText": "The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the reformist parliament yesterday to abandon its promise to expand freedom of speech and revive the banned progressive press. It was seen as a step toward re-asserting clerical rule over participatory democracy. Ayatollah Khamenei's action runs counter to the hopes of millions whose votes in February's general election sent to parliament a majority of reformists who had run on platforms including a free press. Using his powers to intervene in the legislative process, the ayatollah issued a letter to the 290 MPs concerning a new bill meant to amend the restrictive press law. When the letter was read aloud in the chamber, scuffles broke out on the floor. \"If the enemies infiltrate the press, this will be a big danger to the country's security and the people's religious beliefs,\" he wrote. \"I do not deem it right to keep silent . . . The bill is not legitimate and not in the interest of the system and the revolution.\" Iranians have been waiting to see when and how the conservative establishment would try to use its overwhelming power to challenge republican rule. Under the constitution, the supreme leader, who is appointed by a body of conservative clerics, has the final say in all matters of state. But it came as a surprise that Ayatollah Khamenei intervened in such a blatant and public way. Some MPs voiced outrage and threatened to resign. Others said they planned to write to Ayatollah Khamenei in protest, and reformist sources said they were afraid that one of their colleagues could face criminal charges for protesting against the leader's action too vociferously. The Iranian press has given the reform movement a powerful voice; the ayatollah used a speech in April to label some newspapers, \"bases of the enemy\". For this reason, conservatives in the judiciary shut down these publications, beginning in April, and jailed at least half a dozen editors and commentators. Some were imprisoned for up to five years; others were released on bail but banned from involvement in writing or publishing. Yesterday the reformist MPs were poised to make such restrictive measures more difficult by passing a new press law which would require legal action to be taken against newspaper publishers, rather than against individual writers, thus lifting the threat of jail sentences from journalists. The law would have changed the composition of a press supervisory board, which licenses publications, to include more reformers. Reformist MPs knew that the extent of their power remained uncertain. Even if they had rallied a majority to vote for the bill, it could still have been vetoed by the Guardian Council, a body of conservative clerics and jurists charged with deciding if legislation conforms to Islamic law. It often uses this power to veto legislation it disagrees with for political reasons. Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of parliament and the head of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the reformers' biggest faction, which functions like a political party, acknowledged the movement's limitations last week. Mr Khatami, the brother of President Mohammad Khatami, said the new MPs should lower their expectations for change. The parliamentary speaker, Mehdi Karroubi, a senior cleric approved by Ayatollah Khomenei to lead parliament against the wishes of the reformers, reminded MPs of the limitations of republican rule. \"Our constitution has the elements of the absolute rule of the supreme clerical leader and you all know this and approve of this,\" he said. \"We are all duty-bound to abide by it.\" To counter the gains that reformers have made through the ballot box in municipal and parliamentary elections, conservatives have asserted their power in the judiciary and law enforcement - the institutions they dominate. Many reformers now say publicly that it will take many years to achieve political pluralism. Mohsen Kadivar, a prominent cleric who was released from prison after being given an 18-month sentence, said it was unrealistic to expect freedom of speech in Iran to happen quickly.

The man they still call El Comandante remains a pop icon. 10. Images of Che in revolutionary mode abound on the net. You can also hear him, and discuss him. And, of course, buy the tee-shirt.",

Working in a cafe was never going to give her enough money for drama school. \"I was having this not very great affair. I was feeling a bit raw. If life had been sunny, I probably wouldn't have done it.\" </p> <p>She steeled herself to walk down the steps into a Soho basement (\"You really felt you were going into the underworld\"), and found that the audition gave an unlikely boost to her self-esteem. \"I was amazed I got through it. There were about 20 of us and we had to walk into this room in front of this funny little guy who said, 'OK, get yer clothes off and let's see you move.' He put this sexy music on and we all bumbled around. There was this Yugoslavian girl and she was very beautiful and moved like a cat. I thought, 'Oh, my God, what am I doing?'

For Lenkiewicz, who also performs in the play, the experience of stripping for \"deflated, worried and rather unhappy men\" every night for two months was rewarding. \"OK, it wasn't like doing a year with VSO, and it is not something I am exactly proud of - as a little girl you don't dream of being a table dancer - but it has enriched me and my understanding of people. I did meet one or two unhappy women, but very few felt like victims. You didn't feel you were pouring your soul down the drain. They were good women.
