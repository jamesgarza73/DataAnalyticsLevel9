For the first quarter of Mona Yahia's book, few arrive. Set in 1960s Baghdad, its landscape and social networks seem very foreign. </p> <p>It tells the story of Jewish life in Baghdad in the aftermath of the Six Day War where, according to rumour, the Grey Beetle is the preferred car of the security police. Clearly autobiographical, it's narrated in the first person by Lina, the 14-year-old youngest child in a middle-class Jewish family whose father is sacked and elder brother arrested. As the show-trials are televised, the obsession with (forbidden) emigration becomes even more intense. </p> <p>Since reading never takes place in a vacuum, a book about the vulnerability of the Jewish community in Iraq in the past inevitably invites a little sniffiness when set beside the vulnerability of the Palestinian community in Israel in the present. But around page 85, something wonderful happens: it turns into a very fine and original first novel. </p> <p>Is that because it's here that we meet the book's only English character, a new young neighbour called Laurence? Or because Laurence's ability to be duped by kitsch fantasies about the Orient make us realise that we've been drawn beyond such caricatures into a deeper sense of Iraqi life ? </p> <p>Certainly Yahia rolls Baghdad around her tongue, savouring its suks, smells, and sweetmeats (reading her makes one hungry). This is a truly exotic novel, but it's also a coming-of-age work in which the almost imperceptible transformation from childhood to adolescence is saltily observed and never sentimentalised. </p> <p>Above all Yahia has fashioned a teeming treasury of stories: how Zeki courted Dunia via the street vendors, for instance (he teaches them love-verses which they sing to her when she buys their wares; shades here - as elsewhere - of Rushdie). </p> <p>One of Yahia's themes is language. These Iraqi Jews are oriental to their taste-buds, but as Jewish life in Baghdad gets harder, Lina resolves to eliminate from her writing and speech, one by one, Arabic letters and words (of which the book is full). In a vendetta against the thundering language of the oppressor, she declares triumphantly: \"I have at last forced Arabic to stutter.\" </p> <p>Yahia's prose courses with insight and wit. Her deftness of touch means that, despite its subject-matter, this novel never becomes a bleak tale of religious persecution, but remains a fresh story about adolescent experience in adversity - with parallels in the most unlikely places.</p>",

When the old coach route from Lancaster to Kendal used to take this perilous shortcut, as painted by Turner, several coaches were either sucked under by the sands or overtaken by the incoming tide, which rushes in at up to 3ft high and at the speed of a galloping horse. A memorial in Cartmel churchyard to 140 victims starkly testifies to the dangers of underestimating the sands. </p> <p>Cedric is the proud holder of the title of Sand Pilot - officially the Queen's Guide to the Sands, an ancient honour dating back to the 14th century. He became the 25th royally-appointed Guide in 1963. Since then, he has successfully guided more than a third of a million people across the bay, an average of 10,000 a year. And in all those years, his salary as Queen's Guide has remained constant at a modest \u00a315 a year, although he was awarded an MBE for his services on a rare visit to London last year. </p> <p>The 2000 crossing season has just ended early because, according to Cedric, it was just \"too dangerous\" to continue. \"The summer and autumn rains have made this the hardest season ever for route-finding,\" he says. \"The channels have constantly changed and the areas of quicksand in the gulleys have been terrible - the biggest I have ever seen. When the rain comes off the fells and drains into the bay, it has to go somewhere, so the sands get saturated, just like the fields do.\" </p> <p>Cedric demonstrated the dangers by stepping out on to an apparently-innocuous area, which wobbled and quaked like a jelly, threatening to suck him under at every step. \"The rule is,\" he explained, \"if it bends, it'll bear; but if it breaks, get out!\" </p> <p>Much careful preparation goes into making each crossing safe. Cedric goes out the day before, testing the sands, checking the tides and marking the safest, zigzag route between Arnside and Grange with laurel-branch markers known as \"brobs\". </p> <p>Even so, walkers attempting the route should expect to get rather more than their feet wet. As well as splashing through a number of shallower \"dykes\", you need to cross the channel of the River Kent, whose icy waters can come up to thigh level. </p> <p>The eight-mile walk usually starts from the esplanade in front of The Albion public house in the charmingly-unspoilt Victorian seaside resort of Arnside. </p> <p>Although the safe route can change from day to day, it usually starts by heading south west across the flat, wave-worn limestone rocks of the foreshore to the shingle bay of White Creek. This is where you remove your shoes and socks ready for the actual crossing. Your destination at Kents Bank is clearly visible, a mere two miles away as the oystercatcher (known locally as a \"sea-a-pie\") flies. But Cedric's route can be up to four times as long, as it zigzags between the sand banks and gulleys. </p> <p>If you are lucky, the sun will be shining and the sands will shimmer and live up to their name as the \"wet Sahara\". This is how Cedric likes it. Leaning on his trusty staff, he looks north towards the Lake District fells which feed the estuary and remarks: \"It's a magical place, and I just couldn't imagine living anywhere else.\" </p> <p>After some time walking almost due south, apparently straight out into the Irish Sea and away from your destination, Cedric turns west towards the highlight of the trip - the crossing of the Kent channel. </p> <p>The last time I was here, early in the season, Cedric had warned us that it would be cold, and the ochre-coloured river water took the breath away. But the crossing is soon over, and you wade triumphantly out on to the firmer, rippled sands on the Cumbrian side. </p> <p>It is now a few hundred yards to dry land, and you make your landfall near to Regional Rail's Kents Bank station. A superb, scenic way back to your starting point is to catch the eastbound train across the long, low Arnside viaduct. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> All crossings of Morecambe Bay must be made in the company of the Queen's Guide, Cedric Robinson, whose wife, Olive, makes the bookings from their home at Guide's Farm, Grange-over-Sands (tel: 015395 32165). The crossing season usually runs from April to October, but is entirely dependent on the weather and the state of the sands. </p> <p> The eight-mile route takes about three and a half hours and is easy walking, but be prepared to get wet. The area is covered by the Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 Landranger No 97, Kendal &amp; Morecambe, but don't be tempted by the public byway route marked across Warton Sands from Hest Bank to Kents Bank.

French Railways in Piccadilly (0870 5848848) can advise on cheap runabout tickets and other fares and reservations on the Continent and issue tickets. It does not take long on day and overnight trains to get to the warm parts of Spain, Portugal and Italy.

The adventure companies, Explore, Travelbag etc don't double their prices, nor is there a single-person supplement. New Millennium holidays are excellent value.

Doesn't she realise she's no worse off than anybody with school-age children, many of whom earn a good deal less than she does? She's certainly better off than the support staff in her own school who not only get paid less to start with and may not get paid at all in the holidays but can still only go at peak times. <br>JE Howard</p> <p>I recommend that Hilary Matthews investigates the possibilities of a house exchange. I am a teacher and have had holidays in America, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain France, Holland and Italy without spending a fortune. It's a brilliant way of really seeing a country. There are lots of different exchange organisations to choose from. <br>Alan Harding</p> <p> We find that booking flights and hotels ourselves is the best way to travel cheaply during the school holidays. This summer we spent a few days in Stockholm travelling with Ryanair. As teachers we do have some flexibility - we can go on holiday anytime over the six-week summer break. This October half term we spent three days in Prague, the scheduled flights cost us less than \u00a3100 return. These flights were booked on Expedia back in March. Planning ahead here helped a lot. Shop around, and keep your eyes open all year round for good deals would be our top tip. <br>David Williams</p> <p> Avoid package holidays. Book your flight or ferry without booking accommodation, then book your accommodation from within the country. I normally avoid school holidays for travelling, but had no option last year as I wanted to see the eclipse. So, having booked only the ferry crossing, I set off with a bike and a tent for a memorable week's cycling in France that certainly did not break the bank. My brother - a teacher - has managed cheap travel by booking with no-frills airlines and heading east. This summer he travelled round Slovakia by train, staying in local hotels. The prices may have doubled because it was August, but would have been cheap at twice the price. <br>Ellie Mayor</p> <p> Have you ever considered a coach holiday on the continent?

Last February half term we toured through Vienna, Prague and Budapest for \u00a3219, and the previous February we went to the Italian Dolomites visiting Lake Garda, Venice and Verona (\u00a3189). We have booked to go to Lloret de Mar in Spain next February with <a href=\"http://www.shearingsholidays.com\" target=\"_new\">Shearing Holidays</a>for \u00a3189.

      "body": "<p>As the hugely successful author of The Cat In The Hat, Green Eggs And Ham and more than 40 other children's books, Ted \"Dr Seuss\" Geisel was frequently approached by companies keen to use his fantastical cartoons or bizarre rhyming verses. But, despite the large wads of cash to be made, Geisel routinely refused such offers. One day, however, his attorney Herb Cheyette contacted the author with an offer that surely even he couldn't refuse. A television sponsor was prepared to pay \"a vast sum of money\" if they could license an unpublished verse for use on a Christmas billboard. Geisel remained adamant that he didn't want to be connected to any single product. Presuming that Geisel was just playing hardball, the company increased the offer. \"This verse totals less than a hundred words,\" Cheyette informed his client. \"If you accept this deal, you will go into The Guinness Book Of Records as the writer who received the most money per word.\" Geisel's reply was unequivocal. \"I'd rather go into The Guinness Book Of Records,\" said the author, who died in 1991, \"as the writer who refused the most money per word.\"</p> <p>It is difficult not to recall Geisel's comment when considering the veritable mega-tsunami of tie-ins that have been constructed around the $100m Jim Carrey-starring adaptation of Geisel's book, How The Grinch Stole Christmas! Sure, a good deal of the revenue from such deals - plus the \u00a38m that Universal ponied up for the rights - will go straight to the Seuss Foundation charity, now overseen by Geisel's widow Audrey. Yet if the author was horrified at the idea of an unpublished poem being used on a billboard, one can only wonder at his reaction to the fact that Americans can now buy Cat In The Hat gonks with their Grinch credit card before chowing down on a Dr Seuss-themed meal at Wendy's. But, while Geisel seems like an almost Naomi Klein-like figure of marketing restraint compared to the brand-crazy Walt Disney, he was not entirely averse to licensing out his creations. In 1983, for example, the author signed a $10m contract with Cabbage Patch Doll-manufacturers Coleco, only nixing the deal when the company proved unable to produce a Cat In The Hat doll capable of matching his perfectionist standards. Then again, Geisel was a contradictory figure. Although by the end of his life the greying, bearded author resembled every kid's idea of a lovably roguish grandfather, he never actually had any children himself and was rumoured not even to like them. \"He could tolerate a couple at a time,\" admits his widow today. </p> <p>\"But that was his limit.\"</p> <p>Geisel himself repeatedly denied having any problems with the ankle-biting community who in turn regarded him as an almost mythic figure, sending the author thousands of letters every month (\"98% of them misspelt,\" Geisel would dryly note). It was an adoration that was deserved, as Geisel effectively saved early readers around the world from dull-arse Peter-and-Jane-go-to-the-shops-and-come-back-again primers, offering them instead an enchanting world of empty-but-walking trousers, bizarrely coloured cooked meats and North-Going Zax. Moreover, while parents could only applaud the moral to be found in a book like Green Eggs And Ham - \"don't be afraid of trying new things\" - the horribly determined way in which \"Sam-I-am\" tries to foist his comestibles on Geisel's hero indicated to children that they had found someone who was very much on their side. There is no doubt, though, that writing children's books was not Geisel's first choice of activity when casting about for something to do in his spare time while employed churning out ads for Standard Oil during the 30s. Unfortunately, the terms of his contract precluded him from doing anything else. But Geisel had no intention of putting his patronym to such juvenilia - intending to save that for his proposed great American novel - and decided instead to use his middle name. And so, with the publication of 1937's And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, Dr Seuss - Children's Author was born. (The \"Dr\" part was initially fictitious, but Geisel would eventually be granted a doctorate from his alma mater, Dartmouth, making him, as the author liked to point out, 'Dr Dr Seuss').</p> <p>Although featuring recognisably Seuss-esque illustrations combined with his distinctive rhyming verse, Mulberry Street failed to make much impact on the public. Geisel's career as an author was soon put on indefinite hold when he was recruited to make propaganda movies during the second world war under the guidance of Frank Capra. When the war ended, Geisel continued his association with Tinseltown by writing the critically slammed 5,000 Fingers Of Dr T and working on an abortive early attempt to adapt Rebel Without A Cause. With his Hollywood career in tatters and his reputation as a children's author less than stellar, Geisel pinned most of his hopes on the still unfinished Great American Novel.</p> <p>\"I happened to find it six months ago,\" Geisel said in 1972. \"It was very avant-garde and there were whole passages of Italian in it. Which I don't understand because I can't speak a word of Italian.\"</p> <p>Geisel's life changed forever in 1954 when Life magazine published an article which found novelist John Hersey bemoaning the fact that his kids were growing up illiterate thanks to the boring nature of school primer books and concluding that the educational system should be turned over to children's authors like Dr Seuss. Publisher William Spaulding persuaded him to accept Hersey's challenge and the author set to work trying to come up with a story that used only 225 words.</p> <p>\"It was like trying to make a strudel without any strudels,\" Geisel later informed his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan. \"I was desperate, so I decided to read once more.

Now, Charlie's Angels has kicked Liu right onto the casting A-List. Born in New York to immigrant Chinese scientists, Liu, 31, fell into acting at university after she wound up being given the lead in Alice In Wonderland. But despite abandoning academia, Liu has hardly put her fierce intellect in limbo - as the following conversation makes clear. </p> <p><strong>How is this Charlie's Angels different from the 70s jiggle show it's based on? </strong><br> In many cases today, women face a lot of challenges just to balance career and love life and social life. It's different now because women are out there in the workforce, and there are so many single mothers out there, and a movie like this, as simple as it is, and as commercial as it is, and as fun as it is, it speaks miles about where we've come from and where we continue to go, and what we have achieved. It's a very simple film. It doesn't need to be prescribed as this or that, or put in a sort of pharmaceutical context. I think that if anything, it should show young girls that, first of all, no, you don't need to use guns to make a point, and also that you can do anything that you want. It's not like we went up there and were so intangible with our outfits or with our body types, or with our heights or our weights. We were very human, and I think that we showed heart in the movie with all the characters. </p> <p><strong>You've made a big show, with Drew and Cameron, of how close and sisterlike you all are. But there were rumours that the production was rife with fights and jealousy. </strong><br> I think that has a lot to do with, and it's unfortunate, a social foundation that we've all grown up with, which is that men who have never met can get along, sit in a room and watch a football game or whatever, and after they leave the room, they'll call each other, they'll hang out. But with women we've had that entire sort of soap opera mentality; God forbid a beautiful woman should acknowledge another woman as beautiful without having that be a jealousy situation. When we have a closed set people naturally believe that there's got to be something going on that's interesting and worth gossiping about. But it's an unfortunate statement about our society and the way we think. Fortunately for the three of us, and I'm not sure if it's because we all grew up as tomboys, we just don't think that way. </p> <p><strong>You were also reported to have had an intense falling out with Bill Murray. He's not talking; what do you want to say about him? </strong><br> People like Bill Murray have shaped my psyche, my sense of humour. Just to have him sitting next to me in the make-up chair was, like, making me quiver. It was just amazing. </p> <p><strong>And what about those who might complain that it's stereotypical for an Asian actress to be playing a martial arts heroine? </strong><br> People who have a very narrow sense of self and of culture would think that. But how come you can't turn it around and say, 'Wow, it's so refreshing to have an Asian-American be an Angel'? Why think the glass is half-empty? It's kind of miraculous, if you think about it. When was the last time you saw an Asian-American onscreen doing any of these things? And the other girls aren't Asian. How come they're given the allowance to do kung-fu and I have to be questioned on it? People who have that on their mind should think about that question and turn it back around - and get out of the Stone Age. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Sussex is the county which more than any other you don't have to be born in to love. When you meet people from Yorkshire or Essex, say, there's always this element of bitterness and blood-pull mingled with the real affection. But because Sussex is so soft, so sexy, it attracts many wanderers who adopt it as their own and then have all the nice feelings that come with belonging - security, pride; and none of the bad ones - smothering, resentment. Even though I am a West Country girl, I think of Sussex as being home, and quite tear up when I hear the song of my local football team, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: </p> <p> \"For we're the men from Sussex/ Sussex by the sea/ We plough and sow and reap or mow/And useful men are we./ And when you go to Sussex,/ Whoever you may be,/You may tell them all that we stand or fall/For Sussex by the sea!/ Oh Sussex, Sussex by the sea!/ Good old Sussex by the sea!\" </p> <p>Sussex, or more specifically my 'burg, East Sussex, is small (ish) and spectacular, with all this stuff going on at once - the rivers and beaches, the sea and the Downs and the cliffs - that it makes other counties look rather blowsy and barren. Occasionally, of course, it can have a bit too much water going on, as we learned recently when the Ouse and the Arun burst their banks as one, or when \"ancient springs\" were discovered under parts of Brighton, making it flood unprecedentedly. But, on the whole, it's heaven. </p> <p>Brighton, of course, is the sparkling star of the Sussex Coast, a magnet to slackers, runaways and pleasure-seekers ever since the Prince Regent first had his palace of ill-repute built here. \"Success smells of Brighton,\" said the Yorkshire-born Laurence Olivier, who moved here in the 1950s and, when he was enobled chose the title Lord Olivier of Brighton. But Brighton, in its indecent irrepressibility, is in many ways uncharacteristic of the south coast, where life is slow and stately and for good reason the chosen retirement roost of the elderly. Of a weekend, there is nothing my companion and I like more - well, OK, but only about five other things - than to jump in the jalopy, put on some Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra and tootle along the coast road in search of the sleeping small towns of East Sussex, some of which have amusingly obscene or scarily Gothic names - Climping and Fulking, Cold Christmas and Hurstpierpoint. </p> <p>Eastbourne is far from undiscovered, though. In the first part of the century, it was the swell of the south coast, watering hole of emperors and ballerinas, kings and coloraturas. Now, in the words of their most famous sons (since the late Russ Conway) Toploader, it is seen as \"the blue rinse capital of the world\". Indeed someone cruelly told me that \"it makes Hove look like Manumission\". </p> <p>I was initially attracted to it because of my hotel fetish; the 125-year-old, five-star Grand is simply the most magnificent beast in the whole of the south-east. But personally, I also love the tranquil, Morrissey-ish melancholia of English seaside resorts out of season: with their Winter Gardens and bandstands, tiny palm trees and carveries, they are among the few places where you can still imagine what the 1950s felt like, what a world without America would feel like. Eastbourne is strange and beautiful, like Scandinavia or the moon, with rather more to see and do. </p> <p>The Grand Hotel looms over Eastbourne as defiantly and definitively as the Statue of Liberty loomed over Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes; it reared up at us out of the night, ice-white and towering, like something out of St Petersburg. All by itself, set back from the road, scorning the neighbouring hotels whose names also recall the glory days of the English seaside - the Albany, the Burlington, the Chatsworth, the Cavendish - you could see why it was known as \"The White Palace\" in the years between the wars, when the BBC Palm Court Orchestra broadcast live from the Great Hall every Sunday night from 1924 to 1939. Dennis Potter, whose Cream In My Coffee was filmed there, called it \"a huge, creamy palace\". </p> <p>Opulent yet easeful, the utterly lush reception has greeted everyone from Winston Churchill, Haile Sellasie and Aneurin Bevan to Charlie Chaplin, Arthur Conan Doyle, Elgar, Anna Pavlova and Paul Robeson, These days it may be somewhat reduced to Harold Pinter, Celine Dion and Liam Gallagher, but you still get the essence of the place where Debussy completed La Mer. As far back as the 1880s, the Eastbourne Grand was, a byword for luxury and progress going hand-in-hand; advertisements boasted of the private omnibus to collect rail travellers, a library and public rooms lit with electric light, a hydraulic lift and separate tables in the dining room. The King of Spain was so impressed by the Grand's cabstand that he had an exact replica built in Madrid; from 1918 to 1952, the hotel was so popular that it had its own farm supplying guests with fruit, veg, eggs and poultry. </p> <p>Today the Grand's entirely justified pride in its own singularity can be seen in its huge, gorgeous outdoor and indoor swimming pools, among other things. As a bit of a swimming pool connoisseur, this is the first aspect of a hotel I pay attention to once the register has been signed and the luggage has been dumped, and I've come across some lulus in my time, even in five-star hotels. In Brighton, for instance, the modest Metropole has the loveliest indoor pool imaginable, while the jumped-up Grand next door has an alleged \"swimming\" pool that I can't see giving sufficient legroom to anyone when Snow White and the Seven Dwarves isn't playing at the Theatre Royal. </p> <p>But like all great hotels - The Imperial (Torquay), Reid's (Madeira), Pink Sands, (The Bahamas) - the real glory of this hotel is its staff, and what almost seems like the Indonesian wayang shadow ballet of preparation, interaction and performance. This can be seen at its most prancing level of perfection in the Grand's two dining rooms, the Garden Restaurant and the Mirabelle. On the first night, In the Garden Restaurant, I knocked back smoked salmon with quails eggs and Dover sole and thought how very sad it was that now the new Radio 2 is the official home of the Beautiful South and the even more beautiful Corrs, you have to find a restaurant with a pianist in order to hear those wonderful old songs for swinging lovers like Volare, Misty and Baubles, Bangles and Beads. </p> <p>On the second night in the Mirabelle - according to the Good Food Guide one of 20 best troughs in the British Isles, and I for one certainly wouldn't argue with them - I reflected that any restaurant that has the pianist playing The Shadow Of Your Smile as one sits down, could serve one rancid Pot Noodle and they'd still have my vote. But never one to look a gift horse in the kisser, I nevertheless accepted seared scallops on a cauliflower pur\u00e9e with a dressing of caper and grape, a ribeye of Scottish beef with a rich red wine jus and a selection of cheeses I loved so much that I wanted to put them on my Friends and Family phone list. My young friend grappled with a pressing of pork set in a star anise-infused jelly with a chutney of apple, a risotto of parmesan and thyme and a warm chocolate fondant with white chocolate ice-cream. The pianist played You'll Never Know and the staff performed the arrogant, yielding ballet of service. I felt so lit up, so glowing with pure protein that I could have served as an incandescent illustration for that poor mad old man who used to shoulder his heavy banner along Oxford Street, \"Protein = Lust\". My friend and I just looked at each other and laughed, it was so brilliant. </p> <p>The next morning we drove out to Beachy Head in a raging gale, bent on flagellating our swinish selves. Beachy Head is only about 15 minutes from Eastbourne and, with silver sea sneaking round on either side, it must be one of the most beautiful places in England in sunshine. But as we walked the Peace Path around the top of the cliff, all I could think about was all the poor suicides who'd pitched themselves off. I didn't much fancy following them and demanded we turn back, to which my boyfriend replied that we'd feel really righteous once we'd done it. With this, he turned the corner straight into a force-nine gale - the first time I've heard wind actually screaming - which he could barely stand-up in. He suggested that we turn back, and we staggered to the car to recover. It was without doubt the scariest moment of my life (apart from the first morning I woke up in the same bed as Tony Parsons), but it certainly got the adrenaline going. </p> <p>Be that as it may, I felt that I'd had enough of nature's wild grandeur, and demanded to be taken somewhere totally unnatural. Within 10 minutes, we were in one of the hugest covered malls I've ever seen - Eastbourne's Arndale Centre. A compromise was called for, so we drove down to the seafront to soak up the vibes. The pier is typically solid, boasting both a newsagent's and a flower shop which we certainly don't have on Brighton pier. Not suprisingly, the tattoo shop had closed down, but the charming Bar Copa at the end of the pier proclaimed itself to be the ideal spot \"for sporting and cavorting\". There were boat trips on offer, too: cruises round Beachy Head and speedboat rides on the thrillingly named 007. Once again, this was in pleasing contrast to Brighton - where it is easier to get raw opium than a boat-ride. </p> <p>The esplanade was pleasantly melancholic: a sign threatened a whopping \u00a3500 fine for cycling on the seafront and a yellowing poster promised The Manfreds with Chris Farlowe, Alan Price and Cliff Bennett (but sadly, no Rebel Rousers) at the Congress Theatre. Best of all, in a basement beneath the Cumberland Hotel, we were Invited to \"In-Step Sunday Club: Ballroom and Sequence Dancing with Peter Harvey's Hi-Fi Show\". It made me miss my mum and wish Alan Bennett was with me and I thought how very pleasant the old English way of taking one's pleasure was, without all that neurotic chasing about and taking pictures of everything, just so the folks back home will believe you were there. </p> <p>It was about 5pm on a Sunday afternoon, just getting dark, and then the most gorgeous thing happened. We went up the front steps of the Grand and into the lobby - and there, in the Great Hall right in front of us, was a string quartet playing chamber music. Smart old couples took tea at tiny tables, and as we went up in the lift, suddenly it could have been any year between 1924 and 1939. The immaculate Grand could have been the rundown Overlook from The Shining, full of between-the-war ghosts. </p> <p>The music followed us right up to our suite, then faded away. It was one of the strangest and most enchanting things I've ever experienced. Indeed, being in Eastbourne was in many ways stranger, more foreign than being abroad - particularly the Caribbean, which in its more profitable enclaves can feel like lodging in a luxury franchise of America. But you can occasionally find good parts of Britain - Porthmadoc in Wales is another - where the American takeover seems never to have happened. And never underestimate the refreshing qualities of sneaking off the Yankee yoke, if only for a weekend. </p> <p>After five years of feverish globetrotting in the course of my work, I can honestly say that, particularly this year, the holidays I took at home - in Torquay and Portmeirion - were far more enjoyable than my holidays in Jamaica and Corsica, very agreeable though these were too. I'm not sure what the definition of sophistication is, but I think a good part of it is the ability to derive as great a kick from humdrum pleasure as from exotic ones though, of course, it probably doesn't signify unless you've tried the exotic ones, too. Eastbourne isn't St Tropez, but I had a brilliant time there. And far from taking this as proof of my infirmity, I'd prefer to think that it merely shows that I am not yet some sad old sack who needs the warmth of the Med or the Caribbean to fire up my chilly English blood. </p> <p> Really, I'm the last person to refuse a bit of long-haul winter sun, but I do believe that (and this must, sadly, be the one recorded incidence in which my views tally with those of the Green lobby and the anti-suntan-bores) we often go much further than we need to in search of our rest, recreation and restoration when often a change of scene and someone else making the bed is all we need. I know people who routinely take 14-hour flights to faraway countries where - reeling from jetlag, inoculations and delays - they spend 10 days burning off their outer epidermis and 10 nights drinking cheap booze before taking another 14-hour flight home - where they'll complain they feel exhausted! Whereas I left Brighton on Friday night overworked and undersexed but, after three rainy nights in Eastbourne, came back feeling a new person. I hope you'll excuse the smutty gag, by the way - but I always find that there's nothing like an English seaside town, however genteel, for effortlessly doubling one's entendre. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br></p> <p> Julie Burchill stayed at The Grand Hotel, King Edwards Parade, Eastbourne East Sussex BN21 4EQ (tel: 01323 412345, <a href=\"http://www.grandeastbourne.com\">www.grandeastbourne.com</a>). </p> <p> The short-break rate (min two-night stay) starts at \u00a3195 a night for a deluxe bedroom based on two sharing and goes up to \u00a3450 a night for the presidential suite.

      "bodyText": "Sussex is the county which more than any other you don't have to be born in to love. When you meet people from Yorkshire or Essex, say, there's always this element of bitterness and blood-pull mingled with the real affection. But because Sussex is so soft, so sexy, it attracts many wanderers who adopt it as their own and then have all the nice feelings that come with belonging - security, pride; and none of the bad ones - smothering, resentment. Even though I am a West Country girl, I think of Sussex as being home, and quite tear up when I hear the song of my local football team, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: \"For we're the men from Sussex/ Sussex by the sea/ We plough and sow and reap or mow/And useful men are we./ And when you go to Sussex,/ Whoever you may be,/You may tell them all that we stand or fall/For Sussex by the sea!/ Oh Sussex, Sussex by the sea!/ Good old Sussex by the sea!\" Sussex, or more specifically my 'burg, East Sussex, is small (ish) and spectacular, with all this stuff going on at once - the rivers and beaches, the sea and the Downs and the cliffs - that it makes other counties look rather blowsy and barren. Occasionally, of course, it can have a bit too much water going on, as we learned recently when the Ouse and the Arun burst their banks as one, or when \"ancient springs\" were discovered under parts of Brighton, making it flood unprecedentedly. But, on the whole, it's heaven. Brighton, of course, is the sparkling star of the Sussex Coast, a magnet to slackers, runaways and pleasure-seekers ever since the Prince Regent first had his palace of ill-repute built here. \"Success smells of Brighton,\" said the Yorkshire-born Laurence Olivier, who moved here in the 1950s and, when he was enobled chose the title Lord Olivier of Brighton. But Brighton, in its indecent irrepressibility, is in many ways uncharacteristic of the south coast, where life is slow and stately and for good reason the chosen retirement roost of the elderly. Of a weekend, there is nothing my companion and I like more - well, OK, but only about five other things - than to jump in the jalopy, put on some Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra and tootle along the coast road in search of the sleeping small towns of East Sussex, some of which have amusingly obscene or scarily Gothic names - Climping and Fulking, Cold Christmas and Hurstpierpoint. Eastbourne is far from undiscovered, though. In the first part of the century, it was the swell of the south coast, watering hole of emperors and ballerinas, kings and coloraturas. Now, in the words of their most famous sons (since the late Russ Conway) Toploader, it is seen as \"the blue rinse capital of the world\". Indeed someone cruelly told me that \"it makes Hove look like Manumission\". I was initially attracted to it because of my hotel fetish; the 125-year-old, five-star Grand is simply the most magnificent beast in the whole of the south-east. But personally, I also love the tranquil, Morrissey-ish melancholia of English seaside resorts out of season: with their Winter Gardens and bandstands, tiny palm trees and carveries, they are among the few places where you can still imagine what the 1950s felt like, what a world without America would feel like. Eastbourne is strange and beautiful, like Scandinavia or the moon, with rather more to see and do. The Grand Hotel looms over Eastbourne as defiantly and definitively as the Statue of Liberty loomed over Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes; it reared up at us out of the night, ice-white and towering, like something out of St Petersburg. All by itself, set back from the road, scorning the neighbouring hotels whose names also recall the glory days of the English seaside - the Albany, the Burlington, the Chatsworth, the Cavendish - you could see why it was known as \"The White Palace\" in the years between the wars, when the BBC Palm Court Orchestra broadcast live from the Great Hall every Sunday night from 1924 to 1939. Dennis Potter, whose Cream In My Coffee was filmed there, called it \"a huge, creamy palace\". Opulent yet easeful, the utterly lush reception has greeted everyone from Winston Churchill, Haile Sellasie and Aneurin Bevan to Charlie Chaplin, Arthur Conan Doyle, Elgar, Anna Pavlova and Paul Robeson, These days it may be somewhat reduced to Harold Pinter, Celine Dion and Liam Gallagher, but you still get the essence of the place where Debussy completed La Mer. As far back as the 1880s, the Eastbourne Grand was, a byword for luxury and progress going hand-in-hand; advertisements boasted of the private omnibus to collect rail travellers, a library and public rooms lit with electric light, a hydraulic lift and separate tables in the dining room. The King of Spain was so impressed by the Grand's cabstand that he had an exact replica built in Madrid; from 1918 to 1952, the hotel was so popular that it had its own farm supplying guests with fruit, veg, eggs and poultry. Today the Grand's entirely justified pride in its own singularity can be seen in its huge, gorgeous outdoor and indoor swimming pools, among other things. As a bit of a swimming pool connoisseur, this is the first aspect of a hotel I pay attention to once the register has been signed and the luggage has been dumped, and I've come across some lulus in my time, even in five-star hotels.

      "body": "<p>Of course, one thing the sponsor William Hill cannot do in all propriety is run a book on its annual sports-lit award. For \"the Bookie prize\", the vote for the year's best sports book which is up for grabs again on Monday, you have to come up with your own set of odds for outsiders and favourite, although rumours suggest that from the shortlist of six the judges have taken a shine to Peak Performance, co-written by a Kiwi quartet of authors. </p> <p>Should the aptly named Peak Performance gallop into the winner's enclosure, it will - alas, although I suppose it is what a new book should do - reflect the age in which we live in and which sport increasingly inhabits. </p> <p>For sport counts the score these days in greenbacks. Peak Performance is an examination, and a gushingly over-enthusiastic one at that, of what makes the market forces of some of the world's most bankable sporting businesses - from the Atlanta Braves to yachting's Team New Zealand - tick. To heck with actually playing the game; this is narrow-eyed sport as product, as brand image, as designer label. </p> <p>If you are going to have a bet with a rival bookmaker, then for pedigree's sake go for the other \"political and economic\" nominee. </p> <p>Andrew Jennings's uncovering of the shocking frailties of the Olympic oligarchy is far more close-knuckled campaigning and journalistic, and his one-man crusade would be a worthier winner than the glossy business-brochure-in-hardback which is Peak Performance. And The Great Olympic Swindle is just as much a tome of our times. </p> <p>For persistent single-mindedness verging on paranoia, if nothing else, Jennings might well have won \"the Bookie\" with his snipe at Juan Antonio Samaranch in The Lords Of The Rings, which was shortlisted in 1992. But that was a seminal year for sports books, and the prize went to the debutant author Nick Hornby for Fever Pitch, the autobiographical medical-notes of an Arsenal supporter which gloriously, even scarily, anatomised and picked over the obsessive pathology of the fan. Sportswriting - and the less precise writing-about-sport - could never, we were told, be the same after young Hornby had taken up his pen and written: </p> <p>\"Chapter One. I fell in love with football as I was later to fall in love with women: suddenly, inexplicably, uncritically, giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring with it. In May '68 (a date with connotations, of course, but I am still more likely to think of Jeff Astle than of Paris) ...\" </p> <p>Hornby's tour de force not only touched a nerve which had been waiting to be vitalised but was the inspiration for the first generation in British football to \"come out\", as it were, about their passion for the game. Suddenly it was not only OK but almost compulsory for every city's \"top-end Hampstead\" intellectuals to gather round dinner tables and talk with rapt studiousness, not about Pinter or Amis or Truffaut, but Robson and Seaman and Gazza. </p> <p>The year after Fever Pitch won, the London Review of Books even had a huge portrait of young Gascoigne on its front cover. Inside, without a bat of the eyelid from the magazine editor Karl Miller, it described the tubby midfielder as a \"priapic monolith\" - and, in passing, a \"dive\" by J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was ranked a \"piece of German theatre that could have earned him a place in Goethe's Walpurgisnacht\". </p> <p>The 1992 William Hill winner untapped a whole new liturgy for the literati and let men's feelings out of the closet in much the same way as the militantly feminist books had a couple of decades before. Fever Pitch also spawned whole shelves of copycat supporters' tracts. </p> <p>Mercifully, there are no post-Hornby howlers on this year's excellent shortlist - although I would have liked to see David Downing's brilliant history of the Moscow Dynamos' 1945 visit to England (Passovotchka, Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) elbow itself in, as well as one of the University of Wales Press's two series of fine rugby and soccer essays (respectively More Heart And Soul and For Club And Country, each \u00a314.99). </p> <p>And, for necessary light relief in the mixed-up game of rugby union, it would have been good to have had Martin Johnson (not the shop steward of Twickenham but the pin-sharp and unputdownable breezy journalist) and his Rugby And All That, An Irreverent History (Hodder, \u00a314.99) barging his way in. It is the most congenial rugby book since 1960 and Michael Green's Art Of Coarse Rugby which, in its different way, was almost as seminal for sports-book publishing as Fever Pitch more than three decades later. </p> <p>Me, I am putting my money on the cricket book, the compelling story of Jack Iverson, whose unique spinning technique - middle finger compressed behind the ball on delivery - we all tried to copy at school. Or, in my case, until I painfully dislocated the bottom knuckle and matron had to take me to outpatients. </p> <p>What might dissuade the judges against Gideon Haigh's terrific book - Australia's finest cricket writer, by the by, should have been shortlisted in 1998 for his near-perfect The Summer Game - is that two of the last three winners, Derek Birley and Simon Hughes, have been for cricket. Which is also the reason, probably, that David Underdown's scholarly early history of the game (Start Of Play, Penguin, \u00a320) grievously gets no mention this year. </p> <p>The competition's co-sponsor, as it ever has been, is Sportspages, the irreplaceable London and Manchester bookshop. Permanent chairman of the judges (Cliff Morgan, Ian Wooldridge, Frances Edmonds, John Inverdale and Danny Kelly) is Sportspages' founder John Gaustad. And each year the competition, in a way, also doubles as a chance to raise a toast in gratitude to us book buyers and browsers who came tumbling out of the closet and into our addicts' den when young Gaustad bravely opened his treasure-trove doors in September 1985. </p> <p>A bookshop exclusive to sport? No hope, the business world scoffed. On his first day he opened at 9am and a customer did not approach the counter until 3.20pm. He bought a copy of A Concise Light On Yoga, and Gaustad was up and running. Now Sportspages is a worldwide club and meeting place for the freemasonry; even Yanks take vacations to pore in wonder over its baseball shelves. </p> <p>Before Sportspages there was only WH Smith, where you could go tremulously in any spring and ask, \"Do you stock Wisden?\" And a slip of a gormless girl would look up from painting her nails and stare back blankly: \"Is that Norman Wisdom then?\"</p>",

For \"the Bookie prize\", the vote for the year's best sports book which is up for grabs again on Monday, you have to come up with your own set of odds for outsiders and favourite, although rumours suggest that from the shortlist of six the judges have taken a shine to Peak Performance, co-written by a Kiwi quartet of authors. Should the aptly named Peak Performance gallop into the winner's enclosure, it will - alas, although I suppose it is what a new book should do - reflect the age in which we live in and which sport increasingly inhabits. For sport counts the score these days in greenbacks. Peak Performance is an examination, and a gushingly over-enthusiastic one at that, of what makes the market forces of some of the world's most bankable sporting businesses - from the Atlanta Braves to yachting's Team New Zealand - tick. To heck with actually playing the game; this is narrow-eyed sport as product, as brand image, as designer label. If you are going to have a bet with a rival bookmaker, then for pedigree's sake go for the other \"political and economic\" nominee. Andrew Jennings's uncovering of the shocking frailties of the Olympic oligarchy is far more close-knuckled campaigning and journalistic, and his one-man crusade would be a worthier winner than the glossy business-brochure-in-hardback which is Peak Performance. And The Great Olympic Swindle is just as much a tome of our times. For persistent single-mindedness verging on paranoia, if nothing else, Jennings might well have won \"the Bookie\" with his snipe at Juan Antonio Samaranch in The Lords Of The Rings, which was shortlisted in 1992. But that was a seminal year for sports books, and the prize went to the debutant author Nick Hornby for Fever Pitch, the autobiographical medical-notes of an Arsenal supporter which gloriously, even scarily, anatomised and picked over the obsessive pathology of the fan. Sportswriting - and the less precise writing-about-sport - could never, we were told, be the same after young Hornby had taken up his pen and written: \"Chapter One. I fell in love with football as I was later to fall in love with women: suddenly, inexplicably, uncritically, giving no thought to the pain or disruption it would bring with it. In May '68 (a date with connotations, of course, but I am still more likely to think of Jeff Astle than of Paris) ...\" Hornby's tour de force not only touched a nerve which had been waiting to be vitalised but was the inspiration for the first generation in British football to \"come out\", as it were, about their passion for the game. Suddenly it was not only OK but almost compulsory for every city's \"top-end Hampstead\" intellectuals to gather round dinner tables and talk with rapt studiousness, not about Pinter or Amis or Truffaut, but Robson and Seaman and Gazza. The year after Fever Pitch won, the London Review of Books even had a huge portrait of young Gascoigne on its front cover. Inside, without a bat of the eyelid from the magazine editor Karl Miller, it described the tubby midfielder as a \"priapic monolith\" - and, in passing, a \"dive\" by J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was ranked a \"piece of German theatre that could have earned him a place in Goethe's Walpurgisnacht\". The 1992 William Hill winner untapped a whole new liturgy for the literati and let men's feelings out of the closet in much the same way as the militantly feminist books had a couple of decades before. Fever Pitch also spawned whole shelves of copycat supporters' tracts. Mercifully, there are no post-Hornby howlers on this year's excellent shortlist - although I would have liked to see David Downing's brilliant history of the Moscow Dynamos' 1945 visit to England (Passovotchka, Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) elbow itself in, as well as one of the University of Wales Press's two series of fine rugby and soccer essays (respectively More Heart And Soul and For Club And Country, each \u00a314.99). And, for necessary light relief in the mixed-up game of rugby union, it would have been good to have had Martin Johnson (not the shop steward of Twickenham but the pin-sharp and unputdownable breezy journalist) and his Rugby And All That, An Irreverent History (Hodder, \u00a314.99) barging his way in. It is the most congenial rugby book since 1960 and Michael Green's Art Of Coarse Rugby which, in its different way, was almost as seminal for sports-book publishing as Fever Pitch more than three decades later. Me, I am putting my money on the cricket book, the compelling story of Jack Iverson, whose unique spinning technique - middle finger compressed behind the ball on delivery - we all tried to copy at school. Or, in my case, until I painfully dislocated the bottom knuckle and matron had to take me to outpatients. What might dissuade the judges against Gideon Haigh's terrific book - Australia's finest cricket writer, by the by, should have been shortlisted in 1998 for his near-perfect The Summer Game - is that two of the last three winners, Derek Birley and Simon Hughes, have been for cricket. Which is also the reason, probably, that David Underdown's scholarly early history of the game (Start Of Play, Penguin, \u00a320) grievously gets no mention this year. The competition's co-sponsor, as it ever has been, is Sportspages, the irreplaceable London and Manchester bookshop. Permanent chairman of the judges (Cliff Morgan, Ian Wooldridge, Frances Edmonds, John Inverdale and Danny Kelly) is Sportspages' founder John Gaustad. And each year the competition, in a way, also doubles as a chance to raise a toast in gratitude to us book buyers and browsers who came tumbling out of the closet and into our addicts' den when young Gaustad bravely opened his treasure-trove doors in September 1985. A bookshop exclusive to sport? No hope, the business world scoffed. On his first day he opened at 9am and a customer did not approach the counter until 3.20pm. He bought a copy of A Concise Light On Yoga, and Gaustad was up and running. Now Sportspages is a worldwide club and meeting place for the freemasonry; even Yanks take vacations to pore in wonder over its baseball shelves. Before Sportspages there was only WH Smith, where you could go tremulously in any spring and ask, \"Do you stock Wisden?\" And a slip of a gormless girl would look up from painting her nails and stare back blankly: \"Is that Norman Wisdom then?\"",

      "body": "<p>Shopping is hardly war reporting, you might think, but then you have never had to brave the accusing stares of the staff in American Girl Place, a temple to the doll just off swish North Michigan Avenue. The store was filled with perfectly dressed moms, their divine, doll-coveting daughters, and slovenly me, trying (unsuccessfully, I would guess) not to look shifty. It has its own theatre, which stages The American Girls Revue (tickets $25), and a restaurant where dolls will join you at the table. The American Girl doll comes in 20 variants - different hair, skin and eye colour - and retails at $84. Outside, a little girl whose mother was clutching two new dolls was wailing. Wrong colour eyes maybe. </p> <p>North Michigan Avenue, aka the Magnificent Mile, has just about every store even a screeching American girl could ever want: the world's largest Polo Ralph Lauren, the world's largest Gap, Niketown, three vertical malls, and an array of designer stores - Armani, Bulgari, Cartier, Chanel, Tiffany. It also has what is claimed to be the world's best popcorn store, Garrett's, and has people queueing round the block to prove it. </p> <p>Chicago, which has been booming over the past decade, takes shopping very seriously, and sees it as a trump card in its battle with New York to win UK short-break visitors, especially in the run-up to Christmas. Hotels in Chicago are cheaper, the stores are less spread out, and the city is reckoned to be more \"user-friendly\". (The latter is, of course, a question of taste: New York's warm blanket of collective neurosis can be deeply comforting.) </p> <p>Chicago, which hugs the south-western shore of Lake Michigan, is certainly beautiful - and possibly the cleanest city I have ever visited. Mayor Richard M Daley, son of the legendary Richard J who ran Chicago from 1955-76, has a policy of \"beautification\", which seems to include showing zero tolerance towards litterers. The buildings gleam, the streets are broad and traffic-free, the parks are perfect, and the locals talk with horror of rat infestation in New York. </p> <p>The city has been reborn over the past 20 years. \"The streets are now safe and people are having a good time. I've seen Chicago become number one,\" a taxi driver told me. It's a long way from the city of John Dillinger, Al Capone and the St Valentine's Day Massacre, though this is a WASP-ish weekend break and it is a different story on the South Side. </p> <p>Shopping - you remember my mission - isn't confined to North Michigan Avenue. The downtown area, which is the business heart of the city, has several long-established department stores, including Marshall Field's, a turn-of-the-century landmark which was the model for Selfridge's. </p> <p>Marshall Field's is the Vatican City of shopping. It is the second largest department store in the world after Macy's in New York (bleak words for any Chicagoan to hear) and is anxious to preserve its aesthetic appeal. It has a remarkable 14-storey lightwell, a walnut-panelled restaurant and a blue-tiled dome that would not be out of place in a mosque. At Marshall Field's, you can shop and sightsee at the same time: the clock outside the store has been the city's traditional meeting place for more than 100 years. The store, like many others in Chicago, offers a 10% discount to foreign visitors. </p> <p>Downtown is very quiet on Saturday - in contrast to the crowds on North Michigan Avenue - and the atmosphere of hushed reverence in Marshall Field's seems entirely appropriate for this cathedral of commerce. Outside the store, on North State Street, in place of the designer shoppers of the Magnificent Mile, there are beggars and evangelists, including one representing the High Way Church of God in Christ: \"Let us not touch, taste or handle unclean things, such as tobacco, snuff, alcohol and drugs. My friend, once Christ frees you from these habits, be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Don't be a slave to one little thing.\" Except maybe shopping. </p> <p>Christmas is a big deal in Chicago, though commercialism can sometimes overwhelm sentiment: this year's lights procession, marking the official beginning of seasonal insanity, was led by Mickey Mouse and Co, Santa having been given the sack. If you want the full-on Christmas experience, Chicago will provide it, but to get the price right (especially at a time when the pound is weak against the dollar), timing is everything. Flight prices soar to \u00a3550-plus after December 17 as the Christmas stampede gathers pace, and many hotels will stick on a $100-a-night supplement, too, so the first and second weeks of the month are likely to be best. I paid $169 a night for a double room at the Regal Knickerbocker just off North Michigan Avenue and close to the lake. A single would cost $149, but beware those Christmas supplements. </p> <p>There is an excellent visitor centre in the old water tower on the Mag Mile (one of the few buildings to survive the great fire of 1871). It's the place to start for a stay in Chicago: bang in the centre of the touristic part of town, tons of literature, knowledgeable staff, half-price theatre tickets, and pretty good coffee. </p> <p>There is plenty to do culturally in Chicago, too. I spent an afternoon at the Art Institute (entrance $8), which is about eight museums in one - painting, sculpture, photography, furniture, armour, Buddhist artefacts, even an exhibition on skyscrapers, which gamely accepts that the Sears Building is now only the second tallest building in the world after the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur (this is a matter of dispute because each is constantly adding radio masts to up the ante). </p> <p>Chicago has three of the world's top 10 tall buildings, with the Amoco Building and the John Hancock Center joining the Sears Building in the big league. You can have a drink or lunch at the top of the 100-storey Hancock Center: great views of the city and lake, but very busy and around $40 (plus drinks) for a three-course meal. The lift does the 100 storeys in about a second, and you hardly notice it. </p> <p>You can't come to Chicago and not hear some jazz and blues. Jazz Showcase is reckoned to be the best venue: entrance is $20 and it is open every night, including Sundays when a lot of venues are closed. I caught a cerebral set (as we jazzers like to say) by a Panamanian quintet: full of meandering 15-minute numbers that were rapturously received by an earnest-looking audience. I sipped my Sam Adams and looked intense. </p> <p>Just across from Jazz Showcase on North Clark Street is one of Blue Chicago's two venues (entrance $6), which proved a good deal less earnest. It bothered me slightly that a large part of the audience was Japanese and drinking mineral water, but it was still a fun, traditional blues set, if mildly parodic - a gnarled, grey-haired man singing about life in jail and a vast, don't-mess-with-me woman whose husband had done her wrong (or had she done her husband wrong? - who knows, I wasn't drinking mineral water). </p> <p>There is also great theatre in Chicago - allegedly, because my time was short. Big, old theatres downtown and the trendy, smaller theatre groups such as Steppenwolf that shot to prominence in the 70s to the north of the city centre in buzzing Wrigleyville (so named after the Chicago Cubs' baseball field). The Vagina Monologues at the Apollo Theater was the hot ticket while I was there - a discourse on the pleasures of shopping, I am reliably informed.

      "body": "<p>The view of Mont Blanc is breathtaking as we get out of the small cable car at the top of Chamonix's Aiguille du Midi. Normally, it's a bun fight to reach the \"arret\", a narrow ridge that starts the 23km Vall\u00e9e Blanche descent. For us, it's uncrowded because it's a Saturday - change-over time for most tour operators, but the first day of our ski weekend. </p> <p>Catching the last Swissair flight from London on Friday night meant we were in Chamonix before midnight French time with three full days of skiing ahead of us. </p> <p>It's still not cheap because most weekend specialists use scheduled airlines, which cost more than charters, and accommodation for three or four nights often costs the same as it would for a week. But according to two of Britain's top weekend operators, Ski Weekend and FlexiSki, the weekenders are here to stay. </p> <p>To get the most out of your weekend, you need to choose resorts within easy reach of the airport: Verbier and Villars in Switzerland, Chamonix and Meg\u00e8ve in France and Courmayeur in Italy are all within 1\u20ac hours of Geneva; Lech and St Anton in Austria are 2\u20ac hours from Zurich. </p> <p>Weekend specialists have got the details down to a fine art. You don't want to waste time renting skis or getting a lift pass on that precious first day. And unless you book well in advance, it's virtually impossible without paying a premium to get the last flight out of Heathrow on a Friday night plus the Sunday night return from Geneva. It's worth leaving all that to the experts. </p> <p>Tour operators are also getting into the short-break skiing market. Airtours even offers day trips to Chamonix, Courchevel and Kitzb\u00fchel from Gatwick or Manchester. For this, you need stamina. With a 4.30am start, you can get a good five to six hours skiing in Chamonix if all goes well, but don't expect to be at your best the next day. </p> <p><strong>Courmayeur</strong><br> This resort on the sunny Italian side of the Mont Blanc tunnel (closed for the second season by a fire) has an abundance of charm and attracts the weekending Milanese. The village is old with cobble-stoned alleys and delightful small hotels and pensions. There is an extensive choice of bars and restaurants - from pizza to 12-course menus. </p> <p>Italians do not race for the first lifts, so if you are an early riser you will have the slopes to yourself. Hard to resist are the numerous traditional wooden huts turned into cosy mountain restaurants. Don't miss the Christiania at Plan Checrouit or La Grolla at Val Veny. </p> <p>The resort skiing is mostly intermediate. For more advanced skiers, the top of the two-stage cable car at Cresta d'Arp is the start of two great off-piste runs, but guides are recommended for this. Another cable car takes you to the Punta Helbronner, the start of the Italian Vall\u00e9e Blanche leading to Chamonix. But the closure of the tunnel has made the return journey unfeasibly long. Instead, there is a 10km run down the Toula Glacier to La Palud. </p> <p> <strong> Momentum Travel</strong> 020-7371 9111 <br><a href=\"http://www.momentum.uk.com\">www.momentum.uk.com</a> <br>Three nights in a pension with Ryanair flights, Stansted-Turin, and car hire starts at \u00a3229pp based on two people sharing a double room (\u00a3299 for a three-star hotel). </p> <p><strong>Chamonix</strong> <br> The first choice for any passionate skier, Chamonix lives up to its reputation. Over the years, it has been the start for many first ascents both in climbing and extreme skiing and is the home of one of the most respected guiding bodies, the Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix. </p> <p>Serious skiers head to Argenti\u00e8re and the Grands Montets, but the Chamonix valley caters to all levels. Les Houches and Le Tour are the easiest. Le Brevant and La Fl\u00e9g\u00e8re, recently linked, provide variety for beginners and intermediates and some excellent off-piste skiing. On a sunny day, the Vall\u00e9e Blanche glacier in the shadow of Mont Blanc is a magical run. It's not difficult, and the scenery is breathtaking. </p> <p>Chamonix is quite a large town with a wide variety of restaurants and nightlife. The smaller village of Argenti\u00e8re also offers several choices. </p> <p> <strong> Collineige</strong> 01276 24262 <br><a href=\"http://www.collineige.com\">www.collineige.com</a> <br>Now in its 21st year, the Chamonix specialist has a selection of four-night weekends in several chalets. Breakfast, tea and three-course dinners with wine start at \u00a3595. Off piste or skiing with a guide can be arranged. Price includes scheduled flights and private transfer. </p> <p><strong> Ski Weekend</strong> 01367 241636 <br><a href=\"http://www.skiweekend.com\">www.skiweekend.com</a> <br>Three-day weekends in a two-star hotel start from \u00a3389 B&amp;B (\u00a3419 half board) including return scheduled flights on Swissair or Crossair, transfer, ski orientation and services of a resort co-ordinator. Ski passes cost \u00a320 per day. Four days' off-piste skiing with guide Yves Detry start at \u00a3599 including flights, transfer and two-star accommodation. </p> <p><strong>Verbier</strong> <br>To make the most of Verbier, you will need stamina. Not just for its glaciers, couloirs, moguls and powder but also for its legendary nightlife. Those who brave Fergie's old haunt, the Farm Club, rarely leave before 3am after inflicting some serious damage to both heads and wallets. </p> <p>Verbier is not for beginners, but intermediates and boarders will find more than enough to keep them busy at Savoleyres and Lac des Vaux. The Four Valley lift pass is a linked network of 96 lifts covering 400km of piste. </p> <p>For advanced and expert skiers, the skiing is unlimited from Tortin, a steep and wide slope pounded into knee-high moguls, to the front face of Mont Gel\u00e9. From the top of the Mont Fort cable car, you can pick your route from red to black or some good off-piste off the back. On a powder day, you'll need to catch the first cable car or you will find that famous runs such as Stairway to Heaven and the Hidden Valley are skied out. </p> <p>Despite its upmarket reputation, Verbier does not boast gourmet restaurants on the mountain. On Savoleyres, the most authentic place is Buvette de la Marenaz, but it's off-piste to get there. For something simple, try the station caf\u00e9 at Le Chble. In town, head to hangouts such as Offshore and the Pub at Mont Fort. </p> <p> <strong> FlexiSki</strong> 0870 9090 754<br><a href=\"http://www.flexiski.co.uk\">www.flexiski.co.uk</a> <br>Now owned by First Choice, the former small independent will tailor-make any weekend.

      "bodyText": "The view of Mont Blanc is breathtaking as we get out of the small cable car at the top of Chamonix's Aiguille du Midi. Normally, it's a bun fight to reach the \"arret\", a narrow ridge that starts the 23km Vall\u00e9e Blanche descent. For us, it's uncrowded because it's a Saturday - change-over time for most tour operators, but the first day of our ski weekend. Catching the last Swissair flight from London on Friday night meant we were in Chamonix before midnight French time with three full days of skiing ahead of us. It's still not cheap because most weekend specialists use scheduled airlines, which cost more than charters, and accommodation for three or four nights often costs the same as it would for a week. But according to two of Britain's top weekend operators, Ski Weekend and FlexiSki, the weekenders are here to stay. To get the most out of your weekend, you need to choose resorts within easy reach of the airport: Verbier and Villars in Switzerland, Chamonix and Meg\u00e8ve in France and Courmayeur in Italy are all within 1\u20ac hours of Geneva; Lech and St Anton in Austria are 2\u20ac hours from Zurich. Weekend specialists have got the details down to a fine art. You don't want to waste time renting skis or getting a lift pass on that precious first day. And unless you book well in advance, it's virtually impossible without paying a premium to get the last flight out of Heathrow on a Friday night plus the Sunday night return from Geneva. It's worth leaving all that to the experts. Tour operators are also getting into the short-break skiing market. Airtours even offers day trips to Chamonix, Courchevel and Kitzb\u00fchel from Gatwick or Manchester. For this, you need stamina. With a 4.30am start, you can get a good five to six hours skiing in Chamonix if all goes well, but don't expect to be at your best the next day. Courmayeur This resort on the sunny Italian side of the Mont Blanc tunnel (closed for the second season by a fire) has an abundance of charm and attracts the weekending Milanese. The village is old with cobble-stoned alleys and delightful small hotels and pensions. There is an extensive choice of bars and restaurants - from pizza to 12-course menus. Italians do not race for the first lifts, so if you are an early riser you will have the slopes to yourself. Hard to resist are the numerous traditional wooden huts turned into cosy mountain restaurants. Don't miss the Christiania at Plan Checrouit or La Grolla at Val Veny. The resort skiing is mostly intermediate. For more advanced skiers, the top of the two-stage cable car at Cresta d'Arp is the start of two great off-piste runs, but guides are recommended for this. Another cable car takes you to the Punta Helbronner, the start of the Italian Vall\u00e9e Blanche leading to Chamonix. But the closure of the tunnel has made the return journey unfeasibly long. Instead, there is a 10km run down the Toula Glacier to La Palud. Momentum Travel 020-7371 9111 www.momentum.uk.com Three nights in a pension with Ryanair flights, Stansted-Turin, and car hire starts at \u00a3229pp based on two people sharing a double room (\u00a3299 for a three-star hotel). Chamonix The first choice for any passionate skier, Chamonix lives up to its reputation. Over the years, it has been the start for many first ascents both in climbing and extreme skiing and is the home of one of the most respected guiding bodies, the Compagnie des Guides de Chamonix. Serious skiers head to Argenti\u00e8re and the Grands Montets, but the Chamonix valley caters to all levels. Les Houches and Le Tour are the easiest. Le Brevant and La Fl\u00e9g\u00e8re, recently linked, provide variety for beginners and intermediates and some excellent off-piste skiing. On a sunny day, the Vall\u00e9e Blanche glacier in the shadow of Mont Blanc is a magical run. It's not difficult, and the scenery is breathtaking. Chamonix is quite a large town with a wide variety of restaurants and nightlife. The smaller village of Argenti\u00e8re also offers several choices. Collineige 01276 24262 www.collineige.com Now in its 21st year, the Chamonix specialist has a selection of four-night weekends in several chalets. Breakfast, tea and three-course dinners with wine start at \u00a3595. Off piste or skiing with a guide can be arranged. Price includes scheduled flights and private transfer. Ski Weekend 01367 241636 www.skiweekend.com Three-day weekends in a two-star hotel start from \u00a3389 B&amp;B (\u00a3419 half board) including return scheduled flights on Swissair or Crossair, transfer, ski orientation and services of a resort co-ordinator. Ski passes cost \u00a320 per day. Four days' off-piste skiing with guide Yves Detry start at \u00a3599 including flights, transfer and two-star accommodation. Verbier To make the most of Verbier, you will need stamina. Not just for its glaciers, couloirs, moguls and powder but also for its legendary nightlife. Those who brave Fergie's old haunt, the Farm Club, rarely leave before 3am after inflicting some serious damage to both heads and wallets. Verbier is not for beginners, but intermediates and boarders will find more than enough to keep them busy at Savoleyres and Lac des Vaux. The Four Valley lift pass is a linked network of 96 lifts covering 400km of piste. For advanced and expert skiers, the skiing is unlimited from Tortin, a steep and wide slope pounded into knee-high moguls, to the front face of Mont Gel\u00e9. From the top of the Mont Fort cable car, you can pick your route from red to black or some good off-piste off the back. On a powder day, you'll need to catch the first cable car or you will find that famous runs such as Stairway to Heaven and the Hidden Valley are skied out. Despite its upmarket reputation, Verbier does not boast gourmet restaurants on the mountain. On Savoleyres, the most authentic place is Buvette de la Marenaz, but it's off-piste to get there. For something simple, try the station caf\u00e9 at Le Chble. In town, head to hangouts such as Offshore and the Pub at Mont Fort. FlexiSki 0870 9090 754 www.flexiski.co.uk Now owned by First Choice, the former small independent will tailor-make any weekend. Prices for four-nights start at \u00a3445, including scheduled flights, transfers and half-board accommodation in the luxury Chalet Bouvreuil. Inghams 020-8780 4444 www.inghams.co.uk Short ski breaks of two nights or more are available to most of its Swiss ski resorts. Travel is by scheduled airlines on any day of the week, with transfers by rail. Prices start from \u00a3285 for two nights' half board at the Hotel Edelweiss in M\u00fcrren. Short-break hotels include the four-star Sunstar Park in Arosa from \u00a3359 and the five-star Grand Hotel Regina in Grindelwald start from \u00a3411. Airtours 0870 157 7775 www.airtours.co.uk Two-nightski weekends departing on Friday morning to Zell am See in Austria and returning Sunday night cost \u00a3319 including flights, transfer and half-board accommodation. Two-night weekends to Courchevel start at \u00a3329. Day trips from Manchester and Gatwick to Chamonix cost \u00a3179 and from Gatwick to Kitzb\u00fchel \u00a3189.

      "body": "<p>Remortgaging has reached record levels as growing numbers of people become aware of the savings they can make by moving their mortgage to another lender. </p> <p>Official figures out this week show that last month, for the first time ever, remortgages accounted for a third of all the home loans granted - in October 1999 they made up less than a quarter of the total. </p> <p>The surge in interest in switching your home loan partly reflects the competition in the mortgage market, which has resulted in a plethora of attractive deals. </p> <p>Experts say it also reflects the fact that people are now more savvy when it comes to products such as mortgages. The internet has contributed to this, putting borrowers in the driving seat by letting them browse the various offers on the market. </p> <p>Below we look at some of the best deals around for those looking to remortgage. </p> <p>There can be huge sums at stake. Ray Boulger at mortgage broker Charcol says many people can easily slice a quarter off their mortgage payments by switching, up to \u00a3100 or even \u00a3200 a month. </p> <p>While the typical bank standard variable rate is 7.74%, there are two and three-year fixed rate and discounted deals available as low as 5.24%. </p> <p>The message has to be that if you're sitting on your lender's standard variable rate, and there are no lock-in redemption penalties tying you in, you are simply throwing money away. </p> <p>Your options are to talk to your lender to see if they will do you a better deal, or walk away and take another lender's deal. If you've been a good customer, your lender won't want to lose you, so get on the phone to them. </p> <p>The cut throat competition means some lenders are pro-actively talking to their customers about better deals. Halifax is currently writing to 200,000 existing borrowers a month offering them the chance to move to other deals such as tracker loans (where the rate you pay follows the ups and downs of the Bank of England base rate) or fixed rates. </p> <p>You might want to check out the deals on offer by surfing the net or scanning the Jobs &amp; Money best buys before you talk to your lender. </p> <p>If they can't come up with anything attractive, think seriously about taking your custom elsewhere. Many people perceive that a mortgage transfer is a huge, costly hassle. In truth, it does take a bit of sorting out, and you will probably have to dig out documents and fill in some forms. Many lenders are so desperate for your custom that they will pay your legal costs, waive the arrangement fee and throw in a free valuation as well. </p> <p>If you are locked in to your current loan by early redemption penalties, it's not quite so simple. You will need to make sure that paying the penalty and going elsewhere will cost you less than staying on your current rate. One estimate is that only about 25% of people who do have redemption penalties would enjoy sufficient savings by remortgaging to make it worthwhile paying the penalty and moving. </p> <p>So what good remortgage deals are on offer? Charcol says that Coventry Building Society is offering some competitive remortgage deals only available via its website, <a href=\"http://www.remortgages.co.uk.\">www.remortgages.co.uk</a> for those happy to arrange their mortgage over the net. </p> <p>They include a fee-free fixed rate where what you pay is pegged at 5.39% until February 28, 2003, and a fee-free discounted rate giving 2.35% off the standard rate until the same date (initial payment rate: 5.35%). Neither has early redemption penalties at any time. </p> <p>Charcol is offering its own almost fee-free remortgage where you get a 2% discount off the 7.75% standard variable rate in the first year (giving a current payment rate of 5.75%), a 1.85% discount in the second year, and 1.7% off in the third year. The deal is funded by the Woolwich and is flexible. </p> <p>While there are redemp tion penalties within the first three years, you are allowed to pay back up to 25% of the mortgage each year without penalty. There's a \u00a349 booking fee. </p> <p>Bath-based broker London &amp; Country Mortgages highlights several deals. </p> <p>On the fee-free front, Halifax is offering a tracker deal giving 0.45% off the bank base rate for two years, which means a current pay rate of 5.55%. The deal is completely free of redemption penalties. </p> <p>Halifax also has a deal fixed at 5.65% until February 28, 2003. With this, there is a \u00a3195 arrangement fee and redemption penalties only within the period. Both loans require a deposit of 25%-plus. </p> <p>Britannia Building Society has a deal giving 2.4% off the standard rate for two years, giving a current payment rate of 5.24%. There is a \u00a3195 arrangement fee, there are no redemption penalties at all, and a deposit of at least 25% is required. </p> <p>Northern Rock is offering a loan fixed at 5.39% until January 1, 2003 but there is a \u00a3495 fee to pay.

      "bodyText": "Remortgaging has reached record levels as growing numbers of people become aware of the savings they can make by moving their mortgage to another lender. Official figures out this week show that last month, for the first time ever, remortgages accounted for a third of all the home loans granted - in October 1999 they made up less than a quarter of the total. The surge in interest in switching your home loan partly reflects the competition in the mortgage market, which has resulted in a plethora of attractive deals. Experts say it also reflects the fact that people are now more savvy when it comes to products such as mortgages. The internet has contributed to this, putting borrowers in the driving seat by letting them browse the various offers on the market. Below we look at some of the best deals around for those looking to remortgage. There can be huge sums at stake. Ray Boulger at mortgage broker Charcol says many people can easily slice a quarter off their mortgage payments by switching, up to \u00a3100 or even \u00a3200 a month. While the typical bank standard variable rate is 7.74%, there are two and three-year fixed rate and discounted deals available as low as 5.24%. The message has to be that if you're sitting on your lender's standard variable rate, and there are no lock-in redemption penalties tying you in, you are simply throwing money away. Your options are to talk to your lender to see if they will do you a better deal, or walk away and take another lender's deal. If you've been a good customer, your lender won't want to lose you, so get on the phone to them. The cut throat competition means some lenders are pro-actively talking to their customers about better deals. Halifax is currently writing to 200,000 existing borrowers a month offering them the chance to move to other deals such as tracker loans (where the rate you pay follows the ups and downs of the Bank of England base rate) or fixed rates. You might want to check out the deals on offer by surfing the net or scanning the Jobs &amp; Money best buys before you talk to your lender. If they can't come up with anything attractive, think seriously about taking your custom elsewhere. Many people perceive that a mortgage transfer is a huge, costly hassle. In truth, it does take a bit of sorting out, and you will probably have to dig out documents and fill in some forms. Many lenders are so desperate for your custom that they will pay your legal costs, waive the arrangement fee and throw in a free valuation as well. If you are locked in to your current loan by early redemption penalties, it's not quite so simple.

Anyway, I had suggested that he direct me to a classic restaurant of the city, and he did just that. </p> <p>Unless you knew about it, you could easily pass by the Ristorante Tre Galline without a second glance.

You don't go to Tre Galline for cucina nuova or the grilled-vegetable-grilled-meat pastiches of Italian food with which we in England are now all too familiar.

And so on and so on, with the daily regular specials - arrosti misti al carrello (mixed roast meats) on Monday and Tuesday, bollito misto (mixed boiled meats) on Wednesday and Thursday, fritto misto alla Piemontese (mixed deep-fried seafood) on Friday, and a proper big bagna caoda on Saturday thrown in for good measure. </p> <p>That's regularity, dependability, and knowing what your customers want because they keep on coming back. One such was the writer, Cesare Pavese, whose novels and short stories charted the changes in urban Italy in the 30s and 40s. </p> <p>All this information flowed out of the Wing Commander in a seamless flow, in between his discourses on Italian food lore, the wave theory and obscure football players of South America, another topic on which he was bewilderingly well-informed. And while this was going on, I was eating. I ate the plateful of titbits that was supposed to do for both of us; and antipasti caldi alla piemontese, a cracking array of veg - sweet, fleshy roasted pepper with a dab of bagna caoda, a delicate stuffed courgette, a kind of melted roast onion - and other bits too numerous to mention; and a pile of tajarin (a thin egg pasta of the tagliatelle/tagliarini family) with porcini, which was an exercise in silky, sexy slipperiness; and then a helping of bollito misto, which included a slice of ox cheek, a chunk of beef, a slab of veal, a hunk of cotecchino, a section of tongue and a wedge of chicken breast along with four sauces and mostarda di Cremona. Well, I say that I ate all this, but the shaming thing is that I slowed to a crawl and then ground to a halt. Meat-eater's manna though the line-up was, I couldn't finish it. </p> <p>The Wing Commander, meanwhile, continued to discourse and consume in a steady manner.

The shopping mall is a brand new concept: it will take time for them to shift to it.\"</p> <p>Oriental Plaza, which includes office towers and a five-star hotel as well as the mall, occupies an entire block within walking distance of the Forbidden City. Its promoters claim it will rival Oxford Street and the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, but critics say it is out of scale with central Beijing and should never have been built.</p> <p>Yesterday the 100,000 square metre shopping area of the mall was still half empty. Salesgirls stood outside some of the clothes shops hustling for customers as if they were in the street market.</p> <p>But property agent DTZ hails the 1,800 square metre Volkswagen showroom as a sign of the future. Leather-jacketed Chinese entrepreneurs inspect an Audi TT 1.8 coupe - price 800,000 Renminbi (\u00a369,000) - with a confident air.</p> <p>\"Showroom is the wrong word,\" insists VW communications manager Sharon Lee. \"We are a concept store. We try to show the [car] culture you have to tap into. People can feel it and smell it, this is a totally interactive place.\"</p> <p>There is also an exhibition of sculpture from the Academy of Art, because of the \"very close link between cars and art\".</p> <p>The \u00a31.4bn Oriental Plaza is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's most ambitious construction project. It was originally approved by Beijing's former communist party boss Chen Xitong who is now serving a long prison sentence for corruption.</p> <p>Mr Li's connections in Beijing reach as high as President Jiang Zemin. After Chen's downfall, the Oriental Plaza plan was re-evaluated but not scrapped.</p> <p>It was originally planned as one monolithic bloc to be the largest single commercial complex in the world.</p> <p>\"We were not happy with its architectural scale,\" says a senior city architect, Cheng Enjian. \"Our experts complained to the [Communist party] centre that it was too large and did not conform to the centre's own building guidelines.\"</p> <p>The original height not only broke restrictions but would have allowed international executives on the upper floors to spy on the Zhongnanhai - the park-like central government area beyond the Forbidden City where Mr Jiang and other senior figures work.</p> <p>The compromise solution was to lower the maximum height to that of the adjacent Beijing Hotel. The project's total area was also reduced and broken into eight separate blocks.</p> <p>Special exemption was granted to allow working round the clock to make up for the delay. The facade was completed just before last year's 50th anniversary of the communist revolution.</p> <p>According to Mr Cheng, city guidelines also require new buildings in the centre \"not to copy indiscriminately foreign architecture, but to reflect the spirit of the Forbidden City\".</p> <p>However, Oriental Plaza is now hailed officially as an example of modernism appropriate for the new millennium.</p> <p>The Plaza seeks to sell office space by its proximity to the Chinese seat of power, claiming to be \"the most superb location for multinationals\". It draws attention to \"the luxurious interiors of the executive showers (which) emanate exclusivity\".</p> <p>Property analysts have been sceptical about the commercial prospects of such a large supply of office space hitting the market, but the Plaza is pinning its hopes on China's entry to the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>It may take time for the shopping mall to acquire the prestige which it also claims. Foreign retailers have difficulty in obtaining licences unless they can operate under the umbrella of a department store. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Plaza cannot help them.</p> <p>But McDonald's, removed from the site when its lease was terminated in an earlier controversy, is about to re-open.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new shopping mall which is wider than Tiananmen Square has opened in Beijing after years of controversy over the vast Oriental Plaza project to which it belongs. Stretching for hundreds of yards in the heart of the capital, it signals another stage in China's consumer revolution. \"Before, people would only buy on street corners,\" explains property agent Sunnie Wu. \"Then the department stores became popular when they started stocking western-style goods. The shopping mall is a brand new concept: it will take time for them to shift to it.\" Oriental Plaza, which includes office towers and a five-star hotel as well as the mall, occupies an entire block within walking distance of the Forbidden City. Its promoters claim it will rival Oxford Street and the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, but critics say it is out of scale with central Beijing and should never have been built. Yesterday the 100,000 square metre shopping area of the mall was still half empty. Salesgirls stood outside some of the clothes shops hustling for customers as if they were in the street market. But property agent DTZ hails the 1,800 square metre Volkswagen showroom as a sign of the future. Leather-jacketed Chinese entrepreneurs inspect an Audi TT 1.8 coupe - price 800,000 Renminbi (\u00a369,000) - with a confident air. \"Showroom is the wrong word,\" insists VW communications manager Sharon Lee. \"We are a concept store. We try to show the [car] culture you have to tap into. People can feel it and smell it, this is a totally interactive place.\" There is also an exhibition of sculpture from the Academy of Art, because of the \"very close link between cars and art\". The \u00a31.4bn Oriental Plaza is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's most ambitious construction project. It was originally approved by Beijing's former communist party boss Chen Xitong who is now serving a long prison sentence for corruption. Mr Li's connections in Beijing reach as high as President Jiang Zemin. After Chen's downfall, the Oriental Plaza plan was re-evaluated but not scrapped. It was originally planned as one monolithic bloc to be the largest single commercial complex in the world. \"We were not happy with its architectural scale,\" says a senior city architect, Cheng Enjian. \"Our experts complained to the [Communist party] centre that it was too large and did not conform to the centre's own building guidelines.\" The original height not only broke restrictions but would have allowed international executives on the upper floors to spy on the Zhongnanhai - the park-like central government area beyond the Forbidden City where Mr Jiang and other senior figures work. The compromise solution was to lower the maximum height to that of the adjacent Beijing Hotel. The project's total area was also reduced and broken into eight separate blocks. Special exemption was granted to allow working round the clock to make up for the delay. The facade was completed just before last year's 50th anniversary of the communist revolution. According to Mr Cheng, city guidelines also require new buildings in the centre \"not to copy indiscriminately foreign architecture, but to reflect the spirit of the Forbidden City\". However, Oriental Plaza is now hailed officially as an example of modernism appropriate for the new millennium. The Plaza seeks to sell office space by its proximity to the Chinese seat of power, claiming to be \"the most superb location for multinationals\". It draws attention to \"the luxurious interiors of the executive showers (which) emanate exclusivity\". Property analysts have been sceptical about the commercial prospects of such a large supply of office space hitting the market, but the Plaza is pinning its hopes on China's entry to the World Trade Organisation. It may take time for the shopping mall to acquire the prestige which it also claims. Foreign retailers have difficulty in obtaining licences unless they can operate under the umbrella of a department store. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Plaza cannot help them. But McDonald's, removed from the site when its lease was terminated in an earlier controversy, is about to re-open.",

      "body": "<p>It's nearly midnight, and after a full day of meetings conspiring to destroy Ulster's peace deal, Jeffrey Donaldson MP is still on his feet in the local Orange hall. Tonight is supposed to be a celebration of Scots-Ulster culture, with a bit of Lambeg drumming, but instead it's the same old rendition of Orangeism's history. The walls of the Royal Black Preceptory Hall are lined with fading masonic symbols and pictures of the young Queen Elizabeth. At the back is a photographic display of Orangemen in their finest, strutting down the ages from Portadown in the 1910s to the Gulf War of 1991. Plans to walk the \"Queen's Highway\" can't be far below the surface chatter. Tea and sandwiches are laid out on a central table and some of the mainly middle-aged company have brought in beer and drinks in plastic carrier bags.</p> <p>Donaldson takes the microphone: \"I say, let's break out of this siege mentality, let's be proud of our culture, our identity, our tradition.\" The speech, like the event, never quite catches. The crowd claps halfheartedly, as if no one is quite sure how to react.</p> <p>The whole evening has an air of dowdiness. Donaldson unashamedly labours on, praising \"our culture\" again and again, and the ossified mind-set it represents. A drummer appears and bashes away for five ear-splitting minutes on a Lambeg drum, favoured by Blackmen, another sort of Orange Order, for its booming sound that's reputed to scare the living daylights out of Catholics.</p> <p>For Donaldson, on the surface at least, the evening is \"a relaxed expression of the culture rather than what might be seen as the rather more intense expression of the Orange marches\".</p> <p>Orangemen don't like Catholics and they don't like the press, so Donaldson makes a point of publicly introducing the photographer, Keith Bernstein, and me to this most loyal of loyalist companies: \"This is Kevin from the Guardian,\" he says, with just a fraction of a pause after the \"Kevin\".</p> <p>Afterwards, everyone we spoke to was suitably polite and correct, although I must be one of the few Kevins, an identifiable Catholic name, to ever have crossed the threshold of the Lagan Valley Royal Black Preceptory Hall. Genuine or not, Donaldson's endorsement of the Royal Blackmen will do him no harm at the ballot box. He may be a non-smoking, non-drinking Presbyterian, but Donaldson's true religion is politics.</p> <p>Ulster is once more lurching into crisis and the peace process falling apart. David Trimble is sabotaging the vital all-Ireland institutions because the IRA won't decommission its weapons. Martin McGuinness is denouncing Trimble for reneging on the Good Friday agreement. The SDLP is supporting Sinn Fein but attacking the Provos for failing to disarm and thus playing into the hands of Unionist hardliners who want Trimble to pull out of the Ulster executive. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) just hates everyone else. The entire Northern Ireland Assembly is teetering on the verge of collapse, and with it the peace of Ulster. It is Jeffrey Donaldson's hour.</p> <p>For the past two years, ever since he walked out of the Unionist team in the final hours of the 1998 Good Friday agreement negotiations, Donaldson has strived to make \"terrorism a thing of the past\" by undermining, co-agitating and generally seeking the downfall of Unionist leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, David Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist party. Donaldson, Enoch Powell's one-time election agent, is the uncrowned king of the \"No\" wing of Ulster Unionism and has been the main instigator of the five failed internal coups, one every three months since 1998, to unseat Trimble. Two more potential coup attempts are already planned for the spring.</p> <p>Donaldson may have been a Deputy Orange Grand Master, but he is not a Bible-thumping Paisley-style bigot who can easily be dismissed. He is a player, a potential contender, a man to do business with, someone who appears on BBC1's Question Time and who can walk the corridors of the White House.</p> <p>His language is carefully coded, laced with nuance, and keeps within the pre-ordained bounds of television soundbites, but the implication is clear: Trimble is weak, a failure, who is betraying the Unionist cause by letting the IRA run rings around him. Donald-son has an alternative strategy - to secure the leadership for himself - but to get Trimble out, he has to break him on the rock of IRA decommissioning. Beneath their forced smiles and first-name addresses, \"David\" and \"Jeffrey\" must hate each other's guts.</p> <p>None of this internal feuding should matter to the outside world, but for the consequences. The rock that Donaldson is using against Trimble is composed of IRA guns buried deep in the bogs of Donegal. In private, everyone in Northern Ireland's political class accepts that there will be no IRA decommissioning. It is politically impossible for the Republican leadership to hand over guns without provoking a split in their own ranks. Short of issuing a press release to that effect, the IRA has made it as clear as is humanly possible that there is never, ever, going to be a unilateral hand-over of weapons.</p> <p>Under pressure from a Unionist walkout of the Northern Ireland executive last spring, the IRA did relent and allow two independent observers to inspect two IRA arms dumps earlier this year and seal them with an electronic device. But it was only a symbolic political gesture, not the start of a decommissioning process in which actual guns are handed over.</p> <p>But to keep the Stormont show on the road, everyone, particularly Unionist politicians, has to pretend to their electorate that meaningful IRA decommissioning will still happen. Everyone, that is, except Donaldson, who now has a loaded political gun to Trimble's head. To save himself from Donaldson, Trimble has promised his activists progressively to exclude Sinn Fein ministers from the Northern Ireland executive unless the IRA decommissions.</p> <p>Any deadline imposed by the Unionists is guaranteed to provoke an IRA refusal, and hence a political crisis. Trimble will not be able to deliver, and will then either be forced to resign or crash the executive council that acts like a cabinet for the Northern Ireland Assembly. In any event, excluding Sinn Fein ministers will itself soon provoke the collapse of the agreement. \"Donaldson has got Trimble to box himself in against the IRA,\" says one seasoned Northern Ireland commentator. \"We all know the IRA don't like deadlines. The box Trimble is building is in his own political coffin.\"</p> <p>Soon, possibly even as early as Christmas, the whole elaborately constructed Stormont pack of cards is going to hit the deck. \"There is no doubt that Trimble has stepped on to Jeffrey's escalator,\" says Mark Durcan, the SDLP minister of finance on the Northern Ireland executive. \"Jeffrey Donaldson is a significant threat. As long as there is no progress on the decommissioning front, then he has ready ground to rally people to his point of view.\" These days of peace in Northern Ireland, it seems, are numbered.</p> <p>For a man who is set on destroying Tony Blair's greatest political triumph, Donaldson has a surprisingly low profile on what he would term the mainland. He was born in Kilkeel, a Protestant-dominated fishing village on the coast of County Down, in 1962, the first of eight children in a large Presbyterian family. Kilkeel, near the mountains of Mourne, is close to the IRA's border heartlands, but was then, and still is, a backwater where Catholic and Protestant communities live uneasily together. The Troubles struck the Donaldson family early in August 1970, when an older cousin, Sam Donaldson, an RUC policeman, pulled on the door handle of an abandoned car in the village of Crossmaglen. It was an IRA booby trap and the car exploded, killing Sam and a fellow officer, Robert Millar. Sam was the second of 300 RUC men to be killed during the latest wave of Troubles, and the first of 277 to die at the hands of the IRA.</p> <p>Donaldson was seven at the time, but remembers the funeral well. Fifteen years later, another cousin, Alex Donaldson, was killed in the 1985 IRA mortar attack on Newry police station in which nine officers died. When he was 18, Donaldson joined the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and the Young Unionists. \"There are family traditions,\" he says, \"and we had a tradition of serving. But there was an absolute strict adherence to law and order; paramilitarism was totally anathema to my sense of morality.\"</p> <p>Donaldson's family, once farming stock, was committed to the British Crown and its security forces; he, his father Jim and brother James served in the now notorious Ulster Defence Regiment. Officially, the UDR was part of the British Army, but in reality it was a locally recruited Protestant militia that was hated and feared by the Catholic community, not without reason: several members of the UDR have been convicted of serious terrorist offences, including murder, against Catholics. Joining the UDR was not a morally neutral act; it was taking sides in the war for Ulster.</p> <p>\"I do not buy into this argument that the RUC is a Protestant police force,\" insists Donaldson. \"I do not buy into the republican slur that the UDR and the RUC were the armed wings of Unionism. It was republicans who embarked on a sectarian campaign of the murder of Protestants in border areas right across Northern Ireland. How more sectarian can you get? The IRA have killed more Catholics than the UDR ever did,\" he states patiently, his voice never breaking from its almost dispassionate monotone. \"My experience of the UDR is that they went out to do a job and that job was to protect the community against the terrorists, regardless of who the terrorists were.\" I ask if he had ever once seen an act of sectarianism by a fellow serving UDR member. \"No,\" came the surprising reply.</p> <p>Being in the UDR was dangerous - the IRA targeted and killed more than 200 UDR men, usually ambushing them on their days off as they went about their ordinary working lives. One of Donaldson's former UDR comrades, Alan Johnston, was shot dead in 1988. \"Alan lived just around the corner from me. Alan was in my local Young Unionist branch. Alan was murdered, shot in the back as he carried his lunchbox into work one day. Alan was a joiner. Obviously, when I lost a comrade in the UDR, you were angry. There was grief as well, that sense of loss. The experience of losing family, comrades, people you represent, it does leave a mark.\"</p> <p>When he wasn't flying around in British Army helicopters with a rifle across his lap fighting IRA terrorism - he never shot a round in anger - Donaldson devoted the rest of his energies to the Ulster Unionist party. He is a devoted \"pol\", that strange extract of humanity, like William Hague, who collects electoral scores as teenagers rather than football programmes and whose idea of ecstasy is a lectern and an attentive audience. Also like Hague, Donaldson is a tactician. He does not read books, quote philosophy or have political heroes. He is an Orange political geek with no real interests beyond tactical politics, media interviews and electoral counts.</p> <p>Donaldson is only 37 years old, but he has been a full-time political activist since the age of 18, and in that time has fought an endless series of internal and external elections. It's one of the puzzling things about him: how can such an astute, media-conscious politician champion the no-hopers of the anti-agreement camp?</p> <p>Donaldson's break-out from the middling league of domestic politics came from the most revered and reviled British politician of the past century, Enoch Powell. Cast out from the Conservative shadow cabinet for what was viewed as open racism, Powell finally broke, in great bitterness, with the Tories over Europe in 1974 and became the Unionist MP for South Down. In 1983, Donaldson, then 20, turned down a place at Cambridge to become Powell's election agent, running his constituency office. Every Monday morning, after a weekend constituency visit from the English MP, Donaldson would drive Powell to the airport and receive a compulsory lecture from the darkest genius of British politics. \"They were politically orientated,\" he recalls. \"He would talk about Parliament, about the 1974 period leading up to his resignation, about British politics, about American politics. Sometimes, it would be completely different. He was a Greek classical scholar - you'd get a lecture on the Elgin Marbles. He wanted to help me get a foothold. It was real political apprenticeship.\"</p> <p>Powell lost his seat in 1987, but by then Donaldson was already well on his way and had been elected to one of Northern Ireland's putative assemblies that soon collapsed of its own accord. Unlike his intellectual and political mentor, a noted integrationist who could not care less about Stormont, Donaldson insists that he does want to see this latest Northern Ireland Assembly up and working. He wants power back in Ulster. His only difficulty with the current set-up is that he is not in charge. Nor can he now simply slide into Trimble's potentially vacant seat - as punishment for his treachery, Trimble barred Donaldson from standing for the Assembly.</p> <p>Donaldson is not a member and is therefore locked out until a suitable byelection vacancy crops up. But such organisational details are not going to stop him. \"Donaldson is tenacious,\" says one observer. \"The Unionists have this peculiar flaw in their constitution, unknown in every other party, that the leader has to be elected annually. The next date is March 2001. That will be the real test.\" As such, Donaldson may not have to wait for a byelection: \"If things go down the tube and Jeffrey is elected leader,\" says another Unionist Assembly source, \"then there will not be an Assembly for a while anyway, so it does not matter.\"</p> <p>For a man with such clout, Donaldson's personality is thin and he is, even according to his own supporters, an uninspiring speaker whose rhetoric clots around cliches and \"level playing fields\". He looks like an accountant, and is married with two daughters, but the only glimpse of delight I ever saw in him was when he outlined some strategic sleight of hand, a twisting of the political knife, that would add to Trimble's despair.</p> <p>Anywhere else, these traits could be fatal to a career, but amid the current nine-strong company of the aged, the dull, the double-jawed, and the ranting who compose the Ulster Unionist party in the House of Commons, Donaldson is a shining star. \"He is a person of limited talent and limited vision,\" says one opponent. \"He is not a good speaker and is stuck in the groove of old Unionism. But he has got Trimble to a stage where Trimble is almost ready to throw in the towel. What he [Donaldson] would do if he became leader I have no idea.\"</p> <p>After Powell, Donaldson worked for Jim Molyneaux, the veteran Unionist leader, and in 1997 inherited his Lagan Valley seat, on the outskirts of Belfast. Donaldson was already a key figure in the Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to Good Friday 1998. In the final hours, Donaldson walked out and turned his face against Trimble and all his works. \"The idea that I sat there on Good Friday 1998 at Castle Buildings, Stormont, and made a calculated decision that this was in my best political interest not to sign up to the agreement is just absolute nonsense,\" he says. \"I had major concerns about key issues - decommissioning, prisoner releases and the RUC. I asked myself the question, could I walk out of here and go down to my constituency, the people of Lisburn, look them in the eye and say this is a good deal. I could not do that in all conscience. So, I said that they'll open the gates, the prisoners will be released. And here we are, two-and-a-half-years later, and all of the prisoners have been released and not a single bullet has been decommissioned.\"</p> <p>Donaldson hit the rebel road, but he has always been extremely careful to couch his opposition within the bounds of what is deemed acceptable to the staunchly conservative ranks of the Unionist faithful. Nor was chipping away at the limited Protestant support for the agreement exactly a marathon feat: \"Thirty per cent of the Unionist population voted against the agreement and that 30% has risen because of dissatisfaction within Unionism,\" Donaldson explains. \"This process is in trouble not because of me, but because it has lost the confidence of Unionists. And without Unionist support it cannot continue indefinitely in its present form. The pigeons have come home to roost and we have to deal with them.\"</p> <p>The would-be leader wants action on decommissioning and the RUC. He wants Ulster Unionism to toughen up and take on the republicans at their own game of brinkmanship and protracted negotiation. \"We are not using our weight to maximum effect,\" he says. \"I am not looking for surrender from the IRA. What I am looking for is tangible evidence from the republican and loyalist sides that the past is the past and that when they say they are committed to exclusively peaceful means they mean precisely that - because sometimes in politics the threat of violence can be even more potent than the use of violence. I see this in the Assembly. I hear some of my colleagues, ministers in the executive, say, 'But if we do this then the IRA will go back to war.' What's that but an admission that the IRA has got a gun to their heads.\"</p> <p>Donaldson does have a point: the Provisional IRA's interpretation of their exclusive commitment to peaceful means did not prevent them from shooting the Real IRA's Belfast commander, Joseph O'Connor, several times in the head outside his mother's home last month, or killing the republican writer Eamon Collins on the orders of the organisation's former chief-of-staff, or bumping off a whole squad of drug dealers while at the same time resolutely maintaining their ceasefire against the British Army, the RUC and the Protestant community.</p> <p>Under the current rules of engagement in Ulster, internecine republican killings do not count as murders, and are therefore brushed under the Stormont cabinet conference table. Some of them, such as Joseph O'Connor's killing, may be seen as being politically expedient, but none exactly substantiates republican claims that their guns are behind them. \"I do not have a private army behind me,\" says Donaldson. \"I do not have stockpiles of arms and explosives. I do not have the power that comes from the overarching threat of violence. It's not in my interest to place myself across the table from that sort of power.\"</p> <p>Pulling the plug on what one fellow anti-agreement Unionist MP terms \"the toytown Parliament\" at Stormont might not be so easy, however. Even the rejectionists of Ian Paisley's DUP have grown fond of the Assembly's leather benches, their British-taxpayer-paid \u00a338,000 per annum salaries, the allowances, the ministerial salaries of \u00a371,000, the secretaries, the special advisers, the ministerial cars, Hansard, and their own self-importance in a region, population-wise, that is no bigger than Yorkshire. Donaldson will have a hard time persuading the 28 elected Unionist assemblymen that an Ulster version of political hara-kiri is a sound strategic move.</p> <p>Events may help make the decision for them. Perhaps the greatest boost to Donaldson's cause was the result of the South Antrim byelection two months ago, when a 16,000 Ulster Unionist majority was wiped out by the DUP gospel-singing Rev William McCrea, whose hostility to Catholics is matched only by his hatred of the sheer notion of sharing power with them. South Antrim was the Ulster Unionists' second safest seat in Westminster, and if the same swing were carried over into the generalelection, which is expected next year, there would no longer be an Ulster Unionist party left to split.</p> <p>The fatal flaw in Donaldson's case is the one that is most constantly levelled against him by his opponents: what is his alternative? Donaldson's answer is that, by somehow ripping up the Good Friday agreement and bringing down the executive, Unionists can carve a better deal from Ulster's stony political ground. \"Inadequate as the arms inspections have been, we would not have got them unless we had exerted political leverage at the time by withdrawing from the executive,\" he asserts. \"I think too many people have too much invested in this process to see it collapse. I do not subscribe to the defeatist attitude - the whole thing collapses.\"</p> <p>It's not exactly a detailed plan, and his optimistic view of future events is certainly not shared by Blair, the US president Bill Clinton, the Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, or, most obviously, Trimble, who has dismissed Donaldson's arguments as a \"Santa wish-list\" - they all believe that there is no real alternative to the messy, inglorious compromises that were hammered out after years of tedious negotiation. Donaldson walked away, and so cannot now unravel the entire peace process just because, like his mentor Powell, he excluded himself from power by his own rashness.</p> <p>However imperfect, the Good Friday agreement is the last, best hope that Ireland's Troubles are finally over. Donaldson may yet succeed in bringing down the Unionist house in order to destroy his rival, Trimble. But the real outcome of this personal battle between two embittered sons of Ulster is far more likely to rekindle terrorism in the present than bury it forever in the past.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's nearly midnight, and after a full day of meetings conspiring to destroy Ulster's peace deal, Jeffrey Donaldson MP is still on his feet in the local Orange hall. Tonight is supposed to be a celebration of Scots-Ulster culture, with a bit of Lambeg drumming, but instead it's the same old rendition of Orangeism's history. The walls of the Royal Black Preceptory Hall are lined with fading masonic symbols and pictures of the young Queen Elizabeth. At the back is a photographic display of Orangemen in their finest, strutting down the ages from Portadown in the 1910s to the Gulf War of 1991. Plans to walk the \"Queen's Highway\" can't be far below the surface chatter. Tea and sandwiches are laid out on a central table and some of the mainly middle-aged company have brought in beer and drinks in plastic carrier bags. Donaldson takes the microphone: \"I say, let's break out of this siege mentality, let's be proud of our culture, our identity, our tradition.\" The speech, like the event, never quite catches. The crowd claps halfheartedly, as if no one is quite sure how to react. The whole evening has an air of dowdiness. Donaldson unashamedly labours on, praising \"our culture\" again and again, and the ossified mind-set it represents. A drummer appears and bashes away for five ear-splitting minutes on a Lambeg drum, favoured by Blackmen, another sort of Orange Order, for its booming sound that's reputed to scare the living daylights out of Catholics. For Donaldson, on the surface at least, the evening is \"a relaxed expression of the culture rather than what might be seen as the rather more intense expression of the Orange marches\". Orangemen don't like Catholics and they don't like the press, so Donaldson makes a point of publicly introducing the photographer, Keith Bernstein, and me to this most loyal of loyalist companies: \"This is Kevin from the Guardian,\" he says, with just a fraction of a pause after the \"Kevin\". Afterwards, everyone we spoke to was suitably polite and correct, although I must be one of the few Kevins, an identifiable Catholic name, to ever have crossed the threshold of the Lagan Valley Royal Black Preceptory Hall. Genuine or not, Donaldson's endorsement of the Royal Blackmen will do him no harm at the ballot box. He may be a non-smoking, non-drinking Presbyterian, but Donaldson's true religion is politics. Ulster is once more lurching into crisis and the peace process falling apart. David Trimble is sabotaging the vital all-Ireland institutions because the IRA won't decommission its weapons. Martin McGuinness is denouncing Trimble for reneging on the Good Friday agreement. The SDLP is supporting Sinn Fein but attacking the Provos for failing to disarm and thus playing into the hands of Unionist hardliners who want Trimble to pull out of the Ulster executive. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) just hates everyone else. The entire Northern Ireland Assembly is teetering on the verge of collapse, and with it the peace of Ulster. It is Jeffrey Donaldson's hour. For the past two years, ever since he walked out of the Unionist team in the final hours of the 1998 Good Friday agreement negotiations, Donaldson has strived to make \"terrorism a thing of the past\" by undermining, co-agitating and generally seeking the downfall of Unionist leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, David Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist party. Donaldson, Enoch Powell's one-time election agent, is the uncrowned king of the \"No\" wing of Ulster Unionism and has been the main instigator of the five failed internal coups, one every three months since 1998, to unseat Trimble. Two more potential coup attempts are already planned for the spring. Donaldson may have been a Deputy Orange Grand Master, but he is not a Bible-thumping Paisley-style bigot who can easily be dismissed. He is a player, a potential contender, a man to do business with, someone who appears on BBC1's Question Time and who can walk the corridors of the White House. His language is carefully coded, laced with nuance, and keeps within the pre-ordained bounds of television soundbites, but the implication is clear: Trimble is weak, a failure, who is betraying the Unionist cause by letting the IRA run rings around him. Donald-son has an alternative strategy - to secure the leadership for himself - but to get Trimble out, he has to break him on the rock of IRA decommissioning. Beneath their forced smiles and first-name addresses, \"David\" and \"Jeffrey\" must hate each other's guts. None of this internal feuding should matter to the outside world, but for the consequences. The rock that Donaldson is using against Trimble is composed of IRA guns buried deep in the bogs of Donegal. In private, everyone in Northern Ireland's political class accepts that there will be no IRA decommissioning. It is politically impossible for the Republican leadership to hand over guns without provoking a split in their own ranks. Short of issuing a press release to that effect, the IRA has made it as clear as is humanly possible that there is never, ever, going to be a unilateral hand-over of weapons. Under pressure from a Unionist walkout of the Northern Ireland executive last spring, the IRA did relent and allow two independent observers to inspect two IRA arms dumps earlier this year and seal them with an electronic device. But it was only a symbolic political gesture, not the start of a decommissioning process in which actual guns are handed over. But to keep the Stormont show on the road, everyone, particularly Unionist politicians, has to pretend to their electorate that meaningful IRA decommissioning will still happen. Everyone, that is, except Donaldson, who now has a loaded political gun to Trimble's head. To save himself from Donaldson, Trimble has promised his activists progressively to exclude Sinn Fein ministers from the Northern Ireland executive unless the IRA decommissions. Any deadline imposed by the Unionists is guaranteed to provoke an IRA refusal, and hence a political crisis. Trimble will not be able to deliver, and will then either be forced to resign or crash the executive council that acts like a cabinet for the Northern Ireland Assembly. In any event, excluding Sinn Fein ministers will itself soon provoke the collapse of the agreement. \"Donaldson has got Trimble to box himself in against the IRA,\" says one seasoned Northern Ireland commentator. \"We all know the IRA don't like deadlines. The box Trimble is building is in his own political coffin.\" Soon, possibly even as early as Christmas, the whole elaborately constructed Stormont pack of cards is going to hit the deck. \"There is no doubt that Trimble has stepped on to Jeffrey's escalator,\" says Mark Durcan, the SDLP minister of finance on the Northern Ireland executive. \"Jeffrey Donaldson is a significant threat. As long as there is no progress on the decommissioning front, then he has ready ground to rally people to his point of view.\" These days of peace in Northern Ireland, it seems, are numbered. For a man who is set on destroying Tony Blair's greatest political triumph, Donaldson has a surprisingly low profile on what he would term the mainland. He was born in Kilkeel, a Protestant-dominated fishing village on the coast of County Down, in 1962, the first of eight children in a large Presbyterian family. Kilkeel, near the mountains of Mourne, is close to the IRA's border heartlands, but was then, and still is, a backwater where Catholic and Protestant communities live uneasily together. The Troubles struck the Donaldson family early in August 1970, when an older cousin, Sam Donaldson, an RUC policeman, pulled on the door handle of an abandoned car in the village of Crossmaglen. It was an IRA booby trap and the car exploded, killing Sam and a fellow officer, Robert Millar. Sam was the second of 300 RUC men to be killed during the latest wave of Troubles, and the first of 277 to die at the hands of the IRA. Donaldson was seven at the time, but remembers the funeral well. Fifteen years later, another cousin, Alex Donaldson, was killed in the 1985 IRA mortar attack on Newry police station in which nine officers died. When he was 18, Donaldson joined the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and the Young Unionists. \"There are family traditions,\" he says, \"and we had a tradition of serving. But there was an absolute strict adherence to law and order; paramilitarism was totally anathema to my sense of morality.\" Donaldson's family, once farming stock, was committed to the British Crown and its security forces; he, his father Jim and brother James served in the now notorious Ulster Defence Regiment. Officially, the UDR was part of the British Army, but in reality it was a locally recruited Protestant militia that was hated and feared by the Catholic community, not without reason: several members of the UDR have been convicted of serious terrorist offences, including murder, against Catholics. Joining the UDR was not a morally neutral act; it was taking sides in the war for Ulster. \"I do not buy into this argument that the RUC is a Protestant police force,\" insists Donaldson. \"I do not buy into the republican slur that the UDR and the RUC were the armed wings of Unionism. It was republicans who embarked on a sectarian campaign of the murder of Protestants in border areas right across Northern Ireland. How more sectarian can you get? The IRA have killed more Catholics than the UDR ever did,\" he states patiently, his voice never breaking from its almost dispassionate monotone. \"My experience of the UDR is that they went out to do a job and that job was to protect the community against the terrorists, regardless of who the terrorists were.\" I ask if he had ever once seen an act of sectarianism by a fellow serving UDR member. \"No,\" came the surprising reply. Being in the UDR was dangerous - the IRA targeted and killed more than 200 UDR men, usually ambushing them on their days off as they went about their ordinary working lives. One of Donaldson's former UDR comrades, Alan Johnston, was shot dead in 1988. \"Alan lived just around the corner from me. Alan was in my local Young Unionist branch. Alan was murdered, shot in the back as he carried his lunchbox into work one day. Alan was a joiner. Obviously, when I lost a comrade in the UDR, you were angry. There was grief as well, that sense of loss. The experience of losing family, comrades, people you represent, it does leave a mark.\" When he wasn't flying around in British Army helicopters with a rifle across his lap fighting IRA terrorism - he never shot a round in anger - Donaldson devoted the rest of his energies to the Ulster Unionist party. He is a devoted \"pol\", that strange extract of humanity, like William Hague, who collects electoral scores as teenagers rather than football programmes and whose idea of ecstasy is a lectern and an attentive audience. Also like Hague, Donaldson is a tactician. He does not read books, quote philosophy or have political heroes. He is an Orange political geek with no real interests beyond tactical politics, media interviews and electoral counts. Donaldson is only 37 years old, but he has been a full-time political activist since the age of 18, and in that time has fought an endless series of internal and external elections. It's one of the puzzling things about him: how can such an astute, media-conscious politician champion the no-hopers of the anti-agreement camp? Donaldson's break-out from the middling league of domestic politics came from the most revered and reviled British politician of the past century, Enoch Powell. Cast out from the Conservative shadow cabinet for what was viewed as open racism, Powell finally broke, in great bitterness, with the Tories over Europe in 1974 and became the Unionist MP for South Down. In 1983, Donaldson, then 20, turned down a place at Cambridge to become Powell's election agent, running his constituency office. Every Monday morning, after a weekend constituency visit from the English MP, Donaldson would drive Powell to the airport and receive a compulsory lecture from the darkest genius of British politics. \"They were politically orientated,\" he recalls. \"He would talk about Parliament, about the 1974 period leading up to his resignation, about British politics, about American politics. Sometimes, it would be completely different. He was a Greek classical scholar - you'd get a lecture on the Elgin Marbles. He wanted to help me get a foothold. It was real political apprenticeship.\" Powell lost his seat in 1987, but by then Donaldson was already well on his way and had been elected to one of Northern Ireland's putative assemblies that soon collapsed of its own accord. Unlike his intellectual and political mentor, a noted integrationist who could not care less about Stormont, Donaldson insists that he does want to see this latest Northern Ireland Assembly up and working. He wants power back in Ulster. His only difficulty with the current set-up is that he is not in charge. Nor can he now simply slide into Trimble's potentially vacant seat - as punishment for his treachery, Trimble barred Donaldson from standing for the Assembly. Donaldson is not a member and is therefore locked out until a suitable byelection vacancy crops up. But such organisational details are not going to stop him. \"Donaldson is tenacious,\" says one observer. \"The Unionists have this peculiar flaw in their constitution, unknown in every other party, that the leader has to be elected annually. The next date is March 2001. That will be the real test.\" As such, Donaldson may not have to wait for a byelection: \"If things go down the tube and Jeffrey is elected leader,\" says another Unionist Assembly source, \"then there will not be an Assembly for a while anyway, so it does not matter.\" For a man with such clout, Donaldson's personality is thin and he is, even according to his own supporters, an uninspiring speaker whose rhetoric clots around cliches and \"level playing fields\". He looks like an accountant, and is married with two daughters, but the only glimpse of delight I ever saw in him was when he outlined some strategic sleight of hand, a twisting of the political knife, that would add to Trimble's despair. Anywhere else, these traits could be fatal to a career, but amid the current nine-strong company of the aged, the dull, the double-jawed, and the ranting who compose the Ulster Unionist party in the House of Commons, Donaldson is a shining star. \"He is a person of limited talent and limited vision,\" says one opponent. \"He is not a good speaker and is stuck in the groove of old Unionism. But he has got Trimble to a stage where Trimble is almost ready to throw in the towel. What he [Donaldson] would do if he became leader I have no idea.\" After Powell, Donaldson worked for Jim Molyneaux, the veteran Unionist leader, and in 1997 inherited his Lagan Valley seat, on the outskirts of Belfast. Donaldson was already a key figure in the Unionist negotiating team in the run-up to Good Friday 1998. In the final hours, Donaldson walked out and turned his face against Trimble and all his works. \"The idea that I sat there on Good Friday 1998 at Castle Buildings, Stormont, and made a calculated decision that this was in my best political interest not to sign up to the agreement is just absolute nonsense,\" he says. \"I had major concerns about key issues - decommissioning, prisoner releases and the RUC.

And without Unionist support it cannot continue indefinitely in its present form. The pigeons have come home to roost and we have to deal with them.\" The would-be leader wants action on decommissioning and the RUC. He wants Ulster Unionism to toughen up and take on the republicans at their own game of brinkmanship and protracted negotiation. \"We are not using our weight to maximum effect,\" he says. \"I am not looking for surrender from the IRA. What I am looking for is tangible evidence from the republican and loyalist sides that the past is the past and that when they say they are committed to exclusively peaceful means they mean precisely that - because sometimes in politics the threat of violence can be even more potent than the use of violence. I see this in the Assembly. I hear some of my colleagues, ministers in the executive, say, 'But if we do this then the IRA will go back to war.' What's that but an admission that the IRA has got a gun to their heads.\" Donaldson does have a point: the Provisional IRA's interpretation of their exclusive commitment to peaceful means did not prevent them from shooting the Real IRA's Belfast commander, Joseph O'Connor, several times in the head outside his mother's home last month, or killing the republican writer Eamon Collins on the orders of the organisation's former chief-of-staff, or bumping off a whole squad of drug dealers while at the same time resolutely maintaining their ceasefire against the British Army, the RUC and the Protestant community. Under the current rules of engagement in Ulster, internecine republican killings do not count as murders, and are therefore brushed under the Stormont cabinet conference table. Some of them, such as Joseph O'Connor's killing, may be seen as being politically expedient, but none exactly substantiates republican claims that their guns are behind them. \"I do not have a private army behind me,\" says Donaldson. \"I do not have stockpiles of arms and explosives. I do not have the power that comes from the overarching threat of violence. It's not in my interest to place myself across the table from that sort of power.\" Pulling the plug on what one fellow anti-agreement Unionist MP terms \"the toytown Parliament\" at Stormont might not be so easy, however. Even the rejectionists of Ian Paisley's DUP have grown fond of the Assembly's leather benches, their British-taxpayer-paid \u00a338,000 per annum salaries, the allowances, the ministerial salaries of \u00a371,000, the secretaries, the special advisers, the ministerial cars, Hansard, and their own self-importance in a region, population-wise, that is no bigger than Yorkshire.

Rated by many City analysts as a company to watch and buy a stake in, the future looks positive. But it's one to hold until you see more evidence of programmes produced by Union 175 coming to a television near you.",

      "body": "<b>John Vidal</b> <p>Mrs G is a broken woman. She has come to central London from the suburbs and wants to get to Hatfield, a 40-mile journey that used to take an hour. She has missed two cancelled commuter trains and one that was too full to squeeze on to. Now, at 10.45am, she has taken 135 minutes to get to King's Cross. </p> <p>\"Sorry, ma'am,\" says the enquiries man. \"You'll have to start at Farringdon Road.\" </p> <p>\"But how? Why? The trains start here.\" </p> <p>\"You'd be better off there.\" </p> <p>\"I don't understand ...\" </p> <p>\"Neither, exactly, do I,\" he says, looking Hatfield up in a big fat book. </p> <p>Mrs G puts her bags down, and stares up at the electronic board. It clicks and whirrs. Hatfield comes up. \"Ooooh, goodness ... it's here,\" she says, running off. Three minutes later, she is back and the sign has gone, too. </p> <p>In India there might be a riot. In the United States, verbal abuse would fly. The Germans would find it hard to imagine, but a zen-like calm - or a dull acceptance - is now falling on British rail travellers. </p> <p>My intention is to take a 250 mile loop through middle England, to Birmingham via Peterborough. Once it would take four hours. No one will guess today, but Railtrack staff say there should be \"no problem\". </p> <p>The plan hits the buffers immediately. There is no train for at least an hour. By 11.30, 200 of us have boarded the Leeds express, which has three empty first class coaches and three overflowing standard ones. Soon we are dawdling through fields and stopping at nothing in particular. We pay \u00a34.30 for a cup of coffee and a sandwich. </p> <p>Coach three admires the floods. We pass time in sidings, we watch the rain, read and swap tall train tales. Mrs Giling from Brighton has \"rations\" - sandwiches and a flask - because she knows it could be a long haul to Leeds. Mr Edwards says he spent eight hours instead of four getting to Edinburgh last week. Mr Jones says he took 12 hours and a bus. </p> <p>The normal 63-minute journey to Peterborough takes 145 minutes. Mr Edwards remarks that he saw some men working on lines near Birmingham last week, but no-one else has seen any evidence of repairs being done. \"They come out at night,\" the ticket collector says. \"Just like moles. So we don't disrupt the service.\" </p> <p>Peterborough is chaos with the tannoy blaring apologies, but three young GNER workers say things are improving. Victor Kuch, acting as today's flakcatcher with a special enquiries stall at the station, says he was asked 10,846 questions about what's happening. \"In old BR days we would have told people to piss off. Now we do it with a smile,\" he says, adding that GNER has lost half its travellers since the \"troubles\". </p> <p>\"We got a lot of abuse to start with, but it's normal now,\" he says. \"They (the customers) know there's no use jumping and screaming.\" He reckons the service in Britain is still far better than in the US. \"They say we have the best trains in the world. They love us.\" </p> <p>In the waiting room, Candy, a student from southern China, does not love the railways. It has taken two hours to get the few miles from Grantham and she has missed an interview in Cambridge: \"Trains here are very late and very, very, very expensive,\" she says. \"In China they are like buses.\" </p> <p>On platform five, Mita Devli, an Indian from Tanzania, has been saying goodbye to her Auntie Mina. \"Where is the train?\" she asks. \"I must get to Bath. Trains in India were much more reliable,\" she says. </p> <p>A grubby one-coacher grandly named The John Constable arrives. In a few seconds it is standing room only. \"We're on time,\" says the guard, but it leaves 10 minutes late. </p> <p>The 2.15 to Brum is 30 minutes late arriving, but it is quite possible, says a well-seasoned traveller, that it is a later one which is actually early. </p> <p>We grind slowly past bleak, empty sidings and acres of polluted former industrial land. \"Mustn't grumble,\" says a woman near Leicester. \"You can't expect them to sort out these problems without a bit of inconvenience. We have to support them.\" </p> <p>In the main hall in Birmingham New Street station hundreds of commuters are craning necks to the noticeboard. Many more are lying down, picnicking or asleep. </p> <p>Once there was a fast Virgin train to London every half hour. The emergency timetable says there is now one every hour which takes roughly twice as long. Finding them is hopeless. The \"customer reception\" desk says there is one in 50 minutes. The inquiry office says it is leaving in 20. But then the tannoy says that there is one on platform four. We rush. Too late. The train is there but the Virgin staff refuse to let latecomers on. In fact the 4.45 to London has been delayed just 12 minutes. Sixty-four exhausted people squeeze into coach six. The usual 1hr 40 min journey is predicted to take an extra 20 minutes. </p> <p>John, our train manager, tells us a preceding train has got a dodgy door and needs to be examined. But few people hear him because they are mostly asleep. We arrive in Euston at 7.45pm, after almost 10 hours. Is it getting any better, we ask the ticket collector. \"You tell me,\" he says. Smiling. </p> <p><b>Luke Harding in Agra</b></p> <p>If Gerald Corbett had boarded the 7.15am Taj Express to Agra yesterday, he might have been pleasantly surprised by the journey. The train was clean and left just three minutes late. Only a few people had to stand in the corridor. </p> <p>As the Indian countryside whizzed by, and the coffee wallah came round offering another cup of sweet Indian coffee for the paltry sum of five rupees, the former Railtrack chief executive might have usefully pondered what he did wrong. </p> <p>Unlike Britain's train system, India's still works. It was, of course, the British who built India's railways 150 years ago, in an epic feat of engineering which would connect the beaches of south India with the Khyber Pass. In total, the British laid 23,000 miles of track, in what turned out to be the biggest construction project ever carried out by a colonial power. But since then Britain seems to have lost the knack of managing railways. In India the trains continue to run with reasonable efficiency, despite the vast distances. </p> <p>Arriving at Nizamuddin station in New Delhi in the early morning gloom, I was reassured to see my name on a list of passengers with seats to travel. The platform was crowded. Some of the people on it were going on a journey; the rest live permanently in the station. </p> <p>There were plenty of diversions - tea stalls, phone booths, newspaper sellers, and a man frying pakoras in a giant pan of oil. </p> <p>The trick with Indian trains is to make a reservation first. With a population of 1bn, there is no point in turning up in the hope you will get a seat. With this in mind, I dropped into my local station two days beforehand. The queues are long, there is a tea break at 11.30am, but eventually you get there. </p> <p>My ticket to Agra from Delhi cost a mere 156 rupees (\u00a32.40), not bad for a round trip of about 300 miles. The train rolled in on time. I found my seat, S2 71. Amazingly, there was no one in it. Soon, though, a row erupted next to me. A young man was refusing to give up his seat to the old man who had actually reserved it. As the train clattered through Delhi's unlovely industrial southern suburbs, Vijay Menon, on his way to see his family in Agra, told of his brother, who was once stuck on a train to Bangalore for three days. \"He went to sleep and woke up to find he was still at the same station. There had been an oil spill.\" </p> <p>Most passengers with experience of British trains, however, agreed that the ones in India were more reliable. </p> <p>\"The Central Line is horrible. I do a lot of commuting by tube and they are always breaking down,\" said Veena Chauhan, a civil servant from Ealing, west London, visiting relatives in India. \"Indian railways are very good considering how vast the country is.\" </p> <p>Gradually, the suburbs gave way to countryside, a flat expanse of scrub, thatched farm buildings and cattle egrets. </p> <p>Inside the carriage a sock-wallah was trying to sell nylon socks at 10 rupees (13p) a pair. She was followed by the crisp-wallah, the newspaper-wallah, the ticket inspector, a blind singing beggar, and the peanut man. Finally the breakfast wallah came round. I bought two veg cutlets and a slice of bread for 15 rupees. </p> <p>Travelling by train in India is still a genuinely demotic experience. You might sit next to a cabinet minister or an illiterate cowherd. </p> <p>The Indian railway is also the world's largest employer, with 1.6m staff and 11m passengers a day. That the system works at all is miraculous. The fact that we arrived in Agra 15 minutes late was forgivable. </p> <p>\"In India we are not so worried about time. In the western world everyone is running around all the time. We just want to enjoy ourselves, go out for dinner, that kind of thing,\" said one of the passengers, Squadron Leader Ashok. </p> <p>Gerald Corbett, as he disappears from the fray into India for a month, might just agree.</p>",

Three minutes later, she is back and the sign has gone, too. In India there might be a riot. In the United States, verbal abuse would fly. The Germans would find it hard to imagine, but a zen-like calm - or a dull acceptance - is now falling on British rail travellers. My intention is to take a 250 mile loop through middle England, to Birmingham via Peterborough. Once it would take four hours. No one will guess today, but Railtrack staff say there should be \"no problem\". The plan hits the buffers immediately. There is no train for at least an hour. By 11.30, 200 of us have boarded the Leeds express, which has three empty first class coaches and three overflowing standard ones. Soon we are dawdling through fields and stopping at nothing in particular. We pay \u00a34.30 for a cup of coffee and a sandwich. Coach three admires the floods. We pass time in sidings, we watch the rain, read and swap tall train tales. Mrs Giling from Brighton has \"rations\" - sandwiches and a flask - because she knows it could be a long haul to Leeds. Mr Edwards says he spent eight hours instead of four getting to Edinburgh last week. Mr Jones says he took 12 hours and a bus. The normal 63-minute journey to Peterborough takes 145 minutes. Mr Edwards remarks that he saw some men working on lines near Birmingham last week, but no-one else has seen any evidence of repairs being done. \"They come out at night,\" the ticket collector says. \"Just like moles. So we don't disrupt the service.\" Peterborough is chaos with the tannoy blaring apologies, but three young GNER workers say things are improving. Victor Kuch, acting as today's flakcatcher with a special enquiries stall at the station, says he was asked 10,846 questions about what's happening. \"In old BR days we would have told people to piss off. Now we do it with a smile,\" he says, adding that GNER has lost half its travellers since the \"troubles\". \"We got a lot of abuse to start with, but it's normal now,\" he says. \"They (the customers) know there's no use jumping and screaming.\" He reckons the service in Britain is still far better than in the US. \"They say we have the best trains in the world. They love us.\" In the waiting room, Candy, a student from southern China, does not love the railways. It has taken two hours to get the few miles from Grantham and she has missed an interview in Cambridge: \"Trains here are very late and very, very, very expensive,\" she says. \"In China they are like buses.\" On platform five, Mita Devli, an Indian from Tanzania, has been saying goodbye to her Auntie Mina. \"Where is the train?\" she asks. \"I must get to Bath. Trains in India were much more reliable,\" she says. A grubby one-coacher grandly named The John Constable arrives. In a few seconds it is standing room only. \"We're on time,\" says the guard, but it leaves 10 minutes late. The 2.15 to Brum is 30 minutes late arriving, but it is quite possible, says a well-seasoned traveller, that it is a later one which is actually early. We grind slowly past bleak, empty sidings and acres of polluted former industrial land. \"Mustn't grumble,\" says a woman near Leicester. \"You can't expect them to sort out these problems without a bit of inconvenience. We have to support them.\" In the main hall in Birmingham New Street station hundreds of commuters are craning necks to the noticeboard. Many more are lying down, picnicking or asleep. Once there was a fast Virgin train to London every half hour. The emergency timetable says there is now one every hour which takes roughly twice as long. Finding them is hopeless. The \"customer reception\" desk says there is one in 50 minutes. The inquiry office says it is leaving in 20. But then the tannoy says that there is one on platform four. We rush. Too late. The train is there but the Virgin staff refuse to let latecomers on. In fact the 4.45 to London has been delayed just 12 minutes. Sixty-four exhausted people squeeze into coach six. The usual 1hr 40 min journey is predicted to take an extra 20 minutes. John, our train manager, tells us a preceding train has got a dodgy door and needs to be examined. But few people hear him because they are mostly asleep. We arrive in Euston at 7.45pm, after almost 10 hours. Is it getting any better, we ask the ticket collector. \"You tell me,\" he says. Smiling. Luke Harding in Agra If Gerald Corbett had boarded the 7.15am Taj Express to Agra yesterday, he might have been pleasantly surprised by the journey. The train was clean and left just three minutes late. Only a few people had to stand in the corridor. As the Indian countryside whizzed by, and the coffee wallah came round offering another cup of sweet Indian coffee for the paltry sum of five rupees, the former Railtrack chief executive might have usefully pondered what he did wrong. Unlike Britain's train system, India's still works. It was, of course, the British who built India's railways 150 years ago, in an epic feat of engineering which would connect the beaches of south India with the Khyber Pass. In total, the British laid 23,000 miles of track, in what turned out to be the biggest construction project ever carried out by a colonial power. But since then Britain seems to have lost the knack of managing railways. In India the trains continue to run with reasonable efficiency, despite the vast distances. Arriving at Nizamuddin station in New Delhi in the early morning gloom, I was reassured to see my name on a list of passengers with seats to travel. The platform was crowded. Some of the people on it were going on a journey; the rest live permanently in the station. There were plenty of diversions - tea stalls, phone booths, newspaper sellers, and a man frying pakoras in a giant pan of oil. The trick with Indian trains is to make a reservation first. With a population of 1bn, there is no point in turning up in the hope you will get a seat. With this in mind, I dropped into my local station two days beforehand. The queues are long, there is a tea break at 11.30am, but eventually you get there. My ticket to Agra from Delhi cost a mere 156 rupees (\u00a32.40), not bad for a round trip of about 300 miles. The train rolled in on time. I found my seat, S2 71. Amazingly, there was no one in it. Soon, though, a row erupted next to me. A young man was refusing to give up his seat to the old man who had actually reserved it. As the train clattered through Delhi's unlovely industrial southern suburbs, Vijay Menon, on his way to see his family in Agra, told of his brother, who was once stuck on a train to Bangalore for three days. \"He went to sleep and woke up to find he was still at the same station. There had been an oil spill.\" Most passengers with experience of British trains, however, agreed that the ones in India were more reliable. \"The Central Line is horrible. I do a lot of commuting by tube and they are always breaking down,\" said Veena Chauhan, a civil servant from Ealing, west London, visiting relatives in India. \"Indian railways are very good considering how vast the country is.\" Gradually, the suburbs gave way to countryside, a flat expanse of scrub, thatched farm buildings and cattle egrets. Inside the carriage a sock-wallah was trying to sell nylon socks at 10 rupees (13p) a pair. She was followed by the crisp-wallah, the newspaper-wallah, the ticket inspector, a blind singing beggar, and the peanut man. Finally the breakfast wallah came round. I bought two veg cutlets and a slice of bread for 15 rupees. Travelling by train in India is still a genuinely demotic experience. You might sit next to a cabinet minister or an illiterate cowherd. The Indian railway is also the world's largest employer, with 1.6m staff and 11m passengers a day. That the system works at all is miraculous. The fact that we arrived in Agra 15 minutes late was forgivable. \"In India we are not so worried about time. In the western world everyone is running around all the time. We just want to enjoy ourselves, go out for dinner, that kind of thing,\" said one of the passengers, Squadron Leader Ashok. Gerald Corbett, as he disappears from the fray into India for a month, might just agree.",

Not that it has stirred whole schools of poets to eloquent lamentations, or inspired a major fiction of pity and terror. On the contrary, most Irish writers have reacted to the Northern Troubles as writers usually react to political events, by reaching defiantly for their artistic integrity. Rather than pen epics of the Bogside or sonnets of the Shankill, Irish authors are more likely to write essays on how the artistic imagination can't be vulgarly enlisted for political ends. And this may be all to the good. Writers are sometimes expected to speak out in a crisis; but since they are often an impractical, narcissistic, rampantly individualist bunch, allergic to analytical thought, it is hard to see quite why. The fantasies that fuel their art are also what unfit them for membership of the sanitation committee. </p> <p>What the Troubles have done, with grisly irony, is help put Ireland on the international map. There are healthier ways of going global, but the Irish have long been dab hands at the less desirable methods of attracting world attention, such as mass emigration. Hard on the heels of the Troubles prowled the Celtic Tiger, as an economic boom in the south of the island accompanied the steep decline of the north. This, too, bent the world's eye on this inconsiderable \"afterthought of Europe\", as Joyce called the place. For the first time in centuries, it was cool rather than corny to be Irish. English youth swarm over to Dublin for boozy weekends, while their elders holiday more sedately in the small towns of west Cork. The Irish had long been used to impressing the world more by their cultural products than their balance of trade or military hardware. But now this is happening on the cosmopolitan scale of Riverdance, U2 and Paddywood (the country's thriving film industry), rather than just at international James Joyce symposia. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising, then, that almost every English publisher now seems to want its Companion to Irish studies or Encyclopaedia of Eire. In the wake of both Troubles and Tiger had poured a torrential flood of Irish anthologies, cultural dictionaries and bluffer's guides. Among the finest of these on the literary front was Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland, a blockbuster of a book that he has now followed up with the equally door-stopping Irish Classics. Kiberd is a Dublin academic, but he has the talent for popularising of the public intellectual. Witty, astute, and compulsively readable, he knows how to shape a critical narrative and where to slide in a comic aside. </p> <p>This extravagantly ambitious book takes us all the way from the decline of the Irish bards in the early 17th century to the Belfast Agreement of 1998, pausing en route to discuss such luminaries as Swift, Sheridan, Burke, Wilde, Shaw, Synge, Flann O'Brien and a good deal besides. Since Kiberd is a fluent Irish speaker, we find interwoven with his accounts of the Anglophone literature of Ireland some richly rewarding dips into its Irish-language heritage: late bardic poets like D\u00e1ibhi \u00d3 Braudair and Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille, the remarkable 18th-century woman elegist Eibhl\u00edn Dhubh N\u00ed Chonailll, and the towering 20th-century Gaelic poet Sean \u00d3 R\u00edordain. For this was a land caught on the hop between cultures and identities, bereft of a single dominant tradition, compelled to make itself up as it went along. And that was one reason why, from Oscar Wilde to Samuel Beckett, it was to prove so hospitable to the experimental spirit of modernism. In the early 20th century, the only truly native modernism in the British isles sprang ironically from its most economically backward, politically turbulent region: Ireland. The English, by contrast, had to import most of their modernism from Europe and the US, as they import most of their cultural theory today. </p> <p>Like all Kiberd's writing, Irish Classics has an infectious verve about it that can lapse at times into a rather relentless up-beatness.

      "bodyText": "Irish Classics Declan Kiberd 715pp, Granta \u00a325 Buy it at BOL The mayhem in Northern Ireland has done wonders for Irish literature. Not that it has stirred whole schools of poets to eloquent lamentations, or inspired a major fiction of pity and terror. On the contrary, most Irish writers have reacted to the Northern Troubles as writers usually react to political events, by reaching defiantly for their artistic integrity. Rather than pen epics of the Bogside or sonnets of the Shankill, Irish authors are more likely to write essays on how the artistic imagination can't be vulgarly enlisted for political ends. And this may be all to the good. Writers are sometimes expected to speak out in a crisis; but since they are often an impractical, narcissistic, rampantly individualist bunch, allergic to analytical thought, it is hard to see quite why. The fantasies that fuel their art are also what unfit them for membership of the sanitation committee. What the Troubles have done, with grisly irony, is help put Ireland on the international map. There are healthier ways of going global, but the Irish have long been dab hands at the less desirable methods of attracting world attention, such as mass emigration. Hard on the heels of the Troubles prowled the Celtic Tiger, as an economic boom in the south of the island accompanied the steep decline of the north. This, too, bent the world's eye on this inconsiderable \"afterthought of Europe\", as Joyce called the place. For the first time in centuries, it was cool rather than corny to be Irish. English youth swarm over to Dublin for boozy weekends, while their elders holiday more sedately in the small towns of west Cork. The Irish had long been used to impressing the world more by their cultural products than their balance of trade or military hardware. But now this is happening on the cosmopolitan scale of Riverdance, U2 and Paddywood (the country's thriving film industry), rather than just at international James Joyce symposia. It is hardly surprising, then, that almost every English publisher now seems to want its Companion to Irish studies or Encyclopaedia of Eire. In the wake of both Troubles and Tiger had poured a torrential flood of Irish anthologies, cultural dictionaries and bluffer's guides. Among the finest of these on the literary front was Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland, a blockbuster of a book that he has now followed up with the equally door-stopping Irish Classics. Kiberd is a Dublin academic, but he has the talent for popularising of the public intellectual. Witty, astute, and compulsively readable, he knows how to shape a critical narrative and where to slide in a comic aside. This extravagantly ambitious book takes us all the way from the decline of the Irish bards in the early 17th century to the Belfast Agreement of 1998, pausing en route to discuss such luminaries as Swift, Sheridan, Burke, Wilde, Shaw, Synge, Flann O'Brien and a good deal besides. Since Kiberd is a fluent Irish speaker, we find interwoven with his accounts of the Anglophone literature of Ireland some richly rewarding dips into its Irish-language heritage: late bardic poets like D\u00e1ibhi \u00d3 Braudair and Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille, the remarkable 18th-century woman elegist Eibhl\u00edn Dhubh N\u00ed Chonailll, and the towering 20th-century Gaelic poet Sean \u00d3 R\u00edordain. For this was a land caught on the hop between cultures and identities, bereft of a single dominant tradition, compelled to make itself up as it went along. And that was one reason why, from Oscar Wilde to Samuel Beckett, it was to prove so hospitable to the experimental spirit of modernism. In the early 20th century, the only truly native modernism in the British isles sprang ironically from its most economically backward, politically turbulent region: Ireland. The English, by contrast, had to import most of their modernism from Europe and the US, as they import most of their cultural theory today. Like all Kiberd's writing, Irish Classics has an infectious verve about it that can lapse at times into a rather relentless up-beatness. He is happier at cheering than cursing, and finds it hard to makes seriously negative judgments on authors he admires. He does, however, have some attractively sceptical views on the old Gaelic social order, and impressively positive ones on W B Yeats - both unpredictable moves for one broadly in the nationalist camp. He also shrewdly criticises the way Richard Ellmann tended to see Irish authors as needing to transcend their Irishness in order to be great. Some of his other judgments are less sure-footed: W B Yeats hardly initiated the cult of the Big House, and it's far too simple-minded to see Burke as a stiff-necked English traditionalist with a big-hearted Paddy struggling to get out. Kiberd writes as though Burke was a Tory reactionary, rather than a Whig in an honourable 18th-century liberal tradition.

      "body": "<p>The millennium is the anniversary of an event that we no longer believe: namely, the birth of Almighty God in human form in a stable in Bethlehem. How, at this date in history could we possibly claim that Christianity was literally true? But those who were in the vanguard of destroying the Christian faith over the last 200 years were not a tiny handful of atheist philosophers and agnostic scientists. It was the Christians themselves. Christianity will decline yet further in the next 1,000 years to the point of near extinction - because Christians themselves no longer believe it to be true. </p> <p>If you went to a theological seminary, or a university where religion was being taught; if you went to a college where they were training ministers of the gospel; if you studied the Bible using the most searching and honest commentaries, written by men and women who devoted a lifetime of scholarship to the subject, you would find only a minority of these scholars professing old-fashioned, fully orthodox Christian beliefs. You would find that many of them were priests or ministers of their particular church. You would find that they attended the various rites of those churches. But ask them, \"Do you believe that God Almighty took human flesh in the person of Jesus?\" and I suspect you would find only a minority able to say an unambiguous \"Yes!\" </p> <p>Do they believe that Jesus was born in Bethlehem? Only a tiny handful of Bible scholars believe that. Fewer, I should guess, believe he was born of a virgin. Many would say that they believed in the Resurrection, but ask them to say whether they believe in the gospel accounts of an empty tomb, and you will find that they do not. </p> <p>You would, of course, find plenty of rabbis who interpret the Jewish scriptures in more or less the same way that rabbis were reading the Bible in the lifetime of Jesus. You would find nearly all Muslim scholars and imams reading the holy Koran in exactly the same sense as that in which it was written in the seventh century. That is because you can still have interesting, plausible arguments about God and morality, whereas so much of Christian myth is falsifiable. It makes truth claims that are not true. </p> <p>Christianity came to a crisis point 150 years ago when all these skeletons came out of its cupboard. German biblical scholars were taking the Bible to bits at just the moment when the scientists were casting doubt on the very idea of a Creator. Of course, you can still go on believing that there is a God after reading Darwin's Origin of Species. Darwin's discoveries did, however, for many earnest seekers after truth, remove any need to find purpose in nature or a mind behind the universe. Darwin revealed a process which was self-sufficient, which did not need a deus ex machina . Or indeed a deus - a god - of any kind. </p> <p>A remarkable fact about the history of English Christianity, and in particular of Anglicanism in the middle of the 20th century, was the large number of poets and novelists who explored the faith and its implications in their writings. Think of Dorothy L Sayers, Charles Williams, the CS Lewis of the science-fiction trilogy and Narnia (not the tub-thumping apologist of Mere Christianity), or Barbara Pym - all in their different ways exploring church or religious life on an imaginative scale which would have surprised their parents' agnostic generation. One remembers Ivy Compton-Burnett's impatience with her contemporary Rose Macaulay when she read her final novel, The Towers of Trebizond, and realised that Rose had returned to the faith. \"Why can't she remain a perfectly sensible agnostic like everyone else?\" </p> <p>Two writers stand out, to my mind, in this period who were most defiant in their refusal to be perfectly sensible agnostics: the first is TS Eliot, the second his sometime pupil, John Betjeman. </p> <p> If I think again of this place, <br> and of people, not wholly commendable, <br> Of no immediate kin or kindness, <br> But some particular genius, <br> All touched by a common genius, <br> United in the strife which divided them; <br> If I think of a king at nightfall, <br> of three men, and more, on the scaffold <br></p> <p>And a few who died forgotten <br> In other places, here and abroad, <br> and of one who died blind and quiet, <br> Why should we celebrate these dead men more than the dying? </p> <p>This is one of those resonant passages of The Four Quartets that must have thrilled the generation of Christians who first read it, as much as it dismayed those who felt that literature should move on, leaving this old baggage behind us. There will be many now, I suspect, to whom the lines are incomprehensible. </p> <p> \"We cannot restore old policies/ Or follow an antique drum\" becomes a prophecy which applies directly to the inner life of Eliot's own church - a church that seemed so alive when Betjeman was worshipping in it: </p> <p> Wonder beyond Time's wonders, <br> that Bread so white and small <br> Veiled in golden curtains, too mighty for men to see, <br> Is the Power which sends the shadows up this polychrome wall, <br> Is God who created the planet, the chain-smoking millions and me; <br> Beyond the throb of the engines is the throbbing heart of all - <br> Christ, at this Highbury altar, <br> I offer myself to Thee. </p> <p>It is impossible not to be moved by this poem. Equally, it is difficult to imagine anyone writing it nowadays, yet it was published only 50 years ago. Those of us who read the poetry of Milton without a grounding in classical literature are forever fumbling about in footnotes trying to find out where the fountain of Arethusa was. We're hardly reading - we are engaged in minor archaeology. No echoes occur. Eliot was trying to bring back, by means of pastiche architecture, the echoes of Dante, Shakespeare, Sanskrit and Mother Julian of Norwich into our common language so that we could speak with shared images and symbols. Without shared images and symbols, religion does not function. Nor does literature. Future generations will be deaf to both. </p> <p>Since the 19th century, there have been strides forward in the field of biblical scholarship, and this is something in which we can all rejoice. Inevitably it would lead to fresh translations of the Bible as new understanding emerged. But did it really necessitate the abolition of the 17th-century translation in its liturgical context? </p> <p>The church of Rome had been tinkering with its liturgy throughout the 20th century, altering the Easter ceremonies in ways barely noticeable to those who were not obsessives. But what can have possessed them to abolish the so-called Tridentine mass, a liturgy which was in essence 1,000 years older than the Council of Trent? Eager to show that it could be as modern as Rome, the Church of England, which had a perfectly good vernacular liturgy, and which had developed since 1928 a perfectly workable way of adding local variations to it, chose to concoct what is quite possibly the most disgracefully ugly, unmemorable liturgy devised in the history of the human race. </p> <p>It makes all its addresses to the Godhead seem like police statements read back to an unfortunate victim in the dock. \"From age to age you gathered a people to yourself_\" How inelegant, and how meaningless, to have changed the immemorial liturgical exchange \" Dominus Vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo \" into \" The Lord be with you. And also with you \". It recalls the exchanges of schoolchildren: \"The same to you with brass knobs on.\" </p> <p>Why did they do it? What blasphemous arrogance possessed them? Why did they think that their decades - the 1960s and 1970s - were so superior to anything that had gone before that they could uproot, change and uglify time-honoured liturgical routines which had sustained the generation of Queen Elizabeth, of Launcelot Andrews, and the Royal Martyr; of Pepys and Dryden and Queen Anne; of Dean Swift and Samuel Johnson; of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott (who was converted from presby-terianism by the liturgy alone); of the Victorian doubters, and those - Eliot, Betjeman and Rose Macaulay included - who in the 20th century returned blinking with amazement to the altar of God? </p> <p>In each case, what they returned to was the faith embodied in certain words which had always been adapted, modified and altered in small ways, but which remained fundamentally the same. The modernists called for the old symbols and words to be interpreted in ways which made sense to modern people. And in many cases, that meant not interpreting them at all. </p> <p>Most of us who have felt time spent in church was unwasted recall either moments of silence, or moments when music was playing. But utterly to change the words and the furniture! This removes the possibility of partaking in the one shared symbol. It introduces new and facile expressions that grate on the ear, and destroys one of the principal functions of liturgical recitations, whether of the scriptures or of the sacramental mystery - namely, that one generation passes on to the next the words and experiences of its predecessors. </p> <p> We are born with the dead: <br> See, they return, and bring us with them. <br> The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew tree <br> Are of equal duration. A people without history <br> Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern Of timeless moments... </p> <p>The liturgy was above all a pattern of timeless moments, daily repeated in quires and places where they sing. It was a far more important function of the church than Thought for the Day, or the woefully misdirected attempts to speak in the language of young people, or to teach imagined categories of being far beyond the ken of the average parson - such as ordinary people, or people in inner cities. The liturgy was for all sorts and conditions of people; its failure to attempt relevance was what made it timelessly and irreplaceably relevant. </p> <p>There is no point in Latin Mass Societies or Prayer Book Societies. Much as we sympathise with the die-hards and the nostalgic brigade, they are crying to the moon. The damage was done when common prayer ceased to be common prayer and when in the great western church, a unifying language - far more unifying than Esperanto, a truly universal tongue in which the human race could voice its deepest prayers and yearnings in a debased version of the language of the Caesars - was replaced by the Babel-sound of multilingual masses. </p> <p>How might faith be communicated to a future age, or how might it be understood imaginatively by writers? I don't see how it can be now, because its common language has been vandalised by the clergy. While the new Book of Common Worship, introduced this month, nominally contains some of the older liturgy for alternative use, one wonders how many clergymen will actually use it. We hate the clergy for this, and it is one of the reasons that many of us, who used to love the church, and who still love the old buildings and the ancient music, find that our affection for the institutional church has all but evaporated. </p> <p>I am talking about that Barbara Pymish love of all things churchy - it is hard to imagine many imaginative people sustaining it in the future. Her own diaries reflect the distress and disappointment felt by a pious woman in central London in search of unwrecked liturgy in her lunch hour. There was something so arrogant about the changes. They implied that we could throw away what had been for others the means of grace, the symbols of the ultimate mystery, and make up our own version. </p> <p>Typical of the ethos is the habit that came in, almost as soon as the liturgy changed, of spontaneous homilies being spoken after the gospel - as though the busy office worker in the middle of Norwich or Rome would want to hear five minutes of banal thoughts made up on the spur of the moment - rather than the old words, the tried and trusted words, the words which, worn and smooth like old, well-trodden stones, had been heard so often before and which had so often nourished and sustained, regardless of the doubts and dryness of those who heard them. </p> <p>I cannot see how Christianity can survive in anything like the form that previous generations of Christians, for the last 1950 years, would have recognised as Christian, now that it has departed from the concept of an orally transmitted faith. </p> <p>The leadership of the churches is dishonest. There is no other word for it - unless you add cowardly. They have been theologically educated. They know that concepts such as the physical resurrection and the virgin birth are not \"true\" as history. But they do not dare, even at the beginning of this new millennium, to rock the boat. As a result, nearly all of us stay outside the church and watch its decline with a mixture of sorrow and schadenfreude. What else does an organisation expect, which so consistently refuses to be intellectually serious? </p> <p>We come to church to be serious and we expect serious responses to the doubts and philosophical changes which have happened to all of us in the last 200 years. We do not expect kindergarten squabbles about miracles. Christianity invented a way of looking at human nature and the inner life which is part and parcel of our very civilisation. It invented the inner life - well, St Augustine in many ways invented the inner life. There is no need to believe in consciousness; many psychologists from William James onwards would say there was no such thing. There is no need to believe in individualism; the physicalist school of psychology/philosophy would discourage any such faith. Yet many of us feel that not to nourish these myths is to erode an important part of our self- consciousness not only as individuals, but as a society. </p> <p>The novel - the great expression of the idea that there are millions of people flitting about the planet being different from one another - derives directly from the Christian fiction of a soul. Christian artists are often those who have managed a synthesis of ideas which appear to destroy the old but actually invigorate it. Think of Dante, who almost single-handedly made Aquinas imaginatively accessible. Aquinas was the genius who fashioned the discoveries of Arab mathematics and logic, the writings of Averroes, the rediscovery of Aristotle - none of them compatible with Christian orthodoxies - into a new synthesis by which the human race could understand itself, talk to itself, for another 400 years. What happened in the 19th century was that no Aquinas arose, no Dante to absorb Darwinism, determinism, Freudianism, or Marxian materialism, or \"perfectly sensible agnosticism\". </p> <p>Now that the habit of learning the old Christian stories and prayers has all but died out, now that Christianity has turned itself back into a sect, there really seems to be no future. There will be Christians in the next generation, but we can be sadly certain that there will be no Christian literature - that came to an end with the generation of TS Eliot. </p> <p>Yet many human beings would still wish to echo the first great modern metaphysician, Immanuel Kant, when he said, \"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me, and the moral law within me.\" When all the mythologies of religion have been discarded and when all the false theories of Christianity have been exposed by patient and honest scholars, men and women of a reflective turn of mind will remain convinced that there is underlying the universe a deep moral purpose. Lose this sense of seriousness and life becomes unendurable. Most of us are too busy to follow the intricacies of Kant's philosophical journeying, but we believe these things in our gut. There is a religion that satisfies this deep human need for a moral code without a mythology. It is not Christianity. </p> <p>The mullahs and the imams of Islam preach the same undiluted message which was first given to the world by the Holy Prophet in the sixth and seventh centuries. While the west tries to dub the followers of Islam fundamentalist lunatics, increasing numbers of people turn to the Koran and find in this book what they have always craved: a moral and an intellectual acknowledgement of the lordship of God without the encumbrance of Christian mythological baggage in which almost no one really believes. That is why Christianity will decline in this millennium, and the next religious hunger of the human heart will be answered by the Crescent, not by the Cross. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from AN Wilson's essay Christianity and Modernity, which appears in Ink and Spirit: Literature and Spirituality, edited by Stephen Platten, published by Canterbury Press, price \u00a38.99.

There will be many now, I suspect, to whom the lines are incomprehensible. \"We cannot restore old policies/ Or follow an antique drum\" becomes a prophecy which applies directly to the inner life of Eliot's own church - a church that seemed so alive when Betjeman was worshipping in it: Wonder beyond Time's wonders, that Bread so white and small Veiled in golden curtains, too mighty for men to see, Is the Power which sends the shadows up this polychrome wall, Is God who created the planet, the chain-smoking millions and me; Beyond the throb of the engines is the throbbing heart of all - Christ, at this Highbury altar, I offer myself to Thee. It is impossible not to be moved by this poem. Equally, it is difficult to imagine anyone writing it nowadays, yet it was published only 50 years ago. Those of us who read the poetry of Milton without a grounding in classical literature are forever fumbling about in footnotes trying to find out where the fountain of Arethusa was. We're hardly reading - we are engaged in minor archaeology. No echoes occur. Eliot was trying to bring back, by means of pastiche architecture, the echoes of Dante, Shakespeare, Sanskrit and Mother Julian of Norwich into our common language so that we could speak with shared images and symbols. Without shared images and symbols, religion does not function. Nor does literature. Future generations will be deaf to both. Since the 19th century, there have been strides forward in the field of biblical scholarship, and this is something in which we can all rejoice. Inevitably it would lead to fresh translations of the Bible as new understanding emerged. But did it really necessitate the abolition of the 17th-century translation in its liturgical context? The church of Rome had been tinkering with its liturgy throughout the 20th century, altering the Easter ceremonies in ways barely noticeable to those who were not obsessives. But what can have possessed them to abolish the so-called Tridentine mass, a liturgy which was in essence 1,000 years older than the Council of Trent? Eager to show that it could be as modern as Rome, the Church of England, which had a perfectly good vernacular liturgy, and which had developed since 1928 a perfectly workable way of adding local variations to it, chose to concoct what is quite possibly the most disgracefully ugly, unmemorable liturgy devised in the history of the human race. It makes all its addresses to the Godhead seem like police statements read back to an unfortunate victim in the dock. \"From age to age you gathered a people to yourself_\" How inelegant, and how meaningless, to have changed the immemorial liturgical exchange \" Dominus Vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo \" into \" The Lord be with you. And also with you \". It recalls the exchanges of schoolchildren: \"The same to you with brass knobs on.\" Why did they do it? What blasphemous arrogance possessed them? Why did they think that their decades - the 1960s and 1970s - were so superior to anything that had gone before that they could uproot, change and uglify time-honoured liturgical routines which had sustained the generation of Queen Elizabeth, of Launcelot Andrews, and the Royal Martyr; of Pepys and Dryden and Queen Anne; of Dean Swift and Samuel Johnson; of Coleridge and Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott (who was converted from presby-terianism by the liturgy alone); of the Victorian doubters, and those - Eliot, Betjeman and Rose Macaulay included - who in the 20th century returned blinking with amazement to the altar of God? In each case, what they returned to was the faith embodied in certain words which had always been adapted, modified and altered in small ways, but which remained fundamentally the same. The modernists called for the old symbols and words to be interpreted in ways which made sense to modern people. And in many cases, that meant not interpreting them at all. Most of us who have felt time spent in church was unwasted recall either moments of silence, or moments when music was playing. But utterly to change the words and the furniture! This removes the possibility of partaking in the one shared symbol. It introduces new and facile expressions that grate on the ear, and destroys one of the principal functions of liturgical recitations, whether of the scriptures or of the sacramental mystery - namely, that one generation passes on to the next the words and experiences of its predecessors. We are born with the dead: See, they return, and bring us with them. The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew tree Are of equal duration. A people without history Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern Of timeless moments... The liturgy was above all a pattern of timeless moments, daily repeated in quires and places where they sing. It was a far more important function of the church than Thought for the Day, or the woefully misdirected attempts to speak in the language of young people, or to teach imagined categories of being far beyond the ken of the average parson - such as ordinary people, or people in inner cities. The liturgy was for all sorts and conditions of people; its failure to attempt relevance was what made it timelessly and irreplaceably relevant. There is no point in Latin Mass Societies or Prayer Book Societies. Much as we sympathise with the die-hards and the nostalgic brigade, they are crying to the moon. The damage was done when common prayer ceased to be common prayer and when in the great western church, a unifying language - far more unifying than Esperanto, a truly universal tongue in which the human race could voice its deepest prayers and yearnings in a debased version of the language of the Caesars - was replaced by the Babel-sound of multilingual masses. How might faith be communicated to a future age, or how might it be understood imaginatively by writers? I don't see how it can be now, because its common language has been vandalised by the clergy. While the new Book of Common Worship, introduced this month, nominally contains some of the older liturgy for alternative use, one wonders how many clergymen will actually use it. We hate the clergy for this, and it is one of the reasons that many of us, who used to love the church, and who still love the old buildings and the ancient music, find that our affection for the institutional church has all but evaporated. I am talking about that Barbara Pymish love of all things churchy - it is hard to imagine many imaginative people sustaining it in the future. Her own diaries reflect the distress and disappointment felt by a pious woman in central London in search of unwrecked liturgy in her lunch hour. There was something so arrogant about the changes. They implied that we could throw away what had been for others the means of grace, the symbols of the ultimate mystery, and make up our own version. Typical of the ethos is the habit that came in, almost as soon as the liturgy changed, of spontaneous homilies being spoken after the gospel - as though the busy office worker in the middle of Norwich or Rome would want to hear five minutes of banal thoughts made up on the spur of the moment - rather than the old words, the tried and trusted words, the words which, worn and smooth like old, well-trodden stones, had been heard so often before and which had so often nourished and sustained, regardless of the doubts and dryness of those who heard them. I cannot see how Christianity can survive in anything like the form that previous generations of Christians, for the last 1950 years, would have recognised as Christian, now that it has departed from the concept of an orally transmitted faith. The leadership of the churches is dishonest. There is no other word for it - unless you add cowardly. They have been theologically educated. They know that concepts such as the physical resurrection and the virgin birth are not \"true\" as history. But they do not dare, even at the beginning of this new millennium, to rock the boat. As a result, nearly all of us stay outside the church and watch its decline with a mixture of sorrow and schadenfreude. What else does an organisation expect, which so consistently refuses to be intellectually serious? We come to church to be serious and we expect serious responses to the doubts and philosophical changes which have happened to all of us in the last 200 years. We do not expect kindergarten squabbles about miracles. Christianity invented a way of looking at human nature and the inner life which is part and parcel of our very civilisation. It invented the inner life - well, St Augustine in many ways invented the inner life. There is no need to believe in consciousness; many psychologists from William James onwards would say there was no such thing. There is no need to believe in individualism; the physicalist school of psychology/philosophy would discourage any such faith. Yet many of us feel that not to nourish these myths is to erode an important part of our self- consciousness not only as individuals, but as a society. The novel - the great expression of the idea that there are millions of people flitting about the planet being different from one another - derives directly from the Christian fiction of a soul. Christian artists are often those who have managed a synthesis of ideas which appear to destroy the old but actually invigorate it. Think of Dante, who almost single-handedly made Aquinas imaginatively accessible. Aquinas was the genius who fashioned the discoveries of Arab mathematics and logic, the writings of Averroes, the rediscovery of Aristotle - none of them compatible with Christian orthodoxies - into a new synthesis by which the human race could understand itself, talk to itself, for another 400 years. What happened in the 19th century was that no Aquinas arose, no Dante to absorb Darwinism, determinism, Freudianism, or Marxian materialism, or \"perfectly sensible agnosticism\". Now that the habit of learning the old Christian stories and prayers has all but died out, now that Christianity has turned itself back into a sect, there really seems to be no future. There will be Christians in the next generation, but we can be sadly certain that there will be no Christian literature - that came to an end with the generation of TS Eliot. Yet many human beings would still wish to echo the first great modern metaphysician, Immanuel Kant, when he said, \"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me, and the moral law within me.\" When all the mythologies of religion have been discarded and when all the false theories of Christianity have been exposed by patient and honest scholars, men and women of a reflective turn of mind will remain convinced that there is underlying the universe a deep moral purpose. Lose this sense of seriousness and life becomes unendurable. Most of us are too busy to follow the intricacies of Kant's philosophical journeying, but we believe these things in our gut. There is a religion that satisfies this deep human need for a moral code without a mythology. It is not Christianity. The mullahs and the imams of Islam preach the same undiluted message which was first given to the world by the Holy Prophet in the sixth and seventh centuries. While the west tries to dub the followers of Islam fundamentalist lunatics, increasing numbers of people turn to the Koran and find in this book what they have always craved: a moral and an intellectual acknowledgement of the lordship of God without the encumbrance of Christian mythological baggage in which almost no one really believes. That is why Christianity will decline in this millennium, and the next religious hunger of the human heart will be answered by the Crescent, not by the Cross. \u0095 This is an edited extract from AN Wilson's essay Christianity and Modernity, which appears in Ink and Spirit: Literature and Spirituality, edited by Stephen Platten, published by Canterbury Press, price \u00a38.99.

      "body": "<p><strong> November 23 1999. Berlin</strong> </p> <p>We're on to a new episode, a new director and crew: Brecht and Beckett, and their influence. I haven't been in Berlin since just after the Wall came down. \"Berlin is a pile of rubble next to Potsdam,\" was how Brecht found it when he returned to live in the eastern sector in 1947. To see the re-unified Berlin is a shock: the monotonous, doughy bleakness of the east has been replaced by a show of capitalism as propagandist as anything that communism ever perpetrated; at the corner of the Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse, at the heart of the eastern part, there is now a car showroom displaying the latest Bentley with as much swagger as ever a statue of Lenin was displayed. </p> <p><strong> November 24</strong> </p> <p>Berlin is a building site, and we film on a terrace of the Reichstag: it's surrounded by industrial cranes - 20 or 30, a herd of them, like long-necked, long-headed dinosaurs. The building has been beautifully converted by Norman Foster, and at its core is the metaphor made literal - it's possible to look down from the upturned sugar bowl of the cupola at the parliament: transparent government. The most moving part of the conversion is the preservation of the graffiti left by Russian soldiers when they occupied the building at the end of the second world war: triumphalist messages in cyrillic script, burnt with candle flame on to the stonework. </p> <p>Berlin is \"forever in the process of becoming, and never in the state of being\", said a 19th-century art critic, who was buried in the same cemetery as Brecht, along with Schinkel, the architect responsible for much of the process of becoming, not to mention Hegel, Heinrich Mann, Brecht's wife - Helene Weigel - and many of his collaborators. Brecht's gravestone has no date, but the grave is scattered with votive offerings: fresh wreaths, potatoes with a topping of snow, a rose in a shell-case, a cigar butt. </p> <p>He lived beside the graveyard. We film his house: from the front you might think it's a small block of working-class flats, from the back it's a bourgeois villa. \"It reflects his character,\" says our translator, Angelika, tartly. His rooms are pleasant and peaceful. I put my overcoat on a chair. \"Don't put it there please,\" says the curator. \"It's an old piece of furniture.\" And nice, too: simple and elegant, a desk where he could stand to write, a table for typing - his typewriter, a Royal, \"Quiet de Luxe\". Chinese wall-hangings, Chinese theatre masks, a life mask of himself, no paintings, but a few photos: Lenin, Marx and an unrecognisably young Engels. </p> <p>The bookshelves contain a huge and eclectic selection ranging from leather-bound Shakespeare and Schiller, philosophy, science, novels, to paperback thrillers (in English), such as Stone Cold Blonde: The Case of the Nude Beauty's Corpse and Somerset Maugham's Liza of Lambeth. There are several feet of shelves of the Complete Lenin, Marx, Engels and Hegel, which he took with him in exile to Denmark and Los Angeles. We look at his manuscript of Galileo, scrawled over by Charles Laughton and by Brecht. A correction of tense from conditional to subjunctive convinces me that his English was much better than he let on. </p> <p>I look at his copy (in German) of Waiting for Godot. Like the irrepressible auteur he was, he's made large cuts and written in suggested rewrites. He planned to do a production in which scenes of world revolution would have been projected behind the characters on a cyclorama. </p> <p>For all the asceticism of his work and the austerity of his ideology, the copious photographs of him show a man who loved to be pictured, in clothes that prefigured Maoist chic - good leather, good tweed - who allegedly shaved through muslin to cultivate designer stubble. By the time of his death at the age of 58, he was rotting from within, corrupted by bad faith and political compromise; he'd had a heart attack, and was depressed by a recent statement from Stalin about how all art had to be social realism. </p> <p>But also, as the curator says, \"he had too much smoking, and did not give time for sporting activities\". We film in the cell-like bedroom where he died: a small truckle bed, more thrillers, Arthur Waley's Chinese poems, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and a copy of the New York Herald Tribune by the bedside. He died an Austrian citizen with a Swiss bank account. </p> <p>We go downstairs to a surprisingly pleasant restaurant (menu including dishes from Helene Weigel's recipe book), papered with wonderful photos of Brecht and his women, and several exquisite model boxes of sets designed by Caspar Neher. Brecht's lasting gift to the theatre was in his staging: clarity, simplicity, realism. They look as if they were designed yesterday. </p> <p><strong> November 24 </strong> </p> <p>We drive to Dresden - two and a half hours (extended to four by a characteristically horrendous accident) to film a Caspar David Friedrich painting. Dresden has been miraculously restored, but still bears the half-healed scars of the fire-bombing, sandstone scorched the colour of pitch. It also bears the marks of a new assault from the west: McDonald's, Toys R Us, Holiday Inn. The Friedrich painting is called Two Men Observing the Moon, and shows two men standing by the trunk of a curved bare tree, looking at a golden misty moon. It's one of the few clues that Beckett ever gave away to his work - he said it had inspired Waiting for Godot: each act of Godot ends with two men and a rising moon. </p> <p><strong> November 25</strong> </p> <p>We film the exterior of Brecht's theatre, home of the Berliner Ensemble. It's an enviably beautiful baroque theatre - theatrical revolutions always prosper when there's a tension between the innovation on stage and the decor of the auditorium: the Royal Court, the Old Vic, the Aldwych, the Bouffe du Nord. Seeing the theatre, I'm a little less confident of condemning Brecht for having endorsed the Stalinist regime and been rewarded with his own theatre: a ghastly kitsch statue of Brecht outside is his perpetual punishment. </p> <p>Like every other building in Berlin, the theatre's having a refit, in preparation for a new season under a new director, who is, daringly, not opening with a play by Brecht; it's just about him. We drive an hour out of Berlin to Wannsee: deserted oak woods surround a glassy lake, a ferry crosses, a solitary canoeist paddles into the distance. Silence. Sunset. Clouds rake across a sky the colour of a dying bruise. In a large, handsome house beside this lake, the Final Solution was planned. </p> <p><strong> November 30</strong> </p> <p>Paris, in search of Beckett. He went from Trinity College, Dublin, to study at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the polishing ground for the cream of France's intelligentsia. We film outside the gates as students stream out, all of them looking as if they would comfortably fit into an Eric Rohmer film. But come to that, I would too: a greying middle-aged man in black overcoat hanging around young girls. </p> <p>Beckett's flat from the 60s until his death was in a post-war, art deco-ish block on a wide boulevard bisected by the above-ground metro, next to a Christian Science church on one side, a supermarket on the other. I don't know what I'd expected - a thin, austere, 19th-century garret, I suppose. We film the bar he used to favour, just off the Boulevard Montparnasse. It's a pub which advertises Guinness and Kilkenny ales and about 300 Belgian beers, where a homesick football fan might end up. But there aren't any; they're all native beer and whisky lovers. There's no relic or memorabilia of Beckett, but there is an Orson Welles room - is it because he played Falstaff or because he drank there? </p> <p>For the playwright whose subject is despair and inertia, Beckett seems to have had a remarkably active life - he played first-class cricket, he had numerous love affairs, he was stabbed, he joined the Resistance during the war, he evaded the Gestapo, and he was convivial company. All the people I know, and there are many, who \"had a drink with Sam\" speak of him with great warmth. Nothing is as one expects from the gaunt, reclusive, melancholic persona that we infer from the plays, but why should it be? It's only celebrity interviewers who expect the work to be like the man. </p> <p>We film in the street where he was stabbed by a pimp, who just missed his heart. There is a black cat in the street. We ask his owner, an old woman, if we can use the cat to add a Third Man touch to the sequence. \"You must ask him,\" she says.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Eyre's Changing Stages continues on BBC 2 tomorrow at 7.30pm.</p>",

The author of 13 bestselling novels featuring the character of Inspector Morse, Dexter won the Crime Writers' Association Diamond Dagger in 1997 for his contribution to the art. He was awarded an OBE this year, and has now written his final Morse book, The Remorseful Day, in which our hero is dies of a heart attack. He is married with two children, and lives in Oxford. What is your idea of perfect happiness? 'A jug of wine, a book of verse and Thou beside me.' When and where were you happiest? Teaching Latin and Greek in Corby, Northants, from 1959 to 1966. What is your greatest fear? A toss up between rats and spiders. With which historical figure do you most identify? Edward Gibbon, for the vast capacity of his mind and wonder of his prose. Which living person do you most admire? Nelson Mandela - for his idealism, courage and lack of bitterness. What do you consider the most overrated virtue? Confidence.

The will to win at all costs. What is your favourite book? Bleak House. What is your favourite fantasy? England winning the Ashes. How did you vote in the last general election? Labour. How will you vote in the next election? I am congenitally incapable of voting for the Tories. What or who is the greatest love of your life? The 'what' would be poetry; the 'who', my wife Dorothy. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? If so, I must have been intoxicated. What is your greatest regret? My earlier belief that persons in high positions were necessarily competent. What would your motto be? Have the courage of your own weaknesses. How would you like to die? 'To cease upon the midnight with no pain' (although I'm not particularly keen on the idea in general).

      "body": "<p>When Terry Jones was seven years old he wrote: \"I'm hopping to be an actor.\" In a career that includes five years of Monty Python's Flying Circus, he has certainly fulfilled that hope. But he's also been a director, producer and, increasingly, a writer. \"I now think that saying I wanted to be an actor was a kind of shorthand. What I've always wanted to do, is write. Writing is the beginning of everything.\" </p> <p>Terry Jones's study feels and looks like a writer's room. His laptop is dwarfed by an enormous tome of historical documents: he's working on research for a book on Chaucer's death. And, he's just published The Knight and his Lady, his second book about Tom, a young squire in the Middle Ages. </p> <p>He began to write for children when his daughter Sally was five. \"I thought it would be nice to read her some fairy tales. I started reading Grimm's 'Snow White' and when it got to the end I had to read out about how the wicked step-mother got punished by having to dance in the red-hot slippers until she fell down dead. I didn't like the idea of my little five-year-old going to sleep thinking 'I'm so glad they tortured that old woman to death', so I thought: 'Maybe I'll have a go.'\" </p> <p>With a week off from working on Ripping Yarns with Michael Palin, Jones sat down to write. \"I'd never written a story before and I wrote two in the first day, and read them out to Sally when she came home from nursery. She seemed to like them so that encouraged me. </p> <p>\"I'd always liked myth, especially stories like 'The Emperor's New Clothes'. Any kid can understand it and yet it's got a very sophisticated political message. I wanted to be simple and mythic and I knew the stories had to be concise, probably because of writing for television.\" </p> <p>Soon he had produced 30 stories, but getting them published was not quite so simple. Having teamed up with illustrator Michael Foreman, he sent them off to a publisher and went off to shoot The Life of Brian. Nothing happened. Then another publisher, who was was setting up on his own, stepped in. \"He asked if I would like to be the first novel on the list, alongside a book of drawings by Paul McCartney.\" </p> <p>Like everything else he does, Jones's writing for children is witty, original and entertaining. And, because after Sally there came Bill, and Jones believes in fair play, he set about writing a book for him. Bill wanted it to be about Vikings. </p> <p>Jones was familiar with the Viking sagas because he'd looked into them as material for Python. Unfortunately, what he'd found was that they were rather boring. \"I hadn't quite realised how pedestrian they were. I'd thought they'd be full of mystery and adventure. His own Saga of Erik the Viking was \"what I'd always hoped the sagas were\". </p> <p>Weaving together the different strands of his work comes readily to Jones, who moves freely between performing, directing, writing screenplays of other people's books, writing his own books and researching. </p> <p>\"I've always liked writing and it seemed to come fairly easily. It's very different, and much more fun than writing sketches. Sketches are just lines. It's hard to tell whether they're funny or not.\" Writing a book is more of an adventure, he says. \"I don't plan anything out, so if I'm in the middle of writing anything, I can't wait to get to my desk to find out what happens next.\" </p> <p>But, despite the absence of a plan, he is very aware of his audience. Having known exactly who he was writing his first two children's books for, he ran into trouble with his third, Nicobobinus, until he found another child he could write for. \"The thing about being a writer is that there is a very intimate bond with the reader because there is nothing in between. When you're reading a book in bed it's like having somebody whispering in your ear. With film or TV it's all to do with interpretation, so there's a lot between you and the original. You're not coming into contact with one mind.\" </p> <p>To get back to being that one voice, Jones thought he'd recycle the research he had done for TV programmes on the crusades for another book. \"The trouble was that I didn't really know enough about the 11th century, so I updated to the 14th and used my Chaucer research instead.\" </p> <p>The result was The Knight and His Squire, a terrific adventure with robust characters and tremendous drama. It is told by young Tom speaking directly to his present-day contemporaries. The result is a refreshingly accessible historical novel, full of information but not weighed down by card-index detail. </p> <p>By now writing entirely for his own entertainment, Jones ended it up in the air, meaning to come back and finish the story. After a long break, when he was diverted into dubbing Gerard Depardieu's Obelix and Asterix into English, he finally got round to the sequel, The Squire and His Lady. The research this time involved an extended tour through France with illustrator Michael Foreman, following the route of Edward III's army to the Pope's palace in Avignon. </p> <p>Jones's interest in accuracy extends to details of food and drink and the identifiction of the first flushing toilet as much as to campaigns, intrigues and battles. His enthusiasm is contagious. Let him go on whispering in our ears. It's a story everyone will enjoy. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501216908,00.html\">Buy The Kinght and the Squire at BOL</a></p>",

Historically the conflict has always been between an exclusive ethnic Ulster Catholic nationalism incapable of extending Irishness to include Protestants, and a doggedly anti-papist Protestantism that, after the Northern state was established, preserved ownership by systematically excluding Catholics from every institution. </p> <p>Between these stood \"the Brits\", always available, says Elliott, to satisfy Ulster Catholics' psychological need to blame someone else besides themselves for their plight.

Two-thirds of the book treats Ulster before partition, though the narrative's seamless move from nine-county Ulster to the six-county state surely implies a greater degree of British involvement in the conflict than Elliott allows. </p> <p>Cherished elements of Irish nationalist historiography are aggressively dismissed. The main grievance of Catholics during the Plantations, Elliott claims, was not the loss of land: it was the loss of land to Johnny-come-lately Protestants, with all the dilution of social prestige that involved in an intensely status-conscious society. Simmering Catholic resentment at this loss of status to \"heretics\" was always easily provoked by displays of Protestant imperiousness, so that minor neighbourly feuds could be viciously transformed by these deeply rooted historical animosities. </p> <p>Throughout the book, Elliott makes the plain but powerful point that, though the Plantations and the Penal laws may be misunderstood and simplified by Ulster Catholics, they did happen. The suffering of Ulster Catholics is not, as Unionists have too often claimed, wholly fabricated. </p> <p>But too many Ulster Catholics, she argues, remain stuck in an identity grounded in these grievances. Quiet suffering for the faith and the noble endurance of the Protestant and British presence - the accumulation of spiritual capital through forbearance - has substituted for the practical advantages that a secular Catholic leadership working within the state might have achieved. Elliott blames the Catholic hierarchy and the leadership of the Orange state equally for this alienation, and this is true. But some analysis of the British and indeed the Republic of Ireland's involvement in the process might have provided a relevant additional dimension. </p> <p>Elliot's frustration at the \"terrible circularity\" in Northern Ireland's political rhetoric is evident throughout. Where Nationalists say they cannot give loyalty to a state that is anti-Catholic, loyalists withhold full citizenship because Catholics are generically disloyal. </p> <p>Effectively abandoned by the Republic after it gained independence, and deprived access to the Northern state's institutions, Catholics came to regard their religion as a badge of defiance.

Enniskillen and countless other IRA atrocities provoked a rethink of what inherited anti-British resentment might actually entail. If disliking the Brits meant permanent opposition to the state in which, for better or worse, they lived, stability and progress seemed permanently off the agenda. In Elliott's reading, the Good Friday agreement becomes one more attempt to reveal the essentially regional nature of the dispute between two communities dependent on each other for much of their identity. </p> <p>This is an honest and important book, one that deserves a wide and careful readership. Formidable learning and scholarly endeavour (the notes run to 80 pages) are carried, for the most part, lightly. Marianne Elliott's evident impatience with the \"pettiness\" of much Catholic, nationalist culture, the crippling effects of its residual all-Ireland instincts, won't endear her to everyone. But Ulster Catholics' claim on Irishness is in fact no more or less sentimental or needy than claiming to be British, or English or Welsh or Scottish.

In Prodigal Summer she returns in a sense to her own back yard, although her marvellously subtle and compelling tale of a southern Appalachian farming community in tense interplay with the wilderness on its doorstep contains a deft parable of humankind's place in nature. </p> <p>The novel alternates between three stories whose links gradually emerge, in a tiny community of 600 people where, as one perplexed newcomer remarks: \"Everybody within 16 miles of here is uncle or cousin to you someways.\" From a mountain log cabin, Deanna Wolfe, a 47-year-old biologist with a \"hillbilly accent\" and a serious education, scours National Forest land for poachers while keeping fond tabs on the coyotes new to her territory. The divorcee's two-year solitude is disturbed by Eddie Bondo, a rifle-toting Wyoming sheep rancher some 20 years her junior, for whom \"hating coyotes is my religion\", yet who draws her into an irresistible, ambivalent affair. </p> <p>Down in the valley, in Deanna's hometown of Egg Fork, Lusa Landowski, a city-born entomologist and newly widowed, clings to an epiphany of her husband, Cole Widener: she sees their love, carried in the scent of honeysuckle across a field, as akin to the language of moths, which navigate by sense of smell. As Lusa battles with the harsh maths of subsistence farming to rear goats rather than harvest tobacco on her late husband's land, she grows closer to her five seemingly hostile sisters-in-law and their maverick children, while evading the attentions of their menfolk. </p> <p>In the third thread, the elderly Garnett Walker toils to revive the American chestnut tree, made extinct by loggers and fungal blight, while warring with his neighbour, Nannie Rawley. Left in \"terror of chemicals\" partly by the birth of a Down's syndrome daughter who died young, Nannie enforces a \"no-spray zone\" around her organic orchard. </p> <p>The three women protagonists have in common their independence - ranging from Deanna's unselfconsciousness to Lusa's faltering self-sufficiency - and an intuitive regard for nature, backed up by superior education. Kingsolver, a former biologist and journalist, has a rare ability to communicate widely what she knows as a scientist, and this novel sounds warnings against hunting predators who compensate by breeding faster, or against pesticides that boost pest populations by killing off the bugs that prey on them. The ecosystem reestablishing itself in the protected forest is seen as a common habitat, not a wilderness to be kept at bay from the farmland. As Deanna says of hunting coyote: \"It's not just one death. It's a piece of the world turned upside down.\" </p> <p>This is a novel that insists on the shared animality of humans, regardless of their efforts to subdue nature. That the world is \"a place with its own immutable rules of hunger and satisfaction\" is clear in the novel's erotic undertow amid the spring fecundity of lavishly described woodlands, and in the characters' human desires, not only for sex, but to mark their territory, for progeny (the elders grieve at the prospect of growing old \"without young ones to treasure coming up after you\"), even for food; disavowing any sentimental attachment to fluffy animals, Deanna relishes meat, saying \"I know a little too much about animals to try to deny what I am\". She is amazed by \"the obvious animal facts people refused to know about their kind\", such as that women exposed to enough moonlight will ovulate at full moon, or that pheremones announce their periodic fertility to men. Smells, says Lusa, who sniffs her absent husband in strange men's work clothes, are \"a whole world of love we don't discuss\". In a pointed irony, assiduous sperm get the better of Eddie's impressive array of prophylactics. </p> <p>Although insistence on human biology has been used conservatively, to limit rather than liberate women, Kingsolver's view of nature is no endorsement of the nuclear family. Not only do her women glory in single motherhood, but like the packs of sister coyotes that nurture an alpha female's young, Lusa's sisters-in-law prepare to adopt the children of a sister who has cancer. Nor does the novel deny individuality; the tomboyishness of Lusa's niece, Crystal, is less a sexual imperative than \"just her way of trying to be herself\". </p> <p>Although Deanna imagines herself close to nature, as she forgets how to converse or read people's faces, the novel stresses human gregariousness and interdependence. \"Solitude is a human presumption,\" it says, \"a long process of coming undone from oneself\", to which pregnancy and motherhood may be a corrective. While small-town gossip and claustrophobia are evoked through Garnett's back-biting pettiness and sensitivity to imagined slights, the Appalachian \"hillbillies\" (who pronounce \"hell\" to rhyme with \"hail\") are humanised not ridiculed, falling back on each other in hard times. Lusa realises: \"You had to be so careful with large families. Who knew how things would turn around, who you'd need in the end?\" Or as Nettie notes wisely: \"There's always more to a story than a body can see from the fence line.\" </p> <p>Most of the boundaries delineated in this novel are seen to erode: between wilderness and cultivation, human and animal, society and individual.\"People just adore fences, but Nature doesn't give a hoot,\" says Nettie, as barriers among neighbours or family members crumble. But Kingsolver's world perhaps divides too easily into male and female: between the women protectively in tune with nature, and the male hunters and farmers who strive to tame it. The men are simply wrong; they change and are embraced, or stand firm and are rejected. Conviction can tip into righteousness as the fiction rams home a message at the expense of dialogue. </p> <p>Yet the novel is carried by its more tentative truths about human nature, and the subtler revelations of its interior lives, as the characters experience passion, widowhood, menopause, pregnancy, adoption, bereavement. Often funny, and only occasionally teetering into schmaltz with the elderly couple, Prodigal Summer is a rich and compulsive read. Its acute and sensuous observation of the natural world reveals an unexpected beauty, as it traces human love in the flight of a luna moth.</p>",

The veteran writer triumphed over critical ambivalence to win the $10,000 National Book Award for In America, which, like the Booker, was staunchly defended against charges of being a lifetime achievement award. Glad that misapprehension has been cleared up then. \u0095 Meanwhile, Canongate's year continues in fortuitous fashion, their authors Laura Hird and Michel Faber making up half the shortlist for the recently announced Whitbread First Novel Award. For Faber, scooping the prize would be the icing on the cake - Under the Skin has already been optioned by Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon's film company. As for the Whitbread, all bets are off: trainee bridesmaid Zadie Smith also lurks in the wings. We'll know in January. \u0095 Whispers reach the Loafer that some participants in this year's Word Festival in September are a tad disenchanted. Complaints include writers who only learnt of their forthcoming appearance from kindly friends, and a certain sluggishness over the reimbursement of expenses. It's one way of tightening those purse-strings, we suppose.",

David Cavanagh now had an ending for his book. Doubtless conceived as an orthodox rags-to-riches account of how Alan McGee's stewardship of the most celebrated independent record label in the world took him from a Glasgow housing scheme to 10 Downing Street, accruing vast wealth and narcotic-fuelled notoriety along the way, Cavanagh's project got overtaken by events. </p> <p>Most obvious of these was the souring of Creation's always problematic relationship with its prized asset Oasis, but the book's gestation also coincided with the British music industry's slide into recession and McGee's disillusionment with what his company - and by definition he himself - had become. </p> <p>Moreover, in the course of three years of research, the author glimpsed a bigger picture: that Creation's rise and fall was a metaphor, not just for the unfeasibility of true independence in a corporate era, but for social and cultural changes in Britain over the last 25 years, in which the adversarial post-war certainties of \"them and us\" were replaced by an uneasy new consensus based on unfettered materialism and the co-option of art by commerce. For all New Labour's self-serving attempts to claim him, Cavanagh suggests that the intuitively left-wing McGee is really a vindication of the Thatcherite era, and consequently riven with confused impulses. </p> <p> My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize transcends the parochial concerns of most rock biographies, although it comes steeped in them too. Indeed, the strength of this well-written book is in the details. The tale begins with a richly evocative depiction of mid-1970s Glasgow, a wasteland in many aspects but especially for disgruntled punk zealots like the young Alan McGee, who unsuccessfully auditioned for a formative version of Simple Minds before taking a mundane job as a British Rail stores clerk. </p> <p>Where less assiduous biographers might have jumped straight for the hedonistic jugular, Cavanagh dwells on these bleak times, following McGee down to London and charting his fervent efforts to stir life into the capital's moribund music scene. \"The key to understanding Alan McGee is not the years when he roared with vindication,\" he explains. \"It is the decades of disappointment and frustration that went before.\" </p> <p>Throughout, Cavanagh's wry, unsensational tone imposes much-needed perspective upon the mania that informed Creation's mission to wreak pop-art havoc upon the music establishment. Gorging on the book's anecdotal feast, one struggles to comprehend not only how Creation survived its hand-to-mouth existence long enough to become a potent force, but just how its cast of eccentrics, egotists and sociopaths eventually triumphed in such a brutal environment without one of them dying. </p> <p>Not that they didn't come close. The House of Love's swift disintegration from potential superstars into basket cases who spent \u00a310,000 in a year on taxi fares is played out with excruciating fastidiousness, while McGee's own drugged-up arrogance would be funny were it not for the dreadful personal price it eventually exacted. \"McGee took so much cocaine that his behaviour became Napoleonic,\" writes Cavanagh of a visit to New York in 1993. \"He threatened to beat up the concierge in his hotel when the plastic door-key to his room didn't work (until he realised he was on the wrong floor).\" </p> <p>Coupled with the phenomenal success of Oasis, McGee's 1994 nervous breakdown is presented as the catalyst for Creation adopting more conventional business practices, thereby losing the anarchic energy on which its aesthetic had thrived, and setting in motion a series of events that resulted in its eventual demise. Cavanagh reveals internal politicking worthy of Millbank, painting the sober McGee as gentler but no less paranoid, an increasingly distant figure, ill-at-ease with the market-led impulses of the new quasi-corporate company, although perfectly happy to accept the accompanying financial benefits. </p> <p>Ever prone to short-sighted outbursts of hubris, McGee has already denounced My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize as \"the accountant's tale\", presumably because it represents him in an inconveniently candid light. And possibly also because Cavanagh has chosen to put Creation into its proper context, as merely the latest in a series of maverick attempts to take on the corporate music business, which happened to succeed (for a while) thanks to a combination of luck, Oasis and the sheer bloody-minded determination of its founder to persevere where others had given up. Creation was a definitive rock'n'roll fable, a story of high art and low cunning. Thanks to David Cavanagh, it now enjoys a worthy epitaph.</p>",

Doubtless conceived as an orthodox rags-to-riches account of how Alan McGee's stewardship of the most celebrated independent record label in the world took him from a Glasgow housing scheme to 10 Downing Street, accruing vast wealth and narcotic-fuelled notoriety along the way, Cavanagh's project got overtaken by events. Most obvious of these was the souring of Creation's always problematic relationship with its prized asset Oasis, but the book's gestation also coincided with the British music industry's slide into recession and McGee's disillusionment with what his company - and by definition he himself - had become. Moreover, in the course of three years of research, the author glimpsed a bigger picture: that Creation's rise and fall was a metaphor, not just for the unfeasibility of true independence in a corporate era, but for social and cultural changes in Britain over the last 25 years, in which the adversarial post-war certainties of \"them and us\" were replaced by an uneasy new consensus based on unfettered materialism and the co-option of art by commerce. For all New Labour's self-serving attempts to claim him, Cavanagh suggests that the intuitively left-wing McGee is really a vindication of the Thatcherite era, and consequently riven with confused impulses. My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize transcends the parochial concerns of most rock biographies, although it comes steeped in them too. Indeed, the strength of this well-written book is in the details. The tale begins with a richly evocative depiction of mid-1970s Glasgow, a wasteland in many aspects but especially for disgruntled punk zealots like the young Alan McGee, who unsuccessfully auditioned for a formative version of Simple Minds before taking a mundane job as a British Rail stores clerk. Where less assiduous biographers might have jumped straight for the hedonistic jugular, Cavanagh dwells on these bleak times, following McGee down to London and charting his fervent efforts to stir life into the capital's moribund music scene. \"The key to understanding Alan McGee is not the years when he roared with vindication,\" he explains. \"It is the decades of disappointment and frustration that went before.\" Throughout, Cavanagh's wry, unsensational tone imposes much-needed perspective upon the mania that informed Creation's mission to wreak pop-art havoc upon the music establishment. Gorging on the book's anecdotal feast, one struggles to comprehend not only how Creation survived its hand-to-mouth existence long enough to become a potent force, but just how its cast of eccentrics, egotists and sociopaths eventually triumphed in such a brutal environment without one of them dying. Not that they didn't come close. The House of Love's swift disintegration from potential superstars into basket cases who spent \u00a310,000 in a year on taxi fares is played out with excruciating fastidiousness, while McGee's own drugged-up arrogance would be funny were it not for the dreadful personal price it eventually exacted. \"McGee took so much cocaine that his behaviour became Napoleonic,\" writes Cavanagh of a visit to New York in 1993. \"He threatened to beat up the concierge in his hotel when the plastic door-key to his room didn't work (until he realised he was on the wrong floor).\" Coupled with the phenomenal success of Oasis, McGee's 1994 nervous breakdown is presented as the catalyst for Creation adopting more conventional business practices, thereby losing the anarchic energy on which its aesthetic had thrived, and setting in motion a series of events that resulted in its eventual demise. Cavanagh reveals internal politicking worthy of Millbank, painting the sober McGee as gentler but no less paranoid, an increasingly distant figure, ill-at-ease with the market-led impulses of the new quasi-corporate company, although perfectly happy to accept the accompanying financial benefits. Ever prone to short-sighted outbursts of hubris, McGee has already denounced My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry for the Prize as \"the accountant's tale\", presumably because it represents him in an inconveniently candid light. And possibly also because Cavanagh has chosen to put Creation into its proper context, as merely the latest in a series of maverick attempts to take on the corporate music business, which happened to succeed (for a while) thanks to a combination of luck, Oasis and the sheer bloody-minded determination of its founder to persevere where others had given up. Creation was a definitive rock'n'roll fable, a story of high art and low cunning. Thanks to David Cavanagh, it now enjoys a worthy epitaph.",

      "body": "<p>If Gerald Corbett had boarded the 7.15am Taj Express to Agra yesterday, he might have been pleasantly surprised by the journey. The train was clean and left just three minutes late. Only a few people had to stand in the corridor.</p> <p>As the Indian countryside whizzed by, and the coffee wallah came round offering another cup of sweet Indian coffee for the paltry sum of five rupees, the former Railtrack chief executive might have usefully pondered what he did wrong.</p> <p>Unlike Britain's train system, India's still works. It was, of course, the British who built India's railways 150 years ago, in an epic feat of engineering which would connect the beaches of south India with the Khyber Pass. In total, the British laid 23,000 miles of track, in what turned out to be the biggest construction project ever carried out by a colonial power. But since then Britain seems to have lost the knack of managing railways. In India the trains continue to run with reasonable efficiency, despite the vast distances.</p> <p>Arriving at Nizamuddin station in New Delhi in the early morning gloom, I was reassured to see my name on a list of passengers with seats to travel. The platform was crowded. Some of the people on it were going on a journey; the rest live permanently in the station.</p> <p>There were plenty of diversions - tea stalls, phone booths, newspaper sellers, and a man frying pakoras in a giant pan of oil.</p> <p>The trick with Indian trains is to make a reservation first. With a population of 1bn, there is no point in turning up in the hope you will get a seat. With this in mind, I dropped into my local station two days beforehand. The queues are long, there is a tea break at 11.30am, but eventually you get there.</p> <p>My ticket to Agra from Delhi cost a mere 156 rupees (\u00a32.40), not bad for a round trip of about 300 miles. The train rolled in on time. I found my seat, S2 71. Amazingly, there was no one in it. Soon, though, a row erupted next to me. A young man was refusing to give up his seat to the old man who had actually reserved it. As the train clattered through Delhi's unlovely industrial southern suburbs, Vijay Menon, on his way to see his family in Agra, told of his brother, who was once stuck on a train to Bangalore for three days. \"He went to sleep and woke up to find he was still at the same station. There had been an oil spill.\"</p> <p>Most passengers with experience of British trains, however, agreed that the ones in India were more reliable.</p> <p>\"The Central Line is horrible. I do a lot of commuting by tube and they are always breaking down,\" said Veena Chauhan, a civil servant from Ealing, west London, visiting relatives in India. \"Indian railways are very good considering how vast the country is.\"</p> <p>Gradually, the suburbs gave way to countryside, a flat expanse of scrub, thatched farm buildings and cattle egrets.</p> <p>Inside the carriage a sock-wallah was trying to sell nylon socks at 10 rupees (13p) a pair. She was followed by the crisp-wallah, the newspaper-wallah, the ticket inspector, a blind singing beggar, and the peanut man. Finally the breakfast wallah came round. I bought two veg cutlets and a slice of bread for 15 rupees.</p> <p>Travelling by train in India is still a genuinely demotic experience. You might sit next to a cabinet minister or an illiterate cowherd.</p> <p>The Indian railway is also the world's largest employer, with 1.6m staff and 11m passengers a day. That the system works at all is miraculous. The fact that we arrived in Agra 15 minutes late was forgivable.</p> <p>\"In India we are not so worried about time. In the western world everyone is running around all the time. We just want to enjoy ourselves, go out for dinner, that kind of thing,\" said one of the passengers, Squadron Leader Ashok.</p> <p>Gerald Corbett, as he disappears from the fray into India for a month, might just agree.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Gerald Corbett had boarded the 7.15am Taj Express to Agra yesterday, he might have been pleasantly surprised by the journey. The train was clean and left just three minutes late. Only a few people had to stand in the corridor. As the Indian countryside whizzed by, and the coffee wallah came round offering another cup of sweet Indian coffee for the paltry sum of five rupees, the former Railtrack chief executive might have usefully pondered what he did wrong. Unlike Britain's train system, India's still works. It was, of course, the British who built India's railways 150 years ago, in an epic feat of engineering which would connect the beaches of south India with the Khyber Pass. In total, the British laid 23,000 miles of track, in what turned out to be the biggest construction project ever carried out by a colonial power. But since then Britain seems to have lost the knack of managing railways. In India the trains continue to run with reasonable efficiency, despite the vast distances. Arriving at Nizamuddin station in New Delhi in the early morning gloom, I was reassured to see my name on a list of passengers with seats to travel. The platform was crowded. Some of the people on it were going on a journey; the rest live permanently in the station. There were plenty of diversions - tea stalls, phone booths, newspaper sellers, and a man frying pakoras in a giant pan of oil. The trick with Indian trains is to make a reservation first. With a population of 1bn, there is no point in turning up in the hope you will get a seat. With this in mind, I dropped into my local station two days beforehand. The queues are long, there is a tea break at 11.30am, but eventually you get there. My ticket to Agra from Delhi cost a mere 156 rupees (\u00a32.40), not bad for a round trip of about 300 miles. The train rolled in on time. I found my seat, S2 71. Amazingly, there was no one in it. Soon, though, a row erupted next to me. A young man was refusing to give up his seat to the old man who had actually reserved it. As the train clattered through Delhi's unlovely industrial southern suburbs, Vijay Menon, on his way to see his family in Agra, told of his brother, who was once stuck on a train to Bangalore for three days. \"He went to sleep and woke up to find he was still at the same station. There had been an oil spill.\" Most passengers with experience of British trains, however, agreed that the ones in India were more reliable. \"The Central Line is horrible. I do a lot of commuting by tube and they are always breaking down,\" said Veena Chauhan, a civil servant from Ealing, west London, visiting relatives in India. \"Indian railways are very good considering how vast the country is.\" Gradually, the suburbs gave way to countryside, a flat expanse of scrub, thatched farm buildings and cattle egrets. Inside the carriage a sock-wallah was trying to sell nylon socks at 10 rupees (13p) a pair. She was followed by the crisp-wallah, the newspaper-wallah, the ticket inspector, a blind singing beggar, and the peanut man. Finally the breakfast wallah came round. I bought two veg cutlets and a slice of bread for 15 rupees. Travelling by train in India is still a genuinely demotic experience. You might sit next to a cabinet minister or an illiterate cowherd. The Indian railway is also the world's largest employer, with 1.6m staff and 11m passengers a day. That the system works at all is miraculous. The fact that we arrived in Agra 15 minutes late was forgivable. \"In India we are not so worried about time. In the western world everyone is running around all the time. We just want to enjoy ourselves, go out for dinner, that kind of thing,\" said one of the passengers, Squadron Leader Ashok. Gerald Corbett, as he disappears from the fray into India for a month, might just agree.",

      "body": "<p>A little way south of the centre of Bristol, there is a neat and peaceful patch of suburbia called Brislington. In among its redbrick rows of Victorian terraced homes, there is Churchill Road - an ordinary collection of two-storey houses with patches of grass out back and a couple of For Sale signs in the front. The door to number 49 is painted cream.</p> <p>In October 1997, a woman telephoned the police in Bristol to say that she was worried about her nephew, Ricky. He was 15, he had had some trouble in his family, and he kept going off for a day or two at a time. When he came back, he had new clothes or little gifts and he wouldn't say how he had got them. Was he stealing, was he mixed up in drugs? It worried her, and all she knew was that Ricky was going to a house at 49 Churchill Road.</p> <p>As a result of that call, the police opened the cream-coloured door and uncovered a rats' nest of child abuse - a full-blown paedophile ring. The house was a honey trap, fitted out with a gaming machine, a sauna, plenty of videos and drink and drugs and anything else that might persuade a wandering boy to come in off the streets. Inside the house, some of the boys had been slowly groomed for the sexual pleasure of men who lived there. Others had been simply raped. Some had been given heroin to keep them compliant. Several had been forced into prostitution. Some of the abusers had been busy for 20 years in one location or another.</p> <p>Three years on, the officers of Avon and Somerset's Child Protection Team have identified 89 boy victims, aged between six and 16. They have run four major trials at which victims have told stories of unmitigated pain and exploitation. Twelve men have been convicted of rape, forced buggery, indecent assault, supplying heroin and living off prostitution. Many of the men admitted their guilt and they have been jailed for a total of 66 years. The police found links between the house in Bristol and addresses in south Wales as well as Holland and France. All this conceals a deeper story.</p> <p>This other story begins four years before that phone call - with other phone calls, other alarm bells ringing. By October 1994, social services and police in Bristol had been warned repeatedly that vulnerable boys were being sexually abused at 49 Churchill Road.</p> <p>The loudest warning had come from a gay social worker, whose boyfriend was living in the house. Neither the social worker nor the boyfriend had any interest in child abuse. The social worker was worried about a 14-year-old boy who had run away from a children's home and returned in an agitated state.</p> <p>Through the boyfriend, he discovered that the runaway had been staying at 49 Churchill Road and that there were clear signs of paedophile activity there. The social worker went to the social services department. The police interviewed his boyfriend, who told them all he knew about the honey trap and the boys and the drugs and the sexual abuse. Other social workers had reported separately that a 13-year-old boy, who was on their register of children at risk, was believed to have become embroiled in Bristol's rent boy scene: he was disappearing for days at a time, he was believed to be using strong drugs and he was found to be carrying a piece of paper with a phone number - traced to 49 Churchill Road.</p> <p>Two other boys who had been living in a children's home had been reported to be visiting the house; one had been caught up in an earlier inquiry into child pornography. Worse still, a social worker who was based at the children's home was said to have introduced a vulnerable boy to the men in the house.</p> <p>On October 7, 1994, Avon's Child Protection Committee held a special meeting to discuss what they described as \"a potential paedophile ring\" at 49 Churchill Road. Three social workers and a police inspector reviewed all the clues and agreed to check all their records and to interview the children they believed to be involved; the social workers sent a minute of the meeting to their area manager; the police inspector said he would talk to his superintendent and to the Crown Prosecution Service ... and essentially nothing happened. Two years later, two more boys made allegations about the house. The rape and seduction and all the rest of it continued unabated.</p> <p>There is nothing unusual in that kind of failure to uncover and prosecute child abuse. Paedophilia is the least effectively policed crime in Britain. It is grossly under-reported by its victims: like the adult victims of sex abuse, they suffer from shame and the anticipation of disbelief in court; in addition, they are far more easily confused and intimidated by their abusers. Police generally make almost no attempt to go out and uncover unreported abuse: while every police force in the country pours resources into fighting drugs and robbery and burglary, only a handful of the 32 forces have proactive paedophile units.</p> <p>The operation which finally destroyed the Bristol ring broke through this wall of inaction, not because anyone in the Home Office or the Association of Chief Police Officers finally had the courage to address the scandal, but because of the chance involvement of several unusual individuals.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1996, a young detective sergeant named Rob Jones had moved to Avon and Somerset's Child Protection Team. The unit did not investigate cases at all. They just supplied back-up for social workers and advice for families and children who found themselves in police hands. It was no place for a real detective. But Rob Jones is one of nature's outsiders, a black belt in karate, a discipline which has given him unusual strength of will.</p> <p>He was joined by two experienced detective constables, Pete Mainstone and Phil Brown, and together they determined to go out and actively look for abused children. It was Pete Mainstone who took the call from Ricky's worried aunt in October 1997. And instead of merely processing it, he pushed to find out more. He arranged to meet Ricky with his aunt and he checked intelligence records and found that the house in Churchill Road was already suspect. Jones prepared for the possibility of a full-scale inquiry.</p> <p>Almost every step was a struggle against inertia. Ricky was reluctant to talk, but slowly he agreed to tell what he knew. He spoke of rent boys coming to the house; there was a suggestion that pornographic films were being made; he spoke of a stream of men who visited; he broke down and described eventually how he had been buggered relentlessly by two men; and he named them. One was Christopher Leek, now 44, a costume dresser who had worked on The Bill and who owned the house. He had been using it as a honey trap for years, but Avon and Somerset police had no intelligence on him. The other man, however, was notorious: Tony Stevens, now 45, had a long history of abusing boys. He had previously called himself Mark Underhill, but he was better known to under-aged rent boys in Bristol and south Wales as Fat Tony, and, although he had never been convicted in Britain, he had been arrested and jailed in Portugal in 1993 with two other British men after being caught paying local children to make pornographic videos.</p> <p>Rob Jones knew he was on to something important, but he and the two DCs could work on the case only part time, while they continued with conventional child protection work. They needed extra resources: surveillance officers to watch the house in Churchill Road; technical support so they could video those coming and going; more officers to follow up on the leads which Ricky had given them. Jones managed to borrow three officers from other units, but that was all.</p> <p>After months of part-time frustration, Jones decided to take a chance: he got a warrant to search the house and persuaded his bosses to give him proper back-up for just one night. He was taking a risk: Ricky had now disappeared without signing his statements, and if they found nothing in the house, the officers would have no evidence with which to charge the paedophiles and they would have squandered the tiny credibility they enjoyed with their bosses. On the night of February 3 1998, Avon and Somerset police finally opened the door at 49 Churchill Road.</p> <p>They found the whole place had been sanitised: no boys; no drugs; a computer hard disk that had been professionally wiped; photographic equipment stowed away. It turned out that during the months of delay, Ricky had told the men in the house that he had been talking to the police, and they had covered their tracks.</p> <p>There was no evidence there to justify a charge. But, by sheer persistence, the detectives had managed to track down Ricky only hours before the raid, and he had signed his statements. On that basis, they now arrested Christopher Leek and Fat Tony Stevens. As they searched the house, a boy named Andrew arrived. He started to talk, painting the same picture as Ricky, describing indecent assaults which he had suffered, and crucially he added the names of other boy victims and other men.</p> <p>Now, Rob Jones had a full-blooded investigation. But he was running it out of a shoebox. He needed more detectives to carry out interviews; he needed an incident room and he needed administrative officers to run it. But all he was given a single terminal and a part-time data inputter. At least one senior officer was actively arguing for the whole inquiry to be stopped immediately. And Jones had a more immediate worry: if Leek and Stevens got bail, he would have no chance of getting their victims to talk. Ricky had told them that the two men had taken him to a solicitor to file a complaint that the police were harrassing him.</p> <p>At this moment, another unusual individual joined the inquiry. Brendan Moorhouse is a barrister, working for the Crown Prosecution Service in their New Bridewell office in Bristol. He had grown up in apartheid South Africa with a real drive for justice and, when Rob Jones asked for his help, he made it his business not simply to act as a CPS case worker but to guide the police inquiry.</p> <p>From the first day, he organised a special strategy. They would build a big picture for the jury, aiming where possible to keep different offenders together in the same dock with a collection of their victims as witnesses. It would be much harder work than simply running a sequence of small trials, but it was their best chance of showing the jury the truth. And Moorhouse volunteered to turn up in court personally to take charge of every bail application. His first success was to keep Leek and Stevens behind bars while Jones' officers tracked down their victims.</p> <p><b> Strokes of luck</b><br></p> <p>For three months, with Moorhouse's guidance, detectives gathered more evidence. By June, they had 15 victims and a queue of men waiting to be arrested - and no extra resources. And senior officers had made up their minds to pull the plug. They had appointed a new chief inspector to run the Child Protection Team and briefed him to stop the job before it got any bigger.</p> <p>At this point, Jones' team had two strokes of luck. First, the new chief inspector, Ian Appleton, turned out to be a man who understood what they were doing, and he got them their own incident room and even some cars. Rob Jones assembled a \"dirty dozen\" officers, begged and borrowed from uniformed work or CID teams. Operation Panorama was born. The second stroke of luck was the arrival of a new chief constable, Steve Pilkington, who agreed to support the inquiry in a way that some of his predecessors and many of his contemporaries would not. On July 7, 1998, Jones' team co-ordinated a series of dawn arrests. Now, they had a total of 10 men in custody.</p> <p>Following the grapevine of victims, they traced a 26-year-old Welshman named Wayne, who had first become a victim of Fat Tony Stevens 14 years earlier, when he was only 12. Wayne told them how he had grown up in south Wales and how, when he was six or seven, he had joined a stamp club run by an adolescent boy called Alan Williams. Wayne was not to know that Williams was to grow up to become one of the most ruthless abusers in Britain, a rapist and child pornographer known in the paedophile world as the Welsh Witch.</p> <p>Wayne described how Williams asked him to stay behind after stamp club and introduced him to an old man, who smelled bad. They took it in turns to bugger him. Then they threw him out, and Wayne recalled how he wandered off in panic. Wayne never even tried to tell what had happened. He knew no one would believe him if he did.</p> <p>From that day, Wayne became a plaything for Alan Williams and his adult friends. They told him, if he ever betrayed them, they would kill his dog and hurt his sister and tell his family he was queer. Sometimes, they gave him cannabis and LSD. If they wanted him during the day, they would send the school forged letters from his parents to justify his absence. This had been going on intermittently for four or five years, when Alan Williams first introduced him to Fat Tony. Wayne said he was coming out of school when Williams came up beside him in a car with a man. They gave him some dope to smoke and some Pernod and drove him to a house in Roath on the edge of Cardiff. Fat Tony was waiting there, and all three of them now went for him at once. When he eventually got home, his father beat him for being so late back from school. Wayne took to sniffing glue; the more delinquent he became, the more vulnerable he was. Fat Tony and the others abused him in chalets and caravan parks, and in each other's houses. They took him to other paedophiles and swapped him for their boys for the night.</p> <p>It was clear that not all the men who lived at 49 Churchill Road were involved or even aware of the child abuse there. The house became a magnet for Fat Tony and his friends - Army John, Rob the Van Man, Kevin the Gerbil, Gerry the Dog, Peter the ice-cream man, who was too obese to act out most of his fantasies, a 61-year-old dope dealer called Alan Tanner, and Alan Williams.</p> <p>Chris Leek, who owned it, rented out rooms, many of them to men looking for young boys. Fat Tony himself eventually took one of them. Leek spent hours down on Anchor Road in the middle of Bristol, where the old public toilets were the main market place for the city's rent boys.</p> <p>Sometimes the rent boys sold themselves willingly. Other times, they were raped. The men also targeted boys from two local schools and picked up runaways from children's homes, offering them the safety of a bed in Churchill Road. One was picked up hitchhiking and raped at knifepoint.</p> <p>Older boys were just as vulnerable. One boy described how, as a 17-year-old, he had fled from his family home, where his father had been using him for sex. He stayed with a friend, had a row about the rent and found himself homeless. One of the men from Churchill Road found him and offered him safe haven.</p> <p>The police found that Leek had been reaping a financial and sexual bonus by forcing some of the boys to sell them selves. One 13-year-old made the mistake of asking him for cannabis: Leek gave him heroin to smoke, got him addicted, forcibly buggered him and then later put him to work in the toilets in Anchor Road under threat of cutting off his supply.</p> <p>The boy who had run away from his father's abuse was eventually paid \u00a314,000 compensation. Chris Leek persuaded him to invest it in a building society in their joint names and then spent almost all of the money himself.</p> <p><b> Spreading web</b><br></p> <p>The Operation Panorma team soon found themselves in an ever-increasing web of alleged offences. By the beginning of 1999, they had some 80 possible victims and more than 60 suspected abusers - and only 10 of them had been arrested. Some of those who were still at large were prolific paedophiles. The man who was known at Churchill Road as Army John turned out to be John Gay, now 49, whose history of abuse went back even further than Fat Tony Stevens'. Police discovered that he was a close friend of Alan Williams, and that he had been abusing Wayne when he was only six or seven.</p> <p>With 10 men in custody awaiting trial and 60 more waiting to be investigated, this had become a big job. A perpetrator claimed to have been raped by one of the men in custody when he was only 13 and agreed to press charges. At the CPS, Brendan Moorhouse was working in an office which had lost more than a quarter of its lawyers through funding cuts. It was a full time job simply dealing with the 10 men who had been arrested. And he was juggling this with some 250 other cases.

      "bodyText": "A little way south of the centre of Bristol, there is a neat and peaceful patch of suburbia called Brislington. In among its redbrick rows of Victorian terraced homes, there is Churchill Road - an ordinary collection of two-storey houses with patches of grass out back and a couple of For Sale signs in the front. The door to number 49 is painted cream. In October 1997, a woman telephoned the police in Bristol to say that she was worried about her nephew, Ricky. He was 15, he had had some trouble in his family, and he kept going off for a day or two at a time. When he came back, he had new clothes or little gifts and he wouldn't say how he had got them. Was he stealing, was he mixed up in drugs? It worried her, and all she knew was that Ricky was going to a house at 49 Churchill Road. As a result of that call, the police opened the cream-coloured door and uncovered a rats' nest of child abuse - a full-blown paedophile ring. The house was a honey trap, fitted out with a gaming machine, a sauna, plenty of videos and drink and drugs and anything else that might persuade a wandering boy to come in off the streets. Inside the house, some of the boys had been slowly groomed for the sexual pleasure of men who lived there. Others had been simply raped. Some had been given heroin to keep them compliant. Several had been forced into prostitution. Some of the abusers had been busy for 20 years in one location or another. Three years on, the officers of Avon and Somerset's Child Protection Team have identified 89 boy victims, aged between six and 16. They have run four major trials at which victims have told stories of unmitigated pain and exploitation. Twelve men have been convicted of rape, forced buggery, indecent assault, supplying heroin and living off prostitution. Many of the men admitted their guilt and they have been jailed for a total of 66 years. The police found links between the house in Bristol and addresses in south Wales as well as Holland and France. All this conceals a deeper story. This other story begins four years before that phone call - with other phone calls, other alarm bells ringing. By October 1994, social services and police in Bristol had been warned repeatedly that vulnerable boys were being sexually abused at 49 Churchill Road. The loudest warning had come from a gay social worker, whose boyfriend was living in the house. Neither the social worker nor the boyfriend had any interest in child abuse. The social worker was worried about a 14-year-old boy who had run away from a children's home and returned in an agitated state. Through the boyfriend, he discovered that the runaway had been staying at 49 Churchill Road and that there were clear signs of paedophile activity there. The social worker went to the social services department. The police interviewed his boyfriend, who told them all he knew about the honey trap and the boys and the drugs and the sexual abuse. Other social workers had reported separately that a 13-year-old boy, who was on their register of children at risk, was believed to have become embroiled in Bristol's rent boy scene: he was disappearing for days at a time, he was believed to be using strong drugs and he was found to be carrying a piece of paper with a phone number - traced to 49 Churchill Road. Two other boys who had been living in a children's home had been reported to be visiting the house; one had been caught up in an earlier inquiry into child pornography. Worse still, a social worker who was based at the children's home was said to have introduced a vulnerable boy to the men in the house. On October 7, 1994, Avon's Child Protection Committee held a special meeting to discuss what they described as \"a potential paedophile ring\" at 49 Churchill Road. Three social workers and a police inspector reviewed all the clues and agreed to check all their records and to interview the children they believed to be involved; the social workers sent a minute of the meeting to their area manager; the police inspector said he would talk to his superintendent and to the Crown Prosecution Service ... and essentially nothing happened. Two years later, two more boys made allegations about the house. The rape and seduction and all the rest of it continued unabated. There is nothing unusual in that kind of failure to uncover and prosecute child abuse. Paedophilia is the least effectively policed crime in Britain. It is grossly under-reported by its victims: like the adult victims of sex abuse, they suffer from shame and the anticipation of disbelief in court; in addition, they are far more easily confused and intimidated by their abusers. Police generally make almost no attempt to go out and uncover unreported abuse: while every police force in the country pours resources into fighting drugs and robbery and burglary, only a handful of the 32 forces have proactive paedophile units. The operation which finally destroyed the Bristol ring broke through this wall of inaction, not because anyone in the Home Office or the Association of Chief Police Officers finally had the courage to address the scandal, but because of the chance involvement of several unusual individuals. In the autumn of 1996, a young detective sergeant named Rob Jones had moved to Avon and Somerset's Child Protection Team. The unit did not investigate cases at all. They just supplied back-up for social workers and advice for families and children who found themselves in police hands. It was no place for a real detective. But Rob Jones is one of nature's outsiders, a black belt in karate, a discipline which has given him unusual strength of will. He was joined by two experienced detective constables, Pete Mainstone and Phil Brown, and together they determined to go out and actively look for abused children. It was Pete Mainstone who took the call from Ricky's worried aunt in October 1997. And instead of merely processing it, he pushed to find out more. He arranged to meet Ricky with his aunt and he checked intelligence records and found that the house in Churchill Road was already suspect. Jones prepared for the possibility of a full-scale inquiry. Almost every step was a struggle against inertia. Ricky was reluctant to talk, but slowly he agreed to tell what he knew. He spoke of rent boys coming to the house; there was a suggestion that pornographic films were being made; he spoke of a stream of men who visited; he broke down and described eventually how he had been buggered relentlessly by two men; and he named them. One was Christopher Leek, now 44, a costume dresser who had worked on The Bill and who owned the house. He had been using it as a honey trap for years, but Avon and Somerset police had no intelligence on him. The other man, however, was notorious: Tony Stevens, now 45, had a long history of abusing boys. He had previously called himself Mark Underhill, but he was better known to under-aged rent boys in Bristol and south Wales as Fat Tony, and, although he had never been convicted in Britain, he had been arrested and jailed in Portugal in 1993 with two other British men after being caught paying local children to make pornographic videos. Rob Jones knew he was on to something important, but he and the two DCs could work on the case only part time, while they continued with conventional child protection work. They needed extra resources: surveillance officers to watch the house in Churchill Road; technical support so they could video those coming and going; more officers to follow up on the leads which Ricky had given them. Jones managed to borrow three officers from other units, but that was all. After months of part-time frustration, Jones decided to take a chance: he got a warrant to search the house and persuaded his bosses to give him proper back-up for just one night. He was taking a risk: Ricky had now disappeared without signing his statements, and if they found nothing in the house, the officers would have no evidence with which to charge the paedophiles and they would have squandered the tiny credibility they enjoyed with their bosses. On the night of February 3 1998, Avon and Somerset police finally opened the door at 49 Churchill Road. They found the whole place had been sanitised: no boys; no drugs; a computer hard disk that had been professionally wiped; photographic equipment stowed away. It turned out that during the months of delay, Ricky had told the men in the house that he had been talking to the police, and they had covered their tracks. There was no evidence there to justify a charge. But, by sheer persistence, the detectives had managed to track down Ricky only hours before the raid, and he had signed his statements. On that basis, they now arrested Christopher Leek and Fat Tony Stevens. As they searched the house, a boy named Andrew arrived. He started to talk, painting the same picture as Ricky, describing indecent assaults which he had suffered, and crucially he added the names of other boy victims and other men. Now, Rob Jones had a full-blooded investigation. But he was running it out of a shoebox. He needed more detectives to carry out interviews; he needed an incident room and he needed administrative officers to run it. But all he was given a single terminal and a part-time data inputter. At least one senior officer was actively arguing for the whole inquiry to be stopped immediately. And Jones had a more immediate worry: if Leek and Stevens got bail, he would have no chance of getting their victims to talk. Ricky had told them that the two men had taken him to a solicitor to file a complaint that the police were harrassing him. At this moment, another unusual individual joined the inquiry. Brendan Moorhouse is a barrister, working for the Crown Prosecution Service in their New Bridewell office in Bristol. He had grown up in apartheid South Africa with a real drive for justice and, when Rob Jones asked for his help, he made it his business not simply to act as a CPS case worker but to guide the police inquiry. From the first day, he organised a special strategy. They would build a big picture for the jury, aiming where possible to keep different offenders together in the same dock with a collection of their victims as witnesses. It would be much harder work than simply running a sequence of small trials, but it was their best chance of showing the jury the truth. And Moorhouse volunteered to turn up in court personally to take charge of every bail application. His first success was to keep Leek and Stevens behind bars while Jones' officers tracked down their victims. Strokes of luck For three months, with Moorhouse's guidance, detectives gathered more evidence. By June, they had 15 victims and a queue of men waiting to be arrested - and no extra resources. And senior officers had made up their minds to pull the plug. They had appointed a new chief inspector to run the Child Protection Team and briefed him to stop the job before it got any bigger. At this point, Jones' team had two strokes of luck. First, the new chief inspector, Ian Appleton, turned out to be a man who understood what they were doing, and he got them their own incident room and even some cars. Rob Jones assembled a \"dirty dozen\" officers, begged and borrowed from uniformed work or CID teams. Operation Panorama was born. The second stroke of luck was the arrival of a new chief constable, Steve Pilkington, who agreed to support the inquiry in a way that some of his predecessors and many of his contemporaries would not. On July 7, 1998, Jones' team co-ordinated a series of dawn arrests. Now, they had a total of 10 men in custody. Following the grapevine of victims, they traced a 26-year-old Welshman named Wayne, who had first become a victim of Fat Tony Stevens 14 years earlier, when he was only 12. Wayne told them how he had grown up in south Wales and how, when he was six or seven, he had joined a stamp club run by an adolescent boy called Alan Williams. Wayne was not to know that Williams was to grow up to become one of the most ruthless abusers in Britain, a rapist and child pornographer known in the paedophile world as the Welsh Witch. Wayne described how Williams asked him to stay behind after stamp club and introduced him to an old man, who smelled bad. They took it in turns to bugger him. Then they threw him out, and Wayne recalled how he wandered off in panic. Wayne never even tried to tell what had happened. He knew no one would believe him if he did. From that day, Wayne became a plaything for Alan Williams and his adult friends. They told him, if he ever betrayed them, they would kill his dog and hurt his sister and tell his family he was queer. Sometimes, they gave him cannabis and LSD. If they wanted him during the day, they would send the school forged letters from his parents to justify his absence. This had been going on intermittently for four or five years, when Alan Williams first introduced him to Fat Tony. Wayne said he was coming out of school when Williams came up beside him in a car with a man. They gave him some dope to smoke and some Pernod and drove him to a house in Roath on the edge of Cardiff. Fat Tony was waiting there, and all three of them now went for him at once. When he eventually got home, his father beat him for being so late back from school. Wayne took to sniffing glue; the more delinquent he became, the more vulnerable he was. Fat Tony and the others abused him in chalets and caravan parks, and in each other's houses. They took him to other paedophiles and swapped him for their boys for the night. It was clear that not all the men who lived at 49 Churchill Road were involved or even aware of the child abuse there. The house became a magnet for Fat Tony and his friends - Army John, Rob the Van Man, Kevin the Gerbil, Gerry the Dog, Peter the ice-cream man, who was too obese to act out most of his fantasies, a 61-year-old dope dealer called Alan Tanner, and Alan Williams. Chris Leek, who owned it, rented out rooms, many of them to men looking for young boys. Fat Tony himself eventually took one of them. Leek spent hours down on Anchor Road in the middle of Bristol, where the old public toilets were the main market place for the city's rent boys. Sometimes the rent boys sold themselves willingly. Other times, they were raped. The men also targeted boys from two local schools and picked up runaways from children's homes, offering them the safety of a bed in Churchill Road. One was picked up hitchhiking and raped at knifepoint. Older boys were just as vulnerable. One boy described how, as a 17-year-old, he had fled from his family home, where his father had been using him for sex. He stayed with a friend, had a row about the rent and found himself homeless. One of the men from Churchill Road found him and offered him safe haven. The police found that Leek had been reaping a financial and sexual bonus by forcing some of the boys to sell them selves. One 13-year-old made the mistake of asking him for cannabis: Leek gave him heroin to smoke, got him addicted, forcibly buggered him and then later put him to work in the toilets in Anchor Road under threat of cutting off his supply. The boy who had run away from his father's abuse was eventually paid \u00a314,000 compensation. Chris Leek persuaded him to invest it in a building society in their joint names and then spent almost all of the money himself. Spreading web The Operation Panorma team soon found themselves in an ever-increasing web of alleged offences. By the beginning of 1999, they had some 80 possible victims and more than 60 suspected abusers - and only 10 of them had been arrested. Some of those who were still at large were prolific paedophiles. The man who was known at Churchill Road as Army John turned out to be John Gay, now 49, whose history of abuse went back even further than Fat Tony Stevens'. Police discovered that he was a close friend of Alan Williams, and that he had been abusing Wayne when he was only six or seven. With 10 men in custody awaiting trial and 60 more waiting to be investigated, this had become a big job. A perpetrator claimed to have been raped by one of the men in custody when he was only 13 and agreed to press charges. At the CPS, Brendan Moorhouse was working in an office which had lost more than a quarter of its lawyers through funding cuts. It was a full time job simply dealing with the 10 men who had been arrested. And he was juggling this with some 250 other cases. His determination to hold all the defendants together to make a big picture for the jury made the job even more complex. For senior officers at Avon and Somerset police, the big problem was the Home Office, which now steers police activity with a list of \"best value performance indicators\", on which each force is judged. There are 37 of them. But there is nothing anywhere in any of them about child abuse. By diverting resources into Operation Panorama, Avon and Somerset was risking its corporate neck. At current strength, Operation Panorama could just about cope with prosecuting the 10 men. At one point, they lost their incident room, when a murder squad pushed them out. Under this pressure, there was no chance of Panorama being given extra resources to deal with the 60 new suspects, all of whom remained at liberty more than a year after the last wave of arrests. Instead, the Panorama officers ran a risk assessment on them, singled out Gay and Tucker as the two most dangerous, and looked forward to the moment they could spare officers to start investigating them. Alan Williams had escaped justice by dying in a mess of heroin and Aids during the delay. Dozens of other suspects were put on the back burner. In September 1999, the Panorama detectives began three linked trials at Bristol crown court. By December, without a single word of national publicity, all 10 defendants had pleaded guilty or had been convicted by a jury. Most of them were jailed - Christopher Leek for 12 years, Tony Stevens for eight. The judge commended Jones and his team. By the time the trials were over, John Gay and Lee Tucker had been arrested, and the Panorama team were ready to gather more evidence on them and to get to grips with the long queue of up to 60 other suspects. But their time was running out. Avon and Somerset police had by now ploughed huge resources into the inquiry, on a scale unsupported by the Home Office. The Bristol detectives could pursue all the loose ends effectively only by setting up a full-time paedophilia unit.

John Gay and Lee Tucker were convicted last month at Swindon crown court. After 20 years of unremitting abuse, Gay was finally sent to prison for 12 years for two counts of buggering Wayne when he was under 16, seven counts of indecently assaulting Wayne and two other under-aged boys, four counts of supplying drugs, and one count of forced buggery on the boy who had been addicted to heroin by Christopher Leek. Jumped bail Lee Tucker was jailed for eight years on nine counts of buggering and indecently assaulting under-aged boys as well as administering them stupefying drugs. Tucker, however, had been given bail so he could be treated for the HIV virus, and three days before the verdict, he vanished.

Two years later, General Franco pulled out, the king got his chance, and instead of independence, the Sahrawis got Moroccan occupation.</p> <p>He has been president of the notional Saharan republic since 1982, but still has to live in exile in neighbouring Algeria, long at odds with Morocco and thus Mr Abdel-Aziz's staunchest backer.</p> <p>Now seeking to regain lost ground after what really does seem to be the final collapse of a UN plan for a referendum on the future status of the disputed Saharan region, Mr Abdel-Aziz blames Morocco for the impasse. He argues that the late King Hassan's successor, King Mohammed, though a liberaliser in some ways, is his father's son on the Sahara.</p> <p>\"We had hopes of cooperation with the new king, but he is not dealing with the issues in a new way,\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Abdel-Aziz, a powerfully built man, speaks passionately - in careful classical Arabic with a distinctive Sahrawi Hassaniya accent - of the right to self-determination of a small people it sometimes seems has been simply forgotten by history.</p> <p>\"No, nothing has changed,\" he says defiantly. \"Twenty-five years of sacrifices and hardship have made us more determined than ever to win our legitimate rights.\" But much has changed. Back in the mid-70s and early 80s, Polisario fighters made the Moroccans pay a heavy price for taking over the phosphate-rich territory along the Atlantic seaboard.</p> <p>Using language inspired by the Palestinians, the Sahrawis attracted wide support as a Third World liberation movement betrayed by a world that preferred to look the other way.</p> <p>Morocco, like Indonesia, mattered more to the US and its allies than the fate of a few hundred thousand nomads who happened to believe they were a distinct people with their own identity.</p> <p>In their refugee camps in Tindouf in remote south-western Algeria, the Polisario fighters impressed visitors with their high morale and motivation as guerrillas in all-terrain vehicles scoured the gravel plains to mount hit-and-run raids on Moroccan forces.</p> <p>Yet fighting stopped under a ceasefire nine years ago, and last month the UN as much as admitted that referendum plans were stalled after years of Morrocan procrastination over how to register voters.</p> <p><b> Support dwindles</b><br></p> <p>Diplomatic recognition of the would-be republic has dwindled, too, though its leader said that India, a big player in the non-aligned world, had only \"frozen\" links. And Nigeria remained loyal.</p> <p>The phantom state is still a member of the Organisation of African Unity. But Algeria - anxious to mend its fences with Morocco - leaned heavily on its leaders not to insist on attending the EU-Africa summit in Cairo earlier this year. They stayed away.</p> <p>Mr Abdel-Aziz insists he will not accept autonomy under Moroccan rule - an idea quietly encouraged by the US and France. He has urged the EU to make its relations with Morocco - the largest single recipient of aid from the union - conditional on movement on a referendum. But the fact is that none of the 15 want to upset the new king, praised for reforms since assuming power last summer.</p> <p>\"European countries decided from the start not to use their influence to bring about a settlement and instead they are bolstering a colonial enterprise,\" said Mr Abdel-Aziz. \"But they should convince the Moroccans to support the referendum.\"</p>",

Now seeking to regain lost ground after what really does seem to be the final collapse of a UN plan for a referendum on the future status of the disputed Saharan region, Mr Abdel-Aziz blames Morocco for the impasse. He argues that the late King Hassan's successor, King Mohammed, though a liberaliser in some ways, is his father's son on the Sahara. \"We had hopes of cooperation with the new king, but he is not dealing with the issues in a new way,\" he said yesterday. Mr Abdel-Aziz, a powerfully built man, speaks passionately - in careful classical Arabic with a distinctive Sahrawi Hassaniya accent - of the right to self-determination of a small people it sometimes seems has been simply forgotten by history. \"No, nothing has changed,\" he says defiantly. \"Twenty-five years of sacrifices and hardship have made us more determined than ever to win our legitimate rights.\" But much has changed. Back in the mid-70s and early 80s, Polisario fighters made the Moroccans pay a heavy price for taking over the phosphate-rich territory along the Atlantic seaboard. Using language inspired by the Palestinians, the Sahrawis attracted wide support as a Third World liberation movement betrayed by a world that preferred to look the other way. Morocco, like Indonesia, mattered more to the US and its allies than the fate of a few hundred thousand nomads who happened to believe they were a distinct people with their own identity. In their refugee camps in Tindouf in remote south-western Algeria, the Polisario fighters impressed visitors with their high morale and motivation as guerrillas in all-terrain vehicles scoured the gravel plains to mount hit-and-run raids on Moroccan forces. Yet fighting stopped under a ceasefire nine years ago, and last month the UN as much as admitted that referendum plans were stalled after years of Morrocan procrastination over how to register voters. Support dwindles Diplomatic recognition of the would-be republic has dwindled, too, though its leader said that India, a big player in the non-aligned world, had only \"frozen\" links. And Nigeria remained loyal. The phantom state is still a member of the Organisation of African Unity. But Algeria - anxious to mend its fences with Morocco - leaned heavily on its leaders not to insist on attending the EU-Africa summit in Cairo earlier this year. They stayed away. Mr Abdel-Aziz insists he will not accept autonomy under Moroccan rule - an idea quietly encouraged by the US and France. He has urged the EU to make its relations with Morocco - the largest single recipient of aid from the union - conditional on movement on a referendum. But the fact is that none of the 15 want to upset the new king, praised for reforms since assuming power last summer. \"European countries decided from the start not to use their influence to bring about a settlement and instead they are bolstering a colonial enterprise,\" said Mr Abdel-Aziz. \"But they should convince the Moroccans to support the referendum.\"",

Her reputation is formidable: from lawyer to George Walker, the boxer turned leisure tycoon, to more recently the \"motorist's champion\" during the competition commission's controversial investigation into overpriced cars. </p> <p>She relished her title as the most feared woman in Britain. \"You don't want a wimp, you want a tough lawyer,\" she says. Many legal battles are actually settled in corridors rather than courts; this is when height counted most. \"It's the gladiatorial battle of the courts, that's when you need height.\" </p> <p>Slim, blond and elegant, she admits to having used her striking appearance to her advantage. </p> <p>That is now all behind her. In Ms Kingsmill's role as deputy chairman of the competition commission, where she has tackled issues as diverse as the price of raw milk and the intricacies of how City financiers set their charges for underwriting debt issues for companies, such adversarial tendencies are less important. </p> <p>\"We are interlocutive rather than adversarial,\" she says. Giving companies a fair hearing and making the laborious process more accessible to the public is now her main goal. Her public hearing into car prices was boycotted by the manufacturers but she still concluded that the way they sell cars - the block exemption - is leading to higher prices, which she hopes will start to fall dramatically in 2002 if the EU's competition watchdog takes action to break the mould. </p> <p>In the coming weeks, the resulkts of her latest investigation, into the electricity industry, are likely to be made public by Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary. She says with a laughthat the most she knew about electricity before starting the inquiry was turning on a light. </p> <p>Now she knows much more. \"I've seen these huge turbine halls, this sense of industrial power. It's fantastic, it's romantic.\" Striking a balance between competition in former state-owned monopolies and regulation is her task. \"Fair and rigorous competition is the cornerstone of economic growth. It is through this strong economic growth we can afford the social justice we should aspire to.\" </p> <p><strong> Breaking the mould</strong><br> </p> <p> She is fiercely aware of being a woman in a what still is a man's world. She is passionate about breaking the mould in Britain's boardrooms. She attended the release of a survey this month that showed of all 1,247 non-executive directorships in the 108 biggest companies just 65 are held by women. </p> <p>It is not that she wants to catapult women into the boardroom for the sake of it but she would like to see an end to the uniformity of the boardroom - of public school-educated men of a certain age who have worked their way up through the ranks. \"There are too many non-executive clones.\" </p> <p>She speaks from experience. After years advising companies and sacked executives about how to get a good deal, Ms Kingsmill waded in to her first non-executive position with gusto. After what she recalls as a \"seriously bloody\" boardroom battle, she became deputy chairman of MFI. Her fashion sense is behind the invigorated image of MFI on the high street. She set up a \"design leadership group\" to put the glamour back into frumpy kitchens and insists her home in Holland Park has an MFI kitchen. </p> <p>\"[MFI] put in the reach of ordinary people glamorously glossy kitchens which at the time it was set up were out of the reach of ordinary people.\" </p> <p>Born in New Zealand, she moved to her mother's native south Wales at the age of eight. It was a shock. She was tall, lanky and spoke oddly. \"It has made all subsequent changes in my life a doddle,\" she says. Her accent now dulled, she admits she was glad to get out of Wales. But she left her mark in the small town of Croesyceiliog where her name is on the wall of the grammar school as the first pupil of either sex to go to Oxbridge. </p> <p>Girton, Cambridge, was the setting in what she describes as the vintage years of 1965-68. Again gender was an issue. Ms Kingsmill remembers being one of six woman in a class of 300 men, studying economics and anthropology. </p> <p>With hindsight she has concluded it was not really her world. It gave her a taste for tackling prejudice. A life-long member of the Labour party, she is at pains to point out her appointment to the competition commission was made by the previous government. Her Blairite credentials and perceived ambition also led to speculation that she would be next head of the office of fair trading, a job she did not get and says now she never wanted. \"I was very flattered to have been considered to be a candidate and mightily relieved I didn't get the job.\" </p> <p>She wants to be able to keep her foot in the commercial world, holding on to her non-executive positions. Since joining the competition commission she has turned down new non-executive positions but lends her support an initiative to highlight the absence of woman from boardrooms. </p> <p>\"One wants more diversity, we need a different kind of man as well.

Although the hiatus in activity is a consequence of \"one-off\" factors, it could easily shake confidence within the economy and trigger a slowdown. In America the presidential impasse must have had a similar effect on economic activity. A nation staring at itself through its TV screens is one unable to focus on its work. A growth hiccup is possible, adding to pressure on share prices. Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities",

      "body": "<p>A general election on May 3, preceded by a lengthy campaign including high profile TV debates, appeared to be on the cards yesterday as Labour examined the implications of its three byelection victories on Thursday night.</p> <p>Millbank officials said there would have to be very good reasons now for the prime minister to be knocked off course and delay beyond May 3. \"The Tories are desperate for delay, but it seems less and less necessary,\" one official said.</p> <p>Although all three seats could be regarded as safe Labour territory, ministers had said they expected difficulty holding them, especially West Bromwich West, the seat previously held by the former speaker, Betty Boothroyd.</p> <p>The result has generated optimism within government and prompted Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman, to indicate the viability of TV debates in order to generate voter enthusiasm; all three byelections were marked by low turnouts. The TV companies have put forward a joint proposal to secure the agreement of the political parties, but there are already difficulties over the treatment of the Liberal Democrats</p> <p>The Conservatives have yet to gain a seat in the 16 byelections held during this parliament, a rare failure for an opposition party. Although the Conservatives enjoyed swings of more than 10 % on Thursday, they were tiny in comparison with the byelection swings away from the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major years. In 1996 Labour enjoyed a swing of 22% on a 60% turnout in South East Staffordshire, while in February 1997 it won Wirral South on a turnout of 73%.</p> <p>The Conservative chairman, Michael Ancram, claimed the Tory share of the vote had gone back up to the levels of the 1992 general election. He claimed the Tories had not gained byelections in this parliament because none had been held in any winnable territory. William Hague described the results as \"steady progress on what we have achieved in elections earlier this year\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said the results showed \"no enthusiasm for Labour and no hope for the Conservatives\".</p> <p>Millbank officials admitted the turnout on Thursday night was again worryingly low: 27.6% in West Bromwich, 29.39% in Preston and 38.42% in Glasgow Anniesland. But they said the figures, which beat the desultory 19.6% turnout in Leeds Central byelection in June 1999, were about 5% higher than their canvass returns had been suggesting. Officials said voters had no reason to turn out in such safe seats and that canvass records tend to be better in swing seats, making it easier to get the core vote out.</p> <p>Mr Campbell claimed Mr Hague was running a backdoor strategy to win Downing Street, trying to stir up apathy, depressing turnout and then winning off the back of his core vote.</p> <p>He said the Tories were trying to create the impression that voting does not bring about reform. The Tories had nothing to offer voters apart from \"bandwagons and Europhobia\", he said.</p> <p>Labour officials have already launched Operation Turnout in an effort to galvanise the core vote in the coming election. The strategy is based on retaining regular contact with voters by local parties before the election. The recent thank you poster campaign is also designed to push home the message that voting does make a difference.</p> <p>Labour officials were also taking heart from the turnout among older voters. They claimed their canvass returns showed the pensions issue was no longer a negative for the government after the big rises in the basic pension in the pre-Budget report three weeks ago.</p> <p>Millbank claims the Conservatives are now in difficulty over their own pension policy, which includes a commitment to remove the \u00a3200 winter fuel allowance and roll it into the basic pension. Labour ran strong messages claiming the Conservatives would have taken the \u00a3200 away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A general election on May 3, preceded by a lengthy campaign including high profile TV debates, appeared to be on the cards yesterday as Labour examined the implications of its three byelection victories on Thursday night. Millbank officials said there would have to be very good reasons now for the prime minister to be knocked off course and delay beyond May 3. \"The Tories are desperate for delay, but it seems less and less necessary,\" one official said. Although all three seats could be regarded as safe Labour territory, ministers had said they expected difficulty holding them, especially West Bromwich West, the seat previously held by the former speaker, Betty Boothroyd. The result has generated optimism within government and prompted Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman, to indicate the viability of TV debates in order to generate voter enthusiasm; all three byelections were marked by low turnouts. The TV companies have put forward a joint proposal to secure the agreement of the political parties, but there are already difficulties over the treatment of the Liberal Democrats The Conservatives have yet to gain a seat in the 16 byelections held during this parliament, a rare failure for an opposition party. Although the Conservatives enjoyed swings of more than 10 % on Thursday, they were tiny in comparison with the byelection swings away from the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major years. In 1996 Labour enjoyed a swing of 22% on a 60% turnout in South East Staffordshire, while in February 1997 it won Wirral South on a turnout of 73%. The Conservative chairman, Michael Ancram, claimed the Tory share of the vote had gone back up to the levels of the 1992 general election. He claimed the Tories had not gained byelections in this parliament because none had been held in any winnable territory. William Hague described the results as \"steady progress on what we have achieved in elections earlier this year\". The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said the results showed \"no enthusiasm for Labour and no hope for the Conservatives\". Millbank officials admitted the turnout on Thursday night was again worryingly low: 27.6% in West Bromwich, 29.39% in Preston and 38.42% in Glasgow Anniesland. But they said the figures, which beat the desultory 19.6% turnout in Leeds Central byelection in June 1999, were about 5% higher than their canvass returns had been suggesting. Officials said voters had no reason to turn out in such safe seats and that canvass records tend to be better in swing seats, making it easier to get the core vote out. Mr Campbell claimed Mr Hague was running a backdoor strategy to win Downing Street, trying to stir up apathy, depressing turnout and then winning off the back of his core vote. He said the Tories were trying to create the impression that voting does not bring about reform. The Tories had nothing to offer voters apart from \"bandwagons and Europhobia\", he said. Labour officials have already launched Operation Turnout in an effort to galvanise the core vote in the coming election. The strategy is based on retaining regular contact with voters by local parties before the election. The recent thank you poster campaign is also designed to push home the message that voting does make a difference. Labour officials were also taking heart from the turnout among older voters. They claimed their canvass returns showed the pensions issue was no longer a negative for the government after the big rises in the basic pension in the pre-Budget report three weeks ago. Millbank claims the Conservatives are now in difficulty over their own pension policy, which includes a commitment to remove the \u00a3200 winter fuel allowance and roll it into the basic pension. Labour ran strong messages claiming the Conservatives would have taken the \u00a3200 away.",

The Kosovo Albanians were not directly represented at yesterday's summit, a glaring omission designed to placate Serbian sensitivities. Mr Kostunica attacked the United States, criticised past EU failures in the Balkans, and talked tough on Kosovo and Montenegro.</p> <p>For the Europeans as for the Croats, Bosnians, and Albanians who have been at war with the Serbs over the past decade, Mr Kostunica's appearance was keenly awaited and closely watched.</p> <p>European officials were disappointed by his performance, aggrieved at his toughness on Kosovo. The other former Yugoslavs were even angrier, searching for some signal of remorse on behalf of the Serbs but finding none.</p> <p>The Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, said that Mr Kostunica's presence in Zagreb did not mean he was making an official visit to Croatia.

      "bodyText": "Tensions between leaders of the various parts of former Yugoslavia and the potential for renewed bloodshed cast a cloud over the unprecedented summit of Balkan and European Union leaders in Zagreb yesterday. As Serbia and Montenegro clashed over the shape of a new rump Yugoslav state, regional politicians moved to put a decade of war and disaster behind them, committing themselves to a new era of cooperation and reconciliation in the Balkans. The scene of improbable promise was set for yesterday's summit after an astonishing year of democratic change in the former Yugoslavia - starting last December with the death of the Croatian strongman, president Franjo Tudjman, and culminating in the overthrow of the Yugoslavpresident, Slobodan Milosevic, last month and the recent victory by moderates in Kosovo elections. But Kosovo and its eventual status remains the biggest bone of contention in former Yugoslavia. The Kosovo Albanians were not directly represented at yesterday's summit, a glaring omission designed to placate Serbian sensitivities. Mr Kostunica attacked the United States, criticised past EU failures in the Balkans, and talked tough on Kosovo and Montenegro. For the Europeans as for the Croats, Bosnians, and Albanians who have been at war with the Serbs over the past decade, Mr Kostunica's appearance was keenly awaited and closely watched. European officials were disappointed by his performance, aggrieved at his toughness on Kosovo. The other former Yugoslavs were even angrier, searching for some signal of remorse on behalf of the Serbs but finding none. The Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, said that Mr Kostunica's presence in Zagreb did not mean he was making an official visit to Croatia. If he had been, said Mr Mesic, \"we would have set totally different demands for him\". The summit's final declaration committed Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania, and Yugoslavia - comprising Serbia and Montenegro - to a new era of \"political dialogue, regional free trade, and close cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs\". \"It is a matter of priority to develop regional cooperation,\" the declaration read. The EU pledged \u20ac4.65bn (\u00a32.8bn) in reconstruction aid for the shattered region over the next six years, although that is hundreds of millions of pounds less than was promised last year when Serbia was still ineligible to gain the funds. In an indirect attack on the preferential treatment that Serbia under Mr Kostunica is seen to be getting from the international community, Mr Mesic stressed the imperative of cooperating with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague and handing over indicted war criminals such as Mr Milosevic, Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, and the former Bosnian Serb leaders, Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. \"It would be illusory to discuss any normalisation without full cooperation with the Hague tribunal, without the individual assignment of guilt which will prevent the creation of myths of collective guilt of any nation,\" said Mr Mesic. Mr Kostunica derides the tribunal as a toy of US policy and has said he will not hand over Mr Milosevic. Several hundred aggrieved Croatian war victims marched outside the conference hall, clutching pictures of Mr Kostunica brandishing a Kalashnikov and calling him a war criminal. But the small protest was vastly outnumbered by riot policemen ordered to contain the slightest hint of trouble. While Mr Kostunica's less-than-conciliatory tone surprised European officials, they pointed out that Serbia faces crucial polls on December 23 and suggested that Mr Kostunica will be given the benefit of the doubt until the political landscape in Serbia is clearer. It was clear that the tense relationship between Serbia and Montenegro could present a flashpoint in the months ahead. President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro said the two were de facto separate countries, that the international community should recognise this, and that he was pushing ahead with laying the ground for an independence referendum. Mr Kostunica, however, warned that any \"unilateral move\" by Montenegro would prove \"disastrous\". But with renewed killings and bombs in the Kosovan provincial capital Pristina this week, and Albanian attacks in the Kosovo buffer zone which left four dead and forced hundreds to flee, the upsurge of violence in Kosovo has overshadowed talk of peace. Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations' administrator in Kosovo - the closest the Kosovo Albanians have come to representation in Zagreb yesterday - warned that the international community was in too much of a hurry to resolve the conflict there. The Montenegrin president agreed that Kosovo would need to be \"an international protectorate\" for years. In the international eagerness to embrace post-Milosevic Serbia, Mr Kouchner warned that the Kosovo Albanians were afraid of becoming \"history's forgotten people\". \"We should remain aware of another political fact,\" Mr Kouchner said. \"The Kosovo Albanians are resolved to never again fall under the former rule.\"",

Does Ford's dilemma with the SUV challenge one of the most popular assumptions in business ethics: that being ethical is not incompatible with the long term interests of a company's owners?</p> <p>These are serious questions, not just for Ford managers, but for others struggling with questions of corporate responsibility. And this is a serious environmental issue. Almost half of all new car sales in the US are now SUVs or light trucks (which have similar emission levels).</p> <p>With engines of up to 8 litres and fuel efficiency as low as 11 mpg this popularity has helped to drive down the average fuel efficiency of all cars on the road in the US since the end of the 1980s. The prize-winning students point out the difficulty for Ford of making the right environmental choices on this issue without damaging the financial bottom line.</p> <p>Last year SUVs represented a fifth of Ford's new vehicle sales. The average profit on them is $12,000 - a 40% margin compared to between 5% and 10% on a typical saloon car. As a result SUVs pulled in $5 billion in profit for Ford last year, more than half the group total.</p> <p>This no doubt explains the group's reluctance to adopt a truly green stance on the issue, rather than the superficial measures which have been taken. For example, the vehicles have been made more recyclable, and emission levels have been reduced. But Ford is reluctant to support US government initiatives to price in the environmental \"externalities\" in an attempt to reduce customer demand, especially for the most polluting models.</p> <p>In fact, on the contrary, the group continues to be a member of a body called the Coalition for Vehicle Choice (CVC), which lobbies against increased emissions and fuel efficiency obligations and against US participation in the UN global climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto three years ago.</p> <p>Warburton and Cardoza say Ford is ducking the issue by being satisfied with a better environmental position than its rivals. What it should be doing, if its environmental rhetoric is serious, is to pull out of the market, or at least the most damaging end of it. \"By adopting a relative rather than absolute set of measures of its environmental impact, Ford is therefore able to develop an ethical stance that does not require it to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the most inefficient SUVs,\" they say.</p> <p>They outline a programme for Mr Ford to rescue his environmental image. The first step would be to withdraw from the CVC and any other lobby groups that seek to obstruct Federal or State level anti-emission and fuel efficiency initiatives. Then Ford should seek out and support groups or researchers who are examining the social and political barriers to greater fuel efficiency. Most fundamentally, the group must work on depressing consumer demand for the most damaging SUVs. While difficult, these steps are not impossible, and could be justified in financial terms</p> <p>Supporting lobbies against greater fuel efficiency leaves Ford open to charges of hypocrisy, which could damage its reputation, while turning its back on the most inefficient vehicles could help build a potent brand image. But the authors conclude with a realistic assessment of the likelihood of such a strategy being adopted: \"The SUV dilemma is challenging but not intractable for Ford.</p> <p>\"Within the current paradigm of business ethics (that ethical behaviour is in the long term interests of shareholders) there is more that the company can economically do to manage their environmental impact. In the absence of the foresight that these types of initiatives require, real change will probably have to wait until the SUV fad is over.\"</p>",

Last year SUVs represented a fifth of Ford's new vehicle sales. The average profit on them is $12,000 - a 40% margin compared to between 5% and 10% on a typical saloon car. As a result SUVs pulled in $5 billion in profit for Ford last year, more than half the group total. This no doubt explains the group's reluctance to adopt a truly green stance on the issue, rather than the superficial measures which have been taken. For example, the vehicles have been made more recyclable, and emission levels have been reduced. But Ford is reluctant to support US government initiatives to price in the environmental \"externalities\" in an attempt to reduce customer demand, especially for the most polluting models. In fact, on the contrary, the group continues to be a member of a body called the Coalition for Vehicle Choice (CVC), which lobbies against increased emissions and fuel efficiency obligations and against US participation in the UN global climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto three years ago. Warburton and Cardoza say Ford is ducking the issue by being satisfied with a better environmental position than its rivals. What it should be doing, if its environmental rhetoric is serious, is to pull out of the market, or at least the most damaging end of it. \"By adopting a relative rather than absolute set of measures of its environmental impact, Ford is therefore able to develop an ethical stance that does not require it to make the difficult decision to withdraw from the most inefficient SUVs,\" they say. They outline a programme for Mr Ford to rescue his environmental image. The first step would be to withdraw from the CVC and any other lobby groups that seek to obstruct Federal or State level anti-emission and fuel efficiency initiatives. Then Ford should seek out and support groups or researchers who are examining the social and political barriers to greater fuel efficiency. Most fundamentally, the group must work on depressing consumer demand for the most damaging SUVs. While difficult, these steps are not impossible, and could be justified in financial terms Supporting lobbies against greater fuel efficiency leaves Ford open to charges of hypocrisy, which could damage its reputation, while turning its back on the most inefficient vehicles could help build a potent brand image. But the authors conclude with a realistic assessment of the likelihood of such a strategy being adopted: \"The SUV dilemma is challenging but not intractable for Ford. \"Within the current paradigm of business ethics (that ethical behaviour is in the long term interests of shareholders) there is more that the company can economically do to manage their environmental impact. In the absence of the foresight that these types of initiatives require, real change will probably have to wait until the SUV fad is over.\"",

Outdoors types already know about Rohan, which makes clothes for rugged wear and travel, but are also popular in town. Their Intercontinental Coat for women costs \u00a3199, is waterproof and lightweight with a detachable quilted lining and hood. Rohan's Globetrotter Mac for men and women also costs \u00a3199 and is so lightweight it can be packed into its own pocket. But if you want a more traditional coat you will find the classic British Mackintosh at Rainmac in West Sussex. The company was set up seven years ago by Michael Orr when he realised how difficult it was to buy a proper rubberised raincoat. Since then the company has taken off and is a big exporter. The coats are made in Scotland in the traditional way, developed in the early 19th century by Charles Mackintosh - who gave the garment its name. The process involves two layers of cloth being glued together with a solution of rubber. A classic trenchcoat for women costs \u00a3215, a riding mac \u00a3235, a hooded cape \u00a3195. Men's coats range from \u00a3183 for the Rochester to \u00a3265 for a riding mac. There is a good choice of colours, a wide range of sizes, and the coats have detachable toning plaid linings made from lambswool. If you can't afford these prices, Rainmac sells a popular lightweight, waterproof coat for \u00a339.99. Waterproof Teflon-coated raincoats for schoolchildren are one of Rainmac's specialities, available in traditional school uniform colours for ages from four years and upwards. Smaller sizes are \u00a314 unlined and \u00a324, lined, for children aged 12 and over coats cost \u00a316 unlined and \u00a327 lined.

      "body": "<p>As share prices sink under concern about the viability of new technology companies and profitability of older suppliers, fundraising by new enterprises continues apace. All sorts of businesses are offering shares in start-up operations that may help to galvanise the economy. That is if they survive.</p> <p>Valuable income tax incentives and capital gains tax reliefs are available to venture capitalists willing to take high risks. Single company investment in Enterprise Investment Schemes involves the highest risk. Most investors go for the spread of investment provided by venture capital and development capital trusts.</p> <p>One of the most popular recent issues with small investors was Old Vic Productions, where well-heeled punters were prepared to cough up several thousands to help out the theatre. The main incentive was tickets and invitations to dress rehearsals and functions where they might meet the stars. As with the single film projects that have raised EIS money, returns will be slow and doubtful. Only enthusiastic \"angels\" willing to suffer total loss may tread such boards.</p> <p>Investment in an EIS business, as in any new company, should be long term. The tax relief of 20 per cent against income tax in the current tax year and exemption from capital gains tax, along with deferral of tax on gains invested in the venture, depends on retention for three years (five years before the last budget).</p> <p>Shares in unquoted traded companies should also qualify for business property relief from inheritance tax. Increasingly EIS companies seek an early listing of shares on the Ofex dealing facility, enabling investors to track their value, though the market may be narrow and erratic.</p> <p>Current EIS issues include e-go systems, one of the largest by value when the funding is completed next week after the previous flotation and takeover this year of Telemesser, an Israeli company in the same business communications field. As an internet operator it might have been affected by the present doubts about the sector, but with nearly a three-year history in messaging and revenues running at over \u00a35m a year, the shares cost three times the figure at which institutions, including VCTs, subscribed a year ago. Telemesser's founders may qualify for a further 10m shares.</p> <p>Timberweb is also established as an internet company providing information and aiming to trade in wood on behalf of users and world-wide suppliers. There are already over 500 members for a modest subscription charge. The shares are on offer at 80p to raise over \u00a36m, making the total capital value \u00a325m. A listing on the Alternative Investment Market will be sought. Golf enthusiasts may be drawn by the small EIS offer of shares in Golf Projects, which provides internet coaching services with a base in three international golf academies. Swing analysis will be a main feature so PC links as well as the outdoor ones will be a preoccupation.</p> <p>The company is well-connected through arrangements with the sports management group IMG and leading players. Just \u00a31m is being sought at 20p a share.

      "bodyText": "As share prices sink under concern about the viability of new technology companies and profitability of older suppliers, fundraising by new enterprises continues apace. All sorts of businesses are offering shares in start-up operations that may help to galvanise the economy. That is if they survive. Valuable income tax incentives and capital gains tax reliefs are available to venture capitalists willing to take high risks. Single company investment in Enterprise Investment Schemes involves the highest risk. Most investors go for the spread of investment provided by venture capital and development capital trusts. One of the most popular recent issues with small investors was Old Vic Productions, where well-heeled punters were prepared to cough up several thousands to help out the theatre. The main incentive was tickets and invitations to dress rehearsals and functions where they might meet the stars. As with the single film projects that have raised EIS money, returns will be slow and doubtful. Only enthusiastic \"angels\" willing to suffer total loss may tread such boards. Investment in an EIS business, as in any new company, should be long term. The tax relief of 20 per cent against income tax in the current tax year and exemption from capital gains tax, along with deferral of tax on gains invested in the venture, depends on retention for three years (five years before the last budget). Shares in unquoted traded companies should also qualify for business property relief from inheritance tax. Increasingly EIS companies seek an early listing of shares on the Ofex dealing facility, enabling investors to track their value, though the market may be narrow and erratic. Current EIS issues include e-go systems, one of the largest by value when the funding is completed next week after the previous flotation and takeover this year of Telemesser, an Israeli company in the same business communications field. As an internet operator it might have been affected by the present doubts about the sector, but with nearly a three-year history in messaging and revenues running at over \u00a35m a year, the shares cost three times the figure at which institutions, including VCTs, subscribed a year ago. Telemesser's founders may qualify for a further 10m shares. Timberweb is also established as an internet company providing information and aiming to trade in wood on behalf of users and world-wide suppliers. There are already over 500 members for a modest subscription charge. The shares are on offer at 80p to raise over \u00a36m, making the total capital value \u00a325m. A listing on the Alternative Investment Market will be sought. Golf enthusiasts may be drawn by the small EIS offer of shares in Golf Projects, which provides internet coaching services with a base in three international golf academies. Swing analysis will be a main feature so PC links as well as the outdoor ones will be a preoccupation. The company is well-connected through arrangements with the sports management group IMG and leading players. Just \u00a31m is being sought at 20p a share. In tennis, Sweatband is offering equipment and similar services, with subscription at 40p a share to raise \u00a31m. Pubs, restaurants and hotels have been part of the EIS scene almost since its inauguration and Close Brothers' sponsorship of English Country Inns to raise an initial \u00a36m at 100p a share keeps up a well-trodden path as the big brewers disintegrate. Although leisure investments have not been among the more successful venture trust investments, the property element should be a safeguard. Sites will be acquired in prosperous southern areas. Quality cheese and Jersey milk products will be produced by Amelca, a new company being sponsored by Matrix Securities, which is also behind many of the other large EIS issues.

However, the Data Protection Act can save customers, particularly those who need lots of old statements, a great deal of money.</p> <p>Under that Act on payment of a \u00a310 fee, anyone is entitled to information about them held on computer by a business. In divorce cases, where parties may be asked to disclose discarded bank statements, this is a useful money-saving device.</p> <p>Surprisingly, some solicitors are not aware of it and their clients end up paying the banks' exorbitant charges. The Act can also be relied on by people who want statements for borrowing or tax purposes. All that is needed is a written request to the institution in question. The Act requires the business to comply \"promptly\" and, in any case, within 40 days from receiving the request.</p> <p>If loss, such as a tax penalty, results from its failure to comply, compensation is payable. When asked about this, a spokesman for the Woolwich conceded that anyone paying the fee could save at least \u00a315 this way. Lloyds TSB said its records were only kept on computer for one year.

      "bodyText": "Last week Jobs &amp; Money highlighted the amounts some banks charge for providing duplicate statements. Among the worst offenders were Lloyds TSB at \u00a35 per sheet for a current account, and the Woolwich at \u00a325 for a mortgage statement. However, the Data Protection Act can save customers, particularly those who need lots of old statements, a great deal of money. Under that Act on payment of a \u00a310 fee, anyone is entitled to information about them held on computer by a business. In divorce cases, where parties may be asked to disclose discarded bank statements, this is a useful money-saving device. Surprisingly, some solicitors are not aware of it and their clients end up paying the banks' exorbitant charges. The Act can also be relied on by people who want statements for borrowing or tax purposes. All that is needed is a written request to the institution in question. The Act requires the business to comply \"promptly\" and, in any case, within 40 days from receiving the request. If loss, such as a tax penalty, results from its failure to comply, compensation is payable. When asked about this, a spokesman for the Woolwich conceded that anyone paying the fee could save at least \u00a315 this way. Lloyds TSB said its records were only kept on computer for one year. Since the Act was reintroduced in 1998 such records can be covered, as well as those on a computer's hard disk. Where there are particular difficulties accessing microfiche records, businesses won't have to comply until 2001. Suitably embarrassed by the revelation that it charges most for duplicates, Lloyds TSB has said it will cap the charge at \u00a310, regardless of the number of statements requested. In reality, complying with a request under the Act is much more expensive and cumbersome for a bank than producing a single statement. Someone who needs a statement may find it threatening to make a request for full information under the Act resulting in the bank agreeing to waive its charge. \u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister",

There was nothing made up about the world of decaying hotels, sleazy capitals and scrofulous villages, he said. This was how most of humanity lived, even if it was alien to western critics reading his novels in the comfort of their middle-class sitting rooms.

      "body": "<p>The European Union was last night trying to contain consumer panic over beef as the first cases of BSE emerged in Germany and the Azores.</p> <p>Only 24 hours earlier, Spain discovered two cows infected with the disease while infection is spreading in France. Twelve European countries have now reported the disease.</p> <p>Reports of the first suspected home-grown BSE case in Germany means the three largest EU herds have the disease. France's 20m cattle account for 25% of the 80m cattle in the EU. Germany has a herd of 18m and Britain 12m.</p> <p>Only Austria, Italy, Sweden and Finland in the EU now have no recorded cases but the European commission in Brussels says this is no cause for complacency.</p> <p>German authorities were last night promising to introduce new controls on animal feed on Monday in an attempt to shore up consumer confidence. Health minister Andrea Fischer admitted that the time for \"sweet talking the situation in Germany is over\".</p> <p>The commission was putting a brave face on the latest crisis, saying cases in new countries came as no surprise. British sources advised against farmers rubbing their hands with glee at the misfortunes of those who questioned the safety of British beef in the 90s.</p> <p>They fear the insidious spread of the disease through Europe can only undermine confidence in meat here and are nervous about a political backlash from European partners who are convinced that Britain exported the problem.</p> <p>The EU health and consumer protection commissioner David Byrne said he would be pressing for \"maximum control measures\" when Europe's agriculture ministers meet on December 4.</p> <p>Mr Byrne said the commission had warned for years of the probability of the spread of BSE to other states. Although parts of cattle most at risk had been removed from cattle in most member states, \"it is only very recently that countries like Germany and Spain have agreed to do so,\" he said.</p> <p>The German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said a full scale ban on feeds containing meat and bone meal was likely to take effect in Germany on Monday after it emerged that a cow born and slaughtered in Germany tested positive for BSE for the first time.</p> <p>It was also announced that BSE had spread to Portugal's mid-Atlantic territory, the Azores through an animal imported from Germany.</p> <p>The developments came amid growing calls in Britain to ban French beef after a claims that infected French beef has found its way into the UK. But the Food Standards Agency chief, Sir John Krebs, said there was insufficient evidence to support an unlawful ban on imports of French beef.</p> <p>That decision is now likely to continue to be the subject of scrutiny following decisions by Spain, Austria, Greece, Italy and Holland to impose partial bans on French beef.</p> <p>There is also some concern about what happens if cases of variant CJD rise across Europe. Eighty-one people have died of the disease in Britain while there has been one death in Ireland and two in France.</p> <p>The commission said last night: \"We think the measures we have in place are sufficiently rigorous but this reinforces the need to implement them fully. The commission never excluded the possibility that there would be cases in countries where there were none up to now. It is not a surprise.\"</p> <p>Britain's beef consumption has been rising since it dived to 740,000 tonnes in 1996, when the link between BSE and vCJD was established.

      "bodyText": "The European Union was last night trying to contain consumer panic over beef as the first cases of BSE emerged in Germany and the Azores. Only 24 hours earlier, Spain discovered two cows infected with the disease while infection is spreading in France. Twelve European countries have now reported the disease. Reports of the first suspected home-grown BSE case in Germany means the three largest EU herds have the disease. France's 20m cattle account for 25% of the 80m cattle in the EU. Germany has a herd of 18m and Britain 12m. Only Austria, Italy, Sweden and Finland in the EU now have no recorded cases but the European commission in Brussels says this is no cause for complacency. German authorities were last night promising to introduce new controls on animal feed on Monday in an attempt to shore up consumer confidence. Health minister Andrea Fischer admitted that the time for \"sweet talking the situation in Germany is over\". The commission was putting a brave face on the latest crisis, saying cases in new countries came as no surprise. British sources advised against farmers rubbing their hands with glee at the misfortunes of those who questioned the safety of British beef in the 90s. They fear the insidious spread of the disease through Europe can only undermine confidence in meat here and are nervous about a political backlash from European partners who are convinced that Britain exported the problem. The EU health and consumer protection commissioner David Byrne said he would be pressing for \"maximum control measures\" when Europe's agriculture ministers meet on December 4. Mr Byrne said the commission had warned for years of the probability of the spread of BSE to other states. Although parts of cattle most at risk had been removed from cattle in most member states, \"it is only very recently that countries like Germany and Spain have agreed to do so,\" he said. The German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said a full scale ban on feeds containing meat and bone meal was likely to take effect in Germany on Monday after it emerged that a cow born and slaughtered in Germany tested positive for BSE for the first time. It was also announced that BSE had spread to Portugal's mid-Atlantic territory, the Azores through an animal imported from Germany. The developments came amid growing calls in Britain to ban French beef after a claims that infected French beef has found its way into the UK. But the Food Standards Agency chief, Sir John Krebs, said there was insufficient evidence to support an unlawful ban on imports of French beef. That decision is now likely to continue to be the subject of scrutiny following decisions by Spain, Austria, Greece, Italy and Holland to impose partial bans on French beef. There is also some concern about what happens if cases of variant CJD rise across Europe. Eighty-one people have died of the disease in Britain while there has been one death in Ireland and two in France. The commission said last night: \"We think the measures we have in place are sufficiently rigorous but this reinforces the need to implement them fully. The commission never excluded the possibility that there would be cases in countries where there were none up to now. It is not a surprise.\" Britain's beef consumption has been rising since it dived to 740,000 tonnes in 1996, when the link between BSE and vCJD was established. Consumption is up to 900,000 tonnes but prices have never recovered to pre-crisis levels, when consumption was well over 1.1bn tonnes. Germany exports about 1,300 tonnes of beef a year to Britain, 77,000 tonnes from Ireland and 4,800 tonnes from France. British officials are visiting France next week to conduct safety checks on beef exported from there. EU-wide bans on the most risky parts of cattle have only just been introduced after years of wrangling and the testing programme is about to be stepped up. Reported cases: Britain 177,465 Ireland 546 (includes 10 imports) Portugal 453 (includes seven imports) Switzerland 364 France 179 (one import) Belgium 18 Germany 7 (six imports) Netherlands 6 Denmark 2 (one import) Liechtenstein 2 Spain 2 Luxembourg 1",

A brick inscribed \"We would not tolerate an illegal government\" was thrown through the windows of Democratic party offices in Broward county, where one of the recounts resumed yesterday. Republican supporters waving \"Sore-Loserman\" placards, some of them bussed in from outside Florida, jostled and heckled reporters and officials in both Broward and Palm Beach counties for a second day as the mood threatened to turn even uglier. The anniversary of Elian Gonzales' ill-fated arrival in Florida brought a reprise of the ugly, hysterical scenes which became the norm at every twist of that legal saga. As tempers deteriorated on both sides, Mr Gore's top lawyer David Boies alleged that a third county, Miami-Dade, had decided to abandon a count which could have been decisive for Democratic hopes after \"mini-riots\". As he did so, a prominent Republican, the Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigot, talked of \"a bourgeois riot\" that would save Mr Bush's presidential hopes. Mounting Republican fury with Mr Gore bristled from the airwaves and on the internet yesterday, triggering accusations of mob rule from Democrats and a claim from socialist activists that Mr Bush's supporters were making \"appeals of a semi-insurrectionary character\" to members of the US armed forces. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of hypocrisy. \"They bring in kids who yell and scream and try to stop things from moving forward,\" Jenny Backus of the Democratic National Committee said. The recounts nevertheless went ahead in Broward and Palm Beach counties yesterday, helping Mr Gore to nibble away at Mr Bush's lead, which fell towards 700 again. In Broward county, officials resumed counting after the Thanksgiving holiday, examining as many as 2,000 questionable ballot papers which had previously been excluded because of difficulties in establishing the voters' intentions. In Palm Beach county, officials were focusing their efforts on some 6,000 questionable ballot papers, examining each one for evidence of intention. Figures were not updated from Palm Beach, although earlier published figures showed a net gain of 14 to Mr Bush. At a hearing before the recount there resumed, William Rouverol, inventor of the controversial Votomatic machine used in the county, unsuccessfully urged the local supervisory board to count partially indented or \"dimpled\" ballots, which would add hundreds of votes to Al Gore's total. Meanwhile, away from the spotlight, four smaller Florida counties published their own revised totals which gave a net gain of 60 votes to Mr Bush. The two counties are aiming to complete their recounts and submit figures to the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris by 5pm tomorrow. Ms Harris can then certify the results of the election tomorrow evening, allowing the victor to claim Florida's 25 electoral college votes and thus the White House. If that man is Mr Bush, Mr Gore has made clear that he will make no concession either tomorrow or any time soon. Lawyers for the Gore camp said they will immediately challenge the certified results in a \"contest action\" on the grounds that Miami-Dade was unable to conduct a legal recount. Such a move could keep the outcome in doubt until well into December. Mr Gore's contest action is only one of a number of possible developments over the coming days which could significantly affect the final outcome in Florida. On Monday, a state appeal court is conducting an emergency hearing on whether a new election should be called in Palm Beach county because some voters were confused by the so-called \"butterfly ballots\" used there. Also on Monday, a court in Seminole county will decide whether to exclude 4,700 postal votes sent out at the instigation of Republican officials rather than of the voters themselves or their relatives, as required by law.

If the Hague compromise is agreed this will become 3% or less. </p> <p>The obstacle is the US insistence that it should be able to meet its target indirectly by growing trees to absorb carbon from the atmosphere rather than by cutting its consumption of carbon-based fuels. </p> <p>Ms Voynet said: \"This would turn the Kyoto agreement, which was negotiated under great difficulties ... into an agreement which would allow increases up to 2010. It will be very difficult to close the loopholes here at a later stage.

      "bodyText": "Heated talks continuing in the Hague last night were expected to produce a watered-down agreement on cutting global warming gases - a backward step which might allow emissions to rise for the next 10 years. As national delegations and green groups voiced their dismay, the French environment minister, Dominique Voynet, said on behalf of the EU: \"This is a step backwards.\" The conference of 180 countries abandoned the attempt to reach a detailed agreement and went on fighting over a broad-brush political statement which could be turned into a legally binding deal later. Three years ago the developed countries agreed at Kyoto, Japan, to cut their emissions by 5.2%. If the Hague compromise is agreed this will become 3% or less. The obstacle is the US insistence that it should be able to meet its target indirectly by growing trees to absorb carbon from the atmosphere rather than by cutting its consumption of carbon-based fuels. Ms Voynet said: \"This would turn the Kyoto agreement, which was negotiated under great difficulties ... into an agreement which would allow increases up to 2010. It will be very difficult to close the loopholes here at a later stage. This is not a step in the right direction.\" The conference of 180 countries was intended to create a legally binding agreement setting maximum emissions from developed countries. Some are allowed increases, but the EU has agreed an 8% cut, the US 7% and Japan 6%. Climatologists say that a reduction of at least 60% is needed to stabilise the climate. Three years of talks were supposed to end at 5pm yesterday, but ministers continued meeting through the night in the hope of agreeing a 14 page political statement. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, heading the British delegation, said: \"We are going to the wire to try and get a deal.\" EU ministers are anxious to get a politically binding agreement, even a weak one, before the Clinton presidency ends. Trying to get any kind of meaningful agreement with a Bush negotiating team is seen as nearly impossible. The talks last night focused on a series of compromises suggested by Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister and president of the meeting, who, a UN spokesman said, told delegates that no final deal was possible and he hoped for a political agreement setting out a broad outline of what countries sought to do.

In circumstances where Nato does not want to become involved and yet we have a need to do peacekeeping operations as we did here in the 1990s, it allows us the option to do so.</p> <p>\"It has been agreed by Nato, it's been agreed by the USA and it simply allows us to do these peacekeeping operations in circumstances where Nato doesn't want to be involved.\"</p> <p>Earlier in Zagreb, the prime minister assailed the Eurosceptics. He said: \"The threat we face is a retreat into narrow-minded nationalism which in the name of misguided patriotism takes our countries backward ... Europe, the present EU and the EU of the future is the standing example that the past need not repeat itself.</p> <p>\"All this is possible provided an enlightened patriotism which sees cooperation and partnership as strength, not weakness, replaces the fear and prejudices of that narrow nationalism.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair won unalloyed backing on the military row from Mr Patten, who told the BBC in Zagreb: \"I disagree with William Hague on this. I think the Conservative party has made a considerable mistake on this.\"</p> <p>Mr Patten also attacked British media coverage of the rapid reaction force specifically and of the EU generally. \"On some front pages these days you see propaganda and not news,\" he said. \"I think what is damaging is that sometimes any attempt to be constructive in Europe is regarded by some newspapers as tantamount to treachery.</p> <p>\"I think the whole debate is quite extraordinary.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister yesterday returned to the offensive over European integration and military cooperation, winning unequivocal support for his stance from Chris Patten, the EU's commissioner for external affairs, who declared that the Tory leader William Hague was wrong about the so-called \"European army\". Mr Blair used a summit of EU and Balkan leaders in the Croatian capital Zagreb to blast his critics in the bitter row over European security as narrow-minded nationalists and misguided patriots. He pointed to the joint military peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo as positive examples of the kind of work which would be taken on by the new and controversial European rapid reaction force. Mr Patten also attacked parts of the British media, describing some coverage of the European military row as \"fabricated and fatuous\". Appearing to target Mr Hague, Mr Blair railed against \"narrow-minded nationalism and misguided patriotism\" and offered a robust defence of government policies on Europe. He went on from Croatia to neighbouring Bosnia to visit British soldiers on peacekeeping duty in Banja Luka, in what appeared to be a calculated attempt to disarm his opponents on the issue of the new 60,000-strong rapid reaction force. Visiting the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment and the Queen's Dragoon Guards, Mr Blair said that the force gave Britain the option to use it where it wanted. \"All the soldiers here are working alongside servicemen of other countries,\" he said. \"It's important people realise what this is all about. In circumstances where Nato does not want to become involved and yet we have a need to do peacekeeping operations as we did here in the 1990s, it allows us the option to do so. \"It has been agreed by Nato, it's been agreed by the USA and it simply allows us to do these peacekeeping operations in circumstances where Nato doesn't want to be involved.\" Earlier in Zagreb, the prime minister assailed the Eurosceptics. He said: \"The threat we face is a retreat into narrow-minded nationalism which in the name of misguided patriotism takes our countries backward ... Europe, the present EU and the EU of the future is the standing example that the past need not repeat itself. \"All this is possible provided an enlightened patriotism which sees cooperation and partnership as strength, not weakness, replaces the fear and prejudices of that narrow nationalism.\" Mr Blair won unalloyed backing on the military row from Mr Patten, who told the BBC in Zagreb: \"I disagree with William Hague on this. I think the Conservative party has made a considerable mistake on this.\" Mr Patten also attacked British media coverage of the rapid reaction force specifically and of the EU generally. \"On some front pages these days you see propaganda and not news,\" he said. \"I think what is damaging is that sometimes any attempt to be constructive in Europe is regarded by some newspapers as tantamount to treachery. \"I think the whole debate is quite extraordinary. It's been whipped up by some of the press ... Much of the reporting is fabricated or fatuous.\" Mr Patten said that claims that European military cooperation was undermining the 51-year-old Nato alliance and would result in a full withdrawal of American troops from Europe was nonsense. \"We are not undermining Nato. Nato has made it perfectly clear it supports what European ministers are doing,\" he said. \"The American administration has made it perfectly clear it supports what we are doing.\" Mr Patten added: \"It's crazy to suggest this is the creation of a European army or an attempt to kick the Americans out of Europe.

      "body": "<p>The largest order ever taken to lengthen a luxury liner was revoked yesterday after the Italian owners of the Costa Classica pulled out of a deal, leaving 26,000 tonnes of steel beached on the docks of the Mersey.</p> <p>The Cammell Laird shipyard, famous for building the aircraft carrier the Ark Royal, was told by Italian cruise operator Costa Crociere that it had postponed delivery of the ship because the work was behind schedule.</p> <p>The people most surprised were the 30 Cammell Laird workers on the cruise ship Costa Classica, who were heading for home yesterday off the coast of Spain and looking forward to tomorrow's float of a huge new section for the ship at their yard in Birkenhead.</p> <p>Suddenly, around 3pm, as they cruised off La Coruna, scene of one of Nelson's naval triumphs, they were told that the ship's owners, Costa Crociere, had cancelled the \u00a351m contract for \"jumboisation\" and they would be put off the vessel in Spain while the ship turned around and headed back to Genoa.</p> <p>Came the dawn, as they prepared to fly back to Merseyside, the shell-shocked crew members realised it was not only their own jobs that looked insecure but those of 1,000 colleagues at Birkenhead and the future of the company that employed them - a group reborn from the ashes of Britain's once-great shipbuilding industry.</p> <p><b> Crisis meetings</b><br></p> <p>Alerted by company executives, union leaders and local MPs began a series of crisis meetings late on Thursday to salvage the contract to build and fit a 45-metre extension to the 56,000-ton Costa Classica: cutting it in half and inserting the new section in the middle. It is billed as the world's biggest cruise ship conversion.</p> <p>But by 8am, as he flew out from Marseille, where Cammell has recently acquired a stake in Europe's biggest repair dock, the company's deputy chief executive, Brett Martin, knew he had a fight on to save the entire company. The shares had been holed below the bottom-line and, as he landed in Luton, were down 36%; Cammell had lost \u00a365m of its value, it was down to \u00a3112m and possibly ripe for takeover.</p> <p>\"We were shocked and surprised,\" he said, waiting for his flight to the north-west of England as he handled calls on his mobile phone from worried investors, fellow executives, MPs and union officials. Cammell had already lost out last month on the government's \u00a31.2bn order for six ferries to transport troops overseas - because its order book was booming.</p> <p><b> 'Sick'</b><br></p> <p>By the time he reached Birkenhead, the scene awaiting him resembled the industrial disputes of the 1980s. At 3.15pm, early finishing time on Friday, dockers marched out of the yard with woollen hats pulled down tight over furrowed brows and hands pushed deep into donkey jackets. \"This is sick,\" said one shipyard worker, carrying his boots and overalls across the potholed car park to his car.</p> <p>But this time the dispute was not between unions and governments. It was between Britain and Italy. The Italian ship-owners had applied for arbitration to find out whether they could postpone or even terminate the contract, arguing that the work was substantially behind schedule and efforts to resolve the dispute commercially had failed.</p> <p>Behind Cammell Laird's giant metal dock bays sat the 26,000-tonne midsection. It was beached on the dry dock with its funnels lit with a string of lights like a stranded Christmas cruise ship waiting for a bow and stern. Across the Mersey, Liverpool's two vast cathedrals looked tiny in comparison.</p> <p>\"This is crisis time,\" said David Hulfe, GMB senior shop steward, outside the gates.</p> <p>\"It has just come out of the blue. We were in the yard today ready to accept the ship. Now the company is talking about this going to arbitration. Christmas is just around the corner and these workers don't know what the future holds. It's not just the shipyard jobs, it's the spin off for small local businesses. Taxi firms, pubs and shops all benefit from us and they would suffer without us.\"</p> <p>Mr Martin embarked on a damage-limitation exercise, arguing that the alleged delays were little or nothing. \"We believe we have got a robust defence and the group is performing well. I can't pretend this is not a big disappointment but it's not the end of the world.\"</p> <p>But he was forced to concede that, with between 700 and 800 of the Birkenhead workforce employed on the disputed contract, lay-offs were inevitable. \"The yard was completely committed to this project which is not going to happen and we don't have any bookings over the Christmas/New Year period ...

      "bodyText": "The largest order ever taken to lengthen a luxury liner was revoked yesterday after the Italian owners of the Costa Classica pulled out of a deal, leaving 26,000 tonnes of steel beached on the docks of the Mersey. The Cammell Laird shipyard, famous for building the aircraft carrier the Ark Royal, was told by Italian cruise operator Costa Crociere that it had postponed delivery of the ship because the work was behind schedule. The people most surprised were the 30 Cammell Laird workers on the cruise ship Costa Classica, who were heading for home yesterday off the coast of Spain and looking forward to tomorrow's float of a huge new section for the ship at their yard in Birkenhead. Suddenly, around 3pm, as they cruised off La Coruna, scene of one of Nelson's naval triumphs, they were told that the ship's owners, Costa Crociere, had cancelled the \u00a351m contract for \"jumboisation\" and they would be put off the vessel in Spain while the ship turned around and headed back to Genoa. Came the dawn, as they prepared to fly back to Merseyside, the shell-shocked crew members realised it was not only their own jobs that looked insecure but those of 1,000 colleagues at Birkenhead and the future of the company that employed them - a group reborn from the ashes of Britain's once-great shipbuilding industry. Crisis meetings Alerted by company executives, union leaders and local MPs began a series of crisis meetings late on Thursday to salvage the contract to build and fit a 45-metre extension to the 56,000-ton Costa Classica: cutting it in half and inserting the new section in the middle. It is billed as the world's biggest cruise ship conversion. But by 8am, as he flew out from Marseille, where Cammell has recently acquired a stake in Europe's biggest repair dock, the company's deputy chief executive, Brett Martin, knew he had a fight on to save the entire company. The shares had been holed below the bottom-line and, as he landed in Luton, were down 36%; Cammell had lost \u00a365m of its value, it was down to \u00a3112m and possibly ripe for takeover. \"We were shocked and surprised,\" he said, waiting for his flight to the north-west of England as he handled calls on his mobile phone from worried investors, fellow executives, MPs and union officials. Cammell had already lost out last month on the government's \u00a31.2bn order for six ferries to transport troops overseas - because its order book was booming. 'Sick' By the time he reached Birkenhead, the scene awaiting him resembled the industrial disputes of the 1980s. At 3.15pm, early finishing time on Friday, dockers marched out of the yard with woollen hats pulled down tight over furrowed brows and hands pushed deep into donkey jackets. \"This is sick,\" said one shipyard worker, carrying his boots and overalls across the potholed car park to his car. But this time the dispute was not between unions and governments. It was between Britain and Italy. The Italian ship-owners had applied for arbitration to find out whether they could postpone or even terminate the contract, arguing that the work was substantially behind schedule and efforts to resolve the dispute commercially had failed. Behind Cammell Laird's giant metal dock bays sat the 26,000-tonne midsection. It was beached on the dry dock with its funnels lit with a string of lights like a stranded Christmas cruise ship waiting for a bow and stern. Across the Mersey, Liverpool's two vast cathedrals looked tiny in comparison. \"This is crisis time,\" said David Hulfe, GMB senior shop steward, outside the gates. \"It has just come out of the blue. We were in the yard today ready to accept the ship. Now the company is talking about this going to arbitration. Christmas is just around the corner and these workers don't know what the future holds. It's not just the shipyard jobs, it's the spin off for small local businesses. Taxi firms, pubs and shops all benefit from us and they would suffer without us.\" Mr Martin embarked on a damage-limitation exercise, arguing that the alleged delays were little or nothing. \"We believe we have got a robust defence and the group is performing well. I can't pretend this is not a big disappointment but it's not the end of the world.\" But he was forced to concede that, with between 700 and 800 of the Birkenhead workforce employed on the disputed contract, lay-offs were inevitable. \"The yard was completely committed to this project which is not going to happen and we don't have any bookings over the Christmas/New Year period ... There's a very big chance that a good proportion of them will be laid off.\" Mr Martin and his fellow directors own 30% of Cammell and have expanded the group's activities to the north-east of England and to the west cost of the US, to Oregon. But its core yard, Birkenhead, is now dependent on government aid for lucrative contracts to build two cruise ships for US group Luxus - the return of shipbuilding to the Mersey for the first time in many years. \"We have every reason to believe we can turn this company around and if we get the Luxus contract this will give us the security to go aggressively forward,\" he said. Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, said: \"It is very serious that the Italians have reneged on the contract. It is incredibly worrying for the workforce, as this is one of the most successful workforces in the country. It is very serious that a workforce like this should be so dependent on the capriciousness of the Italian firm.\" Asked if there would be job losses, he said: \"Well there obviously won't be any overtime worked.\" Luxury line started as humble olive firm Costa Crociere, the Italian cruise line which has scuppered Cammell Laird's Birkenhead yard, pitches unashamedly for the wealthy seafarer.

      "bodyText": "A government scheme to take the stress out of buying a home could leave buyers and sellers out of pocket, it was claimed yesterday. The criticism came after the housing minister, Nick Raynsford, unveiled a radical shake-up of the housing market with the possible introduction of sellers' information packs aimed at speeding up sales. Under the scheme people would be required to put together a \"seller's pack\" containing a survey, a draft contract and search details before they put their home on the market. This would give buyers access to vital information when they viewed a property and avoid them having to pay for a survey. Speaking yesterday in Bristol, where a government pilot study of the scheme involving 189 transactions has been carried out, Mr Raynsford said that he was convinced the package was a good way forward. But housing market experts said the scheme could have disastrous consequences for home-owners and those seeking to buy. At a likely cost of between \u00a3500 and \u00a3700, sellers' packs could make people in areas with low property prices more reluctant to sell. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) suggested the Bristol study had been flawed, with less than 100 homes actually being sold, of which 30 were new properties. It also claimed that the small print of the study revealed that 30 buyers had been unhappy with the reports provided in the packs on the condition of properties, choosing to pay for their own survey instead. The council added that the packs were likely to put off owners who simply wanted to test the market, and could effectively kill off the housing market in low income areas. Michael Coogan, CML director general, said: \"While we support the idea of buyers and sellers being more prepared early on, the evidence in support of introducing sellers' information packs is not robust and such packs could prove unpopular.\" Dominic Toller, of the Bristol and West Building Society, said the pilot study was too narrowly focused and produced no evidence that the scheme would tackle the problem of gazumping. \"Some aspects of the scheme are quite worrying. The housing pack is a report produced by the seller, but actually is going to be used by the buyer and the lender,\" he said. The Law Society said the seller's survey was not necessary, and was unlikely to be relied on by a mortgage lender or buyer. Michael King, chairman of its conveyancing and land law committee, added: \"The seller's survey will not be regarded as impartial and will be viewed with suspicion by the buyer, as it will only provide a very basic review of the property.\" Mr Raynsford said the government was determined to forge ahead with reform despite criticism from mortgage lenders, estate agents and the Law Society. During the eight-month pilot, some 87% of accepted offers on properties with a seller's pack resulted in a sale compared with 72% under the present system. Three sides of propery buying triangle Buyer Recruitment consultant Tracey Dando, 26. \"My fiancee and I bought our flat in May last year in Redlands, Bristol, for \u00a3150,000 and we found the property pack gave us information you don't normally get as a buyer.

      "body": "<p>As someone who experienced the horror of repeated sexual and physical abuse as a child I was pleased to see your leader (November 23) acknowledge the frightening extent of the problem. While agreeing that child poverty in Britain is a terrible indictment, and that every effort should be made to irradicate it, I do not think that this will secure an end to child abuse. Sexual and physical abuse of children cuts across class boundaries, and this fact needs to be fully accepted.</p> <p>The NSPCC should also be thanked for its attempt to talk about the high levels of abuse perpetrated by children. Dea Birkett (Why little boys are not sex offenders, November 21) seems determined to deny the possibility that children can, and do, physically and sexually abuse other children. Once again, the perpetrator and victim are most commonly living in the same house. It was my experience that a regime of sadistic abuse thrived in what would have appeared to the outside world as a happy household, and continued unchallenged in the culture of shame and silence that abuse so often seems to foster. The fact that my abuser was only five years, rather than 25 years, older than me, is of little comfort. Such things do go on - even in nice middle-class homes.</p> <p>Now, when I look at my own children, I hope that with clear and straightforward guidance about themselves, their bodies and feelings, they may be able to reach adulthood without becoming either a victim or a perpetrator of abuse.</p> <p>We need to find ways to explicitly teach our children how to respect themselves and those around them. The sense that my own experience leaves me with (and the tenor of much of the public debate on child abuse seems to confirm) is that we prefer to ignore or deny other people's (and our own) vulnerability and suffering rather than acknowledge it and take the necessary action that springs out of that. <br><b>Name and address supplied</b></p> <p>\u0095 Dea Birkett appears to be exhorting parents to \"be afraid... be very afraid\" of some of the results emerging from the recent NSPCC survey on child maltreatment. Her article is doing exactly what she accuses the NSPCC's research of doing - misrepresenting facts and worrying parents unnecessarily. In fact the NSPCC survey has confirmed what has been known by professionals for some time, that at least 30% of all sexual abuse of children is perpetrated by other children and young people. Our experience with nearly 300 children and young people who are over sexualised or sexually abusive confirms that they are, indeed, usually well known to their victims, may be relatives and have many other emotional and behavioural problems which need professional help.</p> <p>Birkett's piece will be most unhelpful to troubled parents and carers worried about what to do with persistent, compulsively sexualised children whose behaviour is not normal, which they cannot control and who pose major management problems. Parents and carers of persistently sexualised children need to know that they should bring children for professional help and advice as early as possible since treatment and advice on management will help to stop these behaviours and prevent the behaviour escalating into something more serious. <br><b>Dr Eileen Vizard</b> <br>NSPCC Young Abusers Project</p> <p>\u0095 Your leader about child abuse rightly emphasised this should be given a much higher profile. However, I suggest there will be no lessening of this secret evil until the issue is properly tackled in schools. This can be accomplished by providing \"safe havens\" or discussion groups in which young people can voice their doubts and fears about a whole range of personal and social matters. <br><b>Robert K McKechnie</b> <br>Sidmouth, Devon</p> <p>\u0095 Given the scale of child abuse referred to in your leader, I would like to make three points on behalf of paediatricians: there are children being abused today who depend on doctors to initiate concern about child abuse which then requires multi-disciplinary assessment to establish the facts about a particular child; medical diagnosis is visited by uncertainly unless and until the facts have been established; professional guidelines and procedures will only have limited impact on the suffering inflicted by child abuse while doctors (and others) run the risk of being pilloried if no facts emerge to support the initial concern.</p> <p>The government could extend its record on child welfare by enacting mandatory reporting laws (in place elsewhere in the world) for professionals and public alike in relation to concerns about child abuse. <br><b>GP Wyatt</b> <br>Consultant paediatrician, South Cleveland hospital</p>",

      "bodyText": "As someone who experienced the horror of repeated sexual and physical abuse as a child I was pleased to see your leader (November 23) acknowledge the frightening extent of the problem. While agreeing that child poverty in Britain is a terrible indictment, and that every effort should be made to irradicate it, I do not think that this will secure an end to child abuse. Sexual and physical abuse of children cuts across class boundaries, and this fact needs to be fully accepted. The NSPCC should also be thanked for its attempt to talk about the high levels of abuse perpetrated by children. Dea Birkett (Why little boys are not sex offenders, November 21) seems determined to deny the possibility that children can, and do, physically and sexually abuse other children. Once again, the perpetrator and victim are most commonly living in the same house. It was my experience that a regime of sadistic abuse thrived in what would have appeared to the outside world as a happy household, and continued unchallenged in the culture of shame and silence that abuse so often seems to foster. The fact that my abuser was only five years, rather than 25 years, older than me, is of little comfort. Such things do go on - even in nice middle-class homes. Now, when I look at my own children, I hope that with clear and straightforward guidance about themselves, their bodies and feelings, they may be able to reach adulthood without becoming either a victim or a perpetrator of abuse. We need to find ways to explicitly teach our children how to respect themselves and those around them. The sense that my own experience leaves me with (and the tenor of much of the public debate on child abuse seems to confirm) is that we prefer to ignore or deny other people's (and our own) vulnerability and suffering rather than acknowledge it and take the necessary action that springs out of that. Name and address supplied \u0095 Dea Birkett appears to be exhorting parents to \"be afraid... be very afraid\" of some of the results emerging from the recent NSPCC survey on child maltreatment. Her article is doing exactly what she accuses the NSPCC's research of doing - misrepresenting facts and worrying parents unnecessarily. In fact the NSPCC survey has confirmed what has been known by professionals for some time, that at least 30% of all sexual abuse of children is perpetrated by other children and young people. Our experience with nearly 300 children and young people who are over sexualised or sexually abusive confirms that they are, indeed, usually well known to their victims, may be relatives and have many other emotional and behavioural problems which need professional help. Birkett's piece will be most unhelpful to troubled parents and carers worried about what to do with persistent, compulsively sexualised children whose behaviour is not normal, which they cannot control and who pose major management problems. Parents and carers of persistently sexualised children need to know that they should bring children for professional help and advice as early as possible since treatment and advice on management will help to stop these behaviours and prevent the behaviour escalating into something more serious. Dr Eileen Vizard NSPCC Young Abusers Project \u0095 Your leader about child abuse rightly emphasised this should be given a much higher profile. However, I suggest there will be no lessening of this secret evil until the issue is properly tackled in schools. This can be accomplished by providing \"safe havens\" or discussion groups in which young people can voice their doubts and fears about a whole range of personal and social matters. Robert K McKechnie Sidmouth, Devon \u0095 Given the scale of child abuse referred to in your leader, I would like to make three points on behalf of paediatricians: there are children being abused today who depend on doctors to initiate concern about child abuse which then requires multi-disciplinary assessment to establish the facts about a particular child; medical diagnosis is visited by uncertainly unless and until the facts have been established; professional guidelines and procedures will only have limited impact on the suffering inflicted by child abuse while doctors (and others) run the risk of being pilloried if no facts emerge to support the initial concern. The government could extend its record on child welfare by enacting mandatory reporting laws (in place elsewhere in the world) for professionals and public alike in relation to concerns about child abuse.

      "body": "<p>Claims Direct yesterday blamed \"adverse media coverage\" for forcing it to set aside \u00a35m to hand out to disgruntled customers. </p> <p>News of the payments by the \"no win, no fee\" insurance compensation chaser drove its shares down 44p to close at 140p, well below the 180p price at which they were floated in July and their 353.5p peak in September. </p> <p>Many Claims Direct customers thought they were entitled to reclaim the insurance premium they had to pay when the company agreed to act for them.

Many Claims Direct customers thought they were entitled to reclaim the insurance premium they had to pay when the company agreed to act for them. They are able to do so under the Access to Justice Act passed last year - but only for cases which started after April 1 this year. Claims Direct said yesterday that in some cases started before April 1 damages received by customers had been substantially reduced by the client's inability to fully recover insurance premiums from defendants.

A grand staircase leads to the upper dining area, where champagne will be served at the bar.</p> <p>The concept of the \"cruise ship of the skies\", to recapture the halcyon days of the great liners crossing the Atlantic, was conjured up yesterday by the makers of the world's largest jumbo, the A3XX, which unveiled a mock-up of the 555-seat airliner at the Airbus Toulouse headquarters in France.</p> <p>The seats are well padded and can fold into beds, now commonly accepted as part of the deal for premier class travellers. A shower room is fitted, although the designers admit that water supplies will be limited because of weight.</p> <p>Robert Lange, A3XX marketing director, said a casino and duty-free shopping area could be built into the huge belly of the 80 metre long aircraft, depending on the demands of the airline - Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Air France are already committed - or it could be turned into an expansive cargo area.</p> <p>The A3XX mock-up did not extend to the upper deck, where 400 economy passengers will be placed. A dark void, more than half the size of a football pitch, stretched into the distance.

      "bodyText": "The tinkling sounds of a pianist in evening suit should soothe any last remaining tensions from passengers as they lounge in the thickly carpeted salon, surrounded by bookcases and subdued lighting. A grand staircase leads to the upper dining area, where champagne will be served at the bar. The concept of the \"cruise ship of the skies\", to recapture the halcyon days of the great liners crossing the Atlantic, was conjured up yesterday by the makers of the world's largest jumbo, the A3XX, which unveiled a mock-up of the 555-seat airliner at the Airbus Toulouse headquarters in France. The seats are well padded and can fold into beds, now commonly accepted as part of the deal for premier class travellers. A shower room is fitted, although the designers admit that water supplies will be limited because of weight. Robert Lange, A3XX marketing director, said a casino and duty-free shopping area could be built into the huge belly of the 80 metre long aircraft, depending on the demands of the airline - Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Air France are already committed - or it could be turned into an expansive cargo area. The A3XX mock-up did not extend to the upper deck, where 400 economy passengers will be placed. A dark void, more than half the size of a football pitch, stretched into the distance. The luxuries of first class will not be experienced by most passengers, but Airbus did promise an inch more leg room than its rival, the Boeing 747, to alleviate fears of \"economy class syndrome\". More videos were promised as well. The A3XX will divide economy from premier class passengers, so that neither need see each other. \"It's a bit like the upstairs, downstairs idea, and will be unique to the A3XX,\" said an Airbus official. According to Mr Lange, the A3XX will be quieter than any other aircraft and will carry 35% more passengers than the Boeing 747. Airlines who go down the budget route by dispensing with the niceties of the first class cabin will be able to cram in up to 850 economy travellers. The proposed stretch version of the aircraft can be designed to seat up to 1,000, but that is a decade away. During the planning process, Airbus has been negotiating with the world's 50 leading airports to make sure that the A3XX will be able to land when it flies commercially for the first time in 2006. Mr Lange said that the cost of adapting New York's JFK airport was around \u00a380m, but that Heathrow might be able to include it in current costs and that its landing charges would remain unchanged. The airport operator, BAA, said that it was planning to accommodate the A3XX by altering the airport. BAA said it was vital for the arrival of the A3XX that Terminal 5 was built, but that terminals 3 and 4 would be able to receive the aircraft.",

      "body": "<p>Kim Tavares is part white, part black and part Latino so when she goes into a nice house, she says, she doesn't know whether to buy it, steal from it or clean it. </p> <p>Tavares is performing in the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, one of nine stand-ups on show tonight. What is remarkable is that every single one of the nine - black, white, Latino, male, female - talks about race. Bill Clinton is still very popular with black voters, says (black) Jimmy Walker, because he is the \"baddest\" president they have ever had and they can \"identify with his philandering ways\". </p> <p>(Latino) Freddy Lopo used to get thrown out of restaurants in Texas by owners asking if he wanted bean-flavoured pancakes and he reckons that the nation is defined by the food it eats - \"Latinos eat beans, black people eat water-melons and white people eat everyone else's food.\" May May (black/Asian) gets grief from her friends who say that black women shouldn't go out with white men and vice versa. Barry Diamond (white) imitates a black prisoner talking about how white people smell like \"wet chicken\". </p> <p>Some of the comedians focus on a drunk in the front row whose racial identity they want to know - \"you're Latino, you can't be called Sam\", he is told. He turns out to be Japanese-Hawaiian so that at least half of him can be offended by a later imitation of a Japanese kamikaze fighter pilot. What is remarkable about the jokes - although there might have to be a steward's inquiry as to whether they all qualified as \"jokes\" - was that most depended on negative stereotypes: Latinos as lazy, dope-smoking cleaners, Japanese as sadists, Chinese as incapable of mastering the English language, Arabs as sexual predators, whites as uptight wannabes with no identities of their own. </p> <p>In the last couple of months, three films which deal head on with racial stereotypes and comedy have come out. This month sees the US publication of One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux) which I think is a remarkable exploration of race in America and one which examines, in its three-part history of the white, black and native American experience, the issue of racial comedy with all its undertones. (I add the \"I think\" because I have known the author, Scott Malcomson, for many years.)</p> <p> Race and comedy are intertwined as never before in the US. What is the great unspoken of the political debate is now chief topic of conversation in the world of comedy. The most provocative of the films is Spike Lee's Bamboozled, starring Damon Wayans and Savion Glover, a very pointed and uncomfortable satire on black people in the entertainment industry. It tells the story of a rather precious, Harvard-educated black television executive told by his white boss to come up with a new programme idea.</p> <p> He develops the notion of using black actors in minstrel \"blackface\", little realising that what he thought was a subversive idea will turn into a hit show. Just to demonstrate how delicate a subject this is, the ads for the film, which showed \"pickaninnies\" eating watermelon, prompted calls from some African-American groups in Los Angeles for a boycott because the images were so demeaning. </p> <p>Thus Lee's angry protest against damaging stereotypes ran into its own angry protest against damaging stereotypes. The film, as Stephen Holden, reviewing it in the New York Times, put it, \"poses unanswerable questions about black identity, assimilation and the give and take between white and black culture\".</p> <p> As he notes, \"the laughter it provokes is the kind that makes you squirm. But that's what good satire is supposed to do. Out of discomfort can come insight.\" In Spike Lee's other new film, The Original Kings of Comedy, the documentary of four leading black comedians in concert, (released in Britain this week), many of the jokes told by Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac rely on a shared acceptance of racial differences. </p> <p>When some of the few white people in the audience are spotted in the front rows, they are teased for coming early because they are frightened that black people will have pinched their seats and they want to avoid a confrontation. Blacks will be arriving late, the audience is told, because they hope that there will be a chance for just that kind of confrontation. </p> <p>There are jokes about how white the film Titanic was, how no black band would have played on as the ship went down, how they would have been unplugging their amps and heading for the boats, how Jesus must have been black because he turned water into wine at a wedding. </p> <p>The third film is I'm the One That I Want which stars Margaret Cho, who also produced it. She is probably the only Korean-American stand-up comedienne to have had her own primetime television show when still in her 20s, to have been forced to go on a crash diet to keep the show and then to have hit the path of booze and drugs before finding salvation as a stand-up once more. </p> <p>She is certainly the only Korean-American stand-up to have dated Quentin Tarantino, to have been told she was a disgrace to her people and to have been hailed as the greatest gay icon since Judy Garland. Cho, the daughter of a couple who ran a bookshop in San Francisco, was partly inspired by Richard Pryor.</p> <p> In 1994, she was cast in the lead role in a sitcom, playing herself. ABC hoped it would be the breakthrough Asian sitcom in a country where TV habits still divide substantially by race. But the network had its own ideas of what a nice Asian girl should be like. Initially, Cho accommodated them by cutting out the very rude stuff about her family.

      "bodyText": "Kim Tavares is part white, part black and part Latino so when she goes into a nice house, she says, she doesn't know whether to buy it, steal from it or clean it. Tavares is performing in the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, one of nine stand-ups on show tonight. What is remarkable is that every single one of the nine - black, white, Latino, male, female - talks about race. Bill Clinton is still very popular with black voters, says (black) Jimmy Walker, because he is the \"baddest\" president they have ever had and they can \"identify with his philandering ways\". (Latino) Freddy Lopo used to get thrown out of restaurants in Texas by owners asking if he wanted bean-flavoured pancakes and he reckons that the nation is defined by the food it eats - \"Latinos eat beans, black people eat water-melons and white people eat everyone else's food.\" May May (black/Asian) gets grief from her friends who say that black women shouldn't go out with white men and vice versa. Barry Diamond (white) imitates a black prisoner talking about how white people smell like \"wet chicken\". Some of the comedians focus on a drunk in the front row whose racial identity they want to know - \"you're Latino, you can't be called Sam\", he is told. He turns out to be Japanese-Hawaiian so that at least half of him can be offended by a later imitation of a Japanese kamikaze fighter pilot. What is remarkable about the jokes - although there might have to be a steward's inquiry as to whether they all qualified as \"jokes\" - was that most depended on negative stereotypes: Latinos as lazy, dope-smoking cleaners, Japanese as sadists, Chinese as incapable of mastering the English language, Arabs as sexual predators, whites as uptight wannabes with no identities of their own. In the last couple of months, three films which deal head on with racial stereotypes and comedy have come out. This month sees the US publication of One Drop of Blood: The American Misadventure of Race (Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux) which I think is a remarkable exploration of race in America and one which examines, in its three-part history of the white, black and native American experience, the issue of racial comedy with all its undertones. (I add the \"I think\" because I have known the author, Scott Malcomson, for many years.) Race and comedy are intertwined as never before in the US. What is the great unspoken of the political debate is now chief topic of conversation in the world of comedy. The most provocative of the films is Spike Lee's Bamboozled, starring Damon Wayans and Savion Glover, a very pointed and uncomfortable satire on black people in the entertainment industry. It tells the story of a rather precious, Harvard-educated black television executive told by his white boss to come up with a new programme idea. He develops the notion of using black actors in minstrel \"blackface\", little realising that what he thought was a subversive idea will turn into a hit show. Just to demonstrate how delicate a subject this is, the ads for the film, which showed \"pickaninnies\" eating watermelon, prompted calls from some African-American groups in Los Angeles for a boycott because the images were so demeaning. Thus Lee's angry protest against damaging stereotypes ran into its own angry protest against damaging stereotypes. The film, as Stephen Holden, reviewing it in the New York Times, put it, \"poses unanswerable questions about black identity, assimilation and the give and take between white and black culture\". As he notes, \"the laughter it provokes is the kind that makes you squirm. But that's what good satire is supposed to do. Out of discomfort can come insight.\" In Spike Lee's other new film, The Original Kings of Comedy, the documentary of four leading black comedians in concert, (released in Britain this week), many of the jokes told by Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac rely on a shared acceptance of racial differences. When some of the few white people in the audience are spotted in the front rows, they are teased for coming early because they are frightened that black people will have pinched their seats and they want to avoid a confrontation. Blacks will be arriving late, the audience is told, because they hope that there will be a chance for just that kind of confrontation. There are jokes about how white the film Titanic was, how no black band would have played on as the ship went down, how they would have been unplugging their amps and heading for the boats, how Jesus must have been black because he turned water into wine at a wedding. The third film is I'm the One That I Want which stars Margaret Cho, who also produced it. She is probably the only Korean-American stand-up comedienne to have had her own primetime television show when still in her 20s, to have been forced to go on a crash diet to keep the show and then to have hit the path of booze and drugs before finding salvation as a stand-up once more. She is certainly the only Korean-American stand-up to have dated Quentin Tarantino, to have been told she was a disgrace to her people and to have been hailed as the greatest gay icon since Judy Garland. Cho, the daughter of a couple who ran a bookshop in San Francisco, was partly inspired by Richard Pryor. In 1994, she was cast in the lead role in a sitcom, playing herself. ABC hoped it would be the breakthrough Asian sitcom in a country where TV habits still divide substantially by race. But the network had its own ideas of what a nice Asian girl should be like. Initially, Cho accommodated them by cutting out the very rude stuff about her family. After the first show was aired, her then boyfriend, Tarantino, rang her to tell her: \"You let them take your voice away!\" She was sent to an \"Asian consultant\" to help her be \"more Asian\". Finally, the show was cancelled and Cho took a familiar toxic escape route. Now, five years on, she has cleaned up and bounced back. In her new film, she recounts this whole adventure in the form of a stand-up stage act in front of her adoring fans. She thinks it is no coincidence that much of the most innovative comedy is coming from outside the white world. \"Stand-up comedy is an outsider art so it's natural that this should happen,\" she says. \"Race is such a part of the cultural consciousness here that it always has to be addressed [in shows].\" She talks in her act of what it was like travelling as an Asian woman in Tennessee and in Florida, where she felt that the only way to feel at home was to seek out the nearest dry-cleaner (often run in the US by Korean-Americans.)

      "body": "<p>From an objective point of view, the newly announced military cooperation among the members of the European Union makes excellent sense. A giant on the world stage in economic and cultural terms, the EU is a diplomatic and especially military pygmy because of its lack of cooperation in these spheres. The point of military cooperation is not aggrandisement or sabre-rattling. It is that Europe should be able to take armed humanitarian and peacekeeping action when required, as in the Balkans, where the disarray of its response was paid for in the lives, grief and misery of that region's people. </p> <p>The advantages of cooperation depend on cases. Agatha Christie remarked that co-authors of books each believe they get all the worry for only half the royalties, which if true undermines the gain. Cooperation in small-scale endeavours often results in delay, inefficiency, and all the disadvantages commonly attendant on miniature democracy, encapsulated in those familiar but sterling truisms about what happens when committees design horses and too many cooks fill the kitchen. But these are precisely the cases where the parties are not benefiting from attempts at cooperation, as Euripides required, which of course means that they are not really cooperating at all . </p> <p>But where there are clear advantages from joint endeavour, it is folly not to accept them. Some people place such high value on autonomy that they would rather be worse off alone than better off together. Such is the view of those who oppose closer ties in Europe. Their chief argument is that cooperative action in the diplomatic and military spheres constitutes movement towards loss of national self-determination and identity. But this argument and the assumptions it makes are equally flawed. </p> <p>The argument is a so-called \"slippery slope argument,\" which says that because there is a continuum between a given action performed now, and a possible state of affairs at the far end of a connecting chain - for example: beginning an addictive habit like smoking could end in heroin dependency - you should not take that first step. But it is immediately obvious that since not all first steps lead to the possible end result, it is a fallacy to repudiate the first step on the grounds that it might. The anti- European argument about military cooperation sees it as leading inevitably to a standing European army, which in turn requires a European state, the terminus of the process of European integration - the very thing to which its opponents are most bitterly hostile. </p> <p>The assumption behind the argument, as these last points show, is that European integration is undesirable, the usual grounds being that it means the loss of national independence, which in turn (so anti-Europeans believe) means loss of \"identity\". But the idea of a \"nation\" is vague; there is no automatic reason why, if such things as nations exist, their being detached from one another is a good thing; and anyway cultural identities can happily flourish independently of the political arrangements they are associated with. These thoughts show that the argument's assumptions are at the very least questionable. </p> <p>Yet even if one granted the anxieties that prompt people to accept this argument, the idea of cooperation is not affected by them, for it is quite another matter. Sovereign states can cooperate without losing their autonomy or identity - in fact, most of the states of the world do so all the time in respect of trade, tourism, air travel, health regulations, and very much besides, to everyone's benefit. If there were no such cooperation life would be poorer, infinitely more difficult, and much more dangerous - because when states are jealous of their own, and shun links with others, the only sure result is suspicion and tension. </p> <p>It feels odd to preach the virtues of international cooperation when its advantages are so obvious.

      "bodyText": "From an objective point of view, the newly announced military cooperation among the members of the European Union makes excellent sense. A giant on the world stage in economic and cultural terms, the EU is a diplomatic and especially military pygmy because of its lack of cooperation in these spheres. The point of military cooperation is not aggrandisement or sabre-rattling. It is that Europe should be able to take armed humanitarian and peacekeeping action when required, as in the Balkans, where the disarray of its response was paid for in the lives, grief and misery of that region's people. The advantages of cooperation depend on cases. Agatha Christie remarked that co-authors of books each believe they get all the worry for only half the royalties, which if true undermines the gain. Cooperation in small-scale endeavours often results in delay, inefficiency, and all the disadvantages commonly attendant on miniature democracy, encapsulated in those familiar but sterling truisms about what happens when committees design horses and too many cooks fill the kitchen. But these are precisely the cases where the parties are not benefiting from attempts at cooperation, as Euripides required, which of course means that they are not really cooperating at all . But where there are clear advantages from joint endeavour, it is folly not to accept them. Some people place such high value on autonomy that they would rather be worse off alone than better off together. Such is the view of those who oppose closer ties in Europe. Their chief argument is that cooperative action in the diplomatic and military spheres constitutes movement towards loss of national self-determination and identity. But this argument and the assumptions it makes are equally flawed. The argument is a so-called \"slippery slope argument,\" which says that because there is a continuum between a given action performed now, and a possible state of affairs at the far end of a connecting chain - for example: beginning an addictive habit like smoking could end in heroin dependency - you should not take that first step. But it is immediately obvious that since not all first steps lead to the possible end result, it is a fallacy to repudiate the first step on the grounds that it might. The anti- European argument about military cooperation sees it as leading inevitably to a standing European army, which in turn requires a European state, the terminus of the process of European integration - the very thing to which its opponents are most bitterly hostile. The assumption behind the argument, as these last points show, is that European integration is undesirable, the usual grounds being that it means the loss of national independence, which in turn (so anti-Europeans believe) means loss of \"identity\". But the idea of a \"nation\" is vague; there is no automatic reason why, if such things as nations exist, their being detached from one another is a good thing; and anyway cultural identities can happily flourish independently of the political arrangements they are associated with. These thoughts show that the argument's assumptions are at the very least questionable. Yet even if one granted the anxieties that prompt people to accept this argument, the idea of cooperation is not affected by them, for it is quite another matter. Sovereign states can cooperate without losing their autonomy or identity - in fact, most of the states of the world do so all the time in respect of trade, tourism, air travel, health regulations, and very much besides, to everyone's benefit. If there were no such cooperation life would be poorer, infinitely more difficult, and much more dangerous - because when states are jealous of their own, and shun links with others, the only sure result is suspicion and tension. It feels odd to preach the virtues of international cooperation when its advantages are so obvious. It is a measure of the influence of nationalists, and of the mindset of those who are swayed by them, that we find ourselves repeating truisms as if they were discoveries.",

You must know someone who'd love a tote bag emblazoned with the Romanov dynasty's double-headed imperial eagle, or a sparkly little something inspired by the Russian crown jewels. Imagine how mum's eyes will light up as she unwraps a plate based on Wedgwood's Green Frog service, with its 1,222 views of 18th-century England. </p> <p>These are some of the souvenirs on sale at the Hermitage Rooms, the gallery that opens today in London's revamped Somerset House. It is tempting to dismiss them as vulgar, but they are a fair reflection of the spirit of the inaugural show, Treasures of Catherine the Great. </p> <p>Catherine II, Empress and Autocrat of All Russia, was the world's greatest shopper - or collector, as rich obsessives prefer to call themselves. Between the coup that put her on the throne in place of her husband in 1762 and the stroke that laid her out in her toilet in 1796 she picked up more than 4,000 Old Masters, 10,000 engraved gems, 16,000 antique coins and medals, at least 38,000 books, and many, many thousands of drawings. She had Rembrandts and Rubens and Watteaus; Lorrains and Murillos and Raphaels, most picked up in job lots abroad. </p> <p>In 1779 Britain lost what might have become the core of a national collection when she struck a deal with the grandson of Sir Robert Walpole, the country's first prime minister. Despite protests in parliament, she spirited away 204 of the works that Walpole had acquired, including a number of Rubens and Van Dycks. One of the Poussins from that spree, Moses Striking the Rock, has returned to Britain as part of the show. </p> <p>Money was never a problem: first Catherine stripped the clergy of their property and turned them into state employees, gaining a third of Russia's land and serfs, then she used diplomacy and conquest to expand her tax base by 200,000 square miles. When she played cards with her friends, the chips were diamonds. </p> <p>It wasn't just objects that Catherine collected: generous, intelligent and well-read, she was popular with philosophers and writers such as Diderot and Baron von Grimm, both of whom acted as her art scouts, and Voltaire, with whom she corresponded for 15 years. She saw herself as completing the process begun by Peter the Great, a moderniser who liked to say that he had opened a \"window on the west\". A Wedgwood plaque in the exhibition depicts her as Minerva, Roman goddess of learning, \"rewarding art and protecting commerce\". </p> <p>What she couldn't buy, Catherine had made, like the Green Frog dinner service, 14 pieces of which are on display in London. Russia was going through a Gothic phase when she commissioned it, so she asked Wedgwood to include ruins among the landscapes that decorate the full 944-piece set. Always keen to display her country's wealth to its snooty European neighbours, she must have been delighted when Queen Charlotte came to view the service just before it was shipped to Russia. </p> <p>Between 1769 and 1787 Catherine had a series of galleries built beside the Winter Palace in St Petersburg. This light and airy complex was known as the Hermitage because it was a place where she could retreat from the pressures of state. London's Hermitage Rooms are an attempt to re-create a \"lost wing\" of that, with marquetry floors by a St Petersburg firm, replica crystal chandeliers, even ruched blinds sewn by the Hermitage's housekeeper. The first of the six chambers features a live video feed from Palace Square in St Petersburg, a film of the Hermitage's luxurious interior, and touch-screen computers offering a virtual tour. One pound of the \u00a36 admission fee will go to the cash-strapped State Hermitage Museum. </p> <p>The London outpost never had a hope of matching the grandeur of the original: Somerset House was built to the scale of civil servants, not imperial majesties. Yet the 500 objects on display provide a fasci nating and disturbing insight into 18th-century Russia. </p> <p>Among many portraits of the empress is Vigilius Eriksen's Equestrian Portrait of Catherine II. She is on her horse Brilliant (Russian for \"Diamond\") on the summer's day in 1762 when she set out from St Petersburg to demand the abdication of her weak, stupid and unpopular husband, Peter III. Her backers included her lover, Count Grigory Orlov, and one of his successors, Prince Grigory Potemkin. Her sword is drawn, and she would clearly be happy to use it on her husband. Peter caved in, but within days had been murdered by his wife's supporters. She claimed he had died of one of \"his habitual haemorrhoidal attacks, together with a violent colic\". </p> <p>Nearby hangs Potemkin, the best-known of Catherine's lovers, in armour for Johann-Baptist Lampi the Elder's portrait. An outstanding statesman and soldier, Potemkin annexed the Crimea for his sovereign. The pair were lovers for just two years but may have secretly married. When the relationship was over, he remained her closest confidant. After his death, Catherine described him as \"brave at heart, brave in thought, brave in soul\". </p> <p>Potemkin's portrait rubs shoulders with several of Catherine's other lovers, including Orlov, who was with her for 12 years until she grew sick of his infidelities. As if to remind us that even imperial adultery has consequences, we have Carl Ludwig Christineck's portrait of their son, the mischievous-looking Count Alexey Bobrinsky, born while she was still married to Peter and smuggled away to be raised far from the court. The exhibition's excellent catalogue informs us that Catherine hid the pregnancy under the bulky mourning robes she wore after the death of Peter's aunt, the Empress Elizabeth. </p> <p>But what steals the show is the dazzling display of gewgaws and trinkets and thingumabobs, just a tiny portion of what Catherine bought, was given or inherited. Enough dinner services that you'd think she didn't know crockery could be reused. Enough snuffboxes that you wonder she didn't sneeze to death. Enough hairpins and dangly bits of jewellery that you imagine her clanking in a high wind. </p> <p>The craftsmanship is breathtaking, above all in James Cox's table clock of gold, silver, agate and crystal, set with jewels and resting on four gold rhinoceroses, and the Chinese hairpins in the form of phoenixes and songbirds. The lines of some of the cameos are so assured that it's hard to tear your eyes away. But it is harder still to forget that while the empress was flashing her cash, most of her subjects were little better than slaves. Catherine's conspicuous consumption is often portrayed as a means of raising Russia's status in the west, but even this glimpse of her fortune makes that seem like an excuse. Every brushstroke, every loop of filigree rings like a slap in the face of common humanity. </p> <p>By Russian standards, Catherine was an enlightened ruler. She tried to end serfdom (though she ended up extending it). She tried to create a liberal constitution (though that was never implemented). Born and brought up in Prussia like the husband she ousted, she might easily have been seen as another foreign interloper, yet she was popular among her subjects. But the opulence of this show drives home how much more she could have done for them. </p> <p>In 1777 Johann Gottlieb Scharff made Catherine a snuffbox featuring a beautiful enamel miniature of her favourite pet dog, a greyhound called Lisetta. The box is in London, alongside others bearing childhood portraits of Grand Dukes Paul, Alexander and Constantine. The dog is at the centre of not one but two circles of diamonds each as big as peas, surrounded by hundreds of smaller gems. It makes you think of that other great shopper, Imelda Marcos, and her shoe collection. As a spectacle it's thrilling; as a demonstration of priorities it stinks. </p> <p>\u0095 Treasures of Catherine the Great is at the Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House, London WC2 (020-7845 4630), until next September.

It's a shame that Barbara is so terrible since Gwen Taylor has always reminded me of my mum. And Duty Free was so very jolly - her finest moment, perhaps. This isn't remotely fine. Nor is it the finest moment for Sam Kelly (that would be 'Allo 'Allo), or Elizabeth Carling (pretending to be Dervla Kirwan in Goodnight Sweetheart), or indeed Mark Benton. He put in a star turn in Anderson, a new sitcom piloted in Channel 4's Comedy Lab, which, if there's any justice, will be given a series. As it is, he may have to put up with the indignity of this twaddle. The way actors better known for other sitcoms have been piled in here indicates that calling Barbara a hearse isn't doing it justice. To be fair, it's more like one of those wagons they used to put plague victims on before taking them to be buried or burnt. Elizabeth Carling has lovely hair, though.",

      "body": "<p>Talk about squashing quarts into pint pots! Remembrance of Things Past, at the National Theatre, is an adaptation by Harold Pinter and Di Trevis of Pinter's own Proust screenplay written in 1972; and that itself, was a distillation of the 3,500 pages of Proust's oceanic novel. Yet, despite my reservations about adaptations, it works. By the end of the evening, when all the characters inhabiting Marcel's memory assemble on stage, you feel you have gained valuable insight into the nature of Proust's obsessions. </p> <p>It would be pointless to bang on about what is lost. Characters and episodes from the novel are sacrificed as well as Proust's essays on time, memory, etiquette and sexuality. From the screenplay, one also loses the dense web of visual and aural references: in the film script there are 35 shots before a word is spoken, during which Pinter establishes the crucial sights and sounds that form the matrix of Marcel's memory. </p> <p>Rather than dwell on what is missing, it is more profitable to ask what a staging of Proust can possi bly add to our understanding. Two things leapt out at me from Trevis's fluid and inventive production. One is the sense that Proust's narrator, Marcel, is both a participant in and observer of his own life. Even when Sebastian Harcombe's Marcel is not physically engaged in a scene, you are aware of him as a silent watcher - as if everything is leading to the play's climactic line: \"It was time to begin.\" The stage version also heightens the aspect of Proust most often neglected, his gift for Balzacian social comedy and astute awareness of the dynamics of class. </p> <p>Mercifully, Pinter and Trevis eschew buttonholing, first-person narration. But, from the start, they make it clear that we are being admitted to Marcel's memory: we get a stumble in the street, a flurry of snow, the ring of a garden-gate bell. Even if this doesn't possess the richness of the screenplay, it establishes the basic convention. Marcel's constant physical presence also reinforces the point Pinter made in his introduction to the film script - that the events shown offer a contrasting movement towards disillusion and revelation \"rising to where time that was lost is found and fixed forever in art\". </p> <p>But theatre depends on the interaction of human beings in a confined space. By staging Proust, one heightens his awareness of social comedy and historical time. He was writing about France during the Third Republic and about the showdown between an ascendant bourgeoisie and a declining aristocracy. It was a battle of rank and status being fought out in fashionable salons. And, while some see Proust as an elitist snob, Walter Benjamin was nearer the truth when he talked of \"the hardness of his work, the intransigence of a man who is ahead of his class\". </p> <p>This Proustian hardness is what comes out most strongly here. The opening party at the Guermantes' house in 1921 represents the vindictive triumph of the bourgeoisie: aristocrats gossip on gilt-framed chairs about death and decay, and a haggard vicomtesse staggers by high on cocaine while the newly-risen hostess engages avant-garde dancers to provide a chic cabaret. </p> <p>Proust, you feel, had an equal dislike for both the declining bluebloods and the emergent bour geoisie. In Time Regained, he writes: \"I had seen enough of fashionable society to know that it is there one finds real illiteracy and not, let us say, among electricians.\" </p> <p>This version also pinpoints the emotional coarseness in smart salons. One of the best scenes comes when Duncan Bell's wonderfully melancholic Swann tells the Duchesse de Guermante he will not be able to accompany her on an Italian holiday because of his impending death; her husband is far more horrified by the discovery that the duchesse is wearing black shoes with a red dress. </p> <p>But adaptation is also a form of self-revelation; and one of the themes Pinter excavates in Proust is the ultimate unknowability of the sexually desired. Marcel is haunted by Albertine's possible lesbianism and Trevis's production makes this a dominant motif. The scenes at Balbec are beautifully done, with the band of sailor-suited girls forming a playful, caressing coterie. And, after Albertine's death, Marcel's interrogation of her friend Andr\u00e9e about their putative sapphism is played from multiple angles. The emphasis on male insecurity and sexual ambivalence, while deriving from Proust, echoes Pinter's Old Times. </p> <p>Inevitably in a stage adaptation, it takes time for the Proustian pattern to become clear: we get fragments of Marcel's memory, which only make total sense at the end - when he itemises the sights and sounds that unlock his past and when Alison Chitty's design reveals the complete version of Vermeer's View of Delft, which has haunted the evening. But each episode is rendered with clarity and there is a clutch of fine performances from David Rintoul as a floridly dignified Baron Charlus, Fritha Goodey as Swann's faithless but beautiful Odette, Janine Duvitski as the upwardly mobile Madame Verdurin and Jill Johnson as a succession of high-chinned aristocratic snobs. </p> <p>It may not be the whole of Proust; but the evening offers a vivid, lovingly created theatrical epitome that highlights his ruthless social comedy and his obsession with what Beckett called \"that double-headed monster of damnation and salvation - Time\". </p> <p>\u0095 In rep at the Cottesloe, London SE1.

      "bodyText": "Talk about squashing quarts into pint pots! Remembrance of Things Past, at the National Theatre, is an adaptation by Harold Pinter and Di Trevis of Pinter's own Proust screenplay written in 1972; and that itself, was a distillation of the 3,500 pages of Proust's oceanic novel. Yet, despite my reservations about adaptations, it works. By the end of the evening, when all the characters inhabiting Marcel's memory assemble on stage, you feel you have gained valuable insight into the nature of Proust's obsessions. It would be pointless to bang on about what is lost. Characters and episodes from the novel are sacrificed as well as Proust's essays on time, memory, etiquette and sexuality. From the screenplay, one also loses the dense web of visual and aural references: in the film script there are 35 shots before a word is spoken, during which Pinter establishes the crucial sights and sounds that form the matrix of Marcel's memory. Rather than dwell on what is missing, it is more profitable to ask what a staging of Proust can possi bly add to our understanding. Two things leapt out at me from Trevis's fluid and inventive production. One is the sense that Proust's narrator, Marcel, is both a participant in and observer of his own life. Even when Sebastian Harcombe's Marcel is not physically engaged in a scene, you are aware of him as a silent watcher - as if everything is leading to the play's climactic line: \"It was time to begin.\" The stage version also heightens the aspect of Proust most often neglected, his gift for Balzacian social comedy and astute awareness of the dynamics of class. Mercifully, Pinter and Trevis eschew buttonholing, first-person narration. But, from the start, they make it clear that we are being admitted to Marcel's memory: we get a stumble in the street, a flurry of snow, the ring of a garden-gate bell. Even if this doesn't possess the richness of the screenplay, it establishes the basic convention. Marcel's constant physical presence also reinforces the point Pinter made in his introduction to the film script - that the events shown offer a contrasting movement towards disillusion and revelation \"rising to where time that was lost is found and fixed forever in art\". But theatre depends on the interaction of human beings in a confined space. By staging Proust, one heightens his awareness of social comedy and historical time. He was writing about France during the Third Republic and about the showdown between an ascendant bourgeoisie and a declining aristocracy. It was a battle of rank and status being fought out in fashionable salons. And, while some see Proust as an elitist snob, Walter Benjamin was nearer the truth when he talked of \"the hardness of his work, the intransigence of a man who is ahead of his class\". This Proustian hardness is what comes out most strongly here. The opening party at the Guermantes' house in 1921 represents the vindictive triumph of the bourgeoisie: aristocrats gossip on gilt-framed chairs about death and decay, and a haggard vicomtesse staggers by high on cocaine while the newly-risen hostess engages avant-garde dancers to provide a chic cabaret. Proust, you feel, had an equal dislike for both the declining bluebloods and the emergent bour geoisie. In Time Regained, he writes: \"I had seen enough of fashionable society to know that it is there one finds real illiteracy and not, let us say, among electricians.\" This version also pinpoints the emotional coarseness in smart salons. One of the best scenes comes when Duncan Bell's wonderfully melancholic Swann tells the Duchesse de Guermante he will not be able to accompany her on an Italian holiday because of his impending death; her husband is far more horrified by the discovery that the duchesse is wearing black shoes with a red dress. But adaptation is also a form of self-revelation; and one of the themes Pinter excavates in Proust is the ultimate unknowability of the sexually desired. Marcel is haunted by Albertine's possible lesbianism and Trevis's production makes this a dominant motif. The scenes at Balbec are beautifully done, with the band of sailor-suited girls forming a playful, caressing coterie. And, after Albertine's death, Marcel's interrogation of her friend Andr\u00e9e about their putative sapphism is played from multiple angles. The emphasis on male insecurity and sexual ambivalence, while deriving from Proust, echoes Pinter's Old Times. Inevitably in a stage adaptation, it takes time for the Proustian pattern to become clear: we get fragments of Marcel's memory, which only make total sense at the end - when he itemises the sights and sounds that unlock his past and when Alison Chitty's design reveals the complete version of Vermeer's View of Delft, which has haunted the evening. But each episode is rendered with clarity and there is a clutch of fine performances from David Rintoul as a floridly dignified Baron Charlus, Fritha Goodey as Swann's faithless but beautiful Odette, Janine Duvitski as the upwardly mobile Madame Verdurin and Jill Johnson as a succession of high-chinned aristocratic snobs. It may not be the whole of Proust; but the evening offers a vivid, lovingly created theatrical epitome that highlights his ruthless social comedy and his obsession with what Beckett called \"that double-headed monster of damnation and salvation - Time\". \u0095 In rep at the Cottesloe, London SE1.

      "bodyText": "White Shield is back. The classic bottle-fermented India Pale Ale, first brewed by William Worthington in Burton-upon-Trent in the 19th century, has enjoyed a peripatetic life in recent years, trundled around the Bass empire before being licensed to King &amp; Barnes in Sussex in 1998. The K&amp;B version was voted the Guardian/Camra Bottled Beer Of The Year in August, but the brewery closed in the same month. White Shield has now returned to its native town, and is brewed with loving care by Steve Wellington in his tiny pilot brewhouse in the Bass Museum. Steve has recreated many lost Bass beers, and has ensured that White Shield is brewed properly to style, using two Bass house yeasts, one for primary fermentation and a second for bottle fermentation. Brewed with pale and crystal malts and Challenger and Goldings hops, the 5.6% beer has a big, fruity hop and biscuity malt aroma, with rich malt, sultana fruit and bitter hops in the mouth, and a long finish that turns dry and hoppy. It's in a Safeway near you for \u00a31.79.",

Not since the 1976 vintage of a grower called Blaise Carron have I tasted a beaujolais such as that one - or not until very recently, that is, more of which in a moment. Beaujolais became a fashionable wine in the early 70s, and at around that time beaujolais nouveau came to be regarded as something rather chic - so much so that it spawned a quite fatuous annual race across the Channel that became little more than an excuse to charge high prices for insipid wines.

      "body": "<p>In more than a decade of writing about supermarkets and their wines, I have never received a letter regarding Budgens (unlike the deluge of correspondence concerning every other retailer). I am inclined to think few readers shop there, except in an emergency, but if you do venture inside, may I point you in the direction of the best-value red wine in store? This is the non- vintage Premium Oaked Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc, costing \u00a33.99. It is rich, dry, characterful, blackcurranty and plummy, with a healthy thwack of Midi sun. It rates 15.5 points out of 20.</p> <p>I had never heard of Morrisons until northern readers demanded that I get off my backside and investigate, and now, of course, the emporia bearing this proud name are a regular feature. My backside has endured bicycle saddles, car seats and railway carriages en route to one branch or another of this increasingly adventurous retailer. If you are passing a branch and want a delicious white wine for smoked fish and open minds, I suggest you investigate Faircape Chenin Blanc 2000 (15.5 points), from South Africa, which is a blistering bargain: apricot edged and lemon flecked, with a tightly knitted texture. It costs just \u00a32.99.</p> <p>Somerfield, another retail curiosity I did not know about until readers gave me the shove, has a stunning South African, too (though not at every branch - call 0117 935 6669 for details). This is Bellingham Pinotage 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.49), which exhibits marvellous tannins of such lush exoticism that even Lafite would be impressed. This is an exciting, satisfyingly deep and tasty wine of dash and panache.</p> <p>Somerfield has some other fascinating bargains. Bellingham Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from South Africa, is a high-class, high-wire act in which fine acids tiptoe along a fine wire of gooseberry-rich fruit. Delicately poised yet potent, this is a lovely wine. La Solitude Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape 1998 (17 points, \u00a39.49) offers classic red velvet upholstery - characterful and biting, in spite of its plushness - and it has immense and lasting charm.

      "bodyText": "In more than a decade of writing about supermarkets and their wines, I have never received a letter regarding Budgens (unlike the deluge of correspondence concerning every other retailer). I am inclined to think few readers shop there, except in an emergency, but if you do venture inside, may I point you in the direction of the best-value red wine in store? This is the non- vintage Premium Oaked Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc, costing \u00a33.99. It is rich, dry, characterful, blackcurranty and plummy, with a healthy thwack of Midi sun. It rates 15.5 points out of 20. I had never heard of Morrisons until northern readers demanded that I get off my backside and investigate, and now, of course, the emporia bearing this proud name are a regular feature. My backside has endured bicycle saddles, car seats and railway carriages en route to one branch or another of this increasingly adventurous retailer. If you are passing a branch and want a delicious white wine for smoked fish and open minds, I suggest you investigate Faircape Chenin Blanc 2000 (15.5 points), from South Africa, which is a blistering bargain: apricot edged and lemon flecked, with a tightly knitted texture. It costs just \u00a32.99. Somerfield, another retail curiosity I did not know about until readers gave me the shove, has a stunning South African, too (though not at every branch - call 0117 935 6669 for details). This is Bellingham Pinotage 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.49), which exhibits marvellous tannins of such lush exoticism that even Lafite would be impressed. This is an exciting, satisfyingly deep and tasty wine of dash and panache. Somerfield has some other fascinating bargains. Bellingham Sauvignon Blanc 2000 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from South Africa, is a high-class, high-wire act in which fine acids tiptoe along a fine wire of gooseberry-rich fruit. Delicately poised yet potent, this is a lovely wine. La Solitude Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape 1998 (17 points, \u00a39.49) offers classic red velvet upholstery - characterful and biting, in spite of its plushness - and it has immense and lasting charm. Normans Old Vines Grenache 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99, at selected stores) is among the tastiest under-a-fiver Aussie reds around. It has great depth and soft pliability, with piles of character from the tannins.

This is a magnificent wine for game and, looking ahead somewhat, that festive fowl. Prior to that sort of fare, smoked fish is the traditional offering, and to accompany this I would nudge you in the direction of Waitrose's Hungarian Deer Leap Dry White 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a32.99), which is superbly fresh and crisp. I became familiar with Sainsbury when it opened a giant branch in Kensal Green, opposite the grave of the English cleric Sydney Smith (a place of pilgrimage), and the retailer has some bargains until December 2: Chilean Cabernet Merlot (16 points, three-litre box, down to \u00a313.99) has oodles of flavour, toffeed and blackcurranty, with good acids and fine tannins. It is both a great food wine and a great quaffer; indeed, it is the niftiest boxed red I've slurped.

In the city, comparatively few homes are purpose-built for contemporary domestic life, so we are left to recycle the existing buildings, converting structures that were supposed to serve another purpose or domestic age.</p> <p>It is no longer just a question of mutating decommissioned warehouses and factories into lofts. A similar approach to re-configuring old carcasses has spread to other types of building. The reincarnation of the town house is especially interesting. After all, in its typical form, the rigid corsetry of the cellular room plan - with polite divisions between front and back, upstairs and downstairs - was built to reinforce the hierarchy of the Victorian family and serve a very different domestic age from our own, an age when a bathroom was a rare commodity and the kitchen banished to the servants' quarters - well removed from ideas of convenience and comfort that have shaped the modern, servant-less home.</p> <p>But, despite all this, the town house has proved a surprisingly durable model. One reason is the nature of the facade. The uniformity of the typical terrace might give the impression of inflexibility, but paradoxically it is exactly this that has contributed to its longevity. While the facade pays lip service to the formality of another age, in some cases it has become little more than a disguise, concealing all manner of alterations to the interior.</p> <p>The London home of architect Richard Rogers has been an influential example of what could be called facadism. The radical reworking of neighbouring white stucco houses illustrates how far (with expertise and an extensive budget) the town house can be re-ordered to suit contemporary needs. While the stucco fronts look much like the rest of the street, inside is another story: a party wall has been removed and the interiors joined at first- and second-floor level to make a cavernous, double-height living space, its proportions more reminiscent of industrial conversions than terraced houses.</p> <p>One side-effect of extreme conversions is a sometimes bizarre contrast between the old and the new - white stucco shielding a space-age kitchen. In the case of an utterly banal semi in a stretch of London where urban takes on suburban spread, this has grown to schizophrenic proportions. What was once a family home has morphed into two elegantly open floors - one for living and one for sleeping - designed for a couple. If stairs are one feature of the town house that has been constantly evolving in attempts to reduce intrusion and maximise floor space, here a conventional enclosed hall and stairs have been replaced by an open industrial metal version hijacked from the aeronautical industry. It might seem strange when you step through the front door, but the disjuncture between outdoors and indoors quickly becomes part of the thrill.</p> <p>The allotment of space reveals current priorities: the bathroom (which occupies two bedrooms) and kitchen are of the same generous size. The bathroom is not just a place to wash but also serves as private boudoir, wardrobe and laundry storage, providing support for the open-plan living.</p> <p>In both these examples, the original house has been reduced to little more than a shell, a container for a very different way of life than the original builders could possibly have conceived, where formality has been replaced by the informality of less structured living spaces.</p> <p>The dismantling of the cellular room plan began with the Modernist attack on conventional domesticity. Writing on The Dwelling As A Problem, in 1930, the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto railed against the tyranny of conventional domestic planning: \"A dwelling is an area which should offer protected areas for meals, sleep, work and play.

Increasingly, the planning of today's domestic interiors - whether loft conversion or re-ordered town house - is concerned with creating more hybrid, flexible living spaces that reflect conflicting desires for open space and privacy, the personal and the shared, the social and the territorial, freedom and enclosure.</p> <p>In the renovation of a narrow town house in Antwerp, Belgian architect Vincent Van Duysen takes a different approach. Instead of eradicating the house's original character, the vertical stack of small rooms has been preserved. This contrasts with a muscular, modern rear extension, the original wonky wooden stairs acting as a link between the old and new parts.</p> <p>Instead of horizontal open space, the double-height extension - with a dining area on one level, a mezzanine sitting area above this and roof terrace on top - plays on the eccentric changes of height and levels that often characterise town houses.</p> <p>In Slim House, Pierre d'Avoine's proposal for low-cost terraced housing, the idea of the independent facade is taken to a logical extreme.

There is a search slot to find gossip about celebrities. I entered 'Tanya Millbank'; the reply was, 'There are no matches for Tanya Millbank.' True enough, but I don't think I'll visit the site again. (tanya@gorgeoustanya.co.uk; www.gorgeoustanya.co.uk)",

Verbal skills above average.' - extract from official descriptions of Guy Georges.</p> <p>A report by four psychiatrists on Guy Georges, self-confessed murderer of seven lively, intelligent young women, all stabbed to death with butchers' knives, evokes a far more vivid and blood-curdling image than the precise but matter-of-fact language of the verbal identikit. The doctors portray a lone psychopathic killer, prowling through the Paris night, planning the destruction of victims chosen out of the crowd for their evident confidence, energy. He needed, say the analysts led by Dr Henri Grynzspan, to \"feed on the energy and vital force of those who submitted to his power. What was unbearable for him was the other person's successful life, which reflected his own feelings of frustration and failure.\" </p> <p>The psychiatrists, carried away by a fascination for a man who hid his real nature even from his numerous girlfriends, concluded that the killings amounted to \"a ritual of vampirisation\" - a sensationally macabre image that will feed popular hatred and fear when Georges appears at the Paris assizes in the New Year. The details of Georges's crimes, including a dozen other rapes and knifings, suggest he is France's most dangerous and methodical murderer since Dr Marcel Petiot attracted fleeing Jews to his Paris surgery during the war to rob them and burn their bodies in his apartment stove. In France, although criminal cases are heard before juries, the juries include three judges as well as civilians, and the publication of detailed evidence and even presumptions of guilt - which would be considered grossly prejudicial in the British judicial system - are legally permitted. </p> <p>\"Georges's victims did not exist as people, only as objects to support his perverse attempts to appropriate their inner qualities,\" the psychiatrists decided. In their report they explore at length the details of the way he used his knife \"in a surgical sense of the term to cut away clothes and underclothes\", before rape and throat-slitting. </p> <p>Because there seemed no light of salvation among Georges's alleged crimes, I began to look closer at the case to find flaws in a simplistic summary - on one side a sadistic assassin and on the other a group of young women thrust into the public eye through their brutal death. Among the darkness, there was a glimmer of sympathetic insight into Georges's motivation: Georges was abandoned by his mother when he was six, and the identity of his father was concealed from him by a legal manoeuvre described by psychiatrists as \"genealogical death\", which they consider central to his later development. There was also a recognition of the innumerable shockwaves following in the wake of multiple crimes: unreported traumas that have so deeply marked families, police and lawyers that their inner lives, humanity and self-confidence have been shaken forever. </p> <p>I reported for the Guardian on the panic and terror caused by Georges's multiple killings before he was identified, but it was not until police rugby-tackled him outside the Blanche metro station, Paris, in March 1998 as the chief suspect that I was made aware of a family link. My daughter, Claire, knew him well, liked him and recognised him as the amiable \"peacemaker\" in a number of squats. He was a lukewarm hanger-on in her section of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale du Travail (CNT), an anarcho-syndicalist movement, and benefited from its amateur social work for those living on the margins. </p> <p>With another 50 or so drifters, Georges was first sighted at a militant squat in the residential rue Didot on the left bank in 1995, and he used the Saint Vincent de Paul welfare centre as his address. Later, after claiming to have been recently released for armed robbery, he took a vague interest in the leftwing demonstrations of a loosely affiliated collectif of protest groups while joining in all-night raves in the vast cellars at the rue Didot, where drink, drugs and sex were easily available. </p> <p>As far as women were concerned, he was charming and protective, Claire said, particularly if they were mentally distressed. And he had lots of girlfriends (one of whom, Sandrine, recalled that he made love to her on average eight times a day and constantly talked about starting a family). Squats, where everyone had a social problem or a secret, were not so much Georges's refuge as his natural environment. No one had to prove their credentials, justify their past lives or explain their absences, which, for Georges, included living rough in Amsterdam and London. </p> <p>\"Joe\", as he called himself in homage to the malevolent Injun in Tom Sawyer, followed this mixed bunch of restless activists, junkies and misfits from temporary refuge to temporary refuge for more than two years, carrying his drumsticks in a back pocket, boasting of fabricated criminal exploits and expressing hatred of homosexuals and skinheads. </p> <p>Philippe Dusanter, a CNT militant and hospital psychiatrist who corresponds with Joe in La Sant\u00e9 prison, was completely taken in by Georges's \"Belmondo-style attitude - the real cool small-time crook who said he had just been released from 13 years for a bank hold-up\". \"He was helpful, coherent, polite and easy-going, ready to arbitrate in disputes, particularly when our political activity was transferred to a block in the rue Saint Sauveur, a filthy squat near Les Halles,\" says Dusanter. \"He didn't identify himself with average squatters - he saw them as human wrecks. No one suspected him of sexual crimes. But, on looking back, we remembered that he had wept on three occasions that coincided with murders. He told a friend that relatives had died.\" These incidents recall Georges's own remark to police that, \"if a man killed a woman, he would probably weep\". </p> <p>If no one asked \"Joe\" where he came from or where he disappeared to, they also ignored an unsuspected clue to his origins when he spoke admiringly of his father, supposedly a Nato general and war hero. The references were put down to fantasies over his \"illegitimate\" birth. Even after his arrest, the press referred to his origins as French West Indian and his father's real identity was not revealed until two years of interrogation ended - a disclosure that had a profound effect on Georges's personality and self-confidence. </p> <p>Much of my background on Georges's early life and criminal career comes from confidential records made during the mise en examen - the two-year inquiry led by a juge d'instruction , or examining magistrate, at the Palais de Justice - which form the basis of the charges. Of the 30 volumes of documents sent to the public prosecutor, the essence is summed up in a key proc\u00e8s-verbal d'interrogatoire - report on a verbal interrogation- by Judge Gilbert Thiel on May 28, 1998, lasting from 10.10am until 5.55pm, during which Georges confessed to all the killings. The unemotional style of questioning and the detailed recapitulation of previous statements, police evidence, post- mortem and clinical examinations, make the most apparently authentic fictional account of judicial activity in literature and TV seem hollow, invented and strained. </p> <p> Thiel's method comes through as coldly bureaucratic - earlier statements are repeated verbatim over and over again - and the postmortem detail is clinically precise. The last few hours of the murdered women before returning to their studio flats are routinely ordinary - an outing with friends, a drink in a bar, a telephone chat about wedding arrangements or shopping for brand-name clothes. By contrast, the narration of the crimes themselves is visceral and horrifying. Then Thiel patiently digs out the hidden clues to the making of a murderer, a child bureaucratically assassinated and subsequently resurrected under another identity. </p> <p>No public reference has yet been made to the fact that Guy Georges was first registered as Guy Rampillon after his birth to a single mother at Vitry le Fran\u00e7ois, eastern France, on October 10, 1962. His birth certificate as recorded in all pre-trial documents shows, instead, that he was born in the central city of Angers on October 15 of the same year. His father is described as inconnu - unknown - although it is now established that he lived with Guy's mother for some time. </p> <p>The explanation for the little boy's lost identity is both simple and cruel. His mother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, abandoned him to state custody at the age of six because she wanted to marry a US serviceman and emigrate to California, where she lives today. She took with her another son, St\u00e9phane, three years older than his brother and conceived with another American. The difference between the two boys is significant - St\u00e9phane is white and Guy is black, the son of a US air force cook called George Cartwright serving at a French Nato base, who has long since returned to the US. </p> <p>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's own military family - her father was a retired NCO - fostered St\u00e9phane until their daughter emigrated, but refused Guy. It was enough that their estranged daughter had produced one child out of wedlock during a wayward fascination for Americans in uniform, but in her stuffy provincial home town of Angers there was intolerable social stigma attached to a mixed-race birth. After six years' delay, in which Guy was bounced between foster homes and his mother, his status as a ward of the state was finally settled when in the care of a temporary family. The condition of abandonment was the issue of a new birth certificate with false details to prevent him from discovering his origins - a procedure used in similar cases for decades until it was banned in 1996 as a deprivation of basic rights. </p> <p>I have a picture of Guy Georges at six, standing among the many members of his foster family outside a church. His curly hair is abundant and his mouth is set in a sulk. By then he may already have known that he had been chosen by Jeanne Morin, his surrogate mother, because she had previously looked after another black boy whose removal by the authorities made her weep. Guy was a substitute for a lost child. </p> <p> Georges told Thiel that he loved his authoritarian Catholic foster mother, who was decorated for bringing up 12 children in addition to seven of her own. But in pre-adolescence he began to steal from the family food store and, more significantly, acquired a knife to hunt and kill animals in the countryside behind his village home near Angers. By 16, he had attacked two of his foster sisters - neither for sexual reasons - and was packed off to a state orphanage for adolescents. At 17, he was jailed for stealing a woman's handbag after ripping her face open with a knife. Of the next 18 years, before his arrest for serial killing, he spent more than half in jail; every period of release saw a new flurry of sexual attacks. Psychiatrists made no secret about the underlying cause - disaffiliation. </p> <p>\"It is among these subjects of a genealogical death that we most often meet children who transgress laws in a violent and aggressive fashion,\" Grynzspan's team reported, adding that, in Georges's case, \"the real pleasure came from the hunt, the excitement, the wait of a man on his guard\". </p> <p>Among many letters written to a girlfriend after his arrest, Guy Georges refers to his admiration for the tiger. His tidy writing, resembling small, faint print, underlines his fascination for an \"intelligent, powerful, resistant animal, careful and adaptable\"; he claims that he climbed into a tiger's cage as a boy and caressed a tigress \"because it showed no hostility to me\". The psychiatrists were particularly struck by this incident, pointing out that \"hunting in the wild and matters of animal behaviour were constantly present in his conversation, and showed an atavistic identification with domination and predation\". </p> <p>Knowledge of Georges's appalling childhood and the psychiatrists' references to an \"uncontrollable Jekyll and Hyde personality\" that flowed from it might point to extenuating circumstances; however, both medical and psychiatric analysis suggest that he was fully responsible for his self-confessed acts. </p> <p>Within 48 hours of his arrest in 1998, Georges had offered to \"relieve his conscience\" by giving police details of his first murder in 1991. Over the following months, he gave graphic details of the killings of five women in their Paris apartments - four of them around midnight - and of two other women who had been found raped with their throats cut in underground car parks. </p> <p>In describing the first murder - of Pascale Escarfail, a 19-year-old student who had dressed particularly carefully on her last day of life because she had an interview for part-time work in an ice-cream parlour - Georges said that he had been attracted to the young woman with long, blonde hair as she walked past the cafe where he was sitting. He followed her home, forced his way into her apartment at knifepoint, and then bound her hands with sticky tape. \"I must say it was not really a sexual impulse that made me act like that,\" he said. \"I had been with prostitutes just before, and I cannot say what force guided me.\" </p> <p>After raping Escarfail, he looted the flat; he was angered when she gave him a kick, and he then stabbed and suffocated her. The attack took place in 1991 while Georges was on parole for a 10-year sentence for a previous rape at knifepoint. His calm recollections of similar hunts, threats and savage endings are even more terrifying. </p> <p>In October 1999, Thiel, a lawyer of monk-like perseverance and courtesy, summoned all the families of Georges's victims to a courtroom in the Palais de Justice just after he recommended prosecution. Under French criminal law, survivors and relatives claim the status of partie civile, or plaintiff, which allows them access to files and opens the way to compensation. Parties civiles are usually seen as an irritant by examining magistrates, the overall strategists in criminal inquiries, so Thiel's initiative in informing the victims' families of his findings was a rare gesture. </p> <p>The gathering at the Palais de Justice provided one of the most striking instances of the subsidiary ravages of Guy Georges' serial killings. Elisabeth Ortega, a hospital nurse, greeted each arrival with a hug, consoling them as Judge Thiel read from the years of gathered evidence. Ortega had been threatened by Guy Georges carrying \"the sort of knife you use to debone a leg of lamb\", but she had escaped from the ground-floor window of her flat after a lengthy conversation before he could assault her. Unfortunately, her eye-witness description of the incident was so misleading that he remained free long enough to kill three more women. Ortega told police that her attacker was \"of North African type, about 25 years old, athletic build, black shaved hair, about 1m 70, darkish skin, oval face, fine features...\" In fact, Georges's appearance suggests African-European descent. </p> <p>Ortega spent weeks helping the police, but it was hardly surprising that she could find no one among thousands of criminal portraits to resemble Georges. A computer photofit picture using software developed by Scotland Yard confused the search even further by throwing up an image resembling an Asian. As the months dragged on, the North African trail grew stronger after the discovery of a bloodstained footprint that supposedly gave racial clues. </p> <p> Misleading evidence added to sloppy police work, in which rival Police Judiciaire (CID) squads - one trying to solve the murders in the flats and the other working on those in the underground car parks - failed to spot the link between the two series of killings, despite several striking similarities. When the killer was finally identified during a belated hunt through DNA records, neither families nor detectives had the heart to blame Ortega. At the meeting arranged by Judge Thiel, she was in a wheelchair, paralysed from the waist down. I thought this was a sequel to Georges's attack, until she recalled that she had gone on holiday in Greece to forget the ordeal and had broken her back when diving from a rock. </p> <p>Her story is only one account of what military men would call \"collateral damage\". Magali Sirroti's mother, Chantal, for instance, cannot sleep at night. The last recorded message she left on her daughter's telephone on September 23, 1997, the day she died, turns over and over in her head: \"Bonjour, c'est maman. There's no need to call me back, there is nothing important. Gros bisous.\" The telephone had rung unanswered beside the bed where Magali had already bled to death a few minutes earlier. Since then, Chantal Sirotti has read Georges's own description of the killing. </p> <p>Magali Sirotti was killed in the late afternoon on her return from work to the flat where she lived with a garage mechanic. They were planning to get married in the spring, and her wedding dress was in the wardrobe. Magali's parents were a retired working-class couple in the Paris suburbs. Her father, Aldo, spends his days cleaning his daughter's grave or sitting in an armchair absently looking into nowhere. He developed something of a persecution complex, believing that his local town council was trying to drive him mad. After several rows, he found just cause: the theatre near his house had billed a concert. The main work was Schubert's Death And The Maiden. Furious, Aldo Sirotti confronted the mayor and forced him to cover up the posters. </p> <p>Another father slowly drowned himself in drink and died in a suspect car crash. Another refused to console his wife and walked away with all his daughter's personal possessions. Others planned a vigilante group to kill Guy Georges, buying guns and interrupting Thiel's meeting with shouts of \"A mort, \u00e0 mort.\" </p> <p>Anne Gautier, 60, a retired schoolmistress and divorced mother of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Frinking, is the most outspoken critic of police failures in the Guy Georges affair. \"It was not until I alerted the press on coincidences between the murders that there was an outcry,\" she said. \"Journalists invented the description 'The Bastille killer', because two cases were located near the monument and the authorities were forced to accept that a serial killer was loose. Police had told me earlier that tueurs ens\u00e9rie [serial killers] were an Anglo-Saxon thing. I think their stubbornness cost at least two lives. </p> <p>\"I found that the Police Judiciaire didn't even question H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's neighbours until 23 months after she was killed,\" continued Gautier. \"The Elisabeth Ortega identity portrait was drawn up 28 months after she was attacked, but accurate descriptions from other survivors and witnesses [in at least four other cases] were ignored. I was treated patronisingly, like a 'poor little woman', and was told that the links in the Guy Georges's case were missed because police were overworked. They were distracted by the 1995 terrorist bombings, and gave far more importance to the 1997 investigation into Princess Diana's death, when the entire force was mobilised to satisfy public opinion. </p> <p>\"If you challenge the French police,\" she added, \"they are arrogant and claim to be the best in the world, but they had Georges under arrest at least three times for related offences without linking him to the murders, even though he left several clues.\" </p> <p>Other parents have shunned Gautier's attempt to set up a lobby to expose police and administrative failures, which include at least 70 unsolved murders of young women in recent years, accusing her of profiting from her suffering to become a media star. But her lawyers told me that Gautier's apparent toughness was superficial, that she was the most resolute of the mothers in hiding her pain, and that she broke down and wept for days when Georges was finally arrested. </p> <p>Few people concerned by the murders seem to have escaped unscathed. A sense of shame hangs around the Police Judiciaire on the Quai des Orf\u00e8vres. The senior woman superintendent in overall charge of the police inquiry has been transferred to administrative work, and the interior ministry now blocks all requests to speak to her. The two detectives who led the field inquiry admit privately to an unbearable weight of guilt for their failures: one, with a daughter in her 20s, is so depressed that his colleagues believe that the setback will break his career; the other, who worked as a rival rather than a colleague, demanded a transfer to an obscure post in the provinces. </p> <p>Judge Thiel has joined the self-flagellation, although the case would never have been solved if he had not cut through regulations and ordered a search for DNA held in private clinics that finally linked Georges to sexual crimes more than 10 years before. He condemns police bungling in his final report, but finishes by officially blaming himself, as investigator-in-chief, \"for lack of vigilance\". </p> <p>The office of Fran\u00e7ois Honnorat, Georges's first defence counsel, is typical of the profession, a huge, expensively-furnished bureau in a residential quarter remote from the ugliness of violent crime. He spoke in a curiously monotonous, haunted voice, like someone coming to terms with a bewildering experience. A family man in his mid-30s, Honnorat had been chosen by the Paris Bar from 12 stand-by counsels to defend Georges while still representing another multiple killer. </p> <p>\"My first client was terrifying - at one moment calm and attentive, and the next moment extremely violent,\" Honnorat said. \"But Georges is so reasonable and doesn't show any sign of aggression. Talking to him is like chatting to someone in the local cafe. He is extremely well-informed and talks about everything - sport, social questions, politics - in a calm and intelligent way. </p> <p>\"He has been placed in a cell block with big-time criminals, and this has helped him push his own acts out of his mind and inflated his self-esteem. He is at home in prison. He has his television, reads the newspapers and receives visits from his friends in the squats, who give him pocket money. Even the warders like him.\" </p> <p>Georges told psychiatrists that it was \"better I am in prison: outside, I am dangerous\"; he has been diagnosed as \"hyper-adaptable\", colouring himself to his environment in the same way as he adapted his personality to night-prowling, arbitrating in squats, living rough and seducing any number of women. Honnorat found his behaviour so disconcerting that he was glad when he received a short, well-written letter from Guy Georges dismissing him as a lawyer. </p> <p>The decision is linked to the fact that Georges's cell neighbour is Carlos \"The Jackal\", the international terrorist whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez. Carlos, a Venezuelan, became notorious in the 70s for actions on behalf of the Palestinians, notably the kidnap of the Opec oil ministers in Vienna in 1975. He was arrested in 1994 and is currently serving a life sentence for the murders of two French policemen. His family is campaigning to have him released on the grounds that his imprisonment in France is illegal, and Carlos himself went on a hunger strike in 1998 in protest at ill-treatment by prison guards. Since then, in La Sant\u00e9, Carlos has continued his incessant attack on the corruption of western society, and has persuaded Georges to take a more aggressive stance against the French state, as a personal revenge for all wrongs done to him. To this end, Georges has taken on another barrister with a reputation for turning hearings into show trials. </p> <p>\"I don't see why I should be the only one to pay for this,\" Georges told Honnorat in his last letter, referring to appalling laxity in the French prison system that diagnosed him as \"extremely dangerous\" nearly 20 years ago and yet released him on to the streets without treatment, money or meaningful care. At the basis of this feeling of persecution lies Georges's resentment for a birthright that was stolen by officialdom, which obstructed all his attempts to find his father at times of great stress. </p> <p>\"When he was finally told his father's name, it was as if he had been reborn,\" Honnorat said. \"He leaped with joy. He had retrieved the identity that he had been running after all his life. Being American raised his self-importance and self-confidence. Before he heard the news, he was ready to admit his crimes at the assizes to save the families further anguish. Now, he wants to take on the whole system.\" </p> <p> Since meeting Carlos, Georges has invented a bizarre defence, claiming that he was framed by the French secret service because he supposedly stole an official limousine carrying confidential documents. Recent letters to his friends say that he will plead not guilty in what may be an attempt to impress his long-lost father. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, this will only antagonise the jury,\" Honnorat said. \"He has no hope of escaping a lifetime in prison after confessing his crimes repeatedly to police and Judge Thiel in the presence of his own defence counsel.\" But the lawyer was clearly torn in his own judgment on the appropriate punishment for the criminal journey of a lost child whom society had treated as trash. \"I asked the psychiatrists if they could find a solution to save him from perpetual confinement,\" Honnorat said. \"Their answer was clear: Georges was not mad and was fully responsible for his acts. They said that there were two roads for a man of his type. He was pre-destined to become a murderer or a war hero.\" </p> <p>In a flash of black humour, the psychiatrists added: \"And we have no intention of starting a world war to save Guy Georges.\"</p>",

Even after his arrest, the press referred to his origins as French West Indian and his father's real identity was not revealed until two years of interrogation ended - a disclosure that had a profound effect on Georges's personality and self-confidence. Much of my background on Georges's early life and criminal career comes from confidential records made during the mise en examen - the two-year inquiry led by a juge d'instruction , or examining magistrate, at the Palais de Justice - which form the basis of the charges. Of the 30 volumes of documents sent to the public prosecutor, the essence is summed up in a key proc\u00e8s-verbal d'interrogatoire - report on a verbal interrogation- by Judge Gilbert Thiel on May 28, 1998, lasting from 10.10am until 5.55pm, during which Georges confessed to all the killings. The unemotional style of questioning and the detailed recapitulation of previous statements, police evidence, post- mortem and clinical examinations, make the most apparently authentic fictional account of judicial activity in literature and TV seem hollow, invented and strained. Thiel's method comes through as coldly bureaucratic - earlier statements are repeated verbatim over and over again - and the postmortem detail is clinically precise. The last few hours of the murdered women before returning to their studio flats are routinely ordinary - an outing with friends, a drink in a bar, a telephone chat about wedding arrangements or shopping for brand-name clothes. By contrast, the narration of the crimes themselves is visceral and horrifying. Then Thiel patiently digs out the hidden clues to the making of a murderer, a child bureaucratically assassinated and subsequently resurrected under another identity. No public reference has yet been made to the fact that Guy Georges was first registered as Guy Rampillon after his birth to a single mother at Vitry le Fran\u00e7ois, eastern France, on October 10, 1962. His birth certificate as recorded in all pre-trial documents shows, instead, that he was born in the central city of Angers on October 15 of the same year. His father is described as inconnu - unknown - although it is now established that he lived with Guy's mother for some time. The explanation for the little boy's lost identity is both simple and cruel. His mother, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, abandoned him to state custody at the age of six because she wanted to marry a US serviceman and emigrate to California, where she lives today. She took with her another son, St\u00e9phane, three years older than his brother and conceived with another American. The difference between the two boys is significant - St\u00e9phane is white and Guy is black, the son of a US air force cook called George Cartwright serving at a French Nato base, who has long since returned to the US. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's own military family - her father was a retired NCO - fostered St\u00e9phane until their daughter emigrated, but refused Guy. It was enough that their estranged daughter had produced one child out of wedlock during a wayward fascination for Americans in uniform, but in her stuffy provincial home town of Angers there was intolerable social stigma attached to a mixed-race birth. After six years' delay, in which Guy was bounced between foster homes and his mother, his status as a ward of the state was finally settled when in the care of a temporary family. The condition of abandonment was the issue of a new birth certificate with false details to prevent him from discovering his origins - a procedure used in similar cases for decades until it was banned in 1996 as a deprivation of basic rights. I have a picture of Guy Georges at six, standing among the many members of his foster family outside a church. His curly hair is abundant and his mouth is set in a sulk. By then he may already have known that he had been chosen by Jeanne Morin, his surrogate mother, because she had previously looked after another black boy whose removal by the authorities made her weep. Guy was a substitute for a lost child. Georges told Thiel that he loved his authoritarian Catholic foster mother, who was decorated for bringing up 12 children in addition to seven of her own. But in pre-adolescence he began to steal from the family food store and, more significantly, acquired a knife to hunt and kill animals in the countryside behind his village home near Angers. By 16, he had attacked two of his foster sisters - neither for sexual reasons - and was packed off to a state orphanage for adolescents. At 17, he was jailed for stealing a woman's handbag after ripping her face open with a knife. Of the next 18 years, before his arrest for serial killing, he spent more than half in jail; every period of release saw a new flurry of sexual attacks. Psychiatrists made no secret about the underlying cause - disaffiliation. \"It is among these subjects of a genealogical death that we most often meet children who transgress laws in a violent and aggressive fashion,\" Grynzspan's team reported, adding that, in Georges's case, \"the real pleasure came from the hunt, the excitement, the wait of a man on his guard\". Among many letters written to a girlfriend after his arrest, Guy Georges refers to his admiration for the tiger. His tidy writing, resembling small, faint print, underlines his fascination for an \"intelligent, powerful, resistant animal, careful and adaptable\"; he claims that he climbed into a tiger's cage as a boy and caressed a tigress \"because it showed no hostility to me\". The psychiatrists were particularly struck by this incident, pointing out that \"hunting in the wild and matters of animal behaviour were constantly present in his conversation, and showed an atavistic identification with domination and predation\". Knowledge of Georges's appalling childhood and the psychiatrists' references to an \"uncontrollable Jekyll and Hyde personality\" that flowed from it might point to extenuating circumstances; however, both medical and psychiatric analysis suggest that he was fully responsible for his self-confessed acts. Within 48 hours of his arrest in 1998, Georges had offered to \"relieve his conscience\" by giving police details of his first murder in 1991. Over the following months, he gave graphic details of the killings of five women in their Paris apartments - four of them around midnight - and of two other women who had been found raped with their throats cut in underground car parks. In describing the first murder - of Pascale Escarfail, a 19-year-old student who had dressed particularly carefully on her last day of life because she had an interview for part-time work in an ice-cream parlour - Georges said that he had been attracted to the young woman with long, blonde hair as she walked past the cafe where he was sitting. He followed her home, forced his way into her apartment at knifepoint, and then bound her hands with sticky tape. \"I must say it was not really a sexual impulse that made me act like that,\" he said. \"I had been with prostitutes just before, and I cannot say what force guided me.\" After raping Escarfail, he looted the flat; he was angered when she gave him a kick, and he then stabbed and suffocated her. The attack took place in 1991 while Georges was on parole for a 10-year sentence for a previous rape at knifepoint. His calm recollections of similar hunts, threats and savage endings are even more terrifying. In October 1999, Thiel, a lawyer of monk-like perseverance and courtesy, summoned all the families of Georges's victims to a courtroom in the Palais de Justice just after he recommended prosecution. Under French criminal law, survivors and relatives claim the status of partie civile, or plaintiff, which allows them access to files and opens the way to compensation. Parties civiles are usually seen as an irritant by examining magistrates, the overall strategists in criminal inquiries, so Thiel's initiative in informing the victims' families of his findings was a rare gesture. The gathering at the Palais de Justice provided one of the most striking instances of the subsidiary ravages of Guy Georges' serial killings. Elisabeth Ortega, a hospital nurse, greeted each arrival with a hug, consoling them as Judge Thiel read from the years of gathered evidence. Ortega had been threatened by Guy Georges carrying \"the sort of knife you use to debone a leg of lamb\", but she had escaped from the ground-floor window of her flat after a lengthy conversation before he could assault her. Unfortunately, her eye-witness description of the incident was so misleading that he remained free long enough to kill three more women. Ortega told police that her attacker was \"of North African type, about 25 years old, athletic build, black shaved hair, about 1m 70, darkish skin, oval face, fine features...\" In fact, Georges's appearance suggests African-European descent. Ortega spent weeks helping the police, but it was hardly surprising that she could find no one among thousands of criminal portraits to resemble Georges. A computer photofit picture using software developed by Scotland Yard confused the search even further by throwing up an image resembling an Asian. As the months dragged on, the North African trail grew stronger after the discovery of a bloodstained footprint that supposedly gave racial clues. Misleading evidence added to sloppy police work, in which rival Police Judiciaire (CID) squads - one trying to solve the murders in the flats and the other working on those in the underground car parks - failed to spot the link between the two series of killings, despite several striking similarities. When the killer was finally identified during a belated hunt through DNA records, neither families nor detectives had the heart to blame Ortega. At the meeting arranged by Judge Thiel, she was in a wheelchair, paralysed from the waist down. I thought this was a sequel to Georges's attack, until she recalled that she had gone on holiday in Greece to forget the ordeal and had broken her back when diving from a rock. Her story is only one account of what military men would call \"collateral damage\". Magali Sirroti's mother, Chantal, for instance, cannot sleep at night. The last recorded message she left on her daughter's telephone on September 23, 1997, the day she died, turns over and over in her head: \"Bonjour, c'est maman. There's no need to call me back, there is nothing important. Gros bisous.\" The telephone had rung unanswered beside the bed where Magali had already bled to death a few minutes earlier. Since then, Chantal Sirotti has read Georges's own description of the killing. Magali Sirotti was killed in the late afternoon on her return from work to the flat where she lived with a garage mechanic. They were planning to get married in the spring, and her wedding dress was in the wardrobe. Magali's parents were a retired working-class couple in the Paris suburbs. Her father, Aldo, spends his days cleaning his daughter's grave or sitting in an armchair absently looking into nowhere. He developed something of a persecution complex, believing that his local town council was trying to drive him mad. After several rows, he found just cause: the theatre near his house had billed a concert. The main work was Schubert's Death And The Maiden. Furious, Aldo Sirotti confronted the mayor and forced him to cover up the posters. Another father slowly drowned himself in drink and died in a suspect car crash. Another refused to console his wife and walked away with all his daughter's personal possessions. Others planned a vigilante group to kill Guy Georges, buying guns and interrupting Thiel's meeting with shouts of \"A mort, \u00e0 mort.\" Anne Gautier, 60, a retired schoolmistress and divorced mother of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Frinking, is the most outspoken critic of police failures in the Guy Georges affair. \"It was not until I alerted the press on coincidences between the murders that there was an outcry,\" she said. \"Journalists invented the description 'The Bastille killer', because two cases were located near the monument and the authorities were forced to accept that a serial killer was loose. Police had told me earlier that tueurs ens\u00e9rie [serial killers] were an Anglo-Saxon thing. I think their stubbornness cost at least two lives. \"I found that the Police Judiciaire didn't even question H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's neighbours until 23 months after she was killed,\" continued Gautier. \"The Elisabeth Ortega identity portrait was drawn up 28 months after she was attacked, but accurate descriptions from other survivors and witnesses [in at least four other cases] were ignored. I was treated patronisingly, like a 'poor little woman', and was told that the links in the Guy Georges's case were missed because police were overworked. They were distracted by the 1995 terrorist bombings, and gave far more importance to the 1997 investigation into Princess Diana's death, when the entire force was mobilised to satisfy public opinion. \"If you challenge the French police,\" she added, \"they are arrogant and claim to be the best in the world, but they had Georges under arrest at least three times for related offences without linking him to the murders, even though he left several clues.\" Other parents have shunned Gautier's attempt to set up a lobby to expose police and administrative failures, which include at least 70 unsolved murders of young women in recent years, accusing her of profiting from her suffering to become a media star. But her lawyers told me that Gautier's apparent toughness was superficial, that she was the most resolute of the mothers in hiding her pain, and that she broke down and wept for days when Georges was finally arrested. Few people concerned by the murders seem to have escaped unscathed. A sense of shame hangs around the Police Judiciaire on the Quai des Orf\u00e8vres. The senior woman superintendent in overall charge of the police inquiry has been transferred to administrative work, and the interior ministry now blocks all requests to speak to her. The two detectives who led the field inquiry admit privately to an unbearable weight of guilt for their failures: one, with a daughter in her 20s, is so depressed that his colleagues believe that the setback will break his career; the other, who worked as a rival rather than a colleague, demanded a transfer to an obscure post in the provinces. Judge Thiel has joined the self-flagellation, although the case would never have been solved if he had not cut through regulations and ordered a search for DNA held in private clinics that finally linked Georges to sexual crimes more than 10 years before. He condemns police bungling in his final report, but finishes by officially blaming himself, as investigator-in-chief, \"for lack of vigilance\". The office of Fran\u00e7ois Honnorat, Georges's first defence counsel, is typical of the profession, a huge, expensively-furnished bureau in a residential quarter remote from the ugliness of violent crime. He spoke in a curiously monotonous, haunted voice, like someone coming to terms with a bewildering experience. A family man in his mid-30s, Honnorat had been chosen by the Paris Bar from 12 stand-by counsels to defend Georges while still representing another multiple killer. \"My first client was terrifying - at one moment calm and attentive, and the next moment extremely violent,\" Honnorat said. \"But Georges is so reasonable and doesn't show any sign of aggression. Talking to him is like chatting to someone in the local cafe. He is extremely well-informed and talks about everything - sport, social questions, politics - in a calm and intelligent way. \"He has been placed in a cell block with big-time criminals, and this has helped him push his own acts out of his mind and inflated his self-esteem. He is at home in prison. He has his television, reads the newspapers and receives visits from his friends in the squats, who give him pocket money. Even the warders like him.\" Georges told psychiatrists that it was \"better I am in prison: outside, I am dangerous\"; he has been diagnosed as \"hyper-adaptable\", colouring himself to his environment in the same way as he adapted his personality to night-prowling, arbitrating in squats, living rough and seducing any number of women. Honnorat found his behaviour so disconcerting that he was glad when he received a short, well-written letter from Guy Georges dismissing him as a lawyer. The decision is linked to the fact that Georges's cell neighbour is Carlos \"The Jackal\", the international terrorist whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez. Carlos, a Venezuelan, became notorious in the 70s for actions on behalf of the Palestinians, notably the kidnap of the Opec oil ministers in Vienna in 1975. He was arrested in 1994 and is currently serving a life sentence for the murders of two French policemen. His family is campaigning to have him released on the grounds that his imprisonment in France is illegal, and Carlos himself went on a hunger strike in 1998 in protest at ill-treatment by prison guards. Since then, in La Sant\u00e9, Carlos has continued his incessant attack on the corruption of western society, and has persuaded Georges to take a more aggressive stance against the French state, as a personal revenge for all wrongs done to him. To this end, Georges has taken on another barrister with a reputation for turning hearings into show trials. \"I don't see why I should be the only one to pay for this,\" Georges told Honnorat in his last letter, referring to appalling laxity in the French prison system that diagnosed him as \"extremely dangerous\" nearly 20 years ago and yet released him on to the streets without treatment, money or meaningful care. At the basis of this feeling of persecution lies Georges's resentment for a birthright that was stolen by officialdom, which obstructed all his attempts to find his father at times of great stress. \"When he was finally told his father's name, it was as if he had been reborn,\" Honnorat said. \"He leaped with joy. He had retrieved the identity that he had been running after all his life. Being American raised his self-importance and self-confidence. Before he heard the news, he was ready to admit his crimes at the assizes to save the families further anguish. Now, he wants to take on the whole system.\" Since meeting Carlos, Georges has invented a bizarre defence, claiming that he was framed by the French secret service because he supposedly stole an official limousine carrying confidential documents. Recent letters to his friends say that he will plead not guilty in what may be an attempt to impress his long-lost father. \"Unfortunately, this will only antagonise the jury,\" Honnorat said. \"He has no hope of escaping a lifetime in prison after confessing his crimes repeatedly to police and Judge Thiel in the presence of his own defence counsel.\" But the lawyer was clearly torn in his own judgment on the appropriate punishment for the criminal journey of a lost child whom society had treated as trash. \"I asked the psychiatrists if they could find a solution to save him from perpetual confinement,\" Honnorat said. \"Their answer was clear: Georges was not mad and was fully responsible for his acts. They said that there were two roads for a man of his type. He was pre-destined to become a murderer or a war hero.\" In a flash of black humour, the psychiatrists added: \"And we have no intention of starting a world war to save Guy Georges.\"",

      "body": "<p>If Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts represent the norm of what a Hollywood film star should look like - \"fashioned\" faces - then Christina Ricci is definitely abnormal. She is not tall, five foot one, her legs are short, and though her face is fresh and round as an apple, the forehead is broad and high and the eyes that look out from under it fix you with a deadpan take-it-or-leave-it stare. She resembles, shockingly, the sort of people that you stand next to in a bus queue. And, indeed, the day before meeting her I had stood beside her at a video store on Sunset Boulevard, as king for some of her films, without recognising her. It was only after she left that a slightly embarrassed guy at the counter informed me: \"That, er, was Miss Ricci.\" (Incidentally, the films she rented were Dick and Felicia's Journey - both featuring actresses of a similar age to herself - 20. Homework for the conscientious.) </p> <p>She arrives at my hotel bang on time - unusual to the point of deviant in Hollywood - wearing jeans, a sweater that she may have on inside out, extremely high shoes and no make-up. And immediately apologises for her appearance. The previous day, watching her shoot an upcoming film, Pumpkin, in which she plays a varsity cheerleader, she had looked pert and prim. \"Today,\" she says, \"I am sorry, you've just got me.\" And if I hadn't admired her already, consider her, in fact, not just the cliche \"finest actress of her generation\" but someone who within movie-making has pretty much invented her own style - this is the point at which I would have succumbed. The particular qualities she has are not hard to pin down - just unbelievably hard to act. A sense she gives that we are spying on unrehearsed reality. And, even more unusual this - as an actor she never asks for, or expects, our sympathy; she keeps us at arm's length, the comfortable distance. </p> <p>She is currently appearing alongside her pal Johnny Depp in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, but it is for her role in The Addams Family, playing the stone-faced, psychotic Wednesday with a bewitching insouciance, that many of us came to admire her. But, as she says, when she made The Addams Family she was 10. \"I did what I was told. Express no emotion. That is the only direction I received throughout the entire film.\" Then, in the late 90s, now in her teens, came the cluster of roles on which she is rightly judged - each of them a study in some kind of deviant adolescent survival technique, playing characters whose sense of their own \"normality\" is at variance with the norm. The classic adolescent, in other words. She was riveting as the 14-year-old Wendy in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm (1997), and not even Lee's first choice for the part. That honour went to Natalie Portman - but when Portman's parents turned the role down, \"unsuitable\" for their daughter, Lee cast Ricci. </p> <p>He must have blessed the gods. No one else could have conveyed with such dispassion that fusion of amorality and innocence, the creative self-sufficiency of the young, as Wendy observes her parents' sexual antics with mixed tremors of pity and disgust. And never evincing surprise. Surprise is the one state you will never find in Miss Ricci. Just a shrug of resignation. Sure, rejection hurts she says - \"that they wanted someone else instead of you\". </p> <p>Two more versions of adolescent alienation followed. She was hysterically funny, and again insouciant, as the hard-boiled Dedee Truit in Don Roos's The Opposite Of Sex, pregnant and packing her gun, paying not so much as lip-service to conventional values and not caring what anyone thinks. And then, her best role, Layla in Vincent Gallo's Buffalo '66. The part seems made for her, and certainly Gallo, who wrote, directed and acts in what is virtually a two-hander, must have thought so. </p> <p>As Layla, naive, open-hearted, a kid abducted from her dance class by the bruised and crazed Gallo, who then falls in love with him, she is wanly haunting. She moves through the film like some phantom, untethered to reality, registering petulance where someone else would register terror, shrugging where others would weep, pulling down at the hem of her baby-doll dress. \"That was me, I didn't want anyone to see my underwear.\" In the bright-eyed candour of her face a mute appeal - but to what? She was brilliant. </p> <p>And how did Gallo repay her? He slagged her off in the press, \"I don't like her.\" Mocked her weight, mocked her work. Called her \"a puppet\" and \"an ungrateful cunt\", when the gratitude should have been all his. \"That's just Vincent,\" she says. \"Always lashing out, always trashing someone. Yeah, I'd work with him again. He's very talented.\" Pain and pragmatism. Not as divorced as sometimes they seem. </p> <p>She made lots of mistakes around this time, Ricci says - as how could she not? She gave interviews in which she said ridiculous things, things to shock. There was something about incest being \"normal\" - that word again. Something about a gun. Comments about the benefits of cruelly intensive diets. As though she were some character out of The Addams Family writ large, turning the world system upside down - which, in a sense, she was. \"I thought I was being funny.\" She was 18. \"I was called Goth. People made me sound weird. I think most people thought I was a freak. Someone dark, different... I know I am not average. But I am not dark. I am not even that odd.\" She thought she was being normal, playing out the normal disaffected kid. </p> <p> Anyone could see her life had not been normal. Out of family life at the age of 10, working in an environment -the movies - wholly removed from reality. But, within that world, fashioning versions of her own adolescent isolation seemed normal to her - it is what adolescents do. Adolescents are soloists - they have this in common with artists - and, if they identify at all, it is with other misfits - viz Ricci's roles. It is this that gives adolescents their pathos and their quality of the appalling. Lee understood this well in The Ice Storm. While the adults are enacting cliches of aberrant behaviour - adultery, partner-swapping at key parties, vodka in the afternoon - it is the kids who are truly subversive. And we fear them, rightly, as the film shows. What the adults in The Ice Storm take for unhappiness is merely what is normal. Normal unhappiness. Until the end, and their discovery of grief. (You suspect also that the kids will be better equipped to deal with grief - yet another reason for fearing them. As Ricci says, \"Children adapt the quickest.\") </p> <p>Ricci's background was normal, that is to say unhappy. Her dad was 56 when she was born - the last of four. It was his third marriage. And when asked if there were children by the previous marriages, Ricci replies, \"Not that we are aware of\" - the only time she gives a glib response. So begins the dispassion, questions you don't ask because you don't want to know the answer. </p> <p>Her mum, she says, was a good mum, but busy, \"Four kids\" and so she was \"mothered\" mostly by her sister Pia, four years older and now a teacher in Chicago. Pia was the good one, the one who never got into trouble. Christina was, of necessity, naughty. The kind of bright but obstreperous child teachers slap down knowing full well they'll bounce right up again. \"I think I knew from a very early age that there was nothing they could do to me. They couldn't put me in jail, so I could do what I wanted.\" </p> <p>Ricci's background was also abnormal. Though, for the most part, she didn't perceive it as such. Her dad was a therapist, specialising in primal scream therapy, based in the basement of their home in New Jersey, and the kids would come home from school to all this wailing and bawling inarticulacy rising up through the floorboards. And ignore it. \"It didn't have any impact on us at all. None of us took the slightest bit of notice. It wasn't a big deal.\" </p> <p>Children, as she has said, are quick to adapt. \"We were all very self-contained little entities who happened to live in the same house.\" As little entities they adapted, too, to his ideas of discipline. \"By the age of 10, we'd have to do our own laundry. Bed time was adjusted upwards by half-an-hour every other year until the age of 17, when there was no longer a curfew.\" (In an interview she once gave, she talked of the pleasure of being 17: \"No more curfew.\" By this time, she had been working for seven years, and was then living in her own flat with her boyfriend. Not that quick to adapt after all.) Family supper was at 5.30pm sharp. \"It was very strict, we all had to be there.\" And their father would regale them with his life's philosophy. He was, she says, \"a very paranoid man\" who taught them there is no such thing as selflessness, no one ever really likes you, people are only out for themselves - inversions of basic human values masquerading as survival. That makes The Addams Family look, well, normal. At least they shared human attributes of love and trust. </p> <p> What did her father think he was doing? \"I think he thought that because he was like that, so was everybody else. He was passing on his little secret to his children.\" She didn't believe him. \"I don't think it affected me because I decided it wasn't true. No way. Life couldn't be that way.\" But, like the curfew, these things are not so easily dispelled. To this day, she says, when hurt she makes very bad recoveries, but she's got a strategy for coping. \"On the whole, I don't give people a second chance. They don't get to hurt me again.\" </p> <p>When confronted she prefers to capitulate. \"I'd do anything to avoid a fight.\" If challenged, \"I apologise.\" Afraid, I guess, that if pushed to the line her father's miserable little secret just might prove to be true. People don't like you. It's no surprise that she repeats so painstakingly Gallo's remarks about her. They must have had a horrible ring of familiarity. And what did she do - just shrugged and let him get away with it. </p> <p>She didn't let her father get away with it. She was 13 when her parents divorced and he left home. She had just finished filming the sequel to The Addams Family. For the next two years she saw him on and off, but since she was 15 they have had no contact at all. \"And I don't expect to have again. I know it sounds cold, but it was one of the first things I ever did in my life - to take care of myself. Decide that only people who deserve it can be in my life.\" She loved her mum. \"But I was awful with her, frightening. I just did whatever I wanted. Didn't come home if I didn't feel like it. Refused any sort of protection.\" She had become her own protector. </p> <p>One of the great benefits of getting older, she says, is that you get to create another family for yourself. Film became her family. Quite literally. You can see how it would work. An enclosed, safe little world. \"People who are kind to me.\" With \"regular hours\" - that would resonate. The crew are her brothers, looking after her. \"They carry me around.\" The director is the authority figure. She does what she is told. \"And I resent it.\" Naturally. Her mother always there with her - so she finally had the attention she must have been clamouring for. </p> <p>She has often said that she is not interested in her characters' emotions. Doesn't question their motivation. \"It seems very pretentious to me to talk about non-existent human feelings.\" She is not interested in inner reality. \"I try to play the reality.\" It is something she learned as a child actor. \"No one talks to you about emotions then. It is how I was trained. A technique I learned and have carried through.\" Funny how one world blends into another. You could almost think that she is talking here about what she learned in her childhood. </p> <p>And the even funnier thing is, she says, that the moment she started acting, all the bad behaviour stopped. As if swapping \"normal\" family life for the abnormal world of Hollywood normalised her, saved her from becoming like the lonely, lost dysfunctional characters she plays. Finally, she had a peer group - not a very normal one for the adolescent, true - but a group of people engaged in the same thing. And, in this sort of weird version of the world, she finds suddenly she fits. So she can't be cynical about Hollywood, she says. It may be a fantasy. \"All the glamour, the limos, the beautiful hotels.\" It's certainly not a reality. \"That's not how you live your life, that only happens from time to time.\" But we are all implicated in it, she says. Fantasy is our escape. </p> <p> All the time throughout the late 90s, when she was presenting herself as so tough, so cynical, she would go home to her apartment and there, under the bed, would be her scrapbook, in which she would paste pictures of her idealised life. \"Just the dreams that all little girls have. How I wanted my house to look. The dresses I'd wear. The car I wanted. That kind of stuff. I suppose it's funny, really.\" She'd cut out of Martha Stewart's bridal magazines photographs of the perfect wedding she would have, right down to the flowers and table settings. \"I liked to think I'd be engaged at 18, married at 20, have kids at 23. A perfect concept.\" But a bit of a constricted concept, because the problem was that it stopped at about 27. \"That's as far as it goes. The tragic accident in which you and your husband never get old and live together forever and ever.\" </p> <p>In her heart, she says, she never believed any of it. Neither the fantasy of the Goth, nor the fantasy of the little princess. She just wanted to get to play that part - for once. \"You know, be a fairy, be luminescent, sparkle. I'm sorry.\" She was trying to resist, she says, the idea that \"unhappiness is normal\". Because it seemed to her pragmatic, or plain good sense, to assume the worst. \"That something bad was going to happen. That happy people just aren't looking around them. They don't realise it is going to be their turn next.\" And then the realisation, and not necessarily a comfortable one - that most people are unhappy because their lives don't measure up to some fantasy of happiness that they have. That if you can accept unhappiness as part of life - then you may be well on the way to being happy. </p> <p>You make your own world, she says - to a large extent but not the whole extent. You can't be held responsible for everything. And then, what seemed a non-sequitur, but isn't, she said, \"Women have been taught shame about themselves over centuries.\" And, of course, it is obvious. That she has had to overcome all those insecurities of the adolescent girl, in public and on her own. \"Because it is me up there. And it's a pretty isolated position. That's why, now, I accept any help that's on offer. I love people doing things for me. It makes me feel less vulnerable and exposed. That even if it's me up there, there are people around me who care about me.\" </p> <p>She was seriously anorexic for a while, hated what she looked like - and that gave her a shock. She still chain smokes. \"But I don't feel inferior to men any more, and I don't feel ashamed of being a woman. Certainly I did. I think that's why teenage girls are so angry. You reach puberty and your first reaction is embarrassment. And then rage about the embarrassment. And you feel so foolish because it's not your fault. And, anyway, why be embarrassed?\" </p> <p>The film she has just completed, Prozac Nation, deals with issues in this area of self-abuse. It was a comparatively short shoot, but when it was over she was physically and mentally exhausted. \"My doctor asked me, 'Why would you jeopardise your mental state in this way?'\" I can handle anything, she told him. I am emotionally impervious. There hasn't been anything I haven't been able to get over... And, somewhere here, the sense that suffering is normal while being also unbearable. As she says, the key to understanding other people is empathy. Imagining yourself in another's place. \"It seems to me that this story is like every girl's fear of what and who they really are. A complete and total wreck.\" So making it, she says, was also a form of self-protection. \"Because if you can understand why something has happened, why someone has done something, then you are less likely to be hurt.\" </p> <p>Work has become her stability. \"Every aspect of this business seems normal to me at this point.\" Over a period of 10 years, she has been in 29 films, 16 of these in the past four years. She loves it. Has grown up with it. But, unlike the adolescent turned young adult who leaves home, she is going to have to grow old with it. What she has to work out is how to develop within it and - Hollywood having its own strict set of norms - how not to get herself stuck. </p> <p>She says she doesn't have many friends, but she does have good friends - professional and personal. Johnny Depp has been a mate over the past few years. Not in any romantic sense - she laughs at this as an absurd notion. It was Depp who got her involved in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, where she finally gets to play a romantic lead who looks like a princess. Though, in fact, as she points out, there is a dark side. \"That's why they cast me. To throw a little suspicion on the character.\" </p> <p>Originally, the studios didn't want her, not because of her work, but because of her image - as a bit of a loose cannon - not always judicious in her choice of words. So she has learned to be more careful now, she says. A bit more \"grown up\". She used to make mistakes out of \"arrogance and insecurity - two sides of the same thing\". But, as she says, both inevitable. From an early age - she puts it as young as eight - she was \"controlling\" her life. What possible result but arrogance and insecurity? </p> <p>When she says she is arrogant, she is not arrogant about her work. And she is generous. On the set of Pumpkin, I met her friend and assistant, Dave, an aspiring cinematographer, whom she met filming in New York and who couldn't get a way in to LA. So she brought him out, gave him a job, with a good salary, and a room. And, as he says, the time to look around and get known. \"A lot of people helped me,\" Ricci says. \"I think it's normal.\" It is normal - except a lot of people don't remember to behave as well. </p> <p>She is the same about other young actors. I watched her on the set being thanked, swamped with ingratiation, by women more than five years older than her. It is the star system and she is used to it, but it's still salutary. \"There are a lot of good people out there who never get the chance. I see so many amazing actors who never make it and for so many different reasons. If you are a woman, you have to have the whole package. It's one thing to be a great actor - but if you are not pretty, or if there is no angle - forget it. It's not good enough to be a good actor.\" </p> <p>And, as far as insecurity goes, she is now on her own. Her three-year relationship, to the actor Matthew Frauman, ended five months ago, not bitterly. \"Nothing dramatic happened. It was simply over. Sometimes things just end, and it's really sad. I think it may even be the saddest thing.\" And, though she would love to fall in love again, \"I don't like dating, so I am just stumbling through. And I don't like being alone, but I can't go looking to fall in love.\" Maybe, she says, if she were more graceful. \"I'd love to be graceful. More confident, more at ease with myself. Instead of falling into saying silly things, even nasty things, because I am embarrassed.\" </p> <p>Just the other night, she says, at a charity view, she was watching Minnie Driver, singing for the first time with her band. And Minnie saying to her audience that she wasn't confident, and please excuse her. \"But she did it with such grace... I want to have that grace.\" And you feel like throwing your arms around her - or throwing them up in despair. And saying: 'Please, not Minnie Driver. Please see yourself more clearly.' But you can't, you have to bite your lip. Because she is 20 and not a child and beyond the age where she can be told things that she can rely on. And she can't fall back any longer on being silly and not caring much if she is silly. \"I think,\" she says, \"I'll be more confident when I am older.\" </p> <p> Somewhere down the line, her performance in The Man Who Cried will be described as \"transitional\" in Ricci's work. It is not a great film, but it is a good film and it elicits from a fantastic group of actors - Cate Blanchett, Johnny Depp, John Turturro and Ricci - virtuoso performances. This may even be its problem. High-wire artists - performing without a safety net - it can come over as melodrama, though its intent could not be more serious. It is set mostly during the war in occupied Paris. Depp is a Gypsy, an endangered species. Blanchett, a voluptuary. It won't save her. Turturro is an artist, an opera singer, and a fascist. No immediate fear for him, except for his soul. Between them Ricci is their coherence - subtle, often silent - nothing languid, nothing blas\u00e9 about her. Hers is a cool directed curiosity. As the director, Sally Potter has brought out in Ricci something we see now was always there - a contagious honesty. </p> <p>When she was little, Ricci says, she used to think fate was like being pulled along by something rather sadistic. \"Not that fate is sadistic, but I think it is bored - as bored as I am.\" So entertainment became something you did to stop the gods being bored and turning their darts upon you. But as you get older, less powerless, you can take on the attributes of the \"sadistic\"or \"bored\" fates or gods. It would be a perfectly understandable revenge - if not a creditable one. Not her, Ricci says. Sadism is like promiscuity, it just goes where it wants. What about cool? That's easy. Just glare frostily and talk in short sentences. \"Not very interesting,\" she says. \"I have never been much good at social disguise.\" </p> <p>I took her down to her car, a brand new Porsche Boxster. \"You won't judge me on my car, will you?\" she said. No, I said. </p> <p>\u0095 The Man Who Cried opens on December 8.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts represent the norm of what a Hollywood film star should look like - \"fashioned\" faces - then Christina Ricci is definitely abnormal. She is not tall, five foot one, her legs are short, and though her face is fresh and round as an apple, the forehead is broad and high and the eyes that look out from under it fix you with a deadpan take-it-or-leave-it stare. She resembles, shockingly, the sort of people that you stand next to in a bus queue. And, indeed, the day before meeting her I had stood beside her at a video store on Sunset Boulevard, as king for some of her films, without recognising her. It was only after she left that a slightly embarrassed guy at the counter informed me: \"That, er, was Miss Ricci.\" (Incidentally, the films she rented were Dick and Felicia's Journey - both featuring actresses of a similar age to herself - 20. Homework for the conscientious.) She arrives at my hotel bang on time - unusual to the point of deviant in Hollywood - wearing jeans, a sweater that she may have on inside out, extremely high shoes and no make-up. And immediately apologises for her appearance. The previous day, watching her shoot an upcoming film, Pumpkin, in which she plays a varsity cheerleader, she had looked pert and prim. \"Today,\" she says, \"I am sorry, you've just got me.\" And if I hadn't admired her already, consider her, in fact, not just the cliche \"finest actress of her generation\" but someone who within movie-making has pretty much invented her own style - this is the point at which I would have succumbed. The particular qualities she has are not hard to pin down - just unbelievably hard to act. A sense she gives that we are spying on unrehearsed reality. And, even more unusual this - as an actor she never asks for, or expects, our sympathy; she keeps us at arm's length, the comfortable distance. She is currently appearing alongside her pal Johnny Depp in Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried, but it is for her role in The Addams Family, playing the stone-faced, psychotic Wednesday with a bewitching insouciance, that many of us came to admire her. But, as she says, when she made The Addams Family she was 10. \"I did what I was told. Express no emotion. That is the only direction I received throughout the entire film.\" Then, in the late 90s, now in her teens, came the cluster of roles on which she is rightly judged - each of them a study in some kind of deviant adolescent survival technique, playing characters whose sense of their own \"normality\" is at variance with the norm. The classic adolescent, in other words. She was riveting as the 14-year-old Wendy in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm (1997), and not even Lee's first choice for the part. That honour went to Natalie Portman - but when Portman's parents turned the role down, \"unsuitable\" for their daughter, Lee cast Ricci. He must have blessed the gods. No one else could have conveyed with such dispassion that fusion of amorality and innocence, the creative self-sufficiency of the young, as Wendy observes her parents' sexual antics with mixed tremors of pity and disgust. And never evincing surprise. Surprise is the one state you will never find in Miss Ricci. Just a shrug of resignation. Sure, rejection hurts she says - \"that they wanted someone else instead of you\". Two more versions of adolescent alienation followed. She was hysterically funny, and again insouciant, as the hard-boiled Dedee Truit in Don Roos's The Opposite Of Sex, pregnant and packing her gun, paying not so much as lip-service to conventional values and not caring what anyone thinks. And then, her best role, Layla in Vincent Gallo's Buffalo '66. The part seems made for her, and certainly Gallo, who wrote, directed and acts in what is virtually a two-hander, must have thought so. As Layla, naive, open-hearted, a kid abducted from her dance class by the bruised and crazed Gallo, who then falls in love with him, she is wanly haunting. She moves through the film like some phantom, untethered to reality, registering petulance where someone else would register terror, shrugging where others would weep, pulling down at the hem of her baby-doll dress. \"That was me, I didn't want anyone to see my underwear.\" In the bright-eyed candour of her face a mute appeal - but to what? She was brilliant. And how did Gallo repay her? He slagged her off in the press, \"I don't like her.\" Mocked her weight, mocked her work. Called her \"a puppet\" and \"an ungrateful cunt\", when the gratitude should have been all his. \"That's just Vincent,\" she says. \"Always lashing out, always trashing someone. Yeah, I'd work with him again. He's very talented.\" Pain and pragmatism. Not as divorced as sometimes they seem. She made lots of mistakes around this time, Ricci says - as how could she not? She gave interviews in which she said ridiculous things, things to shock. There was something about incest being \"normal\" - that word again. Something about a gun. Comments about the benefits of cruelly intensive diets. As though she were some character out of The Addams Family writ large, turning the world system upside down - which, in a sense, she was. \"I thought I was being funny.\" She was 18. \"I was called Goth. People made me sound weird. I think most people thought I was a freak. Someone dark, different... I know I am not average. But I am not dark. I am not even that odd.\" She thought she was being normal, playing out the normal disaffected kid. Anyone could see her life had not been normal. Out of family life at the age of 10, working in an environment -the movies - wholly removed from reality. But, within that world, fashioning versions of her own adolescent isolation seemed normal to her - it is what adolescents do. Adolescents are soloists - they have this in common with artists - and, if they identify at all, it is with other misfits - viz Ricci's roles. It is this that gives adolescents their pathos and their quality of the appalling. Lee understood this well in The Ice Storm. While the adults are enacting cliches of aberrant behaviour - adultery, partner-swapping at key parties, vodka in the afternoon - it is the kids who are truly subversive. And we fear them, rightly, as the film shows. What the adults in The Ice Storm take for unhappiness is merely what is normal. Normal unhappiness. Until the end, and their discovery of grief. (You suspect also that the kids will be better equipped to deal with grief - yet another reason for fearing them. As Ricci says, \"Children adapt the quickest.\") Ricci's background was normal, that is to say unhappy. Her dad was 56 when she was born - the last of four. It was his third marriage. And when asked if there were children by the previous marriages, Ricci replies, \"Not that we are aware of\" - the only time she gives a glib response. So begins the dispassion, questions you don't ask because you don't want to know the answer. Her mum, she says, was a good mum, but busy, \"Four kids\" and so she was \"mothered\" mostly by her sister Pia, four years older and now a teacher in Chicago. Pia was the good one, the one who never got into trouble. Christina was, of necessity, naughty. The kind of bright but obstreperous child teachers slap down knowing full well they'll bounce right up again. \"I think I knew from a very early age that there was nothing they could do to me. They couldn't put me in jail, so I could do what I wanted.\" Ricci's background was also abnormal. Though, for the most part, she didn't perceive it as such. Her dad was a therapist, specialising in primal scream therapy, based in the basement of their home in New Jersey, and the kids would come home from school to all this wailing and bawling inarticulacy rising up through the floorboards. And ignore it. \"It didn't have any impact on us at all. None of us took the slightest bit of notice. It wasn't a big deal.\" Children, as she has said, are quick to adapt. \"We were all very self-contained little entities who happened to live in the same house.\" As little entities they adapted, too, to his ideas of discipline. \"By the age of 10, we'd have to do our own laundry. Bed time was adjusted upwards by half-an-hour every other year until the age of 17, when there was no longer a curfew.\" (In an interview she once gave, she talked of the pleasure of being 17: \"No more curfew.\" By this time, she had been working for seven years, and was then living in her own flat with her boyfriend. Not that quick to adapt after all.) Family supper was at 5.30pm sharp. \"It was very strict, we all had to be there.\" And their father would regale them with his life's philosophy. He was, she says, \"a very paranoid man\" who taught them there is no such thing as selflessness, no one ever really likes you, people are only out for themselves - inversions of basic human values masquerading as survival. That makes The Addams Family look, well, normal. At least they shared human attributes of love and trust. What did her father think he was doing? \"I think he thought that because he was like that, so was everybody else. He was passing on his little secret to his children.\" She didn't believe him. \"I don't think it affected me because I decided it wasn't true. No way. Life couldn't be that way.\" But, like the curfew, these things are not so easily dispelled. To this day, she says, when hurt she makes very bad recoveries, but she's got a strategy for coping. \"On the whole, I don't give people a second chance. They don't get to hurt me again.\" When confronted she prefers to capitulate. \"I'd do anything to avoid a fight.\" If challenged, \"I apologise.\" Afraid, I guess, that if pushed to the line her father's miserable little secret just might prove to be true. People don't like you. It's no surprise that she repeats so painstakingly Gallo's remarks about her. They must have had a horrible ring of familiarity. And what did she do - just shrugged and let him get away with it. She didn't let her father get away with it. She was 13 when her parents divorced and he left home. She had just finished filming the sequel to The Addams Family. For the next two years she saw him on and off, but since she was 15 they have had no contact at all. \"And I don't expect to have again. I know it sounds cold, but it was one of the first things I ever did in my life - to take care of myself. Decide that only people who deserve it can be in my life.\" She loved her mum. \"But I was awful with her, frightening. I just did whatever I wanted. Didn't come home if I didn't feel like it. Refused any sort of protection.\" She had become her own protector. One of the great benefits of getting older, she says, is that you get to create another family for yourself. Film became her family. Quite literally. You can see how it would work. An enclosed, safe little world. \"People who are kind to me.\" With \"regular hours\" - that would resonate. The crew are her brothers, looking after her. \"They carry me around.\" The director is the authority figure. She does what she is told. \"And I resent it.\" Naturally. Her mother always there with her - so she finally had the attention she must have been clamouring for. She has often said that she is not interested in her characters' emotions. Doesn't question their motivation. \"It seems very pretentious to me to talk about non-existent human feelings.\" She is not interested in inner reality. \"I try to play the reality.\" It is something she learned as a child actor. \"No one talks to you about emotions then. It is how I was trained. A technique I learned and have carried through.\" Funny how one world blends into another. You could almost think that she is talking here about what she learned in her childhood. And the even funnier thing is, she says, that the moment she started acting, all the bad behaviour stopped. As if swapping \"normal\" family life for the abnormal world of Hollywood normalised her, saved her from becoming like the lonely, lost dysfunctional characters she plays. Finally, she had a peer group - not a very normal one for the adolescent, true - but a group of people engaged in the same thing. And, in this sort of weird version of the world, she finds suddenly she fits. So she can't be cynical about Hollywood, she says. It may be a fantasy. \"All the glamour, the limos, the beautiful hotels.\" It's certainly not a reality. \"That's not how you live your life, that only happens from time to time.\" But we are all implicated in it, she says. Fantasy is our escape. All the time throughout the late 90s, when she was presenting herself as so tough, so cynical, she would go home to her apartment and there, under the bed, would be her scrapbook, in which she would paste pictures of her idealised life. \"Just the dreams that all little girls have. How I wanted my house to look. The dresses I'd wear. The car I wanted. That kind of stuff. I suppose it's funny, really.\" She'd cut out of Martha Stewart's bridal magazines photographs of the perfect wedding she would have, right down to the flowers and table settings. \"I liked to think I'd be engaged at 18, married at 20, have kids at 23. A perfect concept.\" But a bit of a constricted concept, because the problem was that it stopped at about 27. \"That's as far as it goes. The tragic accident in which you and your husband never get old and live together forever and ever.\" In her heart, she says, she never believed any of it. Neither the fantasy of the Goth, nor the fantasy of the little princess. She just wanted to get to play that part - for once. \"You know, be a fairy, be luminescent, sparkle. I'm sorry.\" She was trying to resist, she says, the idea that \"unhappiness is normal\". Because it seemed to her pragmatic, or plain good sense, to assume the worst. \"That something bad was going to happen. That happy people just aren't looking around them. They don't realise it is going to be their turn next.\" And then the realisation, and not necessarily a comfortable one - that most people are unhappy because their lives don't measure up to some fantasy of happiness that they have. That if you can accept unhappiness as part of life - then you may be well on the way to being happy. You make your own world, she says - to a large extent but not the whole extent. You can't be held responsible for everything.

Just glare frostily and talk in short sentences. \"Not very interesting,\" she says. \"I have never been much good at social disguise.\" I took her down to her car, a brand new Porsche Boxster. \"You won't judge me on my car, will you?\" she said.

      "body": "<p>The tiger is being lost. Animal by animal, its footprints are vanishing from the world's forests. But perhaps \"lost\" is the wrong word; destroyed is a more accurate description. It's a difficult fact to absorb. The tiger is a friend from childhood, poets' inspiration, emblem of nationhood; a creature synonymous with power, in whom force and beauty appear inseparable.</p> <p>The tiger is so much a part of our culture that its disappearance seems almost ridiculous. With it gone, how will we view Rousseau's famous image of the animal, or the stories of Kipling? What will it mean any longer to have \"the eye of the tiger\" or to \"put a tiger in your tank\"? In a million toy Noah's Arks, the animal will be as out of place as the dodo; and Blake's \"tyger\" will burn nowhere but in memory, his famous poem forever reading like a reproach. Above all, our sense of being able to protect the natural world will suffer a terrible blow: if we cannot save the tiger, what can we save?</p> <p>As recently as the start of the last century, there were some 100,000 tigers in the wild. They were so plentiful that trigger-happy British sportsmen and maharajahs vied to make the biggest number of kills. In the late 19th century, for example, George Yule, a British civil servant, gave up counting at 400, while the Maharajah of Surguja - clearly more competitive - recorded that he had despatched 1,100. Appalling as these massacres now seem, such hunting did not present an immediate threat to the tiger. In the 20s and 30s, when the hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett was tracking man-eaters in India, there were still plenty of the animals around.</p> <p>Reading Corbett's immensely entertaining accounts of his adventures, one is struck by two things: first, the intimate knowledge and respect that he had for tigers; and second, the terror that the animals inspired, not only among the Indians who shared their living space but also in Corbett, despite his gun and legendary tracking powers. Here he is on the trail of a tigress in Muktesar that has killed 24 people. Seated in a small tree, barely 8ft above the ground, with his legs dangling down, Corbett realises that the tiger is only 20ft away; worse, it has spotted him: \"The near proximity of a tiger in daylight, even when it has not seen you, causes a disturbance in the blood stream. When the tiger is not an ordinary one, however, but a man-eater and the time is 10 o'clock on a dark night, and you know that the man-eater is watching you, the disturbance in the blood stream becomes a storm.\"</p> <p>Even more than half a century on, Corbett's stories have a fantastic immediacy. We are never going to feel this kind of fear; we are no longer frightened of tigers. Instead, we are frightened for them. And, in its own way, that's perhaps as terrifying as anything Corbett ever experienced. The facts make grim reading: of the eight subspecies of tigers, three - the Caspian, Javan and Bali - are already extinct. Experts put remaining tiger numbers at somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000, although this could be an overestimate. Tiger populations are notoriously difficult to evaluate, despite recent technological advances that help keep track of their movements. About half of the animals left are Bengal tigers, on the Indian subcontinent. There are also 400-500 Siberian tigers in the Russian far east, a similar number of Sumatran tigers, merely 30 South China tigers and between 1,000-1,800 Indo-Chinese tigers surviving in small pockets from Myanmar to Vietnam.</p> <p>The causes of the animal's decline are depressingly familiar. They're the same ones that are killing off many other species: loss of habitat and remorseless poaching. In the tiger's case, the poaching is carried out largely to satisfy a demand for body parts in traditional Chinese medicine that shows no sign of waning. Weak law enforcement in tiger-range countries and consumer countries such as the US makes it possible for the killing to continue. As a commodity, the tiger is shredded with vulture-like efficiency: skin, whiskers, penis, tail, bones and claws, all parcelled up for open sale in markets throughout Asia.</p> <p>In the US, President Clinton signed the Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act in 1998. It is meant to enable law enforcement agents to seize illegal products, but according to the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carried out an undercover investigation in New York last year, well over half the stores visited were still stocking products containing, or claiming to contain, tiger body parts. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) recently claimed to have found parts for sale in Europe, too: 15% of the shops visited in Belgium, for example, had tiger products (no products were found in the UK). \"Governments say all the right things,\" says Stuart Chapman, head of the Wildlife Trade Programme for WWF in the UK, \"but, a lot of the time, they're simply not doing them.\"</p> <p>Last April, the UN's Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), issued a damning report on how India is caring for its tigers, claiming that the government is failing to allocate resources where they are needed and displaying a lack of concern and effort. Tiger losses to poachers, says Cites, are being covered up by officials, and figures for the remaining animals deliberately inflated. \"We believe the rate of decline among India's tiger population is accelerating and is now close to freefall,\" says Rob Hepworth, the senior official behind the report.</p> <p>In the struggle to preserve the tiger, there have, however, been some victories along the way. Governments have been persuaded to pass protective legislation (which, if not always strictly enforced, is at least in place to be so), and the actions of poachers and those selling tiger products have been seriously hindered. Tiger conservation has added enormously to our knowledge of how these extraordinary creatures live and reproduce.</p> <p>But the campaign has also suffered serious reversals. The tiger hunts in its forests as it has always done, but around it the world changes more rapidly and unpredictably than ever.Exxon might be on the side of the animal with its Save the Tiger Fund, but here is Shell, just last month, announcing plans to survey the Sunderbans area of Bangladesh and drill-test wells. The area is potentially rich in sources of oil and gas; it is also the world's largest tiger reserve. And despite restrictions on the sale of tiger products, poaching continues. \"Now they're being killed for their skin, teeth and claws,\" claims the WWF's Chapman. \"There has been a market shift. Tigers are now fuelling the curio trade. You can buy small squares of skin in markets all over Asia.\"</p> <p>The situation of the Siberian, or Amur, tiger provides one of the best examples of this shifting threat. It is the largest tiger in the world, standing five to ten centimetres taller than its Bengal relative, and in winter its fur grows thick and long, making it look even larger. It lives in the Sikhote-Alin mountains, in the far east corner of the one-time Soviet Union, a vast area sparsely populated by humans, where it must range far and wide to find prey. Thanks to extensive hunting, the number of Siberian tigers was down to a mere 50 or so in 1936. In the 40s, however, it began receiving state protection, which resulted in a gradual recovery, so much so that by the mid-80s it was estimated that there were more than 250 Siberian tigers in the wild. Then came the collapse of the Soviet Union and, with the breakdown of law and order, the tigers were once more open to attack. By 1992, more than a third of the population had been wiped out, and the animal was back on the critical list.</p> <p>Since then, several wildlife organisations, working closely with Russian environmental ministries and scientific institutes, have managed yet again to haul the Siberian tiger back from the brink. New protected areas have been created, and poaching drastically reduced. Last year, estimates put the tiger population at upwards of 500. \"It was one of the success stories of the 90s,\" says Chapman. Tiger experts as prominent as Dr John Seidensticker, chairman of the Save The Tiger Fund, were beginning to believe that the Siberian now had one of the best chances of survival of any of the world's tigers. Although there are far more tigers in India, many of these live in small, stressed groups, whereas the Siberian tiger lives in a more or less continuous habitat. \"No other tiger population inhabits a vast and almost roadless area of forested mountains, very thinly populated by human beings,\" writes the novelist-explorer Peter Matthiessen in his book Tigers In The Snow (North Point Press). \"Also, despite its dangerously low numbers, altaica (the Siberian tiger) is slowly increasing, while tigris ( the Bengal tiger), beset by Homo sapiens, continues its remorseless, slow decline.\"</p> <p>Then, in May, came catastrophe: possibly in response to lobbying from Russian oil and timber firms, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, announced that he was abolishing the State Committee for Environmental Protection and the Federal Forestry Reserve, the two agencies that helped protect the Siberian tiger. \"The decision is a disaster for the tiger,\" says Igor Chestin, director of the Russian office of the WWF. \"Without the help of the Forestry Reserve, it will be hard to avoid and contain forest fires, which regularly threaten the tiger population. Poaching will increase and core areas of the tiger's habitat are under threat from development. The minister for natural resources stated recently that certain protected areas contain some of the richest mining prospects. That really reveals his attitude.\"</p> <p>Following Putin's announcement, many hundreds of letters from concerned groups and prominent individuals in Russia were sent to his office in Moscow, asking him to revise his decision. \"There was no response,\" Chestin says flatly. \"Nothing.\"</p> <p>In a last-ditch effort to change the situation, Russian environmentalists are turning to drastic measures. They are trying to call a national referendum. \"It's the only legal action left to us,\" says Chestin. According to Russian constitutional law, they have three months to collect two million signatures from people in at least 10 regions of the country. Not more than 10% of the signatures must come from any one region. \"Once we get them,\" says Chestin, \"they need to be validated, and then the president has 30 days to announce the date for a referendum.\" He is optimistic about the outcome, but in a battle between the Siberian tiger and large-scale, state-sanctioned economic interests, the animal's fate looks desperately perilous.</p> <p>We can read stories such as this, absorb all the dire predictions, but denial persists when it comes to the tiger. How can the animal vanish? Only a tiny minority of us will ever see one in the wild, but few creatures are more familiar or easier to conjure up in the mind's eye. The great, blunt head, the golden eyes, the long, dappled body incapable, it seems, of a single ungraceful moment. The tiger is a core image, colouring the picture books and jigsaws of our childhood, friendly and sinister in equal measure, both Tigger and Shere Khan. Kipling used his tiger to go to the heart of man's uneasy relationship with the natural world. Instinctive enemies from the start, Mowgli and Shere Khan's fates are inextricably bound together, not simply as individuals but also as representatives of their species. It is the very first of the tigers, who, in The Jungle Book, introduces violence into the forest and who teaches man to kill. \"O blind and foolish!\" the first tiger is told. \"Thou hast untied the feet of Death and he will follow thy trail till thou diest.\"</p> <p>Others have appropriated the animal as emblem and metaphor, from Rocky Balboa to Blake, who famously found in the tiger an image of the sublime fury of creation. It has been woven into religious tradition, decorating temples throughout the Buddhist world. In Hinduism, the female deity Durga rides on a tiger. In China, every twelfth year is dedicated to the animal. It has appeared on banknotes and national crests, provided the symbol for the Seoul Olympics, given its name to the rapid economic advance of Asian countries, sold products ranging from petrol to frosted cereal flakes and stamps.</p> <p>But there's a danger to this familiarity. Endowed with the mysterious substantiality of legend, the animal seems untouchable. It's easy to forget there's quite another kind of tiger, equally mysterious, perhaps, but far more defenceless: the real one.</p> <p>Predicting how - or whether - the tiger can survive the enormous pressures facing it depends on understanding the animal itself. The tiger is both resilient and vulnerable by its very nature. In its favour are several important characteristics. One is its extreme secretiveness. Sightings of tigers in the wild are rare, even for those people who make it their mission to study them. This makes it harder for poachers to hunt and kill them. In terms of habitat, the tiger is also remarkably tolerant, managing to exist in a broad variety of terrains, from swamp and mangrove to tropical rainforest, to the chilly, coniferous-deciduous forests of eastern Russia.</p> <p>As a hunter it is equally adaptable. The tiger hunts by stealth, stalking its prey before a sudden, explosive rush to make the kill. But not all prey are put to death in the same way. Methods vary according to the size and species of the prey and also among individual tigers who may change their technique with experience. This allows the tiger to capture a wide variety and size of animals.</p> <p>In addition, the tiger is a phenomenal breeder. Unlike many other endangered species - the notoriously picky panda springs instantly to mind - the tiger mates readily and produces relatively large litters. And if one litter is lost, it is quick to start the cycle all over again. In captivity, the animal breeds so enthusiastically that adults need to be separated and contraceptives are commonly used to prevent unwanted cubs. This might help to explain why the widespread hunting of the animal in the 19th century did little to diminish its population. As long as habitat and prey remained intact, the tiger was able to recover fairly rapidly.</p> <p>But the thing we most admire about the tiger - its sheer force - is also its downfall. The tiger is a super-predator, the biggest carnivore in Asia. A tigress needs 5-6kg of meat a day just to stay alive. To get this, she needs to kill upwards of 3,000kg of meat on the hoof every year. Depending on the availability of prey, each tiger requires vast expanses of territory. \"Many people are unwilling to face the fact that tigers have very specific needs,\" maintains Dr Ullas Karanth, who, on behalf of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, spends a large chunk of every year researching tigers and the conservation issues surrounding them in India's Nagarahole State Park. \"In Nagarahole, among a population of 20 pairs of breeding tigers, each female needs 15 sq km. That's a total of between 300-400 sq km. But you can multiply that figure by 10 or 20 for the Siberian tiger, which has a much poorer quality of habitat.\" And the areas that tigers inhabit need to be intact, little used by humans - no logging, mining, farming or large numbers of livestock.</p> <p>Tigers take up space. And they are dangerous. Corbett was always vehement in stressing that the vast majority of tigers do not prey on man. This could be from caution or simply a dislike for the taste of human flesh. But if they are too disabled to hunt their usual prey, or feel themselves under direct threat, tigers will attack people. When you combine this fact with the resentment that many who live in close proximity to the tiger feel about the way the animal has been afforded land needed by them and their families, the tiger can seem a murderous pest rather than a treasured asset. \"Once confrontation between man and tiger is set up,\" says Karanth, \"the tiger is always the loser.\"</p> <p>\"Curving oceans and the planet's wastes keep us apart in vain,\" wrote Jorge Luis Borges in his poem, The Other Tiger. \"From here in a house far off in South America I dream of you, track you, O tiger of the Ganges' banks.\" When he wrote these words, Borges had no way of knowing that there could come a time in the not too distant future when the only wild tigers left would be those of the imagination.</p> <p>What would it take to save them? Last year, Tigers 2000, the largest ever gathering of tiger experts, was held in the Zoological Society, London, to explore this question. The findings, though complex in discussion, came down to a few key issues: protective legislation needs to be stronger and properly enforced; there must be a shift of focus from counting tiger numbers to understanding and maintaining tiger habitat, not simply in terms of pockets of land but as part of the larger landscape; and, above all, we need to work out how tigers fit in with the people who live around them.</p> <p>How can a sustainable relationship be created between tiger and man? Whether the tiger stays or goes depends to a great extent on the will of local people. Only if the value of a live tiger rises above that of a dead one will the species be saved. Locals need to be promptly and sufficiently compensated for loss of livestock to tigers. It must be made worth their while to relocate if necessary. And there should be real incentives for them to help fight poaching. Along with all this, communities living near tigers need to be given the opportunity to change their attitude to the animal. If they could be persuaded to view tigers with pride instead of resentment or indifference, they would become participants in the struggle to save them.</p> <p>All this takes money. And it takes political will, both at a national and local level. Conservationists are not exactly optimistic about the tiger's fate. Their predictions are too hedged with \"ifs\" and \"maybes\". But they do have hope: \"The beauty of working in conservation,\" says the WWF's Chapman, \"is you see the ability of nature to bounce back. History is littered with examples of mammals reduced to tens of individuals making a comeback. Given the right circumstances, tigers could recover. Small victories add up.\"</p> <p>\"I see the tiger disappearing in certain areas,\" says Dr Paul Toyne, species conservation officer for the WWF. \"Isolated pockets will probably go. But there are areas where commitment is strong and the environment is viable.\" Karanth is wary of making such predictions. \"The tiger has been portrayed as a lost cause, but this is too simplistic. I still believe there will be a place for tigers, but only if we get our act together right now.\"</p> <p>But should we be putting all this effort into saving the wild tiger? The question is not as irrelevant as it seems. After all, we have plenty of tigers in captivity. As the environmental journalist Cory Meacham effectively points out in his book How The Tiger Lost Its Stripes (Harcourt Brace, 1997), the animal is in no danger of extinction. As long as demand for them continues, there will always be tigers in captivity because they are so easy to breed. Why don't we simply concentrate efforts on sustaining genetically viable populations of tigers with a view to reintroducing them back into the wild if and when needed?</p> <p>There are two main reasons why not: first, most tiger conservationists don't think it can be done - tigers learn how to hunt, avoid danger and look after their young from their wild mothers; and even if it could be done, as some believe, the process would be very costly. The second reason is that the tiger is what is known as an \"umbrella\" species: it needs a wide diversity of prey animals, and the vegetation to support them. Without the tiger, everything that exists in its habitat will be under threat. \"If we want to reintroduce the tiger into the wild,\" says Dr Toyne, \"there needs to be some habitat left. If we haven't got rid of the problems that caused the tiger's decline in the first place, there's absolutely no point to reintroduction.\"</p> <p>The environmental arguments aside, the most compelling reason to continue to fight for the tiger is an emotional one. We may admire the animal for its looks, its power, but what we love about the tiger - what truly stirs our imagination - is something far harder to define: its wildness. In the open forest, the creature has an aura that even those accustomed to working with tigers find hard to describe. \"All I know,\" says Karanth, \"is that each sighting of a wild tiger is unique. I have seen hundreds in my life, but each time is like the first.\"</p> <p>The zoo in the hill station of Darjeeling in north east India has a tiger. I was on holiday there, and went to see it. Three young men were clustered around the animal's small cage, poking at it with a stick. The tiger rumbled with irritation and the men jumped back, laughing to cover their momentary fear. The tiger paced back and forth close to the mesh of the cage and growled, and the men laughed again. The laughter was different this time. Although the tiger was unbelievably powerful, all colour and weight and anger, the men knew that the three of them, with their one small stick, were the ones with the real power. Perhaps of all animals, the tiger appears most diminished by captivity. Some essence - as fundamental as the stripes on its back - seems lost forever once it is put behind fences.</p> <p>We need wild tigers. We need them because they are the closest we come to the creatures of myth - to unicorn or minotaur. There was a time when we barricaded our doors against the animals of the night. Now we sleep easier knowing they are still there</p> <p>For further information, contact: <br><a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org\" target=\"_NEW\">The Environmental Investigation Agency</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nbs.it/tiger\" target=\"_NEW\"> Wildlife Protection Society of India</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.5tigers.org\" target=\"_NEW\">5 Tigers: The Tiger Information Center</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.uidaho.edu/rsrch/hwi\" target=\"_NEW\">Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org\" target=\"_NEW\">TRAFFIC International</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.globaltigerpatrol.co.uk.\" target=\"_NEW\">Global Tiger Patrol</a></p>",

The minister for natural resources stated recently that certain protected areas contain some of the richest mining prospects. That really reveals his attitude.\" Following Putin's announcement, many hundreds of letters from concerned groups and prominent individuals in Russia were sent to his office in Moscow, asking him to revise his decision. \"There was no response,\" Chestin says flatly. \"Nothing.\" In a last-ditch effort to change the situation, Russian environmentalists are turning to drastic measures. They are trying to call a national referendum. \"It's the only legal action left to us,\" says Chestin. According to Russian constitutional law, they have three months to collect two million signatures from people in at least 10 regions of the country. Not more than 10% of the signatures must come from any one region. \"Once we get them,\" says Chestin, \"they need to be validated, and then the president has 30 days to announce the date for a referendum.\" He is optimistic about the outcome, but in a battle between the Siberian tiger and large-scale, state-sanctioned economic interests, the animal's fate looks desperately perilous. We can read stories such as this, absorb all the dire predictions, but denial persists when it comes to the tiger. How can the animal vanish? Only a tiny minority of us will ever see one in the wild, but few creatures are more familiar or easier to conjure up in the mind's eye. The great, blunt head, the golden eyes, the long, dappled body incapable, it seems, of a single ungraceful moment. The tiger is a core image, colouring the picture books and jigsaws of our childhood, friendly and sinister in equal measure, both Tigger and Shere Khan. Kipling used his tiger to go to the heart of man's uneasy relationship with the natural world. Instinctive enemies from the start, Mowgli and Shere Khan's fates are inextricably bound together, not simply as individuals but also as representatives of their species. It is the very first of the tigers, who, in The Jungle Book, introduces violence into the forest and who teaches man to kill. \"O blind and foolish!\" the first tiger is told. \"Thou hast untied the feet of Death and he will follow thy trail till thou diest.\" Others have appropriated the animal as emblem and metaphor, from Rocky Balboa to Blake, who famously found in the tiger an image of the sublime fury of creation. It has been woven into religious tradition, decorating temples throughout the Buddhist world. In Hinduism, the female deity Durga rides on a tiger. In China, every twelfth year is dedicated to the animal. It has appeared on banknotes and national crests, provided the symbol for the Seoul Olympics, given its name to the rapid economic advance of Asian countries, sold products ranging from petrol to frosted cereal flakes and stamps. But there's a danger to this familiarity. Endowed with the mysterious substantiality of legend, the animal seems untouchable. It's easy to forget there's quite another kind of tiger, equally mysterious, perhaps, but far more defenceless: the real one. Predicting how - or whether - the tiger can survive the enormous pressures facing it depends on understanding the animal itself. The tiger is both resilient and vulnerable by its very nature. In its favour are several important characteristics. One is its extreme secretiveness. Sightings of tigers in the wild are rare, even for those people who make it their mission to study them. This makes it harder for poachers to hunt and kill them. In terms of habitat, the tiger is also remarkably tolerant, managing to exist in a broad variety of terrains, from swamp and mangrove to tropical rainforest, to the chilly, coniferous-deciduous forests of eastern Russia. As a hunter it is equally adaptable. The tiger hunts by stealth, stalking its prey before a sudden, explosive rush to make the kill. But not all prey are put to death in the same way. Methods vary according to the size and species of the prey and also among individual tigers who may change their technique with experience. This allows the tiger to capture a wide variety and size of animals. In addition, the tiger is a phenomenal breeder. Unlike many other endangered species - the notoriously picky panda springs instantly to mind - the tiger mates readily and produces relatively large litters. And if one litter is lost, it is quick to start the cycle all over again. In captivity, the animal breeds so enthusiastically that adults need to be separated and contraceptives are commonly used to prevent unwanted cubs. This might help to explain why the widespread hunting of the animal in the 19th century did little to diminish its population. As long as habitat and prey remained intact, the tiger was able to recover fairly rapidly. But the thing we most admire about the tiger - its sheer force - is also its downfall. The tiger is a super-predator, the biggest carnivore in Asia. A tigress needs 5-6kg of meat a day just to stay alive. To get this, she needs to kill upwards of 3,000kg of meat on the hoof every year. Depending on the availability of prey, each tiger requires vast expanses of territory. \"Many people are unwilling to face the fact that tigers have very specific needs,\" maintains Dr Ullas Karanth, who, on behalf of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, spends a large chunk of every year researching tigers and the conservation issues surrounding them in India's Nagarahole State Park. \"In Nagarahole, among a population of 20 pairs of breeding tigers, each female needs 15 sq km. That's a total of between 300-400 sq km. But you can multiply that figure by 10 or 20 for the Siberian tiger, which has a much poorer quality of habitat.\" And the areas that tigers inhabit need to be intact, little used by humans - no logging, mining, farming or large numbers of livestock. Tigers take up space. And they are dangerous. Corbett was always vehement in stressing that the vast majority of tigers do not prey on man. This could be from caution or simply a dislike for the taste of human flesh. But if they are too disabled to hunt their usual prey, or feel themselves under direct threat, tigers will attack people. When you combine this fact with the resentment that many who live in close proximity to the tiger feel about the way the animal has been afforded land needed by them and their families, the tiger can seem a murderous pest rather than a treasured asset. \"Once confrontation between man and tiger is set up,\" says Karanth, \"the tiger is always the loser.\" \"Curving oceans and the planet's wastes keep us apart in vain,\" wrote Jorge Luis Borges in his poem, The Other Tiger. \"From here in a house far off in South America I dream of you, track you, O tiger of the Ganges' banks.\" When he wrote these words, Borges had no way of knowing that there could come a time in the not too distant future when the only wild tigers left would be those of the imagination. What would it take to save them? Last year, Tigers 2000, the largest ever gathering of tiger experts, was held in the Zoological Society, London, to explore this question. The findings, though complex in discussion, came down to a few key issues: protective legislation needs to be stronger and properly enforced; there must be a shift of focus from counting tiger numbers to understanding and maintaining tiger habitat, not simply in terms of pockets of land but as part of the larger landscape; and, above all, we need to work out how tigers fit in with the people who live around them. How can a sustainable relationship be created between tiger and man? Whether the tiger stays or goes depends to a great extent on the will of local people. Only if the value of a live tiger rises above that of a dead one will the species be saved. Locals need to be promptly and sufficiently compensated for loss of livestock to tigers. It must be made worth their while to relocate if necessary. And there should be real incentives for them to help fight poaching. Along with all this, communities living near tigers need to be given the opportunity to change their attitude to the animal. If they could be persuaded to view tigers with pride instead of resentment or indifference, they would become participants in the struggle to save them. All this takes money. And it takes political will, both at a national and local level. Conservationists are not exactly optimistic about the tiger's fate. Their predictions are too hedged with \"ifs\" and \"maybes\". But they do have hope: \"The beauty of working in conservation,\" says the WWF's Chapman, \"is you see the ability of nature to bounce back. History is littered with examples of mammals reduced to tens of individuals making a comeback. Given the right circumstances, tigers could recover. Small victories add up.\" \"I see the tiger disappearing in certain areas,\" says Dr Paul Toyne, species conservation officer for the WWF. \"Isolated pockets will probably go. But there are areas where commitment is strong and the environment is viable.\" Karanth is wary of making such predictions. \"The tiger has been portrayed as a lost cause, but this is too simplistic. I still believe there will be a place for tigers, but only if we get our act together right now.\" But should we be putting all this effort into saving the wild tiger? The question is not as irrelevant as it seems. After all, we have plenty of tigers in captivity. As the environmental journalist Cory Meacham effectively points out in his book How The Tiger Lost Its Stripes (Harcourt Brace, 1997), the animal is in no danger of extinction. As long as demand for them continues, there will always be tigers in captivity because they are so easy to breed. Why don't we simply concentrate efforts on sustaining genetically viable populations of tigers with a view to reintroducing them back into the wild if and when needed? There are two main reasons why not: first, most tiger conservationists don't think it can be done - tigers learn how to hunt, avoid danger and look after their young from their wild mothers; and even if it could be done, as some believe, the process would be very costly. The second reason is that the tiger is what is known as an \"umbrella\" species: it needs a wide diversity of prey animals, and the vegetation to support them. Without the tiger, everything that exists in its habitat will be under threat. \"If we want to reintroduce the tiger into the wild,\" says Dr Toyne, \"there needs to be some habitat left. If we haven't got rid of the problems that caused the tiger's decline in the first place, there's absolutely no point to reintroduction.\" The environmental arguments aside, the most compelling reason to continue to fight for the tiger is an emotional one. We may admire the animal for its looks, its power, but what we love about the tiger - what truly stirs our imagination - is something far harder to define: its wildness. In the open forest, the creature has an aura that even those accustomed to working with tigers find hard to describe. \"All I know,\" says Karanth, \"is that each sighting of a wild tiger is unique. I have seen hundreds in my life, but each time is like the first.\" The zoo in the hill station of Darjeeling in north east India has a tiger. I was on holiday there, and went to see it. Three young men were clustered around the animal's small cage, poking at it with a stick. The tiger rumbled with irritation and the men jumped back, laughing to cover their momentary fear. The tiger paced back and forth close to the mesh of the cage and growled, and the men laughed again. The laughter was different this time. Although the tiger was unbelievably powerful, all colour and weight and anger, the men knew that the three of them, with their one small stick, were the ones with the real power. Perhaps of all animals, the tiger appears most diminished by captivity. Some essence - as fundamental as the stripes on its back - seems lost forever once it is put behind fences. We need wild tigers. We need them because they are the closest we come to the creatures of myth - to unicorn or minotaur. There was a time when we barricaded our doors against the animals of the night. Now we sleep easier knowing they are still there For further information, contact: The Environmental Investigation Agency Wildlife Protection Society of India 5 Tigers: The Tiger Information Center Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute TRAFFIC International Global Tiger Patrol",

      "body": "<p>There can be few jobs in the world more seductive for the ambitious than the presidency of the United States of America. And few can leave a bigger psychological vacuum when full-time is called. Compared to the surviving Republican ex-presidents- Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush senior - Jimmy Carter is exceptional. \"Look, this guy is not playing golf every day\", says Patt Derian, who ran Carter's human rights policy in the State Department. \"He refuses to sit on corporate boards. He is not on the lecture circuit making speeches for high fees. In setting a good image of what an ex-president can do, he's terrific\". An American commentator once quipped that Jimmy Carter \"used the presidency as a stepping stone to what he really wanted to do in life\". Others have developed a special word for his 20 event-filled years out of power. They call it \"the postpresidency\". </p> <p>Against powerful odds Carter has turned his presidential after-life into a whirlwind of mediation in international conflicts, defending democracy in preventing controversial foreign elections succumbing to fraud, and in pioneering medical and agricultural programmes in the Third World. \"Waging peace\", as he calls it, Carter has exploited his prestige to do good. Through his Carter Center he has negotiated with some of the world's most controversial men. As a private citizen who counts himself a friend of Cuba's Fidel Castro and the latest Washington bugbear, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, and of North Korea's late dictator Kim Il Sung, Carter reaches parts that no serving American president has ever done. </p> <p>Three years before the start of the so-called Oslo process, which brought Israel and the Palestinians to their first agreements, Carter met the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and urged him to start negotiations and recognise Israel. When war almost erupted in the Korean peninsula in 1994, Carter brought both sides back from the brink by denouncing US plans for sanctions against North Korea and persuading the North Korean leader to freeze his nuclear programme and resume access for international inspectors. Carter even offered to step into the current Bush-Gore vote-counting crisis. He recognises that as a Democrat he could not act as a lone mediator, but he believes that, \"if Gerald Ford agreed and we were invited by a higher authority, we could go to Gore and Bush and suggest a hand count in all of Florida's counties. We could have a Blue Ribbon Commission that spoke with a non-partisan voice\". </p> <p>So could Carter be a role model for Bill Clinton, another (soon to be) ex Democrat president facing life after the White House? Like Carter, Clinton will only be in his mid-50s as he leaves power. Faced with a possible quarter-century of good health, can he even begin to emulate the results of the other Democrat former governor from the Deep South who made it to the presidency? </p> <p>Today younger Americans tend to know only four things about Jimmy Carter - peanut farmer, big smile, born-again Christian, the Camp David accords (which ended the state of war between Israel and Egypt). He had the ability not just to live by high moral standards but to turn them into a political plus. He promised the American public \"never to tell a lie, and to do nothing of which you or I will be ashamed\" and campaigned on a clean-up ticket, denouncing the crimes of the CIA, the lies of Watergate, and the folly of the Vietnam war. He attacked the primitive anti-Communism which had led the United States to empower a series of right-wing dictators in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. He promoted human rights as a guiding principle of US foreign policy in place of the balance of power cynicism of Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. </p> <p>Top politicians seem to need a hefty dose of blind self-confidence and Carter certainly had it. It irritated friend and foe alike. \"He has no self-criticism. He'll say something self-deprecating with a sunny smile because he doesn't think it's true. He tries to be humble but he doesn't understand what the word means,\" says Patt Derian. \"He's very hard to understand, because he doesn't have any counterparts in literature or the movies for people to compare with. He's wonderful and maddening and quite eccentric.\" </p> <p>His many critics may overlook the fact that his laptop still opens to a picture of the Seal of the President of the United States and a few bars from \"Hail to the Chief\". More difficult is what one former senior employee calls \"his regal style\". \"It's still like the White House in there [in the Carter Center]. It's very hierarchical, and focussed round him. Very few people who work there ever interact with him, or even see him\". In the words of another ex-staffer, \"He's quite vain about his rightness. He doesn't like to work co-operatively. He likes people to work for him\". </p> <p> Whatever the source of Jimmy Carter's sometimes grandiose manner, it was not evident in his early years. He was born in 1924 on a hardworking farm in Georgia, in the segregated Deep South. His mother was a registered nurse while his ferociously demanding father ran the farm. Carter was the eldest child, and his father expected him to work long hours on the farm and in their shop, which mainly served the 200 black men and women who worked their land, either as hired hands or sharecroppers. \"My biggest ambition was to please my father\", Carter says. </p> <p>Home life was austere. With no indoor plumbing, theirs was no stereotypical Southern plantation. The elder Carters had few friends and saw relations rarely. During meals, family members were allowed to read to make up for the taut and limited conversation. When Jimmy Carter married Rosalynn Smith, a local girl, he was surprised by her family's long, lively, and cheerful mealtimes and the frequent visits from relatives. </p> <p>The Carters' nearest neighbours were their black staff. The young Jimmy played, fished, swam, and hid in the woods with Afro- American children. \"I was basically shaped by five people, only two of whom were white\", he boasts. While this means that he alone of modern presidents except for Bill Clinton has \"a high comfort level with blacks\",Carter was slow to champion black political rights. </p> <p>He accepts he could have done more in the 50s and 60s on civil rights. \"I didn't march across the Selma bridge or do things of that kind\", he says. \"But I don't regret it. If I had done that it would have been absolutely impossible to be elected to office or become governor of Georgia and then president. When I finally became governor in 66 I said in my inaugural speech that the time for racial discrimination was over. Two months later I was on the front cover of Time magazine, which launched me into the national arena.\" </p> <p>Andrew Young, Martin Luther King's close aide, who later became Carter's ambassador to the United Nations, defends Carter's initial caution on civil rights. \"As governor he intervened privately in some very explosive situations. We had to support him in order to stop George Wallace (the racist Governor of Alabama). Carter was as quiet in his efforts at reconciliation as Wallace was vocal in polarisation.\" </p> <p>On Earl Carter's death from pancreatic cancer in his 50s (Jimmy's three younger siblings were later to die at the same age from the same cancer), the future president had abandoned his career in the Navy to return to Georgia to look after what had become a large farm business. Earl Carter had pioneered new seeds and herbicides and, as a recognised local leader, had joined the state legislature. It was natural that Jimmy would later use the family money to follow in his footsteps and run for state office. </p> <p>His vibrant Christian faith also set Carter apart from other public figures. While church-going is a necessary ritual for most presidents, he was genuinely devout. His \"born-again\" experience came shortly after he lost the race to become Georgia's governor in 1966. Apparently feeling betrayed by God, he went on a long walk in the woods near Plains with his younger sister, Ruth, who practised faith healing. She persuaded him to make a \"total commitment\" to Jesus, which he did. His optimism revived. For a time he became a door-to-door salesman for Jesus, handing out Bibles in various parts of the United States and Mexico. Even in the White House he continued to preach at Sunday School. He always said grace before meals, even at state dinners with foreign leaders. A close friend of the evangelist Billy Graham, Carter still regularly runs Bible classes at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains. \"His faith is not a department of his life. It is the whole superstructure that holds his life together. Miss that and you miss who he is,\" says the Reverend Daniel Ariail, the church's pastor. </p> <p>Nowadays, when he is not travelling or at home in Plains, the ex-president is ensconced in the spacious offices of his Carter Center on a hill overlooking Atlanta. He has almost immediate access to any foreign head of government as well as to multimillionaires like CNN's Ted Turner and Microsoft's Bill Gates, both of whom have financed his work. Thanks to the centre's health programmes, the guinea-worm disease which once afflicted three Asian and 19 sub-Saharan countries is almost eradicated. When the centre - which has also received funding from sources including major drug companies and the British government - took up the issue in 1986 there were 3.5m guinea-worm cases worldwide. Now there are only 86,000. </p> <p>The centre is also tackling river blindness, which affects around 20m people in Africa and Latin America. Global 2000, Carter's agricultural programme, is trying - with only mixed success - to bring the Green Revolution to Africa. </p> <p>At 76, and despite regular jogging, Carter's back is a little stooped, but the broad smile still switches on and off like a light. In angry moods, its sudden disappearance becomes a weapon. He is more relaxed and comfortable than he was in the White House, like a man who knows he has accomplished much and finally achieved recognition. </p> <p>But the pain of his 1980 defeat still hurts. He expected to win a second term. \"I was embarrassed to have lost. I was distressed because I felt Reagan was not qualified temperamentally or philosophically to be president. Being defeated as an incumbent is an extreme disappointment,\" he says. Carter also suffered heavily from 1979's year-long hostage crisis after the American embassy in Iran was blockaded by militant Islamic students. When in 1980 an effort to rescue the US diplomats collapsed after an American helicopter collided with a transport plane in the Iranian desert, killing eight US servicemen, the crisis became a symbol of the \"weakness\" which Reagan claimed was at the heart of the Carter presidency. </p> <p> The irony was that, after 11 years in the Navy from 1943 to 1954, Carter had had a longer military career than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower. He also embarked on the massive increase in the US defence budget which Reagan continued. What was remarkable, however, was that no American soldier was killed by enemy fire throughout Carter's presidency, - a record of non-interventionism matched by none of his successors. </p> <p>In deep depression, Carter and his wife Rosalynn returned to their farm in the tiny town of Plains (population0 600). Like Clinton, who will return to private life heavily in debt, Carter found his peanut-processing warehouse had gone downhill and was close to bankruptcy. But he is a man of many parts. He enjoys fly-fishing, hunting, birdwatching and car pentry, is a fan of Dylan Thomas and writes his own poetry. He picked himself up by laying a tongue-and-groove floor in his attic and liquidating his business. In seclusion, he embarked on his memoirs, \"using the very meticulous diary I had kept as a fetish\". </p> <p>The idea for a conflict resolution centre emerged suddenly. \"We were begging for money for the presidential library and I decided I didn't want to have a sterile place where people would come and look at the records. I woke up one night and thought we could have a place here in a congenial atmosphere, similar to Camp David, where people who were in dispute and didn't want to go to the UN or the US government could come,\" he recalls. </p> <p>Naturally, he started in the Middle East but his first efforts were not very successful. He was invited to Iraq by Saddam Hussein in 1986 but quiet preparations for a role in brokering peace with Iran came to nothing and Carter never went to Baghdad. He did better in Syria, where he opened talks with President Assad, and he started the first overtures to Yasser Arafat. To continue the focus on human rights, Carter decided to add election monitoring to the centre's work. He set up a Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government, including several Latin American presidents, to focus on democracy in the hemisphere. </p> <p>The breakthrough, which brought him a kind of rehabilitation in the American media after almost a decade in the wilderness, came in General Noriega's Panama in 1989. Carter demanded to be allowed to send observers to the elections, and watched in horror as voting records were changed and falsified in front of him. \"Are you honest or are you thieves?\", he shouted in secondary-school Spanish before calling a press conference to denounce the election. Noriega ordered Carter and his team to leave the country, declared a state of emergency and repudiated the election as null and void. Carter had shown he could be tough as well as tender. His stock in the United States rose again. But President Bush was planning military intervention against Noriega, and Carter put all his energy into trying to prevent it, hoping that a mediator, backed by powerful political pressure, could persuade Noriega to go into exile. The effort failed and US troops invaded Panama. </p> <p>Carter's stand persuaded Nicaragua's Sandinista president Daniel Ortega to permit a team from the Carter Center to advise him on organising new election rules. Ortega hoped a fair poll would persuade the US to end its armed support for the Contra rebels. On election night, when shock results showed the Sandinistas were losing, Carter and his wife rushed to Ortega's headquarters to prevent any recourse to force. \"I've won an election, Daniel. I've lost an election. I can tell you from my own experience that losing is not the end of the world\", he declared. </p> <p>The arrival in Washington of a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, should have made Carter's life easier, but it had the opposite effect. \"Personally I have always gotten on well with Clinton but he has deliberately frozen out, whenever possible, the involvement of the Carter Center in arenas where I was convinced we could help\", Carter says bitterly. \"I have been to see Clinton about this personally several times. The cause for his attitude I have never understood\". </p> <p>Carter and Clinton could hardly be more different in their private lives. Although Carter once courted ridicule with a remark to Playboy magazine that he occasionally lusted after women \"in my heart\", he has been faithful to his wife for 54 years. Rosalynn travels with him on almost all his foreign trips, and has developed several mental health programmes at the Carter Center. Though none of their four children has followed in Carter's footsteps, either as farmers, naval officers, or politicians, they remain a close family. His youngest child, Amy, was a student radical and was briefly arrested for protesting against CIA recruiting on college campuses. Now married and the mother of a small child, she and her husband live in Atlanta, close to the centre. </p> <p>Carter first exhibited his negotiating skills at Camp David in 1978 with Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin. He still uses one of the techniques he developed there. He studies the subject thoroughly, tries to project himself into each protagonist's position, and then draws up \"what I think is a reasonable final solution before I even see the parties. Then I use that single document and make sure both sides know I use the same document so that there is no distrust of me\". Then he shuttles between them, trying to narrow the gap. He contrasts this technique with Henry Kissinger's. \"I don't think he would disagree. He tells one side one thing, and the other something else, and then keeps them apart as he talks\", Carter says. The key negotiating quality may be what Peter Bourne, a British doctor and longtime friend who worked in Carter's administration, describes as \"his capacity to put aside any moral judgement about people. It goes back to his Baptist background - there is no such thing as bad people, only bad actions.\" </p> <p>One of Carter's most successful missions was his trip to North Korea in 1994. He found himself quickly at ease with Kim Il Sung, the Communist leader of the world's most isolated state. \"He was 82, but extremely knowledgeable about everything in North Korea. He was congenial and very grateful that I had come. He went out of his way to let me know he had a deep appreciation for Christianity. He claimed Christian missionaries may have saved his life when he was imprisoned during the Japanese wartime occupation\", Carter remembers. </p> <p>Kim Il Sung authorised Carter to invite the president of South Korea to a summit meeting. But three weeks later the dictator died and it took his son, Kim Jong Il, six years to repeat the historic gesture and welcome South Korea's president to Pyongyang. </p> <p>Carter acknowledges that he likes to seek out people whom no official American will touch, though he gently deflects the idea that he enjoys supping with the devil to see what he is like. \"It is intriguing to meet Mobutu, Cedras (the former dictator of Haiti), and Kim Il Sung\", he smiles. \"They are pariahs, but my knowledge is that they are the key to the problem and without them no progress is possible\". </p> <p>Other leaders he meets are only pariahs in the US view. Carter wants to \"de-demonise\" them. The Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez was in Atlanta last month (without going to Washington). He admired Carter's willingness, when he was president, to court rightwing anger and prepare the treaties under which the Panama Canal was handed back. Cynics sometimes say Carter is the \"soft cop\" who can do the delicate work which the \"tough cop\" in Washington cannot. But his fierce independence and Clinton's manifest hostility and nervousness about the ex-president's role make that impossible. </p> <p>So is the Carter Center just a way of continuing his presidency and having the second White House term which fate denied him? Andrew Young vigorously denies it. \"I get angry with people who say he's been the greatest ex-president, because this interferes with the effort to understand him as president. He sought to implement an almost theological agenda - world peace, controlling nuclear proliferation, and the reconciliation of race and class. Since then, he has demonstrated, like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, that people who are not office-holders can have a moral impact on society, which is very difficult when you're locked into the checks and balances of a politician in power.\" </p> <p>Young says his main difference with Carter is the ex-president's relative lack of interest in macroeconomics to reduce poverty and inequalities. \"As Martin Luther King said, 'I admire the Good Samaritan but I'm not one myself. I want to change the Jericho road and not just go on picking people up who've been assaulted and robbed'.\" </p> <p>Within the growing community of non-governmental organisations which concentrate on conflict resolution in civil wars and failed Third World states, Carter is admired as a pioneer of so-called Track Two diplomacy - the effort by private individuals to broker settlements. But he is criticised for not having developed with time and experience. </p> <p>\"There's always been tension between Carter's role and his centre's ability to stand alone without him. He doesn't consult. He makes rash decisions,\" says the head of one London-based NGO. \"He's given an extra twist to the elder-statesman role and been good at high profile end-game diplomacy. But he has a low threshhold of tolerance for building up a variety of stake-holders and for long-haul activities,\" says Kevin Clements, head of International Alert, which works in the Sudan, one of the Carter Center's main areas. </p> <p>Ben Hoffman, director of the centre's conflict resolution programme, recognises the problem, especially as the staff is actually quite small, - only three full-time people and six interns from nearby Emory University. \"We need to stay involved longer, and do fewer things but hopefully better. We want to go deeper than a diplomatic inter-state perspective. We don't see the centre coming in and just doing elite-level efforts which achieve an agreement and then leave it to other people on the ground to take it on. We want to bridge the two.\" </p> <p>In recent years Carter has cut back his work load and now spends only one week a month in Atlanta. When they are not travelling, he and Rosalynn stay in their single-story ranch-style home in Plains. What the centre will eventually do without him, and his ability to raise funds and get high-level access to world figures, remains a thorny question. A $250m endowment is being built up to ensure the centre's future. </p> <p>Carter doesn't want the conflict resolution programme to become a mere think-tank. Half-a-dozen studies have been commissioned for new models of the centre. They have all foundered on Carter's unwillingness to decide. \"I doubt, and all our top trustee committees also doubt, that we can get one person to take my place. That is the general consensus which I don't challenge - or endorse,\" he says. </p> <p>In retrospect, and particularly in light of this year's bland choice of presidential candidates, it seems extraordinary that this complex man could ever have been elected president. But he emerged on the scene at a rare moment of American introspection. With his rigorous rejection of military intervention in office and since - he opposed the Gulf war and the Nato war on Yugoslavia - he almost sounds like a pacifist, yet as a former naval officer he is inordinately proud that the latest American submarine, bristling with nuclear missiles, has been named the USS Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>At a time when the danger of American unilateralism has never been greater, \"Carter has a sense of multilateralism\", says Robert White, the president of the Center for International Policy in Washington. \"He has a sincere and sophisticated drive to help build a peaceful and orderly world. I don't think his motives are unworthy.\" </p> <p><strong> James Earl Carter Junior </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> October 1 1924, Plains, Georgia. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Plains High School; Georgia Southwestern College; US Naval College, Annapolis. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1946 Rosalynn Smith (three sons, Jack, Chip, Jeffrey; one daughter, Amy). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> US Navy 1943-54; managed family farms and peanut business 1954-62. </p> <p><strong> Political career: </strong> Senator Georgia State Legislature 1962-66; governor of Georgia 1971-74; US president 1976-80. </p> <p><strong> Some books: </strong> Why Not The Best (1975), Keeping Faith, Memoirs Of A President (1982), Everything To Gain: Making The Most Of The Rest Of Your Life (with Rosalynn Carter) (1987), Always A Reckoning (poetry 1995).</p>",

It is the whole superstructure that holds his life together. Miss that and you miss who he is,\" says the Reverend Daniel Ariail, the church's pastor. Nowadays, when he is not travelling or at home in Plains, the ex-president is ensconced in the spacious offices of his Carter Center on a hill overlooking Atlanta. He has almost immediate access to any foreign head of government as well as to multimillionaires like CNN's Ted Turner and Microsoft's Bill Gates, both of whom have financed his work. Thanks to the centre's health programmes, the guinea-worm disease which once afflicted three Asian and 19 sub-Saharan countries is almost eradicated. When the centre - which has also received funding from sources including major drug companies and the British government - took up the issue in 1986 there were 3.5m guinea-worm cases worldwide. Now there are only 86,000. The centre is also tackling river blindness, which affects around 20m people in Africa and Latin America. Global 2000, Carter's agricultural programme, is trying - with only mixed success - to bring the Green Revolution to Africa. At 76, and despite regular jogging, Carter's back is a little stooped, but the broad smile still switches on and off like a light. In angry moods, its sudden disappearance becomes a weapon. He is more relaxed and comfortable than he was in the White House, like a man who knows he has accomplished much and finally achieved recognition. But the pain of his 1980 defeat still hurts. He expected to win a second term. \"I was embarrassed to have lost. I was distressed because I felt Reagan was not qualified temperamentally or philosophically to be president. Being defeated as an incumbent is an extreme disappointment,\" he says. Carter also suffered heavily from 1979's year-long hostage crisis after the American embassy in Iran was blockaded by militant Islamic students. When in 1980 an effort to rescue the US diplomats collapsed after an American helicopter collided with a transport plane in the Iranian desert, killing eight US servicemen, the crisis became a symbol of the \"weakness\" which Reagan claimed was at the heart of the Carter presidency. The irony was that, after 11 years in the Navy from 1943 to 1954, Carter had had a longer military career than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower. He also embarked on the massive increase in the US defence budget which Reagan continued. What was remarkable, however, was that no American soldier was killed by enemy fire throughout Carter's presidency, - a record of non-interventionism matched by none of his successors. In deep depression, Carter and his wife Rosalynn returned to their farm in the tiny town of Plains (population0 600). Like Clinton, who will return to private life heavily in debt, Carter found his peanut-processing warehouse had gone downhill and was close to bankruptcy. But he is a man of many parts. He enjoys fly-fishing, hunting, birdwatching and car pentry, is a fan of Dylan Thomas and writes his own poetry. He picked himself up by laying a tongue-and-groove floor in his attic and liquidating his business. In seclusion, he embarked on his memoirs, \"using the very meticulous diary I had kept as a fetish\". The idea for a conflict resolution centre emerged suddenly. \"We were begging for money for the presidential library and I decided I didn't want to have a sterile place where people would come and look at the records. I woke up one night and thought we could have a place here in a congenial atmosphere, similar to Camp David, where people who were in dispute and didn't want to go to the UN or the US government could come,\" he recalls. Naturally, he started in the Middle East but his first efforts were not very successful. He was invited to Iraq by Saddam Hussein in 1986 but quiet preparations for a role in brokering peace with Iran came to nothing and Carter never went to Baghdad. He did better in Syria, where he opened talks with President Assad, and he started the first overtures to Yasser Arafat. To continue the focus on human rights, Carter decided to add election monitoring to the centre's work. He set up a Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government, including several Latin American presidents, to focus on democracy in the hemisphere. The breakthrough, which brought him a kind of rehabilitation in the American media after almost a decade in the wilderness, came in General Noriega's Panama in 1989. Carter demanded to be allowed to send observers to the elections, and watched in horror as voting records were changed and falsified in front of him. \"Are you honest or are you thieves?\", he shouted in secondary-school Spanish before calling a press conference to denounce the election. Noriega ordered Carter and his team to leave the country, declared a state of emergency and repudiated the election as null and void. Carter had shown he could be tough as well as tender. His stock in the United States rose again. But President Bush was planning military intervention against Noriega, and Carter put all his energy into trying to prevent it, hoping that a mediator, backed by powerful political pressure, could persuade Noriega to go into exile. The effort failed and US troops invaded Panama. Carter's stand persuaded Nicaragua's Sandinista president Daniel Ortega to permit a team from the Carter Center to advise him on organising new election rules. Ortega hoped a fair poll would persuade the US to end its armed support for the Contra rebels. On election night, when shock results showed the Sandinistas were losing, Carter and his wife rushed to Ortega's headquarters to prevent any recourse to force. \"I've won an election, Daniel. I've lost an election. I can tell you from my own experience that losing is not the end of the world\", he declared. The arrival in Washington of a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, should have made Carter's life easier, but it had the opposite effect. \"Personally I have always gotten on well with Clinton but he has deliberately frozen out, whenever possible, the involvement of the Carter Center in arenas where I was convinced we could help\", Carter says bitterly. \"I have been to see Clinton about this personally several times. The cause for his attitude I have never understood\". Carter and Clinton could hardly be more different in their private lives. Although Carter once courted ridicule with a remark to Playboy magazine that he occasionally lusted after women \"in my heart\", he has been faithful to his wife for 54 years. Rosalynn travels with him on almost all his foreign trips, and has developed several mental health programmes at the Carter Center. Though none of their four children has followed in Carter's footsteps, either as farmers, naval officers, or politicians, they remain a close family. His youngest child, Amy, was a student radical and was briefly arrested for protesting against CIA recruiting on college campuses. Now married and the mother of a small child, she and her husband live in Atlanta, close to the centre. Carter first exhibited his negotiating skills at Camp David in 1978 with Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin. He still uses one of the techniques he developed there. He studies the subject thoroughly, tries to project himself into each protagonist's position, and then draws up \"what I think is a reasonable final solution before I even see the parties. Then I use that single document and make sure both sides know I use the same document so that there is no distrust of me\". Then he shuttles between them, trying to narrow the gap. He contrasts this technique with Henry Kissinger's. \"I don't think he would disagree. He tells one side one thing, and the other something else, and then keeps them apart as he talks\", Carter says. The key negotiating quality may be what Peter Bourne, a British doctor and longtime friend who worked in Carter's administration, describes as \"his capacity to put aside any moral judgement about people. It goes back to his Baptist background - there is no such thing as bad people, only bad actions.\" One of Carter's most successful missions was his trip to North Korea in 1994. He found himself quickly at ease with Kim Il Sung, the Communist leader of the world's most isolated state. \"He was 82, but extremely knowledgeable about everything in North Korea. He was congenial and very grateful that I had come. He went out of his way to let me know he had a deep appreciation for Christianity. He claimed Christian missionaries may have saved his life when he was imprisoned during the Japanese wartime occupation\", Carter remembers. Kim Il Sung authorised Carter to invite the president of South Korea to a summit meeting. But three weeks later the dictator died and it took his son, Kim Jong Il, six years to repeat the historic gesture and welcome South Korea's president to Pyongyang. Carter acknowledges that he likes to seek out people whom no official American will touch, though he gently deflects the idea that he enjoys supping with the devil to see what he is like. \"It is intriguing to meet Mobutu, Cedras (the former dictator of Haiti), and Kim Il Sung\", he smiles. \"They are pariahs, but my knowledge is that they are the key to the problem and without them no progress is possible\". Other leaders he meets are only pariahs in the US view. Carter wants to \"de-demonise\" them. The Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez was in Atlanta last month (without going to Washington). He admired Carter's willingness, when he was president, to court rightwing anger and prepare the treaties under which the Panama Canal was handed back. Cynics sometimes say Carter is the \"soft cop\" who can do the delicate work which the \"tough cop\" in Washington cannot. But his fierce independence and Clinton's manifest hostility and nervousness about the ex-president's role make that impossible. So is the Carter Center just a way of continuing his presidency and having the second White House term which fate denied him? Andrew Young vigorously denies it. \"I get angry with people who say he's been the greatest ex-president, because this interferes with the effort to understand him as president. He sought to implement an almost theological agenda - world peace, controlling nuclear proliferation, and the reconciliation of race and class. Since then, he has demonstrated, like Martin Luther King and Gandhi, that people who are not office-holders can have a moral impact on society, which is very difficult when you're locked into the checks and balances of a politician in power.\" Young says his main difference with Carter is the ex-president's relative lack of interest in macroeconomics to reduce poverty and inequalities. \"As Martin Luther King said, 'I admire the Good Samaritan but I'm not one myself. I want to change the Jericho road and not just go on picking people up who've been assaulted and robbed'.\" Within the growing community of non-governmental organisations which concentrate on conflict resolution in civil wars and failed Third World states, Carter is admired as a pioneer of so-called Track Two diplomacy - the effort by private individuals to broker settlements. But he is criticised for not having developed with time and experience. \"There's always been tension between Carter's role and his centre's ability to stand alone without him. He doesn't consult. He makes rash decisions,\" says the head of one London-based NGO. \"He's given an extra twist to the elder-statesman role and been good at high profile end-game diplomacy. But he has a low threshhold of tolerance for building up a variety of stake-holders and for long-haul activities,\" says Kevin Clements, head of International Alert, which works in the Sudan, one of the Carter Center's main areas. Ben Hoffman, director of the centre's conflict resolution programme, recognises the problem, especially as the staff is actually quite small, - only three full-time people and six interns from nearby Emory University. \"We need to stay involved longer, and do fewer things but hopefully better. We want to go deeper than a diplomatic inter-state perspective. We don't see the centre coming in and just doing elite-level efforts which achieve an agreement and then leave it to other people on the ground to take it on. We want to bridge the two.\" In recent years Carter has cut back his work load and now spends only one week a month in Atlanta. When they are not travelling, he and Rosalynn stay in their single-story ranch-style home in Plains. What the centre will eventually do without him, and his ability to raise funds and get high-level access to world figures, remains a thorny question. A $250m endowment is being built up to ensure the centre's future. Carter doesn't want the conflict resolution programme to become a mere think-tank. Half-a-dozen studies have been commissioned for new models of the centre. They have all foundered on Carter's unwillingness to decide. \"I doubt, and all our top trustee committees also doubt, that we can get one person to take my place. That is the general consensus which I don't challenge - or endorse,\" he says. In retrospect, and particularly in light of this year's bland choice of presidential candidates, it seems extraordinary that this complex man could ever have been elected president. But he emerged on the scene at a rare moment of American introspection. With his rigorous rejection of military intervention in office and since - he opposed the Gulf war and the Nato war on Yugoslavia - he almost sounds like a pacifist, yet as a former naval officer he is inordinately proud that the latest American submarine, bristling with nuclear missiles, has been named the USS Jimmy Carter. At a time when the danger of American unilateralism has never been greater, \"Carter has a sense of multilateralism\", says Robert White, the president of the Center for International Policy in Washington. \"He has a sincere and sophisticated drive to help build a peaceful and orderly world. I don't think his motives are unworthy.\" James Earl Carter Junior Born: October 1 1924, Plains, Georgia. Education: Plains High School; Georgia Southwestern College; US Naval College, Annapolis.

Peel and finely chop the onion. Remove the crusts from the bread and steep the slice in milk. Bash the juniper until fine. Squeeze the bread of any excess milk, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix together thoroughly, seasoning generously. Form the meat into six burgers of a hearty depth, and refrigerate for at least an hour. </p> <p>Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan and pour in some oil. Place the burgers in the pan and fry both sides over a moderate heat until well-browned and crusted, and the inside retains just a blush of red. </p> <p>The best accompaniments would be pickled plums (or a spiced plum chutney), chips and a bun split and fried in the pan in which the burgers cooked. </p> <p><strong> Civet of venison</strong><br> Venerable and grand, this does require some effort, but, most importantly, it's delicious. It puts some contemporary cookery notions to shame. </p> <p><strong> 1.5kg haunch venison</strong> </p> <p>For the marinade <br> <strong> 375ml good red wine </strong> <br><strong> 3 onions, peeled and chopped fine </strong> <br><strong> 3 tbsp cognac </strong> <br> <strong>3 tbsp olive oil </strong> <br><strong> Black pepper</strong> </p> <p>For the braise <br> <strong> 250g very good streaky bacon, in one piece </strong> <br><strong> 3 onions </strong> <br> <strong>1 carrot </strong> <br><strong> 3 cloves garlic </strong> <br><strong> 60g unsalted butter </strong> <br> <strong>24 button onions, peeled</strong> <br> <strong>24 button mushrooms </strong> <br> <strong>2 tbsp flour </strong> <br> <strong>1 sprig fresh thyme </strong> <br> <strong>1 clove </strong> <br> <strong>1 bayleaf </strong> <br> <strong>Sea salt </strong> <br><strong> Meat stock or red wine, if necessary</strong> </p> <p>I prefer my meat cut into much larger pieces than most butchers, who favour smaller chunks, so buy a whole piece and cut it at home. Trim and discard any sinew, then cut the meat into 5cm cubes. Place in a bowl and cover with the wine, onions, cognac, olive oil and 12 grinds of a peppermill. Cover and refrigerate overnight. </p> <p>The next day, an hour or so before warming the pan and setting this mighty braise on its way, drain the meat through a colander and collect all the marinade - the longer you allow the meat to sit and drain, the better. While the meat drips, set to with the vegetables and bacon, peeling, trimming and chopping all into fairly neat, small dice. Tie up the sprig of thyme with string. </p> <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat a thin film of oil, pop in a single layer of meat and some onion, and fry until richly browned all over. Transfer the browned meat to a warm bowl. Repeat until all the meat is done. </p> <p>In a separate pot, fry the peeled button onions in a little butter and sugar until coloured a good mahogany, then do the same with the mushrooms, though this time omitting the sugar. </p> <p>In the meat pot, fry the remaining chopped vegetables and bacon in butter until softened and a dark, rich brown colour. Stir in the flour, reduce the heat and fry until the mixture is restored to its dark hue. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. </p> <p>Add the marinade, little by little, stirring all the while and scraping up any residue attached to the bottom of the pan. Put the meat into the sauce, and add the clove, bayleaf and thyme. Add the mushrooms and onions. </p> <p>If more liquid is required at this stage to keep the meat and vegetables covered, add meat or venison stock, or simply let the wine flow freely (the latter would most definitely be my preferred choice). Season with a little salt, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to the gentlest murmur and cook quietly, well covered, for at least two hours. The meat should be fragile and moist, though still intact. </p> <p>As with all braised dishes, this is best eaten the day after cooking, but it's not obligatory.

      "bodyText": "All recipes serve six. Venison burger An oddity from the Guv'nor, who got the recipe from a great friend. 1.2kg venison, minced 300g belly pork, minced 1 thick slice white bread 30ml milk 1 small onion 1 dssp redcurrant jelly 2 juniper berries A little grated nutmeg Sea salt and pepper If you don't have a mincer at home, ask your butcher to combine the meats for you. Peel and finely chop the onion. Remove the crusts from the bread and steep the slice in milk. Bash the juniper until fine. Squeeze the bread of any excess milk, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix together thoroughly, seasoning generously. Form the meat into six burgers of a hearty depth, and refrigerate for at least an hour. Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan and pour in some oil. Place the burgers in the pan and fry both sides over a moderate heat until well-browned and crusted, and the inside retains just a blush of red. The best accompaniments would be pickled plums (or a spiced plum chutney), chips and a bun split and fried in the pan in which the burgers cooked. Civet of venison Venerable and grand, this does require some effort, but, most importantly, it's delicious. It puts some contemporary cookery notions to shame. 1.5kg haunch venison For the marinade 375ml good red wine 3 onions, peeled and chopped fine 3 tbsp cognac 3 tbsp olive oil Black pepper For the braise 250g very good streaky bacon, in one piece 3 onions 1 carrot 3 cloves garlic 60g unsalted butter 24 button onions, peeled 24 button mushrooms 2 tbsp flour 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 clove 1 bayleaf Sea salt Meat stock or red wine, if necessary I prefer my meat cut into much larger pieces than most butchers, who favour smaller chunks, so buy a whole piece and cut it at home. Trim and discard any sinew, then cut the meat into 5cm cubes. Place in a bowl and cover with the wine, onions, cognac, olive oil and 12 grinds of a peppermill. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, an hour or so before warming the pan and setting this mighty braise on its way, drain the meat through a colander and collect all the marinade - the longer you allow the meat to sit and drain, the better. While the meat drips, set to with the vegetables and bacon, peeling, trimming and chopping all into fairly neat, small dice. Tie up the sprig of thyme with string. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat a thin film of oil, pop in a single layer of meat and some onion, and fry until richly browned all over. Transfer the browned meat to a warm bowl. Repeat until all the meat is done. In a separate pot, fry the peeled button onions in a little butter and sugar until coloured a good mahogany, then do the same with the mushrooms, though this time omitting the sugar. In the meat pot, fry the remaining chopped vegetables and bacon in butter until softened and a dark, rich brown colour. Stir in the flour, reduce the heat and fry until the mixture is restored to its dark hue. Stir frequently to prevent scorching. Add the marinade, little by little, stirring all the while and scraping up any residue attached to the bottom of the pan. Put the meat into the sauce, and add the clove, bayleaf and thyme. Add the mushrooms and onions. If more liquid is required at this stage to keep the meat and vegetables covered, add meat or venison stock, or simply let the wine flow freely (the latter would most definitely be my preferred choice). Season with a little salt, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to the gentlest murmur and cook quietly, well covered, for at least two hours. The meat should be fragile and moist, though still intact. As with all braised dishes, this is best eaten the day after cooking, but it's not obligatory. Serve straight from the pot with celeriac and potato mash and plenty of noble red wine. Venison stewed in red wine A considerably simpler affair, but just as satisfying. Elizabeth David always conjures up magic from simplicity, and this is her recipe. 1kg flank or shoulder venison 4 tbsp port 4 tbsp good red-wine vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil 4-5 onions, peeled and sliced thin 9 thin rashers streaky bacon Sea salt and pepper Roll the meat into a sausage shape, secure with string, and place in a glazed earthenware or china bowl. Tip in the port, vinegar and olive oil. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0C/300\u00b0F/gas mark 2. Remove the meat from the marinade, wipe it dry, roll it in flour, and place it in a small, oval, earthenware dish in which it will just about fit.

The companies will pay the cost of the operations. </p> <p>Women who have experienced complications such as infection or scarring will be entitled to more. Unusually, the scheme will be open-ended so women who develop serious illnesses can come back for more compensation later. </p> <p>Around 5,000 women in the UK have the implants. They were withdrawn from sale in March amid fears that they could produce a toxic reaction if they leaked. </p> <p>In June, the government advised women to have the implants removed as a precautionary measure after the Department of Health received dozens of reports of \"adverse incidents\". </p> <p>Some women suffered pain and discomfort and experts warned that if they leaked, the implants could cause cancer. </p> <p>Women threatened to sue LipoMatrix Inc, manufacturers of the implants, and AEI Inc, their distributors. But lawyers representing more than 2,000 women and the two companies have thrashed out a compensation package which will avoid the need for the cases to go to court. </p> <p>All women who had their implants removed after the government's medical devices agency (MDA) made its recommendation in June will receive compensation, regardless of whether they have suffered health problems. </p> <p>Soya oil implants were marketed as a safer alternative to silicone. Now many of the women having their Trilucents removed following the government's advice are replacing them with silicone implants. </p> <p>Experts for the MDA said that substances produced by the breakdown of soya oil in the body could damage molecules such as DNA and even cause cancer. </p> <p>Paul Balen, a solicitor representing 2,000 of the women, said: \"The companies responsible for the supply of Trilucent implants have agreed to set up a scheme which will ensure that women receive fair compensation as quickly as possible without having to go to court and in some cases without having to produce any evidence at all.\" The first payouts could be made as early as January 2001. </p> <p>Paul Llewellyn, the solicitor representing LipoMatrix Inc and AEI Inc, said in a statement that neither company admitted liability or any defect in the product. </p> <p>To participate in the compensation scheme, a woman had to show only that she had Trilucent implants removed after June 6 2000 in reliance on the MDA's notice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of women who were told by the government to have their breast implants removed amid fears that they could cause cancer or reproductive problems are to receive compensation from a multi-million pound scheme set up by the manufacturers and suppliers. Women who have suffered no ill effects, but were forced to have their soya oil-filled Trilucent implants taken out, will receive from \u00a35,250 to \u00a38,750 plus any expenses over \u00a3500, depending on whether they have new implants inserted. The companies will pay the cost of the operations. Women who have experienced complications such as infection or scarring will be entitled to more. Unusually, the scheme will be open-ended so women who develop serious illnesses can come back for more compensation later. Around 5,000 women in the UK have the implants. They were withdrawn from sale in March amid fears that they could produce a toxic reaction if they leaked. In June, the government advised women to have the implants removed as a precautionary measure after the Department of Health received dozens of reports of \"adverse incidents\". Some women suffered pain and discomfort and experts warned that if they leaked, the implants could cause cancer. Women threatened to sue LipoMatrix Inc, manufacturers of the implants, and AEI Inc, their distributors. But lawyers representing more than 2,000 women and the two companies have thrashed out a compensation package which will avoid the need for the cases to go to court. All women who had their implants removed after the government's medical devices agency (MDA) made its recommendation in June will receive compensation, regardless of whether they have suffered health problems. Soya oil implants were marketed as a safer alternative to silicone. Now many of the women having their Trilucents removed following the government's advice are replacing them with silicone implants. Experts for the MDA said that substances produced by the breakdown of soya oil in the body could damage molecules such as DNA and even cause cancer. Paul Balen, a solicitor representing 2,000 of the women, said: \"The companies responsible for the supply of Trilucent implants have agreed to set up a scheme which will ensure that women receive fair compensation as quickly as possible without having to go to court and in some cases without having to produce any evidence at all.\" The first payouts could be made as early as January 2001. Paul Llewellyn, the solicitor representing LipoMatrix Inc and AEI Inc, said in a statement that neither company admitted liability or any defect in the product. To participate in the compensation scheme, a woman had to show only that she had Trilucent implants removed after June 6 2000 in reliance on the MDA's notice.",

For the moment the two great survivors of the first century of cinema are those outsized talents and self-promoters, Hitchcock and Welles. (Message to posterity: direct fat.) Welles was a born show-off and risky business, though vindicated by Citizen Kane drearily topping every critics' poll going; Hitchcock, the more calculating, made himself into a public figure to sell his films, and his besuited act of portly Englishman in Hollywood was perfomance art years ahead of Gilbert and George. Hitchcock also understood and worked the Hollywood system in a way that Welles never managed. </p> <p>Both men retained a childish awe for the power of cinema - echoed in Welles's remark about film-making being the best train set a boy could have - which still holds sway through the influence of directors like Spielberg, as opposed to the notion of film being, say, an instrument for political change. Yet, for all its intricacy and power, there often remains something arrested about much of Hitchcock's work, and it's worth pointing out that he was over 60 when he made what was essentially a youth movie, Psycho. </p> <p>Hitchcock's present reputation is partly attributable to the current super-domination of American mainstream cinema, which still feeds off the type of film he pioneered, and, particularly, to Psycho, which laid down the template for the modern horror film. He was also a critic's dream in terms of personal content in a commercial context, subtext, and longevity. The career stretched back to early cinema (\"Silents are a dead duck, Mickey,\" to Michael Powell), and later involved his successful export from England to Hollywood. A Catholic background - always a useful critical feed - allowed the films, like Greene's novels, to be read as essays in transgression and guilt. </p> <p> Hitchcock provided a signature to his films (with his famous cameos) long before critics began cataloguing cinema by director; at the same time he was canny enough not to make intellectual claims for his work, preferring to see it as practical. His preoccupations - the business of suspense and the art of murder - remained constant, allowing for easy critical cross-referencing. The requirements of suspense meant that he was more concerned with the manipulation of assembly and structure than other directors. The films were famous for being premeditated down to the final angle, making the routine of shooting a chore and, just as famously, turning actors into cattle. Any modern screenwriting manual or class is a neurotic extension of Hitchcock's method, endlessly fussing over structural formulae. </p> <p>As a promoter, Hitchcock was a consummate marketer, and his career can be offered as a model for contemporary analysis in terms of product and brand-identity. He also conforms to today's ideal of the artist: private vision harnessed to and rewarded by commercial success. The final cherry for the critic is, as David Thomson has noted, that Hitchcock's films \"are deeply expressive of the way we watch and respond to stories. Their greatness is often employed to explain the nature and workings of cinema. Thus Hitchcock became a way of defining film, a man exclusively intent on the moving image and the compulsive emotions of the spectator.\" </p> <p>The battle for Hitchcock's reputation was won long ago. The French New Wave, particularly Truffaut, who published a long interview in book form, and English Leavisites rallied to the cause in the 1960s, and film writers like Raymond Durgnat and Charles Barr, as well as Thomson, have written authoritatively and well on Hitchcock. Studio paraphernalia, scripts, memos, letters, tabloid-style expos\u00e9s of Hitchcock's sadism towards actresses and decline in old age have all contributed to what has become an oversubscribed area. </p> <p>Now we have the Faberisation of Hitchcock, and it's difficult to know what to make of it. A respected critic is asked to be both fan - a Hitchcock obsessive even, who confesses \"a covert intimacy\" - and respectable academic who can work his way round the subject without confining himself to the ghetto of film studies. Little reference is made to other film writing, with the exception of Truffaut, which is quoting Hitchcock anyway. Conrad also sideswipes modern film theory, which is understandable as his initial connection to Hitchcock was subjective and entirely to do with the forbidden impulse. </p> <p>Conrad's obsession began at 13 in Tasmania, when he cut school and illegally sneaked in to watch an afternoon screening of Psycho; there \"he lost his virginity\". He also became infected. Much of his argument is to do with the notion of cinema as a coded form of sexual repository. Hitchcock, a repressed man, was more than aware of this. His films are littered with double entendres and visual sexual puns; in private he was given to smut, and sent tapes to Prince Rainier, for his eyes only. The body of work can be seen as the apotheosis of a censored cinema - being about what can't be shown (and what you can get away with) - and part of the young Conrad's bewilderment on seeing Psycho was that he was allowed to see as much as he did. The cleverness of the film, he knows now, is that it is the eye of the beholder that makes what is seen explicit. </p> <p>Nevertheless, his account of his initiation is not particularly compelling, with a fudged Oedipal gag for its punchline (Conrad surprised in the shower by father brandishing carrots). From the academic angle, he is keen to enlist Hitchcock into the ranks of the Surrealists because of Hitchcock's understanding of film as an anxious form of dream state, but this argument could be extended to many other film-makers. Cinema has always been a form of reproduction (projection) and dissection (cutting) and Hitchcock's cinema reflected that more than most, peopled as it was with fretful ghosts (actors forbidden to improvise) inhabiting a landscape of sexual ambiguity and innuendo. Given this, it is not hard to find material to support a theory of cinema as 1) wet dream, 2) a form of death, and 3) both, with murder as its extension. </p> <p> The Hitchcock Murders amounts to assiduous use of the VCR and impressive thematic cross-cutting between films, and occasionally the work of directors like Fritz Lang whose career ran parallel to Hitchcock's, and who was in many ways the more interesting film-maker. Curiously, for all its intellectual weight (Conrad is an Oxford professor of English), what the book doesn't do is encourage a re-viewing of the films, remaining firmly grounded and text-bound, at its best when dealing with text, particularly literary sources. Hitchcock had an eye for writers who adapted well to the screen - many now nearly forgotten, including Patrick Hamilton, Thomas Boileau and Pierre Narcejac, and Jack Trevor Story, as well as some whose reputations have held, like Daphne Du Maurier and Patricia Highsmith. Comparisons between film and source make for interesting reading, mainly for what Hitchcock left out. Many of the works drawn from included expressions of wartime or post-nuclear anxieties (even The Birds), which he was careful to cut. The overt message, it seemed, got buried with the body.</p>",

A career as a barrister or solicitor is far removed from the world of TV programmes such as Alley McBeal, LA Law or North Square, and caseloads don't come in racey 60-minute parcels. </p> <p>But among the hundreds of law firms vying for law graduates is innovative practitioner S J Berwin &amp; Co which has just picked up a Law Firm of the Year award. The judges singled out its unusual style, recruitment procedures, and culture of success. </p> <p>With offices in London, Brussels, Frankfurt and Madrid, the firm is active in the emerging markets and international trade arenas. Established in 1982, the firm's objective is to provide \"outstanding legal advice in a dynamic environment\". Unhampered by the bureaucratic attitudes that hold back many older firms, it operates an open and fast-moving atmosphere that promotes progressive thinking and a creative approach to meeting its clients' needs. </p> <p>As a relatively young firm with around 650 employees, it has grown up with a healthy disregard for petty formalities and rigid rules. For example, unlike at its more stuffy rivals, there are no separate dining rooms for partners and all employees are on first name terms.

A career as a barrister or solicitor is far removed from the world of TV programmes such as Alley McBeal, LA Law or North Square, and caseloads don't come in racey 60-minute parcels. But among the hundreds of law firms vying for law graduates is innovative practitioner S J Berwin &amp; Co which has just picked up a Law Firm of the Year award. The judges singled out its unusual style, recruitment procedures, and culture of success. With offices in London, Brussels, Frankfurt and Madrid, the firm is active in the emerging markets and international trade arenas. Established in 1982, the firm's objective is to provide \"outstanding legal advice in a dynamic environment\". Unhampered by the bureaucratic attitudes that hold back many older firms, it operates an open and fast-moving atmosphere that promotes progressive thinking and a creative approach to meeting its clients' needs. As a relatively young firm with around 650 employees, it has grown up with a healthy disregard for petty formalities and rigid rules. For example, unlike at its more stuffy rivals, there are no separate dining rooms for partners and all employees are on first name terms. It also promotes diversity, specifically looking for trainees who come from a wide variety of backgrounds, subject areas, careers and attitudes. Its trainees do share some common attributes though - they are bright, commercially-aware and ambitious. New recruits receive both 'hands on' and 'hands off' training, working with either a senior assistant or a partner. There are appraisals every three months when they can discuss their ambitions and the particular area they wish to pursue through the firm. The firm says its aim is to train all of its lawyers to be outstanding - not only in their chosen specialisation but in their knowledge of the wider areas of law and commerce. Many of its trainees join the firm via a Summer Vacation Scheme whereby students are placed with various departments and earn around \u00a3225 per week. The firm keeps tabs on each trainee who has travelled through the scheme, inviting them all to regular lunches and evening get-togethers. The current starting salary for trainees is around \u00a325,000 plus a maintenance grant of up to \u00a34,500. Salaries for newly-qualifieds start at around \u00a342,000.

It is worth taking half an hour to go through everything you have to do and prioritise each task - it will save you time and anxiety in the long run.\" </p> <p>\"I do have a system,\" says Katherine. \"Basically I separate stuff into piles - 'urgent', 'top priority', 'desperate' and 'should have been done yesterday'. It might sound funny, but it does actually work for me. It gives a structure to what I feel I have to do. I also tend to make phone calls in batches.

I have sworn not to do it again - it makes me resentful about my job, short- tempered with everyone else and in the end I don't think I produce my best work.\" </p> <p>This is the irony; if you never get away from the office your standard and level of work invariably becomes worse rather than better. One way to try and combat the feeling that work is taking over your life is to keep up some kind of activity outside the workplace. </p> <p> \"Everybody needs a break from their work and if you come home and collapse in front of the TV it's probable that you're still thinking about your job,\" believes Professor Cary Cooper. \"If you do something completely different - join a football team, go to a pottery class, make a cake, anything - then it allows you to shake off the working day.\" </p> <p>It's easy to dismiss the idea of doing something after work because you're too exhausted - but any level of activity can clear your mind. \"I couldn't do a night class or anything after work,\" says Stephen Symonds. \"But I do ride a motorbike, and I've started to tinker around it with in the evenings. </p> <p>\"It means I get out of my workclothes and am doing something that has nothing to do with computers. If I've had a really long, busy day then I go out for a ride, tear up and down a few quiet country roads and come back feeling loads better.\" </p> <p>The most important thing is to retain a feeling of control, both in the office and out of it and to avoid being affected by how others are behaving. </p> <p>\"Establish your own rhythm,\" says Charles Kay, \"and don't be swayed by other people.

If you've achieved your objectives for the day then don't feel guilty about leaving on time - it's about how you work, not how long.\" </p> <p> If you don't remember anything else... </p> <p>When things get hectic stay calm.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Japanese nationalists gather today to mark the 30th anniversary of the ritual suicide of the country's most famous postwar novelist, Yukio Mishima, whose extremist views - dismissed as crackpot at the time - are increasingly common currency in the political establishment.</p> <p>After a failed coup attempt at Japan's military headquarters on November 25, 1970 Mishima, the homosexual author of Forbidden Colours, sliced open his belly with a sword and then ordered his followers to decapitate him.</p> <p>This act of seppuku - the ritual suicide of a samurai warrior - did not go to plan. Mishima failed to disembowel himself cleanly and his cohort's hands were shaking so much that he could not chop off his master's head in one blow. The author, who had been tipped for a Nobel prize, died an agonising death.</p> <p>According to the media and politicians of the time, the suicide was also pointless: at best, an artistic performance by a showman and, at worst, a futile gesture by a deranged extremist.</p> <p>Today, however, Mishima's supporters say this ultimate act of self-sacrifice is at last being proved to be an important political milestone because many of the ideas that drove him to such a violent end are starting to enter the mainstream of public debate in Japan.</p> <p>\"Rightwing politicians distanced themselves from Mishima after his suicide by saying it was the act of a madman, but in certain nationalist circles he is held up as a god,\" said Henry Scott-Stokes, the author of a biography of Mishima. \"He showed sincerity in a way that cannot be denied. He stuck a knife into the heart of today's Japan.\"</p> <p>Mishima was a hardcore nationalist, who wanted to restore the divinity of the emperor, strengthen Japan's army and discard the country's pacifist constitution. He felt western values were invading and weakening Japan like a cancer.</p> <p>In his final years, he formed a personal militia that won support from senior politicians in the conservative Liberal Democratic party and he was allowed to train with the army.</p> <p>On the day of his suicide, Mishima made an impassioned speech to army troops, calling on them to rise up and \"restore the emperor\". As his suicide notes later revealed, he expected to fail, but hoped that his seppuku would transform Japan.</p> <p>The mixture of shock and derision that this act provoked in 1970 has long since faded. Today, most young Japanese have little or no interest in Mishima or his novels, but politicians are recycling many of his ideas.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, caused an outcry when he described Japan as \"a nation of gods centring on the emperor\". Moves are under way to upgrade the defence establishment and parliament has begun debate on revising the constitution - a subject that was taboo until last year.</p> <p>\"People used to treat Mishima like a monster who was totally out of touch with reality.

      "bodyText": "Japanese nationalists gather today to mark the 30th anniversary of the ritual suicide of the country's most famous postwar novelist, Yukio Mishima, whose extremist views - dismissed as crackpot at the time - are increasingly common currency in the political establishment. After a failed coup attempt at Japan's military headquarters on November 25, 1970 Mishima, the homosexual author of Forbidden Colours, sliced open his belly with a sword and then ordered his followers to decapitate him. This act of seppuku - the ritual suicide of a samurai warrior - did not go to plan. Mishima failed to disembowel himself cleanly and his cohort's hands were shaking so much that he could not chop off his master's head in one blow. The author, who had been tipped for a Nobel prize, died an agonising death. According to the media and politicians of the time, the suicide was also pointless: at best, an artistic performance by a showman and, at worst, a futile gesture by a deranged extremist. Today, however, Mishima's supporters say this ultimate act of self-sacrifice is at last being proved to be an important political milestone because many of the ideas that drove him to such a violent end are starting to enter the mainstream of public debate in Japan. \"Rightwing politicians distanced themselves from Mishima after his suicide by saying it was the act of a madman, but in certain nationalist circles he is held up as a god,\" said Henry Scott-Stokes, the author of a biography of Mishima. \"He showed sincerity in a way that cannot be denied. He stuck a knife into the heart of today's Japan.\" Mishima was a hardcore nationalist, who wanted to restore the divinity of the emperor, strengthen Japan's army and discard the country's pacifist constitution. He felt western values were invading and weakening Japan like a cancer. In his final years, he formed a personal militia that won support from senior politicians in the conservative Liberal Democratic party and he was allowed to train with the army. On the day of his suicide, Mishima made an impassioned speech to army troops, calling on them to rise up and \"restore the emperor\". As his suicide notes later revealed, he expected to fail, but hoped that his seppuku would transform Japan. The mixture of shock and derision that this act provoked in 1970 has long since faded. Today, most young Japanese have little or no interest in Mishima or his novels, but politicians are recycling many of his ideas. Earlier this year, the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, caused an outcry when he described Japan as \"a nation of gods centring on the emperor\". Moves are under way to upgrade the defence establishment and parliament has begun debate on revising the constitution - a subject that was taboo until last year. \"People used to treat Mishima like a monster who was totally out of touch with reality. But since the end of the cold war, there is a growing movement to recapture our national spirit - in education, in the military, in constitutional debate,\" said Jushu Miura, one of the organisers of today's memorial service. \"It is just as he foresaw. All the points that Mishima raised with his suicide 30 years ago are starting to be discussed.\" The event is expected to attract about 1,000 people. The fairly small size of the crowd is an indication that Mishima, the man, remains a fringe figure. \"I guess he was ahead of his time in terms of his beliefs,\" said a young member of the defence agency, who declined to give his name. \"But the act of ritual suicide is very hard to understand for someone of my generation.\" Others who knew Mishima said the political significance of his action was only now starting to be appreciated.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>How can a defender, particularly one like Rio Ferdinand, who is yet to secure a regular international place, be worth \u00a318m? </p> <p>One might as well ask how a Picasso or a Van Gogh can be sold for that sort of money. Originality is priceless in any form of art and, as a young master of football's defensive artistry, it should not be surprising that Ferdinand has expanded the limits of the marketplace. </p> <p>His ability on the ball, almost unique for an Englishman, so dominates the eye that the West Ham manager Harry Redknapp, who nurtured him to the peak of his talent and selling power, feels it necessary to point out Ferdinand's ability to do the basics of his job. </p> <p>Redknapp says: \"People forget that he is a good defender as well. One on one, I've never seen anyone as good as him. He's almost impossible to beat. People dig him up when he makes a mistake but he makes mistakes because of over-confidence on the ball. If you want someone who runs from the back, it's a high-risk game.\" </p> <p>Paying \u00a318m may seem an even higher risk strategy by Leeds United when football's transfer system could reduce Ferdinand's value to nothing in a month's time and in an industry when one mistimed tackle can end the brightest career. But should the Leicester manager Peter Taylor ever get someone as rich as Richard Desmond, the media magnate who this week bought Express newspapers, as a chairman, he would have no hesitation going that far down the financial road for Rio. </p> <p>Taylor swiftly elevated Ferdinand to the England Under-21 team after first seeing him in the Under-18s three years ago. And, when he took over as England's caretaker manager for the game in Italy last week and began scribbling formations on scraps of paper, the first name he inked in was that of Ferdinand. </p> <p>Taylor says: \"I always had it in my mind to play him in the centre of a back three. But because of his versatility, his ability to run the ball out of defence or pass it out, I would have had no hesitation playing him in a four either. He is also happy to play the ball in tight areas, which inevitably leads to mistakes, but you can't have it both ways. The odd error goes with the sort of player he is.\" </p> <p>Taylor believes that Ferdinand might already have been a fixture in the England team if Glenn Hoddle was still the manager. And many of the most experienced observers believe he will be from now on. </p> <p>Marcello Lippi, one of Italy's most respected coaches, described Ferdinand's performance last week as \"buonissimo\", adding: \"I was surprised by the way England played. Ferdinand looks as though he could be the best of a fine young crop of English footballers.\" </p> <p>Ferdinand always seemed destined to move to Italy, where Juventus and Roma have both been intrigued by his skills which mirror those of their own defenders, rather than the block-and-tackle brigade in England. The team from the capital in fact have a dossier on him that is so detailed it would not have failed to impress J Edgar Hoover. It includes question marks about his \"professionalism\", a euphemistic way of suggesting he should control the drunken antics which have seen him featured on the front page of the News Of The World, although this is more than balanced by his praiseworthy characteristics. </p> <p>Franco Baldini, Roma's transfer market advisor, says: \"We have been keeping tabs on Rio for three years. I see him as a player with tremendous physical gifts and, though he is not muscularly developed, he has the wiry strength that allows him to be powerful, while retaining quickness and flexibility. </p> <p>\"His timing is good but inconsistent, which is an area he can improve upon. But technically he is very good and, unusually for a British defender, he is comfortable on the ball and thinks positively, always trying to find an open team-mate.\" </p> <p>Because he chose to join West Ham as a 15-year-old, it was inevitable that, as a ball-playing defender, Ferdinand would be compared with Bobby Moore, though he finds the compliment embarrassing, saying: \"I never even met Bobby but he was a legend, a one-off.\" </p> <p>Redknapp, who played alongside Moore, believes a more fitting comparison would be between Ferdinand and Franz Beckenbauer. \"When you look at the Germans, they have always had a player who attacks from the back - Beckenbauer, Sammer and Matth\u00e4us,\" he says. \"Rio is what English football has been crying out for and he ought to be an England regular. </p> <p>\"Of course he is going to take chances on the field and once in every 10 games he will drop a clanger. But give me that any time rather than whacking the ball 40 yards upfield like a lot of central defenders have been doing for years.\" </p> <p>Even in his salad days as a defender for Blackheath Bluecoat school Ferdinand stood out as a player who was exceptionally composed on the ball. His former PE master Andy Whomsley says: \"We were lucky to have a lot of players almost as good as him. But he was always the one who was going to make it because he was so committed and so competitive.\" </p> <p>West Ham's Paolo di Canio would agree. Despite the abridged comments from his autobiography which appeared to suggest that Ferdinand was not yet ready for international football, he remains a committed fan. \"He is one of the most intelligent footballers I have met,\" says Di Canio. \"I would say that he is currently at a level just below Paolo Maldini but he has the ability to be better than Alessandro Nesta, whom I rate the best defender in the world.\" </p> <p>Selling such a player was as unthinkable to West Ham's fans as selling Moore would have been. But by continually denying that he would sell Redknapp forced the price up to a level which has deflected any possible criticism from Hammers supporters. It is impossible to voice criticism with a hanging jaw, which was the reaction not just of West Ham's fans but everyone else when the fee was confirmed. </p> <p>Redknapp knew it was an offer he simply could not refuse. He says: \"I wish I had another three Rios to put in my back three and the chairman would be delighted. He would be able to build a new stand.\" </p> <p>The Leeds captain Lucas Radebe has won the Fifa Fair Play Award for 2000 for his work with children in his home country and also for his commitment to the fight against racism in football. He will be presented with the award at a Fifa gala in Rome on December 11. Meanwhile, Portugal's Luis Figo, the Brazilian Rivaldo and France's Zinedine Zidane have been confirmed as the three nominees for the World Player of the Year award.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How can a defender, particularly one like Rio Ferdinand, who is yet to secure a regular international place, be worth \u00a318m? One might as well ask how a Picasso or a Van Gogh can be sold for that sort of money. Originality is priceless in any form of art and, as a young master of football's defensive artistry, it should not be surprising that Ferdinand has expanded the limits of the marketplace. His ability on the ball, almost unique for an Englishman, so dominates the eye that the West Ham manager Harry Redknapp, who nurtured him to the peak of his talent and selling power, feels it necessary to point out Ferdinand's ability to do the basics of his job. Redknapp says: \"People forget that he is a good defender as well. One on one, I've never seen anyone as good as him. He's almost impossible to beat. People dig him up when he makes a mistake but he makes mistakes because of over-confidence on the ball. If you want someone who runs from the back, it's a high-risk game.\" Paying \u00a318m may seem an even higher risk strategy by Leeds United when football's transfer system could reduce Ferdinand's value to nothing in a month's time and in an industry when one mistimed tackle can end the brightest career. But should the Leicester manager Peter Taylor ever get someone as rich as Richard Desmond, the media magnate who this week bought Express newspapers, as a chairman, he would have no hesitation going that far down the financial road for Rio. Taylor swiftly elevated Ferdinand to the England Under-21 team after first seeing him in the Under-18s three years ago. And, when he took over as England's caretaker manager for the game in Italy last week and began scribbling formations on scraps of paper, the first name he inked in was that of Ferdinand. Taylor says: \"I always had it in my mind to play him in the centre of a back three. But because of his versatility, his ability to run the ball out of defence or pass it out, I would have had no hesitation playing him in a four either. He is also happy to play the ball in tight areas, which inevitably leads to mistakes, but you can't have it both ways. The odd error goes with the sort of player he is.\" Taylor believes that Ferdinand might already have been a fixture in the England team if Glenn Hoddle was still the manager. And many of the most experienced observers believe he will be from now on. Marcello Lippi, one of Italy's most respected coaches, described Ferdinand's performance last week as \"buonissimo\", adding: \"I was surprised by the way England played. Ferdinand looks as though he could be the best of a fine young crop of English footballers.\" Ferdinand always seemed destined to move to Italy, where Juventus and Roma have both been intrigued by his skills which mirror those of their own defenders, rather than the block-and-tackle brigade in England. The team from the capital in fact have a dossier on him that is so detailed it would not have failed to impress J Edgar Hoover. It includes question marks about his \"professionalism\", a euphemistic way of suggesting he should control the drunken antics which have seen him featured on the front page of the News Of The World, although this is more than balanced by his praiseworthy characteristics. Franco Baldini, Roma's transfer market advisor, says: \"We have been keeping tabs on Rio for three years. I see him as a player with tremendous physical gifts and, though he is not muscularly developed, he has the wiry strength that allows him to be powerful, while retaining quickness and flexibility. \"His timing is good but inconsistent, which is an area he can improve upon. But technically he is very good and, unusually for a British defender, he is comfortable on the ball and thinks positively, always trying to find an open team-mate.\" Because he chose to join West Ham as a 15-year-old, it was inevitable that, as a ball-playing defender, Ferdinand would be compared with Bobby Moore, though he finds the compliment embarrassing, saying: \"I never even met Bobby but he was a legend, a one-off.\" Redknapp, who played alongside Moore, believes a more fitting comparison would be between Ferdinand and Franz Beckenbauer. \"When you look at the Germans, they have always had a player who attacks from the back - Beckenbauer, Sammer and Matth\u00e4us,\" he says. \"Rio is what English football has been crying out for and he ought to be an England regular. \"Of course he is going to take chances on the field and once in every 10 games he will drop a clanger. But give me that any time rather than whacking the ball 40 yards upfield like a lot of central defenders have been doing for years.\" Even in his salad days as a defender for Blackheath Bluecoat school Ferdinand stood out as a player who was exceptionally composed on the ball. His former PE master Andy Whomsley says: \"We were lucky to have a lot of players almost as good as him. But he was always the one who was going to make it because he was so committed and so competitive.\" West Ham's Paolo di Canio would agree. Despite the abridged comments from his autobiography which appeared to suggest that Ferdinand was not yet ready for international football, he remains a committed fan. \"He is one of the most intelligent footballers I have met,\" says Di Canio. \"I would say that he is currently at a level just below Paolo Maldini but he has the ability to be better than Alessandro Nesta, whom I rate the best defender in the world.\" Selling such a player was as unthinkable to West Ham's fans as selling Moore would have been. But by continually denying that he would sell Redknapp forced the price up to a level which has deflected any possible criticism from Hammers supporters. It is impossible to voice criticism with a hanging jaw, which was the reaction not just of West Ham's fans but everyone else when the fee was confirmed. Redknapp knew it was an offer he simply could not refuse. He says: \"I wish I had another three Rios to put in my back three and the chairman would be delighted. He would be able to build a new stand.\" The Leeds captain Lucas Radebe has won the Fifa Fair Play Award for 2000 for his work with children in his home country and also for his commitment to the fight against racism in football. He will be presented with the award at a Fifa gala in Rome on December 11. Meanwhile, Portugal's Luis Figo, the Brazilian Rivaldo and France's Zinedine Zidane have been confirmed as the three nominees for the World Player of the Year award.",

But the idea of a terrible schism lends colour to the tribal banners. </p> <p>David Hodgeson, a taxi driver, is another Celtic supporter who is enjoying the new ascendancy.

The Celtic supporter is desolate, utterly dejected. His Rangers counterpart is pretty glum too, but there is also bewilderment in the blue ranks, indignation and outrage even, as if the natural order of things has been upset. </p> <p>McElroy is still unconvinced: \"Celtic haven't won anything yet.

Old Firm games turn my stomach.\" </p> <p>John Collins described it as the \"ultimate experience\" and Tommy Burns said: \"You're exhilarated and nauseated all in one.\" So are we all.</p>",

Unfortunately this is an attitude not shared by the followers of Rangers or Celtic. \"No, it's still pretty much the same as it ever was,\" says Charles Stewart, a non-Catholic Celtic supporter. \"Old Firm matches generally pass off without too much trouble these days. But the feelings that go with them run just as deep, which is pretty depressing. \"Even the fact that Celtic have often fielded more Protestants than Rangers, and vice versa with all the Italians who have gone to Ibrox, the spit and hatred is still there. And I reckon it will be there for another five generations or so before people start to step back from it.\" Both Tim and Hun would probably struggle to define his personal notion of Christianity. But the idea of a terrible schism lends colour to the tribal banners. David Hodgeson, a taxi driver, is another Celtic supporter who is enjoying the new ascendancy. He says: \"The Old Firm is still a very serious business, as we will see on Sunday when all police leave will be cancelled and there will be hellicopters overhead and a strict crowd segregation. But it's not so bad now as it was in the 50s and 60s. \"My grandfather, apart from being a Celtic supporter, was a great fan of Frank Sinatra. So when Sinatra came to Glasgow he was delighted. But the great man chose to sing at Ibrox. My grandad felt that by going there he would somehow be giving pennies to Rangers. So he got a train to London and saw Sinatra at the Albert Hall. \"The feeling was the same when McEwans sponsored Rangers. Suddenly you heard Celtic supporters saying, 'I wouldn't drink that piss,' and eventually the lager was withdrawn from Celtic pubs.\" They are still finding plenty of beer to drink, it might be added, though their present euphoria does not have that rather unattractive Protestant triumphalism often associated with Rangers' successes. Defeat also brings different reactions. The Celtic supporter is desolate, utterly dejected. His Rangers counterpart is pretty glum too, but there is also bewilderment in the blue ranks, indignation and outrage even, as if the natural order of things has been upset. McElroy is still unconvinced: \"Celtic haven't won anything yet. They are solid and hard to beat but I'm not sure they're a good side.\" In the end, though, the football will count for little tomorrow. \"I know what it's like to be called an Orange bastard and a Fenian bastard even though I've never been religious,\" says the former Celtic defender Jackie McNamara. \"There is real hatred in these people's eyes. Old Firm games turn my stomach.\" John Collins described it as the \"ultimate experience\" and Tommy Burns said: \"You're exhilarated and nauseated all in one.\" So are we all.",

The manager has not lost his finishing class and it seems to be rubbing off on his team. </p> <p>Home wins against Chelsea and Aston Villa and a draw at Sunderland, which followed three straight defeats, have moved Southampton seven points clear of the bottom three and, perhaps relevantly, to within two wins of the top six. </p> <p>The transformation, says Beattie, has been all in the mind. \"We've been working a lot on improving communication and concentration in the side as well as giving us belief in ourselves. If we went a goal down the lads used to think, 'Here we go again', but now we think, 'Let's get back in it'. The mentality has totally changed. </p> <p>\"We've been working on it with the gaffer since the beginning of the season. We all sit down and talk. If someone's not doing something right we'll tell them; it all comes out, no one has any secrets. We meet two or three times a week and the gaffer's got a sports psychologist in who is always here and sees what people get up to. </p> <p>\"He talks to us about positive attitude, believing in yourself and visualising things that have gone right for you, and I think it's helped a lot.\" </p> <p>Upbeat thoughts would have been difficult for Beattie in the summer. After his \u00a31m move from Blackburn in July 1998 he was named player of the year at the Dell in his first season. Last season, though, his chances were ruined by tendon injuries in both ankles. </p> <p>\"I spent my time staring at the ceiling in the medical room and you've just got to think about the good times from the last year and hope you can get back to that. Most of it was resting and I am not the sort of person who can do that for long. I just said to myself, 'I will never go there again'. But you've got to have times like that to appreciate the times I'm having now.\" </p> <p>His luck almost took a further turn for the worse when Crystal Palace made a \u00a32.6m offer for him last month. \"That was close,\" he says. \"I didn't want to go but the chairman accepted the bid. I stuck to my guns and said I wanted to fight for my place.\" </p> <p>Hoddle, and the chairman Rupert Lowe, must be delighted Beattie stood firm. He has taken his chance in style and is something of a lucky charm: Southampton have never lost when he has scored. West Ham would be well advised to keep a close eye on him today.</p>",

Now the finance industry want us to buy hedge funds for our pensions or even as an alternative to an Isa. </p> <p>Recently, Credit Suisse First Boston, a giant investment bank, has been telling British financial advisers that early next year it is to launch the UK's first hedge fund for small investors which will be available as an Individual Savings Account. Goldman Sachs' investment management division is also promoting its expertise in hedge fund investments to major British company and local authority pension funds. At the other end of the scale are small investment boutiques, such as Matrix Securities, which is planning to launch a hedge fund early next year for private UK investors with \u00a310,000. Financial Services Authority rules forbid investment managers from mailing small investors with hedge fund products; all the ones currently in existence are unregulated, unauthorised funds which have no compensation scheme to back them up. They can only be sold to investors with whom companies already have an existing relationship, effectively restricting them to the wealthy clients of private banks. The FSA fears that highly-geared hedge funds pose a systemic risk to the financial system. </p> <p>Credit Suisse First Boston is planning to overcome these UK rules by basing its hedge fund in Dublin which, as it is within the EU, will enable CSFB to sell directly to small UK investors in a similar way to unit trusts and Isas. </p> <p>\"This is a first in many ways for the retail marketplace. It is likely to have a minimum investment of \u00a37,000, which is really bringing it to the smaller investor for the first time.

It means that a \u00a3100m hedge fund usually earns higher fees than that picked up by a \u00a31bn unit trust. But Mr Habib adds: \"Fees will be kept to a minimum and will be very competitive with other traditional products.\" </p> <p>So are hedge funds the equivalent of bungee-jumping with your savings, or can they make up a sensible part of an investment portfolio? Coutts &amp; Co, bankers to the Queen, think they're safe - but only for the rich. Coutts imposes a minimum investment of \u00a3150,000 for anyone wanting to buy one of its hedge funds - and you have to already have a minimum balance of \u00a3500,000 at the bank. But far from promising breathtaking returns, Coutts says its fund-of-hedge-funds is a safe, low volatility path to steady returns of 10-12% a year. </p> <p>Coutts bravely stepped into the hedge fund arena in June 1998, shortly before the LTCM collapse, and has pulled in over \u00a31bn into the funds. It says clients in its low-risk fund have achieved returns of just over 10% per annum, while its medium-risk fund is making 15% a year and its high risk fund (minimum investment: \u00a3250,000) launched recently is already showing over 20% returns a year. Coutts head of investment products Bob Dawkins says: \"We are not suggesting clients use them as an alternative to traditional stockmarket investing. I wouldn't suggest them as the first investment choice for someone with \u00a35-10,000, even if that was available.\" </p> <p>Matrix Securities is already setting tongues wagging with its plan to launch a retail hedge fund for people with \u00a310,000 or more to invest.

Yet the work was written in the heat and light of an Italian autumn - a world away from the dusk and gloom of Sibelius's native Finland. </p> <p>So it was appropriate that the conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, in the Musicians' Benevolent Fund's Royal Concert, should be Antonio Pappano, the Italian incumbent of the music-directorship of the Royal Opera House. For this annual concert, now a 50-year-old institution, all the musicians waive their fees. And the defining feature of the LSO's playing and Pappano's direction was a big-hearted generosity - of emotional range, of orchestral colour, and sheer weight of sound. </p> <p>The performance convincingly negotiated the work's surface drama and structural depth. If Pappano's slow movement was full of contrast - from the doleful chant of the opening woodwind theme to the strings' luxurious phrasing of the long central melody - he never lost sight of the music's essential momentum. And where the oboe song at the heart of the scherzo was vividly languid, Pappano's finale was all power and purpose. Without sacrificing the integrity of Sibelius's unique symphonic design, Pappano revealed that expressive warmth is no less a part of Sibelius's compositional world. </p> <p>In fact, there was more coolness in Sarah Chang's performance of Bruch's First Violin Concerto. There is no doubting Chang's phenomenal technical gifts, nor the matchless projection of her playing. Across the whole range of the instrument Chang's supercharged tone and vibrato slice through any orchestral texture. And she is a vividly gestural performer, articulating the shape of phrases as much with her body as with her bow. Yet Chang's playing lacked the glow of insight or involvement. It was as if the concerto was a series of challenges to be conquered and - albeit brilliantly - displayed.</p>",

What he offers is an account of an abortive double act in 1946 Egypt involving Tommy Cooper and Frankie Lyons that started in good humour and ended in tears. It is also further proof that while post-war troop shows may not have done much for local morale, they are something of a dramatic gold mine. </p> <p>At first I felt the play might be comic history seen from the vantage-point of the vanquished. While Tommy Cooper went on to become a national hero, Frankie Lyons was essentially an amateur vaudevillian who returned to civilian life as a sheet-metal worker. But Lyons's account of his father's fatal pairing with the ambitious, overweening Cooper has the ring of truth. </p> <p>As we see Cooper tearing up his partner's sketches, grumbling over his failings and hogging the limelight, we sense we are in the presence of a restless perfectionist and comic original who resented being teamed up with a genial traditionalist. Cooper emerges as a ruthless egotist. But, while the show sympathises emotionally with the outshone Frankie, it also pays professional tribute to the victorious Tommy. And even if some of the gags are wildly anachronistic - there certainly wouldn't have been ploughman's lunch jokes in 1946 - it's good to be reminded of Cooper's lunar strangeness. </p> <p>We get the fez, the bungled magic and the bad gags: \"I said to the doctor I've broken my arm in several places. He said I shouldn't go to those places.\" </p> <p>But it is the looming physical presence itself that tickles. As George Jean Nathan said, a true comedian is someone who makes you laugh before they've even opened their mouth. You can see why Cooper couldn't work with a partner. His whole comic persona was based on eccentric solitude. </p> <p>Lyons's play brings out the human sadness of the mismatch and gives equal room to both players. Ben Fox as Frankie exudes good-natured insecurity and is very funny in a Chaplinesque boxing sketch where he becomes helplessly embroiled in the ropes. Christopher Brand, asked to play a singular genius, rises above mere impersonation. In particular, he makes good use of a long-distance stare as if other people are simply things in his dream.
