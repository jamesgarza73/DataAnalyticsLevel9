      "bodyText": "Despite the apparently bewildering columns, figures and league tables, the NHS reference costs 2000 report gives a useful - if partial - insight into the comparative efficiency of hospitals and community services in England. The report is billed as \"the most comprehensive coverage of service costs in the public domain of any health service\" and covers 9m episodes of NHS care recorded in 1999-00, equivalent to 60% of NHS expenditure. The league table \"rankings\" are not entirely trustworthy - they are not as transparent an index of performance as, say, a league table of football clubs, and nor do they necessarily reflect clinical quality. Most trusts with high average costs will be able to provide plausible evidence as to why specific local conditions - such as carrying out a high proportion of complex and costly operations - justify their \"low\" cost efficiency. But they do provide a useful benchmark guide to how well trusts that are of a broadly similar size and type, and carry out a broadly similar mix of operations, have succeeded in making services more cost-efficient - meaning providing more care for every pound spent. Take the big London teaching hospitals for example. While costs at St George's Healthcare trust and King's Healthcare trust are respectively 15% and 8% above the NHS average, near neighbours Guys and St Thomas' trust costs is 10% below. Similarly, a successful caesarian section costs \u00a34,385 at Barts and the London NHS trust; the same procedure costs \u00a31,956 a few miles further south at King's Healthcare trust and \u00a31,521 a few minutes drive further west at University College London Hospitals trust. Identification of such variations among what, on the face of it, are similar trusts allows managers to address inefficiencies where it this clinically justified - perhaps developing more efficient ways of working, or reducing the length of time patients spend in hospital. Health minister John Denham says the tables are \"essential to raise standards across the NHS and address the unacceptable variations in performance in a co-ordinated way\". Snapshots from the report include: \u0095 Hip replacements were undertaken in 185 NHS trusts in 1999-00. The average cost of a planned primary hip operation (when a hip is replaced for the first time) was \u00a33,899.

      "body": "<p>There's no doubt who came best out of last night's round of byelections, in Preston, West Bromwich and the Anniesland division of Glasgow, where vacancies had to be filled both for Westminster and for the Scottish parliament. This was a very good night for the Can't Be Bothered party, and a pretty dispiriting moment for anyone else.</p> <p>It is easy to tell the story in terms of Labour majorities slashed: down from 18,680 to 4,426 in Preston; down from 15,154 to 6,337 in the Westminster contest at Anniesland. (You can't make any comparison for West Bromwich, since in May 1997 Betty Boothroyd stood as the Speaker Seeking Re-election and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats did not put up candidates against her).</p> <p>But these aren't the statistics that really matter. The lower the turnouts in byelections, the less figures for majorities and for swing from one side to the other tell you about the real electoral world. And these turnouts were very low: not as abject as at some of the previous byelections in this parliament, but a mere 38% in Scotland, 30% in Lancashire and 28% in the Midlands.</p> <p>In these circumstances it makes sense to look at the figures in a less conventional way, and concentrate less on each party's share of the vote than on the proportion of the electorate which bothered to turn out for each of them. Analysed in this fashion, the story at Preston was this: around 13% of those entitled to vote took the trouble to go to the polling stations and mark their crosses for Labour. Some 7% did the same for the Tories; while 70% stayed at home.</p> <p>In West Bromwich, the figures were very similar: 14% of those entitled to vote gave their support to Labour, 9% turned out for the Tories, 72% stayed away.</p> <p>In Glasgow Anniesland, the figures for the Westminster election show 20% turning out for Labour, 8% for the Scottish National Party and 4% for the Tories, with 62% preferring to do something else. In the election for the Scottish parliament, the SNP did rather better than in the Westminster contest and Labour a little worse, but again the stayaways were the majority tendency at 62%.</p> <p>So these contests were very much a minority preoccupation. In so far as one can detect the mood of the nation it seems to be this. People are not enthusiastic about this government. Of those who voted Labour in May 1997, roughly 70% defected in Preston this time, (a figure which no doubt reflects disputes in the local party over who should be its candidate), roughly 60% in West Bromwich, and just about half in Anniesland.</p> <p>But there is no great enthusiasm either for trying to turn Labour out. In the great byelections of the Thatcher years, which helped engineer her eviction from office 10 years ago this week, what struck terror in Conservative hearts was not just Tory defections but the positive surge in Labour or Lib Dem support. There was little sign of a similar process here. The SNP vote in Anniesland, a seat where these great byelection fighters must have had some hope of making a splash, was down on May 1997. The Tories were no real threat to Labour - even in West Bromwich, where because of the reintroduction of party politics after the Boothroyd years they should have been raring to go.</p> <p>In that context - and especially after the autumn of discontent which shook Labour so badly - Mr Blair today may be feeling a sense of reprieve. On the other hand, when he turns to the morning papers, and the headlines on Europe and beef and petrol prices (once more), he may well have started to feel queasy again.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/elect2000/article/0,2763,402324,00.html\">Clean sweep for Labour in byelection test</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/elect2000/article/0,2763,402331,00.html\">Full results: Anniesland</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/elect2000/article/0,2763,402333,00.html\">Full results: Preston</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/elect2000/article/0,2763,402334,00.html\">Full results: West Bromwich West</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/elect2000/graphic/0,5543,401805,00.html\">Map: where were the elections?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.conservative-party.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Conservative party</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.libdems.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Liberal Democrats </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.snp.org/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Scottish National party</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "There's no doubt who came best out of last night's round of byelections, in Preston, West Bromwich and the Anniesland division of Glasgow, where vacancies had to be filled both for Westminster and for the Scottish parliament. This was a very good night for the Can't Be Bothered party, and a pretty dispiriting moment for anyone else. It is easy to tell the story in terms of Labour majorities slashed: down from 18,680 to 4,426 in Preston; down from 15,154 to 6,337 in the Westminster contest at Anniesland. (You can't make any comparison for West Bromwich, since in May 1997 Betty Boothroyd stood as the Speaker Seeking Re-election and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats did not put up candidates against her). But these aren't the statistics that really matter. The lower the turnouts in byelections, the less figures for majorities and for swing from one side to the other tell you about the real electoral world. And these turnouts were very low: not as abject as at some of the previous byelections in this parliament, but a mere 38% in Scotland, 30% in Lancashire and 28% in the Midlands. In these circumstances it makes sense to look at the figures in a less conventional way, and concentrate less on each party's share of the vote than on the proportion of the electorate which bothered to turn out for each of them. Analysed in this fashion, the story at Preston was this: around 13% of those entitled to vote took the trouble to go to the polling stations and mark their crosses for Labour. Some 7% did the same for the Tories; while 70% stayed at home. In West Bromwich, the figures were very similar: 14% of those entitled to vote gave their support to Labour, 9% turned out for the Tories, 72% stayed away. In Glasgow Anniesland, the figures for the Westminster election show 20% turning out for Labour, 8% for the Scottish National Party and 4% for the Tories, with 62% preferring to do something else. In the election for the Scottish parliament, the SNP did rather better than in the Westminster contest and Labour a little worse, but again the stayaways were the majority tendency at 62%. So these contests were very much a minority preoccupation. In so far as one can detect the mood of the nation it seems to be this. People are not enthusiastic about this government. Of those who voted Labour in May 1997, roughly 70% defected in Preston this time, (a figure which no doubt reflects disputes in the local party over who should be its candidate), roughly 60% in West Bromwich, and just about half in Anniesland. But there is no great enthusiasm either for trying to turn Labour out. In the great byelections of the Thatcher years, which helped engineer her eviction from office 10 years ago this week, what struck terror in Conservative hearts was not just Tory defections but the positive surge in Labour or Lib Dem support. There was little sign of a similar process here. The SNP vote in Anniesland, a seat where these great byelection fighters must have had some hope of making a splash, was down on May 1997. The Tories were no real threat to Labour - even in West Bromwich, where because of the reintroduction of party politics after the Boothroyd years they should have been raring to go. In that context - and especially after the autumn of discontent which shook Labour so badly - Mr Blair today may be feeling a sense of reprieve. On the other hand, when he turns to the morning papers, and the headlines on Europe and beef and petrol prices (once more), he may well have started to feel queasy again.

      "body": "<p>Eminem and the members of Radiohead may have woken up in marginally better moods than usual today after the bad tempered rapper and caricature-like serious rockers collected awards last night for their websites.</p> <p>Eminem, notorious for appalling middle America's parents while he sells records to their teens, won the international artist category and Radiohead picked up the alternative crown in the inaugural British Online Music Awards (Omas).</p> <p>You would be forgiven at this point for wondering what the awards are and, more importantly, what they mean. </p> <p>The Omas were set up by Music Week magazine to highlight \"creativity, innovation and technical wizardry\" in a business better known for its lawsuits against anything of the sort.</p> <p>According to Steve Redmond, Music Week's publisher, there is a \"new music industry developing\", built on \"bits, bytes and the internet\". He claims the Omas are \"the first truly 21st century music awards\". </p> <p>Fittingly Napster, the internet music sharing (or pirating) software, won the online pioneer award. </p> <p>This is significant because Napster is one of the few true movers and shakers in the online music world. In fact it could only exist online. Instead of selling mail order CDs or advertising tour dates it bypassed the massive distribution networks of the multinational music industry, if only for a short time. </p> <p>The industry took Napster to court, unhappy that the promise of free music would eat into its profit margins. The alternative - that exposure to new artists and genres might tempt the listening public into buying more CDs - was never entertained. To avoid paying punitive damages, Napster sold out to the media giant Bertelsmann but its free spirit continues on many imitator P2P (peer to peer) sites.</p> <p>This is where the awards fall down. Arguably, a \"new music industry\" based on the net does not exist. True, there are individual operators, but by no means an industry in the conventional sense. If one is to flourish its chief executives must recognise that the net's strength is its ability to move information around the world quickly. That is all Napster did, the information just happened to be music. </p> <p>It will be a long journey. Radiohead and Eminem's web presence are both what surfers would call \"cool sites\" but not necessarily good music sites. They are, fundamentally, merely pieces of PR: from Radiohead's site we know, for example, that they are serious artists who share a common political ground with anti-capitalist protesters. That may make us want to click on the next link to buy their t-shirts and CDs.</p> <p>As often in the music business, innovation is left to come from the bottom up.

      "bodyText": "Eminem and the members of Radiohead may have woken up in marginally better moods than usual today after the bad tempered rapper and caricature-like serious rockers collected awards last night for their websites. Eminem, notorious for appalling middle America's parents while he sells records to their teens, won the international artist category and Radiohead picked up the alternative crown in the inaugural British Online Music Awards (Omas). You would be forgiven at this point for wondering what the awards are and, more importantly, what they mean. The Omas were set up by Music Week magazine to highlight \"creativity, innovation and technical wizardry\" in a business better known for its lawsuits against anything of the sort. According to Steve Redmond, Music Week's publisher, there is a \"new music industry developing\", built on \"bits, bytes and the internet\". He claims the Omas are \"the first truly 21st century music awards\". Fittingly Napster, the internet music sharing (or pirating) software, won the online pioneer award. This is significant because Napster is one of the few true movers and shakers in the online music world. In fact it could only exist online. Instead of selling mail order CDs or advertising tour dates it bypassed the massive distribution networks of the multinational music industry, if only for a short time. The industry took Napster to court, unhappy that the promise of free music would eat into its profit margins. The alternative - that exposure to new artists and genres might tempt the listening public into buying more CDs - was never entertained. To avoid paying punitive damages, Napster sold out to the media giant Bertelsmann but its free spirit continues on many imitator P2P (peer to peer) sites. This is where the awards fall down. Arguably, a \"new music industry\" based on the net does not exist. True, there are individual operators, but by no means an industry in the conventional sense. If one is to flourish its chief executives must recognise that the net's strength is its ability to move information around the world quickly. That is all Napster did, the information just happened to be music. It will be a long journey. Radiohead and Eminem's web presence are both what surfers would call \"cool sites\" but not necessarily good music sites. They are, fundamentally, merely pieces of PR: from Radiohead's site we know, for example, that they are serious artists who share a common political ground with anti-capitalist protesters. That may make us want to click on the next link to buy their t-shirts and CDs. As often in the music business, innovation is left to come from the bottom up. Napster showed a way for consumers to use the net but the onus now switches to the producers. Dance producers can exchange samples and drums patterns using Napster-style sharing technology and - at the other end of the spectrum - Adam Burrows, guitarist with a Bristol-based band, Big Joan, says that being on a small internet label, Sink and Stove Records, allows him to network with other musicians without, as he puts it, going all out to impress a \"record company's toilet cleaner\" . The net may change the way we create and listen to music. But if it does not, then the industry's \"creativity, innovation and technical wizardry\" online will be wasted.

Union has teamed up with AIM-listed media group West 175, to form Union 175, which will develop, produce, and distribute TV programmes in the UK and worldwide. Bradley Adams, chairman of Union, said his company would provide the creative input in the new venture, which will give it the financial firepower to put more programmes on screen. Union's biggest hits include the long-running MasterChef series and the BBC adaptation of Iain Banks' Crow Road. Johnny Vaughan's comedy-drama, called 'Orrible, will be broadcast on BBC2 at the end of next year. Mr Adams said: \"We have been a successful production company, but a very small one. When you reach a certain critical mass, you tend to just bump along with old ideas. \"This deal gives us the money to recruit more staff and develop more programmes.\" said Mr Adams. The company already has 10 programmes in development, and West 175 will use the deal as a UK launchpad for its smash-hit Dream Home programme. The New Zealand series invites couples to renovate derelict houses, with the best attempt being decided by a viewers' phone poll. West 175, which has production units in the US and New Zealand, will stump up initial development funds of \u00a32m for the new venture. John McEwen, the chief executive of West 175, said: \"We were looking for someone to be our broadcaster in the UK and Union were the perfect fit for us.\" Mr McEwen added that the new venture will not get involved in feature films.

      "body": "<p>There's no doubt who came best out of last night's round of byelections, in Preston, West Bromwich and the Anniesland division of Glasgow, where vacancies had to be filled both for Westminster and for the Scottish parliament. This was a very good night for the Can't Be Bothered party, and a pretty dispiriting moment for anyone else.</p> <p>It is easy to tell the story in terms of Labour majorities slashed: down from 18,680 to 4,426 in Preston; down from 15,154 to 6,337 in the Westminster contest at Anniesland. (You can't make any comparison for West Bromwich, since in May 1997 Betty Boothroyd stood as the Speaker Seeking Re-election and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats did not put up candidates against her).</p> <p>But these aren't the statistics that really matter. The lower the turnouts in byelections, the less figures for majorities and for swing from one side to the other tell you about the real electoral world. And these turnouts were very low: not as abject as at some of the previous byelections in this parliament, but a mere 38% in Scotland, 30% in Lancashire and 28% in the Midlands.</p> <p>In these circumstances it makes sense to look at the figures in a less conventional way, and concentrate less on each party's share of the vote than on the proportion of the electorate which bothered to turn out for each of them. Analysed in this fashion, the story at Preston was this: around 13% of those entitled to vote took the trouble to go to the polling stations and mark their crosses for Labour. Some 7% did the same for the Tories; while 70% stayed at home.</p> <p>In West Bromwich, the figures were very similar: 14% of those entitled to vote gave their support to Labour, 9% turned out for the Tories, 72% stayed away.</p> <p>In Glasgow Anniesland, the figures for the Westminster election show 20% turning out for Labour, 8% for the Scottish National Party and 4% for the Tories, with 62% preferring to do something else. In the election for the Scottish parliament, the SNP did rather better than in the Westminster contest and Labour a little worse, but again the stayaways were the majority tendency at 62%.</p> <p>So these contests were very much a minority preoccupation. In so far as one can detect the mood of the nation it seems to be this. People are not enthusiastic about this government. Of those who voted Labour in May 1997, roughly 70% defected in Preston this time, (a figure which no doubt reflects disputes in the local party over who should be its candidate), roughly 60% in West Bromwich, and just about half in Anniesland.</p> <p>But there is no great enthusiasm either for trying to turn Labour out. In the great byelections of the Thatcher years, which helped engineer her eviction from office 10 years ago this week, what struck terror in Conservative hearts was not just Tory defections but the positive surge in Labour or Lib Dem support.

      "bodyText": "There's no doubt who came best out of last night's round of byelections, in Preston, West Bromwich and the Anniesland division of Glasgow, where vacancies had to be filled both for Westminster and for the Scottish parliament. This was a very good night for the Can't Be Bothered party, and a pretty dispiriting moment for anyone else. It is easy to tell the story in terms of Labour majorities slashed: down from 18,680 to 4,426 in Preston; down from 15,154 to 6,337 in the Westminster contest at Anniesland. (You can't make any comparison for West Bromwich, since in May 1997 Betty Boothroyd stood as the Speaker Seeking Re-election and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats did not put up candidates against her). But these aren't the statistics that really matter. The lower the turnouts in byelections, the less figures for majorities and for swing from one side to the other tell you about the real electoral world. And these turnouts were very low: not as abject as at some of the previous byelections in this parliament, but a mere 38% in Scotland, 30% in Lancashire and 28% in the Midlands. In these circumstances it makes sense to look at the figures in a less conventional way, and concentrate less on each party's share of the vote than on the proportion of the electorate which bothered to turn out for each of them. Analysed in this fashion, the story at Preston was this: around 13% of those entitled to vote took the trouble to go to the polling stations and mark their crosses for Labour. Some 7% did the same for the Tories; while 70% stayed at home. In West Bromwich, the figures were very similar: 14% of those entitled to vote gave their support to Labour, 9% turned out for the Tories, 72% stayed away. In Glasgow Anniesland, the figures for the Westminster election show 20% turning out for Labour, 8% for the Scottish National Party and 4% for the Tories, with 62% preferring to do something else. In the election for the Scottish parliament, the SNP did rather better than in the Westminster contest and Labour a little worse, but again the stayaways were the majority tendency at 62%. So these contests were very much a minority preoccupation. In so far as one can detect the mood of the nation it seems to be this. People are not enthusiastic about this government. Of those who voted Labour in May 1997, roughly 70% defected in Preston this time, (a figure which no doubt reflects disputes in the local party over who should be its candidate), roughly 60% in West Bromwich, and just about half in Anniesland. But there is no great enthusiasm either for trying to turn Labour out. In the great byelections of the Thatcher years, which helped engineer her eviction from office 10 years ago this week, what struck terror in Conservative hearts was not just Tory defections but the positive surge in Labour or Lib Dem support. There was little sign of a similar process here. The SNP vote in Anniesland, a seat where these great byelection fighters must have had some hope of making a splash, was down on May 1997. The Tories were no real threat to Labour - even in West Bromwich, where because of the reintroduction of party politics after the Boothroyd years they should have been raring to go. In that context - and especially after the autumn of discontent which shook Labour so badly - Mr Blair today may be feeling a sense of reprieve. On the other hand, when he turns to the morning papers, and the headlines on Europe and beef and petrol prices (once more), he may well have started to feel queasy again.

      "body": "<p>For a top-flight fashion photographer, Terry Richardson has a somewhat over-developed love of nudity. Clothes often take second place to bare skin. He is perennially in a season of flesh tones, transparency so see-through it's invisible and micro-minis so micro they don't exist. Add to this his tendency to eschew the traditional glitz and glamour of fashion photography - in which every colour is techni, every lip glossed and every blemish airbrushed - in favour of the raw and undercooked, and it's a strange state of affairs that these days fashion editors just can't get enough of him. </p> <p>Indeed, Richardson, whose first solo UK exhibition opens this week, is a gawky 35-year-old with mutton-chop sideburns and tache, dishevelled dress, seedy specs and a disarming line in being direct - more errant artist than fashion type. But though he has only been shooting fashion since the early 90s, his trademark technique has - along with those of Wolfgang Tilmans and Juergen Teller - played a key role in changing its ethos from one favouring images of heightened superficiality to ones that hastily catch a moment or begin a narrative. He takes the kind of intriguing, sometimes voyeuristic pictures in which no model is ever ready for her close-up, Mr De Mille. </p> <p>\"Fashion is all showbusiness and people hype but my work brings a sense of humour to fashion photography,\" Richardson says. \"I aim to have that in everything I do. A lot of fashion photography can be very serious, very precious. The pictures don't make you smile, or horny, or anything really. They don't even seem human. They just record clothes. But to me photography is a document of what's going on in my life that day. It's personal, about whatever I'm feeling, whether it's fashion or nudes.\" </p> <p>It was this individualistic attitude that in 1992 took Richardson from his home town of Hollywood, leaving the too-distant glimmerings of a career as a bassist in a hip-hop metal band, to Manhattan, with his camera. There his sometimes brutal coverage of the East Village underground scene in the early 90s had editors at first puzzled, then dismissive - and finally knocking down his door. </p> <p>Richardson had always understood photography: his father is Bob Richardson, a seminal fashion photographer of the 60s and 70s. But his big break came when, after spending the early 90s slumming around the Big Apple with barely anything to eat but always something to shoot, he produced a story for the American music magazine Vibe. This was shown at the International Festival de la Mode in Paris in 1994, which led to a job shooting an ad campaign for Katharine Hamnett. </p> <p>From there Richardson's documentary style took off in a flash - of the kind that creates plenty of red-eye. Work for i-D, Harper's Bazaar, Arena Homme Plus and several Vogues followed, as did ad campaigns for brands as giant and diverse as Levi's, H&amp;M and West Cigarettes, and music videos for Death in Vegas and Primal Scream. His next projects include a third issue of Richardson, the magazine he launched last year to equal amounts of acclaim and tittering, a move into film and a shoot for the famed swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. Perhaps sadly for Richardson, the cossies will have to stay on. </p> <p>\"I just like the way men's and women's bodies are,\" he says. \"They are all so different. They fascinate me. It can be sexy and everyone relates to sex. Most people have had it at least once in their lives. I like sex and I like women, and I guess any photographer wants to take pictures of the things they like. But there's also an innocence to nudes. After all, that's the way we enter the world. And it's a real beauty in that muscle, flab, hair, skin, texture. I just think it's cool, man!\" </p> <p>Not all the publications Richardson has worked for have felt the same; some have been uncomfortable with his nipple count, not to mention that of even more private parts of the anatomy, while the censor's scissors and magic markers have occasionally come out in force prior to publication of books of his work. But he likes \"to shake things up a bit,\" he says. \"And what one person takes offence at makes another giggle. You know certain images are going to ruffle conservative people and that's fun. I once took a picture of me that suggested I was having sex with a sheep, which caused all sorts of outraged responses, but to me and people who know me it was just fun.\" </p> <p>Less gratuitously, it is more his eye for the bumps, dips, slides and hills of people's bodies that is exercised in his new exhibition. Sometimes anatomical, sometimes sculptural, this series of nudes goes beyond sheer shock value to capture an intimate dynamic between subject and sharp-shooter. For him, exposure means much more than light meters and film stock. One series, taken at a nudist camp, even features Richardson unclothed. </p> <p>\"I would never ask anyone to do what I wouldn't do myself,\" he says. \"And besides, getting naked is kind of exhilarating. It's a trip. It makes you nervous but you move through it. It's strange but liberating. And when you take a picture of someone naked, it's interesting to see their reaction: some, usually the ones you least expect, are really shy and others get really excited. And I like to get right in there because they have to be comfortable with you - that's when you get a certain connection. And that can make for a beautiful moment.\" </p>",

But his big break came when, after spending the early 90s slumming around the Big Apple with barely anything to eat but always something to shoot, he produced a story for the American music magazine Vibe. This was shown at the International Festival de la Mode in Paris in 1994, which led to a job shooting an ad campaign for Katharine Hamnett. From there Richardson's documentary style took off in a flash - of the kind that creates plenty of red-eye. Work for i-D, Harper's Bazaar, Arena Homme Plus and several Vogues followed, as did ad campaigns for brands as giant and diverse as Levi's, H&amp;M and West Cigarettes, and music videos for Death in Vegas and Primal Scream. His next projects include a third issue of Richardson, the magazine he launched last year to equal amounts of acclaim and tittering, a move into film and a shoot for the famed swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated. Perhaps sadly for Richardson, the cossies will have to stay on. \"I just like the way men's and women's bodies are,\" he says. \"They are all so different. They fascinate me. It can be sexy and everyone relates to sex. Most people have had it at least once in their lives. I like sex and I like women, and I guess any photographer wants to take pictures of the things they like. But there's also an innocence to nudes. After all, that's the way we enter the world. And it's a real beauty in that muscle, flab, hair, skin, texture. I just think it's cool, man!\" Not all the publications Richardson has worked for have felt the same; some have been uncomfortable with his nipple count, not to mention that of even more private parts of the anatomy, while the censor's scissors and magic markers have occasionally come out in force prior to publication of books of his work. But he likes \"to shake things up a bit,\" he says. \"And what one person takes offence at makes another giggle. You know certain images are going to ruffle conservative people and that's fun. I once took a picture of me that suggested I was having sex with a sheep, which caused all sorts of outraged responses, but to me and people who know me it was just fun.\" Less gratuitously, it is more his eye for the bumps, dips, slides and hills of people's bodies that is exercised in his new exhibition. Sometimes anatomical, sometimes sculptural, this series of nudes goes beyond sheer shock value to capture an intimate dynamic between subject and sharp-shooter. For him, exposure means much more than light meters and film stock. One series, taken at a nudist camp, even features Richardson unclothed. \"I would never ask anyone to do what I wouldn't do myself,\" he says. \"And besides, getting naked is kind of exhilarating. It's a trip. It makes you nervous but you move through it. It's strange but liberating. And when you take a picture of someone naked, it's interesting to see their reaction: some, usually the ones you least expect, are really shy and others get really excited. And I like to get right in there because they have to be comfortable with you - that's when you get a certain connection. And that can make for a beautiful moment.\"",

      "bodyText": "Here is a timeline of the rail crisis which has ensued since the Hatfield crash last month. 17 October: The Hatfield rail disaster kills four and injures 33. The Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, tenders his resignation. 18 October: It emerges that Railtrack knew for six months that the GNER line, which had a broken rail, was faulty. 19 October: Paddington rail crash survivors urge Mr Corbett not to resign. Mr Corbett's resignation is later refused by Railtrack. 20 October: Mr Corbett secures a \u00a35bn grant from the regulator for safety. 22 October: There is a memorial service for Hatfield victims. Mr Corbett attends. 24 October: Railtrack shuts Scottish end of the West Coast Mainline from Glasgow to London with no warning to commuters. A total of 165 speed restrictions are imposed. 26 October: Another derailment at Virginia Water in Surrey when four carriages carrying 150 to 200 passengers on the 8.21am South West trains service from Weybridge to Staines went through a red light. The number of speed restrictions increased to almost 300 and 2,000 cracks are found in railways around the country. 27 October: Mr Corbett is summoned to Downing Street to discuss safety. 30 October: Mr Corbett's claims about the duration of repairs prove incorrect and it emerges that work will take two months longer than expected. The worst storms since 1987 begin. The proportion of track disrupted hits 70%, some 20,000 miles. Just 10% of GNER services run. 1 November: Mr Corbett gives evidence to the Select Committee for Transport and blames Balfour Beatty, the maintenance firm, for not detecting the damage. 2 November: The deputy prime minister, Mr Prescott, refuses to back Mr Corbett. 5 November: Allegations are made in The Mirror that Railtrack execs went on a drinking binge hours after the Hatfield disaster. 9 November: The prime minister, Tony Blair, meets Mr Corbett and other rail executives and orders them to produce a Christmas timetable within a week. 10 November: Mr Corbett apologises to victims of the Paddington and Southall rail crashes after reducing some to tears by saying that rail safety was \"like a journey where you never arrive.\" 11 November: The rail regulator, Tom Winsor, criticises Railtrack for a \"culture of complacency\" over the broken rails. 13 November: Railtrack announce 5% increase in dividends to shareholders, despite a 31% slump in profits to \u00a3175m. 15 November: Railtrack pledges to bail out the train operators to keep them in business and cancels parties because the company is in \"corporate mourning\". 16 November: Mr Corbett and other rail chiefs meet Mr Blair again to discuss compensation for passengers. It is revealed that delays will continue into next year. 17 November: Mr Corbett resigns. 24 November: A rail expert is reported to have told ministers that the speed restrictions might actually be prejudicial to safety. It also emerges that some rail firms may be \"let off\" paying poor performance penalties as the industry reportedly loses \u00a32m a day.

      "bodyText": "The rail industry is losing \u00a32m in revenue a day because of the chaos caused from flooding and post-Hatfield crash repairs and some rail experts believe current speed restrictions are actually prejudicial to safety, it was revealed today. A sense of rail meltdown was compounded as cash-strapped train companies were revealed to be in urgent talks with the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority to see if they can be \"let off\" penalty payments for poor performance. One company - GB Railways, which runs the Anglia route - is seeking new franchise terms to ease its financial plight. The extent of the daily financial losses was revealed by the Association of Train Operating Companies. It came after a report in the Economist magazine which said the SSRA chairman, Sir Alastair Morton, had privately told government ministers that passengers would be safer if post-Hatfield speed restrictions were removed and trains allowed to run normally. On the question of penalties, the SSRA today dismissed the Economist report as \"idle speculation\", but did confirm it was talking to a number of train companies about the possibility of waiving penalty payments. A spokeswoman for the authority said: \"One of our jobs is to try to assist train operating companies (TOCs) where this is necessary. \"We have said that each TOC, if they feel they are in a financial situation due to the events of October, if they put a case to the SSRA, their case will be looked at and judged.\" She added: \"If we feel it is necessary, we will relax the penalty payment rules, because of the unusual circumstances of October. A lot of the problems are not down to the TOCs. \"It is not a blanket relaxation. Each company will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\" A spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies said: \"Passengers should be reminded that although some companies have been particularly badly hit by the delays, there are 10 companies who have been relatively unaffected. \"Companies offering inter-city routes have faced the biggest financial loss, while some lines have escaped with only very few temporary speed restrictions.\" Drivers are currently having to consult up to 16 pages of special directions on changes to speed limits introduced after the Hatfield crash, increasing the chance that they might pass a red signal, the Economist also claimed. Professor Andrew Evans, of University College London, a transport expert, said the rail improvement programme was costing lives as it forced passengers on to the much more dangerous roads. Asked to estimate the effect the switch from rail to road was having on fatal accident figures he said: \"I think about one a week, possibly one fatality a week. \"It certainly does not make sense if the object of the exercise is to minimise the number of premature deaths.\" The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, said the work being carried out did not make sense. He blamed the government for forcing the train companies to act irrationally. Meanwhile, disgruntled rail passengers, sick of months of delays, stormed off of a train and began walking across the tracks, a traveller said today. The revolt came after a failed train, said to have run out of fuel, held up the service on the Leeds to Skipton line in West Yorkshire, which has been plagued by delays since July. Passengers feared they were once again going to be abandoned at the station at Keighley, West Yorkshire. One group, including regular commuter Keith Norris, went to warn the driver that he must complete his journey. But others simply quit the train in dismay, Mr Norris told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He said: \"I do understand people did actually get off and cross the track which, to be honest, I have been travelling by train for 12 years and nobody I know would have dared attempt that. It was stupidity really.\" Related special reports Special report:transport in Britain Special report:the Hatfield train crash Weather watch The Paddington train crash Related stories 25 October: Prescott refuses to back Railtrack chief 19 October: Railtrack boss told to stay 18 October: Gerald Corbett - the high flyer who couldn't keep on the rails Useful links Gerald Corbett's CV Office of the Rail Regulator Gerald Corbett speech defending privatisation Railtrack plc",

The brothers, Maurice and Charles, who are of Jewish-Iraqi origin, set up Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 1970. By 1986, it had become the world's largest advertising agency, with clients including the Conservative party, for whom it crafted the \"Labour isn't Working\" campaign. The controversial campaign, featuring a lengthy dole queue, clinched the brothers' position as Lady Thatcher's favourite advertising bosses. Their creativity continued in slogans for British Airways, \"The world's favourite airline\", and Castlemaine lager, \"Australians wouldn't give a XXXX for anything else\". Maurice and Charles were ousted from S&amp;S in 1995 and since then have built M&amp;C into one of the UK's most successful ad agencies. Today, Maurice is the Conservative party's treasury spokesman in the House of Lords, while Charles has become an important patron of the arts. M&amp;C Saatchi's performance during 1999 led it to be named Campaign magazine's agency of the year. An outstanding new-business record - which included the capture of Rover cars, along with a great deal of work from Sainsbury's and BT - saw it outshine any other agency in London. M&amp;C had proved it could contest and win significant new business on its own merits and not only because of the high-level contacts of its founding partners. The agency has gone from a standing start in 1995 to the number six spot in the agency billings table, one place above Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, with a 7.3% rise in the year to September 2000. (Figures from AC Nielson.) Its success has made the agency an attractive target for potential buyers but Maurice vowed this year that he will never sell a majority stake in the agency.",

      "bodyText": "There are u-turns and there are huge u-turns, but France managed to pull off what must rate, by even its own standards, as an astonishing volte-face this week over BSE and nobody in the UK objected - not even the Tories. As fears over the safety of French beef multiplied and countries such as Italy and Spain queued up to say \"non\" to Gallic meat imports, Paris began to panic and look for a way out of the crisis which threatens to decimate its farming industry. Jean Glavany, France's pugnacious terrier-like farm minister, led the charge: the import bans on French beef were unfair and must be lifted forthwith, he thundered at a marathon meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels. Desperate to appease his country's militant farmers and anxious to bolster consumer confidence in French beef, which is draining away by the hour, the Frenchman demanded that countries which slap a unilateral ban on his country's meat must produce scientific evidence to support their action. Seventeen hours later a deal was struck: EU veterinary experts would evaluate the evidence provided by the offending countries and make their own minds up on whether a ban on French beef could be scientifically justified. \"It's a miraculous result, an unhoped-for success,\" Glavany crowed after the all-night talks wound up. \"I certainly hope that these measures can be lifted as soon as possible on the grounds they are not justified.\" No wonder he was pleased - he had just completed a u-turn of jaw dropping proportions and got away with it. For the principal reason why France says it cannot lift its own illegal ban on British beef imports is because it regrets that it cannot accept the opinion of the very same panel of EU experts. Instead, Paris steadfastly maintains that the only people worth listening to are its own scientists who continue to think that \"le boeuf britannique\" is still not safe. It was only last year that the EU scientists issued their opinion that British beef is in their view safe to eat and said there was no justification to ban the meat. But France disagreed and remains the only member state to keep a ban in place, and, as a result, faces legal action in the European Court of Justice. So how, you may wonder, can France choose to disregard the EU scientists' advice on British beef but all of a sudden be ready to abide by their opinion on French beef? Double standards, crushing hypocrisy and naked opportunism have all been suggested as possible motives in the past week by various observers, but Monsieur Glavany for one was keeping mum on the night and repeatedly refused to be drawn on the issue. He could, however, be in for a nasty shock. For if EU scientists decide that a member state is justified in restricting French imports, the European Commission could turn the action into an EU-wide measure, applying it to all countries. The scientists have until the end of the month to pronounce on the bans. But if they do agree with countries such as Italy, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands, which have all moved to restrict French beef imports in the past weeks, will France still continue to have faith in their judgement or will it return to its former scepticism?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This is Oscar Wilde's moment. Next Thursday is the centenary of his death, and it is being marked by a themed set of programmes this evening on the BBC's Knowledge channel, by exhibitions at the British Library, the Barbican and the Geffrye Museum in east London, and by a welter of books on Oscariana - his trials, tabletalk, wit, sexuality, even his wallpaper. Ireland is taking the occasion even more seriously: issuing Wilde stamps and devoting three weeks of programmes, including productions of all the plays, to one of Dublin's great literary sons. It is a long way from Wilde's ignominious and self-pitying death in Paris in 1900. </p> <p>It is his grandson Merlin Holland's moment too: his new edition of Wilde's letters has just been published, he co-curated the exhibition at the British Library, and he is dashing between the UK, France, Ireland and the US, co-ordinating the Wilde commemoration and appearing at conferences and seminars to discuss his fabled forebear. For Holland, it is the culmination of a gradual coming to terms with his grandfather's legacy. </p> <p>There was a moment of hesitation before Holland would agree to this interview. A reporter called on him recently to discuss the letters but spent most of her article describing the shabby gentility of his circumstances; or more precisely the leaking ceiling of his flat in Tooting, south London. So I must first put on record that his airy, spacious, book-lined flat overlooking Tooting Common is actually very nice, despite the leak. </p> <p>Holland is 54, fleshy (I would say like Oscar, but he would hate that), and shaggy-haired. He frequently flips back his fringe with his hand, wears multi-coloured slippers and smokes a lot considering it is nine in the morning, but otherwise the bohemianism is kept in check. Being the grandson of Oscar Wilde has not been an easy role, and only in the past few years has he worked out how to play it. </p> <p>When he left university he wanted to write, but worried that people would compare his efforts unfavourably with Oscar's, so he went to work in the Middle East for five years before disappearing in the deserts of academic publishing. </p> <p>Only in the mid-80s, when he began to help his mother to administer the Wilde estate, and then in 1987 when he fell out with Richard Ellmann over aspects of his biography of Wilde (in particular, whether he had died from syphilis), did he begin seriously to study his grandfather's life. </p> <p>His father, Vyvyan, had gone through a similar process of denial and, late in life, accommodation with Wilde's legacy. Vyvyan had been a child when Wilde was imprisoned and never saw him again after 1895. Vyvyan's mother, Constance, died in 1898, and her family tried to obliterate the memory of Oscar and his homosexuality. Vyvyan was educated abroad, separated from his elder brother, Cyril (who was killed in the first world war), had his surname changed and spent 40 years trying to embrace the memory of his father. </p> <p>Eventually, marriage late in life to Merlin's mother and the need to earn money after he was declared bankrupt in 1950 allowed (or compelled) him to acknowledge Oscar, and he wrote several books about his father, including the highly regarded Son of Oscar Wilde. Even in the 50s, when Merlin was growing up, Wilde was still notorious enough for parents to ensure that their precious children didn't get too close to him at school. </p> <p>\"My father led a very difficult life up until the time he married my mother in 1943,\" says Holland, \"and it was largely down to her that anything was done about the Wilde legacy. He started to acknowledge it, but there wasn't a great deal of difference between the attitude to Wilde in the 50s and that in the 20s and 30s. There had been revivals of his plays and he was a bit more acceptable, but homosexuality was still illegal and he was still seen as tainted.\" </p> <p>Before meeting Holland, I had assumed that he would merrily play the part of Oscar's representative on earth, but the reverse is true. He dislikes the fact that people want to shake his hand as a way of getting in touch with the great man's DNA, and recalls being offhand with a woman who had come up to him after a lecture and said how proud he must feel to be Wilde's grandson. </p> <p>\"She looked terribly crestfallen at my rudeness and said: 'But you should see it from our point of view.' I apologised and said I would try, but I feel very uncomfortable with it because it doesn't allow me to be me. It puts on me the necessity to be an appendage to somebody else, answering your grandfather's fan mail. My father chose not to do it, and, anyway, it wasn't really necessary then; I hope my son won't have to do it; I'm halfway between the two. </p> <p>\"I've never wanted to go to conferences and simply be treated as a living descendant of the person being studied. I would find that deeply disturbing: this monkey in a cage, throw him a handful of peanuts, what's he going to do? Do you look like him, are you capable of turning words in his way, can you be humorous? People come up to you at book signings and say: 'Can you write something funny?' A greater killer than that you can't imagine. I suppose what I wanted at some stage was an acceptance of the fact that what I was doing had a value.\" With the publication of his expanded edition of Wilde's letters, he hopes he finally has that. </p> <p>Holland's 21-year-old son, Lucian, studied classics at Magdalen, Oxford, where Wilde had himself been a brilliant classics scholar. When Lucian was allocated a room in 71 High Street, where Wilde had lived for a term, Holland thought the similarities were getting out of hand. \"I said to Lucian at the time: 'I don't give a damn about your sexuality, but for goodness sake keep out of the courts.' The coincidences had gone far enough.\" </p> <p>Holland is by no means an uncritical flag-waver for his grandfather, but he stresses the undeniable fact about Wilde - his agelessness. Whereas Ruskin, say, feels like a seer from a distant era, Wilde is like the caustic wit you saw on television yesterday.

John Carey's question about Shaw applies even better to his contemporary and fellow Dubliner, Oscar Wilde. It is one thing to admire Wilde, across the reach of that 20th century which he said pedantically he would not live to see, just before he died in November 1900. But it is a mistake to hero-worship him, to idolise him as a gay martyr or to treat him as a deep thinker and great writer. Or almost wrong. There is a twist in Wilde's career which makes his ghastly destruction all the more bitter. </p> <p>The new edition of his letters shows Wilde as a complicated mixture of good and bad, admirable and dislikeable. His last letters are horribly depressing, so many of them about the money he desperately needed. But poverty and desperation rarely have a good effect on anyone's character. When he fell out with Carlos Blacker, one of the few people who had maintained their friendship with him after his fall, Wilde wrote spitefully: \"Of course, the fact of his being a Jew on his father's side explains everything.\" </p> <p>In an objective sense, Wilde is a victim: a stupid and cruel law imprisoned him and broke him in body and spirit. But he would not at all have wanted to be remembered as a martyr for gay rights. Until he allowed the horrible Alfred Douglas to egg him on to the fatal suit against Queensberry, Wilde had been a rather successful careerist, keeping just within the bounds of convention. In court he insisted that his love of Bosie was pure and platonic. </p> <p>Nor does Wilde cut a convincing figure as political or social thinker. The Soul of Man Under Socialism is a charming work, without an ounce of serious economic theory in it, and for that reason has worn rather better than many heavier tracts. A utopian fantasy of a world with no disease, toil or ugliness is all very well, and more attractive than Fabian blueprints for a planned society, but Wilde doesn't begin to explain how this idyll will be achieved, simply and wrongly assuming that there were enough material goods in the world to go round without anyone doing much work. </p> <p>The only thing less convincing is any attempt to invoke Wilde for the cause of Irish nationalism, as is now the fashion. He just wasn't an ideologue. What he was, at his best, was a man of deeply humane and generous instincts. Nothing he ever wrote was nobler than a letter for publication immediately after his release from Reading jail, describing the horrors the prison system inflicted on children and the weak-minded. </p> <p>Wildely uneven might describe Oscar as an imaginative writer. His children's stories are delightful: The Happy Prince on an old 78 disc with picture book still brings tears to my eyes, very many years on. But The Picture of Dorian Gray is complete tosh, a foolish imitation of some pretty silly French writing. </p> <p>Recently the plays have been enjoying another revival, but this only serves to show something Richard Ellmann missed in his somewhat lifeless life of Wilde. The difference between Lady Windermere's Fan and An Ideal Husband on the one hand and his last play, The Importance of Being Earnest, on the other is one of kind and not degree. Too much in the earlier plays is another sort of tosh, tedious paradox-mongering and epigram- cracking. It's often hard to distinguish Wilde's lines - \"One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything\" - from the Wildean Lady Dundown in Alan Bennett's Forty Years On. (\"All women dress like their mothers. That is their tragedy.

      "bodyText": "This is Oscar Wilde's moment. Next Thursday is the centenary of his death, and it is being marked by a themed set of programmes this evening on the BBC's Knowledge channel, by exhibitions at the British Library, the Barbican and the Geffrye Museum in east London, and by a welter of books on Oscariana - his trials, tabletalk, wit, sexuality, even his wallpaper. Ireland is taking the occasion even more seriously: issuing Wilde stamps and devoting three weeks of programmes, including productions of all the plays, to one of Dublin's great literary sons. It is a long way from Wilde's ignominious and self-pitying death in Paris in 1900. It is his grandson Merlin Holland's moment too: his new edition of Wilde's letters has just been published, he co-curated the exhibition at the British Library, and he is dashing between the UK, France, Ireland and the US, co-ordinating the Wilde commemoration and appearing at conferences and seminars to discuss his fabled forebear. For Holland, it is the culmination of a gradual coming to terms with his grandfather's legacy. There was a moment of hesitation before Holland would agree to this interview. A reporter called on him recently to discuss the letters but spent most of her article describing the shabby gentility of his circumstances; or more precisely the leaking ceiling of his flat in Tooting, south London. So I must first put on record that his airy, spacious, book-lined flat overlooking Tooting Common is actually very nice, despite the leak. Holland is 54, fleshy (I would say like Oscar, but he would hate that), and shaggy-haired. He frequently flips back his fringe with his hand, wears multi-coloured slippers and smokes a lot considering it is nine in the morning, but otherwise the bohemianism is kept in check. Being the grandson of Oscar Wilde has not been an easy role, and only in the past few years has he worked out how to play it. When he left university he wanted to write, but worried that people would compare his efforts unfavourably with Oscar's, so he went to work in the Middle East for five years before disappearing in the deserts of academic publishing. Only in the mid-80s, when he began to help his mother to administer the Wilde estate, and then in 1987 when he fell out with Richard Ellmann over aspects of his biography of Wilde (in particular, whether he had died from syphilis), did he begin seriously to study his grandfather's life. His father, Vyvyan, had gone through a similar process of denial and, late in life, accommodation with Wilde's legacy. Vyvyan had been a child when Wilde was imprisoned and never saw him again after 1895. Vyvyan's mother, Constance, died in 1898, and her family tried to obliterate the memory of Oscar and his homosexuality. Vyvyan was educated abroad, separated from his elder brother, Cyril (who was killed in the first world war), had his surname changed and spent 40 years trying to embrace the memory of his father. Eventually, marriage late in life to Merlin's mother and the need to earn money after he was declared bankrupt in 1950 allowed (or compelled) him to acknowledge Oscar, and he wrote several books about his father, including the highly regarded Son of Oscar Wilde. Even in the 50s, when Merlin was growing up, Wilde was still notorious enough for parents to ensure that their precious children didn't get too close to him at school. \"My father led a very difficult life up until the time he married my mother in 1943,\" says Holland, \"and it was largely down to her that anything was done about the Wilde legacy. He started to acknowledge it, but there wasn't a great deal of difference between the attitude to Wilde in the 50s and that in the 20s and 30s. There had been revivals of his plays and he was a bit more acceptable, but homosexuality was still illegal and he was still seen as tainted.\" Before meeting Holland, I had assumed that he would merrily play the part of Oscar's representative on earth, but the reverse is true. He dislikes the fact that people want to shake his hand as a way of getting in touch with the great man's DNA, and recalls being offhand with a woman who had come up to him after a lecture and said how proud he must feel to be Wilde's grandson. \"She looked terribly crestfallen at my rudeness and said: 'But you should see it from our point of view.' I apologised and said I would try, but I feel very uncomfortable with it because it doesn't allow me to be me. It puts on me the necessity to be an appendage to somebody else, answering your grandfather's fan mail. My father chose not to do it, and, anyway, it wasn't really necessary then; I hope my son won't have to do it; I'm halfway between the two. \"I've never wanted to go to conferences and simply be treated as a living descendant of the person being studied. I would find that deeply disturbing: this monkey in a cage, throw him a handful of peanuts, what's he going to do? Do you look like him, are you capable of turning words in his way, can you be humorous? People come up to you at book signings and say: 'Can you write something funny?' A greater killer than that you can't imagine. I suppose what I wanted at some stage was an acceptance of the fact that what I was doing had a value.\" With the publication of his expanded edition of Wilde's letters, he hopes he finally has that. Holland's 21-year-old son, Lucian, studied classics at Magdalen, Oxford, where Wilde had himself been a brilliant classics scholar. When Lucian was allocated a room in 71 High Street, where Wilde had lived for a term, Holland thought the similarities were getting out of hand. \"I said to Lucian at the time: 'I don't give a damn about your sexuality, but for goodness sake keep out of the courts.' The coincidences had gone far enough.\" Holland is by no means an uncritical flag-waver for his grandfather, but he stresses the undeniable fact about Wilde - his agelessness. Whereas Ruskin, say, feels like a seer from a distant era, Wilde is like the caustic wit you saw on television yesterday. What fees he would now command on chat shows and for articles in the broadsheets. Tom Wolfe, Gore Vidal and every other elegantly erudite essayist would be left scrabbling and scribbling in the dust. \"There is an awful thought at the back of my mind that it's the emperor's new clothes,\" says Holland. \"But I dismiss it. One has to remind oneself that, as he said, he 'roused the imagination of the century'. He is a bridge between the Victorian world and our own, and people always think he lived more recently than he did. By the start of the 1990s people thought he had died in the 1920s and been a contemporary of No\u00ebl Coward. There's an element of wanting to have him in the 20th century, as part of our century, because of his vibrant modernity.\" So is he now firmly established in the literary canon? \"I hope not,\" says Holland. \"The one thing that has made him survive are the ups and downs of his reputation. The insecurity of his reputation has ensured that he has always been talked about. Both his champions and his detractors want to have their say.\" Holland is working on a book about the ebb and flow of Wilde's reputation, and thinks then he will draw a line under his excursions into family history. \"Ultimately, the one thing that all this has taught me is that there is a razor's edge between being somebody biologically and having to accept that fact, but at the same time putting yourself in a comfortable position. To deny one's genetic make-up is a long road to mental anguish. My father suffered by denial, but you can also suffer by being a monkey in a cage. You have to find a way between the two.\" 'The Picture of Dorian Gray is complete tosh' By Geoffrey Wheatcroft He was a great something, but a great what? John Carey's question about Shaw applies even better to his contemporary and fellow Dubliner, Oscar Wilde. It is one thing to admire Wilde, across the reach of that 20th century which he said pedantically he would not live to see, just before he died in November 1900.

Surrey police refused to discuss the charges but confirmed that he was released on conditional bail to appear before Staines magistrates court on November 30.

Sources said that the matters being investigated were of a \"very serious nature\". Some of the incidents of alleged abuse go back to the late 1970s and 1980s, when Mr King ran a successful recording and publishing company. The former public schoolboy, who shot to fame at the age of 21 with the song Everyone Has Gone To The Moon, discovered a number of bands including Genesis and 10cc. His arrest comes after several men approached police with claims that they were abused as youngsters. Detectives searched Mr King's home yesterday and removed a number of items for analysis.

      "bodyText": "Sue Robertson, director of corporate affairs at United Broadcasting &amp; Entertainment, has been made redundant. The move follows the acquisition of United by Granada Media earlier this year. Ms Robertson, who was on a six-figure salary, will leave the company at the end of the year and has not yet decided what she will do after that. She said: \"I haven't got to the point of making that decision yet. It didn't really work out with Granada because they already have someone in doing that job.\" A Granada spokeswoman said it had not been possible to find a position for Ms Robertson in the merged company. She said: \"She's helped us a great deal with the integration programme, but that has now finished. \"Sue is very highly regarded but obviously we've already got Susan Donovan in the same position here.\" Ms Robertson joined United a year ago from Channel 4, where she was head of corporate affairs. She had been with Channel 4 for four years. In a separate development, Tracey O'Connor, head of factual press at United, has quit to join Channel 5 as head of entertainment. She replaces Greg Day, who has left the station to set up his own PR company.",

      "body": "<p>The men came every night. Striding through Soho, shutting off their senses to the aromas of cheap Chinese food and traffic fumes that curled into their nostrils and threatened to contaminate their palates. For two solid months they made the same journey eastwards from their base in Notting Hill, west London, and every night they entered the same doorway. </p> <p>Inside, the restaurant was small but it was lively and the food was good. Methodically, the men ate their way through the menu from top to bottom: chewing slowly; holding each mouthful for a few moments; letting the flavours seep through their saliva; analysing the taste; committing it to memory. </p> <p>They made no secret of their mission. \"We are spies,\" they told the restaurant manager, and explained how they had come to work out how to make his specialities, and in particular his signature dish, spaghetti-lobster, so they could copy them in their own restaurant on the other side of town. </p> <p>Aldo Zilli, the victim of this attempt at plagiarism, was not impressed by the results. He has since opened a restaurant, Zilli Fish, in Notting Hill and close to the restaurant he claims tried to copy his food. So did it succeed? \"It's not so good, of course it is not. How do I know? Because I went to try it. They haven't got a clue. For example, with my spaghetti-lobster they boil the lobster before they put it in the sauce.\" </p> <p>Well they won't now. Not if they're reading this, at least. </p> <p>But Zilli's story offers a fascinating insight into a world of culinary intrigue and espionage few know exist. And the stakes are high - not just because a restaurant lives or dies by the food it serves. In the age of the celebrity chef and lucrative television and publishing deals, there are millions of pounds to be made. </p> <p>Some chefs are brazen. \"I rarely want to eat restaurant food unless I'm looking for new ideas or recipes to steal,\" says the American chef and writer Anthony Bourdain, in his book Kitchen Confidential. </p> <p>Nevertheless, recipe theft can be a sensitive subject. The fabled French chef Jacques Maximin once mounted an unsuccessful campaign to prevent chefs copying each other's recipes. And some of our most eminent chefs have been openly accused of theft, among them the treble-Michelin- starred Marco Pierre White who worked for a spell under the chef Pierre Koffmann at La Tante Claire. </p> <p>In his unauthorised biography of White, Charles Hennessy writes: \"Pierre Koffmann says, 'Marco only came to steal my recipes. But he's one of the best chefs I ever had - always looking, always listening, wanting to absorb as much as possible as quickly as possible.' \" </p> <p>White's defence is straightforward. \"The best pupils go to the best teachers,\" he says. \"By definition, things rub off. I worked for Pierre Koffmann and for the Rouxs. I learned from them and I developed my own distinctive style. But I also credit my sources. On my menu at the Oak Room I have Pied de Cochon Pierre Koffmann. At Drones, which will open in December, there is Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e Boxtree.\" (Boxtree is a restaurant in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, where White worked at the beginning of his career.) </p> <p>Perhaps White has learnt the hard way. There is at least one dish - oysters with champagne jelly and watercress - that most would agree he invented but when Marco was resident at the restaurant at the Hyde Park Hotel every dish on the menu was dated, apparently signifying the year he considered he created it. Alas, it only encouraged other chefs to point out his unacknowledged sources. </p> <p>There are two issues here. The first is the creative aspect of cooking; the personal stamp or flair brought by an individual chef to a menu. The second is the science in recipe - the nature and quantity of the ingredients, the precise cooking times, the peculiar method used for, say, soaking and draining parsley. </p> <p>The situation is made infinitely complex by ambiguities in the law. An inventor can patent his work, giving him sole right to make use of and sell his invention. The creations of a chef are not protected in the same cut and dried way. Hence the tantrums, accusations and counter-accusations of theft that from time to time burst out of the basement pressure cookers that are restaurant kitchens. </p> <p>Let's deal with the creative aspect first. In English law you cannot copyright an idea for a recipe or anything else. It is impossible to copyright a combination of food such as the serving of pan-roasted Bresse pigeon with chestnuts (the River Cafe Cookbook). Even if you could, it would be next to impossible to prove that, among the millions of versions of recipes evolved over thousands of years, the idea was definitely yours. Unless you opt for the truly outlandish - like Aldo Zilli's sushi pizza or the Birdcage restaurant's foie gras and coconut soup - there is very little that is new. As Alastair Little, whom one food writer once called \"the most plagiarised chef of our time\", says: \"There are only so many different ways to apply heat and only so many combinations of flavours.\" </p> <p>To illustrate his point, Little refers to a recipe that can be found in Soho Cooking, his most recent cookbook, for Pain Perdu or \"lost bread\". It is a version of a nursery favourite, eggy bread with apple. \"I got it out of a French cookbook by a guy called Marc Meneau,\" Little admits freely. \"I adapted it slightly and started serving it. My co-chef, Juliet [Peston], adapted it further and, when she left, made a feature of it in another restaurant. What really annoyed me was when I read in a newspaper that I had appropriated the idea from Juliet when in fact I was an intermediary between Juliet and the original, which anyway is a recipe in the common domain. Everyone does eggy bread in some form or another. You can't attribute its invention to anyone.\" </p> <p>This is perhaps just as well. Wouldn't it be dull not to be able to eat chicken wrapped in prosciutto or spaghetti with anchovy sauce because some chef in Portsmouth had nabbed the patent? It's when you try to protect the nuts and bolts of a recipe that things get complicated. While it is true that a trainee chef will learn hundreds of \"classical methods\", the idea of a secret recipe that people would kill to lay their hands on is not entirely ridiculous. The formula for Coca-Cola is closely guarded. The internet is overflowing with supposed secret recipes that people have bothered to put there, including one that claims to recreate KFC as you find it in the bucket. </p> <p>It is whispered that some restaurants guard their secret recipes so jealously that when they publish restaurant cookbooks they leave out a crucial detail in each. The recipe will still work, but it will not be quite as good as it should be. </p> <p>Under English copyright laws, as long as a recipe is written down it is protected as a literary work, in the same way as a poem or a play. This is essential in safeguarding the phraseology of the method, the bits that baby you through the caramelising of onions, for example. It is why Delia can publish and protect her recipe for how to boil an egg. But what if someone completely rewrote the method but it could be seen that it was fundamentally the same way of egg-boiling, only expressed differently. Where would Delia stand then? </p> <p>\"A grey area, I think,\" says Charlie Swan, a partner at the Simkins Partnership, a media law firm. Food copyright is full of such areas but fortunately one thing is clear cut - making your own food based on a recipe is perfectly legal. Judges ruled long ago that you do not infringe the copyright on Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book if you make a rabbit pie using one of her recipes. But what of list of ingredients? Can you steal a recipe, add half a teaspoon of salt and pass it off as your own? The answer is, probably not. \"The definition of a literary work includes compilations, such as the telephone directory. You might argue that the list of ingredients was a compilation,\" says Swan. </p> <p>Chefs have another legal saviour in the laws of confidence which protect trade secrets. \"If, for example, you poached someone from a restaurant kitchen and asked them to spill all its secrets then there would be questions about industrial espionage,\" says Swan. </p> <p>\"And if you've got a restaurant with its own secret recipes and they are written down, if someone physically makes a copy of them either with the photocopier or by hand then that is a copyright infringement.\" </p> <p>This does happen, as Sally Clarke of Clarke's bakery and restaurant in Notting Hill, London, found out a few years ago when one of her kitchen staff was discovered photocopying recipes a week before she was due to return to New Zealand. Clarke took legal advice and battled with her employee until she admitted to having made the copies and returned them. \"It was a very nasty experience,\" says Clarke, \"but I wouldn't be surprised if she was in New Zealand now, running her own bakery and using our recipes.\" </p> <p>These days Clarke is careful. Only recipes used for the bakery are written down because they require precision and do not change seasonally, as the restaurant food does. She keeps just one copy of each under lock and key in her office. </p> <p>In the end, creativity and precision merge. Be as scientific as you like but without flavour you will get nowhere. For Sally Clarke's secret recipes are not so much original as adapted. Like fashion designers, chefs will go on resurrecting old ideas - from polenta to pot-au-feu - and adding a twist. </p> <p>\"You take an idea and then you refine, refine, refine it,\" says Marco Pierre White, \"until it is as good as it can be and that is what it's all about.\" </p> <p>And perhaps that is what the spaghetti-lobster thieves are missing: a soup\u00e7on of inspiration.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British government is preparing to commit troops as part of an international observer force in the troubled Gaza Strip and West Bank. Although Israel remains opposed to it, the idea, put forward by France and Britain, is gathering momentum. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the US pushed the Israeli and Palestinian delegations into discussing it secretly in New York this week. Britain is prepared to contribute to the mission despite its forces being stretched by their involvement in Sierra Leone, Bosnia and Kosovo. The Palestinians have been pressing for an international force in the region, where daily clashes have claimed about 250 lives, mainly Palestinian. To make the proposal more acceptable to Israel, the British and French have avoided using the word \"force\", stressing that the mission would be made up of unarmed observers. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"They would not be peacekeepers inserting themselves between warring factions; they would be observing what was going on: a visible presence reporting back.\" About 100-200 observers are envisaged, with the hope that their presence would act as a psychological deterrent. The spokesman stressed that Israeli agreement was essential. Mr Annan met the Israeli and Palestinian delegations at UN on Wednesday, and he and US representatives persuaded the two sides to sit down together. \"The Israelis are still resisting, but at last they are talking, and that has to be good,\" a UN source said. Talks on the form the mission should take, and on the number of personnel, are continuing. A French government source said: \"We want to be flexible. It is to find a mechanism for saving everyone's face and reducing tension.\" Western diplomats reported that senior Israelis were wavering, but that the increase in violence this week hardened the opposition of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. However, an article in the liberal Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz yesterday called for an international observer force, and suggested that Israel's real objection stemmed from a fear that its behaviour in the conflict would be studied under international standards. Another Israeli objection is that its acceptance of the force would amount to rewarding the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, for the violence. Privately, the Israelis have been warning Britain and France that in the past such international missions have become targets, as in Beirut. The prominent Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said yesterday that thepresence of observers had proved useless in Hebron. \"What we want is an international force with a mandate to protect the Palestinians and hold the Israelis responsible. It should be mobile and have the ability to intervene,\" Ms Ashrawi said. \u0095 Prime minister Ehud Barak was set last night to meet Ariel Sharon, the hardline leader of the opposition Likud party. Palestinians accused Israel of assassinating a leader of the Islamist Hamas movement yesterday in the West Bank. Meanwhile yesterday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, and a third was reportedly killed at Anata village near Jerusalem.

I am not so sure, partly because Nigella Lawson clearly is one - or at the very least the Shirley Conran of our time. The latest volume does not have the clarity and freshness of her first volume, How to Eat, but it includes lip-smacking stuff nonetheless, in characteristically crisp prose.</p> <p> Among restaurant chefs there are some pretty lively goodies, notably <strong>Cooking At The Merchant House</strong> by Shaun Hill (Conran Octopus, \u00a320 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502429632,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), Rick Stein's <strong>Seafood Lovers' Guide</strong> (BBC, \u00a320 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240347,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) and <strong>Real Greek Food</strong> by Theodore Kyriakou and Charles Campion (Pavilion, \u00a325 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000368733,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>).

      "bodyText": "West Bromwich West was not contested by Tories and Lib Dems in 1997 as it was the seat of then Speaker Betty Boothroyd. Labour's Adrian Bailey won West Bromwich West with 9,640 votes, over the Conservatives' Karen Bissell on 6,408 and the Lib Dems' Sadie Smith on 1,791. The seat was not contested by the Tories and Lib Dems in the 1997 general election, as it was held by the Speaker, Betty Boothroyd, who stood down from the Commons on its return from summer recess last month. Conservative chairman Michael Ancram said: \"I am pleased with the West Bromwich West result. This is a 2% swing to us from 1992, when we won the general election. \"It is a significant result compared to where we would have been at the last general election had the seat been contested. \"It is a bad result for Labour in their heartlands and a good result for Conservatives in the West Midlands. We had a good local candidate who fought an effective and relevant campaign.\" After the declaration, Mr Bailey said voters in West Bromwich West had sent a message to Tory leader William Hague that people did not want to see cuts in public services. He said: \"People want this Labour government because it shares their priorities - delivering more money for pensioners, more bobbies on the beat, more jobs, improving schools and more money for a bigger and better NHS. Defeated Tory candidate Karen Bissell said the by-election represented an exceptional result for the Conservatives. \"In the heart of the Black Country - in an area that should be safe Labour territory - the Labour Party have just managed to cling on. The general election can't come soon enough.\" There have been boundary changes since she fought as a Labour candidate in the 1992 General Election when Tories won a narrow majority in the Commons. However notional figures calculated for PA News by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of Plymouth University suggested Labour would have had a 13% lead at West Bromwich West if the alterations had been in force that year compared with 17% this time. Just 27.6% of the electorate in West Bromwich West went to the polls.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair was still on course early today for a second general election victory next May after Labour held on to three \"heartland\" byelection seats against the hopes of the Conservatives and the Scottish Nationalists.</p> <p>But the party's successful defence of West Bromwich West, where the vacancy was created by Betty Boothroyd's resignation as Speaker, as well as in Preston and the late Donald Dewar's seat in Glasgow Anniesland, was won on low voter turnouts among Labour loyalists - which led to modest swings against the government.</p> <p>\"Apathy is the winner,\" conceded one Millbank party official as the turnout was found to be 27.6% in West Bromwich, 29.7% in Preston and a healthier 38% in Anniesland where Mr Dewar's Westminster and Edinburgh parliamentary seats were at stake.</p> <p>As party strategists on all sides pored over the runes there was consolation for them all. The Tories, who had quietly nursed hopes in Miss Boothroyd's West Midlands industrial villages, claimed the two English results - including a 9% swing in Preston, but only 2% in West Bromwich - would severely dent Mr Blair's 179 Commons majority.</p> <p>In reality, only defeats might have made Mr Blair rethink his expected strategy of calling the election next spring, probably on May 3 after another generous budget from Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The poll upset after the September fuel protest and the pensions row - which put the Conservatives ahead for the first time since 1992 - has been reversed since the pre-budget report. But Labour will be nervous at the low turnout.</p> <p>The SNP also claimed to have hurt Labour in Glasgow. But neither leftwing chal lenges from a Socialist Alliance candidate who got 1,210 votes in Preston, nor the British National party's 794 votes in West Bromwich made as much of an impact as some Labour MPs feared.</p> <p>In Glasgow the Scottish Socialists also polled a modest 1,429.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was still on course early today for a second general election victory next May after Labour held on to three \"heartland\" byelection seats against the hopes of the Conservatives and the Scottish Nationalists. But the party's successful defence of West Bromwich West, where the vacancy was created by Betty Boothroyd's resignation as Speaker, as well as in Preston and the late Donald Dewar's seat in Glasgow Anniesland, was won on low voter turnouts among Labour loyalists - which led to modest swings against the government. \"Apathy is the winner,\" conceded one Millbank party official as the turnout was found to be 27.6% in West Bromwich, 29.7% in Preston and a healthier 38% in Anniesland where Mr Dewar's Westminster and Edinburgh parliamentary seats were at stake. As party strategists on all sides pored over the runes there was consolation for them all. The Tories, who had quietly nursed hopes in Miss Boothroyd's West Midlands industrial villages, claimed the two English results - including a 9% swing in Preston, but only 2% in West Bromwich - would severely dent Mr Blair's 179 Commons majority. In reality, only defeats might have made Mr Blair rethink his expected strategy of calling the election next spring, probably on May 3 after another generous budget from Gordon Brown. The poll upset after the September fuel protest and the pensions row - which put the Conservatives ahead for the first time since 1992 - has been reversed since the pre-budget report. But Labour will be nervous at the low turnout. The SNP also claimed to have hurt Labour in Glasgow. But neither leftwing chal lenges from a Socialist Alliance candidate who got 1,210 votes in Preston, nor the British National party's 794 votes in West Bromwich made as much of an impact as some Labour MPs feared. In Glasgow the Scottish Socialists also polled a modest 1,429. The UK Independence party also slipped back in the face of William Hague's robust efforts to reconsolidate the core Tory vote behind his team. Labour's Adrian Bailey, a former librarian who is also deputy leader of the local Sandwell council, won West Bromwich West with 9,640 votes, over the Conservatives' Karen Bissell on 6,408. The Lib Dems' Sadie Smith came in third with 1,791. The seat was not contested by the Tories and Lib Dems in the 1997 general election, because Miss Boothroyd, now a peer, was Speaker.

      "body": "<p>Al Gore made it plain last night that he is gearing up to push the United States into a third week of uncharted post-election territory.</p> <p>Sixteen days after the country voted inconclusively, his campaign team responded to its latest reverse in the courts by saying that it would challenge the results from the Florida county that refused to carry out the recount he had hoped would ease his passage to the White House.</p> <p>His decision to fight on, whether or not he is ahead when the final Florida recount comes in on Sunday, means that this weekend is now unlikely to see a final decisive moment in the bitterly disputed election.</p> <p>Yesterday the Florida supreme court declined to order election officials in Miami-Dade to recount the votes in the strongly Democratic county.</p> <p>They had refused to do so because, they said, there was no way of meeting the 5pm Sunday deadline.</p> <p>But the Gore camp said it would launch a fresh appeal in the US supreme court in the state capital Tallahassee on Monday, challenging the result in Miami-Dade, where more than 600,000 votes were cast, probably on the grounds that evidence material to the outcome of the election had not been taken into account.</p> <p>The winner in Florida gains the state's 25 members of the electoral college, enough to make him president.</p> <p>Ron Klain, a Gore adviser, said: \"It's important that there be a full, fair and accurate count of these votes. We would prefer that it would be sooner rather than later, but it's going to happen.</p> <p>\"If Miami-Dade files a return that leaves out these votes we are going to contest that return, probably on Monday.\"</p> <p>The Democrats say they still believe that they will find enough votes to overcome George W Bush's official lead of 930 votes in Florida.</p> <p>But Mr Gore is not picking up the extra support he had expected in the two counties still working towards the Sunday deadline. By last night he had acquired an extra 88 votes in Broward county, which takes in Fort Lauderdale, making a net gain there of 225 against Mr Gore's lead. Broward has almost finished working its way through 2,000 disputed ballots.</p> <p>Palm Beach, the county that introduced the world to the vagaries of Floridian elections, took a day off from counting yesterday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will be back at work today. It has re-examined but not finalised 300,000 ballots and must complete work on a further 10,000 disputed papers. There, Mr Bush has picked up a net 14 votes, leaving him with an unofficial lead of 719.</p> <p>A Palm Beach county judge has said that \"dimpled chad\" - ballot cards which show an indentation but no perforation - must be counted, provided that the voter's intention is clear.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, was in a Washington hospital recovering from \"a very slight heart attack\" - his fourth. He had surgery on Wednesday to implant an artery-clearing device.</p> <p>\"I can tell you they didn't find any pregnant chads,\" Mr Cheney, 59, quipped on television.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore made it plain last night that he is gearing up to push the United States into a third week of uncharted post-election territory. Sixteen days after the country voted inconclusively, his campaign team responded to its latest reverse in the courts by saying that it would challenge the results from the Florida county that refused to carry out the recount he had hoped would ease his passage to the White House. His decision to fight on, whether or not he is ahead when the final Florida recount comes in on Sunday, means that this weekend is now unlikely to see a final decisive moment in the bitterly disputed election. Yesterday the Florida supreme court declined to order election officials in Miami-Dade to recount the votes in the strongly Democratic county. They had refused to do so because, they said, there was no way of meeting the 5pm Sunday deadline. But the Gore camp said it would launch a fresh appeal in the US supreme court in the state capital Tallahassee on Monday, challenging the result in Miami-Dade, where more than 600,000 votes were cast, probably on the grounds that evidence material to the outcome of the election had not been taken into account. The winner in Florida gains the state's 25 members of the electoral college, enough to make him president. Ron Klain, a Gore adviser, said: \"It's important that there be a full, fair and accurate count of these votes. We would prefer that it would be sooner rather than later, but it's going to happen. \"If Miami-Dade files a return that leaves out these votes we are going to contest that return, probably on Monday.\" The Democrats say they still believe that they will find enough votes to overcome George W Bush's official lead of 930 votes in Florida. But Mr Gore is not picking up the extra support he had expected in the two counties still working towards the Sunday deadline. By last night he had acquired an extra 88 votes in Broward county, which takes in Fort Lauderdale, making a net gain there of 225 against Mr Gore's lead. Broward has almost finished working its way through 2,000 disputed ballots. Palm Beach, the county that introduced the world to the vagaries of Floridian elections, took a day off from counting yesterday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will be back at work today. It has re-examined but not finalised 300,000 ballots and must complete work on a further 10,000 disputed papers. There, Mr Bush has picked up a net 14 votes, leaving him with an unofficial lead of 719. A Palm Beach county judge has said that \"dimpled chad\" - ballot cards which show an indentation but no perforation - must be counted, provided that the voter's intention is clear. Meanwhile the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, was in a Washington hospital recovering from \"a very slight heart attack\" - his fourth. He had surgery on Wednesday to implant an artery-clearing device. \"I can tell you they didn't find any pregnant chads,\" Mr Cheney, 59, quipped on television. He said the incident would not affect his ability to serve and that he hoped to leave hospital in a day or two. Mr Bush also filed suit in a Florida court, asking to order 13 counties with heavy large military populations to count overseas ballots. But in most of America, consideration of Messrs Gore and Bush, dimpled ballots, chads, court hearings, election theft, hand-counting, machine tallies, military votes and whether Warren Christopher is the most lugubrious mouthpiece in the history of spin were largely set aside in favour of Thanksgiving Day and its concommitent perils. These include friends, family, the tension induced by trying to get in front of the television before the Minnesota Vikings-Dallas Cowboys football game begins and securing the best bargains at the holiday sales, and massive ingestion of turkey, stuffing, cranberries and pumpkin pie. Mr Bush started the day with a jog, had lunch with friends in Austin, and then headed home to the ranch near Waco. Mr Gore stayed indoors at his official residence in Washington.

He also had cancer of the bowel, lungs and liver. </p> <p>Mr Jordan's daughter, Joanne Silverwood, 35, said: \"If it had been an animal the RSPCA would have been called in to investigate that ward.

      "bodyText": "An NHS trust yesterday launched an investigation into allegations that a man with cancer was left to die on a mental health ward. The family of Lawrence Jordan say he was given only paracetamol to relieve his pain, and was so neglected he was covered in his own excrement, and bruises from falling out of bed. Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS trust admitted having a shortage of nurses and will meet Mr Jordan's family next week. Mr Jordan,73, died in August after being admitted for tests after the onset of dementia. He was treated for seven weeks on ward five at Leicester general hospital. The 20-bed ward to assess older people with mental health problems was Victorian, according to Mr Jordan's family who say it reeked of urine. He was found to have a tumour behind his eye that was so large it caused his eye to bulge and was pressing on his brain. He also had cancer of the bowel, lungs and liver. Mr Jordan's daughter, Joanne Silverwood, 35, said: \"If it had been an animal the RSPCA would have been called in to investigate that ward. He was treated worse than an animal.\" \"One nurse said that they couldn't move him as there would be too much paper work. Another nurse was in tears and said 'sorry he's not getting the care he should be getting'.\" The family say they had to battle to get Mr Jordan a specialist cancer nurse and a private room for his last few days. Joanne's sister Alicia Jordan, 33, said: \"They made him wear incontinence pants even though he wanted to go to the toilet. They wouldn't clean him for hours.

      "body": "<p>The BBC and ITV last night laid down a non-negotiable deal for Britain's three main political party leaders to take part in the country's first televised election debate. </p> <p>Setting aside their recent squabbles, the broadcasters outlined plans for two live prime time clashes between Tony Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy. </p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats reacted positively, but the Conservatives appeared to place a stumbling block in front of the plans by repeating their call for three one-on-one debates between the leaders. </p> <p>If the deal goes ahead, it will be the first time that such an event has happened in Britain. Some observers believe live debates can make or break a leader's chances of electoral success, and they tend to favour challengers rather than incumbents. But Mr Blair is thought to believe he would come off best in a clash with either or both of his opponents. </p> <p>Under the plan, the three leaders would face each other in two live debates, screened separately on BBC1 and ITV. The BBC's version would be chaired by David Dimbleby, and ITV's would be fronted by his brother, Jonathan. </p> <p>The debates would be staged in front of a representative audience picked by an independent polling organisation. The guests would be able to applaud, but would not have an opportunity to ask questions. Each debate would cover three key subjects, and the leaders would making brief opening and closing statements, before taking questions from the presenter. They would be able to cross-examine each other. </p> <p>Parties in Scotland and Wales have also been invited to take part in debates screened on the networks in the two nations. Proposals for Northern Ireland are in the pipeline. </p> <p>Previous attempts to stage a set piece election debate have foundered on disputes over the format - the BBC-ITV deal is an attempt to present a united front. </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, has already hinted that Mr Blair would be willing to take part in a TV clash. He has already agreed to take part in an Ask the Prime Minister debate for ITV, to be presented next month by Jonathan Dimbleby. A Labour spokesman said yesterday's proposal would be considered.

      "bodyText": "The BBC and ITV last night laid down a non-negotiable deal for Britain's three main political party leaders to take part in the country's first televised election debate. Setting aside their recent squabbles, the broadcasters outlined plans for two live prime time clashes between Tony Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy. Labour and the Liberal Democrats reacted positively, but the Conservatives appeared to place a stumbling block in front of the plans by repeating their call for three one-on-one debates between the leaders. If the deal goes ahead, it will be the first time that such an event has happened in Britain. Some observers believe live debates can make or break a leader's chances of electoral success, and they tend to favour challengers rather than incumbents. But Mr Blair is thought to believe he would come off best in a clash with either or both of his opponents. Under the plan, the three leaders would face each other in two live debates, screened separately on BBC1 and ITV. The BBC's version would be chaired by David Dimbleby, and ITV's would be fronted by his brother, Jonathan. The debates would be staged in front of a representative audience picked by an independent polling organisation. The guests would be able to applaud, but would not have an opportunity to ask questions. Each debate would cover three key subjects, and the leaders would making brief opening and closing statements, before taking questions from the presenter. They would be able to cross-examine each other. Parties in Scotland and Wales have also been invited to take part in debates screened on the networks in the two nations. Proposals for Northern Ireland are in the pipeline. Previous attempts to stage a set piece election debate have foundered on disputes over the format - the BBC-ITV deal is an attempt to present a united front. The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, has already hinted that Mr Blair would be willing to take part in a TV clash. He has already agreed to take part in an Ask the Prime Minister debate for ITV, to be presented next month by Jonathan Dimbleby. A Labour spokesman said yesterday's proposal would be considered. The Liberal Democrats were also positive. But while the Tories said they would consider the plan, the party chairman Michael Ancram repeated his call for a series of three one-on-one debates between the leaders and expressed opposition to the three-way format. Executives at the BBC and ITV said the three-way clash would produce a more cohesive debate. Writing to the politicians, they said it would \"engage the electorate in the significance and excitement of democracy in action\". Tony Hall, director of BBC News, said: \"Televised leaders' debates are a familiar part of the electoral landscape across the democratic world and it's time British voters had the same opportunity to see the politicians in action.\" Steve Anderson, ITV's controller of news and current affairs, added: \"That is why we are setting aside the usual trench warfare between news broadcasters and uniting behind this important project.\" The BBC and ITV have given the three leaders a deadline of the end of January to respond to the challenge.

      "body": "<p>Long Island. Well, it is long: 120 miles long to be exact, though most of it is less than 20 miles wide. Few have been able to aptly describe life on this finger of land east of Manhattan (population 2.6m) or to find apt metaphors for its unique combination of the bizarre and the ordinary. </p> <p>In Massapequa in 1992, Amy Fisher, the Long Island Lolita, shot the wife of her lover Joey Buttafuoco in the head; and in Garden City in 1993, Colin Ferguson killed six commuters in a shooting rampage on the Long Island railroad. Yet it was also on Long Island that a pioneering new planned town of cookie-cutter houses known as Levittown, now a generic term, opened for business in 1947. </p> <p>We're talking suburbia. Between the western New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn and the fertile agricultural plots and chic resorts in the eastern section, Long Island is suburbs. Some wealthy, others strictly working-class, its towns are a mixed bag of old and new, textured and tacky, substantial and empty. The fictional Jay Gatsby lived in a mansion on the north shore, Jackson Pollock painted on the south shore, Walt Whitman was born in the centre. But the Gold Coast mansions frequented by the Fitzgeralds have deteriorated; Pollock's rustic Hamptons are now an almost parodic retreat for the newly rich; and the huge Walt Whitman mall overshadows the poet's small clapboard house in Huntingdon. </p> <p>Long Island has its apologists. Among them is New York City-based film-maker Eric Mendelsohn, whose debut feature, Judy Berlin, is set completely on the island, and earned him the best director prize at Sundance last year, He grew up there with the movie's leading lady, Edie Falco, now of Sopranos fame. </p> <p>\"Because there is such conformity on Long Island, there are weird expressions of individualism,\" says Mendelsohn, a dark-haired 36-year-old with an angelic face. \"On a block where houses are exactly the same, someone will have put in a pagoda or a goldfish pond. A lot of people in the Long Island suburbs are self-conscious about feeling stupid, but I find that charming.\" </p> <p>Falco, part Italian and part Swedish, was born in West Islip, then moved to upper-middle-class Northport. \"We were part of the lower echelon there,\" she says. Her accent is strong Long Islandese, as in \"lawn giland\". She feels that Long Islanders get a bad rap in movies. \"They're an easy target. I object to the stereotype. They're close enough to Manhattan to be in the loop, but far enough away to have a civilised life. The way they're portrayed in movies is kind of a drag: not being particularly intelligent, not being aware of what's going on in the world around them.\" </p> <p>Hal Hartley is Long Island's best-known independent film-maker, and his second movie, Trust, is set in his native Lindenhurst, a working-class town. It features an angry Martin Donovan carrying a hand grenade wherever he goes, a more memorable presence than confused teen Adrienne Shelly, or even tacky older sister Edie Falco. Then there's Edward Burns's overrated Sundance winner The Brothers McMullen. (The John Hurt starrer Love and Death on Long Island hardly counts - it certainly wasn't shot on the island - and the protagonists of Greg Mottola's The Daytrippers and Jonathan Demme's Married to the Mob are shown fleeing the place.) Trees Lounge, Steve Buscemi's liquor-soaked directorial debut, remains a rare sympathetic high point of Long Island lore, and you have to go back to Frank Perry's 1985 black comedy Compromising Positions for a bearable, and funny, portrait of Long Island life. </p> <p>\"Films about Long Island focus more on the men than the women,\" Mendelsohn complains. \"In a place that is forgotten and maligned, there's no greater candidate for patron sainthood than the women of Long Island, who are also forgotten in films. They are enormously strong, interesting people.\" He has turned the genre upside-down, in large part because his mostly female characters have a stoicism and grace lacking in Hartley's work. </p> <p>The focus of Judy Berlin is the eponymous Babylon resident, a part he wrote for Falco. Judy is an ebullient, overeager aspiring actress of 32 with huge braces on her teeth and a one-way ticket to Hollywood in her handbag. Most of Judy's scenes are with her former high-school pal, David Gold (Aaron Harnick), a sad cynic who says he makes documentary films but has returned, feeling a failure, to his parents' home. His folks are even unhappier than he: his mother, Alice (Madeline Kahn, in her last role), is a housewife with nothing but time on her hands. </p> <p>On an unseasonably cold Sunday morning in late October, Mendelsohn and I take the train out to the areas where he shot the $200,000 film. We get out an hour later in Farmingdale, the old three-storey, brick-and-wood train station of which is the setting for Judy Berlin's opening and closing scenes. In a bakery filled with pastel-coloured cup cakes, screaming children and parents in baseball caps, we discuss the film's surreal structure. About 20 minutes in, a full eclipse begins, and does not go away. The characters act out their frustrations in the same darkness that envelops the audience. The device is, Mendelsohn insists, a \"problem solver\", one of many terms he learned from Woody Allen while working on costumes for all his films from Crimes and Misdemeanours to Everyone Says I Love You. </p> <p>\"I wanted a disruption,\" he says. \"I wanted to show this little place and take one step to the left of absolute reality, which an eclipse conveniently provides.\" In most of the neighbourhood scenes, the \"little place\" is his native suburb of Old Bethpage, where his Bronx-born parents - Jay, a retired research scientist for an aeronautics company, and Marlene, a schoolteacher - raised him and his three brothers and sister. We leave the bakery and hire a taxi. Mendelsohn whispers to me that our driver Randi, a hefty, affable young woman, is very Judy Berlin-ish. We drive over to Old Bethpage, passing the redbrick strip mall where, in the film, David reluctantly re-encounters Judy in the film after a 14-year hiatus. Then we go past the Mendelsohn family home in a carefully-planned neighbourhood chock full of sycamore, maple, and pine trees. </p> <p>Randi lets us out at the visitor centre. Snow falls. Geese wander; cows and bulls are penned in the distance. \"This is the one place on Long Island that hasn't been touched by commercialism, that doesn't feel like Disneyland,\" says Mendelsohn. \"Part of growing up here was looking for something more mysterious than the town. So much of Long Island seems prefabricated, but I knew there had to be a history, so I loved coming here.\" We pass the Williams farm where Judy worked, then on to the Noon Inn, home to the Noons 150 years ago, now populated by a fiddler, bartender, and assorted women in period gear, some with non-period parkas on top. </p> <p>The restoration, though something of a rupture, fits into Mendelsohn's masterplan: nothing in the film looks or seems quite real. He shot the film in a pristine black and white that is almost as artificial as Technicolor, and the harpsichord on the soundtrack reinforces the feeling of estrangement. \"I'm not interested in v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" he says. </p> <p>We are now back in Farmingdale; Randi has taken us to the Library Cafe, a library-turned-diner where a football game plays on four suspended screens and, for no apparent reason, carousel animals hang from the ceiling. \"Judy Berlin is a fairy tale about real life and suburban hard knocks,\" he continues. \"On top of its Jewish humour and serious melancholy is the science- fiction aspect of an eclipse. Black and white helps loosen people from their preconceived notions of what the suburbs are. With colour, you would have seen the FedEx trucks going by, the H\u00e4agen-Dazs logo. It would have all been familiar. The easiest way to direct an audience's eyes to a performance is to eradicate colour.\" </p> <p>And he is proud of the performances he gets. \"Madeline Kahn's work in this film stands up with any of the studio films she's done, or the stage performances she's given.\" Mendelson says he learned to trust actors from Woody Allen. \"He lets them go,\" he says, citing Allen's confidence during the showing of dailies. \"What I began to realise is that you are renting out an actor's unfinished, compelling personality for a month. That's what they are selling: something unexamined about themselves that people find interesting to look at.\" </p> <p>He saw this especially in Kahn. \"She was nervous and delicate and fragile. But those moments when she was being Alice Gold, she was hot, she was on, and she knew it. At rehearsals in her apartment, I once said, 'It must be so hard to be you,' and she said, 'Thank you for saying that.' I do think it was hard for her to get through the day sometimes.\" Kahn was diagnosed with cancer a few months after filming wrapped. </p> <p>\"For me, Judy Berlin is a success from the beginning of the movie. I'm in love with people like Judy who are real believers. Whatever is put in front of them in life, they go through with a machete.\" </p> <p>Falco sees her differently. \"I think she would give LA a shot for a while. It probably wouldn't work out, and she would go into something else and be very good at it.\" I proceed to tell her about Randi the cabbie. \"That's it!\" she yelps into the receiver. \"That's what she ends up doing in LA! She drives a taxi!\" </p> <p> \u0095 Judy Berlin is released next Friday.</p>",

Among them is New York City-based film-maker Eric Mendelsohn, whose debut feature, Judy Berlin, is set completely on the island, and earned him the best director prize at Sundance last year, He grew up there with the movie's leading lady, Edie Falco, now of Sopranos fame. \"Because there is such conformity on Long Island, there are weird expressions of individualism,\" says Mendelsohn, a dark-haired 36-year-old with an angelic face. \"On a block where houses are exactly the same, someone will have put in a pagoda or a goldfish pond. A lot of people in the Long Island suburbs are self-conscious about feeling stupid, but I find that charming.\" Falco, part Italian and part Swedish, was born in West Islip, then moved to upper-middle-class Northport. \"We were part of the lower echelon there,\" she says. Her accent is strong Long Islandese, as in \"lawn giland\". She feels that Long Islanders get a bad rap in movies. \"They're an easy target. I object to the stereotype. They're close enough to Manhattan to be in the loop, but far enough away to have a civilised life. The way they're portrayed in movies is kind of a drag: not being particularly intelligent, not being aware of what's going on in the world around them.\" Hal Hartley is Long Island's best-known independent film-maker, and his second movie, Trust, is set in his native Lindenhurst, a working-class town. It features an angry Martin Donovan carrying a hand grenade wherever he goes, a more memorable presence than confused teen Adrienne Shelly, or even tacky older sister Edie Falco. Then there's Edward Burns's overrated Sundance winner The Brothers McMullen. (The John Hurt starrer Love and Death on Long Island hardly counts - it certainly wasn't shot on the island - and the protagonists of Greg Mottola's The Daytrippers and Jonathan Demme's Married to the Mob are shown fleeing the place.) Trees Lounge, Steve Buscemi's liquor-soaked directorial debut, remains a rare sympathetic high point of Long Island lore, and you have to go back to Frank Perry's 1985 black comedy Compromising Positions for a bearable, and funny, portrait of Long Island life. \"Films about Long Island focus more on the men than the women,\" Mendelsohn complains. \"In a place that is forgotten and maligned, there's no greater candidate for patron sainthood than the women of Long Island, who are also forgotten in films. They are enormously strong, interesting people.\" He has turned the genre upside-down, in large part because his mostly female characters have a stoicism and grace lacking in Hartley's work. The focus of Judy Berlin is the eponymous Babylon resident, a part he wrote for Falco. Judy is an ebullient, overeager aspiring actress of 32 with huge braces on her teeth and a one-way ticket to Hollywood in her handbag. Most of Judy's scenes are with her former high-school pal, David Gold (Aaron Harnick), a sad cynic who says he makes documentary films but has returned, feeling a failure, to his parents' home. His folks are even unhappier than he: his mother, Alice (Madeline Kahn, in her last role), is a housewife with nothing but time on her hands. On an unseasonably cold Sunday morning in late October, Mendelsohn and I take the train out to the areas where he shot the $200,000 film. We get out an hour later in Farmingdale, the old three-storey, brick-and-wood train station of which is the setting for Judy Berlin's opening and closing scenes. In a bakery filled with pastel-coloured cup cakes, screaming children and parents in baseball caps, we discuss the film's surreal structure. About 20 minutes in, a full eclipse begins, and does not go away. The characters act out their frustrations in the same darkness that envelops the audience. The device is, Mendelsohn insists, a \"problem solver\", one of many terms he learned from Woody Allen while working on costumes for all his films from Crimes and Misdemeanours to Everyone Says I Love You. \"I wanted a disruption,\" he says. \"I wanted to show this little place and take one step to the left of absolute reality, which an eclipse conveniently provides.\" In most of the neighbourhood scenes, the \"little place\" is his native suburb of Old Bethpage, where his Bronx-born parents - Jay, a retired research scientist for an aeronautics company, and Marlene, a schoolteacher - raised him and his three brothers and sister. We leave the bakery and hire a taxi. Mendelsohn whispers to me that our driver Randi, a hefty, affable young woman, is very Judy Berlin-ish. We drive over to Old Bethpage, passing the redbrick strip mall where, in the film, David reluctantly re-encounters Judy in the film after a 14-year hiatus. Then we go past the Mendelsohn family home in a carefully-planned neighbourhood chock full of sycamore, maple, and pine trees. Randi lets us out at the visitor centre. Snow falls. Geese wander; cows and bulls are penned in the distance. \"This is the one place on Long Island that hasn't been touched by commercialism, that doesn't feel like Disneyland,\" says Mendelsohn. \"Part of growing up here was looking for something more mysterious than the town. So much of Long Island seems prefabricated, but I knew there had to be a history, so I loved coming here.\" We pass the Williams farm where Judy worked, then on to the Noon Inn, home to the Noons 150 years ago, now populated by a fiddler, bartender, and assorted women in period gear, some with non-period parkas on top. The restoration, though something of a rupture, fits into Mendelsohn's masterplan: nothing in the film looks or seems quite real. He shot the film in a pristine black and white that is almost as artificial as Technicolor, and the harpsichord on the soundtrack reinforces the feeling of estrangement. \"I'm not interested in v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" he says. We are now back in Farmingdale; Randi has taken us to the Library Cafe, a library-turned-diner where a football game plays on four suspended screens and, for no apparent reason, carousel animals hang from the ceiling. \"Judy Berlin is a fairy tale about real life and suburban hard knocks,\" he continues. \"On top of its Jewish humour and serious melancholy is the science- fiction aspect of an eclipse. Black and white helps loosen people from their preconceived notions of what the suburbs are. With colour, you would have seen the FedEx trucks going by, the H\u00e4agen-Dazs logo. It would have all been familiar. The easiest way to direct an audience's eyes to a performance is to eradicate colour.\" And he is proud of the performances he gets. \"Madeline Kahn's work in this film stands up with any of the studio films she's done, or the stage performances she's given.\" Mendelson says he learned to trust actors from Woody Allen. \"He lets them go,\" he says, citing Allen's confidence during the showing of dailies. \"What I began to realise is that you are renting out an actor's unfinished, compelling personality for a month. That's what they are selling: something unexamined about themselves that people find interesting to look at.\" He saw this especially in Kahn. \"She was nervous and delicate and fragile. But those moments when she was being Alice Gold, she was hot, she was on, and she knew it. At rehearsals in her apartment, I once said, 'It must be so hard to be you,' and she said, 'Thank you for saying that.' I do think it was hard for her to get through the day sometimes.\" Kahn was diagnosed with cancer a few months after filming wrapped. \"For me, Judy Berlin is a success from the beginning of the movie. I'm in love with people like Judy who are real believers. Whatever is put in front of them in life, they go through with a machete.\" Falco sees her differently. \"I think she would give LA a shot for a while. It probably wouldn't work out, and she would go into something else and be very good at it.\" I proceed to tell her about Randi the cabbie. \"That's it!\" she yelps into the receiver. \"That's what she ends up doing in LA! She drives a taxi!\" \u0095 Judy Berlin is released next Friday.",

      "body": "<p>A three-room suite at New York's Regency hotel has been booked for the weekend so that the foreign press can interview Woody Allen for the European opening of Small Time Crooks. When I arrive on Saturday, the video cameras are whirring, journalists are stacked in orderly fashion like planes waiting for take-off at La Guardia, and a variety of accents can be heard as questions technical and metaphysical are volleyed across the language barrier and answers are graciously batted back. </p> <p>I'm reminded of the scene in Notting Hill where Julia Roberts is being interviewed by representatives of any and every publication, from the most illustrious to the most obscure - the funniest and most far-fetched being Horse and Hound's Hugh Grant. As reporters clamber over each other for a moment with the Hollywood diva, Grant tries to convince her of her importance to the fox-hunting and steeplechasing set. </p> <p>Allen's rapport with the European press is a love-fest - rather more so than is the case with American journalists. The French, the English, the Italians adore him unreservedly and, as someone points out in Wild Man Blues, Barbara Kopple's affecting 1997 documentary about his jazz tour of Europe, his films are greeted and loved there as equals, all of the same stature. In America, some are hits, some are flops. Critics draw sharp distinctions among them. \"Maybe they gain something in translation,\" he says wryly. </p> <p>His wife Soon-Yi, who accompanied him on the Wild Man Blues tour, confesses disarmingly she didn't much like Interiors. She was very young, she blushes, and found it tedious. \"So did the American critics,\" he hastens to assure her. And when Soon-Yi, emboldened, adds that \"it drones on and on\", Woody replies that Europeans like films that drone on and on. </p> <p>It's that gift for self-mockery, a razor-sharp appreciation of life and his own neuroses - even as he is struggling in their vice-like grip - that makes him at once so endearingly contemporary and at the same time so extravagantly one-of-a-kind. He's a genius at pinning down the incongruities of life lived as a peculiar sort of hybrid: a New York Jewish comic who grew up entranced with serious foreign films; a hypochondriac who nevertheless makes film after film in the riskiest and most extroverted branch of show business; a lover of show tunes from an earlier era who regularly plays New Orleans jazz in a New York club. His movies range in tone and ambition from the serio-comic and angst-ridden, to pure frippery, and even a musical. But through them all runs the sweet-sour tune, part romantic, part melancholy, of the phobic but irrepressible artist-lover. </p> <p>We first met in the early 1980s, introduced by mutual friends as we stood on a sidewalk after lunch, and afterwards we walked up Madison Avenue together. Somewhere along the way, we were stopped in our tracks: a group of Hadassah ladies from Philadelphia swooped on him, screaming accusations that he had failed to show up for a scheduled appearance at their club; they had waited for hours! It was a bizarre spectacle - Allen shrinking in terror as the mob erupted in self-righteous indignation. It was straight out of Stardust Memories, that Fellini- esque extravaganza, from 1980, of monster fans and carping critics, and a movie I'd thought shrill and overdone at the time but which now made perfect sense. </p> <p>He comes into the Regency hotel room, looking neat and self-possessed. He has a cold but no thermometer in view (in Wild Man Blues, when he's coming down with a cold, Soon-Yi accuses him of taking his temperature every few minutes, hoping it'll rise). We shake hands warmly, but he looks puzzled. \"What are you doing writing for the Guardian?\" </p> <p>\"They asked me. I'll write an article none of my friends will see. How would you feel about making movies that none of your friends would see?\" </p> <p>\"That's an interesting question.\" He pauses. \"I think I already am.\" </p> <p>I ask him if he remembers the Stardust Memories-like encounter with the Hadassah ladies. \"Oh, yes. They had it wrong. I never accept those things. It had to be some kind of misunderstanding. But yes, Stardust Memories was about all that. It's no exaggeration, well a slight exaggeration. That's really what happens. They come up to you with their different kinds of supplications, and you very often feel for them, but there's nothing you can do.\" </p> <p>\"New Yorkers,\" I say, \"and Jews in particular, feel they own you, you're one of them.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, they did until I wrote a piece for the [New York] Times saying the Israelis shouldn't go from door to door breaking peoples' hands. I thought it was the wrong thing to do, just from the Israeli point of view of giving a propaganda victory to the other side.\" </p> <p>I mention Radio Days, one of my all-time favourite Woody Allen films, and how benign the celebrity game was then. People were so rooted in family and in the fullness of their lives. They watched, or rather listened to, news and gossip from the great world but didn't necessarily want to be part of it, didn't identify so desperately and wholly with stars as today's public do. \"Yes, that's the way it was, that was how I grew up.\" </p> <p>I mention an article I read recently which dissected the mania for celebrities and scandal as a \"mediathon\" and interviewed some of those caught in the meshes, among them Monica Lewinsky, OJ Simpson and Woody Allen. Allen has said memorably that a scandal needs sex to keep going; the Elian Gonzalez saga petered out from lack of it. I tell him I thought OJ sounded like he was in the twilight zone, in denial, railing at the press, probably convinced he never did it, or if he did, she deserved it. I ask Allen if he thinks that someone who has committed murder and got away with it, like the Martin Landau character in Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanours, secretly craves punishment. </p> <p>Allen ducks the implications: \"I don't really know what the story on OJ is. He was found innocent. At first, I couldn't imagine why he didn't just move to London, but he's enjoying life, he has enough money, he plays golf, has friends and, with the passage of time, the heat on that thing drifts away.\" </p> <p>I'd overheard him tell the previous interviewer: \"I understand people may like my films or not like them, not find them funny, dismiss them. But I can't understand why people hate them!\" I ask him about this. </p> <p>\"Yes, I wonder why there should be people who hate me and my films.\" </p> <p>\"Was this even before the scandal?\" </p> <p>\"Before, or even after, I could never figure it out.\" </p> <p>\"Some women I know won't go to your movies since the Soon-Yi episode. The French have a different attitude toward artists, feel they should be exonerated from all sorts of transgressions. As an American and a woman, I have very mixed feelings. We're closer to you and feel involved.\" </p> <p>\"But I never felt artists should be exonerated,\" he says. \"In Interiors, one of the points that I made clearly is that the artist had no special privileges, and that it was a mistake to think that way. We shouldn't cut the artist any more slack than the average person.\" </p> <p>\"You weren't surprised or upset by the explosion?\" </p> <p>\"I was surprised by the size of it. And by the accusation of child molestation, but I felt it was only a question of time before it became clear. I think that was a miscalculation by Mia's camp. She shouldn't have tried that ploy because it was doomed to failure. The one she should have tried was the one that was ultimately more successful and that was, 'This person did a terrible thing to me and I trusted him and he made off with my daughter from under my nose'; which is not really what happened. But that was the one that had the total sell and ultimately did better for her. She shouldn't have wasted time with the first one...\" </p> <p>I'm fascinated by the way he has distanced himself by converting the whole thing into a question of legal and public relations strategy. In this, as in so many things, he's a figure of our times, emblematic of an era of confessional art - movies, memoirs, autobiographical novels - in which artists must, in order to keep going, distance themselves from, even disavow, the personal implications. With male artists in particular (see also Roth and Bellow), it seems that a certain amount of turnover and betrayal is inevitable: as if the life must be churned up periodically to get the juices going, to flush out the old and bring up new material, new combinations of old themes. </p> <p>A high-profile custody battle has the additional consequence of immediately entering the public realm, where it is the lawyers and the tabloids rather than the individuals involved who define the terms. The original \"facts\" (ambiguous at best) and emotions (complex and mixed) are twisted, amplified, suppressed, exaggerated, transformed into a simplified high-stakes confrontation which unfolds according to \"how it plays\". He reiterates: \"The false accusations of child molestation was the wrong thing for her. It was a much more winning situation on the emotional side, saying, 'My God, here's someone I trusted and he stole my ungrateful daughter out from under my nose.' It's a long story and that was not really exactly what happened. </p> <p>\"I did think, amusingly at the time, it was the beginning of a very good movie where someone walks into a lawyer's office and says, 'Hey, you've gotta take this case. I'm being accused of running off with my girlfriend's daughter and she's adopted and...' The cards were so stacked that it would have been funny. I can see that scene, the lawyer says, 'OK, I'll take the case but it's not going to be easy.'\" </p> <p>I say I do believe that artists should be given a little slack, since the best of them goes into their work - as he makes us see so movingly in Sweet and Lowdown, when Sean Penn's miserable, drunken, irritating bad boy guitarist sits down to play and the most beautiful music comes forth. </p> <p>\"But why would your girlfriends never see my movies?\" he asks in genuine astonishment. </p> <p>\"Because they feel betrayed. That you should - what you said - make off with your girlfriend's daughter! A woman's worst nightmare. Also, they, we, had maybe romanticised your relationship, seen as idyllic you on one side of the park, she on the other, each with his/her own space.\" </p> <p>\"Why was that their dream of a good relationship? I would question that,\" he says. \"I would think there's something not quite kosher there. Why do they need to have that degree of separation?\" </p> <p>\"You're right about that,\" I agree, and we talk of those \"idyllic\" open relationships that work till one person wants more freedom than the other. \"There's also,\" I add, \"the sense of closeness we feel to you, one of us again. There's no distance.\" </p> <p>\"No distance,\" he repeats, and after a moment, \"I've always benefited from that and suffered from it.\" </p> <p>\"Well for one thing, there's all the great women you've had in your films.\" </p> <p>He reels them off: Diane Keaton, Meryl Streep, Anjelica Huston, Goldie Hawn, Barbara Hershey, Mia, Dianne Wiest, Charlize Theron, Samantha Morton, and Tracey Ullman and Elaine May in the new film and, in the one he's shooting now, Helen Hunt. \"Why is it that big-name stars always want to work with you, and for very little money?\" </p> <p>\"Actually, that's something of a press myth. I definitely get my share of turndowns, mostly men. I wasn't able to get George C Scott, Redford, Nicholson, Hoffman. They say they want to work with me, so I send them a script. They'll say great, but when they find out how low the money is, they say no.\" </p> <p>\"Are they afraid their status, or their value will go down? Or is it that they think they want to be part of an ensemble, but they really don't?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know. I've heard one theory that actors have a problem emotionally because they have some kind of contempt for their job and it comes out here.\" </p> <p>\"But Sean Penn was game.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, and that surprised me. I'd tried to get him before and he'd said no, so I took a chance and sent him the script of Sweet and Lowdown, and he agreed to do it. Even learned to play the guitar.\" </p> <p>He's not a director who explores a woman's point of view; there's too much tension between his protagonists and the women he pursues, the anxiety of the sexual loser - his persona, or that of his surrogate - as a would-be Don Juan. His vision of women is that of a man who desires rather than identifies, yet they are never pure objects, but idiosyncratic, shaped by the talent and personalities of the actresses themselves within an atmosphere of directorial freedom. </p> <p>He brags about Dianne Wiest. \"All I did was give her two roles to play, both of which won Academy awards for her - but based on her natural gifts. I never have to do anything with her.\" And Helen Hunt, in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, the comedy he's finishing now? \"She's wonderful. She comes in with all these ideas about the character, which always amazes me.\" </p> <p>\"Do you like that?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, if they don't bother me with it.\" </p> <p>\"You don't want to have a seminar on it?\" </p> <p>\"No, because I have nothing to add. I can look at it and say if it's right or wrong, I can't think abstractly.\" </p> <p>\"And Tracey Ullman and Elaine May?\" </p> <p>\"I'd used Tracey before, in Bullets Over Broadway, and cut her out of Everyone Says I Love You. I wanted to use her again, and was lucky to get Elaine May, who's very elusive. I said to someone, 'There are not many great comics of any description, and here I am working with two female comic geniuses - can I hold my own?'\" </p> <p>\"In Small Time Crooks, you play a mug, like those character actors in Warner Brothers comic crime capers of the 1940s. Is that the first time?\" </p> <p>\"Unless you count Broadway Danny Rose or Take the Money and Run. I can't act; I can only play two things. I can play a bookworm, an intellectual - though of course I'm not - because I look it, I have an eyeglasses look, like I've worn my eyes out reading. And I can play a lowlife. The funny part of it is, that's closer to me. I don't mean to be self-deprecating, but the truth is that I'm happiest at home with a beer, watching the Knicks, watching the Mets and the Yankees. I would have made a good housewife. I like the idea of getting up in the morning, making breakfast, watching television. I was going to do a film last spring, and then Sweetland Films [the production company behind all his feature films since Mighty Aphrodite in 1995] and I parted company, and for about four months before I got involved again I would just do that, get up and make breakfast and watch television.\" </p> <p>\"Weren't you full of anxiety?\" </p> <p>\"No, but I would have been if there weren't something quickly in the offing.\" </p> <p>\"Were you making notes? Assuming?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, I assumed there was going to be another film. I did two film scripts, two pieces for the New Yorker, but I didn't have to. It was just a treat that suddenly at 10 o'clock in the morning I'd come upon The Killers with Burt Lancaster and just be able to watch it.\" </p> <p>I ask about The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. \"I had accumulated three or four ideas over the years that were just comic, and I wanted to get them done. Crooks was one, the one I'm doing now [it's three weeks from end of shooting] and one more after that. Then I'll get back to more serious projects.\" </p> <p>\"I thought Samantha Morton, as Sean Penn's mute girlfriend in Sweet and Lowdown, was amazing. How did that come about?\" </p> <p>\"I saw her in a clip and was amazed. She had a face like a silent film star [a role she assumes briefly in the movie]. She came over, she'd certainly never heard of me. I told her I wanted this character played like Harpo Marx. She'd never heard of him either - she'd grown up in an orphanage for a while. She went back, studied the Marx Brothers movies and when she came to do the part, she acted like Harpo Marx. I said I don't simply want you to do Harpo Marx, it's that quality.\" </p> <p> She is extraordinary in the movie, her face communicating as much or more than any voice could do - transport, jealousy, passion, pride. She's an amalgam of Woody women, sometimes a forlorn, stubborn, wistful reminder of Mia, sometimes of the adoring new \"foreign\" ingenue in Woody's life. I was a fan of Everyone Says I Love You and wonder if he'll ever do another musical. He says he would love to do another musical with someone writing the score, book and lyrics, the kind written by Lerner, or Kern, or Porter - not a contemporary score. </p> <p>\"The thing that kills me is the change in music over the years, and the fact that young people have absolutely no feeling for the music I love. That's the most crucial, the most detrimental, thing that's happened in show business or in culture in my lifetime. The change in music from the tunes of the 1920s to the 1940s is on a continuum, but once you get into the 1960s, there is no correlation between music as I know it and the blasting of electric guitars, concerts that are nothing but electronic noise with audiences jumping and screaming. It's getting high, but on something that's not musical. It's sexual, I guess, but not romantic.\" </p> <p>On this sad note our talk comes to a close. We're going up Madison together - he's now living in my neighbourhood - but it's too far to walk and he has a cold, so we take a cab. The driver, a burly, gregarious black man from the Caribbean, lights up when he recognises his passenger and immediately passes something back for Woody to sign. It has the driver's son's picture on it, and Woody accedes to the proud father's request. </p> <p>\"This is the best thing that's happened to me all day,\" the cabbie says. </p> <p>\"Well that must have been a pretty bad day,\" Woody murmurs, feeling more anguish than joy that he, this sniffling neurotic wreck of an artist, represents the high spot of someone's day. </p> <p>He seems remarkably calm, these days, easier with people - you can see it in the documentary. He's moved out of the apartment on Fifth Avenue and is living in a townhouse with Soon-Yi and their two children. But old fears persist. \"At first I was afraid,\" he says as we ride uptown, \"that without a doorman someone would break in at night and murder me in my sleep. Now I wish they would.\" </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"There are 17 guys doing renovation work in the house, all the time. It's driving me crazy. I wish someone would murder me. Put me out of my misery.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Small Time Crooks is released next Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A three-room suite at New York's Regency hotel has been booked for the weekend so that the foreign press can interview Woody Allen for the European opening of Small Time Crooks. When I arrive on Saturday, the video cameras are whirring, journalists are stacked in orderly fashion like planes waiting for take-off at La Guardia, and a variety of accents can be heard as questions technical and metaphysical are volleyed across the language barrier and answers are graciously batted back. I'm reminded of the scene in Notting Hill where Julia Roberts is being interviewed by representatives of any and every publication, from the most illustrious to the most obscure - the funniest and most far-fetched being Horse and Hound's Hugh Grant. As reporters clamber over each other for a moment with the Hollywood diva, Grant tries to convince her of her importance to the fox-hunting and steeplechasing set. Allen's rapport with the European press is a love-fest - rather more so than is the case with American journalists. The French, the English, the Italians adore him unreservedly and, as someone points out in Wild Man Blues, Barbara Kopple's affecting 1997 documentary about his jazz tour of Europe, his films are greeted and loved there as equals, all of the same stature. In America, some are hits, some are flops. Critics draw sharp distinctions among them. \"Maybe they gain something in translation,\" he says wryly. His wife Soon-Yi, who accompanied him on the Wild Man Blues tour, confesses disarmingly she didn't much like Interiors. She was very young, she blushes, and found it tedious. \"So did the American critics,\" he hastens to assure her. And when Soon-Yi, emboldened, adds that \"it drones on and on\", Woody replies that Europeans like films that drone on and on. It's that gift for self-mockery, a razor-sharp appreciation of life and his own neuroses - even as he is struggling in their vice-like grip - that makes him at once so endearingly contemporary and at the same time so extravagantly one-of-a-kind. He's a genius at pinning down the incongruities of life lived as a peculiar sort of hybrid: a New York Jewish comic who grew up entranced with serious foreign films; a hypochondriac who nevertheless makes film after film in the riskiest and most extroverted branch of show business; a lover of show tunes from an earlier era who regularly plays New Orleans jazz in a New York club. His movies range in tone and ambition from the serio-comic and angst-ridden, to pure frippery, and even a musical. But through them all runs the sweet-sour tune, part romantic, part melancholy, of the phobic but irrepressible artist-lover. We first met in the early 1980s, introduced by mutual friends as we stood on a sidewalk after lunch, and afterwards we walked up Madison Avenue together. Somewhere along the way, we were stopped in our tracks: a group of Hadassah ladies from Philadelphia swooped on him, screaming accusations that he had failed to show up for a scheduled appearance at their club; they had waited for hours! It was a bizarre spectacle - Allen shrinking in terror as the mob erupted in self-righteous indignation. It was straight out of Stardust Memories, that Fellini- esque extravaganza, from 1980, of monster fans and carping critics, and a movie I'd thought shrill and overdone at the time but which now made perfect sense. He comes into the Regency hotel room, looking neat and self-possessed. He has a cold but no thermometer in view (in Wild Man Blues, when he's coming down with a cold, Soon-Yi accuses him of taking his temperature every few minutes, hoping it'll rise). We shake hands warmly, but he looks puzzled. \"What are you doing writing for the Guardian?\" \"They asked me. I'll write an article none of my friends will see. How would you feel about making movies that none of your friends would see?\" \"That's an interesting question.\" He pauses. \"I think I already am.\" I ask him if he remembers the Stardust Memories-like encounter with the Hadassah ladies. \"Oh, yes. They had it wrong. I never accept those things. It had to be some kind of misunderstanding. But yes, Stardust Memories was about all that. It's no exaggeration, well a slight exaggeration. That's really what happens. They come up to you with their different kinds of supplications, and you very often feel for them, but there's nothing you can do.\" \"New Yorkers,\" I say, \"and Jews in particular, feel they own you, you're one of them.\" \"Yeah, they did until I wrote a piece for the [New York] Times saying the Israelis shouldn't go from door to door breaking peoples' hands. I thought it was the wrong thing to do, just from the Israeli point of view of giving a propaganda victory to the other side.\" I mention Radio Days, one of my all-time favourite Woody Allen films, and how benign the celebrity game was then. People were so rooted in family and in the fullness of their lives. They watched, or rather listened to, news and gossip from the great world but didn't necessarily want to be part of it, didn't identify so desperately and wholly with stars as today's public do. \"Yes, that's the way it was, that was how I grew up.\" I mention an article I read recently which dissected the mania for celebrities and scandal as a \"mediathon\" and interviewed some of those caught in the meshes, among them Monica Lewinsky, OJ Simpson and Woody Allen. Allen has said memorably that a scandal needs sex to keep going; the Elian Gonzalez saga petered out from lack of it. I tell him I thought OJ sounded like he was in the twilight zone, in denial, railing at the press, probably convinced he never did it, or if he did, she deserved it. I ask Allen if he thinks that someone who has committed murder and got away with it, like the Martin Landau character in Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanours, secretly craves punishment. Allen ducks the implications: \"I don't really know what the story on OJ is. He was found innocent. At first, I couldn't imagine why he didn't just move to London, but he's enjoying life, he has enough money, he plays golf, has friends and, with the passage of time, the heat on that thing drifts away.\" I'd overheard him tell the previous interviewer: \"I understand people may like my films or not like them, not find them funny, dismiss them. But I can't understand why people hate them!\" I ask him about this. \"Yes, I wonder why there should be people who hate me and my films.\" \"Was this even before the scandal?\" \"Before, or even after, I could never figure it out.\" \"Some women I know won't go to your movies since the Soon-Yi episode.

It has the driver's son's picture on it, and Woody accedes to the proud father's request. \"This is the best thing that's happened to me all day,\" the cabbie says. \"Well that must have been a pretty bad day,\" Woody murmurs, feeling more anguish than joy that he, this sniffling neurotic wreck of an artist, represents the high spot of someone's day. He seems remarkably calm, these days, easier with people - you can see it in the documentary. He's moved out of the apartment on Fifth Avenue and is living in a townhouse with Soon-Yi and their two children. But old fears persist. \"At first I was afraid,\" he says as we ride uptown, \"that without a doorman someone would break in at night and murder me in my sleep. Now I wish they would.\" \"Why?\" \"There are 17 guys doing renovation work in the house, all the time. It's driving me crazy. I wish someone would murder me. Put me out of my misery.\" \u0095 Small Time Crooks is released next Friday.",

It wasn't what the publicist wanted to hear, but the word among the cool under-10s is that Pok\u00e9mon has peaked. Question is, can the movie give Pikachu and his funny little friends a new lease of life?</p> <p> Ironically, the new offering is a lot better than its predecessor, Pok\u00e9mon The First Movie. \"There's just a lot more to it,\" said Charlie, 10. \"More action, and great graphics - the way the river flowed was amazing. And the music was excellent too. I really liked it - and I don't even like Pok\u00e9mon.\"</p> <p> The new movie sees the screen debut of six Pok\u00e9mon characters, and at times the screen is awash with endless varieties of the creatures. \"There definitely seemed to be more Pok\u00e9mon in this film than the first one,\" said Joe, eight. Like the first film, the new release is two movies in one - a short and sweet, dialogue-free explosion of colour entitled Pikachu's Rescue Adventure followed by The Power of One, in which Ash, the hero of the first movie, has to save the planet from metereological destruction. </p> <p>Sounds familiar? \"It was a bit of a coincidence that it was all about the weather having gone out of control,\" said Rosie Smith, eight. \"I think some people who watch it will probably be reminded of the last few weeks here.\" But in Pok\u00e9mon 2000, it's not greenhouse gases which have caused the crisis, it's the big baddie Lawrence III, a Pok\u00e9mon collector who wants to capture the birds Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno in the hope of luring the even more prized Lugia, a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon who lives beneath the ocean waves. The birds, however, control earth's meterological balance, so the evil plan puts the planet at risk.</p> <p> The plot got a definite thumbs-up. \"The story is much better than the first movie,\" said Kirsty. \"There was lots more to it, but not so much that you couldn't follow what was going on. There were lots of smaller plots inside the main story, which made the whole thing more interesting and gave you more to get your teeth into.\"</p> <p> Nathan Goodman, nine, particularly liked the evil Lawrence III. \"He was a good character - I liked how bad he was, and when he was talking he spoke in a very calm voice which made him seem very realistic. That's how people talk when they are being very bad.\" Sam Walker's favourite bit was \"when they read a poem about the world turning to ash and realised that it meant that Ash the boy had to save them all\".</p> <p> The moral of the tale is that even a kid can make a difference. \"It was saying that if you want to try something, you should go ahead - even if the chances don't look that good, that you'll succeed,\" said Charlie. \"It was also telling you about how much you mean to your parents, because at the end Ash's mum says if she'd lost him, she'd have lost her whole world.\" </p> <p>So will the movie bring their friends back to the craze? \"I think it will - if they come to see it,\" said Kirsty. \"It's lots of fun, and it does make Pok\u00e9mon seem exciting again.\"<br>\u0095 Opens Dec 22. </p> <p> <strong>The Grinch</strong><br> Kids' rating: 8/10<br> Parents' rating: 6/10<br> Dir: Ron Howard<br> 105 mins<br> Cert PG<br></p> <p> Jim Carrey is a hairy, pea-green monster called the Grinch in a movie which was a bit of a trial for the parents in our party, but a hit with the kids.</p> <p> Basically, the story (courtesy of Dr Seuss of Cat in the Hat fame) is that the Grinch hates Christmas, and this year, he decides he's finally had enough and is going to pull the plug on the seasonal pig-out planned by the weird inhabitants of his nearest town, Whoville. But he's stopped in his tracks by Cindy Lou, who refuses to believe that even someone terrifying as the Grinch doesn't have a bit of goodness hidden somewhere under all that nastiness.</p> <p> The Grinch parodies our overblown, over commercialised Christmas and finds it wanting, which should be a good idea although the moral gets a bit lost in a sea of snow and slush. But the kids seemed to get it: \"It taught you a lesson, that Christmas things aren't what matter, it's the people you are with. You don't need presents to make a good Christmas,\" said Joe Walker, aged eight. And Kirsty O'Donnell, 10, noticed something else: \"It was trying to get you to think that you shouldn't just judge people by what you see on the outside. The Grinch isn't very likeable and a lot of people would have given up on him but Cindy Lou doesn't and that's what brings him round.\"</p> <p> Like all the best scary monsters, the Grinch lives on his own on the top of a steep mountain, so a big chase down the hillside on a sledge is inevitable. \"I really loved the action bit where the Grinch and Cindy Lou sleighed down the mountain,\" said 10-year-old Charlie d'Auria. \"It wasn't really frightening but it was very fast and you almost felt like you were on the sledge with them sometimes.\"</p> <p> The Grinch himself was deemed a suitably awful character, at least in his pre-reformed state. \"He was great - really funny,\" said Kirsty. \"He loved causing chaos so much, he was so bad, and you knew that whenever he turned up, all sorts of things were going to go wrong, like when all the cars crashed into one another in Whoville.\"</p> <p> Eleanor Wittet, nine, liked it best when the Grinch dressed up as Santa Claus and went on his own Christmas Eve spree down people's chimneys. \"He was stealing all the presents instead of leaving them there.\"</p> <p> Joe thought the film scored best on its visual appeal. \"It was hard to believe that the Grinch was a real actor underneath all that make-up,\" he said. \"Also, the scenery and the way the Grinch's house was shown, with lots of gadgets and things, was really good.\"<br>\u0095 Opens Dec 1.</p> <p><strong>Merlin: The Return</strong><br>Kids' rating: 9/10 Parents' rating: 8/10<br> Dir: Paul Matthews<br> 88 mins<br> Cert PG<br></p> <p> If you've got a nine-year-old boy to entertain during the Christmas holidays, you aren't going to regret a trip to the cinema to see Merlin: The Return. \"Absolutely brilliant,\" said Joseph Hand, nine. \"There was loads going on, lots of sudden action, and a good story with plenty of surprises.

But Merlin, played by Rik Mayall, is on hand to do battle with him again, as he did in the past when he managed to banish him to the netherworld. Whether he can do so this time depends on whether young Richie, who has come to live in Britain after the death of his father, can do enough to help him.</p> <p> \"You just never know what's going to happen next,\" said nine-year-old Matthew Deacon. \"Also, the action starts right at the beginning - one thing I don't like about some films is that people are just talking for the first 15 or 30 minutes. It's scary - in fact it's so scary I'm quite surprised it got a PG certificate. The storyline is really exciting and keeps you guessing, and though there is some swordfighting there isn't much violence where you actually see someone harmed.\"</p> <p> James Robertson, nine, said he thought he'd find the story hard to follow at the beginning of the film, but he soon got it sorted out. \"I think it helped to know a bit about the history of King Arthur and to understand who people like Queen Guinevere were,\" he said. \"I recognised Rik Mayall and he was really good as Merlin. He was a perfect person to play him.\"</p> <p> Mordred, played by Craig Sheffer, was another character who came in for comment. \"He was a very bad man, but in some ways, he was almost like a child in his tantrums and his behaviour,\" said Rosie, eight. \"I liked it but I did find it a bit hard to follow at times, especially because it was moving between the olden days and the time we're living in now.\"<br>\u0095 Opens Dec 22.</p> <p> <strong>102 Dalmatians</strong><br> Kids' rating: 8/10<br> Parents' rating: 7/10<br> Dir: Kevin Lima<br> 100 mins<br> Cert U (tbc)<br> </p> <p> Walt Disney have added precisely one dalmatian puppy to their hit of 1996.

Here they are in a 21st-century version of the small-screen Angels: the three gorgeous secret agents who do the bidding of \"Charlie\", an unseen, fatherly presence who prefers to make contact through the medium of a museum-piece 1970s speakerphone. </p> <p>Cameron, Lucy and Drew show us their moves. They show us what they've got.

(Not surprising that Lucy Liu, like Robert De Niro before her, found working with the great man a little trying.) But writers Russell Carpenter, Ryan Rowe and Ed Solomon don't solely entrust Bill with the gags.

For me, on the contrary, this week saw a reminder of why I was once attracted to what might as well be called Thatcherism.</p> <p>Twenty-two years is a long time in politics, but one of yesterday's byelections, in Glasgow Anniesland, brought back vivid memories. It was caused by the death of Donald Dewar, who returned to parliament in 1978 by winning this seat, then known as Garscadden, in a byelection. Covering it had a profound effect on me. What was unforgettable - shattering even - wasn't the contest, or the quiet, couthy Dewar, it was the place.</p> <p>At that time, Garscadden held a record among constituencies in Britain for the proportion of its inhabitants living in council dwellings: 96%. And what dwellings. It was a prime example of an \"inner-outer suburb\" which had been knocked down and rebuilt by municipal planners. A great forest of tower blocks had been erected in the 1960s, though many were dirty and decaying by the end of the next decade. It might have been Magnitogorsk.</p> <p>In that great age of social engineering, the poor of central Glasgow had been siphoned out of their old tenements and decanted into these blocks. This had happened throughout the country, but nowhere was it done more thoroughly than in central Scotland, under Labour's mighty municipal one-party statelet. There were plenty of other places nearly as bad as Garscadden, but few worse. I don't think anywhere had depressed me more, or made me want to live there less.</p> <p>At the time of that byelection, the Labour party was approaching a crisis. The following year the Callaghan government was to fall, ushering in 18 years of Tory rule. Plenty of prominent Labour supporters had abandoned the party, or were about to. Some would move far to the right, while others left three years later to form the SDP. These defectors had, or gave, varying reasons for their defection - union power, the rise of a Trotskyist left, Europe, nuclear multilateralism.</p> <p>What no one ever said was that there might have been something fundamentally wrong with the whole spirit of Labour rule, in national or local government. That spirit wasn't a revolutionary dream of hope, or Marx's kingdom of freedom, or any brand of libertarian socialism (which has always been at a discount in this country). It was Fabian managerialism: the belief that the gentleman in Whitehall - or the Scottish Labour apparatchik - really does know what is good for people better than the people themselves.</p> <p>There was a time when, seen in a favourable light, Margaret Thatcher looked as if she defied that spirit and spoke for a new mood of individual freedom and responsibility. Maybe that was an illusion, though if her government had done nothing else it should be honoured for selling council houses and trying to break up those vast, awful Soviet estates.</p> <p>Then again, maybe there was a similar illusion about Blair's \"modernising\". He got rid of Sidney Webb's clause four, and Labour no longer pretends that it wants to secure for the workers by hand and by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof (a sentence which Blair the moderniser, or rebrander, replaced with something much less lucid and comprehensible).</p> <p>But it was the great managerialist Webb who, on another occasion, summed up the social philosophy with which he wanted to imbue Labour in less inspiring but all too accurate words: \"The perfect and fitting development of each individual is not necessarily the utmost and highest cultivation of his own personality, but the filling, in the best possible way, of his humble function in the great social machine.\" That was the spirit in which Labour once ruled, and that was how Garscadden was run.</p> <p>In the early days when he kissed the Iron Handbag, Blair lauded \"the Thatcher-Reagan leadership\" of the 1980s in his usual verb-starved prose. It had \"got certain things right. A greater emphasis on enterprise. Rewarding not penalising success. Breaking up vested interests.\" What he never said, while he apostrophised wealth creation in this vulgar way, was whether he truly wanted to leave behind \"the great social machine\" humbly served by an inert populace. I am not sure that he has told us since.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wheaty@compuserve.com\">wheaty@compuserve.com</a></p>",

Perhaps the prime minister really has now at last discarded Lady Thatcher and her ism with his angry attack on Wednesday, which brought such cheer to old Labour. For me, on the contrary, this week saw a reminder of why I was once attracted to what might as well be called Thatcherism. Twenty-two years is a long time in politics, but one of yesterday's byelections, in Glasgow Anniesland, brought back vivid memories. It was caused by the death of Donald Dewar, who returned to parliament in 1978 by winning this seat, then known as Garscadden, in a byelection. Covering it had a profound effect on me. What was unforgettable - shattering even - wasn't the contest, or the quiet, couthy Dewar, it was the place. At that time, Garscadden held a record among constituencies in Britain for the proportion of its inhabitants living in council dwellings: 96%. And what dwellings. It was a prime example of an \"inner-outer suburb\" which had been knocked down and rebuilt by municipal planners. A great forest of tower blocks had been erected in the 1960s, though many were dirty and decaying by the end of the next decade. It might have been Magnitogorsk. In that great age of social engineering, the poor of central Glasgow had been siphoned out of their old tenements and decanted into these blocks. This had happened throughout the country, but nowhere was it done more thoroughly than in central Scotland, under Labour's mighty municipal one-party statelet. There were plenty of other places nearly as bad as Garscadden, but few worse. I don't think anywhere had depressed me more, or made me want to live there less. At the time of that byelection, the Labour party was approaching a crisis. The following year the Callaghan government was to fall, ushering in 18 years of Tory rule. Plenty of prominent Labour supporters had abandoned the party, or were about to. Some would move far to the right, while others left three years later to form the SDP. These defectors had, or gave, varying reasons for their defection - union power, the rise of a Trotskyist left, Europe, nuclear multilateralism. What no one ever said was that there might have been something fundamentally wrong with the whole spirit of Labour rule, in national or local government. That spirit wasn't a revolutionary dream of hope, or Marx's kingdom of freedom, or any brand of libertarian socialism (which has always been at a discount in this country). It was Fabian managerialism: the belief that the gentleman in Whitehall - or the Scottish Labour apparatchik - really does know what is good for people better than the people themselves. There was a time when, seen in a favourable light, Margaret Thatcher looked as if she defied that spirit and spoke for a new mood of individual freedom and responsibility. Maybe that was an illusion, though if her government had done nothing else it should be honoured for selling council houses and trying to break up those vast, awful Soviet estates. Then again, maybe there was a similar illusion about Blair's \"modernising\". He got rid of Sidney Webb's clause four, and Labour no longer pretends that it wants to secure for the workers by hand and by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof (a sentence which Blair the moderniser, or rebrander, replaced with something much less lucid and comprehensible). But it was the great managerialist Webb who, on another occasion, summed up the social philosophy with which he wanted to imbue Labour in less inspiring but all too accurate words: \"The perfect and fitting development of each individual is not necessarily the utmost and highest cultivation of his own personality, but the filling, in the best possible way, of his humble function in the great social machine.\" That was the spirit in which Labour once ruled, and that was how Garscadden was run. In the early days when he kissed the Iron Handbag, Blair lauded \"the Thatcher-Reagan leadership\" of the 1980s in his usual verb-starved prose. It had \"got certain things right. A greater emphasis on enterprise. Rewarding not penalising success. Breaking up vested interests.\" What he never said, while he apostrophised wealth creation in this vulgar way, was whether he truly wanted to leave behind \"the great social machine\" humbly served by an inert populace. I am not sure that he has told us since. wheaty@compuserve.com",

Widening his attack from the single issue of British participation in a so-called \"European army\", the prime minister complained in cabinet that the right's reluctance to accept the legitimacy of a Labour government meant it would target \"anyone who works in public service\" for Labour. The fact that Mr Blair and his cabinet colleagues expressed particular outrage over a Daily Mail character assassination of Britain's senior serving soldier during their weekly meeting was less significant than the decision to publicise the prime minister's remarks within an hour. Angered in particular by yesterday's Mail article headlined \"Tony's crony general who kept his head below the parapet\", Mr Blair protested that Gen Guthrie, a former SAS soldier with a fearsome reputation in the field, had served both Labour and Tory governments \"with absolute distinction\". After the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, described Gen Guthrie as \"a first-class professional soldier who has never been afraid to give first-class advice\" and the international development secretary, Clare Short, spoke up in a similar way, Mr Blair went significantly further. In a rehearsal for the coming election campaign he said: \"The problem with the right is that they cannot accept there's a Labour government and they will attack anyone who works in public service under a Labour government. It's quite disgraceful, totally unwarranted and evidence of their utter desperation.\" In the argument over the government's commitment of 12,500 British troops to a future EU rapid reaction force (RRF) for peacekeeping purposes, Mr Blair received a significant boost when the former Tory chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, intervened to back Labour. Conservative opposition was thrown into disarray when the pro-European Tory told parliament the RRF was something the party had worked to achieve when it was in power. Mr Clarke said: \"The last government ... embarked on a process of evolving Nato towards a different shape that also involved strengthening the European element.\" Amid ironical cheers from the Labour side he explained: \"I regard yesterday's announcement as the latest stage in quite a protracted process that has been going on of deciding how Nato should be shaped in future.\" That amounted to a \"slightly different\" recollection of events from that expressed by John Major 24 hours earlier, when he called the RRF \"a misconceived political proposal that should never have been made\".

      "body": "<p>It's not just the end of a session; we're coming to the end of the parliament. MPs become obsessed with one topic, their own re-election. You can see their interest in events in the chamber drizzle away. Their minds are in their constituencies. Back at the coalface, things become faintly surrealist, slightly unexpected, curiously weird.</p> <p>Take Theresa May's footwear. The Tory education spokeswoman was wearing glossy black shoes so pointed that the old term winklepickers cannot do them justice. If you sterilised them you could perform keyhole surgery, from the far side of the operating theatre. I've never seen such shoes, except on the wicked witch in a panto, or the windows of specialist shops in Soho.</p> <p>Famously, Ms May is sometimes confused with her near namesake, the \"glamour model\" Teresa May. Perhaps the two are in the process of merging their personalities. On the starlet's website I found many pictures of her wearing unusual shoes, though there was very little educational material, at least in a political sense; I found nothing like: \"'time to assess new LEA funding levels with respect to special educational needs,' says lovely, pouting Teresa May, who likes meeting people and romantic fireside evenings with Chris Woodhead\".</p> <p>Actually Mr Woodhead cropped up several times at education questions yesterday. The Tories are pretty sure that David Blunkett couldn't stand him, but was forced to keep him on by Tony Blair. \"Were you very disappointed,\" asked David Ruffley in a silky voice, \"to see Mr Woodhead resign?\"</p> <p>Mr Blunkett hummed and hawed and finally found a formula which almost an swered the question without actually fibbing. \"Chris Woodhead and I have been through a great deal together,\" he said (you could say the same of Tom and Jerry), \"therefore, having recently been responsible for his reappointment, I was very disappointed.\"</p> <p>\"So that's a 'no', then!\" the jubilant Tories yelled back.</p> <p>Next I pondered why education questions are infested with jargon. I'm always suspicious of New Labour when they start to talk in breeze-block phrases and capital letters. It means that someone has taken a real problem and turned it into a committee or a project or a roll-out or a strategy, which may or may not engage the problem in the end, but is certainly no substitute for a solution.</p> <p>So yesterday we learned of \"threshold assessments\"; \"pupil-progress targets\"; the \"national input league table\"; the \"environmental task force option\" and the \"changed system to income-contingent loans basis\". Oh, and somebody is working on a \"longitudinal study,\" and an \"inclusion project to identify best practice\", whatever they might be.</p> <p>Does it matter? I think it does. So often this government confuses decision with achievement, proposals with accomplishments.

      "bodyText": "It's not just the end of a session; we're coming to the end of the parliament. MPs become obsessed with one topic, their own re-election. You can see their interest in events in the chamber drizzle away. Their minds are in their constituencies. Back at the coalface, things become faintly surrealist, slightly unexpected, curiously weird. Take Theresa May's footwear. The Tory education spokeswoman was wearing glossy black shoes so pointed that the old term winklepickers cannot do them justice. If you sterilised them you could perform keyhole surgery, from the far side of the operating theatre. I've never seen such shoes, except on the wicked witch in a panto, or the windows of specialist shops in Soho. Famously, Ms May is sometimes confused with her near namesake, the \"glamour model\" Teresa May. Perhaps the two are in the process of merging their personalities. On the starlet's website I found many pictures of her wearing unusual shoes, though there was very little educational material, at least in a political sense; I found nothing like: \"'time to assess new LEA funding levels with respect to special educational needs,' says lovely, pouting Teresa May, who likes meeting people and romantic fireside evenings with Chris Woodhead\". Actually Mr Woodhead cropped up several times at education questions yesterday. The Tories are pretty sure that David Blunkett couldn't stand him, but was forced to keep him on by Tony Blair. \"Were you very disappointed,\" asked David Ruffley in a silky voice, \"to see Mr Woodhead resign?\" Mr Blunkett hummed and hawed and finally found a formula which almost an swered the question without actually fibbing. \"Chris Woodhead and I have been through a great deal together,\" he said (you could say the same of Tom and Jerry), \"therefore, having recently been responsible for his reappointment, I was very disappointed.\" \"So that's a 'no', then!\" the jubilant Tories yelled back. Next I pondered why education questions are infested with jargon. I'm always suspicious of New Labour when they start to talk in breeze-block phrases and capital letters. It means that someone has taken a real problem and turned it into a committee or a project or a roll-out or a strategy, which may or may not engage the problem in the end, but is certainly no substitute for a solution. So yesterday we learned of \"threshold assessments\"; \"pupil-progress targets\"; the \"national input league table\"; the \"environmental task force option\" and the \"changed system to income-contingent loans basis\". Oh, and somebody is working on a \"longitudinal study,\" and an \"inclusion project to identify best practice\", whatever they might be. Does it matter? I think it does. So often this government confuses decision with achievement, proposals with accomplishments. These grand, intangible phrases are hopes and dreams given fine names, but little more. Later Margaret Hodge produced a wonderfully bonkers moment. James Clappison, a Tory, asked her whether class sizes were \"higher or lower in 1979, or now? Higher, or lower?\" he demanded. She drew herself up to her full height (just below the dispatch box). \"The answer to that question is yes!\" she barked, her certainty matched only by the utter meaninglessness of the reply. But the most marvellously mad moment came later in the Europe debate when Kenneth Clarke, the fomer chancellor, was cheered to the roof by Labour MPs for declaring that the new Euro reaction force was a product and an aim of Tory policy.

Rather than contrasting the faith citizens have in national governments with that in the European Union, it may be more appropriate to conceive of a spectrum of distrust of politicians wherever they are located. The level of distrust has been rising in both Europe and America for a long time. In 1960 three out of four Americans agreed that politicians in Washington could be trusted; by the 1990s three out of four agreed they could not be trusted.</p> <p>The question would-be reformers have to ask themselves, of course, is whether political disillusion is a product of the misbehaviour of politicians or of the malfunctioning of constitutional arrangments, or whether it has deeper causes. The work of Robert D Putnam, whose studies of civic engagement began in Italy, where he described profound differences between the north and south, and continued in the United States, suggest that political disillusion is a function of a general shift away from almost every form of social connection, from playing bridge or entertaining at home to going to meetings or standing for office.</p> <p>Social capital, the accumulation of habits and attitudes that build trust in economic and political life and which, among other things, school people in democracy, has accordingly diminished, he argues in his book, Bowling Alone. The causes he assigns, in various tentative proportions, to generational change, television, suburban sprawl, and new ways of working. Others have examined some of these changes in many countries, as the prevalence of the term \"civic society\" indicates.

It was this generation which maintained community in American neighbourhoods through a thick web of social connections and sustained churches, charitable organisations, veterans' bodies, business groups, sporting clubs, and political parties.</p> <p>As they pass from the scene, all these suffer or are transmuted into associations that may have huge \"memberships\" but which are, in fact, professionally led advocacy organisations, whose members contribute only money. Political parties come to depend more on paid staff rather than unpaid volunteers and active members, and more on advertising and media management rather than on citizens attempting to convince one another. It is not at all clear, Putnam adds, that the hopes that the internet will supply some of these deficiencies will be justified.</p> <p>Putnam is editing a book which examines trends in European and other countries. The picture, he says, is one of a continent not yet \"exhibiting anything like the same dramatic decline\" but nevertheless moving in a similar direction. \"On some core features of civic society - religious involvment, union membership, party membership, voting, trust in public institutions - the figures are going the same way.\"</p> <p>Lack of long runs of data on such habits as entertaining at home make it difficult to track the more informal social connections of Europeans, but intuition suggests they too are going the same way. In some countries an equivalent to the American \"long civic generation\" may be identifiable; in others, like Germany, the opposite might be deemed to be the case.</p> <p>Yet in a much more patchy way, it can be argued, such a generation can be discerned more diverse than its American equivalent because of the different experiences of European states and running on a different time scale, but one that has also been giving way over the years to less engaged successors. This would be the generation whose leaders reinvented much of European politics after the war and who created the European Community. If the kind of analysis which Putnam and other social scientists offer is accepted, the central political problem in both continents is civic rather than constitutional or legal.

In Gaza, in occupied Palestine, four men are machinegunned to death by Israeli troops. \"Fatah will not let this crime pass,\" declare Yasser Arafat's militiamen. In Hadera, in Israel's broken heartlands, a car bomb kills, dismembers, destroys. \"The state of Israel will get even,\" declares its half-dove, half-hawk prime minister, Ehud Barak.</p> <p>Mutilated children; endless funerals; bitter, hardening enmity; blood soaking into the soil that both sides claim as their own: this is is the daily butcher's bill, the price paid for the failure of peace. And just when it seems it cannot get worse, it does. \"Only war, that is all we can do,\" says a shell-shocked Jewish woman in Hadera, quoted by our correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. \"We have the power. We must do it.\" But she is wrong. Israel cannot win this \"war\". It does not face an army. It faces a people. Nor can the Palestinians \"defeat\" their enemy. For both, the choice has long been clear. They either live together - or die together.</p> <p>Another day, another radiating ripple of mindless mayhem, deepening hate, and political impotence. Was the explosion in Riyadh that injured three Britons, after the killing in the Saudi capital of a British man last Friday, the work of Islamic militants enraged (and encouraged) by the Palestine morass? Given the way the wave of anti-Israeli feeling in the Arab world has swelled into a broader, anti-western ire, it seems last month's attacks on a US warship and the British embassy in Yemen certainly were. The FBI appears to think so. Its inquiries point even further afield, to fundamentalist Afghanistan and the terrorist training camps of the Saudi renegade millionaire, Osama bin Laden. In Cairo, the recalled Egyptian ambassador to Israel twiddles his thumbs; another pathway to peace has just closed. In Jordan, a destabilised government puts bilateral relations into deep-freeze. In Jerusalem, they get a call from Washington. A new initiative is under way! But within hours, live fire drowns out the talk of truce.</p> <p>Another day, another geopolitical own goal. Here is the news from Baghdad: Saddam Hussein's triumphant rehabilitation continues apace. While the US counts chad, and Europe plays soldiers with an imaginary army, Iraq reopens its oil pipeline to Syria in further mockery of UN sanctions. Here is the news from Damascus: Bashar Assad, after a brief window of opportunity for the west, has decided to play the hard man, just like his old dad. Who lost Syria? Better ask the guys at the state department (but only when the Palm Beach recount is finished). And what is the Arab League saying? It says, with growing conviction, that the entire Arab and Islamic world is on the brink. . . and the west should remember who controls its oil.</p> <p>With each day that passes, the damage caused by the failure to end Israeli-Palestinian violence and resume peace talks grows and spreads exponentially. If the principal antagonists are incapable of stopping it themselves, and if the US is as devoid of new ideas and new energy as it now appears to be, then radical solutions must be sought. Plans to send in British, French and other \"observers\" to try to calm the two sides, now under discussion at the UN, should be expedited. But that can only be a first step. The big, imaginative leap would be for Britain and the EU, plus Russia, to replace a discredited and distracted US as lead mediator and jumpstart the Oslo process - lest it die the death of a thousand, daily cuts and finally expire amid an explosive, widening conflagration.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the Middle East, another day, another atrocity. With accelerating fury, the cycle of violence spins. In Gaza, in occupied Palestine, four men are machinegunned to death by Israeli troops. \"Fatah will not let this crime pass,\" declare Yasser Arafat's militiamen. In Hadera, in Israel's broken heartlands, a car bomb kills, dismembers, destroys. \"The state of Israel will get even,\" declares its half-dove, half-hawk prime minister, Ehud Barak. Mutilated children; endless funerals; bitter, hardening enmity; blood soaking into the soil that both sides claim as their own: this is is the daily butcher's bill, the price paid for the failure of peace. And just when it seems it cannot get worse, it does. \"Only war, that is all we can do,\" says a shell-shocked Jewish woman in Hadera, quoted by our correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. \"We have the power. We must do it.\" But she is wrong. Israel cannot win this \"war\". It does not face an army. It faces a people. Nor can the Palestinians \"defeat\" their enemy. For both, the choice has long been clear. They either live together - or die together. Another day, another radiating ripple of mindless mayhem, deepening hate, and political impotence. Was the explosion in Riyadh that injured three Britons, after the killing in the Saudi capital of a British man last Friday, the work of Islamic militants enraged (and encouraged) by the Palestine morass? Given the way the wave of anti-Israeli feeling in the Arab world has swelled into a broader, anti-western ire, it seems last month's attacks on a US warship and the British embassy in Yemen certainly were. The FBI appears to think so. Its inquiries point even further afield, to fundamentalist Afghanistan and the terrorist training camps of the Saudi renegade millionaire, Osama bin Laden. In Cairo, the recalled Egyptian ambassador to Israel twiddles his thumbs; another pathway to peace has just closed. In Jordan, a destabilised government puts bilateral relations into deep-freeze. In Jerusalem, they get a call from Washington. A new initiative is under way! But within hours, live fire drowns out the talk of truce. Another day, another geopolitical own goal. Here is the news from Baghdad: Saddam Hussein's triumphant rehabilitation continues apace. While the US counts chad, and Europe plays soldiers with an imaginary army, Iraq reopens its oil pipeline to Syria in further mockery of UN sanctions. Here is the news from Damascus: Bashar Assad, after a brief window of opportunity for the west, has decided to play the hard man, just like his old dad. Who lost Syria? Better ask the guys at the state department (but only when the Palm Beach recount is finished). And what is the Arab League saying? It says, with growing conviction, that the entire Arab and Islamic world is on the brink. . . and the west should remember who controls its oil. With each day that passes, the damage caused by the failure to end Israeli-Palestinian violence and resume peace talks grows and spreads exponentially. If the principal antagonists are incapable of stopping it themselves, and if the US is as devoid of new ideas and new energy as it now appears to be, then radical solutions must be sought. Plans to send in British, French and other \"observers\" to try to calm the two sides, now under discussion at the UN, should be expedited. But that can only be a first step. The big, imaginative leap would be for Britain and the EU, plus Russia, to replace a discredited and distracted US as lead mediator and jumpstart the Oslo process - lest it die the death of a thousand, daily cuts and finally expire amid an explosive, widening conflagration.",

It reflects the prime minister's deeply personal appreciation of his top military adviser at a time when the job - of which Mr Blair has demanded so much - is being embroiled in a degree of political controversy unprecedented in modern times, when the armed forces are increasingly becoming a tool of foreign policy. Sir Charles, not surprisingly, is an enthusiastic supporter of the Blair government's show of confidence in the military, in its role, for example, in Kosovo and Sierra Leone - and now as a potential leading player in the proposed EU rapid reaction force.

He has certainly warned Mr Blair about the danger of committing British troops to more operations and was initially deeply sceptical about the plans for a EU rapid reaction force. He is alleged to have told ministers after the Kosovo war: \"You cannot trust the Europeans. They never turn up.\" His scepticism appears to have been allayed by the pledges of troops from EU countries and the decision by many of them to increase their defence budgets and improve military training. He is also understood to have reservations about US plans for a national missile protective shield - a project which has implications for Britain and the rest of the European allies. He goes out of his way to praise Russia's role in ending the Kosovo war by applying pressure on Slobodan Milosevic and now in Nato-led peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. But Tories and Daily Telegraph letter-writing former service chiefs will continue to ask how this plummy-voiced, Harrow-educated, tennis-playing general, a friend to Prince Charles, can possibly be so close to a Labour prime minister. We will have to wait until February, when Sir Charles retires, to find out what he really thinks.",

Three Britons - two men and a woman - were injured late on Wednesday night when their car exploded in the Suleimaniyeh district. One of the men was said to be in a stable condition in hospital with serious injuries to his right leg. The two other occupants of the car suffered minor injuries. Sources in London said that all three worked for the Saudi al-Salam aircraft company, which is half-owned by the US plane-maker Boeing. Last Friday Christopher Rodway, 40, a British engineer who worked at a military hospital, was killed by an explosion in his car in central Riyadh. His wife was slightly injured. There was widespread suspicion yesterday that both incidents were the work of terrorists, though there has been no official confirmation. The explosions do not fit the usual pattern of attacks by Osama bin Laden, the fugitive Saudi Islamist, and associated groups, according to security experts. A source at the Control Risks consultancy, which advises on business risks, said: \"The bombs were relatively small, capable of seriously injuring only the driver. This suggests that a local, previously unknown group with limited capabilities was responsible. \"The motive appears to be anti-western anger over its support for Israel rather than a specific political agenda.\" American, Canadian and European expatriates in Saudi Arabia were at risk and should check their cars. American forces in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar were put on the highest state of alert after the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen on October 12, with the loss of 17 sailors. Six Kuwaitis are being held in Kuwait after the discovery earlier this month of a suspected plot to attack American and British forces there. The authorities say they buried 133kg of explosives in the desert and planned to use it to bomb a US army camp and western military personnel in their homes and vehicles. Yesterday security experts were discussing why, if the Saudi blasts were caused by terrorists, they were aimed at Britons rather than Americans. One possible explanation is that tightened security around Americans has forced terrorists to look for easier targets and that Britain, a close ally of the US actively engaged in maintaining the no-fly zones over Iraq, is a suitable option. Rodway had a military connection, and the three injured on Wednesday had a US connection through their employment. Between 25,000 and 30,000 Britons work in the kingdom.

      "bodyText": "Under the EU's plan, by 2003 the 15 member states will be able to deploy within 60 days up to 60,000 troops, sustainable for at least a year. Britain has agreed to commit up to 12,500 troops from a pool of about double that amount, as well as 72 combat aircraft and 18 surface ships, including an aircraft carrier. Other European countries who are not members of the EU, including Turkey, have pledged thousands of troops. Yet many questions remain unanswered. \"The question is whether this is a virtual or a real force,\" said Col Terence Taylor, assistant director of International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \"The danger is if politicians start to think and behave as if they have a military capability when they don't.\" Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, spoke this week about dealing with \"Europe's back yard\". However, the EU agreed that its proposed rapid reaction force could engage in operations ranging from humanitarian and rescue missions to peacekeeping and \"tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking\". It even envisages \"helping to resolve a crisis between two warring countries or factions\". In reality, any EU force would be deployed for limited operations or form part of a larger UN or Nato-led force, in Bosnia, for example, or Kosovo. For years the EU will not have the equipment to carry out much more than minor rescue or humani tarian missions. Decisions would be by consensus; no EU state would be forced to participate. EU operations would be agreed only if Nato \"as a whole\" (a euphemism for the US) did not want to get involved. General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff \"I don't see this as a huge new commitment. We're not going to rush off and start warfighting. It will be a force that, to start with, will do simple Petersberg tasks\" - humanitarian and peacekeeping missions agreed at Petersberg, near Bonn, in 1992 Lord Healey, former Labour defence secretary \"The rapid reaction force is quite a good idea as such but I'm not in favour of a European security and defence identity\" Lord Robertson, secretary general of Nato \"Frankly, if it were to undermine or endanger the North Atlantic Alliance, I would have nothing to do with it\" Lt Col Ewen Southby-Tailyour (retired) \"European military unity? Don't bother telling that to the marines\" Colonel Terence Taylor, deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies \"My big worry is that they are fine words on paper. We have to be confident they are real not virtual commitments\" Richard Perle, candidate for US defence secretary in a George W Bush administration \"We were alarmed to see the UK, normally so clear-headed over the din of eurobabble, join the French. What really seems to be at work here is a French-led plan to advance its towering conceit\" Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan's former defence secretary \"It will unquestionably undermine the American commitment to Nato and risk the loss of fragile public support in the United States\" William Cohen, Bill Clinton's defence secretary \"It is right and natural that an increasingly integrated Europe seeks to develop its own security and defence policy with a military capability to back it up\" Bruce Kent, vice president of CND \"EU governments seem to be setting up an independent military force without any awareness of their international obligations to the UN\" Vice admiral Sir Louis Le Bailly (retired) \"I can no longer recommend recruitment if it involves serving in this mercenary force. We are confronted with a breach of faith unequalled since the forces' pay was summarily cut in 1931\" Madeleine Albright, US secretary of state \"A European rapid reaction force is a strongly positive development we wholly support. This EU force will be available to both Nato and the EU, in those cases where the alliance as a whole is not militarily engaged. It offers a valuable complement to the efforts and capabilities of Nato\" Tim Spicer, director of private military company Sandline \"Though there is some merit in Europe standing on its own, the fact is it is going to be very expensive. Money could be better spent improving our national capability\" Justin Forsyth, director of policy, Oxfam \"While Oxfam welcomes the creation of the new European defence force, its success rests on whether Europe has the will to use it outside of its backyard. Sadly this was lacking over the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and it remains to be seen as to whether this will improve\" Neil Durkin, spokesman, Amnesty International \"How is it going to square the fact that the UK is the only country in Europe deploying under-18s into conflict situations?\" Lord Blake, constitutional historian \"My instinct is that I am against it. It will have a weakening effect on Nato, which has been a great bulwark over the past 50 years in preserving peace in Europe\" John Major, former PM \"I have always favoured European co-operation on defence but only and exclusively as the European arm of the Nato alliance. The present proposals are totally different and wholly mistaken. Can the secretary of state not understand that what is proposed has no military logic? It adds not one iota of additional capacity. It offers no secure chain of command and, in my judgment, it will undermine Nato\" Martin Bell MP \"I have seen enough of European disunity on the ground in places like Bosnia and Kosovo to be in favour of greater cooperation. Broadly speaking it is a step in the right direction. We have fought under the UN flag in the past and there will be a continuing power of veto.

Mr Criado-Perez has delivered on all his promises so far, and the City is giving him the benefit of the doubt, but the going may be about to get a great deal tougher. Cross-pond gaze There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from yesterday's Bank of England's report on lending to Britain's most depressed areas - the country needs its own version of America's community reinvestment act. Given that Labour has stolen so many of its policies - elected mayors, drug czars, independent central banks - from the US, it is surprising that it has so far showed little interest in a CRA, which has been hugely successful in forcing banks in the US to stump up for regeneration projects. According to the Bank, budding entrepreneurs in rundown areas can find finance for their new businesses, but only at a price. Interest rates are higher than they are elsewhere in the country because the banks believe there may be a lack of business experience, a lack of collateral and personal equity, remoteness, small and localised markets and high crime rates. But actually the report rather pulls its punches, because what it does not say is that some banks are much more willing to take risks than others. The New Economics Foundation, which has been at the forefront of attempts to find new ways of financing businesses in inner cities, says that NatWest has a much better record than its rivals. Two steps now need to be taken by the government. First, it should not allow banks to hide behind a cloak of anonymity but insist that they reveal in full the extent of their lending - or non-lending - to inner-city London, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow.

Many readers in teaching have been worrying how dear old Chris Woodhead is preparing for his new post as a leader writer, and sad to relate the answer is very slowly indeed. The big shock for Chris so far has been that he is expected to type his own articles. No minion is on hand, as he anticipated, to record his thoughts, so the paper has sent him on a computer course. However, since Chris appears never to have used one before, he has had to start at the beginning with \"this is the 'on' switch\", etc. Worse still, he cannot type at all, even with two fingers. Telegraph executives are looking forward to his first hard-hitting leader, but some are concerned that, at current speed, it will be anywhere between nine months and two years out of date. And all this from a man who poured such scorn on the concept of lifelong learning.</p> <p>\u0095As for the Express, new owner Richard Desmond, the porn magnate who apparently sues anyone who calls him a porn magnate (we shall see, we shall see), took editor Rizla Rosie Boycott and senior staff to a Chinese restaurant on Wednesday night to celebrate his acquisition. When the waiter came over and asked for drinks orders, the first executive in line asked for a pint of lager. The porn magnate, a teetotaller, frowned ostentatiously and asked for a soft drink. From then on, as you've doubtless guessed, every executive asked for a soft drink as well. That's the kind of fearlessness that made the Express what it is today.</p> <p>\u0095There is no word yet on Mr Desmond's views on cannabis, but Rizla notably eschewed rolling a joint over the coffee and fortune cookies. One can understand her playing it safe like this, all the more so since she has been assured by Mr Desmond that her job is absolutely safe. Oh dear. Still, if she can cling on, good luck to her. There's certainly no reason why she might resign on principle, what with founding Spare Rib magazine and working for a porn magnate being such obviously compatible things.</p> <p>\u0095By way of tribute to this litigious porn magnate, meanwhile, next week's Guest Magazine will be his splendid Readers Wives. I was planning to suggest that Andrew Neil should be given Mr Desmond's Asian Babes to edit as consolation for the Barclay Brothers being beaten in the Express bidding, but a so-called rival has cracked that one already in the Mail. So I won't. Nor will I mention John Moorhead's suggestion that, what with him being a top porn magnate, Mr Desmond may be the man to put the beaver back in Beaverbrook.</p> <p>\u0095And so, after that overdose of media shop talk, to the World Health Organisation's suggested panacea for that and everything else, the chicken soup. In step two of my mother's recipe, take your boiling chicken (preferably kosher) and cut it into quarters, clean them well and remove any blood. Now then, pull out all the schmaltz (remove all the fat, and keep for future rendering when making chopped liver). Take a large saucepan, cover the chicken with plenty of water and bring to boil.

      "bodyText": "\u0095While the eyes of the newspaper world are on the sale of the Express (of which much more below), we begin today at the Daily Telegraph. Many readers in teaching have been worrying how dear old Chris Woodhead is preparing for his new post as a leader writer, and sad to relate the answer is very slowly indeed. The big shock for Chris so far has been that he is expected to type his own articles. No minion is on hand, as he anticipated, to record his thoughts, so the paper has sent him on a computer course. However, since Chris appears never to have used one before, he has had to start at the beginning with \"this is the 'on' switch\", etc. Worse still, he cannot type at all, even with two fingers. Telegraph executives are looking forward to his first hard-hitting leader, but some are concerned that, at current speed, it will be anywhere between nine months and two years out of date. And all this from a man who poured such scorn on the concept of lifelong learning. \u0095As for the Express, new owner Richard Desmond, the porn magnate who apparently sues anyone who calls him a porn magnate (we shall see, we shall see), took editor Rizla Rosie Boycott and senior staff to a Chinese restaurant on Wednesday night to celebrate his acquisition. When the waiter came over and asked for drinks orders, the first executive in line asked for a pint of lager. The porn magnate, a teetotaller, frowned ostentatiously and asked for a soft drink. From then on, as you've doubtless guessed, every executive asked for a soft drink as well. That's the kind of fearlessness that made the Express what it is today. \u0095There is no word yet on Mr Desmond's views on cannabis, but Rizla notably eschewed rolling a joint over the coffee and fortune cookies. One can understand her playing it safe like this, all the more so since she has been assured by Mr Desmond that her job is absolutely safe. Oh dear. Still, if she can cling on, good luck to her. There's certainly no reason why she might resign on principle, what with founding Spare Rib magazine and working for a porn magnate being such obviously compatible things. \u0095By way of tribute to this litigious porn magnate, meanwhile, next week's Guest Magazine will be his splendid Readers Wives. I was planning to suggest that Andrew Neil should be given Mr Desmond's Asian Babes to edit as consolation for the Barclay Brothers being beaten in the Express bidding, but a so-called rival has cracked that one already in the Mail. So I won't. Nor will I mention John Moorhead's suggestion that, what with him being a top porn magnate, Mr Desmond may be the man to put the beaver back in Beaverbrook. \u0095And so, after that overdose of media shop talk, to the World Health Organisation's suggested panacea for that and everything else, the chicken soup. In step two of my mother's recipe, take your boiling chicken (preferably kosher) and cut it into quarters, clean them well and remove any blood. Now then, pull out all the schmaltz (remove all the fat, and keep for future rendering when making chopped liver). Take a large saucepan, cover the chicken with plenty of water and bring to boil. Once it is boiling fiercely, turn flame right down and skim at least three times while it simmers. Next step: the giblets. \u0095In Perth, John Thaw- besotted Jayne Griffiths, who has 900 photos of the actor and has never missed a thing he's done, couldn't wait for the final Morse to be screened in western Australia.

Never do they lose their composure, ditch the toothbrush in favour of a pickaxe and seek to hack their fossilised discovery from its grave with a guttural scream of rage. You get the feeling that they would be very good at those jigsaws of plates of baked beans. </p> <p> <strong> Horizon: Extreme Dinosaurs </strong> (BBC2) followed Dr Phil Currie, who hoped to establish that there were really big dinosaurs of all kinds in South America, some of whom hung around together. (All right, it was a bit more complex than that, but that's the gist of it). Currie was a driven man, who could identify any meat-eating dinosaur from a single tooth. His travels and travails, along with those of equally dedicated individuals, saw him jaunt from Patagonia to the badlands of Canada in search of proof of his thesis. </p> <p>And proof he eventually found. After scrutinising and scouring, he discovered a bone bed, which he thought proved that meat-eating dinosaurs lived in packs, a theory previously written off. This, together with the discovery of a ginormous herbivore in Argentina, led Dr Currie to the conclusion that conventional wisdom about dinosaur behaviour - tyrannosaurus rex and long-necked herbivores never met - was wrong. Currie's discovery, the narrator assured us, meant that \"a clash of the titans\", a fight between the biggest animals ever to have lived, could have happened. You hear that, Margaret? Get out the bunting. </p> <p>While Horizon might have been required viewing for those interested in the bare bones of dinosaurs, for me it was a case of \"And your point, caller?\" Yes, it's good that scientists know how much the argentinasaurus weighed. It's important to advance new theories of meat-eating dinosaurs' behaviour. And it's amazing to imagine what a fight between the two would have been like. But really, the faux drama, the bombardment of rhetorical questions and the never-ending close-ups of scary bones was too much. \"Pure science, sheer drama\" is how Horizon is being promoted, but in Extreme Dinosaurs the drama was distinctly lacklustre. In the end, who cares if the two dinosaurs lived together? Who knew they didn't? What Horizon did was advance a theory, dispel it and put forward a new one which basically accorded with what people thought anyway. That's not drama, it's flogging a dead horse. Or a dead argentinasaurus. Then again, maybe I have dinosaur fatigue. </p> <p>Much more dramatic and vital was <strong> Dispatches </strong> (C4). An investigation into NHS waiting lists, How To Jump The Health Queue should be compulsory viewing for anyone who'll ever need health care in the UK. (So that will be everyone, then. Apart from Madonna). Following a variety of cases, from the cosmetic to the serious, the programme was packed with shocking statistics and outrageous case studies. From the evils of answering machines and \"your call has been placed in a queue\" through misplaced notes to the grinding bureaucracy of the NHS, which seems deliberately designed to baffle patients, Dispatches was a triumph in investigative consumer journalism. Looking at a patient with diseased teeth and gums that had required attention for years, another with a degenerative joint disorder which desperately needed treatment, the programme showed the short cuts, the navigation of negotiation and the ways to outwit a service, the prime directive of which - heal the sick - seems to have been forgotten. (If you've been waiting ages for an operation, getting C4 involved would seem the best way to get prompt action). </p> <p>To its credit, Dispatches at no point chastised the quality of care when it was actually provided. Rather, it targeted the bureaucracy which is, at the very least, destroying patients' spirits. Nor did it avoid the notion of morality, and whether jumping the waiting list was wrong. It would be wrong, experts said, if the queueing system were fair. Which it isn't. </p> <p>By no means a clarion call for privatisation, Dispatches was more a solicitation for smarter working and a rallying cry for empowering patients. Sometimes, you shouldn't need the patience of a palaeontologist.</p>",

While Horizon might have been required viewing for those interested in the bare bones of dinosaurs, for me it was a case of \"And your point, caller?\" Yes, it's good that scientists know how much the argentinasaurus weighed. It's important to advance new theories of meat-eating dinosaurs' behaviour. And it's amazing to imagine what a fight between the two would have been like. But really, the faux drama, the bombardment of rhetorical questions and the never-ending close-ups of scary bones was too much. \"Pure science, sheer drama\" is how Horizon is being promoted, but in Extreme Dinosaurs the drama was distinctly lacklustre. In the end, who cares if the two dinosaurs lived together? Who knew they didn't? What Horizon did was advance a theory, dispel it and put forward a new one which basically accorded with what people thought anyway. That's not drama, it's flogging a dead horse. Or a dead argentinasaurus. Then again, maybe I have dinosaur fatigue. Much more dramatic and vital was Dispatches (C4). An investigation into NHS waiting lists, How To Jump The Health Queue should be compulsory viewing for anyone who'll ever need health care in the UK. (So that will be everyone, then. Apart from Madonna). Following a variety of cases, from the cosmetic to the serious, the programme was packed with shocking statistics and outrageous case studies. From the evils of answering machines and \"your call has been placed in a queue\" through misplaced notes to the grinding bureaucracy of the NHS, which seems deliberately designed to baffle patients, Dispatches was a triumph in investigative consumer journalism. Looking at a patient with diseased teeth and gums that had required attention for years, another with a degenerative joint disorder which desperately needed treatment, the programme showed the short cuts, the navigation of negotiation and the ways to outwit a service, the prime directive of which - heal the sick - seems to have been forgotten. (If you've been waiting ages for an operation, getting C4 involved would seem the best way to get prompt action). To its credit, Dispatches at no point chastised the quality of care when it was actually provided. Rather, it targeted the bureaucracy which is, at the very least, destroying patients' spirits. Nor did it avoid the notion of morality, and whether jumping the waiting list was wrong. It would be wrong, experts said, if the queueing system were fair. Which it isn't. By no means a clarion call for privatisation, Dispatches was more a solicitation for smarter working and a rallying cry for empowering patients. Sometimes, you shouldn't need the patience of a palaeontologist.",

      "byline": "Jacques Perett",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Television was, I believe, invented in order to capture one specific moment: David Lee Roth crashing through a giant piece of tissue paper on a massive power-trike; leaping, Evil Knievel-style, over 16 bikini-clad laydeez, lying breast-implant to breast-implant across the exploding stage below. </p> <p>Forget Later with Jools Holland or Westlife on Dale's Lottery Show; the zenith of music TV came in the 80s - Roth's stage arrival, a high watermark for Cock Rock. Never again will a TV audience experience that irresistible combination of power machinery, casual misogyny and baroque guitar solo, swathed in pink smoke on a set that made Robot Wars look like Jackanory. </p> <p>On Saturday, Channel 4 repeat Top Ten: Stadium Rock, a rundown of the most preposterous rock acts of all time. Nostalgia for the Van Halen mid-80s is on a roll. BBC2 plan to follow up their I Love The Seventies series with, yes, I Love Belinda Carlisle, Shoulder Pads and Ecstasy. Enjoyable though these wallows are, the problem with a show like Top Ten is that it's just too fast-moving and entertaining to do real justice to the paint-drying dullness of the era. </p> <p>In 1990, it was still possible to catch stadium dinosaurs playing live on TV in all their pompous, bad-perm glory, without being the butt of a retro-show joke. Mike Mansfield's Cue The Music gave full range to the talents of T'Pau and Chris De Burgh, a crime that wouldn't be allowed in today's competitive schedule. </p> <p>Another drawback with these retro-romps is how skewed the story of the past becomes in the retelling. Will the BBC's I Love The Eighties tell us that Acid House was nowhere near as big as Bananarama or Eddie Shah? I doubt it. In a tightly edited, chuckle-at-the-hairdos show, one gets little idea of just how much the past, even the MTV-paced 80s, dragged: a Wham! video looks like an Eric Rohmer movie by today's morphed, stretched, flamed-up efforts. </p> <p>Ironically, today's music TV, though classier than Van Halen on power-trikes, is far less enjoyable. Just a dull parade of cool bands in low-slung denim shouting \"Whasssup?!\" In part, this can be explained by the homogenisation of taste. Music TV is underpinned by a false notion of consensus - Q-value. This is epitomised by the impromptu jam on Later - Bj\u00f6rk, Texas and The Wu Tang Clan together in smug harmony. </p> <p>It's uncool to admit it, but no one's really interested in the Later jam. The real musical taste of Britain is pretty much stuck in the Van Halen era. Its barometer isn't Badly Drawn Boy on the Mercury Music prize but the cassette carousel at a petrol station: Best Of Saxon; Anita Dobson Sings The Chieftains; Lloyd Cole's remaindered third album. Petrol station cassettes reflect the surreal ecleticism of ordinary people's tastes, rarely - if ever - captured on TV. This is because music TV is really a Helly Hansen-clad conspiracy against middle-aged MOR Britain. </p> <p>The highest aspiration of a challenging music show today is to reflect the listening habits of dot.com man in his Clerken-loft, flipping from Coldplay to Craig David on his mahogany MP3 player. Far less exciting than watching Dave Lee Roth split his trousers. In many ways, today's equivalent of the off-limits Van Halen performance is dance music. Television is keen to digest club music and regurgitate it in a familiar TV magazine form because clubs are still, in theory, the gateway to a huge potential audience. </p> <p>They can't, of course. Because clubbing is, in essence, very similar to 70s prog-rock - the open-ended experience can't be repackaged in a trite televisual way. TV and pop music are increasingly peripheral to the leisure interests of 16-year-olds, who are less likely to want to become DJs than members of a morose prog-band like Godspeed You Black Emperor! playing symphonic rock for 10-hour stretches in their bedrooms. Mainstream clubbing, the sound of stadium trance - still the teenager's weekend of choice - rarely, if ever, gets an accurate airing on TV (save in the apocalyptic Paul Oakenfold theme music to Big Brother - a clever piece of brand association with a huge youth phenomenon). </p> <p>In the year 2000, funny clips of a cod-pieced Dave Lee Roth in dodgy striped legwarmers may appear to have little in common with a major shift in musical taste, but you'd be surprised. Off the back of the re-release of Spinal Tap (newly relevant to a generation schooled on self-indulgent rock clich\u00e9s from the 90s), the writers have produced a spoof of online music service Napster... called Tapster. Increasingly, the teen audience are looking for longplay culture. A laid-back, less naff, less MTV-ish sensibility, delivered, ironically, at super-fast speed on the net. </p> <p>TV has little hope of reflecting this shift with music shows, still hung up on teen formats little different from Ready Steady Go... or late night formats little different from The Old Grey Whistle Test. Strange as it may seem, TV's holy grail - the 16-to-34-year-old audience - is starting to look as ill-served in its tastes as an ageing metaller with a penchant for Van Halen who wants to see the whole gig. Don't worry, soon you can, but it won't be on telly. And it won't be free. </p> <p>\u0095 Top Ten: Stadium Rock, Saturday, 9.05pm, C4. Later with Jools Holland, Saturday, 12.05am, BBC2</p>",

      "bodyText": "Television was, I believe, invented in order to capture one specific moment: David Lee Roth crashing through a giant piece of tissue paper on a massive power-trike; leaping, Evil Knievel-style, over 16 bikini-clad laydeez, lying breast-implant to breast-implant across the exploding stage below. Forget Later with Jools Holland or Westlife on Dale's Lottery Show; the zenith of music TV came in the 80s - Roth's stage arrival, a high watermark for Cock Rock. Never again will a TV audience experience that irresistible combination of power machinery, casual misogyny and baroque guitar solo, swathed in pink smoke on a set that made Robot Wars look like Jackanory. On Saturday, Channel 4 repeat Top Ten: Stadium Rock, a rundown of the most preposterous rock acts of all time. Nostalgia for the Van Halen mid-80s is on a roll. BBC2 plan to follow up their I Love The Seventies series with, yes, I Love Belinda Carlisle, Shoulder Pads and Ecstasy. Enjoyable though these wallows are, the problem with a show like Top Ten is that it's just too fast-moving and entertaining to do real justice to the paint-drying dullness of the era. In 1990, it was still possible to catch stadium dinosaurs playing live on TV in all their pompous, bad-perm glory, without being the butt of a retro-show joke. Mike Mansfield's Cue The Music gave full range to the talents of T'Pau and Chris De Burgh, a crime that wouldn't be allowed in today's competitive schedule. Another drawback with these retro-romps is how skewed the story of the past becomes in the retelling. Will the BBC's I Love The Eighties tell us that Acid House was nowhere near as big as Bananarama or Eddie Shah? I doubt it. In a tightly edited, chuckle-at-the-hairdos show, one gets little idea of just how much the past, even the MTV-paced 80s, dragged: a Wham! video looks like an Eric Rohmer movie by today's morphed, stretched, flamed-up efforts. Ironically, today's music TV, though classier than Van Halen on power-trikes, is far less enjoyable. Just a dull parade of cool bands in low-slung denim shouting \"Whasssup?!\" In part, this can be explained by the homogenisation of taste. Music TV is underpinned by a false notion of consensus - Q-value. This is epitomised by the impromptu jam on Later - Bj\u00f6rk, Texas and The Wu Tang Clan together in smug harmony. It's uncool to admit it, but no one's really interested in the Later jam. The real musical taste of Britain is pretty much stuck in the Van Halen era. Its barometer isn't Badly Drawn Boy on the Mercury Music prize but the cassette carousel at a petrol station: Best Of Saxon; Anita Dobson Sings The Chieftains; Lloyd Cole's remaindered third album. Petrol station cassettes reflect the surreal ecleticism of ordinary people's tastes, rarely - if ever - captured on TV. This is because music TV is really a Helly Hansen-clad conspiracy against middle-aged MOR Britain. The highest aspiration of a challenging music show today is to reflect the listening habits of dot.com man in his Clerken-loft, flipping from Coldplay to Craig David on his mahogany MP3 player. Far less exciting than watching Dave Lee Roth split his trousers. In many ways, today's equivalent of the off-limits Van Halen performance is dance music. Television is keen to digest club music and regurgitate it in a familiar TV magazine form because clubs are still, in theory, the gateway to a huge potential audience. They can't, of course. Because clubbing is, in essence, very similar to 70s prog-rock - the open-ended experience can't be repackaged in a trite televisual way. TV and pop music are increasingly peripheral to the leisure interests of 16-year-olds, who are less likely to want to become DJs than members of a morose prog-band like Godspeed You Black Emperor! playing symphonic rock for 10-hour stretches in their bedrooms. Mainstream clubbing, the sound of stadium trance - still the teenager's weekend of choice - rarely, if ever, gets an accurate airing on TV (save in the apocalyptic Paul Oakenfold theme music to Big Brother - a clever piece of brand association with a huge youth phenomenon). In the year 2000, funny clips of a cod-pieced Dave Lee Roth in dodgy striped legwarmers may appear to have little in common with a major shift in musical taste, but you'd be surprised. Off the back of the re-release of Spinal Tap (newly relevant to a generation schooled on self-indulgent rock clich\u00e9s from the 90s), the writers have produced a spoof of online music service Napster... called Tapster. Increasingly, the teen audience are looking for longplay culture. A laid-back, less naff, less MTV-ish sensibility, delivered, ironically, at super-fast speed on the net. TV has little hope of reflecting this shift with music shows, still hung up on teen formats little different from Ready Steady Go... or late night formats little different from The Old Grey Whistle Test. Strange as it may seem, TV's holy grail - the 16-to-34-year-old audience - is starting to look as ill-served in its tastes as an ageing metaller with a penchant for Van Halen who wants to see the whole gig. Don't worry, soon you can, but it won't be on telly. And it won't be free. \u0095 Top Ten: Stadium Rock, Saturday, 9.05pm, C4. Later with Jools Holland, Saturday, 12.05am, BBC2",

In the longer term, it says funds should encourage sustainable land use, such as the production of sandalwood, nuts or wild flowers and the farming of kangaroos and ostriches, which have a lower impact on the environment than cattle. But the states and the federal government clash over who should fund such \"compensation\". Constitutionally, land management is a state issue, but its consequences - damaging biodiversity, causing salinity and greenhouse gases - are federal. The ACF wants tough new laws brought in. \"Clearing has never stopped anywhere in the world without sternly enforced regulations,\" says the Mr Sherwin. Despite opposition, Queensland introduced legislation to control land clearing. But the state's Labor government refused to ratify the new law for nine months. The attempt to force funding from the rightwing federal government triggered \"panic clearing\", as farmers raced to rip up trees before the curbs became law. The new law, preventing the clearing of endangered ecosystems on freehold land, could protect 3.5% of Queensland's vegetation, says the ACF. Inez Rosser is pessimistic about her rainforest. But Ms Wearing hopes for a revolution in land management. \"We're using resources unsustainably and not earning enough from them to pay for the cost of the degradation we are causing,\" she says. \"But I do believe it is being increasingly recognised. One has to be optimistic. The alternative is too awful to imagine.\" www.acfonline.org.au/ index.htm Australian Conservation Foundation www.qccqld.org.au Queensland Conservation Council",

      "bodyText": "Britain's rail passengers may have been put at increased risk by the safety measures which were introduced to protect them in the aftermath of the Hatfield crash, it emerged today. Fears that the widespread speed restrictions and timetable changes on the rail network increased the risk of drivers inadvertently going through red lights were set out in a confidential Railtrack document, the Financial Times reported. Railtrack has already applied to lift 50 of the speed restrictions on the network in response to concerns that the severe disruption of routines could lead to drivers making dangerous mistakes, the paper claimed. Drivers are thought to be abiding by a list of special directions on speed changes which runs to 16 pages and has prompted concerns that it could lead to confusion and error. Signals passed at red (Spads) are 10 times more likely to lead to a fatal accident than trains encountering broken rails, the problem which the speed restrictions were designed to avoid. The health and safety executive is understood to be waiting for a new internal risk assessment to be carried out by Railtrack before the application for speed restrictions to be lifted is considered. The network operator was also believed to have expressed concern about the danger of overcrowding on platforms and trains due to restricted services, the FT said. The strategic rail authority chairman, Sir Alastair Morton, has expressed similar fears about the dangers of the new safety measures to government ministers, according to a report in the Economist. Mr Morton was advised by SRA safety experts that not only were travellers abandoning the rails for the roads, where they were statistically more likely to be killed in accidents, but dis ruption to train drivers' routines was making them more likely to make mistakes, the weekly said. A spokeswoman for the authority said last night: \"The strategic rail authority, the government and the rail industry are doing everything they can to make sure that safety is paramount on the network.\" She added she was unaware of Sir Alastair making any such comments, and dismissed the report as \"idle speculation\". But the Economist quoted safety experts as estimating that the growth in road traffic resulting from frustrated passengers giving up on the trains was likely to cause five extra deaths and 75 serious injuries. Meanwhile, as passengers continued to desert the rail network in record numbers, rail companies began to fearfully count the cost - already believed to have reached \u00a3200m. Some companies were be lieved to have already approached John Prescott to ask for help amid fears that the shortfall could force them out of business completely. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions denied reports that the deputy prime minister was preparing to rescue the worst-hit companies with taxpayers' money. It also emerged that trains on a branch line in West Yorkshire ground to a halt when passengers left a commuter service after a series of delays, saying it was quicker to walk home along the track. But the mutinous commuters on the Northern Spirit 17.04 service from Leeds to Skipton caused further delays to other services. The train stopped outside Keighley station on Wednesday night after other services broke down up the line. When the driver announced that due to signal failure the train would return to Leeds, 20 miles back, the passengers left the train and set out on foot.",

      "body": "<p>During the long presidential campaign, Al Gore's energetic and innovative media team fired off around a dozen emails a day to journalists covering the election.</p> <p>They rubbished speeches made by his Republican rival George W Bush, they quoted every statement Mr Gore made. They provided figures that proved the emptiness of Mr Bush's claims and touted Gore's record on everything from the environment to prescription fees.</p> <p>Now the guns are silent. And while the main reason is obviously that the campaign is over, there is a feeling that Gore's backers are gradually losing the stomach for the fight.</p> <p>Maureen Dowd, who with Gail Collins has been providing some of the wittiest commentaries in the New York Times on the Florida events, summed up Mr Gore's problem in a column this week: \"Al Gore wants the presidency more than the Democrats do. And the Republicans want the presidency more than W does.</p> <p>\"Mr Gore is more rabid than his campaign team and party. Mr Bush's campaign team and party are more rabid than him. Each side will do what it takes. But the Bushes prefer to let the help get their hands dirty.\"</p> <p>The \"help\" that is working for Mr Gore has faced an uphill task since the moment he made his phone call to Mr Bush to withdraw his concession of defeat on election night two and a half weeks ago. For every twist and turn that has gone Mr Gore's way, there seem to be two that have been to the Bush camp's advantage.</p> <p>The Democrats are worried that the continuing fight shows Mr Gore as a bad loser. They know they could be punished in the Congressional elections in two years time if Mr Gore wins the vote but loses the argument. They know, too, that if Mr Bush wins, the Democrats chances of taking seats in those elections will be substantially increased as an electorate seeks to right the imbalance. They fear the worst possible scenario: that Mr Gore loses both the presidency and the argument.</p> <p>The people who bankrolled Mr Gore's campaign are still writing cheques to fund the costly business of hiring the country's most expensive lawyers to mount the legal challenges in Florida. But there is a sense that the time is coming when they will wonder if the money is being poured down a Palm Beach drain.</p> <p>When the Florida supreme court ruled that recounts taking place would stand, Mr Gore decided to let it be known that he was quietly planning his own administration. \"I believe it's now appropriate for both of us to focus on the transition,\" he said on Tuesday night.</p> <p>But since then, potential victory seems to be slipping away, and with it the support. While Mr Gore's most loyal aides say they still find it hard to believe that a convicted drunk driver who seems more at home playing with his dog Spot than tackling international issues could possibly become president, there is a weariness about the whole process and a feeling that this weekend the long battle may be over.</p> <p>Rightwing commentators have joined the process of moulding public opinion against Mr Gore. \"We know the whole thing has been rigged and we've known from the get-go,\" said rightwing talk show host Rush Limbaugh in his widely syndicated show this week. While the claim may be a piece of dishonest partisan propagandising, it is one that is being taken up across the country.</p> <p>The Democrats who are taking the temperature in the states may still be publicly backing Mr Gore's challenges but they will be noting shifts in public sentiment against their man. The financial markets have been giving their own verdicts on Mr Gore's chances. When it emerged that he would not get the Miami-Dade recounts, shares in tobacco, pharmaceuticals and Microsoft - industries or organisations that all believe they would benefit from a Bush victory - suddenly rose.</p> <p>Many Democrats feel Mr Gore misplayed the challenge made by Green party candidate Ralph Nader and there are still recriminations under way over his role. This week, Mr Nader came up with his own solution. He told the Denver Post that the best way to decide the election would be to spin a coin. \"There is really no other way to end this,\" he said. \"At this point, no one will ever know who really won Florida.\"</p> <p>Mr Nader's suggestion is that the coin-toss be televised live and the commercial air time used to finance the next presidential campaigns so that parties did not need other contributions.</p> <p>Mr Gore might well settle for such a solution right now. But over the next few days he will have to decide whether he wants to risk the political equivalent of a Mafia garroting or bow out with dignity and live to fight another day.</p> <p><b>Key document</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/guardian/pdf/1122floridaruling.pdf\">Download the Florida supreme court ruling (pdf file)</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,400160,00.html\">Timeline - when will America decide?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,401153,00.html\">22 November: The chad debate - are dimples Gore's best hope?</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1119vulliamy.rm\">Ed Vulliamy on Palm Beach (3mins 45)</a></p> <p><b>Local media</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tdo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tallahassee Democrat</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/\" target=\"_new\">Palm Beach Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/\">Sun Sentinel</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/sct.html\" target=\"_new\">Florida supreme court</a><br><a href=\"http://www.presidentelect.org/results.html\" target=\"_new\">The latest state of the count</a><br><a href=\"http://www.policy.com/news/dbrief/dbriefarc770.asp\" target=\"_new\">Arguments for and against reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.truthinmedia.org/Columns/Electoral-College.html\" target=\"_new\">Origins of the Electoral College</a><br><a href=\"http://www.kscourts.org/lawwise/marwise.htm\" target=\"_new\">How the system works</a><br><a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~lorrie/pubs/diss/footnode.html#377\" target=\"_NEW\">A learned definition of chad</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~lorrie/pubs/diss/node5.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Academic analysis of US voting systems</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\" target=\"_NEW\">US Federal Election Commission (FEC) </a><br><a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pages/punchrd.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">FEC explanation of the punchcard ballot</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "During the long presidential campaign, Al Gore's energetic and innovative media team fired off around a dozen emails a day to journalists covering the election. They rubbished speeches made by his Republican rival George W Bush, they quoted every statement Mr Gore made. They provided figures that proved the emptiness of Mr Bush's claims and touted Gore's record on everything from the environment to prescription fees. Now the guns are silent. And while the main reason is obviously that the campaign is over, there is a feeling that Gore's backers are gradually losing the stomach for the fight. Maureen Dowd, who with Gail Collins has been providing some of the wittiest commentaries in the New York Times on the Florida events, summed up Mr Gore's problem in a column this week: \"Al Gore wants the presidency more than the Democrats do. And the Republicans want the presidency more than W does. \"Mr Gore is more rabid than his campaign team and party. Mr Bush's campaign team and party are more rabid than him. Each side will do what it takes. But the Bushes prefer to let the help get their hands dirty.\" The \"help\" that is working for Mr Gore has faced an uphill task since the moment he made his phone call to Mr Bush to withdraw his concession of defeat on election night two and a half weeks ago. For every twist and turn that has gone Mr Gore's way, there seem to be two that have been to the Bush camp's advantage. The Democrats are worried that the continuing fight shows Mr Gore as a bad loser. They know they could be punished in the Congressional elections in two years time if Mr Gore wins the vote but loses the argument. They know, too, that if Mr Bush wins, the Democrats chances of taking seats in those elections will be substantially increased as an electorate seeks to right the imbalance. They fear the worst possible scenario: that Mr Gore loses both the presidency and the argument. The people who bankrolled Mr Gore's campaign are still writing cheques to fund the costly business of hiring the country's most expensive lawyers to mount the legal challenges in Florida. But there is a sense that the time is coming when they will wonder if the money is being poured down a Palm Beach drain. When the Florida supreme court ruled that recounts taking place would stand, Mr Gore decided to let it be known that he was quietly planning his own administration. \"I believe it's now appropriate for both of us to focus on the transition,\" he said on Tuesday night. But since then, potential victory seems to be slipping away, and with it the support. While Mr Gore's most loyal aides say they still find it hard to believe that a convicted drunk driver who seems more at home playing with his dog Spot than tackling international issues could possibly become president, there is a weariness about the whole process and a feeling that this weekend the long battle may be over. Rightwing commentators have joined the process of moulding public opinion against Mr Gore. \"We know the whole thing has been rigged and we've known from the get-go,\" said rightwing talk show host Rush Limbaugh in his widely syndicated show this week. While the claim may be a piece of dishonest partisan propagandising, it is one that is being taken up across the country. The Democrats who are taking the temperature in the states may still be publicly backing Mr Gore's challenges but they will be noting shifts in public sentiment against their man. The financial markets have been giving their own verdicts on Mr Gore's chances. When it emerged that he would not get the Miami-Dade recounts, shares in tobacco, pharmaceuticals and Microsoft - industries or organisations that all believe they would benefit from a Bush victory - suddenly rose. Many Democrats feel Mr Gore misplayed the challenge made by Green party candidate Ralph Nader and there are still recriminations under way over his role. This week, Mr Nader came up with his own solution. He told the Denver Post that the best way to decide the election would be to spin a coin. \"There is really no other way to end this,\" he said. \"At this point, no one will ever know who really won Florida.\" Mr Nader's suggestion is that the coin-toss be televised live and the commercial air time used to finance the next presidential campaigns so that parties did not need other contributions. Mr Gore might well settle for such a solution right now. But over the next few days he will have to decide whether he wants to risk the political equivalent of a Mafia garroting or bow out with dignity and live to fight another day.

It stressed that the recall, which applies to both still and sparkling water, was merely a precaution.</p> <p>But the firm first experienced the problem earlier this month and a batch had to be recalled from retailers. The company did not inform the public because it knew none of the bottles had been sold.</p> <p>When the problem recurred early this week it retested samples from previous batches and discovered low levels of bacteria in some, prompting the suspension of production and yesterday's recall.</p> <p>The company, based near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, produces 200,000 bottles a week. It believes the problem may have been caused by flooding which contaminated its bore hole.</p> <p>\"We test water every day and first picked it up on November 9, following the pretty torrential rain we had,\" said managing director David Kearns.</p> <p>\"We stopped production and recalled that batch. We checked all products with that batch code had been returned and they were. We then started getting further readings from current production on Tuesday this week. So we tested different bottles from the batches going back to October 1. Some revealed a very low level of bacteria and we decided to withdraw all of the production.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The food standards agency themselves say the levels are so low, and are not spread evenly, that you could find a reading in one bottle from a batch but not at all in the next six. It's so low that it's actually quite random whether you will find it.</p> <p>\"We had no reason to have any problems at all with the product. Our prognosis suggested it was tied to the flooding and we had covered it. Hindsight is wonderful.\"</p> <p>It seems rising groundwater may have allowed the bore hole at Toms Hill in Aldbury to become contaminated by the faeces, which have not been identified as animal or human. The hole goes 100 metres through the chalk of the Chiltern Hills.</p> <p>Mr Kearns said that tests were showing negative results again, but the firm would not resume production until it was sure the problem had been solved.</p> <p>\"Sales are the last thing I'm concerned about,\" he said. \"From a commercial point of view I would like [resumption of production] to be sooner rather than later, but obviously safety is the primary concern. I think this demonstrates that we did checks and the product is well monitored and safe.\"</p> <p>The FSA is advising people not to consume the water though \"the most likely ill effect, should one occur, from consuming the product would be a stomach upset\".</p>",

The Chiltern Hills Mineral Water Company recalled all Chiltern Hills natural mineral water and Ashridge natural spring water and urged consumers to return unused bottles after discovering bacteria during regular tests. It stressed that the recall, which applies to both still and sparkling water, was merely a precaution. But the firm first experienced the problem earlier this month and a batch had to be recalled from retailers. The company did not inform the public because it knew none of the bottles had been sold. When the problem recurred early this week it retested samples from previous batches and discovered low levels of bacteria in some, prompting the suspension of production and yesterday's recall. The company, based near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, produces 200,000 bottles a week. It believes the problem may have been caused by flooding which contaminated its bore hole. \"We test water every day and first picked it up on November 9, following the pretty torrential rain we had,\" said managing director David Kearns. \"We stopped production and recalled that batch. We checked all products with that batch code had been returned and they were. We then started getting further readings from current production on Tuesday this week. So we tested different bottles from the batches going back to October 1. Some revealed a very low level of bacteria and we decided to withdraw all of the production.\" He added: \"The food standards agency themselves say the levels are so low, and are not spread evenly, that you could find a reading in one bottle from a batch but not at all in the next six. It's so low that it's actually quite random whether you will find it. \"We had no reason to have any problems at all with the product. Our prognosis suggested it was tied to the flooding and we had covered it. Hindsight is wonderful.\" It seems rising groundwater may have allowed the bore hole at Toms Hill in Aldbury to become contaminated by the faeces, which have not been identified as animal or human. The hole goes 100 metres through the chalk of the Chiltern Hills. Mr Kearns said that tests were showing negative results again, but the firm would not resume production until it was sure the problem had been solved. \"Sales are the last thing I'm concerned about,\" he said. \"From a commercial point of view I would like [resumption of production] to be sooner rather than later, but obviously safety is the primary concern. I think this demonstrates that we did checks and the product is well monitored and safe.\" The FSA is advising people not to consume the water though \"the most likely ill effect, should one occur, from consuming the product would be a stomach upset\".",

      "bodyText": "Drug misuse among school children is on the increase, with the number admitting using drugs up from 10% to 11%, according to a government survey published yesterday. Nearly two thirds of 15-year-olds said they had been offered drugs in the past year. The findings, which run counter to recent claims that progress is being made in the fight against drugs, showed that more than one in 10 children aged 11-15 used drugs over the past 12 months, and suggested that government efforts to stem the flow of drugs is failing. At the same time, the number of regular cigarette smokers was found to be on a relatively sharp decline, especially among boys, a trend that started in the mid-1980s. Most school drug users said they had been using cannabis. Surprisingly, the greatest use had been among children in relatively affluent neighbourhoods. Users tended to be children with low expectations of good exam results and generally low esteem. The survey also found that children were eight times more likely to take drugs if their brothers or sisters did so. \"The general picture is a fairly consistent one of small increases amongst both boys and girls, particularly amongst those aged 14 and 15,\" said the authors. The survey, which was conducted among more than 9,000 secondary school children aged 11-15 in some 340 schools in England, is the largest of its kind and is seen as more revealing than simple crime figures showing the number of children cautioned for possessing or selling cannabis. The government's anti-drugs co-ordinator, Keith Hellawell, yesterday chose to ignore the increase, instead praising the common sense of the majority of teenagers who had not taken drugs. The survey showed that boys were more likely to take drugs than girls, by 13% to 12%. But there was a growing likelihood of drug taking as children grew older. As many as 30% of 15-year-olds had taken drugs in the previous year, but only 1% of 11-year-olds. Asian British youngsters were proportionately more unlikely to take drugs, with only 7% admitting having taken drugs in the previous year, against 12% of pupils described as white. A sense of failure at school seemed to be likely to lead children to drugs, with 30% of those that said they were not doing well at school taking drugs. Drug misuse was heavily associated with other forms of anti-social behaviour, with drug users four times more likely to steal, and truants and those excluded from school five times more likely to take drugs. Three-quarters of drug users said they had not told their parents. Yet even among those who did tell their parents, only half thought their parents disapproved. Brothers or sisters or close friends taking drugs was a key determinant. Ministers can take some solace from the finding that there is no sign that drug education programmes in schools actually increase the likelihood of children taking drugs. However, other messages from the government do not seem to be getting through. Most pupils said they enjoyed the experience, 70% saying they had felt \"high, fantastic, happy or giggly\". One child in every 100 had tried drugs before their 11th birthday. By the age of 16, 39% of children have tried drugs, according to the survey - which also predicted that that figure would rise; 55% have smoked cigarettes; and 73% have had an alcoholic drink. Mr Hellawell said: \"Children nowadays have to be told of the full dangers of drugs and have the details spelled out so that they clearly understand the dangers. They are young adults; advising 'just say no', which has never been our policy, does not recognise the need for the kind of structured anti-drugs education programmes the government has in place.\" He said 93% of secondary and 75% of primary schools now had a drugs education policy - up from 86% of secondary and 61% of primary schools in 1997.",

The problems occurred between June 1997 and December 1998 but there is no evidence that anyone has lost out. In July last year Lloyds TSB withdrew from the global custody business. In a statement it said it \"regrets\" the errors which resulted in charges being brought against it. \"The problems were first identified by our own internal monitoring and were immediately notified to Imro. We accept Imro's findings and are very sorry that these errors occurred.

      "bodyText": "The prisons minister, Paul Boateng, yesterday stepped in to head off the risk of chaos throughout the country's prisons by promising talks as the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union threatened a strike if civilian workers were disciplined for refusing to wear name badges. Around 600 electricians, plumbers, fitters and heating engineers have been told by the prison service that they must wear the name tags to ensure prisoners are treated with \"dignity and respect\", but the civilian workers fear that they and their families could become targets for intimidation or blackmail if they are made to identify themselves. Many have defied the instructions and the AEEU, warned yesterday that it would call a ballot for industrial action if any worker were punished. On a visit to Woodhill maximum security jail near Milton Keynes yesterday, Mr Boateng promised discussions with the union to try to resolve the dispute, promising there was \"nothing fixed in concrete\" and insisting that his chief concern was the safety and security of all staff. \"We are looking at this issue very carefully and we will take all the steps necessary in order to give non-uniform staff the sense that they are valued members of the team,\" he said. Mr Boateng's conciliatory remarks were welcomed by Paul Reuter, the AEEU national officer representing the prison workers, who said he looked forward to talks \"so long as they are based on the principle that if prison officers don't have to wear name badges, then nor should our members have to do so.\" The row surfaced in July after Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, ordered that all non-uniformed staff wear name tags in order to emphasise his commitment to \"deal openly and professionally with prisoners\" - and allow them to identify staff if they are mistreated or attacked by them. The AEEU accepts the need to identify staff but wants civilian prison workers to wear numbers - as prison officers do - rather than their names. \"Our members work alongside prisoners every day, carry out searches, lead prisoners out on working parties and can report them for punishment,\" an AEEU spokesman said yesterday. \"They see the name badges as a real potential threat to themselves and their families. Feelings are running very high.\" A prison service spokesman said the unions had been consulted about the badges policy before it was introduced and there was no intention of compromising the personal security of staff. But \"staff in uniformed grades have duties in relation to the supervision and control of prisoners which place them at greater risk than their non-uniformed colleagues\".

But the loss of parity with Germany on the council would, in French eyes, destroy part of the post-war settlement that gave rise to the EU in the first place. The issue was one of the most senstitive at the recent Franco-German summit. So on this subject the French and the British can ally to block Germany. Presi dent Chirac - in domestic political trouble - will be urgently seeking British help. Even within the small states there are disagreements - the Dutch would like more votes than the Belgians. Even this gives Britain room to look for allies. British officials regard the best chance of compromise a deal giving Germany 33 votes, France, Italy and the UK 30, and Spain 27. Britain would achieve its big political objective of aquiring a blocking minority on the council, on an issue discussed under majority voting so long as it has the support of two other big states. But this proposal still might violate President Chirac's sensibilities, creating deadlock. The Finns, on behalf of the smaller nations, are reluctant to accept such dominance by the large countries. The big countries are offering, in return for greater power on the council, that all member states would only have one commissioner each. At present the big countries have two commissioners. Rights It is also now clear that the charter of fundamental rights will, as Britain wishes, end up as solely a political declaration and not be incorporated into the treaty. In this fast-moving swirl of alliances, the French draft will be discussed on Saturday by chief negotiators, including Britain's Sir Stephen Wall. The whole treaty will then be looked at again by foreign ministers on December 3, just four days before the summit itself.",

The operation was conducted in a hotel bedroom in Paris seven weeks before his death on November 30 1900, from acute meningitis. His condition had nothing to do with syphilis, as Wilde biographers Arthur Ransome and Richard Ellman have suggested, but stemmed from a cholosteotoma, a growth in the ear which corrodes the mastoid bone and leaves festering debris in the middle ear. Ashley Robins and Sean Sellars, of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, hypothesise in the Lancet medical journal that doctors, far from trying to remove pus from the eardrum as accounts suggest, were attempting a new procedure, which had only recently been done in France and Germany. The surgery involved the removal of part of the mastoid bone around the ear and the little bones in the middle ear that help transmit sound to the brain. They say the condition had plagued Wilde some time before he was imprisoned, despite assertions that it resulted from a fall in Reading prison, where he had been imprisoned for indecency in 1895.

      "bodyText": "Ownership of a key painting in 20th century art history will be thrashed out in the high court next week, where a Bermudan collector will seek a declaration that he is the true owner of the Jackson Pollock bought in a London gallery over 30 years ago, not the elderly American who claims it is a wedding present stolen over half a century ago. Untitled (Composition with Pouring I), made in 1943, is a tiny piece compared with the barn-door sized canvasses for which Pollock is most famous. However it is of immense importance to historians as the artist's first purely abstract work using paint poured and dripped on to canvas, a technique much mocked and parodied, and hugely influential. Robin David Judah, who lives in Bermuda, is going to court in London to prove he has legal title to the picture, in the wake of an American supreme court case when Mercedes Matter forced the New York Museum of Modern Art to identify him as the anonymous loaner of the picture to a Jackson Pollock retrospective. The painting was also in an exhibition at Tate Britain last year, and had previously been on loan to various American museums. Mrs Matter, who is 87, was a friend of the artist, and claims the painting is the canvas he gave her as a wedding present in 1943. It was stolen from her New York apartment three years later, and she had not seen it since. Yesterday her London lawyer, Helen Bowkley, said she could make no comment on the dispute, as it was sub judice. Mr Judah's lawyer, Michael Tulloch, said: \"We regard this as a private matter which can most appropriately be resolved through the courts, rather than by litigation through allegation and counter-allegation in the media.\" Many recent disputed ownership cases have been triggered by art resurfacing in a high profile exhibition, something which is making both public and private owners nervous about loaning. In the last five years rival claims to ownership of a Monet, and a Van Gogh, have emerged after they were seen in American exhibitions. This year ownership of a massive 19th century German triptych, which was included in the Royal Academy's 1900 exhibition, was formally transferred in a ceremony in the London gallery from the Austrian state collection to an elderly London brother and sister who were able to show that, before the Nazi years, it had hung in their family dining room. Although there is no ques tion of the Jackson Pollock being in any way implicated in the Nazi art controversy, the traditional secrecy over provenance of dealers, galleries and museums is gradually being prised open by the international controversy over the stolen Jewish art. Under English law a buyer may have legal title to a work of art even if it was originally stolen - something which has been bitterly criticised not just by campaigners on Jewish owned art, but also by those trying to block the huge international trade in stolen antiquities. Since 1980 it has been necessary to establish that the purchase was \"in good faith\", but in the 1960s, when the Jackson Pollock was sold both by Sothebys, and by the Marlborough Gallery in London, simple proof of purchase was enough to establish title. \"Paintings are resurfacing all the time,\" said Sarah Jackson, of the Art Loss Register, which is pursuing many lost and stolen works of art. \"The question of Nazi looted art has really sharpened people's minds, and if it has put into their consciousness that provenance is just as important as the traditional concentration on authenticity and condition, that can only be a good thing.\"",

Imagine our surprise when a form arrived from the council asking for information to assess our liability for council tax for the caravan. An interesting point is that we are required to state whether we own the caravan, lease it or rent it. We do none of these things - it was provided by our insurers. I expect that we should really be considered as squatters, who tend not to pay council tax. Of course, we could be evicted by the owners of the land on which we are squatting. Oh... that's us.

      "bodyText": "While Andrew Anderson (Letters, November 23) may disagree, when Michael White and Ian Traynor write \"No 10 distinguishes...\" (Angry Blair lambasts anti-EU nonsense, November 22) they are not telling us how to think, they are reporting the opinion of Alastair Campbell and the prime minister. While saying that, I am glad that the Guardian has moments of subjective or personal reporting on issues of contention. Particularly with regard to Europe, the Guardian's journalists should be praised for taking a line that stands in sharp contrast to the kneejerk rants of its peers. Just because Alastair Campbell says it, doesn't make it a lie. Anyway, I think we can trust Guardian readers to make their own minds up. Tom Freke London tom.freke@intinsider.com \u0095Why do we pay so much attention to Baroness Thatcher's xenophobic comments about Europe (Thatcher's EU attack marks end of affair, November 23)? If any other public figure were to make similar utterances, they'd be pilloried or simply ignored. Not very long ago, in a speech, the baroness told us that God had separated Britain from mainland Europe \"for a reason\". Isn't she aware of the land bridge that used to exist, until rising sea levels drowned it? Isn't she aware of our pan-European lineage: part Roman, part Dane, part Norman French, but mostly Saxon German? Has she forgotten that our royal family is of German descent? Most importantly, does she have any appreciation of the causes of the rise of German fascism? She talks about the \"continent of Europe\" as though it was a foreign realm, nothing to do with these islands. If the British Isles are not part of the continent of Europe, where precisely are they situated? Does she believe that these islands are a floating colony, drifting in the general direction of North America? Geoffrey D Palmer York gdp@lineone.net \u0095Where was I the day Thatcher resigned (Where were you on the day she quit?, November 22)? In heaven. Dr Martin Cloonan Musselburgh, East Lothia M.Cloonan@educ.gla.ac.uk \u0095Much as I love the odd walk down memory lane, I can't help but feel that, when the current government is considering privatising the tube and air traffic control, our fond look at the fall of Thatcherism might be a tad premature.

      "body": "<p>Caroline Benn, who has died aged 74, achieved the extraordinary feat of securing an independent academic status for her work in education while winning widespread political admiration for the way in which she managed the very difficult business of being married to one of the most prominent postwar socialists in Britain, Tony Benn. And she did this while remaining a determinedly private person. </p> <p>She was famous in education circles for her heroic commitment to the principles of comprehensive education. She was equally popular on the political left, among the many distinguished friends she and her husband made together, and in his constituencies, because she was personable, funny and unstinting in her support of the Labour party cause. Yet she managed to balance her public and personal life, raise four children and keep herself out of the public spotlight. It was difficult, but she did it. </p> <p>She won considerable praise for doing so from a variety of sources. Dora Gaitskell, wife of the Labour leader of the late 1950s and early 1960s, once commended her to Tony Benn - and, according to his diaries, \"touched my heart\" - for having brought up her children without any fuss. In 1957, a group of Labour party friends, including Richard Crossman, told Tony that they had voted Caroline \"the best wife for a leader of the Labour party\". Susan Crosland wrote in her memoir of her late husband, the sometime Labour minister and author of The Future Of Socialism, Anthony Crosland, of the \"wisecrack candour\" that was part of Caroline Benn's attraction. </p> <p>But, perhaps because of the intense public scrutiny to which her husband was constantly subjected, Caroline Benn went to great lengths never to reveal herself unwittingly in public. She did not give interviews, and there is scarcely a meaningful reference to her in the newspaper cuttings libraries that she and her husband learned so much to detest. </p> <p>Yet even while she was performing this modern miracle role - juggling all the balls of wife, mother, political partner, academic and author, and keeping out of the newspapers - her husband was, in fact, revealing the reality. The published diaries that Tony Benn so assiduously kept across his long political career tell it all. Theirs was one of the great love matches, and it is all there in his records. Caroline is on every other page; advising him on political issues, expressing her opinion, accompanying him everywhere - abroad, to parties, and round the corner to friends. </p> <p>Here we are in September 1959: \"Caroline's advice was, as always, the most sensible: 'The most important thing is that you should be seen to be an easy man to work with.'\" Then, in March 1960, with Labour's national executive committee (NEC) discussing rewriting clause 4: \"Caroline said: 'Keep your mouth shut today.'\" Again, in October 1960, when Benn himself resigned from the NEC, he noted: \"Caroline was as sweet as can be, but she thought I shouldn't have done it.\" </p> <p>She was very influential in his political career, and is personally credited with having suggested the title of the Labour manifesto for the 1964 general election; she proposed The New Britain, and it eventually became Let's Go With Labour For The New Britain. </p> <p>In one volume of Tony Benn's diaries, there are no fewer than 166 page references to his wife, and neither the frequency nor the warmth about \"my Caroline\" diminish with the passage of the years: \"Caroline was wonderful\"; \"Caroline, who is much braver than I am\"; \"She is a marvellous woman and I am quite exceptionally fortunate in being married to her\"; \"That is Caroline all over - tremendously modest and yet determined\"; and, on August 2 1973: \"25 years ago today, I met Caroline.\" </p> <p>They met over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 and, nine days later, Tony Benn proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford city council and installed it in the garden of their house in Holland Park; in June 1999, on their golden wedding anniversary, she put on the red striped dress she had worn that night. They planned, some years ago, to be buried together in the garden of their house in Essex, with the bench to mark the grave. </p> <p>Caroline Middleton DeCamp came from Cincinnati, Ohio, a member of a family descended from three French Huguenot brothers who fled to America in the 17th century. Her father, and both her grandfathers, were lawyers, and her maternal great-grandfather was a United States solicitor-general. She graduated from Vassar College in 1945, and got a second degree at the University of Cincinnati in 1948, the year she came to England. After her marriage, she got a master's degree at University College, London, in 1951. </p> <p>In 1964, Tony and Caroline Benn decided to move their children from Westminster preparatory school to Holland Park comprehensive school, one of the first in the country. From then on, Caroline, who was to become the chair of governors at Holland Park for 13 years (and, at 35 years, the school's longest-serving governor), devoted a great deal of her time and energy to the subject of comprehensive education. </p> <p>She was president of the Socialist Education Association, co-founder of the Campaign for Comprehensive Education and a member of the Inner London Education Authority (1970-77). With Professor Brian Simon, she wrote Halfway There (1970), a report on the British comprehensive system, and she followed it up with another co-authorship, with Professor Clyde Chitty, on the same subject, Thirty Years On (1997). </p> <p>In the meantime, she also co-wrote Higher Education For Everyone (1982). Her best known book was a biography of Keir Hardie (1992). In 1980, she made a television film, Carry On Comprehensives, and she also wrote a novel, Lion In A Den Of Daniels, about an American girl in London. A tutor at the Open University, she was a lecturer at Ken- sington and Hammersmith Further Education College from 1970 to 1996. </p> <p>She is survived by her husband, her children Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua, and 10 grandchildren. </p> <p><strong> Professor Clyde Chitty writes: </strong> I first met Caroline Benn in 1966. I was in London, just down from Leicester University and keen to get involved with the Comprehensive Schools Committee. Thus it was that I joined the CSC, then operating from the Benn family home in Holland Park Avenue. I was to work with her on education for the next three decades. </p> <p>The CSC had been founded the previous year. It was the time of the new Labour government's circular 10/65, which requested local authorities to put forward plans for comprehensivisation. By the end of a CSC day, I could be pretty tired. Not so Caroline, then bringing up four children; hers was an unbelievable energy, and she had a wonderful sense of humour. </p> <p>I am a person who likes order. Caroline, meanwhile, would be surrounded by vast mounds of material and seemed disorganised, but she could always find what she wanted. Anthony Crosland was then Labour's secretary of state for education and science, and civil servants - and Crosland - would ring Caroline for advice; they did so because she had developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of comprehensives around the country. Her book, Halfway There, was the first major study on the subject. From those days in the 1960s, into the late 1990s, we worked together and edited Comprehensive Education, complete with its annual survey of the state of schools. </p> <p>Caroline saw the British education system with a foreigner's eyes. She hated British divisiveness and elitism, and, when her own children were at Holland Park comprehensive, she wanted the best for them, and for the school - and for that best to be extended to all. Utterly informal, with that American vitality, she was classless. With her, there was none of that \"presence\", that sense of being with someone important. She could relate to anyone. </p> <p>I will think of her standing in front of my classes in south-east London. I think of one Friday afternoon in particular, in Penge.

One of the two dissenting voices was the Greek judge on the panel.</p> <p>At stake is a trio of exquisite palaces and estates which the Greek government claims were obtained by Constan tine's ancestors under dubious circumstances.</p> <p>They include the sprawling estate of Tatoi, just outside Athens, where the royal cemetery is located; Mon Repos, the glorious summer retreat on Corfu where the Duke of Edinburgh was born; and the Polydendri forest estate situated in the foothills of Mount Olympus. The estimated value of the property, thought to total 34,000 acres, is around \u00a3300m.</p> <p>Speaking yesterday at his home in Hampstead, Constantine, who is godfather to Prince William, proclaimed himself \"extremely grateful\" to the court in France.</p> <p>In a statement, he denied the objective was to secure a cash settlement. \"We would like to avoid any burden on the taxpayers of Greece,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That would be achieved if the government were to return our home, the graves of our parents and ancestors, and our property. That is our primary aim.\"</p> <p>The Greek government made it clear yesterday that it was unlikely to hand back any of the disputed property but would reluctantly now start to think about some kind of financial compensation.</p> <p>\"I believe that the whole issue from the beginning was financial and about the hundreds of billions [of drachmas] he was asking for,\" Elisavet Papazoi, the country's deputy foreign minister, said.</p> <p>In a sign that the Greek government may be unwilling to settle amicably with Constantine, she also claimed that the ex-king would now be liable to pay tax on the disputed properties. It remained unclear last night how much this might be.</p> <p>Constantine is believed to be looking for a settlement in the region of \u00a31bn. The Strasbourg court did not name a figure, instead giving the two parties six months to come to an agreement.</p> <p>The Greek monarchy was formally abolished after a 1973 referendum and their land was expropriated. This expropriation was reversed in 1979, but in 1994, the socialist government confiscated Constantine's property to ensure that it could never be used to reestablish his family in Greece.</p> <p>Ironically, Constantine has enjoyed a higher profile in Greece of late after being appointed an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee to promote Athens as a venue for the 2004 games.</p> <p>But he has dared to return to his homeland only twice since 1967 - the first time for his mother's funeral in 1981 and the second time in 1993, when his yacht was chased out of Greek waters by gunboats and fighter planes.</p> <p>His case is not the only one involving ex-royals to be heard before the Strasbourg court - Italy's former royal family is seeking to overturn a 54-year-old ban forbidding its male heirs from stepping on to Italian soil.</p>",

The ruling is a severe embarrassment to the current Greek government which has disputed the claim and is loath to give him a single drachma. The margin of his victory is likely to rankle with Athens - the claim was approved by a 15 -2 margin. One of the two dissenting voices was the Greek judge on the panel. At stake is a trio of exquisite palaces and estates which the Greek government claims were obtained by Constan tine's ancestors under dubious circumstances. They include the sprawling estate of Tatoi, just outside Athens, where the royal cemetery is located; Mon Repos, the glorious summer retreat on Corfu where the Duke of Edinburgh was born; and the Polydendri forest estate situated in the foothills of Mount Olympus. The estimated value of the property, thought to total 34,000 acres, is around \u00a3300m. Speaking yesterday at his home in Hampstead, Constantine, who is godfather to Prince William, proclaimed himself \"extremely grateful\" to the court in France. In a statement, he denied the objective was to secure a cash settlement. \"We would like to avoid any burden on the taxpayers of Greece,\" he said. \"That would be achieved if the government were to return our home, the graves of our parents and ancestors, and our property. That is our primary aim.\" The Greek government made it clear yesterday that it was unlikely to hand back any of the disputed property but would reluctantly now start to think about some kind of financial compensation. \"I believe that the whole issue from the beginning was financial and about the hundreds of billions [of drachmas] he was asking for,\" Elisavet Papazoi, the country's deputy foreign minister, said. In a sign that the Greek government may be unwilling to settle amicably with Constantine, she also claimed that the ex-king would now be liable to pay tax on the disputed properties. It remained unclear last night how much this might be. Constantine is believed to be looking for a settlement in the region of \u00a31bn. The Strasbourg court did not name a figure, instead giving the two parties six months to come to an agreement. The Greek monarchy was formally abolished after a 1973 referendum and their land was expropriated. This expropriation was reversed in 1979, but in 1994, the socialist government confiscated Constantine's property to ensure that it could never be used to reestablish his family in Greece. Ironically, Constantine has enjoyed a higher profile in Greece of late after being appointed an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee to promote Athens as a venue for the 2004 games. But he has dared to return to his homeland only twice since 1967 - the first time for his mother's funeral in 1981 and the second time in 1993, when his yacht was chased out of Greek waters by gunboats and fighter planes. His case is not the only one involving ex-royals to be heard before the Strasbourg court - Italy's former royal family is seeking to overturn a 54-year-old ban forbidding its male heirs from stepping on to Italian soil.",

      "body": "<p>The Children's Society launches a timely blast at the disgraceful treatment of child offenders. Those who visit and inspect young offenders institutions are rendered almost speechless by much of what they see. After the horrors of Feltham, two more - Stoke Heath and Brinsford - will come under savage attack by the chief inspector of prisons shortly. Scores of violent, deeply damaged, angry and hopeless boys fight and bully each other, driving the vulnerable sometimes to suicide, with 994 incidents of self-harm reported last year alone - eating glass, cutting their wrists, banging their heads against walls. It is almost unthinkable that Britain has returned to a regime far worse than the borstals that were closed down 30 years ago. </p> <p>Britain locks up more teenagers than any other European country. The age of criminal responsibility has been reduced to 10: even Turkey, the next lowest, fixes it at 12. The number of young people in prison custody rose by 11% this year - another 3,000 when crime has been falling for six years. </p> <p>Most unjust of all are the 653 children and young people remanded in custody before their trials. \"You cannot imagine the state they are in,\" says one inspector. He takes a case he observed: a 15-year-old arrested on a Friday was thrown into police cells for the weekend - no proper meals, no clothes, no contact, completely neglected. The boy was homeless, an escapee from care. On Monday he was handed over to a private escort company which took nine hours to take him to prison. (Most are far from home towns.) It was evening and he was thrown straight into a cell and left. \"He was a zombie by then.\" From the next morning he was bullied and within two days he had his jaw smashed by an out-of-control 17-year-old. </p> <p>The system cannot cope and many are locked in for 23 hours a day, just to keep order. On remand, most get nothing in the way of treatment, education or care. The average time between arrest and sentencing is 90 days. The gross abuse by the state of these children on remand is the worst scandal. The condition of many of those already sentenced is often scarcely better. </p> <p>The Home Office response to the Children's Society and to Sir David Ramsbotham, chief inspector of prisons, is utterly inadequate. You have to understand, they say, these children are not little angels. Many are hardened criminals from criminal families who will never escape a life of crime. Many are one-boy crime waves, since 25% of youth crime is committed by just 3% of these teenagers. Norman Warner, chair of the youth justice board, put out a press release accusing the Children's Society of being \"unrealistic in suggesting that no young persons under 18 should ever be imprisoned\". </p> <p>But no one is suggesting some of them shouldn't be locked up. The issue is how many, where, and under what regime - in secure units run by local authorities with a duty of care, or by hard-pressed, under-resourced prisons that turn the already disturbed madder and badder. The refusal of the courts to send the Bulger killers from a secure unit into a prison highlighted the sharp difference in regime - one is curative, at least in intent if not always in practice, while the other is containment in violent sin bins. </p> <p>Behind all this is the government's usual peculiar ambivalence about doing good. In public it talks up prison and punishment, but in private it tries to do the right thing. The result is always the worst of all worlds. Gordon Brown does it too: he makes impassioned speeches about his progressive benefit increases to groups concerned with poverty, but talks prudence and business-friendly policy to the world at large. This double message ends up as no message about how remarkably well the poorest have fared. </p> <p> S o too, Jack Straw talks tough about juvenile offenders - boasting that ratboys who used to be cautioned and let go are now being seized and dealt with at once. He makes even the good he does sound tough for fear of sounding soft. </p> <p>The cheap populism of his language has two bad effects. First, the magistrates and judges are always hyper- sensitive to every home secretary's message. Prison populations soared as soon as Michael Howard began his \"prison works\" ranting. Since Jack Straw's regime began, 9% fewer crimes have been prosecuted, yet prison numbers have swelled because magistrates dished out more and longer sentences in response to the message from his lips. So as prisons fill, the regimes struggle harder to provide anything that might prevent criminals reoffending when they get out. </p> <p>The second effect is that few who might be interested get to hear about the good the government is doing within the rest of the juvenile crime system. They hear Jack Straw's words and assume his entire programme is a Howard replica. But on the ground, good things are happening that should mean, eventually, that many fewer young people will end up behind bars. </p> <p>Norman Warner's youth justice board oversees a whole new system that for the first time brings constructive sense to the way the young are treated. From last April, 155 youth offending teams in every area have pooled local budgets and staff so that teachers, doctors, police, probation and social workers concerned with one child or one family draw up a plan together to coordinate education, training, anger-management, cognitive behaviour or drug treat ment courses right from the first offence. For those given a new half- custody, half-community sentence, the same team runs the whole plan seamlessly, inside and out. </p> <p>Jack Straw sounded punitive at the Labour conference, but he announced one of the most hopeful programmes for keeping the young out of prison. Starting next April, 2,500 of the worst juveniles (four or more offences) will get intensive surveillance and supervision programmes instead of custody. On electronic tags or reporting in from voice-recognition telephones, they will be forced to attend courses for at least 25 hours a week, curfewing often chaotic lives, teaching a better life in the community instead of how to be worse in prison. Currently 90% of young prisoners reoffend on release. If all this works, there is a reasonable chance many fewer will be locked up and fewer will reoffend. </p> <p>But Labour and Jack Straw will get no credit for any of this while so many of the young are locked away in shameful conditions. Prison for juveniles costs \u00a3800 a week - barely enough for containment and far too little for the treatment they need. Better (though variable) local authority secure units cost \u00a33,500. This comes down to money and high-quality staff and both must be found at once. The conditions some of these children are kept in breach the UN convention on the rights of the child, and the Children Act. If they were animals, the RSPCA would sue. It's no use the Home Office telling us how horrible these young criminals are. All that matters is making them better, not worse. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com \">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com </a></p>",

Jack Straw sounded punitive at the Labour conference, but he announced one of the most hopeful programmes for keeping the young out of prison. Starting next April, 2,500 of the worst juveniles (four or more offences) will get intensive surveillance and supervision programmes instead of custody. On electronic tags or reporting in from voice-recognition telephones, they will be forced to attend courses for at least 25 hours a week, curfewing often chaotic lives, teaching a better life in the community instead of how to be worse in prison. Currently 90% of young prisoners reoffend on release. If all this works, there is a reasonable chance many fewer will be locked up and fewer will reoffend. But Labour and Jack Straw will get no credit for any of this while so many of the young are locked away in shameful conditions. Prison for juveniles costs \u00a3800 a week - barely enough for containment and far too little for the treatment they need. Better (though variable) local authority secure units cost \u00a33,500. This comes down to money and high-quality staff and both must be found at once. The conditions some of these children are kept in breach the UN convention on the rights of the child, and the Children Act. If they were animals, the RSPCA would sue. It's no use the Home Office telling us how horrible these young criminals are. All that matters is making them better, not worse. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

The audit commission calls for a halt to extra spending through the standards fund, the main lever used by the education secretary, David Blunkett, to inject cash into priorities such as literacy and numeracy. The commission urges the government to take stock before ordering councils to delegate more money to schools. Ministers ordered councils to devolve 80% of their education budgets to schools last year and 85% this year, and want most councils to reach 90%.

In particular, they must ask whether schools will be able to plan ahead effectively if a large proportion of their funding is short term and for specific activities.\" Rather than extending the use of standards funds, government should evaluate whether they were the most effective way to deliver national priorities, it says According to a commission survey, most headteachers welcomed the extra money in the standards fund, but complained of confusion about when it could be spent, a lack of flexibility and problems with planning ahead. The report also urges a let-up in pressure on councils to release more money to schools - from government on the one hand, and from headteachers' associations on the other. Many schools \"had limited benefit\" from the latest round of delegation. Headteachers and governors in England and Wales now control 82% of money spent on schools - 10 years ago most controlled less than 5%. Ministers have been ratcheting up the requirements on councils to devolve money to schools but the commission reports that three-quarters of headteachers were happy with their local education authority's level of delegation.

Paul McCreesh's buoyant and sensitive recording has a British cast and does magnificent justice to the melodic invention: Susan Gritton as the martyred virgin and Robin Blaze and Paul Agnew as Didymus and Septimius are all effective, while Susan Bickley proves herself one of the finest mezzo-sopranos of her generation.</p> <p> <strong>Nuits d'Etoiles: Songs by Faur\u00e9, Debussy and Poulenc</strong><br> Gens/Vignoles <br>(Virgin, \u00a312.99)<br> French soprano V\u00e9ronique Gens is one of the finest Mozart singers around, but these 19th-century m\u00e9lodies show that her range is far greater. She inhabits the varied worlds of these songs with conviction, whether in the delicate phrasing in Faur\u00e9's Apr\u00e8s un R\u00eave or the deft dispatch of Poulenc's Banalit\u00e9s. Roger Vignoles accompanies with tact and assertiveness.</p> <p> <strong>Messiaen: Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus</strong><br> Aimard <br>(Teldec, 2 CDs, \u00a327.99) <br> As a teenager Pierre-Laurent Aimard studied with Messiaen and his wife Yvonne Loriod. His performance of Messiaen's monumental solo piano piece has a sense of sovereign command, not only of the work's prodigious technical challenges but also of the devotional purpose of the cycle. Aimard brings the work to life in a way that no one has ever managed on record. </p> <p><strong>Mahler/Cooke: Symphony No 10</strong><br> Berlin Philharmonic/Rattle (EMI, \u00a313.99)<br> This consummate version of Mahler's final symphony, in the performing version that the English musicologist Deryck Cooke made from the surviving sketches, demonstrates that the work belongs firmly in the Mahler canon. Rattle recorded it at the start of his career, but this version outstrips its predecessor in the orchestral playing and its grasp of structure and detail, and in the way that Mahler's last emotional journey in music is so heart-wrenchingly charted. </p> <p><strong>Lindberg: Aura; Engine</strong><br> BBC Symphony/London Sinfonietta/Knussen<br> (Deutsche Grammophon, \u00a313.99)<br> Aura is the most important addition to Magnus Lindberg's discography. Completed in 1994, it marries Lindberg's mastery of the orchestra with superb control of a form that has the ghost of a one-movement symphony behind it. Chamber-like instrumental transparency alternates with textures of awesome power and the musical argument is always lucid. This is a wonderful performance from the BBC Symphony under Oliver Knussen, and the coupling of the dynamic Engine is equally compelling.</p> <p> <strong>Massenet: Thaos</strong><br> Fleming/Hampson/Bourdeaux Aquitaine National Orchestra/Abel <br>(Decca, 2 CDs, \u00a329.99)<br> Thaos has been dismissed as an over-exotic concoction, designed to cash in on the late 19th century's fascination with all things oriental, and carrying a whiff of smuttiness with it. But this sumptuous version, idiomatically conducted by Yves Abel, with Ren\u00e9e Fleming creamily seductive in the title role, demonstrates that it can still be forged into a convincing dramatic unity, with many gorgeous tunes.</p> <p> <strong>Elgar/Payne: Symphony No 3</strong><br> Bournemouth Symphony/Daniel <br>(Naxos, \u00a34.99)<br> Since it appeared in 1998, Anthony Payne's masterly \"elaboration\" of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony has become a repertory piece with bewildering speed. Andrew Davis recorded the work at the time of the premiere, and Paul Daniel has been able to build upon what Davis drew out of the music. In many ways Daniel is more daring than his predecessor - he can give a greater sweep to the first movement, dig deeper into the Adagio and drive the finale home with greater certainty.</p> <p> <strong>Bach: Goldberg Variations </strong><br>Hewitt (Hyperion, \u00a313.99)<br> Angela Hewitt's version of the Goldberg Variations is the best of the year's tributes on the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. She makes the best possible case for persisting with Bach's keyboard works on the piano, even in these days of period performance, but it is her sheer concentration and musicianship that distinguish this performance - the best on disc since Glenn Gould, and there can be no higher praise than that.</p> <p> <strong>Tchaikovsky: Piano Trio Op 50</strong><br> Richter/Kagan/Gutman<br> (Live Classics, \u00a310.99)<br> The number of discs that Sviatoslav Richter made in the studio is being outstripped by the recordings of his concerts and recitals that have emerged in a steady stream since his death three years ago. Richter was as great a chamber musician as he was a solo pianist, and this incandescent account of the monumental Tchaikovsky Trio is a thrilling example of his interpretative powers. It is released in a series devoted to the achievement of the violinist Oleg Kagan, and fine though both his playing and that of the cellist Natalia Gutman is, Richter dominates the performance.</p> <p> <strong>Beethoven: Piano Sonatas Opp 57; 101; 109; 110</strong><br> Solomon (Testament, \u00a310.99)<br> Every one of the 18 Beethoven sonatas that this great British pianist recorded before a stroke forced him to give up playing in 1956 is now available on CD, and this selection contains arguably the finest performances of all. The purity and naturalness of Solomon's playing makes his account of the Appassionata Sonata Op 57 a wonderfully contained experience, though his command of the A major Op 101 demonstrates that all the technical resources were there when he needed them. But it's the simple poetry he brings to Op 109 and 110 that is so special. Both the beguilingly simple floating of the opening of Op 109 and the unfolding of the fugue in the last movement of Op 110 are the achievement of a supreme artist.</p>",

Bach: Goldberg Variations Hewitt (Hyperion, \u00a313.99) Angela Hewitt's version of the Goldberg Variations is the best of the year's tributes on the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. She makes the best possible case for persisting with Bach's keyboard works on the piano, even in these days of period performance, but it is her sheer concentration and musicianship that distinguish this performance - the best on disc since Glenn Gould, and there can be no higher praise than that. Tchaikovsky: Piano Trio Op 50 Richter/Kagan/Gutman (Live Classics, \u00a310.99) The number of discs that Sviatoslav Richter made in the studio is being outstripped by the recordings of his concerts and recitals that have emerged in a steady stream since his death three years ago. Richter was as great a chamber musician as he was a solo pianist, and this incandescent account of the monumental Tchaikovsky Trio is a thrilling example of his interpretative powers. It is released in a series devoted to the achievement of the violinist Oleg Kagan, and fine though both his playing and that of the cellist Natalia Gutman is, Richter dominates the performance. Beethoven: Piano Sonatas Opp 57; 101; 109; 110 Solomon (Testament, \u00a310.99) Every one of the 18 Beethoven sonatas that this great British pianist recorded before a stroke forced him to give up playing in 1956 is now available on CD, and this selection contains arguably the finest performances of all. The purity and naturalness of Solomon's playing makes his account of the Appassionata Sonata Op 57 a wonderfully contained experience, though his command of the A major Op 101 demonstrates that all the technical resources were there when he needed them. But it's the simple poetry he brings to Op 109 and 110 that is so special. Both the beguilingly simple floating of the opening of Op 109 and the unfolding of the fugue in the last movement of Op 110 are the achievement of a supreme artist.",

      "body": "<p>It's Christmas morning, and you've got in all the essentials - extra toilet-rolls and tea-bags for the oldies, the Christmas double issue of the Radio Times, a stack of blank video-cassettes, and a range of smorgasbits from M &amp; S. You rush downstairs - let's assume you have a downstairs, and an open fire, and plenty of room for a Christmas tree, and your own full set of crockery and nut-crackers, since let's be honest, Christmas in a small centrally-heated flat with only your commode, a few old photos, a bottle of syrup of figs, the Reader's Digest and a few pre-sliced butter-basted ready-meals for company is no fun, particularly if you're Father Christmas.</p> <p>You're ready to let rip with the old advocaat and lash into the presents - let's assume you have some presents. And let's assume also, for the sake of argument, that you're a reader of the Guardian. (These assumptions are not mutually exclusive.) Granted all of these comforting notions, there's a good chance that one of those little gift-wrapped goodies nestled among the fallen pine-needles is going to have a name-tag with your name written on it, and it is going to be a book. Why?</p> <p> Books are, of course, intended as gifts. Most of them are written with the intention of pleasing, even if that pleasure is marked by struggle and pain. Even Kafka, and Jeffrey Archer, set out to entertain, try as they might to avoid it. Writers are making an offering, which is why critics and reviewers are so unpopular: not only does the critic look the writer's gift horse in the mouth, he bashes its teeth in, ties it up by the hooves, sets fire to its tail, flenses, strips and butchers it, and boils up its bones for glue. </p> <p> Books are not only offered as gratuities, but are traditionally exchanged as gifts. What better way to tell your friends and family what you think of them or to announce how you see yourself than to spell it out clearly in black and white? If you were to gift-wrap Garrison Keillor's We Are Still Married, for example, and give it to your spouse, or were to pop Tim Parks's Adultery and Other Diversions into a jolly red Jiffy for your lover, you'd clearly be wanting to tell them something (and not the same thing as if you were to give your spouse Adultery and Other Diversions and your lover We Are Still Married).</p> <p>Certain books are of course simply not suitable as gifts. Excellent though they undoubtedly are, the new editions of <strong>What to Do When Someone Dies</strong> (Which? Books, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502346339,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) and <strong>Smith's General Urology</strong> (Appleton and Lange, \u00a329.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501003895,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) are probably unsuitable as stocking-fillers. </p> <p> Certain other books, though, are perfectly proper and appropriate. There is such a thing as the Christmas Book. Literally - JM Golby and AW Purdue's <strong>The Making of the Modern Christmas</strong> (Sutton, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450349,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), say, or John Van Der Kiste's <strong>Gilbert and Sullivan's Christmas</strong> (Sutton, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502328231,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) - and metaphorically. Publishers think like Scrooge - they believe Christmas is a miserable time, but are nonetheless happy to profit from it by publishing books in November that they expect us poor saps to rush out and buy as presents instead of Body Shop essential oils and HMV 2-for-\u00a322 CDs.</p> <p> Hence the current glut of \"humour\" books. Unfortunately, these are not funny, not even, alas, <strong>The Little Book of Mornington Crescent</strong> (Orion, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502363240,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), compiled by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Barry Cryer and Humphrey Lyttleton, let alone <strong>Ha Ha Ha Haa!: Quips, Quotes and Cartoons for Music Lovers </strong>(Robson, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450927,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). And poor Nick Page may have to find room for Natalie d'Arbeloff's <strong>The Joy of Letting Women Down: Secrets of the Worshipped Male</strong> (Robson, \u00a38.99) in future editions of his own <strong>In Search of the World's Worst Writers</strong> (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240579,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). The Literary Review's annual, <strong>Poetry 2000</strong> (Robson, \u00a38.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000324362,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), edited by Clarissa Burden and \"explained\" by Auberon Waugh, does at least raise a smile, but only Steven Appleby's <strong>Encyclopaedia of Personal Problems </strong>(Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99) knows its proper place: \"Buy this book and rush home to the privacy of your own privy.\" </p> <p> Since Christmas is probably the one time of year you can get away with taking drink during the day - unless you're already an alcoholic, or work in publishing - the best Christmas Books are those that are simple enough to read through a haze of Harvey's Bristol Cream, or perhaps a bottle of Kwik-Save Claret (\u00a33.50), as recommended in Malcom Gluck's <strong>Superplonk 2001</strong> (Hodder and Stoughton, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000304905,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), the proverbial Beano of the middle classes. </p> <p> Best of all, obviously, are books with no words at all - easily accessible to the incapacitated, and fans of Jim Davidson. Thus, presumably, the seasonal reissue of<strong> Hoffnung </strong>(The Hoffnung Companion to Music, Hoffnung's The Maestro, The Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra, Beer Davies, \u00a36.95 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501189948,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) and miscellaneous other soothing eye-pleasers, such as James Haspiel's <strong>The Unpublished Marilyn </strong>(Mainstream, \u00a320 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502334667,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), Terry Matz's <strong>Daybook of Saints </strong>(Mitchell Beazley, \u00a318.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453969,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), and <strong>Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings</strong> (Harry N. Abrams <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000338088,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), edited by Pietro C. Marani, a gorgeous book which requires its own dedicated coffee table. </p> <p> The next best thing to picture-books are books which consist of little bits of other books: the pick and mix, as it were, of Christmas Books. John Julius Norwich's <strong>Still More Christmas Crackers</strong> 1990-1999 (Viking, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000302177,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) is a classic, but does require updating. Where, one asks, as one is chuckling over all those toothsome selections from Walter Savage Landor and Christopher Smart, is the Christmas commonplace book for Generation X (but then again, would Generation X bother to read it)? Daisy Goodwin's<strong> 101 Poems To Get You Through the Day (and Night): A Survival Kit for Modern Life</strong> (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000092364,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), Michelle Lovric's <strong>Women's Wicked Wit</strong> (Prion, \u00a39.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000273218,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), \"chock-full of wicked witticisms by women of every kind\" and even Milton Shulman's <strong>Voltaire, Goldberg &amp; Others </strong>(Quartet Books, \u00a37 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502365846,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) all fall rather short of the mark. </p> <p> Not nearly so far or so wide, needless to say, as Gyles Brandreth's <strong>Great Party Games </strong>(Robson Books, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501691309,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), or Richard Whiteley's <strong>A Treasury of Words and Wordplay </strong>(Robson Books, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000409127,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), which are the publishing equivalent of a stint in panto at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch.

      "bodyText": "It's Christmas morning, and you've got in all the essentials - extra toilet-rolls and tea-bags for the oldies, the Christmas double issue of the Radio Times, a stack of blank video-cassettes, and a range of smorgasbits from M &amp; S. You rush downstairs - let's assume you have a downstairs, and an open fire, and plenty of room for a Christmas tree, and your own full set of crockery and nut-crackers, since let's be honest, Christmas in a small centrally-heated flat with only your commode, a few old photos, a bottle of syrup of figs, the Reader's Digest and a few pre-sliced butter-basted ready-meals for company is no fun, particularly if you're Father Christmas. You're ready to let rip with the old advocaat and lash into the presents - let's assume you have some presents. And let's assume also, for the sake of argument, that you're a reader of the Guardian. (These assumptions are not mutually exclusive.) Granted all of these comforting notions, there's a good chance that one of those little gift-wrapped goodies nestled among the fallen pine-needles is going to have a name-tag with your name written on it, and it is going to be a book. Why? Books are, of course, intended as gifts. Most of them are written with the intention of pleasing, even if that pleasure is marked by struggle and pain. Even Kafka, and Jeffrey Archer, set out to entertain, try as they might to avoid it. Writers are making an offering, which is why critics and reviewers are so unpopular: not only does the critic look the writer's gift horse in the mouth, he bashes its teeth in, ties it up by the hooves, sets fire to its tail, flenses, strips and butchers it, and boils up its bones for glue. Books are not only offered as gratuities, but are traditionally exchanged as gifts. What better way to tell your friends and family what you think of them or to announce how you see yourself than to spell it out clearly in black and white? If you were to gift-wrap Garrison Keillor's We Are Still Married, for example, and give it to your spouse, or were to pop Tim Parks's Adultery and Other Diversions into a jolly red Jiffy for your lover, you'd clearly be wanting to tell them something (and not the same thing as if you were to give your spouse Adultery and Other Diversions and your lover We Are Still Married). Certain books are of course simply not suitable as gifts. Excellent though they undoubtedly are, the new editions of What to Do When Someone Dies (Which? Books, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL) and Smith's General Urology (Appleton and Lange, \u00a329.99 Buy it at BOL) are probably unsuitable as stocking-fillers. Certain other books, though, are perfectly proper and appropriate. There is such a thing as the Christmas Book. Literally - JM Golby and AW Purdue's The Making of the Modern Christmas (Sutton, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL), say, or John Van Der Kiste's Gilbert and Sullivan's Christmas (Sutton, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL) - and metaphorically. Publishers think like Scrooge - they believe Christmas is a miserable time, but are nonetheless happy to profit from it by publishing books in November that they expect us poor saps to rush out and buy as presents instead of Body Shop essential oils and HMV 2-for-\u00a322 CDs. Hence the current glut of \"humour\" books. Unfortunately, these are not funny, not even, alas, The Little Book of Mornington Crescent (Orion, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL), compiled by Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Barry Cryer and Humphrey Lyttleton, let alone Ha Ha Ha Haa!: Quips, Quotes and Cartoons for Music Lovers (Robson, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL). And poor Nick Page may have to find room for Natalie d'Arbeloff's The Joy of Letting Women Down: Secrets of the Worshipped Male (Robson, \u00a38.99) in future editions of his own In Search of the World's Worst Writers (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL). The Literary Review's annual, Poetry 2000 (Robson, \u00a38.99 Buy it at BOL), edited by Clarissa Burden and \"explained\" by Auberon Waugh, does at least raise a smile, but only Steven Appleby's Encyclopaedia of Personal Problems (Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99) knows its proper place: \"Buy this book and rush home to the privacy of your own privy.\" Since Christmas is probably the one time of year you can get away with taking drink during the day - unless you're already an alcoholic, or work in publishing - the best Christmas Books are those that are simple enough to read through a haze of Harvey's Bristol Cream, or perhaps a bottle of Kwik-Save Claret (\u00a33.50), as recommended in Malcom Gluck's Superplonk 2001 (Hodder and Stoughton, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL), the proverbial Beano of the middle classes. Best of all, obviously, are books with no words at all - easily accessible to the incapacitated, and fans of Jim Davidson. Thus, presumably, the seasonal reissue of Hoffnung (The Hoffnung Companion to Music, Hoffnung's The Maestro, The Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra, Beer Davies, \u00a36.95 Buy it at BOL) and miscellaneous other soothing eye-pleasers, such as James Haspiel's The Unpublished Marilyn (Mainstream, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL), Terry Matz's Daybook of Saints (Mitchell Beazley, \u00a318.99 Buy it at BOL), and Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings (Harry N. Abrams Buy it at BOL), edited by Pietro C. Marani, a gorgeous book which requires its own dedicated coffee table. The next best thing to picture-books are books which consist of little bits of other books: the pick and mix, as it were, of Christmas Books. John Julius Norwich's Still More Christmas Crackers 1990-1999 (Viking, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL) is a classic, but does require updating. Where, one asks, as one is chuckling over all those toothsome selections from Walter Savage Landor and Christopher Smart, is the Christmas commonplace book for Generation X (but then again, would Generation X bother to read it)? Daisy Goodwin's 101 Poems To Get You Through the Day (and Night): A Survival Kit for Modern Life (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL), Michelle Lovric's Women's Wicked Wit (Prion, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL), \"chock-full of wicked witticisms by women of every kind\" and even Milton Shulman's Voltaire, Goldberg &amp; Others (Quartet Books, \u00a37 Buy it at BOL) all fall rather short of the mark. Not nearly so far or so wide, needless to say, as Gyles Brandreth's Great Party Games (Robson Books, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL), or Richard Whiteley's A Treasury of Words and Wordplay (Robson Books, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL), which are the publishing equivalent of a stint in panto at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch. Other minor celebrities treading the seasonal boards include Helen Yemm, \"presenter of the popular BBC series Gardening from Scratch\", with her saucy Gardening in your Nightie (Ebury Press, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL), and the fragrant Pat Archer - otherwise known as Patricia Gallimore - getting her hands dirty with her Organic Year (BBC Worldwide, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL). Boze Hadleigh plays the wicked stepmother in Celebrity Feuds: The Cattiest Rows, Spats and Tiffs Ever Recorded (Robson Books, \u00a38.99 Buy it at BOL). At that time of year when the mind turns naturally towards thoughts of eternity, we may wish to read the lives of great men and women and to draw deeply upon the lessons contained therein. Hence Benny Hill: King Leer, by Jeremy Norvick (Carlton Books, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL), the \"fully updated edition\" of Noddy Holder's Who's Crazee Now? (Ebury Press, \u00a35.99 Buy it at BOL), John Mortimer's The Summer of a Dormouse: A Year of Growing Old Disgracefully (Viking, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL), George Melly's Fishing Memories (Robson Books, \u00a314.95 Buy it at BOL), and Forever Liesl: My Sound of Music Story (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL) by Charmian Carr, the one who sang I Am Sixteen, Going On Seventeen in the film, and who seems never to have got over it.

      "body": "<p>Christmas presents something of a problem for the publisher or bookshop keen to make an impact on the bestseller lists with a sly novel or two. For a start, not a great deal of fiction is published in the dying months of the year; the push to capture the summer holiday market is long gone, the fizz of the Booker Prize is fading, and attention is already focused on the big releases for January and the next round of lists, awards, magazine profiles and TV interviews.</p> <p> Even worse, novels make tricky gifts, being neither visually impressive in the manner of a lavishly illustrated work on gardening or interior decoration, nor bearing the obvious intellectual weight of a thumping great tome of history or biography. There's the horribly nuanced matter of gauging another's taste - you wouldn't want to disappoint a Nick Hornby fan with the latest AS Byatt, for example. And there's an absence of immediate gratification with a novel - parading around in a pristine sweater or shoving on a new CD makes for easier overt appreciation, after all.</p> <p> Those caveats in mind, a hardback novel is still, for many, a luxury, suggesting expense and several hours' absorbed leisure. Given thoughtfully, a good novel can easily outlast the more showy presents. So here's a guide to some of those most likely to be crackers rather than turkeys.</p> <p> Let's start with the inevitable miseries and neuroses that accompany extended periods of togetherness and festivity. Any harassed parent would be grateful for Helen Simpson's <strong>Hey Yeah Right Get A Life</strong> (Cape, \u00a314.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240048,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) - short stories, in fact, exquisitely written meditations on the end of freedom and frivolity that children betoken. Those anticipating a less than smooth ride on the romantic rollercoaster will also enjoy Julian Barnes's eternal triangulations in <strong>Love, etc</strong> (Cape, \u00a315.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501939285,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). </p> <p>To complete the \"bah, humbug\" effect, this year's novels come no more misanthropic than Michel Houellebecq's extraordinary <strong>Atomised</strong> (Heinemann, \u00a312.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502411363,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), a brilliant work of nihilism that predicts a gloomy end to sexual, social and scientific decadence. It would sit well with JG Ballard's <strong>Super-Cannes</strong> (Flamingo, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502454390,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), another dystopian view of the world.</p> <p>There is, of course, lighter fare. Of the veteran novelists who published this year, Muriel Spark beat all-comers for lightness of touch and deviant wit. <strong>Aiding and Abetting</strong> (Viking, \u00a312.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452433,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), her imagined history of Lord Lucan post-nanny-bashing, is both comic caper and serious meditation on the nature of psychopathy: in Lucan's case, evil turns out to be rather banal and somewhat boring - what you might expect, one supposes, of a man who ate only smoked salmon and lamb chops every day of his adult life. A gentler sort of comedy comes from the woefully overlooked Laurie Graham. The wonderfully titled <strong>Dog Days, Glenn Miller Nights</strong> (Black Swan, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502145044,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) marries nostalgia and nervy present-day East End life in the person of Birdie Gibbs, a pensioner with attitude, whose talent for the one-liner makes her more than a match for the teenagers who terrorise the walkways of the Fruit Bowl estate. </p> <p> Gentler still is Ben Sherwood's debut novel <strong>The Man Who Ate the 747</strong> (Picador, \u00a312 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000094523,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) - which does exactly what it says on the tin. If this year's Booker Prize shortlist is anything to go by, judges and reading public still like the past. Several novelists looked to history for inspiration most notably, perhaps, in Booker winner and finalist respectively, Margaret Atwood's<strong> The Blind Assassin</strong> (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453121,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) and Kazuo Ishiguro's<strong> When We Were Orphans </strong>(Faber, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502387740,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). </p> <p> The Orange prizewinner was Linda Grant's <strong>When I Lived in Modern Times</strong> (Granta, \u00a36.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000427528,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), which launched a young Jewess into the zealotry and political activity of 1940s Palestine. Grant's subject was the ungovernability of passion and the complexity of personal and public identity, but her novel also managed to be delicately witty and a surprisingly light read, in the best sense of the word. Grant rather notably won over the bookies' favourite, Zadie Smith, whose debut novel <strong>White Teeth</strong> (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501018632,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) wrong-footed the critics who expect all precocious talent to squander itself on slim metropolitan docunovels or modishly ironic fairy-tales. Here was a whacking great family saga, replete with comedy and seriousness, linguistically playful and yet thoroughly intent on telling a story. White Teeth has not yet won Smith any gongs, but it has secured her an enviable reputation as the Next Big Thing - a mantle she might have to share for a while with <strong>Trezza Azzopardi</strong> (The Hiding Place, Picador, \u00a314.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502156860,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) and <strong>Mark Z Danielewski </strong>(House of Leaves, Doubleday, \u00a313 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502429515,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). </p> <p> Amazon's reader comments reveal that Smith is a big fan of John Lanchester. In fact, she claims, she wishes she had written his <strong>Mr Phillips</strong> (Faber, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502455613,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) herself - quite a tribute for a book that divided critical opinion. Was his deceptively simple tale of a redundant accountant wandering the London streets in a state of amiable alienation a triumph for the miniaturist or a detour up the garden path? A matter of taste, in the end, but Lanchester is certainly one of the most interesting and intelligent of novelists to watch, and re-read. </p> <p> Honourable mentions are also due to the excellent Julie Myerson, on top form in a Victorian setting in <strong>Laura Blundy</strong> (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502365756,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>); Michel Faber for his startling <strong>Under the Skin </strong>(Canongate, \u00a310 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502356345,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>); John Banville for <strong>Eclipse</strong> (Picador, \u00a315.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502156824,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>); Lawrence Norfolk for<strong> In The Shape of a Boar </strong>(Weidenfeld and Nicolson, \u00a316.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450694,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>); and to the posthumous short stories of the much-lamented Penelope Fitzgerald, <strong>The Means of Escape</strong> (Flamingo, \u00a312.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093447,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). </p> <p> The first year of the millennium saw another decisive retort to the pessimist's claim that the novel is languishing in the doldrums - each and any of these titles will guarantee a prompt thank you note, whoever's stocking they fill.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christmas presents something of a problem for the publisher or bookshop keen to make an impact on the bestseller lists with a sly novel or two. For a start, not a great deal of fiction is published in the dying months of the year; the push to capture the summer holiday market is long gone, the fizz of the Booker Prize is fading, and attention is already focused on the big releases for January and the next round of lists, awards, magazine profiles and TV interviews. Even worse, novels make tricky gifts, being neither visually impressive in the manner of a lavishly illustrated work on gardening or interior decoration, nor bearing the obvious intellectual weight of a thumping great tome of history or biography. There's the horribly nuanced matter of gauging another's taste - you wouldn't want to disappoint a Nick Hornby fan with the latest AS Byatt, for example. And there's an absence of immediate gratification with a novel - parading around in a pristine sweater or shoving on a new CD makes for easier overt appreciation, after all. Those caveats in mind, a hardback novel is still, for many, a luxury, suggesting expense and several hours' absorbed leisure. Given thoughtfully, a good novel can easily outlast the more showy presents. So here's a guide to some of those most likely to be crackers rather than turkeys. Let's start with the inevitable miseries and neuroses that accompany extended periods of togetherness and festivity. Any harassed parent would be grateful for Helen Simpson's Hey Yeah Right Get A Life (Cape, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL) - short stories, in fact, exquisitely written meditations on the end of freedom and frivolity that children betoken. Those anticipating a less than smooth ride on the romantic rollercoaster will also enjoy Julian Barnes's eternal triangulations in Love, etc (Cape, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL). To complete the \"bah, humbug\" effect, this year's novels come no more misanthropic than Michel Houellebecq's extraordinary Atomised (Heinemann, \u00a312.99 Buy it at BOL), a brilliant work of nihilism that predicts a gloomy end to sexual, social and scientific decadence. It would sit well with JG Ballard's Super-Cannes (Flamingo, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL), another dystopian view of the world. There is, of course, lighter fare. Of the veteran novelists who published this year, Muriel Spark beat all-comers for lightness of touch and deviant wit. Aiding and Abetting (Viking, \u00a312.99 Buy it at BOL), her imagined history of Lord Lucan post-nanny-bashing, is both comic caper and serious meditation on the nature of psychopathy: in Lucan's case, evil turns out to be rather banal and somewhat boring - what you might expect, one supposes, of a man who ate only smoked salmon and lamb chops every day of his adult life. A gentler sort of comedy comes from the woefully overlooked Laurie Graham. The wonderfully titled Dog Days, Glenn Miller Nights (Black Swan, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL) marries nostalgia and nervy present-day East End life in the person of Birdie Gibbs, a pensioner with attitude, whose talent for the one-liner makes her more than a match for the teenagers who terrorise the walkways of the Fruit Bowl estate. Gentler still is Ben Sherwood's debut novel The Man Who Ate the 747 (Picador, \u00a312 Buy it at BOL) - which does exactly what it says on the tin. If this year's Booker Prize shortlist is anything to go by, judges and reading public still like the past. Several novelists looked to history for inspiration most notably, perhaps, in Booker winner and finalist respectively, Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL) and Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans (Faber, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL). The Orange prizewinner was Linda Grant's When I Lived in Modern Times (Granta, \u00a36.99 Buy it at BOL), which launched a young Jewess into the zealotry and political activity of 1940s Palestine. Grant's subject was the ungovernability of passion and the complexity of personal and public identity, but her novel also managed to be delicately witty and a surprisingly light read, in the best sense of the word. Grant rather notably won over the bookies' favourite, Zadie Smith, whose debut novel White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99 Buy it at BOL) wrong-footed the critics who expect all precocious talent to squander itself on slim metropolitan docunovels or modishly ironic fairy-tales. Here was a whacking great family saga, replete with comedy and seriousness, linguistically playful and yet thoroughly intent on telling a story. White Teeth has not yet won Smith any gongs, but it has secured her an enviable reputation as the Next Big Thing - a mantle she might have to share for a while with Trezza Azzopardi (The Hiding Place, Picador, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL) and Mark Z Danielewski (House of Leaves, Doubleday, \u00a313 Buy it at BOL). Amazon's reader comments reveal that Smith is a big fan of John Lanchester. In fact, she claims, she wishes she had written his Mr Phillips (Faber, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL) herself - quite a tribute for a book that divided critical opinion. Was his deceptively simple tale of a redundant accountant wandering the London streets in a state of amiable alienation a triumph for the miniaturist or a detour up the garden path? A matter of taste, in the end, but Lanchester is certainly one of the most interesting and intelligent of novelists to watch, and re-read. Honourable mentions are also due to the excellent Julie Myerson, on top form in a Victorian setting in Laura Blundy (Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL); Michel Faber for his startling Under the Skin (Canongate, \u00a310 Buy it at BOL); John Banville for Eclipse (Picador, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL); Lawrence Norfolk for In The Shape of a Boar (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL); and to the posthumous short stories of the much-lamented Penelope Fitzgerald, The Means of Escape (Flamingo, \u00a312.99 Buy it at BOL). The first year of the millennium saw another decisive retort to the pessimist's claim that the novel is languishing in the doldrums - each and any of these titles will guarantee a prompt thank you note, whoever's stocking they fill.",

Books which are the modern equivalent of the lullaby don't come more enchanting than this. Simplicity is the keynote, both in the everyday magic of the text and the drawings. Burningham manages to capture exactly what a fish looks like heavy-eyed with sleep, or how comfy the man in the moon is as he settles down for the night. This book takes the reader from sleepiness to sleep itself. </p> <p><strong>My Dad </strong><br> Anthony Browne<br> (Doubleday, \u00a39.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502413420,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Here's a chance to introduce the very youngest members of the family to Browne's sideways looks at the world. He always sees the extraordinary in the most ordinary lives; here a dad, who never succeeds in getting out of his dressing gown, manages to see off a wolf, dance the tango, replace one of the three tenors and do long division, all before breakfast. There is a great sense of humour at work, in bold visual jokes that keep children alert and stop parents dropping off during repeated readings. </p> <p><strong>The Obvious Elephant </strong><br> Bruce Robinson and Sophie Windham<br> (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000325465,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> \"Imagine a town, in a country, where a simple thing like an elephant had never been seen, or even heard of.\" That's the tantalising start to this completely enchanting and thought-provoking tale about an elephant that turns up one day. Nobody knows what to do with it. Should they plug it in, using it as a railway engine or vacuum cleaner? Only a little boy called Eric knows what the creature is, and nobody will listen to him. </p> <p> <strong>The Very Small </strong><br> Joyce Dunbar, illustrated by Debi Gliori<br> (Doubleday, \u00a310.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000091057,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> When Giant Baby Bear is out he finds a Very Small. It looks like a cross between one of Peter Pan's Lost Boys, Thumbelina and an elf. And in Debi Gliori's enchanting illustrations it is irresistible, even to Giant Baby Bear (pretty cute too) who makes Very Small a playground, a bath in a soapdish and dinner (one whole pea). They snuggle down, but it only takes a sneeze from Bear for Very Small to be blown back to his parents. The difference between big and small has never been delivered with such poetry. </p> <p><strong>Age 4-7 </strong></p> <p> <strong>Fairy Tales </strong><br> Berlie Doherty, illustrated by Jane Ray<br> (Walker, \u00a314.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093704,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Is it possible to make Cinderella sound fresh, or Beauty and the Beast seem new-minted? Berlie Doherty can. This wonderful book creates a jewel-like world of enchantment studded with Jane Ray's gold-encrusted, richly coloured drawings that pick up on the style and mood of each story. But it doesn't neglect the words. Doherty's prose is easy and stylish without being tricksy. </p> <p> <strong>Enchantment </strong><br>Kevin Crossley-Holland, illustrated by Emma Chichester Clark<br> (Orion, \u00a312.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452272,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Crossley-Holland retells old folk tales better then anyone else alive, and this selection of fairy tales, ghost stories and tales of wonder from throughout these isles is as good as anything he's done. It is nice to see children being taken seriously as an audience. The foolishness of humans is a recurrent theme where imps, ghosts and boggarts almost always have the last laugh. </p> <p> <strong>How the Whale Became and Other Stories </strong><br> Ted Hughes, illustrated by Jackie Morris<br> (Faber and Faber, \u00a317.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502388215,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>This book of Ted Hughes's inventive creation fables, first published in 1963, will give pleasure to your children all their lives. Hughes tells us how the tortoise always used to come first in any race, why the hare believes that the moon wants to marry him and why it took a while for the elephant to learn to be itself. Jackie Morris's illustrations display a rich, muted, almost medieval beauty.</p> <p><strong>Beware of the Storybook Wolves </strong><br> Lauren Child<br> (Hodder, \u00a39.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093041,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Lauren Child is a writer/illustrator who makes words dance and topography jitterbug and whose sly sense of humour makes both children and adults giggle. This is for anyone who has ever believed there might be a wolf under their bed and who worried that characters in books, particularly the nasty ones, might creep out in the night and get you.</p> <p><strong>Age 8-11 </strong></p> <p><strong>The Wind Singer </strong><br> William Nicholson<br> (Mammoth, \u00a312.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502413884,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> One of the best and most original books of the year, Nicholson's novel is set in a supposedly perfect society where everyone from the age of two is tested and given a personal rating that they must strive to improve. But Kestral rebels, and together with her twin brother and the smelly outcast Mumpo, sets off on a dangerous journey to find a way to liberate her homeland. This is a page-turning fantasy that clearly has its origins in our own world of Sats tests and league tables. A tough, cheering and inspiring story.</p> <p> <strong>A Handful of Magic </strong><br> Stephen Elboz <br>(Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502429083,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Werewolves at the Tower of London, flying carpets, dragons, London's underground network of tunnels and an aunt who lives in a house on top of St Paul's cathedral are just some of the ingredients in a book that has flashes of inspiration as frequently as flashes of magic. Elboz writes with real panache. A book to wonder at, but one which also makes you think about the nature of science and progress. </p> <p><strong>Charmed Life </strong><br> Diana Wynne Jones<br> (Collins, \u00a34.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502413450,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Eric Chant, known as Cat, thinks he is just an ordinary boy and that his sister is the gifted witch of the family. But when they are orphaned and whisked off to live in a magician's castle and the magician takes away his troublesome sister's magic, Cat discovers unexpected power. Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series, of which this is the first, date from the 70s and are becoming hotter than Potter with a new generation of readers.</p> <p><strong>Ella Enchanted </strong><br> Gail Carson Levine<br> (Collins, \u00a33.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502452386,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Magic turns out to be a dangerous thing in this wonderfully witty book. When Ella is born, the fairy Lucinda grants her a gift: obedience. It turns out to be more of a curse, as the unscrupulous discover that they can make Ella do anything they command. Levine's witty, artful fairytale is unputdownable.</p> <p> <strong>Age 12+ </strong></p> <p> <strong>Witch Child </strong><br> Celia Rees<br> (Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000000537,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The triumph of Rees's book, which takes the form of a 17th-century journal found sewn into the lining of a quilt 300 years later, is not just that it is a really good and cleverly constructed read. No, she also convincingly charts the psychology and political circumstances that engendered witch-hunts. Mary, a teenager whose adopted grandmother is executed as a witch in a small English village, thinks she is escaping to freedom when she sets sail with others for a fresh life in the New World. But survival is even more in doubt there. Rees writes with grace and urgency through to the convincingly ambiguous ending. </p> <p> <strong>Vicky Angel </strong><br> Jacqueline Wilson<br> (Doubleday, \u00a310.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000302035,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Wilson's gift is an instantly accessible prose style that taps into the raw emotions of her young heroines and readers, combined with an ability to write issue-based books that aren't the slightest bit preachy. Her latest deals with death and friendship, as Jade is faced with life without her best friend Vicky, suddenly killed in a road accident. But as teachers, parents and friends worry about Jade having to do everything alone, her real problem is that Vicky is still making them do everything together. She is being haunted. </p> <p><strong>Heaven Eyes</strong><br> David Almond <br>(Hodder, \u00a310) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502418029,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Erin, January and Mouse run away from a children's home and set sail. They are rescued by Heaven Eyes, a girl with webbed hands and feet who believes they are her lost siblings. Almond's eerie tale is an astonishing piece of writing about the way that the living and the dead find comfort in each other and about daring to go as far as death and having the courage to come back again. A very grown-up, totally compelling book that, like Almond's brilliant Skellig, is about the lost and found, abandonment and redemption, love and faith - particularly faith in yourself and others. </p> <p> <strong>A Long Way From Chicago</strong><br> Richard Peck<br> (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a33.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502381016,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> It is 1929 and Joey and his sister travel from the Chicago of Bugsy Malone and Al Capone to the hicksville town of their gran on what is to be the first of a yearly summer visit. Here in her parlour they see their first dead body. Peck's brilliant book, a series of interlinked short stories that telescope in time to 1942, has the polecat reek of authentic American fiction. It is full of characters with names such as Shotgun Cheetham, a gran who behaves with the recklessness of a frontier-town outlaw, and a wonderful sense of the way we all turn our lives into myth. Seen entirely through the eyes of the child, this is a great book about the way you grow up slower than you want - and faster than you realise.</p> <p> \u0095 For a fuller list, see <a href=\"http://www.books-unlimited.co.uk/childrenslibrary\"> www.books-unlimited.co.uk/childrenslibrary</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Age 0-3 Hushabye John Burningham (Jonathan Cape, \u00a39.99) Buy it at BOL A bedtime tale so snuggly it makes you want to rush off to bed immediately. Books which are the modern equivalent of the lullaby don't come more enchanting than this. Simplicity is the keynote, both in the everyday magic of the text and the drawings. Burningham manages to capture exactly what a fish looks like heavy-eyed with sleep, or how comfy the man in the moon is as he settles down for the night. This book takes the reader from sleepiness to sleep itself. My Dad Anthony Browne (Doubleday, \u00a39.99) Buy it at BOL Here's a chance to introduce the very youngest members of the family to Browne's sideways looks at the world. He always sees the extraordinary in the most ordinary lives; here a dad, who never succeeds in getting out of his dressing gown, manages to see off a wolf, dance the tango, replace one of the three tenors and do long division, all before breakfast. There is a great sense of humour at work, in bold visual jokes that keep children alert and stop parents dropping off during repeated readings. The Obvious Elephant Bruce Robinson and Sophie Windham (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99) Buy it at BOL \"Imagine a town, in a country, where a simple thing like an elephant had never been seen, or even heard of.\" That's the tantalising start to this completely enchanting and thought-provoking tale about an elephant that turns up one day. Nobody knows what to do with it. Should they plug it in, using it as a railway engine or vacuum cleaner? Only a little boy called Eric knows what the creature is, and nobody will listen to him. The Very Small Joyce Dunbar, illustrated by Debi Gliori (Doubleday, \u00a310.99) Buy it at BOL When Giant Baby Bear is out he finds a Very Small. It looks like a cross between one of Peter Pan's Lost Boys, Thumbelina and an elf. And in Debi Gliori's enchanting illustrations it is irresistible, even to Giant Baby Bear (pretty cute too) who makes Very Small a playground, a bath in a soapdish and dinner (one whole pea). They snuggle down, but it only takes a sneeze from Bear for Very Small to be blown back to his parents. The difference between big and small has never been delivered with such poetry. Age 4-7 Fairy Tales Berlie Doherty, illustrated by Jane Ray (Walker, \u00a314.99) Buy it at BOL Is it possible to make Cinderella sound fresh, or Beauty and the Beast seem new-minted? Berlie Doherty can. This wonderful book creates a jewel-like world of enchantment studded with Jane Ray's gold-encrusted, richly coloured drawings that pick up on the style and mood of each story. But it doesn't neglect the words. Doherty's prose is easy and stylish without being tricksy. Enchantment Kevin Crossley-Holland, illustrated by Emma Chichester Clark (Orion, \u00a312.99) Buy it at BOL Crossley-Holland retells old folk tales better then anyone else alive, and this selection of fairy tales, ghost stories and tales of wonder from throughout these isles is as good as anything he's done. It is nice to see children being taken seriously as an audience. The foolishness of humans is a recurrent theme where imps, ghosts and boggarts almost always have the last laugh. How the Whale Became and Other Stories Ted Hughes, illustrated by Jackie Morris (Faber and Faber, \u00a317.99) Buy it at BOL This book of Ted Hughes's inventive creation fables, first published in 1963, will give pleasure to your children all their lives. Hughes tells us how the tortoise always used to come first in any race, why the hare believes that the moon wants to marry him and why it took a while for the elephant to learn to be itself. Jackie Morris's illustrations display a rich, muted, almost medieval beauty. Beware of the Storybook Wolves Lauren Child (Hodder, \u00a39.99) Buy it at BOL Lauren Child is a writer/illustrator who makes words dance and topography jitterbug and whose sly sense of humour makes both children and adults giggle. This is for anyone who has ever believed there might be a wolf under their bed and who worried that characters in books, particularly the nasty ones, might creep out in the night and get you. Age 8-11 The Wind Singer William Nicholson (Mammoth, \u00a312.99) Buy it at BOL One of the best and most original books of the year, Nicholson's novel is set in a supposedly perfect society where everyone from the age of two is tested and given a personal rating that they must strive to improve. But Kestral rebels, and together with her twin brother and the smelly outcast Mumpo, sets off on a dangerous journey to find a way to liberate her homeland. This is a page-turning fantasy that clearly has its origins in our own world of Sats tests and league tables. A tough, cheering and inspiring story. A Handful of Magic Stephen Elboz (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Werewolves at the Tower of London, flying carpets, dragons, London's underground network of tunnels and an aunt who lives in a house on top of St Paul's cathedral are just some of the ingredients in a book that has flashes of inspiration as frequently as flashes of magic. Elboz writes with real panache. A book to wonder at, but one which also makes you think about the nature of science and progress. Charmed Life Diana Wynne Jones (Collins, \u00a34.99) Buy it at BOL Eric Chant, known as Cat, thinks he is just an ordinary boy and that his sister is the gifted witch of the family. But when they are orphaned and whisked off to live in a magician's castle and the magician takes away his troublesome sister's magic, Cat discovers unexpected power. Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series, of which this is the first, date from the 70s and are becoming hotter than Potter with a new generation of readers. Ella Enchanted Gail Carson Levine (Collins, \u00a33.99) Buy it at BOL Magic turns out to be a dangerous thing in this wonderfully witty book. When Ella is born, the fairy Lucinda grants her a gift: obedience. It turns out to be more of a curse, as the unscrupulous discover that they can make Ella do anything they command. Levine's witty, artful fairytale is unputdownable. Age 12+ Witch Child Celia Rees (Bloomsbury, \u00a310.99) Buy it at BOL The triumph of Rees's book, which takes the form of a 17th-century journal found sewn into the lining of a quilt 300 years later, is not just that it is a really good and cleverly constructed read. No, she also convincingly charts the psychology and political circumstances that engendered witch-hunts. Mary, a teenager whose adopted grandmother is executed as a witch in a small English village, thinks she is escaping to freedom when she sets sail with others for a fresh life in the New World. But survival is even more in doubt there. Rees writes with grace and urgency through to the convincingly ambiguous ending. Vicky Angel Jacqueline Wilson (Doubleday, \u00a310.99) Buy it at BOL Wilson's gift is an instantly accessible prose style that taps into the raw emotions of her young heroines and readers, combined with an ability to write issue-based books that aren't the slightest bit preachy. Her latest deals with death and friendship, as Jade is faced with life without her best friend Vicky, suddenly killed in a road accident. But as teachers, parents and friends worry about Jade having to do everything alone, her real problem is that Vicky is still making them do everything together. She is being haunted. Heaven Eyes David Almond (Hodder, \u00a310) Buy it at BOL Erin, January and Mouse run away from a children's home and set sail. They are rescued by Heaven Eyes, a girl with webbed hands and feet who believes they are her lost siblings. Almond's eerie tale is an astonishing piece of writing about the way that the living and the dead find comfort in each other and about daring to go as far as death and having the courage to come back again. A very grown-up, totally compelling book that, like Almond's brilliant Skellig, is about the lost and found, abandonment and redemption, love and faith - particularly faith in yourself and others. A Long Way From Chicago Richard Peck (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a33.99) Buy it at BOL It is 1929 and Joey and his sister travel from the Chicago of Bugsy Malone and Al Capone to the hicksville town of their gran on what is to be the first of a yearly summer visit. Here in her parlour they see their first dead body. Peck's brilliant book, a series of interlinked short stories that telescope in time to 1942, has the polecat reek of authentic American fiction. It is full of characters with names such as Shotgun Cheetham, a gran who behaves with the recklessness of a frontier-town outlaw, and a wonderful sense of the way we all turn our lives into myth. Seen entirely through the eyes of the child, this is a great book about the way you grow up slower than you want - and faster than you realise. \u0095 For a fuller list, see www.books-unlimited.co.uk/childrenslibrary",

Tim Pigott-Smith gives it a superb white-knuckle reading. </p> <p> <strong>Stalingrad </strong>&lt;BR Antony Beevor<br> (Isis, \u00a321.99, 17.5 hrs) <br> The morass of daily advance and retreat at this city that Hitler wanted to grab, and Stalin to hold at any cost, are tricky enough for the non-military enthusiast to retain from the printed page. Audio scores in uttering aloud the many snapshots of courage, degradation and incredible endurance which cram the book. Michael Tudor Barnes uses a dour delivery with a sepulchral sheen.</p> <p> <strong>An Accidental MP</strong><br> written and read by Martin Bell<br> (Penguin, \u00a38.99, 165 min abridged) <br> Bell's account of stumbling into the Commons as the first independent MP in nigh-on 50 years is truly riveting. The first to land a blow on Blair in the Ecclestone affair, Bell concludes that political sleaze has not been killed, just slithered out of reach of its opponents.</p> <p><strong>The Periodic Kingdom </strong><br> Peter Atkins<br> (Orion, \u00a39.99, 180 min) <br> Oxford's professor of chemistry poetically presents the chart as a series of landscapes. Risk having your dormant interest in chemistry rekindled.</p> <p> <strong>ABC of Relativity </strong><br> Bertrand Russell<br> (Orion, \u00a38.99, 180 min) <br> Risk the same with physics. If only we'd all had Derek Jacobi delivering Russell's sparkling introduction to Einstein first time around when the subject was murdered at school. He makes Russell's guide through the theories of special and general relativity for folk with no mathematical knowledge sound as fresh as it did in 1958.</p> <p><strong>The Lady in the Van</strong><br> written and read by Alan Bennett <br>(BBC Radio, \u00a38.99, 100 min) <br> Bennett loves eccentrics, and they're obviously drawn to him. For 15 years until her death, a dotty, elderly vagabond, Mary Shepherd, lived in a van in his front yard.

The opening up of Dutch society in the 1960s is paralleled by the rejection of outmoded footballing forms (defenders who just defend, attackers who merely attack) and a new commitment to \"total football\". This could have been tiresomely self-conscious, like so many Hornby writealikes, but thanks to Winner's lifelong fascination with his subject it isn't.

Jack Iverson played five Tests for Australia half a century ago; his first-class career lasted barely three years. Not, on the surface, obvious material for a 376-page biography. But Iverson's career trajectory was like no other cricketer's, and Gideon Haigh has written a superb book about him, <strong>Mystery Spinner: The Story of Jack Iverson</strong> (Aurum Press, \u00a318.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502408720,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). Iverson, who developed an unusual way of spinning the ball, didn't play top-flight cricket until he was 31. His rise thereafter was meteoric, but he never quite believed in himself and soon abandoned play. Haigh brilliantly reconstructs this almost forgotten figure without, as he admits, ever understanding why, at the age of 58, he killed himself.</p> <p>The best sporting stories are human dramas, and one of the greatest is told in Lance Armstrong's<strong> It's Not About The Bike</strong> (Yellow Jersey Press, \u00a317 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000303420,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>). In 1996, at the age of 25, American cyclist Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer. He fought it, beat it and, three years later, won the Tour de France. This is a gripping story: from fatherless childhood, through devastating diagnosis and treatment, to triumph in the toughest endurance test in the world. His single-mindedness and his strength of character shine through on every page, and the reader is left with the impression that after winning the battle against cancer riding over the Alps was a doddle.</p> <p> All sport is about remembered greatness, and there is nothing more affecting than the physical decline of Muhammad Ali, the best boxer and one of the most vivid personalities of all time. Flip Schulke and Matt Schudel's <strong>Muhammad Ali: The Birth of a Legend, Miami 1961-1964 </strong>(Souvenir Press, \u00a318.99 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000094590,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) captures him in his youthful prime, training in Miami in the years between his Olympic gold medal and his assault on Sonny Liston's world title. Schulke's photographs of the exuberant Cassius Clay - he changed his name to Muhammad Ali when he embraced Islam in 1964 - are remarkable, and well supported by Schudel's brisk text.</p> <p> Too few \"proper\" historians write about sport, but David Underdown, a specialist in early modern England and a cricket nut, is an exception. <strong>Start of Play: Cricket and Culture in Eighteenth-Century England</strong> (Penguin, \u00a320 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501840354,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>) is a readable, insightful, meticulously sourced history that demonstrates the strength and popularity of the professional game a century before the age of Grace.

Roy Porter's headlong, heady new book provides thrilling insights into the century of Paine and Pope, of Newton, Locke and Hume, while offering some thought-provoking modern parallels - the daily post with email, Restoration theatre with television, Christian economists with Thatcherism, and so on.</p> <p><strong>Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s</strong><br> by Piers Brendon<br> Cape, \u00a325<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502369820,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Brendon's authoritative and provocative book provides a timely reminder that we're wrong to think of globalisation as a purely modern phenomenon. He presents the 30s as a decade in which each apparently independent part of the world depended on the others. Wall Street crashed and took Tokyo with it.</p> <p><strong>No Logo</strong><br> by Naomi Klein<br> Flamingo, \u00a314.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501009045,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Klein's rallying cry against global capitalism is so immediate and timely that it seems almost perverse to classify it as history: but this book will go down as a monument to the dawn of political consciousness in Generation X. </p> <p><strong>Dr Seuss Goes to War: the World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel </strong><br>edited by Richard H Minear<br> Verso, \u00a317 (January 2001)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000304993,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Dr Seuss has been such an integral part of childhood for the last two generations that it's almost shocking to find him putting his graphic wit and high-hatted cats to the sly service of the US propaganda machine. The Cat in the Hat may have come back, but fortunately the fasc in the 'tache did not.</p> <p><strong>Memoirs and letters</strong></p> <p><strong>Bad Blood</strong> <br> by Lorna Sage<br> Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502449521,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Lorna Sage's Whitbread-nominated memoir is one of the surprise successes of the autumn: an almost unbearably eloquent account of the unlikely childhood and adolescence that shaped this distinguished academic. Few others have destroyed so successfully the fantasy of the family as a safe place to be or described so well the way in which rage, grief and frustrated desire are passed down the family line like a curse.</p> <p><strong>Experience</strong><br> by Martin Amis<br> Cape, \u00a318<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501022002,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> We've all heard the stories about Famous Amis, but here's what they look like from the inside. In what is arguably his best book, he grapples with recent public traumas: the death of his father, Kingsley; the discovery that his cousin, Lucy Partington, who disappeared in 1973, was a victim of Fred West; the realisation that he had a teenage daughter from a distant relationship. But he does so with delicacy and - strangely for such a work of disclosure - a fine sense of private dignity. </p> <p><strong>Selected Letters of Rebecca West</strong><br> edited by Bonnie Kime Scott<br> Yale University Press, \u00a325<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364396,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Rebecca West is a sadly neglected figure whose masterwork, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, was one of the great books of the last century. Her letters are irresistible - a mixture of wicked character assassination (of everyone from Virginia Woolf to Jean Rhys to Henry Miller) and shrewd social commentary, as well as a troubling portrait of a brilliant woman whose powers turned so against her that even her only son finally denounced her.</p> <p><strong>Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde </strong><br> edited by Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis<br> Fourth Estate, \u00a335<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000304614,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> It would be hard to have missed the fact that this is Oscar's centenary year. Of all the books and revivals and exhibitions, this is the piece de resistance: meticulously edited by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland, it is the most comprehensive collection yet of Wilde's correspondence, and charts his development from ambitious young man about town to literary dandy and tortured outcast.</p> <p><strong>Science</strong></p> <p><strong> Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the 20th Century</strong><br> by John McNeill<br> Allen Lane, \u00a320 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502441039,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> McNeill produces some mind-boggling statistics to support his thesis that we may have pushed the earth to the brink of global extinction. For instance, in the last century, humanity moved more rock and soil around the globe than did wind, glaciers, mountain-building processes or volcanoes; so numerous and powerful have we become that we now collectively qualify as a geological process. This may sound frightening, but McNeill is no scaremonger: he provides us with the evidence to make up our own minds.</p> <p><strong>Trilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution</strong><br> by Richard Fortey<br> HarperCollins, \u00a315.99 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501005974,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br>Trilobites, mysterious little fossilised animals which played a key part in the discovery of time, are Richard Fortey's obsession. The Natural History Museum expert has used their story to tell a number of other narratives: of the revelations of evolution, of how science is done and of the strange people who do it. If there is any justice, Trilobite! will do for palaeontology what Longitude did for navigation.</p> <p><strong>Seeing And Believing: The Story of the Telescope, or How We Found our Place in the Universe </strong><br> by Richard Panek<br> Fourth Estate, \u00a312 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364876,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> Panek's eye-popping book - brief enough to be gobbled at one sitting, rich enough to re-open immediately - is a story of ever-expanding horizons starting with Galileo's perspicillum. Astronomers now penetrate the past by looking across distances so vast that, astronomical having become an abused adjective, there are no words that fit.

In fact, as Rees shows, physics and cosmology are now joined in an arc of knowledge in which theories of the most fundamental particles feed into accounts of the development of the whole universe.

He went where few travel writers venture - places like Woking, Macclesfield, Huntingdon and Romford - and spent his time in town-centre pubs and cheap Chinese restaurants, the 60s housing estates and 80s shopping malls that are home to most of the English most of the time.

Elliot is made of sterner stuff, and has several awards to prove it. He was 19 when he first got a taste for dodging bullets with somebody else's name on them. The bullets then were Russian, and the name they bore was Mujaheddin. A decade on, and Elliot is back - this time in Taliban territory.

And then he takes you for a long drive out of Lake Tahoe and past the last town with its one-pump gas station, onward and out into the Black Rock Desert - for desert and desertedness, he declares, are the true character of Nevada.

Blasket: the very name smells of cold, wet stone. It's half a century since the islanders, grown weary of their hard, medieval lives, begged the authorities to ship them out for good, but the story has lost none of its resonance. And where did they vanish to, those survivors of an ancient race? Moreton found many of them living now in the most modern country in the world.</p> <p><strong>Abdul's Taxi To Kalighat </strong> <br>by Joe Roberts<br> Profile Books, \u00a315.99 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502353383,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> To Joe, Emma and baby Llewelyn, just arrived from Bath, the Fairlawn hotel in Calcutta seems like a bit of an England that never was, or Fawlty Towers transported to the poorest city on earth. Except that, for all its poverty, Calcutta has a lot more going for it than all those documentaries about Mother Teresa had us believe. It is a living kaleidoscope, says Roberts, and a city buzzing with conversations. It is those conversations, acutely observed, that run through this book like veins of liqueur in some exotic ice cream.</p> <p><strong>Showbiz</strong></p> <p><strong>Still Memories: An Autobiography in Photography </strong><br> by John Mills<br> Hutchinson, \u00a320<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502379260,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> As well as being one of the last survivors of a titanic generation of actors, John Mills is a dab hand with a camera.

Nichols (creator of A Day in the Death of Joe Egg and Passion, among other plays) is one of the tribe who have gallingly seen early success slip away, while watching it stick like a limpet to their contemporaries. Nichols is duly galled. Scratchy and self-lacerating, this book places him up there with Simon Gray as one of the great theatre diarists.</p> <p><strong>The Sopranos: A Family History </strong><br> Channel 4 Books, \u00a315.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000092746,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> This purports to be the research notes of a mafia expert, author of such plausible works as Kinship Patterns in Mafia Life.

      "bodyText": "History Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World by Roy Porter Viking, \u00a325 Buy it at BOL What does it mean to say that people in periwigs created the modern world more than 200 years ago, before electricity, before emancipation, before revolution? Roy Porter's headlong, heady new book provides thrilling insights into the century of Paine and Pope, of Newton, Locke and Hume, while offering some thought-provoking modern parallels - the daily post with email, Restoration theatre with television, Christian economists with Thatcherism, and so on. Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s by Piers Brendon Cape, \u00a325 Buy it at BOL Brendon's authoritative and provocative book provides a timely reminder that we're wrong to think of globalisation as a purely modern phenomenon. He presents the 30s as a decade in which each apparently independent part of the world depended on the others. Wall Street crashed and took Tokyo with it. No Logo by Naomi Klein Flamingo, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL Klein's rallying cry against global capitalism is so immediate and timely that it seems almost perverse to classify it as history: but this book will go down as a monument to the dawn of political consciousness in Generation X. Dr Seuss Goes to War: the World War II Editorial Cartoons of Theodor Seuss Geisel edited by Richard H Minear Verso, \u00a317 (January 2001) Buy it at BOL Dr Seuss has been such an integral part of childhood for the last two generations that it's almost shocking to find him putting his graphic wit and high-hatted cats to the sly service of the US propaganda machine. The Cat in the Hat may have come back, but fortunately the fasc in the 'tache did not. Memoirs and letters Bad Blood by Lorna Sage Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL Lorna Sage's Whitbread-nominated memoir is one of the surprise successes of the autumn: an almost unbearably eloquent account of the unlikely childhood and adolescence that shaped this distinguished academic. Few others have destroyed so successfully the fantasy of the family as a safe place to be or described so well the way in which rage, grief and frustrated desire are passed down the family line like a curse. Experience by Martin Amis Cape, \u00a318 Buy it at BOL We've all heard the stories about Famous Amis, but here's what they look like from the inside. In what is arguably his best book, he grapples with recent public traumas: the death of his father, Kingsley; the discovery that his cousin, Lucy Partington, who disappeared in 1973, was a victim of Fred West; the realisation that he had a teenage daughter from a distant relationship. But he does so with delicacy and - strangely for such a work of disclosure - a fine sense of private dignity. Selected Letters of Rebecca West edited by Bonnie Kime Scott Yale University Press, \u00a325 Buy it at BOL Rebecca West is a sadly neglected figure whose masterwork, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, was one of the great books of the last century. Her letters are irresistible - a mixture of wicked character assassination (of everyone from Virginia Woolf to Jean Rhys to Henry Miller) and shrewd social commentary, as well as a troubling portrait of a brilliant woman whose powers turned so against her that even her only son finally denounced her. Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde edited by Merlin Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis Fourth Estate, \u00a335 Buy it at BOL It would be hard to have missed the fact that this is Oscar's centenary year. Of all the books and revivals and exhibitions, this is the piece de resistance: meticulously edited by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland, it is the most comprehensive collection yet of Wilde's correspondence, and charts his development from ambitious young man about town to literary dandy and tortured outcast. Science Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the 20th Century by John McNeill Allen Lane, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL McNeill produces some mind-boggling statistics to support his thesis that we may have pushed the earth to the brink of global extinction. For instance, in the last century, humanity moved more rock and soil around the globe than did wind, glaciers, mountain-building processes or volcanoes; so numerous and powerful have we become that we now collectively qualify as a geological process. This may sound frightening, but McNeill is no scaremonger: he provides us with the evidence to make up our own minds. Trilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution by Richard Fortey HarperCollins, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL Trilobites, mysterious little fossilised animals which played a key part in the discovery of time, are Richard Fortey's obsession. The Natural History Museum expert has used their story to tell a number of other narratives: of the revelations of evolution, of how science is done and of the strange people who do it. If there is any justice, Trilobite! will do for palaeontology what Longitude did for navigation. Seeing And Believing: The Story of the Telescope, or How We Found our Place in the Universe by Richard Panek Fourth Estate, \u00a312 Buy it at BOL Panek's eye-popping book - brief enough to be gobbled at one sitting, rich enough to re-open immediately - is a story of ever-expanding horizons starting with Galileo's perspicillum. Astronomers now penetrate the past by looking across distances so vast that, astronomical having become an abused adjective, there are no words that fit. Panek takes us on a trip from a garden in Padua almost to the edge of time itself - most of it down a little tube with glass at each end. Just Six Numbers by Martin Rees Phoenix, \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL This short and admirably lucid introduction to modern cosmology dispenses once and for all with the hope that physics, with all its breathtaking complexities, would somehow go away. In fact, as Rees shows, physics and cosmology are now joined in an arc of knowledge in which theories of the most fundamental particles feed into accounts of the development of the whole universe. At the bottom of it all lies a series of numbers. Poetry Marfan by Peter Reading Bloodaxe, \u00a36.95 Buy it at BOL This collection marks a welcome return by this remarkable writer to a poetry of anecdote and reportage, great jokes and dark visions. The poems simmer with humanist political rage and epicurean nihilism, satirising small-town Texas while also strangely celebrating it. Live from the Hong Kong Nile Club by August Kleinzahler Faber, \u00a38.99 Buy it at BOL This recently published collection is a selection of early poems by a formidably gifted American lyric poet who was recently (and intelligently) compared to Tom Waits. Selected Poems by Denise Riley Reality Street Editions, \u00a37.50 Buy it at BOL Work by one of the most interesting and admired \"avant-garde\" poets (for want of a better term), whose critical work as well as her poetry has inspired many other writers. Wide-ranging, sometimes anguished, her poems are fascinating and often beautiful, and certainly more than usually thought-provoking. Boss Cupid by Thom Gunn Faber, \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL Gunn's generous poetry, passionate and tactful in equal measure, moves between elegy and celebration with enviable fluency and breadth of technique. Selected Poems by Veronica Forrest-Thomson Invisible Books, \u00a310.95 One for the adventurous: a collection by the late Veronica Forrest-Thomson, whose writing dances on top of Wittgenstein's ideas before flying upwards and onwards. It is intellectually demanding but also charming, camp, vivacious, chirpy and self-doubting, and the volume comes with an essay placing her in a sometimes forgotten tradition of British writing. Travel Mexico City - A Cultural And Literary Companion by Nick Caistor SignalBooks, \u00a312 Buy it at BOL In February 1978, electricians burying cables at the back of the cathedral in the central plaza stumbled on the remains of El Templo Mayor, the vast pyramid that the Aztecs had built in the middle of Lake Texcoco to represent the centre of their world.

Home Truths by Bill Murphy Mainstream, \u00a37.99 Buy it at BOL Having spent eight months touring ordinary English towns and cities, Murphy concludes that, with the possible exception of Norwich, the country and all who sail in her has gone to the dogs. He went where few travel writers venture - places like Woking, Macclesfield, Huntingdon and Romford - and spent his time in town-centre pubs and cheap Chinese restaurants, the 60s housing estates and 80s shopping malls that are home to most of the English most of the time. Hilarious and depressing by turns. An Unexpected Light: Travels In Afghanistan by Jason Elliot Picador, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL Elliot has little time for the travel writer who \"preys shamelessly for as long as the family trust fund will allow on the hospitality of the native people, and returns home to hastily record his or her first impressions in a semi-fictional collection of descriptions that affirm the prejudices of the day\". Elliot is made of sterner stuff, and has several awards to prove it. He was 19 when he first got a taste for dodging bullets with somebody else's name on them. The bullets then were Russian, and the name they bore was Mujaheddin. A decade on, and Elliot is back - this time in Taliban territory. And not a trust fund in sight. In Nevada by David Thomson Little Brown, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL Pronounce Nevada, instructs Thomson, with a short second syllable, so it echoes not \"larder\" but \"sadder\". And then he takes you for a long drive out of Lake Tahoe and past the last town with its one-pump gas station, onward and out into the Black Rock Desert - for desert and desertedness, he declares, are the true character of Nevada. And Vegas? \"Have no fear,\" he says. \"We do get to Las Vegas eventually.\" Hungry For Home by Cole Moreton Viking, \u00a314.99 Buy it at BOL Stand on the edge of Kerry - the most westerly point of the European mainland - and on a clear day you will see the Blasket Islands.

Abdul's Taxi To Kalighat by Joe Roberts Profile Books, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL To Joe, Emma and baby Llewelyn, just arrived from Bath, the Fairlawn hotel in Calcutta seems like a bit of an England that never was, or Fawlty Towers transported to the poorest city on earth. Except that, for all its poverty, Calcutta has a lot more going for it than all those documentaries about Mother Teresa had us believe. It is a living kaleidoscope, says Roberts, and a city buzzing with conversations. It is those conversations, acutely observed, that run through this book like veins of liqueur in some exotic ice cream. Showbiz Still Memories: An Autobiography in Photography by John Mills Hutchinson, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL As well as being one of the last survivors of a titanic generation of actors, John Mills is a dab hand with a camera. His photographic odyssey through his own life provides a priceless glimpse of the fun behind the fame, featuring such well-known mischief makers as Laurence Olivier, Peter Sellers and, well, just about everyone actually. Collected Screenplays 1-3 by Harold Pinter Faber, \u00a320 Buy it at BOL Harold Pinter's 70th birthday year has prompted a scattering of theatrical celebrations. Here is a decisive reminder that he is also one of the great British screenwriters, with credits ranging from The Go-Between and The French Lieutenant's Woman to The Comfort of Strangers. Diaries 1969-1977 by Peter Nichols Nick Hern Books, \u00a325 Buy it at BOL In an arena not chiefly known for its self-scrutiny, here is a provocative, truthful and scarringly witty account of the life of a playwright.

The Sopranos: A Family History Channel 4 Books, \u00a315.99 Buy it at BOL This purports to be the research notes of a mafia expert, author of such plausible works as Kinship Patterns in Mafia Life. It is so packed with wicked inventions, such as the family cashflow receipts from talent management at the Bada Bing strip joint, that it is clear real author Allen Rucker had a ball compiling it. A Box of Alan Bennett: The Clothes They Stood Up In; The Lady in the Van, Father! Father! Burning Bright Profile, \u00a39.99 Buy it at BOL Alan Bennett has made his life into a performance, in much the same way as Quentin Crisp - though to gentler, more wry effect.

Sci-fi Perdido Street Station by China Mi\u008eville Macmillan, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL This is no run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. Having accidentally released a flock of rapacious killer butterflies, our hero has to hunt them down with the help of a dimension-jumping spider obsessed with adding new examples to its scissor collection.

Pakistan, is it not, is a land of dust and heat, of flat and emasculating pitches, high scores ground out - Naved Latif's 394 for Sarghoda, a 13-hour epic compiled only last week, being merely the latest - and interminable draws? Unless they have mastered the mysteries of reverse swing, fast bowlers have tended not to come here by choice and they generally depart sore of foot with a throbbing bowling average. But this young fellow thinks he is in paradise. Wherever he turns up to play, the grass grows miraculously and the air fills with moisture. They should send him to end the Afghan drought.

There is the studio Fall, still making punchy, complex and inventive albums like last year's The Marshall Suite and their latest, The Unutterable. And there's the live Fall, which doesn't quite measure up, either to the band's brilliance on record or to the virtuosity of previous live line-ups. </p> <p>The spirit isn't lacking: cocky young recruits Adam Helal and Neville Wilding do their stuff with aplomb, pushing the thumping bass and vindictive surf guitar respectively. But the sound rarely transcends standard garage-band dynamics; it's only when Nagle switches from guitar to keyboards that more interesting textures creep in. </p> <p>Smith himself looks more battle-scarred and lemon-faced than ever. He grudgingly sidles on to the stage in his leather jacket looking like a sullen copper facing another day interrogating shoplifters. As a singer, Smith has almost entirely dispensed with consonants, and mostly sounds like a half-hearted W C Fields impersonator trying to dislodge a fishbone from his throat. Perhaps he's just had enough of the stage routine - you can only imagine what it must be like playing Fall gigs for 23 years of your life. He only really seemed to enjoy himself on the spirited rock 'n' roll revamp Foldin' Money. </p> <p>A rather desultory set did the business on the more straightforward numbers - Touch Sensitive, The Joke, Wilding's sub-Stranglers number Hands Up Billy. The final encore was an unexpected revival of the 1985-vintage Paintwork - a spirited crowd-pleaser but a reminder that too much of the time, this line-up resembles a competent Fall tribute band (except that they don't play that many old Fall covers). </p> <p>And yet there were a couple of moments I wouldn't have missed. One was a version of Dr Buck's Letter from the new record - its electronic creak entirely transformed into a moody semi-funk groove, as close as the Fall get to the Meters. And there was a delicate synthesiser interlude, over which MES intoned dryly and more or less intelligibly. One phrase rang clear as crystal: \"What a pain in the arse this bloody group is\" Who says he doesn't speak for his frustrated following? </p> <p> \u0095 The Fall tour continues at the Lomax, Liverpool (0151-707 9977), tonight and the Liquid Room, Edinburgh (0131-225 2564), tomorrow.</p>",

The expected increases could begin to undo the steep reductions in bills brought about by price controls and competition among suppliers which, according to Callum McCarthy, the energy regulator, amount to \u00a32.3bn a year. Anna Walker, the director general for energy at the DTI, told an Institute of Economic Affairs conference in London that the UK faced a 100% rise in wholesale gas prices, primarily because of links to Europe. Britain imports gas via the interconnector to Europe, where prices are index-linked to those for oil, and EU directives to open up energy markets are being flouted - especially in France. Jeremy Nicholson, a policy adviser to the energy intensive users' group, said gas prices had doubled in the past year and had already cost heavy industry \u00a3500m in extra costs. \"There is likely to be an impact on domestic bills next year,\" he said. Experts said the initial impact would be felt on gas bills and would then fall on electricity bills, with one forecasting that consumers may have to pay up to a quarter more - particularly after Ofgem, the regulator, lifts price controls on gas in April. Ann Robinson, the chairman of Energywatch, the new consumer watchdog, said the rises would begin to hit consumers from January or February. \"I suspect any increase in gas prices will work in favour of the dominant supplier, British Gas, which will be in a strong position because of its huge customer base and low infrastructure costs to absorb them more easily than smaller competitors,\" she said.

What about Bounty Trail, which features the further adventures of Star Wars intergalactic bounty hunter Boba Fett? Or how about that episode of The X-Files in which Mulder and Scully investigate the death of Elvis Presley? If Star Trek: Voyager isn't doing it for you, then take a look at the other Trek series, Hidden Frontier.</p> <p>If the above sound like fanciful ideas dreamed up by fans, that's because they are. And the odd thing is, they also actually exist for you to watch and enjoy.</p> <p>These are products of the 'fan film' scene - an offshoot culture of independent digital film-making. Fan films feature the characters, settings or premise of popular genre properties in stories that audiences will probably never get to see on the movie screen or television. Most fan film-makers go through the same hard work involved in making a typical independent short film - scriptwriting, casting, on-set production and post-production. The difference is that they work with a property that belongs to somebody else, in most cases without the consent of the original creator or copyright holder.</p> <p>\"I think with many of these properties the creators have crafted such fully realised universes that someone can come in and create their own story alongside the 'big boys,'\" says Justin Young, a 21-year-old college student and fan film-maker who has produced his own films based on the \"Highlander\" movie and TV series.</p> <p>But creating your own sequel or prequel to these \"fully realized universes\" has only recently become feasible for the average fan. Once upon a time, fans had to be content with penning a fan-fiction story (or writing the script for a \"virtual season\" for a TV show, for instance); these days, they can create and distribute actual films that, in their special effects at least, are not so far behind what's being releasing in cinemas. </p> <p>Armed with inexpensive digital camcorders and broadband Net connections, fans now have the means to create and distribute their own audiovisual productions.</p> <p>For a small group of devotees, fandom is becoming a matter of participation rather than just spectacle. In the process, fan film-makers may be helping to change the way we experience the movies.</p> <p>Fan film-makers generally give credit for the current interest in fan films to Troops, the well-received parody film that crossed Star Wars with reality TV show Cops. Produced two years ago, Troops was distributed as large video files downloaded from web sites, the same way most fan films are released today. </p> <p>What's striking about Troops is the effects. Here's a film, produced on a home PC, that does a not-half-bad job of mimicking the kinds of million-dollar bells and whistles George Lucas brought to the screen in Star Wars. </p> <p>The technological success of Troops inspired fans to broaden their approach: Why make only parodies when you can do 'serious' short films set in the Star Wars universe?</p> <p>Several Star Wars fan films are available online or in production. \"For some reason we thought we were the only doofuses with this idea, that we'd be alone in kick-starting this new minigenre,\" says Devon Read, a 20-year-old graphic designer who's finishing up production on his Star Wars fan film. </p> <p>While Star Wars remains the most popular subject by far, the world of fan films has grown to include unofficial films based on other properties like Star Trek, The X-Files, Highlander, Batman, Spiderman, The X-Men and more.</p> <p>One obvious question from all of this: Why bother making a film based on somebody else's property, rather than something of your own creation?</p> <p>\"Hey, it's Star Wars!\" explains Jeff Vitkuske, a high school student from Ontario, Canada, who is busy producing fan films based on Star Wars and The X-Men. </p> <p>\"It's great to make up something yourself,\" he says, \"but let me tell you - there's nothing like watching yourself wielding a light saber!\"</p> <p>In fact, there's nothing new about fans co-opting their favourite media sensations. According to Henry Jenkins, director of comparative media studies at MIT, humans have always reinterpreted the stories they hear. \"Throughout most of human history, people operated according to a folk culture model - that is, they saw themselves as entitled to add to or retell the core myths and stories of their culture.\"</p> <p>Jenkins points out that more than 200 appropriations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland were published in the 20 years after the novel first appeared and many of them circulated commercially. If anything, what's recent is the inflexibility of media corporations in responding to fans' creations. </p> <p>\"Contemporary mass culture assumes that the average citizen consumes but does not participate,\" says Jenkins, \"whereas fandom holds onto the ideal of a culture where everyone is free and able to participate.\"</p> <p>Not that many fan film-makers would turn down an offer to join the big studios. Both Troops and Bounty Trail helped their creators move on to work in the film industry. Bounty Trail caught the attention of Lucas, who subsequently hired the fan-film director to work on the production of the second Star Wars prequel.</p> <p>While technology enables fan film-makers to achieve near Hollywood effects, it has not delivered the key to good film-making. The acting and screenwriting in most fan films are not exactly of Oscar-winning quality, and other production values tend to betray the films' amateur origins. In the Star Trek knockoff Hidden Frontier, you can't help speculating on the little things - like if those among the cast who actually look good in their Starfleet uniforms are the aspiring actors, while those who do not are the regulars at Trek conventions.</p> <p>\"My opinion on fan films (and I've only really seen the Star Wars ones) is that on the whole they're mediocre,\" says Scott Middlebrook, who has reviewed more than 60 fan-made films for Force Flicks, a Star Wars multimedia fan site.</p> <p>\"A lot of the more popular films are fairly average - nothing more than light saber duels with little or no story. Parodies seem to come up better than the serious films. I guess if the film's not taking itself too seriously, it's easier for the audience to do the same. Plus, 'Star Wars' fans can get a tad anal and nit-picking (myself included) about the more serious stuff.\"</p> <p>But, again, the effects aren't half-bad. That's partly due to the immense amount of sharing on the internet among fan film-makers when it comes to special effects and other production techniques. Many designers who have made their own 3-D models of Star Wars vehicles and droids are willing to share their work for credit on a fan film.</p> <p>A plethora of tutorials - essentially constituting a Star Wars Film-making for Dummies - show film-makers everything from how to create light saber and laser blast effects to making authentic-looking costumes and props. Says Justin Young: \"We will always be a step or two behind ILM [Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic], but I think how close we have come would shock most people.\"</p> <p>As for the legal issues, fan films appear to fall within a gray area between fan fiction and parody, both of which are legally protected under US law. Within the fan-film scene, de facto rules keep most fan film-makers from selling their work.</p> <p>Still, at least one fan film has landed its producer in trouble with the law. Marc Kimball, a 40-year-old animator for a video production company, took an old 8mm movie that he had shot in 1980 of himself starring as Superman, updated the film's effects with modern computer graphics and distributed the revised film for free on the internet.</p> <p>Lawyers representing DC Comics, the company that owns Superman, sent Kimball a cease-and-desist letter a week later. It stated that Kimball's work was unauthorised and accused Kimball of using a DC Comics property without the express written permission of DC Comics. Kimball promptly took down the site he had set up for distributing his film, without contesting the company's claims.</p> <p>\"I thought I had done everything right. The movie had original music and legal music-library stuff, an original story, original special effects,\" says Kimball. Furthermore, there were no ad banners on his web site, and he did not sell or make videotape copies of his film. He insists, \"I treated Superman with respect. The only thing was I used the Superman logo, name and costume, and they shut me down.\" (When asked for its official stance on fan films based on its properties and for comment on the Kimball matter, DC Comics' publicity manager responded to Salon: \"DC Comics has a long history of energetically protecting its copyrights and trademarks. Therefore, we stand by our cease-and-desist letter in this particular case.\")</p> <p>While DC Comics takes the hard line, other media giants may be opting for a more enlightened approach - drawing their fans into the fold. Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, has an informal agreement with Star Wars fans: \"We love our fans, and we love it when they express their creativity and enthusiasm for Star Wars,\" emphasises Lynne Hale, Lucas' publicist. \"When it does cross the line, or when we do have a problem, is when they use Star Wars copyrighted materials for commercial use.\" Otherwise, Star Wars fan film-makers have the blessing of Lucas himself.</p> <p>On November 6, the official web site for the Star Wars movies and AtomFilms announced that they will partner to launch the Star Wars Fan Film Network later this year, which will feature fan-made movies. Lucasfilm is going so far as to make sound effects - from Darth Vader's breathing to the equally recognisable light saber hum - available from its library for fan film-makers to use. The Star Wars Fan Film Network even plans to pay fan film-makers through royalties generated from advertising and sponsorship related to the site.</p> <p>\"Soon, [copyright holders] are going to need those active fans more than ever before,\" says MIT's Jenkins. \"In a world with multiple media options, video on demand and micropayments, fans may become the new gatekeepers who help direct consumers toward interesting and engaging media content. The smart media executive should figure out which direction the media-consuming public is moving, run around in front and shout, 'Follow me.'\"</p> <p>What motivates most fan film-makers is the desire to see other stories based on their favourite movie, TV series or superhero. Young says fan films can also help to supply a missing piece of the story that, without their creative efforts, might never have been pursued by the original creators. </p> <p>Young points out that there are no new episodes or shows based on Highlander, the inspiration for his own creation. And after the critical and box-office drubbing of the last movie, Highlander: Endgame, the future of this franchise's film series is in doubt. </p> <p>Similarly, Lucas has stated that he will not make a sequel trilogy to his Star Wars saga. \"I see the Star Wars fan-film community only growing more once [Episode III is released],\" says Young. He feels that fan film-making has grown to such a point that \"if the creators won't give you more, now you can simply create more yourself.\"</p> <p>Considering the extent to which digital film-making and broadband internet technology have already advanced and converged, some of the more extreme possibilities of the fan-film scene may not sound so far-fetched: will there come a time when fans \"take over\" TV shows, movies or other media properties? Will fan film-makers create the next Star Wars trilogy in Lucas' place?</p> <p>\"In a few years, there could be 50 [fan-made] Star Trek series online,\" says Young. \"That is very exciting. It also forces the professionals to work harder and really pay attention to what fans want. Hey, we're making what we want to see. If that's not what they're producing, then they should catch a hint.\"</p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p>\u0095 For Troops, go to <a href=\"http://www.theforce.net/troops\">theforce.net/troops</a>; for Dark Redemption go to <a href=\"http://www.theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/darkredemption/index.shtml\">theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/darkredemption/index.shtml</a>; for The X Files parody go to <a href=\"http://www.fountainheadpictures.com/FHPSite/X-Files_Graceland/graceland.html\">www.fountainheadpictures.com</a> </p> <p> The Star Wars Fan Film Network will launch later this year, at <a href=\"http://www.starwars.atomfilms.com\">www.starwars.atomfilms.com</a></p>",

But creating your own sequel or prequel to these \"fully realized universes\" has only recently become feasible for the average fan. Once upon a time, fans had to be content with penning a fan-fiction story (or writing the script for a \"virtual season\" for a TV show, for instance); these days, they can create and distribute actual films that, in their special effects at least, are not so far behind what's being releasing in cinemas. Armed with inexpensive digital camcorders and broadband Net connections, fans now have the means to create and distribute their own audiovisual productions. For a small group of devotees, fandom is becoming a matter of participation rather than just spectacle. In the process, fan film-makers may be helping to change the way we experience the movies. Fan film-makers generally give credit for the current interest in fan films to Troops, the well-received parody film that crossed Star Wars with reality TV show Cops. Produced two years ago, Troops was distributed as large video files downloaded from web sites, the same way most fan films are released today. What's striking about Troops is the effects. Here's a film, produced on a home PC, that does a not-half-bad job of mimicking the kinds of million-dollar bells and whistles George Lucas brought to the screen in Star Wars. The technological success of Troops inspired fans to broaden their approach: Why make only parodies when you can do 'serious' short films set in the Star Wars universe? Several Star Wars fan films are available online or in production. \"For some reason we thought we were the only doofuses with this idea, that we'd be alone in kick-starting this new minigenre,\" says Devon Read, a 20-year-old graphic designer who's finishing up production on his Star Wars fan film. While Star Wars remains the most popular subject by far, the world of fan films has grown to include unofficial films based on other properties like Star Trek, The X-Files, Highlander, Batman, Spiderman, The X-Men and more. One obvious question from all of this: Why bother making a film based on somebody else's property, rather than something of your own creation? \"Hey, it's Star Wars!\" explains Jeff Vitkuske, a high school student from Ontario, Canada, who is busy producing fan films based on Star Wars and The X-Men. \"It's great to make up something yourself,\" he says, \"but let me tell you - there's nothing like watching yourself wielding a light saber!\" In fact, there's nothing new about fans co-opting their favourite media sensations. According to Henry Jenkins, director of comparative media studies at MIT, humans have always reinterpreted the stories they hear. \"Throughout most of human history, people operated according to a folk culture model - that is, they saw themselves as entitled to add to or retell the core myths and stories of their culture.\" Jenkins points out that more than 200 appropriations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland were published in the 20 years after the novel first appeared and many of them circulated commercially. If anything, what's recent is the inflexibility of media corporations in responding to fans' creations. \"Contemporary mass culture assumes that the average citizen consumes but does not participate,\" says Jenkins, \"whereas fandom holds onto the ideal of a culture where everyone is free and able to participate.\" Not that many fan film-makers would turn down an offer to join the big studios. Both Troops and Bounty Trail helped their creators move on to work in the film industry. Bounty Trail caught the attention of Lucas, who subsequently hired the fan-film director to work on the production of the second Star Wars prequel. While technology enables fan film-makers to achieve near Hollywood effects, it has not delivered the key to good film-making. The acting and screenwriting in most fan films are not exactly of Oscar-winning quality, and other production values tend to betray the films' amateur origins. In the Star Trek knockoff Hidden Frontier, you can't help speculating on the little things - like if those among the cast who actually look good in their Starfleet uniforms are the aspiring actors, while those who do not are the regulars at Trek conventions. \"My opinion on fan films (and I've only really seen the Star Wars ones) is that on the whole they're mediocre,\" says Scott Middlebrook, who has reviewed more than 60 fan-made films for Force Flicks, a Star Wars multimedia fan site. \"A lot of the more popular films are fairly average - nothing more than light saber duels with little or no story. Parodies seem to come up better than the serious films. I guess if the film's not taking itself too seriously, it's easier for the audience to do the same. Plus, 'Star Wars' fans can get a tad anal and nit-picking (myself included) about the more serious stuff.\" But, again, the effects aren't half-bad. That's partly due to the immense amount of sharing on the internet among fan film-makers when it comes to special effects and other production techniques. Many designers who have made their own 3-D models of Star Wars vehicles and droids are willing to share their work for credit on a fan film. A plethora of tutorials - essentially constituting a Star Wars Film-making for Dummies - show film-makers everything from how to create light saber and laser blast effects to making authentic-looking costumes and props. Says Justin Young: \"We will always be a step or two behind ILM [Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic], but I think how close we have come would shock most people.\" As for the legal issues, fan films appear to fall within a gray area between fan fiction and parody, both of which are legally protected under US law. Within the fan-film scene, de facto rules keep most fan film-makers from selling their work. Still, at least one fan film has landed its producer in trouble with the law. Marc Kimball, a 40-year-old animator for a video production company, took an old 8mm movie that he had shot in 1980 of himself starring as Superman, updated the film's effects with modern computer graphics and distributed the revised film for free on the internet. Lawyers representing DC Comics, the company that owns Superman, sent Kimball a cease-and-desist letter a week later. It stated that Kimball's work was unauthorised and accused Kimball of using a DC Comics property without the express written permission of DC Comics. Kimball promptly took down the site he had set up for distributing his film, without contesting the company's claims. \"I thought I had done everything right. The movie had original music and legal music-library stuff, an original story, original special effects,\" says Kimball. Furthermore, there were no ad banners on his web site, and he did not sell or make videotape copies of his film. He insists, \"I treated Superman with respect. The only thing was I used the Superman logo, name and costume, and they shut me down.\" (When asked for its official stance on fan films based on its properties and for comment on the Kimball matter, DC Comics' publicity manager responded to Salon: \"DC Comics has a long history of energetically protecting its copyrights and trademarks. Therefore, we stand by our cease-and-desist letter in this particular case.\") While DC Comics takes the hard line, other media giants may be opting for a more enlightened approach - drawing their fans into the fold. Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, has an informal agreement with Star Wars fans: \"We love our fans, and we love it when they express their creativity and enthusiasm for Star Wars,\" emphasises Lynne Hale, Lucas' publicist. \"When it does cross the line, or when we do have a problem, is when they use Star Wars copyrighted materials for commercial use.\" Otherwise, Star Wars fan film-makers have the blessing of Lucas himself. On November 6, the official web site for the Star Wars movies and AtomFilms announced that they will partner to launch the Star Wars Fan Film Network later this year, which will feature fan-made movies. Lucasfilm is going so far as to make sound effects - from Darth Vader's breathing to the equally recognisable light saber hum - available from its library for fan film-makers to use. The Star Wars Fan Film Network even plans to pay fan film-makers through royalties generated from advertising and sponsorship related to the site. \"Soon, [copyright holders] are going to need those active fans more than ever before,\" says MIT's Jenkins. \"In a world with multiple media options, video on demand and micropayments, fans may become the new gatekeepers who help direct consumers toward interesting and engaging media content. The smart media executive should figure out which direction the media-consuming public is moving, run around in front and shout, 'Follow me.'\" What motivates most fan film-makers is the desire to see other stories based on their favourite movie, TV series or superhero. Young says fan films can also help to supply a missing piece of the story that, without their creative efforts, might never have been pursued by the original creators. Young points out that there are no new episodes or shows based on Highlander, the inspiration for his own creation. And after the critical and box-office drubbing of the last movie, Highlander: Endgame, the future of this franchise's film series is in doubt. Similarly, Lucas has stated that he will not make a sequel trilogy to his Star Wars saga. \"I see the Star Wars fan-film community only growing more once [Episode III is released],\" says Young. He feels that fan film-making has grown to such a point that \"if the creators won't give you more, now you can simply create more yourself.\" Considering the extent to which digital film-making and broadband internet technology have already advanced and converged, some of the more extreme possibilities of the fan-film scene may not sound so far-fetched: will there come a time when fans \"take over\" TV shows, movies or other media properties? Will fan film-makers create the next Star Wars trilogy in Lucas' place? \"In a few years, there could be 50 [fan-made] Star Trek series online,\" says Young. \"That is very exciting. It also forces the professionals to work harder and really pay attention to what fans want. Hey, we're making what we want to see. If that's not what they're producing, then they should catch a hint.\" Useful links \u0095 For Troops, go to theforce.net/troops; for Dark Redemption go to theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/darkredemption/index.shtml; for The X Files parody go to www.fountainheadpictures.com The Star Wars Fan Film Network will launch later this year, at www.starwars.atomfilms.com",

      "body": "<p>At best, a lieder recital is one of the most powerful, concentrated and subtle artistic experiences available to humanity. At worst it can be remote, suffocatingly constrained or downright cringe-making. It was no surprise to find that Bryn Terfel had packed the Symphony Hall to the rafters for his mostly German programme on Wednesday. The question was whether or not he could make this intimate medium work in a large concert hall, and for an audience that presumably was largely attracted by the prospect of hearing Terfel's splendid voice rather than by any special reverence for German romantic lieder. </p> <p>He did - and exceptionally well. Starting with Schumann's salon-storming ballad Die Beiden Grenadiere (The Two Grenadiers) was an inspiration in itself, but somehow Terfel managed both to camp it up and to make the ending deeply moving. We all thundered our approval - a faux pas in terms of Lieder recital etiquette, for unwritten rules dictate that you clap only at the end of each group of songs. Gently, with all his natural, unforced friendliness, Terfel put us right. </p> <p>That was another major achievement. It showed that to break through the traditional icy formality of a Lieder evening, you don't need populist gimmicks, just a fine artist with a human touch. After that, we were Play-doh in his hands. </p> <p>The rarefied beauty of Schumann's Widmung (Dedication) and the eerie riddle of Mein Wagen Rollet Langsam (My Carriage Lumbers Slowly) stood open to all. Attention remained fixed through Brahms's dark, agnostic meditations on death in Four Serious Songs. </p> <p>The voice itself is hypnotic enough.

      "bodyText": "At best, a lieder recital is one of the most powerful, concentrated and subtle artistic experiences available to humanity. At worst it can be remote, suffocatingly constrained or downright cringe-making. It was no surprise to find that Bryn Terfel had packed the Symphony Hall to the rafters for his mostly German programme on Wednesday. The question was whether or not he could make this intimate medium work in a large concert hall, and for an audience that presumably was largely attracted by the prospect of hearing Terfel's splendid voice rather than by any special reverence for German romantic lieder. He did - and exceptionally well. Starting with Schumann's salon-storming ballad Die Beiden Grenadiere (The Two Grenadiers) was an inspiration in itself, but somehow Terfel managed both to camp it up and to make the ending deeply moving. We all thundered our approval - a faux pas in terms of Lieder recital etiquette, for unwritten rules dictate that you clap only at the end of each group of songs. Gently, with all his natural, unforced friendliness, Terfel put us right. That was another major achievement. It showed that to break through the traditional icy formality of a Lieder evening, you don't need populist gimmicks, just a fine artist with a human touch. After that, we were Play-doh in his hands. The rarefied beauty of Schumann's Widmung (Dedication) and the eerie riddle of Mein Wagen Rollet Langsam (My Carriage Lumbers Slowly) stood open to all. Attention remained fixed through Brahms's dark, agnostic meditations on death in Four Serious Songs. The voice itself is hypnotic enough. But there's so much more: beautiful phrasing, and a feeling for the sense of each word that can make translation unnecessary - the deeper psychological meaning comes straight across, even if you can't speak a word of German. After this, and three very accessible Shakespeare settings by Schubert, John Ireland was a bit of an anticlimax. Granted, The Bells of San Marie and the Joyce setting Tutto E Sciolto are haunting, artful songs - but after Schubert, Brahms and Schumann? However George Butterworth, killed in action in the first world war at 31, emerged as a songwriter of real stature in his six Housman settings, particularly Is My Team ploughing?
