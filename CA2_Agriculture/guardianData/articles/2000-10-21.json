      "body": "<p>A black van driver unfairly disciplined at work has become one of the first people to benefit from the formation of a new racial discrimination legal advice unit. </p> <p>Kofi Asiedu was physically assaulted by his line manager at Euro Car Parts in Bellingham, south-east London, in August last year following an argument over a delivery. Mr Asiedu said at tribunal that his manager had called him a 'black prat' during the assault. The manager was given a verbal warning over the incident after making a full apology for the assault. But when Mr Asiedu complained about the attack, he was issued a final written warning which dragged up 10 minor disciplinary offences occurring over several years. </p> <p>Outraged, Mr Asiedu resigned and contacted the Race Discrimination Unit at the North Lambeth Law Centre in south London. The unit is designed to provide free legal advice and representation to people who are claiming racial discrimination in their workplace. </p> <p>Lawrence Davies, a solicitor and project manager for the unit, says the help provided is vital for those unable to afford legal advice and representation. Limited legal aid is available leading up to an employment tribunal (typically two hours' work at \u00a345 an hour, compared with the rate of \u00a370 for other legal aid work), but this is woefully inadequate to prepare a complicated case and no aid is provided for representation in the tribunal itself. Davies says: 'At present, 65 to 70 per cent of race claimants are not represented at tribunal, and only 5 per cent of unrepresented applicants win their cases.' </p> <p>Davies believes most claimants fail because they do not understand the legal processes or jargon involved in presenting a case. And they usually face fearsome opposition. 'For every litigant representing himself or herself, the employer has one or two sharp, experienced lawyers, and they tear them apart,' he says. </p> <p>To qualify for help from the unit, a claimant must live in a borough of London, have a case which has a reasonable chance of winning, and fall below a notional income limit (based on earnings, size of family and debts). Davies says the unit would probably not take on a single person earning more than \u00a320,000, or a couple with combined earnings of more than \u00a330,000. While these limits may seem high, so is the expense of taking your employer to court. The average discrimination tribunal costs between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,000 to prepare and present. And Davies says even those earning substantial salaries can find themselves in need of free legal help: 'When people are discriminated against, they often become stressed and unwell. You are likely to be signed off work and often end up on statutory sick pay of about \u00a350 a week.' </p> <p>The Race Discrimination Unit is a collaboration between the North Lambeth Law Centre and barristers at Two Garden Court, a set of chambers specialising in human rights work. The barristers are providing 100 days' tribunal representation at less than legal aid rates. The unit's catchment area comprises 12 million people, and the response since its launch in May has been strong, with 90 cases in the pipeline, three that have already concluded at tribunal but await compensation decisions, and eight that have settled out of court, producing total compensation of more than \u00a3160,000. </p> <p>Despite its success, the future of the unit is already threatened. Its first year has been funded to the tune of \u00a3150,000 by the Commission for Racial Equality whose core funding was supplemented by the Home Office. Another \u00a3100,000 was won by the Northern Complainant Aid Fund in Bradford to represent race claimants in the Midlands. But although CRE funding will go up next year, it expects an increase in demands on its resources, and there is no guarantee that the Race Discrimination Unit's funding will be renewed. Implementation of the Race Relations Amendment Bill early next year is likely to result in an increase in discrimination cases over stop and searches by the police and mental health sectioning. </p> <p>Others had been hopeful that the recently implemented Human Rights Convention would enable people to claim legal aid for representation at an employment tribunal. Article Six of the convention, which covers the right to a fair trial, states: 'In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.' </p> <p>However, Michael Burd, employment specialist at solicitors Lewis Silkin, is sceptical: 'The Government will fight this tooth and nail.' He believes the Government, which has dramatically reduced the number of firms handling legal aid cases from 11,000 in 1999 to 5,000 this year, will argue that claimants should be able to secure representation through the conditional fee agreement where the lawyer is only paid a fee if he wins the case. 'But unless you have got a case that's a dead cert, you are unlikely to want to take it on this basis.' </p> <p>Davies points out that even when a claimant's case is strong, a contingency fee offers little incentive to most lawyers: 'The average award for discrimination is between \u00a36,000 and \u00a38,000. This is bad business for solicitors on a 20 per cent contingency fee: they can earn much more by doing far less stressful and complex work.' </p> <p>Mr Asiedu, like many others who have faced discrimination in the workplace, did not have the skills to present his case at tribunal. But with the help of the Race Discrimination Unit, he has won. And although he is seeking a five-figure compensation payment, he says: 'I feel wonderful. It's not about the money but justice has been done.' </p> <p>\u0095 For further information contact the Race Discrimination Unit on 0207 793 0378, or visit <a href=\"http://www.rdu.org.uk\">www.rdu.org.uk</a>.

      "trailText": "<p>As more fund managers set up investment boutiques, the scope for smaller investors narrows. But for risk-takers the sky is the limit, as  Jill Insley  explains.</p>",
      "byline": "Jill Insley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the past few weeks several leading fund managers have announced they are quitting their jobs to set up their own 'investment boutiques'. </p> <p>Henderson is losing three of its technology team at the beginning of next year. Andrew Gibb, manager of the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, and Justin Seager, manager of the Dresdner RCM UK Equity Growth and Brunner Investment Trust, are also leaving to set up their own operations. </p> <p>Unfortunately, they will be moving outside the scope of most retail investors for the time being. Although the term 'investment boutique' sounds like a scaled down version of a traditional in-vestment house, boutiques are in fact involved in running highly specialist hedge funds for extremely wealthy investors - with a minimum of \u00a3100,000 to play with. </p> <p>The moves by all these managers is damaging to those investors holding units in their current funds. Jason Hollands, of London independent financial advisers Best Investment, says: 'The flow of star fund managers to boutiques and hedge funds is one of the biggest trends in the industry and threatens to starve the retail market of much of its talent. </p> <p>'The loss of Andrew Gibb, for example, is a real blow to M&amp;G. In the short time that he managed the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, he has turned it into the clear leader in this specialist sector. If you hold the fund, it's time to get out.' </p> <p>There are several reasons why fund managers are set-ting up their own operations. One is undoubtedly money. While fund managers are well paid, hedge-fund managers typically have a large share in the business, and are paid a performance-related fee. 'Why retire with \u00a32million or \u00a33m in the bank when you can have \u00a350m or \u00a3100m by setting up your own business?' is how one manager puts it. </p> <p>Investment freedom is also very important. Scott McGlashan, who quit Perpetual at the beginning of the year to set up Jade Ab-solute, a boutique specialising in Far Eastern hedging, says: 'Perpetual had grown to such a size that it was no longer the entrepreneurial business it once was. Once investment houses reach a certain size, they become less flexible in how they manage money, and more fixated on benchmarks and weightings. It's less satisfying for a fund manager to work in these conditions.' McGlashan believes hedging will have an important role for anyone wanting to generate returns in unpredictable or bear markets. </p> <p>'We've been living in an environment where inves-tors assumed that markets just went up year after year, and that the buy and hold policy of long-term investment therefore worked. But in the type of markets that we've seen recently, that policy is a disaster. There is the possibility that we're now at the start of a bear market which could last for several years. This means a buy and hold policy is inappropriate.' </p> <p>Hedging is usually seen as a highly risky method of in-vestment. This is partly be-cause hedge funds are usually only reported on when they collapse, resulting in multi-million pound losses, or in conjunction with fi-nancial gurus such as George Soros, who made \u00a31bn out of sterling leaving European Monetary Union through his own hedge fund. </p> <p>But the definition of hedging is to secure against loss, and hedge fund managers claim that many of the funds incorporating hedge strategies are less volatile and risky than normal equity-based funds. </p> <p>Traditional in-vestment is based on a 'buy and hold' strategy, where fund managers buy certain shares in an attempt to outperform the market, but generally their performance reflects the direction of the stock market. In contrast, the aim of hedge funds, often referred to as alternative investment strategy funds, is to produce positive month by month returns, regardless of what happens in the stock market. </p> <p>There are several methods of hedging, involving different levels of risk and reward, but the most common is the long/short strategy. A fund using this strategy might focus on regions such as the US or Europe or on a specific sector such as technology. The manager attempts to beat the market by buying and holding shares that he thinks will go up by more than the market (this is the long part of the strategy). </p> <p>He also tries to make money by selling shares or other financial instruments (futures and options) that he believes will fall further than the rest of the market, and then rebuying them at a lower price (selling short). Rather than buying the shares he is going to sell short, the manager borrows them from a specialist broker, and pays interest to the broker for the loan of the stock. If he thinks the market generally will go up, more of his fund will be invested long, and if he thinks the market will fall, he will invest more of the portfolio on a short basis. </p> <p>For example, a manager might start with \u00a320,000, borrow a further \u00a320,000 and use the whole lot to buy UK shares. At the same time he borrows and then sells \u00a330,000 of FTSE All Share Index futures. This means his net long exposure is \u00a310,000 (\u00a340,000 less \u00a330,000), just half his initial capital. If the value of the shares he has bought rises by 5 per cent while the market remains flat, he will make a return of \u00a32,000 (\u00a340,000 times 5 per cent). </p> <p>However, if the manager gets his bets wrong, the losses can be dramatic, particularly where the fund has borrowed heavily to buy investments. And the investment freedom that has attracted so many managers can prove very dangerous for investors. </p> <p>Bridget Cleverly, of Matrix Money Management, says: 'A fund manager who has a good track record may begin to do things differently and move away from his previously successful approach without consulting anyone. Because of the wide mandates open to AIS fund managers, this is much easier and more common than in the mutual fund industry. This is why constant monitoring is so important.' </p> <p>For this reason, the Financial Services Authority and its predecessors have re-fused to allow hedge funds to be marketed in the UK, and only a very few specialist independent financial advisers and stockbrokers are willing to advise on them. </p> <p>Nearly all hedge funds are domiciled in the Cayman Islands, which does not charge tax on any returns. But although gains are rolled up in the share price, they will be subject to income rather than capital gains tax when brought back into the UK. </p> <p>Although it is too expensive and risky for most people to invest directly into hedge funds, it is possible to spread risk by investing in a fund of hedge funds. The Alternative Investment Strategies fund is a \u00a361m investment trust managed by International Asset Managers, an investment firm that has dealt in hedge funds for the past 20 years. </p> <p>Alan Djanogly, manager of the fund since its launch in December 1996, runs a conservative, diversified portfolio, investing in 15 to 20 large hedge funds. </p> <p>The fund's shares are mostly held by institutional investors such as the Co-op and Chase Flemings, but International Asset Managers is about to start promoting the fund to retail investors, providing a pack that explains hedging and the fund's strategy, and the option to put the fund's shares in an ISA run by a private client broker. Al-though the trust is denominated in dollars, its shares can be bought through normal broking channels at UK dealing prices. </p> <p>Private bank Leopold Jo-seph has also launched a fund of hedge funds for cautious investors, with a minimum subscription of US$50,000. Matrix Money Management is planning to launch another fund of hedge funds next year, concentrating on funds using low-risk, low-volatility strategies, for \u00a310,000 minimum. </p> <p>Djanogly believes that a fund of funds is the only suitable way for ordinary private investors to get involved with hedge funds. </p> <p>'There are about 7,000 hedge funds available at the moment. I see 200 managers a quarter and of those I expect to find four or five who are of real interest. We try to cherrypick, but the average investor won't have the resources or capital to find the best managers.' </p> <p> For more on hedge funds try <a href=\"http://www.hedgeworld.com\">www.hedgeworld.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aima.org\">www.aima.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eurohedge.co.uk\">www.eurohedge.co.uk</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the past few weeks several leading fund managers have announced they are quitting their jobs to set up their own 'investment boutiques'. Henderson is losing three of its technology team at the beginning of next year. Andrew Gibb, manager of the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, and Justin Seager, manager of the Dresdner RCM UK Equity Growth and Brunner Investment Trust, are also leaving to set up their own operations. Unfortunately, they will be moving outside the scope of most retail investors for the time being. Although the term 'investment boutique' sounds like a scaled down version of a traditional in-vestment house, boutiques are in fact involved in running highly specialist hedge funds for extremely wealthy investors - with a minimum of \u00a3100,000 to play with. The moves by all these managers is damaging to those investors holding units in their current funds. Jason Hollands, of London independent financial advisers Best Investment, says: 'The flow of star fund managers to boutiques and hedge funds is one of the biggest trends in the industry and threatens to starve the retail market of much of its talent. 'The loss of Andrew Gibb, for example, is a real blow to M&amp;G. In the short time that he managed the M&amp;G European Smaller Companies fund, he has turned it into the clear leader in this specialist sector. If you hold the fund, it's time to get out.' There are several reasons why fund managers are set-ting up their own operations. One is undoubtedly money. While fund managers are well paid, hedge-fund managers typically have a large share in the business, and are paid a performance-related fee. 'Why retire with \u00a32million or \u00a33m in the bank when you can have \u00a350m or \u00a3100m by setting up your own business?' is how one manager puts it. Investment freedom is also very important. Scott McGlashan, who quit Perpetual at the beginning of the year to set up Jade Ab-solute, a boutique specialising in Far Eastern hedging, says: 'Perpetual had grown to such a size that it was no longer the entrepreneurial business it once was. Once investment houses reach a certain size, they become less flexible in how they manage money, and more fixated on benchmarks and weightings. It's less satisfying for a fund manager to work in these conditions.' McGlashan believes hedging will have an important role for anyone wanting to generate returns in unpredictable or bear markets. 'We've been living in an environment where inves-tors assumed that markets just went up year after year, and that the buy and hold policy of long-term investment therefore worked. But in the type of markets that we've seen recently, that policy is a disaster. There is the possibility that we're now at the start of a bear market which could last for several years. This means a buy and hold policy is inappropriate.' Hedging is usually seen as a highly risky method of in-vestment. This is partly be-cause hedge funds are usually only reported on when they collapse, resulting in multi-million pound losses, or in conjunction with fi-nancial gurus such as George Soros, who made \u00a31bn out of sterling leaving European Monetary Union through his own hedge fund. But the definition of hedging is to secure against loss, and hedge fund managers claim that many of the funds incorporating hedge strategies are less volatile and risky than normal equity-based funds. Traditional in-vestment is based on a 'buy and hold' strategy, where fund managers buy certain shares in an attempt to outperform the market, but generally their performance reflects the direction of the stock market. In contrast, the aim of hedge funds, often referred to as alternative investment strategy funds, is to produce positive month by month returns, regardless of what happens in the stock market. There are several methods of hedging, involving different levels of risk and reward, but the most common is the long/short strategy. A fund using this strategy might focus on regions such as the US or Europe or on a specific sector such as technology. The manager attempts to beat the market by buying and holding shares that he thinks will go up by more than the market (this is the long part of the strategy). He also tries to make money by selling shares or other financial instruments (futures and options) that he believes will fall further than the rest of the market, and then rebuying them at a lower price (selling short). Rather than buying the shares he is going to sell short, the manager borrows them from a specialist broker, and pays interest to the broker for the loan of the stock. If he thinks the market generally will go up, more of his fund will be invested long, and if he thinks the market will fall, he will invest more of the portfolio on a short basis. For example, a manager might start with \u00a320,000, borrow a further \u00a320,000 and use the whole lot to buy UK shares. At the same time he borrows and then sells \u00a330,000 of FTSE All Share Index futures. This means his net long exposure is \u00a310,000 (\u00a340,000 less \u00a330,000), just half his initial capital. If the value of the shares he has bought rises by 5 per cent while the market remains flat, he will make a return of \u00a32,000 (\u00a340,000 times 5 per cent). However, if the manager gets his bets wrong, the losses can be dramatic, particularly where the fund has borrowed heavily to buy investments. And the investment freedom that has attracted so many managers can prove very dangerous for investors. Bridget Cleverly, of Matrix Money Management, says: 'A fund manager who has a good track record may begin to do things differently and move away from his previously successful approach without consulting anyone. Because of the wide mandates open to AIS fund managers, this is much easier and more common than in the mutual fund industry. This is why constant monitoring is so important.' For this reason, the Financial Services Authority and its predecessors have re-fused to allow hedge funds to be marketed in the UK, and only a very few specialist independent financial advisers and stockbrokers are willing to advise on them. Nearly all hedge funds are domiciled in the Cayman Islands, which does not charge tax on any returns. But although gains are rolled up in the share price, they will be subject to income rather than capital gains tax when brought back into the UK. Although it is too expensive and risky for most people to invest directly into hedge funds, it is possible to spread risk by investing in a fund of hedge funds. The Alternative Investment Strategies fund is a \u00a361m investment trust managed by International Asset Managers, an investment firm that has dealt in hedge funds for the past 20 years. Alan Djanogly, manager of the fund since its launch in December 1996, runs a conservative, diversified portfolio, investing in 15 to 20 large hedge funds. The fund's shares are mostly held by institutional investors such as the Co-op and Chase Flemings, but International Asset Managers is about to start promoting the fund to retail investors, providing a pack that explains hedging and the fund's strategy, and the option to put the fund's shares in an ISA run by a private client broker. Al-though the trust is denominated in dollars, its shares can be bought through normal broking channels at UK dealing prices. Private bank Leopold Jo-seph has also launched a fund of hedge funds for cautious investors, with a minimum subscription of US$50,000. Matrix Money Management is planning to launch another fund of hedge funds next year, concentrating on funds using low-risk, low-volatility strategies, for \u00a310,000 minimum. Djanogly believes that a fund of funds is the only suitable way for ordinary private investors to get involved with hedge funds. 'There are about 7,000 hedge funds available at the moment. I see 200 managers a quarter and of those I expect to find four or five who are of real interest. We try to cherrypick, but the average investor won't have the resources or capital to find the best managers.' For more on hedge funds try www.hedgeworld.com, www.aima.org and www.eurohedge.co.uk.",

Don't laugh: the dismal state of English football holds up a merciless mirror to the condition of British management as a whole. </p> <p>Consider the paradox of the English Premiership. It is the richest league in the world, containing in Manchester United the most valuable club and a global sporting brand. Its players are millionaires. Yet its strengths are as superficial as an internet retailer's profits. While the Premiership clubs are top of the league at making money by any means available, they can't between them produce a national team to beat Finland. </p> <p>Compared with their foreign counterparts English players are embarrassingly underskilled, underprepared and undereducated. And it's not just the players who are lacking. English managers too, as Kevin Keegan had the honesty to admit, are one-sidedly short of the technical and professional skills needed at top level. No club with a realistic chance of winning the Premiership has an Englishman in charge. No wonder Keegan thinks he is not the man for the job: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has a PhD in economics, for goodness sake. </p> <p>As in football, so in other industries.

      "bodyText": "Football, the late Liverpool manager Bill Shankly famously said, was not a matter of life and death: it was much more serious than that. Don't laugh: the dismal state of English football holds up a merciless mirror to the condition of British management as a whole. Consider the paradox of the English Premiership. It is the richest league in the world, containing in Manchester United the most valuable club and a global sporting brand. Its players are millionaires. Yet its strengths are as superficial as an internet retailer's profits. While the Premiership clubs are top of the league at making money by any means available, they can't between them produce a national team to beat Finland. Compared with their foreign counterparts English players are embarrassingly underskilled, underprepared and undereducated. And it's not just the players who are lacking. English managers too, as Kevin Keegan had the honesty to admit, are one-sidedly short of the technical and professional skills needed at top level. No club with a realistic chance of winning the Premiership has an Englishman in charge. No wonder Keegan thinks he is not the man for the job: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has a PhD in economics, for goodness sake. As in football, so in other industries. UK firms pride themselves on their profits, their deal-making ability and the zillions they pay their top earners. Yet the economy as a whole is as flexible and attractive to support as, well, an England football side on a wet Wembley afternoon. Prices are among the highest in western Europe - even allowing for the exchange rate; a symptom of inefficiency or exploitation, if not both. Productivity remain obstinately 30 per cent below that of the US, and 25 per cent below that of France and Germany. The public sector is a morass of low morale and poor standards. With a few exceptions, such as pharmaceuticals, the UK industries that work are foreign-owned (the flip side of burgeoning inward investment) and/or foreign-managed: cars, electronics, the City, even retail.

That makes managers as steadfast as a weathervane, a prey to fads and fashions and perversely overreliant on market mechanisms to guide them.

Even mighty Microsoft has seen its market capitalisation more than halve this year (before recovering this week). The latest casualty is Boxman.com, thought to be one of the most viable e-retailers, which sells CDs on the net from a central warehouse. This week it announced it was facing liquidation. </p> <p>A year ago it was so different. Venture capitalists - hitherto a rare sighting in Britain's capital markets - appeared from nowhere and were falling over themselves to lend money to almost any young person with a business plan in their knapsack and the word \"internet\" in the executive summary. The word \"dot.com\" - American, of course - soon became a sassy suffix for coolness in business.. </p> <p>The explosion of web start-ups in the UK was heralded as the start of a New Economy, albeit blown in by a transatlantic wind. In this new world, the internet would lower prices by cutting out the middle person while enabling budding entrepreneurs to start up global businesses from their back bedrooms. Any company that didn't embrace the world wide web for selling (and purchasing), would be smothered by those that did. </p> <p>So what went wrong?

      "bodyText": "It is difficult to move at the moment without hearing the sound of crashing dot.com companies. It started in the spring, when free-spending sports retailer, Boo.com, bit the dust, and has been gathering pace ever since. The fall in European shares has been happening against the descant of a worldwide slump in technology stocks that has seen high-flyers like Priceline (the US pioneer of customers bidding online for airline tickets) fall by 42% in a single day. Yahoo, one of the strongest net stocks, suffered a 27% fall in its share price last week. Even mighty Microsoft has seen its market capitalisation more than halve this year (before recovering this week). The latest casualty is Boxman.com, thought to be one of the most viable e-retailers, which sells CDs on the net from a central warehouse. This week it announced it was facing liquidation. A year ago it was so different. Venture capitalists - hitherto a rare sighting in Britain's capital markets - appeared from nowhere and were falling over themselves to lend money to almost any young person with a business plan in their knapsack and the word \"internet\" in the executive summary. The word \"dot.com\" - American, of course - soon became a sassy suffix for coolness in business.. The explosion of web start-ups in the UK was heralded as the start of a New Economy, albeit blown in by a transatlantic wind. In this new world, the internet would lower prices by cutting out the middle person while enabling budding entrepreneurs to start up global businesses from their back bedrooms. Any company that didn't embrace the world wide web for selling (and purchasing), would be smothered by those that did. So what went wrong? Nearly all the early claims of the internet were, and still are, true. Yes, it is an all-embracing change that will transform the way we do business, the way we are educated, and the way we are entertained. What the preppy-preneurs forgot, however, was the importance of two rules of the old economy and one of the new.

      "body": "<p>The quokka is like a rat the size of a cat. But they don't scuttle like rats. And they've none of the imperious cunning of a cat. They stumble around just wanting to be loved, a very cute and dim marsupial which lives virtually nowhere in the world except on Rottnest Island, off the coast of Perth. </p> <p>They do all right, there's about 10,000 of them, and they adore tourists - emerging from the undergrowth to wave down buses and pose for their photocalls. </p> <p>Admittedly, the end of the school year is a fraught time, when the footie-loving boys from Perth and Fremantle arrive on \"Rotto\" with their crates of Swan to celebrate freedom. But the authorities reckon they've cracked down on the worst excesses of the vicious \"quokka soccer\" phenomenon. </p> <p>Rottnest has a checkered past, it's true, being a former Aboriginal penal settlement and a prisoner-of-war camp, but it is a truly beautiful, fascinating island, 11km by 5km, and a great day trip. </p> <p>The best way to travel is by bicycle. Cycle to a secluded bay, white sands, Indian Ocean water like Evian, sunbathe for a while. Cycle some more. Make friends with the quokkas. Enjoy the unique environment - where else will you find Rottnest Island pine trees? Indulge in the snorkelling. If you want to watch the humpback whales continue on their migration, you have until December. If birds are your thing, osprey patrol the southern coast while cormorants are frequent visitors. And then back to the Rottnest Island tea rooms for food - try the stir fried beef and fried rice. </p> <p>We arrived at Rottnest on the ferry from Fremantle - a return trip with Boat Torque Cruises <a href=\"http://www.boattorque.com.au\">www.boattorque.com</a> costs from \u00a350. They also take a glass-bottomed boat out from the island. </p> <p>There is no better way to get to Fremantle than to cruise down the Swan River, a vast, relaxing waterway where you'll be unlucky if the dolphins don't decide to help you along. (Try <a href=\"http://www.captaincookcruises.com.au\">www.captaincookcruises.com.au</a> - return trip \u00a310.50 including wine tasting.) </p> <p>Perth itself is a stunning city. After two hours, I wanted to emigrate. It is one of the most isolated cities in the world and, as a result, all life is relaxed, harmonious. </p> <p>Locals will tell you that not only is Perth the sunniest state capital in Australia but it also has the best beaches. Cottesloe Beach in particular is idyllic, and lunch at the Indiana restaurant a real joy. Indeed any foodie will be knocked out by Perth. The place is teeming with fine restaurants. </p> <p>If you want to push the boat out, one of the best is Fraser's in the vast Kings Park with amazing views of the entire city. The special on the evening I was there was panfried barramundi with asparagus and spinach. </p> <p>At night, Perth becomes a warm version of Manchester, vibrant, exciting with endless places to eat and drink. A good plan would be to head to Northbridge, north of the city centre, to eat Chinese, Thai, Singapore or just a bowl of pasta. Then go drinking in the fashionable Subiaco district. </p> <p>Around 80% of Western Australia's 1.8m population live in Perth - yet the state takes up a third of Australia. Out of town is awesome, empty country. </p> <p>Flying is by far the best way to get around. We flew from Perth to Paraburdoo and made a base for two nights in the small archetypal mining town of Tom Price. </p> <p>This place is as rough and ready as it gets. It's more or less owned by Hamersly Iron and was built in 1962. Train engines pull endless carriages of iron ore - about 22,000 tonnes - from Tom Price to the coast. </p> <p>The town's only pub - known locally as the animal bar - could almost be a Newcastle working men's club. There's pool tables (best to stick to the locals' rules), a makeshift betting area, the archaic unused discotheque equipment sitting sadly in the corner, a jukebox with an amazing collection of John Cougar. But the men holding up the bar are good company, partly through amazement that a tourist would want to go there but also from genuine friendliness. </p> <p>A drive out of Tom Price and you're in the Karijini national park, stunningly rugged terrain in the heart of the Pilbara region, one of the oldest land formations on earth. The Aboriginal people have lived here for 30,000 years, arriving by sea, it is thought, from the islands of what is now Indonesia. </p> <p>The park's tourist centre, interesting though it is, is still very much a large tent, but by next year a new $3m centre should be open. But you don't come here for man-made things, you come for the gorges, the stunning views, the walk through nature. </p> <p>Our guide for the day was Tim Baird of Design-a-Tour (<a href=\"http://www.dat.com.au\">www.dat.com.au</a>) who lead us down red gorge paths, past shimmering white gum trees, paper trees, fig trees even, into subterranean aquamarine pools and waterways where you can swim, hang out and marvel at the beauty without another soul in sight. </p> <p>Karijini is not full of tourists - only 35,000-40,000 come here each year, and most Western Australians are ignorant of the intense, breathtaking beauty of the place. </p> <p>From Tom Price, we drove west through land rich in wildlife: kangaroos, emus and bungarras - a very fast 4ft long lizard which would not be out of place on the Walking with Dinosaurs set. If you want real outback, this is it. </p> <p>Isolated sheep stations are increasingly opening their doors to tourists. We stayed at Giralia, 100km south of Exmouth. The place is massive, about 265,000 hectares with up to 25,000 sheep. Dinner, bed and breakast costs between $50 and $90 a night. If you can't get in touch with your inner self here, then consider a clinic. </p> <p>The vastness takes your breath away. It's a ferociously empty, beautiful land where the pioneers are still alive and working. </p> <p>Another long drive and we're on the coast. Forget the clogged commercial beauty of the Great Barrier Reef on the east coast, the Ningaloo is, at 260km, the longest fringing reef in the world, protecting a lagoon teeming with the most incredible marine life. People here are rightly proud of the marine beauty and diversity - and anxious for it not to go the way of the reef on the other side of Australia. </p> <p>The beaches could be from Bounty adverts - white sand, achingly gorgeous blue-green water, and, of course, the all-year sun. Along the reef, take your pick, there's so much room here. Turquoise beach is popular with snorkellers and Osprey Bay is a fine place to just fall asleep. </p> <p>We were based in Exmouth, a reinvented former naval base offering high-standard accommodation from as little as \u00a320 a night. A backpacker can stay for about \u00a36 a night. </p> <p>Neil McLeod, an archetypal outback man if ever there was one, operates a one-day safari for about \u00a395 in his OKA - an ungainly Australian-built vehicle which seems to use tank engineering to create the coach that will go anywhere. </p> <p>You will see a lot of kangaroos as you drive through western Australia, most of them, lamentably, dead by the road. But McLeod takes you to places you're not allowed, where there are large communities of kangaroos airily passing the time until spooked by something. They then get in a right fluster and hop crazily all over the place. You can, unfortunately, see why so many end up by the side of the road. </p> <p>The highlight of the McLeod safari is Yardie Creek, 90km from Exmouth, which runs in from the ocean over a sand bank through intimidating vertical red rock. This is one of the few domains of the threatened black-footed rock wallaby which manages to survive in tight crevices and on impossibly small ledges. Seventy years ago, these timid, fascinating, marsupials were abundant across Australia but proved easy prey, mostly killed off by foxes. No one's going to get them here. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Mark Brown travelled with Travelbag (0870 7377779 <a href=\"http://www.travelbag .co.uk\">www.travelbag .co.uk</a>) which organise tailormade holidays and flights to Australia.

Our guide Chino, who has a lot of Guarani Indian blood, said that two young Indian lovers were canoeing downriver, escaping the wrath of a god when he made the riverbed collapse in front of them.

      "body": "<p>It has never been music to potter around the house to, or to sip cocktails to, or to wake up to on a bright Sunday morning: Polly Jean Harvey's music has always been reserved for those long, dark nights of the soul - guaranteed to make us feel much worse, but somehow better at the same time. It has been her job to Feel Our Pain. Her songs have been bleak, angry, ghoulish. And Harvey herself, all paper-doll fragility, has always been the incarnation of angst, yowling her scary, disconcerting lyrics about unsettling things (voodoo, drowning, coffins, guns). She may never have possessed the distinctive grandeur of her most obvious predecessor, Patti Smith, but she blazed a trail of slow-burning sensuality, fury and eccentricity that helped bring women's rock out of the margins and into the charts in the late 90s. She was always a cut above the maudlin Morissettes and Phairs of this world. The only trouble was that, after a while, Harvey seemed to have so much more pain to feel than the rest of us could muster. </p> <p>Until recently, that is. There were signs of a slight breeziness on her last album, and there are tracks on the latest one that even have an optimism and lightness of touch previously unheard of from the supposed cauldron-stirring lady of darkness. In the flesh, though not exactly serene-looking, Harvey looks tanned and fit, as opposed to pallid and unwell, formerly her salient characteristics. She's tiny, but not spectrally thin, as she has been in the past, and she has strikingly large, long-lashed, hazel eyes and a wide, full mouth that goes slightly wonky when she speaks in her soft, West Country lilt. She has an intense, measured way about her. She's very still and composed, speaking confidently but also cautiously, articulating each sentence carefully. </p> <p>She says that her new album, Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea, is so named not so much because of the locations in which it was written (New York and Dorset), but because she has always liked the Jungian notion of \"the sea being the subconscious and the land the conscious\". The creative process draws from reality, she says, but also from the imagination, and is about returning to the imagination that we had as children. \"It seems to me that we spend a lot of our lives trying to get back to that simplicity, the vibrant imagination, we had as kids.\" </p> <p>She's not nostalgic about her childhood, though - \"I don't dwell too much on things that have gone. I try and live on a day-to-day basis\" - and won't go into enormous detail about her childhood, because she doesn't want to. But she does say that Dorset was a wonderful place to grow up, and \"alive with ideas and the space in which to create them\". Her mother, a sculptor, and her father, a stonemason, brought up their daughter to the sound of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker. The Harveys lived near a remote village with a population of 600, and their house, along with a few others, was set apart. There was no shop, just a post office and a telephone box. Polly used to hang around with a group of local boys. \"We had a gang in our offshoot village, and there were just boys. No girls to play with.\" Harvey began playing piano, violin and saxophone at the age of 11, and then taught herself to play the guitar at 18 - she'd been interested in writing since she was a child, and found that it was a good way to bring words and music together. </p> <p>Now 30, Harvey still lives for most of the time in Dorset, in a house by the sea. She's very close to her parents, and always plays them early demo tapes of her albums, because she respects their opinion and because they have a lot of musical knowledge and interest. \"It seems appropriate,\" she says. Having bohemian parents, her teenage rebellion took a rather different form than most. \"My rebellious stage was probably when I started buying Duran Duran records instead of listening to Captain Beefheart,\" she laughs, \"and my mum was, like, 'What on earth are you listening to?'\" </p> <p>She was 20 years old when she moved to London, and decided to defer a place to study sculpture at St Martin's art school in favour of signing a record deal. But the transfer from the countryside - and from the bosom of such a tightknit family - was a shock. In 1992, she released Dry. It was a jagged, raw album, drawing on swampy blues, with hints of Patti Smith, Captain Beefheart and grunge thrown in - the songs were angry and intense, the vocal style was a distinctive, banshee-like roar. Everything started happening at once, she says, and what should have been an exciting time, full of hope, turned into a nightmare - and the first of two nervous breakdowns. </p> <p>For a start, she was unprepared for press interviews, she says. \"I'd had quite a sheltered upbringing, and was very open and honest, and so went to interviews totally unprotected.\" Of course, that candour did her public profile absolutely no harm - she was an interviewer's dream, but she believes it harmed her. \"I was just wide open, and got damaged because of it, and ended up feeling very invaded.\" At the time, she was struggling with money, negotiating with solicitors, managers (she went through two of them) and agents. \"It was quite frightening, and all too much. Then my personal life was in tatters at the same time [she had split from photographer Joe Dilworth]. I don't know what the definition of a nervous breakdown is. I just know that I stopped functioning properly, and I was unable to look after myself, and everything kind of fell apart.\" She went back home to Dorset and \"shut off for a while\". </p> <p>The follow-up album, Rid Of Me, was no less harrowing or dark, and still full of fury and naked emotion - on the title track, she toyed with male fears of the Fatal Attraction-style bunny-boiling woman. It was her most relentless, hit-free album. The third, To Bring You My Love, was less emotionally direct but intense nonetheless, earning her a place on the Mercury Prize shortlist and a clutch of Grammy nominations. Until then, her appearance had been austere - scraped-back hair, no make-up - but with the release in 1995 of To Bring You My Love, she underwent a Ziggy Stardust-style transformation, appearing at Glastonbury in a smoulderingly glamorous ensemble of pink catsuit and exaggerated false eyelashes. \"The songs could carry it,\" she says of her image at the time. \"I've always enjoyed dressing up, and I wanted to experiment with it.\" There was a dark, theatrical edge to her performances, and her distorted, wailing told of drowned daughters and voodoo rituals. The glam image had to do with something else as well, she says: \"There was confusion with myself at that time as to who or what I was, and it was a way of looking for answers.\" </p> <p>Another breakdown ensued. The period from the end of 1995 until 1997 was a \"very dark time\", she says. By the tail end of 1995 she had been on tour for a year and was \"very worn and very disillusioned. Emotionally, mentally or physically, it wasn't a healthy time. I was running on empty. I'd kind of lost sight of why I was doing this, and I don't think that would've happened if I'd have been of stronger mind and body but, as it was, I was just very low, so I really hit the bottom of the barrel and thought about stopping it all and not even continuing with music. Even through to Dance Hall At Louse Point [a dance collaboration with John Parish and choreographer Mark Bruce], it was a very difficult time in my life, probably the hardest time I've ever had.\" She says she's not sure why it happened a second time around. \"I just think every individual is predisposed to behaving in certain ways under certain conditions, and I think it was a mixture of the person that I am, the spirit that I have, and being in those situations that wasn't right for me at that time.\" </p> <p>She was also, of course, painfully thin - and lurid rumours abounded. The phrase \"self-loathing\" was used a lot: it seemed to tally well with her nihilistic lyrics. It was generally assumed that she was anorexic; Courtney Love, a great admirer, once pointed out that one of Harvey's lyrics about lying in a glass coffin was, in Jungian theory, an image representing an eating disorder. \"I think that everyone's entitled to their own opinion,\" Harvey says carefully. \"Certainly, when I used that image I wasn't thinking about that at the time. I was probably thinking more of Snow White. Maybe Snow White was anorexic,\" she laughs. It may be that her skeletal appearance was due to something entirely different. In any case, it's not something she has ever talked about publicly, or admitted to. \"That's a conscious decision,\" she says firmly. \"And I'm not going to talk about it now. That's no one's business but my own.\" She went to stay with friends in Bristol. \"I had a lot of support around me.\" She went into psychotherapy. Is This Desire?, a rather more upbeat album, followed in 1998. </p> <p>But it is the new album that really shows Polly Jean Harvey in a different light. There are still the angry moments of visceral guitar rock for which she has become known, and the hallmark blues and orchestral balladry are there, too, albeit more finely honed. But there's a new mood that is less claustrophobic, less sinister and more positive, both lyrically and musically. She produced and performed all the tracks, along with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. The vocals are less technically distorted than on previous ones, which sometimes goes in her favour and sometimes doesn't - there is the occasional moment when she seems to be struggling to hit the note - but it's a beautiful, seductive album, and probably her most commercial and accessible to date. The country-inflected ballad, You Said Something, for instance, and the elegiac, piano-filled We Float, with its soaring vocals, are gorgeous, and there are Bj\u00f6rkish touches in the love song, Beautiful Feeling. Then there's This Mess We're In, a soft duet with the haunting voice of Thom Yorke of Radiohead. She finds Yorke's voice very moving: \"He's an extremely good songwriter, and instrumentally they're a very strong band. They do seem to be looking for new ground all the time, which is admirable, and very exciting to see and to hear.\" It has been said that Polly Harvey is the female version of Radiohead and that, just as the music of Thom Yorke mythologises male confusion and dysfunction, so hers represents the female equivalent. She doesn't see it, however: \"They're just songs about living, not about one sex or another.\" </p> <p>Gender has never been an issue with her. She says that most of her influences have been male (Dylan, Neil Young, Captain Beefheart), because that's what she's drawn to musically, and there's no other woman to whom she aspires, though she admires Marianne Faithfull. She has never come across obstacles that have been insurmountable through being a woman, she says; she just operates from her own gut instinct. When she first emerged on the music scene, she was briefly assumed to be of a feminist inclination, then she caused a stir by posing topless on the cover of NME. \"It wasn't premeditated, and I was quite unprepared for the uproar that it caused. I really hadn't thought that was how people would react.\" </p> <p>Whether this response is naive or disingenuous is hard to say. Surely she's aware of her own sexual presence - it's certainly not something she plays down in either her music or her performances. \"Obviously, I'm aware of that and I love playing with it, and I think that sexuality is a very big part of music and of performing and making images. It would be like denying part of my character not to do it. Music's a very sexual thing. It's much more to do with the physical than the intellectual.\" </p> <p>Not that her songs are about sex. \"They're about emotions that go with love in any form, love of a cat, God, a person, the world, the countryside, anything. Some of that is sexual love. I think all songs are love songs - they're all about love or lack of love.\" She doesn't like to talk about her lyrics in detail because she believes that, once she has released her songs, it is up to the listeners to interpret them. </p> <p>The trouble with such reticence, however, is that you will often be caricatured in terms of your more extreme lyrical moments. From the time of her first album, Harvey was perceived as an angry, macabre eccentric, a witchy \"Dark Lady\", and that image has stuck. \"People like to categorise you,\" she says, \"and it happens to a lot of people. Some of my male friends are always thought of as these dark, macabre, melancholy miseries, and then you meet them and they're the funniest people with great senses of humour. Certainly a lot of my work has looked into the darker side of things, because that's what fascinated me at the time, but I think you do have to see it in context. I've been doing this for 10 years, and my work is miles away now from what it used to be.\" </p> <p>Perhaps in an attempt to escape the confines of the Polly Jean Harvey persona, she has in the past few years experimented with acting, appearing in a few short films, including a musical cameo (as a bunny girl) in Sarah Miles's A Bunny Girl's Tale. She also acted in New York director Hal Hartley's The Book Of Life, a millennial satire. She had met Hartley when he used some of her tracks in his 1994 film Amateur. </p> <p>She found acting both fascinating and \"very difficult\", and, though she's wary of the \"now I'm a pop star I can be an actress/write a novel\" syndrome, she would like to do more acting. In The Book Of Life, she plays the role of a modern-day Mary Magdalene. The Harveys were not a church-going family - \"Quite the opposite: very rarely did we go\" - but while researching the part she became fascinated by Christianity and the Bible . So much so that today she wears a crucifix around her neck. Does she have a religious faith? \"I don't know if I could answer that really yet,\" she says cautiously. \"I have my own beliefs, which I probably won't talk about. It's a very important part of my interest, and I'm aware of religion and its impact on everyone and everything.\" There was a time when she was portrayed as some kind of black magic sorceress, and there has been such darkness in her songs, let alone in her psyche, that you can't help wondering if she believes there are any forces of good at work in the world. \"Yes, I live with hope that things can change and people can change.\" </p> <p>Her music, she says, is \"a place where I can try and give something to others that might help in some way. I make the songs, and I hand them over and then people can make them their own. Music can say a lot of things that words can't express.\" She seems keen to distance herself from the violence that is still present even in some of her new songs. She can't help but respond to what is going on around her, she says: \"As a writer, I think it's one's duty to keep what's going on within your work. It's a personal response to what I hear and read and see.\" </p> <p>Of course, there's more to it than saintly duty and altruism - there's a steely, ambitious side to Harvey as well. There's the Polly Harvey who disbanded the group, known collectively as PJ Harvey, after the first two albums, with the name, of course, reverting to her - they're her songs, it's her career, and that, it seems, is the way she likes it. And with the shrewd and powerful Paul McGuinness (also U2's manager) now in charge of her business, she is well placed for a long and fruitful career. Her main ambition, though, is not, she insists, to sell more records and become more famous, but to improve her writing - both her songwriting and her poetry and prose, with which she has been experimenting lately. She likes the discipline required to write poetry. \"There are a lot more records in me yet, and it takes hard work and dedication. I want to keep doing that as I want to do it, and not be swayed by outside influences.\" </p> <p>She seems a self-sufficient kind of person. She is said to be reclusive, although she insists that it's a \"myth\" that she has neither television nor telephone in her Dorset home. \"No, it's all modern,\" she laughs. \"I don't do email, though. I write letters.\" She has friends in the music business, and others in normal jobs - \"I need both\" - and her recent spell recording in New York was a sociable time. She says she's thinking of moving to San Francisco for a while - \"A friend has a spare room going\" - and maybe spending some time in Russia, too. There have been times when she has been single, and it felt right at the time, she says. \"I don't find it difficult being in my own company, and it doesn't worry me or upset me if I'm not in a relationship.\" And she says that was true even when she was at a low ebb emotionally. </p> <p>Her most high-profile relationship was around three years ago, with the musician Nick Cave. They are like peas in a pod - not only do they look uncannily alike, their music shares the same gotha-billy intensity. It has been said that he was rather more affected by their break-up than she, and that he wrote the moving and rather beautiful album, The Boatman's Call, about her after she ended the relationship. Harvey is not sure if it's all about her, however. \"I think it's about many different loves in his life.\" But he is someone who she \"respects enormously as a songwriter\". Does she ever feel sad that it's over? \"There's a time and a place for everything,\" she says in a measured tone. \"And I look back at that time with Nick as a wonderful time. I only have an enormous amount of respect for him and admiration and love, and it really was a great time in my life.\" </p> <p>She won't say if she's in a relationship at the moment, though some of the lyrics on her new album seem to indicate that there has been someone in her life. She says she's quite idealistic about love, and not very pragmatic when it comes to relationships. \"I'm much more instinctive, and dive in and get messed up.\" She laughs lightly. She's resolutely uncynical about men, though, and, while she doesn't \"gaze out of the window thinking of red roses\", she does think it is an amazing thing. \"I don't think that true, all-encompassing love for another comes along very often. It's a wonderful thing that should be treasured.\" As for the prospect of having a baby, she's sanguine. \"I tend to think that I'll take whatever comes my way, that whatever comes my way will happen or won't happen, and that's the way it'll be.\" </p> <p>She's so focused, so apparently sorted, that it's hard to imagine how she ever wasn't. But, clearly, it is something she has worked at. Being \"together\" has helped her write this album. \"I think this myth that, in order to be creative, you need to be angst-ridden and tormented and probably addicted to something is complete rubbish. I don't buy it at all. I've found being a more balanced person with more clarity has only enhanced my creativity, because I'm able to think straight and take information in and put it out. It makes good headlines - that's what people want, musicians drugging, sexing and drinking themselves to death - but it's a pop star/rock star myth, which is actually stupid.\" Not that she's averse to the odd drink. \"Certainly, it's a nice way to relax, and very enjoyable, but it definitely doesn't help my writing.\" And drugs? \"I've never got into drugs in a big way. I just don't need it.\" And as far as any moral viewpoint on the rights or wrongs of drug-taking, she's keeping schtum. As she does. </p> <p>When she saw Marianne Faithfull perform in New York last summer, Harvey was blown away. \"I've never seen someone with so much poise and grace and absolute control. She held the audience in the palm of her hand without even trying. She had so much charismatic strength, it was astounding.\" But then, only those who have lost control are likely to prize it so highly. So you can't really blame Harvey for her careful, circumspect approach. The rather impassive, controlled way about her probably enhances the PJ mystique and enigma, but, more important for her, it must help to preserve what you'd imagine must be a rather delicate equilibrium. She's an intense creature and, with her guard up and her boundaries firmly in place, she's protected - from herself as much as from anything else. She says she's stronger now than before, and \"I know what my limits are, and what I will and won't do\". There was a time when she was so low, she felt that she wanted to stay there. She describes the feeling as \"all-encompassing. You feel numb and, for a while, you want to feel like that, but then you realise that you don't any more, and by then it's too late, and you have to work really hard to pull yourself out of the mire.\" </p>",

      "bodyText": "It has never been music to potter around the house to, or to sip cocktails to, or to wake up to on a bright Sunday morning: Polly Jean Harvey's music has always been reserved for those long, dark nights of the soul - guaranteed to make us feel much worse, but somehow better at the same time. It has been her job to Feel Our Pain. Her songs have been bleak, angry, ghoulish. And Harvey herself, all paper-doll fragility, has always been the incarnation of angst, yowling her scary, disconcerting lyrics about unsettling things (voodoo, drowning, coffins, guns). She may never have possessed the distinctive grandeur of her most obvious predecessor, Patti Smith, but she blazed a trail of slow-burning sensuality, fury and eccentricity that helped bring women's rock out of the margins and into the charts in the late 90s. She was always a cut above the maudlin Morissettes and Phairs of this world. The only trouble was that, after a while, Harvey seemed to have so much more pain to feel than the rest of us could muster. Until recently, that is. There were signs of a slight breeziness on her last album, and there are tracks on the latest one that even have an optimism and lightness of touch previously unheard of from the supposed cauldron-stirring lady of darkness. In the flesh, though not exactly serene-looking, Harvey looks tanned and fit, as opposed to pallid and unwell, formerly her salient characteristics. She's tiny, but not spectrally thin, as she has been in the past, and she has strikingly large, long-lashed, hazel eyes and a wide, full mouth that goes slightly wonky when she speaks in her soft, West Country lilt. She has an intense, measured way about her. She's very still and composed, speaking confidently but also cautiously, articulating each sentence carefully. She says that her new album, Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea, is so named not so much because of the locations in which it was written (New York and Dorset), but because she has always liked the Jungian notion of \"the sea being the subconscious and the land the conscious\". The creative process draws from reality, she says, but also from the imagination, and is about returning to the imagination that we had as children. \"It seems to me that we spend a lot of our lives trying to get back to that simplicity, the vibrant imagination, we had as kids.\" She's not nostalgic about her childhood, though - \"I don't dwell too much on things that have gone. I try and live on a day-to-day basis\" - and won't go into enormous detail about her childhood, because she doesn't want to. But she does say that Dorset was a wonderful place to grow up, and \"alive with ideas and the space in which to create them\". Her mother, a sculptor, and her father, a stonemason, brought up their daughter to the sound of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker. The Harveys lived near a remote village with a population of 600, and their house, along with a few others, was set apart. There was no shop, just a post office and a telephone box. Polly used to hang around with a group of local boys. \"We had a gang in our offshoot village, and there were just boys. No girls to play with.\" Harvey began playing piano, violin and saxophone at the age of 11, and then taught herself to play the guitar at 18 - she'd been interested in writing since she was a child, and found that it was a good way to bring words and music together. Now 30, Harvey still lives for most of the time in Dorset, in a house by the sea. She's very close to her parents, and always plays them early demo tapes of her albums, because she respects their opinion and because they have a lot of musical knowledge and interest. \"It seems appropriate,\" she says. Having bohemian parents, her teenage rebellion took a rather different form than most. \"My rebellious stage was probably when I started buying Duran Duran records instead of listening to Captain Beefheart,\" she laughs, \"and my mum was, like, 'What on earth are you listening to?'\" She was 20 years old when she moved to London, and decided to defer a place to study sculpture at St Martin's art school in favour of signing a record deal. But the transfer from the countryside - and from the bosom of such a tightknit family - was a shock. In 1992, she released Dry. It was a jagged, raw album, drawing on swampy blues, with hints of Patti Smith, Captain Beefheart and grunge thrown in - the songs were angry and intense, the vocal style was a distinctive, banshee-like roar. Everything started happening at once, she says, and what should have been an exciting time, full of hope, turned into a nightmare - and the first of two nervous breakdowns.

I want to keep doing that as I want to do it, and not be swayed by outside influences.\" She seems a self-sufficient kind of person. She is said to be reclusive, although she insists that it's a \"myth\" that she has neither television nor telephone in her Dorset home. \"No, it's all modern,\" she laughs. \"I don't do email, though. I write letters.\" She has friends in the music business, and others in normal jobs - \"I need both\" - and her recent spell recording in New York was a sociable time. She says she's thinking of moving to San Francisco for a while - \"A friend has a spare room going\" - and maybe spending some time in Russia, too. There have been times when she has been single, and it felt right at the time, she says. \"I don't find it difficult being in my own company, and it doesn't worry me or upset me if I'm not in a relationship.\" And she says that was true even when she was at a low ebb emotionally. Her most high-profile relationship was around three years ago, with the musician Nick Cave. They are like peas in a pod - not only do they look uncannily alike, their music shares the same gotha-billy intensity. It has been said that he was rather more affected by their break-up than she, and that he wrote the moving and rather beautiful album, The Boatman's Call, about her after she ended the relationship. Harvey is not sure if it's all about her, however. \"I think it's about many different loves in his life.\" But he is someone who she \"respects enormously as a songwriter\". Does she ever feel sad that it's over? \"There's a time and a place for everything,\" she says in a measured tone. \"And I look back at that time with Nick as a wonderful time. I only have an enormous amount of respect for him and admiration and love, and it really was a great time in my life.\" She won't say if she's in a relationship at the moment, though some of the lyrics on her new album seem to indicate that there has been someone in her life. She says she's quite idealistic about love, and not very pragmatic when it comes to relationships. \"I'm much more instinctive, and dive in and get messed up.\" She laughs lightly. She's resolutely uncynical about men, though, and, while she doesn't \"gaze out of the window thinking of red roses\", she does think it is an amazing thing. \"I don't think that true, all-encompassing love for another comes along very often. It's a wonderful thing that should be treasured.\" As for the prospect of having a baby, she's sanguine. \"I tend to think that I'll take whatever comes my way, that whatever comes my way will happen or won't happen, and that's the way it'll be.\" She's so focused, so apparently sorted, that it's hard to imagine how she ever wasn't. But, clearly, it is something she has worked at. Being \"together\" has helped her write this album. \"I think this myth that, in order to be creative, you need to be angst-ridden and tormented and probably addicted to something is complete rubbish. I don't buy it at all. I've found being a more balanced person with more clarity has only enhanced my creativity, because I'm able to think straight and take information in and put it out. It makes good headlines - that's what people want, musicians drugging, sexing and drinking themselves to death - but it's a pop star/rock star myth, which is actually stupid.\" Not that she's averse to the odd drink. \"Certainly, it's a nice way to relax, and very enjoyable, but it definitely doesn't help my writing.\" And drugs? \"I've never got into drugs in a big way. I just don't need it.\" And as far as any moral viewpoint on the rights or wrongs of drug-taking, she's keeping schtum. As she does. When she saw Marianne Faithfull perform in New York last summer, Harvey was blown away. \"I've never seen someone with so much poise and grace and absolute control. She held the audience in the palm of her hand without even trying. She had so much charismatic strength, it was astounding.\" But then, only those who have lost control are likely to prize it so highly. So you can't really blame Harvey for her careful, circumspect approach. The rather impassive, controlled way about her probably enhances the PJ mystique and enigma, but, more important for her, it must help to preserve what you'd imagine must be a rather delicate equilibrium. She's an intense creature and, with her guard up and her boundaries firmly in place, she's protected - from herself as much as from anything else. She says she's stronger now than before, and \"I know what my limits are, and what I will and won't do\". There was a time when she was so low, she felt that she wanted to stay there. She describes the feeling as \"all-encompassing. You feel numb and, for a while, you want to feel like that, but then you realise that you don't any more, and by then it's too late, and you have to work really hard to pull yourself out of the mire.\"",

Combine beach with some sightseeing, shopping and wonderful eating in <strong> Bangkok</strong>. Bring back orchids to brighten the ensuing winter days. </p> <p>Malaysia's <strong> Penang</strong> combines plenty of good hotels and beaches with the stilt houses of <strong> Georgetown</strong>, the island of <strong> Langkawi</strong> is for those wanting sand, palm trees and total relaxation, as is the deliciously-secluded and up-market <strong> Pangkor Laut</strong>, where you may sleep in rooms constructed on piles over the sea. The country's east coast remains relatively undeveloped. </p> <p>Away from the main holiday beaches, <strong> Bali</strong> retains its culture of festivals and dancing. There are temples by the thousand and a stunning landscape whose terraced rice fields are dominated by volcanic mountains and irrigated by deeply channeled rivers that flow from their slopes. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br>Thailand's lowest rainfall is from December to February and average top temperatures well above 30C. Malaysia is similarly warm but can be a little wetter. Winter is not the best time for Bali. Rainfall is highest in December and January, and humidity, although commuted by sea breezes, is high. That said, sunshine is also prolonged and average maximum temperatures are around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sydney</strong> basking in Olympic congratulation, is the obvious jumping-off point - all glinting water and splendid, eclectic eating. Climb the superstructure of the Harbour Bridge, linger in the botanical gardens, visit the excellent Art Gallery of New South Wales. Shoe-horn in enough time for the beaches, of which there are plenty. (Locals say Whale Beach, to the north, is best.) </p> <p>Take to the water in boat-mad <strong> Perth</strong>, barbie by the Yarra in <strong> Melbourne</strong>. <strong> Adelaide</strong> has more outside restaurants than you can count. <strong> Tasmania</strong> would be a good option, with its ravishing beaches and great hiking trails, such as that recently opened on the Bay of Fires. Avoid the period around Christmas, when air fares soar. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> Not much to choose between December and January, when temperatures in Sydney are between the high teens and mid 20s and humidity moderate - but rainfall tends to increase after that. Between December and March, it rains stair-rods in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Hottest days in Perth are around three degrees warmer than in Sydney. Rainfall is lowest in December but negligible from November to March and humidity is slight. Tasmania is cooler, with top temperatures hovering around the 20C mark between November and March, although it is usually drier than Sydney. </p> <p><strong>Bahamas</strong> </p> <p> Strangely under-patronised by the British. <strong> Nassau</strong> has fine beaches, slick hotels and gambling, but the out islands are delightful, with little or no development, sparse population, a tempo so slow as to be near imperceptible and stretches of deserted sand. Including the smaller cays, there are a total of 700, among them the <strong> Abacos</strong>, <strong> Exumas</strong> and <strong> San Salvador</strong>, where Columbus made his first landfall. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> December. </p> <p><strong>Bermuda</strong></p> <p> Although less than 600 miles from New York, the main island and its neighbours remain warm even in mid-winter. Sublime beaches, great snorkeling and scuba diving. Echoes of empire -cricket is played, and judges wear white wigs. </p> <p>The capital, <strong> Hamilton</strong>, has buildings of pastel-coloured elegance; indeed, Mark Twain once wrote that he'd rather stay in Bermuda than go to heaven. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> the weather is probably best after mid-December but then remains pretty consistent until spring, with average maximum temperatures around 20C. </p> <p> <strong>Canaries</strong></p> <p> Unquestionably Britain's most popular winter sunshine destination, but if you are looking for somewhere completely different, forget it - on Tenerife's <strong>Playa de las Americas</strong>, full English breakfast is readily available, and Old Speckled Hen and Warsteiner lager are on tap. And there would have been no problem finding a TV on which to watch England's latest, woeful World Cup performance. </p> <p>However, there are escape routes: the interior of <strong> Tenerife</strong>, dominated by Mount Teide, is spectacularly beautiful. It offers excellent hiking, as does the Macizo, or massif, on the north-west of the island where you can follow Inca-like trails cut by the Guanche people, who are believed to have migrated here from North Africa some 2,000 years ago. Gran Canaria also has wonderful, lush scenery away from its main resort areas. And there are less brash resorts, such as Tenerife's Puerto de la Cruz, and Puerto del Carmen and Playa Blanca on the volcanic island of <strong> Lanzarote</strong>. </p> <p>The nightlife on <strong> Fuerteventura</strong> is fairly low key, too. Unlike Lanzarote, it has white-sand beaches. While rain is not uncommon in winter, temperatures are pleasant. Those determined to swim in the sea should remember that this is the coast of the Atlantic. However conditions for windsurfing can be excellent. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong> February and March. Average maximum temperatures are in the low 20s and total rainfall is about 25mm. </p> <p><strong>Caribbean</strong> </p> <p> Choose your island carefully because they vary greatly. <strong> Jamaica </strong> is probably the most fun and arguably the most beautiful. When you are bored by the beaches, do the tourist thing and slither up Dunn's River Falls, take a raft trip down the Rio Grande, look for crocodiles up the Black River and on no account miss No\u00ebl Coward's former home, Firefly. </p> <p><strong> Cuba</strong>, a combination of beach, history, politics and culture, runs Jamaica close. <strong> St Lucia</strong> and <strong> Grenada</strong> are also scenically lovely, <strong> Antigua</strong> less so but with an abundance of beaches. In <strong> Barbados</strong>, the sea shifts softly from azure to emerald green along west coast coral beaches of fine white sand while Atlantic surf thunders on its eastern shores. </p> <p>The US and British Virgin Islands are also sharply different. <strong> St Thomas</strong> in the USVI is a major port of call for cruise ships and does a roaring trade in duty free, the BVI's <strong> Tortola</strong> and <strong> Virgin Gorda</strong>, some of whose beaches are accessible only by boat, are much sleepier. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> like their characters, island climates vary - although not so sharply. February and March tend to be the driest with average rainfall between around 25mm and 40mm, humidity at its kindest and average maximum temperatures either in the high 20s or around the 30C mark. </p> <p><strong>Florida</strong> </p> <p> Take a canoe down the Wekiva River, only a few miles from downtown <strong> Orlando</strong> and less than an hour's drive from <strong> Walt Disney World</strong>, and you'll feel about as close to the theme parks as an astronaut in orbit. Turtles slide into the water from tree roots, blue heron stalk fish - but read Carl Hiaasen's acid eco-novel, Sick Puppy, for a reminder of how fragile it all is. Even if Disney and <strong> Universal Studios</strong> are not for you, <strong> the Kennedy Space Centre</strong> at Cape Canaveral is worth a look, if only to see just how cumbersome computer equipment was when mankind took that giant step. Your kids now have more sophisticated gear. </p> <p>Beaches, on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, are too numerous to mention. <strong> Miami</strong>'s were once thought of as the Costa Geriatrica but South Beach is now high art-deco chic. Go to the <strong> Everglades</strong>, drive down the Keys to Ernest Hemingway's wonderfully atmospheric house at <strong> Key West</strong>, eat Cuban and Cajun and great seafood - from crab cakes to grouper. <strong> Sanibel Island</strong>, on the Gulf of Mexico, is a wonderful retreat. </p> <p><strong> Best month to go:</strong><br> December is probably favourite, with minimum temperatures in the high teens (centigrade), maximum in the mid 20s, an average of around 50mm or rain and manageable humidity. </p> <p><strong>The Gambia</strong> </p> <p> Budget packages, a shortish flight and no time difference have made it an introduction to Africa for generations of holidaymakers. Surrounded on three sides by Senegal, it runs like a wedge inland along its eponymous river and is, give or take a few metres, entirely flat. Fine, long, shell strewn beaches, mangrove creeks, rich bird life. Crocodiles, birds and a large variety of monkeys at Abuko Nature Reserve. Be sure to take precautions against malaria. </p> <p><strong> Best months to go:</strong><br> December - March. Low rainfall. Average maximum temperatures around 30C but more likely in the mid to high 20s during the day. </p> <p><strong>Goa</strong> </p> <p> There has been much argument about the impact of tourism on culture and the environment and the extent to which its economic benefits are trickling down to all levels of society. That said, the former Portuguese colony has avoided the curse of the high-rise hotel and has superb beaches along its 65 miles or so of India's Arabian Sea coastline. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> December - March. Low rainfall, humidity bearable in comparison with summer. Average maximum temperatures around the 30C mark. </p> <p><strong>The Gulf</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Dubai</strong> has recently opened a clutch of swish new hotels, among them the spectacular Jumeirah Beach. Fine swimming, watersports, bargain shopping and desert diversions. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> January is usually the driest month in Eilat, with maximum average temperatures creeping above 20C. If anything, marginally warmer in the Egyptian resorts. January and February are ideal in Dubai, with highest average temperatures in the low to mid 20s and rain unlikely. </p> <p><strong>Kenya</strong> </p> <p> Combine an Indian Ocean beach holiday with a safari in the <strong> Tsavo National Park</strong>, on the border with Tanzania. The main beaches, of white coral sand and protected by reefs from the open sea, are to the south of the old trading port of Mombasa. Snorkeling and scuba diving can be excellent. To the north are more beaches at Watamu and at Malindi, where the reef is a marine National Park. </p> <p><strong> Best months to go</strong><br> January and February have the lowest rainfall, with average temperatures around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Madeira</strong> </p> <p> With its steeply terraced fields, vineyards and fishing villages, it is altogether quieter and more sedate than the likes of Tenerife. That is largely because of the island's rugged coastline and limited beaches. </p> <p>Maderia is best recommended to those in search of a little gentle exploration and to walkers who can follow the network of irrigation channels, known as levadas. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> Visitors in January tend to suffer the least winter rainfall, and maximum average temperatures are around 20C. </p> <p><strong>Mauritius</strong> </p> <p> Many argue its magnificent white-sand beaches, some sheltered, some with surf, are better than those of the Caribbean. Mainly for those seeking unadulterated R&amp;R, although the capital, Port Louis, is worth a quick visit. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> tropical storms are likely in winter, but average maximum temperatures range from the high 20s to around 30C. </p> <p><strong>Mexico</strong> </p> <p> For a pure beach holiday, go for <strong> Puerto Vallarta</strong> on the Pacific Coast. <strong> Canc\u00fan</strong> has its drawbacks: it is little more than a strip of beachfront hotels in all manner of architectural styles. It may be better to stay on the nearby island of <strong> Cozumel</strong>, which has good snorkeling. But both are a springboard for the ancient Mayan sites of <strong> Tulum</strong> and the stupendous <strong> Chichen Itza</strong> with its 1,200-year-old pyramid of El Castillo. </p> <p> <strong> Best months to go: </strong><br> in Cancun, rainfall is lowest December - March and average temperatures are in the very high 20s or around 30C. On the Pacific coast there is negligible rain, and average temperatures range from a minimum of about 23C to a maximum of roughly 32C. </p> <p><strong>Middle East</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Eilat</strong>, Israel's Red Sea port, is functional rather than idyllic, but new five-star hotels have opened and there is less building work than there once was. It offers great coral reef snorkeling and scuba diving. Side excursions are possible to Petra, in Jordan, and to the Timna National Park. </p> <p>Superb diving to be found on the Egyptian Red Sea coasts, too - at <strong> Sharm El Sheikh</strong>, a good jumping-off point for St Catherine's Monastery, and at the east coast resort of <strong> Hurghada</strong>. </p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Cape Town</strong> is the best bet. Be prepared for intense beauty soured by a slew of shanty towns. For sweepingcoastal views the energetic may decide to make an assault on Table Mountain; the sedentary can ride the cable car. The jazz scene remains vibrant. The Cape, which has produced musicians such as Abdullah Ibrahim, has a sound of its own. See fur seals at Hout Bay, eland and baboon in the Cape Nature Reserve. </p> <p><strong> Stellenbosch</strong> and the surrounding vineyard country has elegant Cape Dutch architecture and estates where you can lunch and taste wines. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> February. Average minimum daily temperature in the mid teens, maximum mid 20s, 16C, rainfall under 8mm. </p> <p><strong>South America</strong> </p> <p> Air fares remain at historic lows. It is possible, this winter, to fly to <strong> Rio de Janeiro</strong> for \u00a3329 or to the Chilean capital, <strong> Santiago</strong>, for \u00a3415. All human life is there on Rio's beaches. </p> <p> <strong> Best month to go: </strong><br> December for Rio. Average daily temperature is around 20C minimum - 26C maximum, rainfall around 100mm - but that's less than in January, February or March. Fairly sticky. </p>",

Superb diving to be found on the Egyptian Red Sea coasts, too - at Sharm El Sheikh, a good jumping-off point for St Catherine's Monastery, and at the east coast resort of Hurghada. South Africa Cape Town is the best bet. Be prepared for intense beauty soured by a slew of shanty towns. For sweepingcoastal views the energetic may decide to make an assault on Table Mountain; the sedentary can ride the cable car. The jazz scene remains vibrant. The Cape, which has produced musicians such as Abdullah Ibrahim, has a sound of its own. See fur seals at Hout Bay, eland and baboon in the Cape Nature Reserve. Stellenbosch and the surrounding vineyard country has elegant Cape Dutch architecture and estates where you can lunch and taste wines. Best month to go: February. Average minimum daily temperature in the mid teens, maximum mid 20s, 16C, rainfall under 8mm. South America Air fares remain at historic lows. It is possible, this winter, to fly to Rio de Janeiro for \u00a3329 or to the Chilean capital, Santiago, for \u00a3415. All human life is there on Rio's beaches. Best month to go: December for Rio. Average daily temperature is around 20C minimum - 26C maximum, rainfall around 100mm - but that's less than in January, February or March. Fairly sticky.",

It produces oil from fields in the south, processes natural gas and grows sugar cane. And, precisely because it is not a tourist centre, Trinidad is one of the most interesting holiday destinations in the region. </p> <p>It is also possibly the most ethnically-mixed island in the region - split almost 50-50 between East Indian and Afro-Caribbean Trinidadians together with a relatively small number of Europeans and Chinese. The result is the most diverse cuisine and music: besides soca, you can find parang, a strange Indo-Caribbean Christmas mix. </p> <p>It is outside the capital, Port of Spain, that Trinidad blossoms. Head west to the peninsula of Chaguaramas, formerly a US military base and now a range of hills surrounded by sandy bays. Among the marinas at the southern end, you will find the Crews Inn - it is expensive by Trinidadian standards but it produces an excellent Sunday buffet lunch for $10 a head. </p> <p>The former military hangars have been turned to good use - one represents a celebration of the work of Trinidad's most famous carnival designer, Peter Minshall. Another houses a museum recounting the role played by Trinidadians in the first world war. </p> <p>The road north leads to the Northern Range of mountains, passing Edith Falls waterfall and heading up to Macqueripe Bay, a former hang-out of Hollywood stars in the 1930s and 40s and now an enclosed and mellow little beach where local people come to watch the sunset. If you want it, this is beach Trinidad. Just a few miles along the coast is the island's biggest resort beach, Maracas Bay, along with other beaches with names such as Blanchisseuse and Salybia Bay. But this is not Barbados: the beaches are often empty. </p> <p>If you want something wilder, head south past the town of Sangre Grande (pronounced \"Sandy Grandy\") and down towards Manzanilla. Twenty years ago, this was the beach to be seen at after carnival, but now former holiday homes crumble beneath the coconut palms that line the 20km road east to Mayaro. </p> <p>The beach stretches into the distance in a gentle curve. On one side is the Nariva swamp, an unspoilt and relatively tourist-free nature reserve where you can see red howler monkeys swing from the trees while anaconda and manatee live among the streams. Amid this unspoilt natural beauty, strange and uniquely Trinidadian creatures called Buffalypso (a mix between a cow and a water buffalo) graze gently. A young boy herds the animals into a lake to cool down while white egrets peck mosquitoes from their backs. </p> <p>From Mayaro, take the pot-holed and windy road to Trinidad's second city, San Fernando. It's a pretty but industrial town dominated by its 200m-high \"hill\", an enormous rock face looming from the middle of the city, half hacked off by quarrying before it was preserved. Further east is Trinidad's Texas. The oil boom of the 1970s saved Trinidad from domination by the tourist industry, but it also meant parts of the island were fenced off by the industry. </p> <p>Not, however, Trinidad's natural phenomenon, the pitch lake at La Brea. It's essentially a mass of dark oozing pitch, constantly replenished. Sir Francis Drake caulked his ships here, and guides queue up aggressively outside. </p> <p>The Solomon Hochoy highway runs north back up the island. Cars in all states of disrepair imitate wacky races at high speeds past the roti restaurants where you can eat a huge meal for US$5. After lunch, the Caroni swamp offers an interesting afternoon. </p> <p>A small local operator packs out a motor boat which floats gently up the swamp, past a boa in a tree here, an iguana there. \"This is a guided tour, isn't it?\" demands one Trinidadian of the silent pilot. \"Well start guiding, then.\" Reluctantly and monosyllabically, he shouts out the names of creatures and trees. \"Tree boa\", \"Iguana\", \"tree crab\". </p> <p>South of Caroni is the Waterloo temple, another of the island's beautifully odd locations. It was built by an Indian indentured labourer, Sewdass Sadhu, who single-handedly reclaimed land from the sea over 25 years after his first temple was demolished by the colonial authorities. Sewdass used concrete-filled barrels to build the foundations. </p> <p>The pointed roof juts out over the water along a long pier, while faded puja flags flutter in the wind. On land, funeral pyres burn brightly, sending dark smoke into the sky. Standing there, you could be on the banks of the Ganges, but instead of traditional Hindu prayers, the strains of Jim Reeves fill the air.

Standing there, you could be on the banks of the Ganges, but instead of traditional Hindu prayers, the strains of Jim Reeves fill the air. Beautiful and bizarre.

This is the legendary spot where St Columba, or Colum Cille, landed on Iona in 563 AD, after fleeing from his native Ireland. </p> <p>He landed in his skin- covered coracle on the stony beach known as Port a' Churaich, or the Port of the Coracle, near the south-eastern tip of the island. </p> <p>Once ashore, he climbed to the nearest high point above the beach, the heather-covered hill known as Carn Cul ri Eirinn - the Cairn of the Back to Ireland - and cast his eyes westwards to see if he could still see his homeland.

      "body": "<p>Every morning the only signs of life on the beach are the footprints of birds and the new crab trails that criss-cross the sand like miniature motorbike tyre tracks. From your bed to the sea, it's 20 paces across soft white sand into the pale turquoise of the Indian Ocean, warm as a baby's bath and so clear you can see every ripple of the sandbars underfoot. Overhead, the sky is the deepest blue with occasional puffs of small white clouds. It will stay like that all day every day if you have steered clear of the monsoon months of May and June. </p> <p>The Maldives are more than 1,000 small coral islands, 600kms south west of Sri Lanka stretching in clusters across the equator over a distance 750km long and 118km wide. Only 202 of them are inhabited by the Maldives 250,000 citizens. Seventy-four others have been turned into resort islands devoted to pretending that Robinson Crusoe had an easy life. To promote this illusion, virtually all supplies, including the building materials and equipment must be flown in from Europe, the Gulf, Thailand and India. </p> <p>The Maldivians, devout muslims since the 12th century, have kept a strict distance from their visitors. Tourists are only allowed on inhabited islands for brief visits. They glimpse a world unchanged for centuries where the mosque rules and women wear long skirts and a veils. There are no cars, no television, no hotels or restaurants. The tourists are soon returned to their fantasy worlds. </p> <p>The tourist industry, which with fishing is the backbone of the country's economy, is a masterpiece of logistics that daily disperses large numbers of tourists by speedboat, sea plane or helicopter to islands where a few years ago there was precisely nothing except mangroves, banyans and coconut trees ringed by coral reefs. But as you flyover the islands today, the hotels are mainly invisible, never reaching above tree level, although some have rooms built on stilts out over the water. </p> <p>What you see from the plane is an extraordinary tapestry of blues: dark like a tuareg's robe, but sprinkled with green/blue patches shading to the palest turquoise where the coral reef is near the surface, often in a circle surrounding an island. </p> <p>Reversing the image, you can imagine the Maldives as a vast volcanic mountain range 5,000m high and submerged beneath the Indian Ocean except for the coral peaks visible today. The range stretches from the Lakshadweep Islands near India to the Chagos Islands south of the Equator (soon, courtesy of the British courts, to be repopulated by its original inhabitants removed by Britain 30 years ago to allow an American air base to be built at Diego Garcia). </p> <p>The Maldives are in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's flattest country, and no island is more than 2.4m above sea level. Three years ago, when El Ni\u00f1o raised the sea temperature around the Maldives by two degrees, to 30C, and much of the coral reefs died, the word was, \"go to the Maldives quick if you want to see it before global warming swamps the islands\". </p> <p>But now, according to the islanders, the panic is over. The water temperature has dropped, and in the past six months the reef in some places has tripled in size. </p> <p>Kunfunadhoo, on which our hotel, Soneva Fushi, is situated, is in the far north of the Maldives, half an hour by sea plane from the capital and main airport at Male. When the plane bumps down on the ocean, it is hard to imagine a more remote scene - the sea touches the horizon on every side. From the island, a boat chugs out to meet the plane. </p> <p>The handful of people arriving with you on the seaplane will be led away down sandy, heavily-shaded paths into the woods, mostly never to be seen again. Soneva Fushi is the ultimate in hotels, offering complete privacy, no chintz sofas, and no visible guests. Each family has a small house hidden in huge trees and right by the beach. There are Chinese bicycles outside your house, and you can bike by the light of a dim dynamo and the moon through the trees to the restaurant. </p> <p>Even in the restaurant in the evening, you have only a blurry glimpse of other guests because the lighting is by candlelight and the tables are wide apart under trees leading to the sea. The waiters appear out of the darkness in long white skirts and tops. </p> <p>But if the restaurant is too public, you can always have a barbecue of lobster and tuna brought on to the beach in front of your house. </p> <p>At night on the beach and in the forest, the smell of the mangrove's white star flowers is intoxicating, somewhere between the gardenia hedges of the American south and English jasmine bushes. When you come back from dinner, a white mosquito net is round the bed and the sheet and pillow have been covered with scarlet and pink bougainvillaea and white frangipani flowers. </p> <p>This is not a world pene trated by CNN, but instead the perfect atmosphere for watching the old movies provided with your video. There is Pride and Prejudice with Laurence Olivier, Citizen Kane, Some Like it Hot, and enough Peter Sellers to last you through a monsoon. </p> <p>Your house boasts a bathroom partly open to the sky so you can shower looking at the stars, and it is designed with plantation teak from Indonesia in Scandinavian style which encourages you to linger. Or you can lie on the huge pale linen sofa in the veranda, watching the tide lap over the sand in the moonlight. </p> <p>You could read a book a day lying on that sofa, or on the big wooden day-beds under the coconut palm in the garden, or the hammock slung from two coconut trees over the water. But you might also find yourself losing the plot because of the distraction of the constant murmur of the sea and the rustle of the trees. There's also the clicking of the geckos and the cawing of the giant crows to listen to, and the insistent call from the mosque twice a day. </p> <p>Overhead, processions of fairy terns, a speciality of the Indian Ocean, swoop down with their long white tails which seem almost too heavy for them to lift. Then there are the flying foxes, whose little brown furry faces and enormous black wings can be seen day and night. Be warned: they like to dive down for a closer look at what's in the hammock at any moment of the day. </p> <p>For 12 hours a day, the light is so clear and brilliant that every detail imprints itself on your retina; every line stands out on the pale grey driftwood on the beach, or on the giant elephant-ear leaves in the forest, or the shadows of the palm fronds across the sand. At midday in the forest arrows of sunlight burn through the trees, but pools of semi-darkness still predominate. </p> <p>From the magic of the rustling dark forest there could not be a greater contrast with the silence and brilliance of life under water for the snorkler. On the reef itself, or in the deep ocean where the reef falls suddenly away, you see colours as vivid and otherworldly as the names: black, white and yellow stripes of moorish idols, turquoise and green of parrot fish, scarlet squirrel fish, eels as long as you are, trumpet fish, butterfly fish, stingrays and manta rays. </p> <p>If you are lucky, you can swim with fat turtles or dolphins, which often come to the edge of the reef. Turtles are endangered, and the Maldives have strict rules about not buying tortoishell jewellery or ornaments. </p> <p>One of the island's oddities is the tame rabbit population. A pregnant rabbit once arrived with a guest, and many rabbit generations later they are everywhere, the lack of predators allowing them to multiply unhindered. They are naturally curious, too, sitting up on their hind legs by the dinner table, or lolloping along by your bicycle. </p> <p>A third of the island's guests are Asian, mainly Japanese and Australian, and part of the secret of the virtually empty beaches is that for many of them the lure of the Maldives is its deep-sea fishing and diving. They disappear on boats for long expeditions, leaving the island seemingly empty of people all day. Others disappear into the spa where Swedish and Thai massage, and every kind of beauty treatment await the sybarites. </p> <p>Behind the trees off the forest paths are huge mechanical workshops that keep the island self-sufficient in desalinated water. Much of the water is used on a vegetable garden which provides fresh salads, but earth had to be shipped in from India to make it viable. A carpentry workshop nearby makes chests, chairs, and towel-rails in bamboo and local woods. Old telegraph poles and railway sleepers have been brought from Australia, Britain, and Indonesia to make some of the heavier furniture such as the bar tables. </p> <p>Robinson Crusoe did not have 250 staff from 16 nationalities working behind the scenes for his comfort and pleasure. What he did have every day, if he wasn't too busy with the business on surviving, was the delight of dusk. Darkness falls in minutes with the abruptness of the tropics, stripping the blues from the water, turning the white sand grey, making the forest even more seductive and mysterious. These are the moments for the hammock and for dreaming you will never leave.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every morning the only signs of life on the beach are the footprints of birds and the new crab trails that criss-cross the sand like miniature motorbike tyre tracks. From your bed to the sea, it's 20 paces across soft white sand into the pale turquoise of the Indian Ocean, warm as a baby's bath and so clear you can see every ripple of the sandbars underfoot. Overhead, the sky is the deepest blue with occasional puffs of small white clouds. It will stay like that all day every day if you have steered clear of the monsoon months of May and June. The Maldives are more than 1,000 small coral islands, 600kms south west of Sri Lanka stretching in clusters across the equator over a distance 750km long and 118km wide. Only 202 of them are inhabited by the Maldives 250,000 citizens. Seventy-four others have been turned into resort islands devoted to pretending that Robinson Crusoe had an easy life. To promote this illusion, virtually all supplies, including the building materials and equipment must be flown in from Europe, the Gulf, Thailand and India. The Maldivians, devout muslims since the 12th century, have kept a strict distance from their visitors. Tourists are only allowed on inhabited islands for brief visits. They glimpse a world unchanged for centuries where the mosque rules and women wear long skirts and a veils. There are no cars, no television, no hotels or restaurants. The tourists are soon returned to their fantasy worlds. The tourist industry, which with fishing is the backbone of the country's economy, is a masterpiece of logistics that daily disperses large numbers of tourists by speedboat, sea plane or helicopter to islands where a few years ago there was precisely nothing except mangroves, banyans and coconut trees ringed by coral reefs. But as you flyover the islands today, the hotels are mainly invisible, never reaching above tree level, although some have rooms built on stilts out over the water. What you see from the plane is an extraordinary tapestry of blues: dark like a tuareg's robe, but sprinkled with green/blue patches shading to the palest turquoise where the coral reef is near the surface, often in a circle surrounding an island. Reversing the image, you can imagine the Maldives as a vast volcanic mountain range 5,000m high and submerged beneath the Indian Ocean except for the coral peaks visible today. The range stretches from the Lakshadweep Islands near India to the Chagos Islands south of the Equator (soon, courtesy of the British courts, to be repopulated by its original inhabitants removed by Britain 30 years ago to allow an American air base to be built at Diego Garcia). The Maldives are in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's flattest country, and no island is more than 2.4m above sea level. Three years ago, when El Ni\u00f1o raised the sea temperature around the Maldives by two degrees, to 30C, and much of the coral reefs died, the word was, \"go to the Maldives quick if you want to see it before global warming swamps the islands\". But now, according to the islanders, the panic is over. The water temperature has dropped, and in the past six months the reef in some places has tripled in size. Kunfunadhoo, on which our hotel, Soneva Fushi, is situated, is in the far north of the Maldives, half an hour by sea plane from the capital and main airport at Male. When the plane bumps down on the ocean, it is hard to imagine a more remote scene - the sea touches the horizon on every side. From the island, a boat chugs out to meet the plane. The handful of people arriving with you on the seaplane will be led away down sandy, heavily-shaded paths into the woods, mostly never to be seen again. Soneva Fushi is the ultimate in hotels, offering complete privacy, no chintz sofas, and no visible guests. Each family has a small house hidden in huge trees and right by the beach. There are Chinese bicycles outside your house, and you can bike by the light of a dim dynamo and the moon through the trees to the restaurant. Even in the restaurant in the evening, you have only a blurry glimpse of other guests because the lighting is by candlelight and the tables are wide apart under trees leading to the sea. The waiters appear out of the darkness in long white skirts and tops. But if the restaurant is too public, you can always have a barbecue of lobster and tuna brought on to the beach in front of your house. At night on the beach and in the forest, the smell of the mangrove's white star flowers is intoxicating, somewhere between the gardenia hedges of the American south and English jasmine bushes. When you come back from dinner, a white mosquito net is round the bed and the sheet and pillow have been covered with scarlet and pink bougainvillaea and white frangipani flowers. This is not a world pene trated by CNN, but instead the perfect atmosphere for watching the old movies provided with your video. There is Pride and Prejudice with Laurence Olivier, Citizen Kane, Some Like it Hot, and enough Peter Sellers to last you through a monsoon. Your house boasts a bathroom partly open to the sky so you can shower looking at the stars, and it is designed with plantation teak from Indonesia in Scandinavian style which encourages you to linger. Or you can lie on the huge pale linen sofa in the veranda, watching the tide lap over the sand in the moonlight. You could read a book a day lying on that sofa, or on the big wooden day-beds under the coconut palm in the garden, or the hammock slung from two coconut trees over the water. But you might also find yourself losing the plot because of the distraction of the constant murmur of the sea and the rustle of the trees. There's also the clicking of the geckos and the cawing of the giant crows to listen to, and the insistent call from the mosque twice a day. Overhead, processions of fairy terns, a speciality of the Indian Ocean, swoop down with their long white tails which seem almost too heavy for them to lift. Then there are the flying foxes, whose little brown furry faces and enormous black wings can be seen day and night. Be warned: they like to dive down for a closer look at what's in the hammock at any moment of the day. For 12 hours a day, the light is so clear and brilliant that every detail imprints itself on your retina; every line stands out on the pale grey driftwood on the beach, or on the giant elephant-ear leaves in the forest, or the shadows of the palm fronds across the sand. At midday in the forest arrows of sunlight burn through the trees, but pools of semi-darkness still predominate. From the magic of the rustling dark forest there could not be a greater contrast with the silence and brilliance of life under water for the snorkler. On the reef itself, or in the deep ocean where the reef falls suddenly away, you see colours as vivid and otherworldly as the names: black, white and yellow stripes of moorish idols, turquoise and green of parrot fish, scarlet squirrel fish, eels as long as you are, trumpet fish, butterfly fish, stingrays and manta rays. If you are lucky, you can swim with fat turtles or dolphins, which often come to the edge of the reef. Turtles are endangered, and the Maldives have strict rules about not buying tortoishell jewellery or ornaments. One of the island's oddities is the tame rabbit population. A pregnant rabbit once arrived with a guest, and many rabbit generations later they are everywhere, the lack of predators allowing them to multiply unhindered. They are naturally curious, too, sitting up on their hind legs by the dinner table, or lolloping along by your bicycle. A third of the island's guests are Asian, mainly Japanese and Australian, and part of the secret of the virtually empty beaches is that for many of them the lure of the Maldives is its deep-sea fishing and diving. They disappear on boats for long expeditions, leaving the island seemingly empty of people all day. Others disappear into the spa where Swedish and Thai massage, and every kind of beauty treatment await the sybarites. Behind the trees off the forest paths are huge mechanical workshops that keep the island self-sufficient in desalinated water. Much of the water is used on a vegetable garden which provides fresh salads, but earth had to be shipped in from India to make it viable. A carpentry workshop nearby makes chests, chairs, and towel-rails in bamboo and local woods. Old telegraph poles and railway sleepers have been brought from Australia, Britain, and Indonesia to make some of the heavier furniture such as the bar tables. Robinson Crusoe did not have 250 staff from 16 nationalities working behind the scenes for his comfort and pleasure. What he did have every day, if he wasn't too busy with the business on surviving, was the delight of dusk. Darkness falls in minutes with the abruptness of the tropics, stripping the blues from the water, turning the white sand grey, making the forest even more seductive and mysterious. These are the moments for the hammock and for dreaming you will never leave.",

The rest of the press followed suit. The upshot was that the cabinet duly appeared as a sleazy, bickering, money-grabbing bunch of prima donnas. This coverage, says Robinson, will help not only the prime minister and Mandelson, but contribute to the government's stability and improve its standing in the eyes of the public. Bridges had to be built, so the Labour MP and former minister thought he would knock some down.</p> <p>\"There may be an initial reaction that will say: 'We could have done without that,' \" says Robinson. \"But I think the more mature reflection will be: 'Yes, there was a very important point Geoffrey was trying to make there, and I think we should tackle it.' \"</p> <p>If this sounds disingenuous it is because it is. It seems as though Robinson, the 62-year-old former paymaster general whose \u00a3373,000 loan to Mandelson forced both of them to resign in December 1998, just cannot help it. Every time he has opened his mouth this week in order to sound sincere, something ludicrously insincere pops out. If he says he has \"nothing but the greatest respect for Peter Mandelson\" you know he is about to trash him. When he writes: \"The public hates to see politicians squabbling and punishes divided governments,\" you know he is about to squabble in a way that will divide the government.</p> <p>He says he has not been surprised at the anti-Labour reception the book has got, but will be surprised if Labour does not benefit. \"It was never intended to be a political version of a kiss and tell,\" he says. \"The serious points I've concentrated on only after considerable and careful thought. I wanted it to be constructive, I wanted it to contribute to making the government more effective and I believe that over time it will have that impact.\"</p> <p>The serious and constructive points revealed in the Mail's serialisation include the following: Robinson was \"miffed\" that he had not been invited to Mandelson's housewarming party Mandelson, not him, raised the issue of a loan for his house in Notting Hill at a dinner party and Mandelson \"remains a destabilising influence between the prime minister and his chancellor\". Now Mandelson is back in government, as a minister, while Robinson remains an outcast.</p> <p>To call this revenge would be to make far too great a claim for it. By his own admission he has far more damaging material in the way of personal letters, that he says he will not release. So this is pique at its pettiest. The politics of the playground, only with far bigger stakes. It is an attempt at political assassination by biography which may well backfire. For it bears the hallmarks of the injured van ity of an insider who is now out the conflicted allegiances of a man who has status but craves respect the disingenuousness of a multimillionaire who thinks money makes no difference. If this is serious, you wonder what he would call trivial if it is constructive, you wonder what he would call damaging.</p> <p>It is a contradiction inherent in the very project he himself embarked on - to settle a score in print without appearing bitter in person. \"The two main aims of what I wanted to achieve are first to counteract the impression of me that I was the sort of person who would use money to promote his own career, curry influence even to obtain a job, which seemed to be a certain element of this from the press attacks that came into this equation. I hope people can see a different person from the one they might have imagined. The second, after considerable reflecton, to raise the issue of Mandelson's role in government. From the beginning I realised how talented he is. But he must stop briefing against colleagues.\"</p> <p>The Park Room, at the Grosvenor House hotel, is an unlikely setting for the outpourings of a victim. Its windows look straight out on to Hyde Park, the furniture is plush and a cup of tea costs more than \u00a34. Upstairs single rooms go from \u00a3267 a night. This is where Geoffrey Robinson stays when he is in London. From the eighth floor, with a glorious view of Park Lane, he sits like a benevolent Master of the Universe - sipping champagne while pontificating on the plight of the poor. It is here that he used to hold \"tax and pasta parties\" with Gordon Brown and his advisers, Charlie Whelan and Ed Balls, while elaborating Labour's economic strategy for the 1997 election.</p> <p>Robinson arrives with a limp he incurred in the gym. His friendliness often threatens to break out into charm but is kept in check by his lack of candour. Just when he appears affable, a straight question: \"What should Blair do if Mandelson fails to become a team player?\" meets an evasive answer: \"I don't want to get into that\" and the bonhomie evaporates. Despite many accounts to the contrary, he maintains that Blair did not ask him to sell the New Statesman to Robert Harris and that nobody from Blair's team asked him not to publish his book.</p> <p>His penthouse is just one of many homes. Ask him how many and he will not, or cannot, give a straight answer. \"It depends how you count them I suppose. We have a little hamlet in Italy which has several buildings on it and a house here in the country. Those are our main two residences,\" he says. And the one in Cannes? \"Yes, we do have one flat in Cannes.\" So there is the Orchards, the Lutyens mansion in Godalming, Surrey the Tuscan villa and the bolthole on the Riviera that slipped his mind. The one place he does not have a home is in his own constituency of Coventry North West.</p> <p>Robinson came by this wealth honestly, if, at times, mysteriously. While running British Leyland's Italian car division in Milan he befriended Joska Bourgeois, a wealthy, flamboyant woman who held the Belgian Jaguar franchise. He married a Maltese-born opera singer, Marie Elena, and would later become the chief executive of Jaguar before going on to run his own business. His close relationship with Bourgeois continued. She lent him \u00a35,000 to start a small company called Transfer Technology, later renamed Transtech. By the time he became a treasury minister it was worth pounds 30m. When Bourgeois died in 1994, she left him pounds 9m and had already set up an offshore trust fund for his family in Guernsey called Orion. While there is no shortage of rumours about the reson for her generosity, nobody knows for sure and Robinson will not say.</p> <p>His wealth left him well connected. He shares a health club with Gordon Brown and Michael Barrymore, and shared a lawyer and a business with the late media tycoon, Robert Maxwell. In 1994, he acquired the New Statesman magazine. Add this to his political career and you have a heady mix. A man who cannot possibly locate the blurry line where financial influence stops and political influence begins because he lives his life on both sides at once. He twice loaned the Blair family his home in Tuscany for their summer holidays, gave a huge personal loan to Mandelson and contributed generously to the offices of both Brown and Blair, as well as former Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith.</p> <p>His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\"</p> <p>A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light?</p> <p>When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\"</p> <p>The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\"</p> <p>In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\"</p> <p>Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\"</p> <p>From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\"</p> <p>But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry.</p> <p>But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote.</p> <p>Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour by 1997 he was on the front bench.</p> <p>It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\"</p> <p>While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\"</p> <p>Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\"</p> <p>Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk.</p>",

His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\" A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light? When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\" The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\" In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\" Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\" From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\" But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry. But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote. Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour by 1997 he was on the front bench. It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\" While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\" Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\" Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk.",

      "body": "<p>This year's choice is positively inspiring. There's something for everyone: from a chic sporty look to technical hard-core gear and stylish performance clothing that doesn't cost the earth. </p> <p>Not only are the prices the best they have been in five years, but the shapes and colours are flattering with a lot of gear that is quite wearable on the high street. </p> <p>If you've skipped a ski season or two, you will notice the revolution in performance clothing. Clothes designed for maximum warmth used to be big and bulky, but now with waterproof and breathable fabrics the latest designs are much lighter. A new fabric that you are bound to see more of is Gore-Tex XCR (Xtra Comfort Rating) which eliminates the need for a liner and is 25% more breathable than standard Gore-Tex. (see Get your kit Out, page 21.) </p> <p>Look out for Outlast, an acrylic fibre lining that controls your body temperature by storing and releasing heat for when you need it. It works best the closer it is to your body and is used in underwear, socks, gloves and jackets. </p> <p>Gone are the days of cotton or wool long-johns that either itch or never dry out. Now you need layers with good wicking qualities, which means materials made of microfibres that work by transporting moisture away from the skin. Look for Patagonia's men's silkweight capilene boxers and Odlo's quick drying women's vests, bras and knickers. </p> <p>For the ultimate glam ski-suit, Killy Sport uses the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of stretch fabrics that combine winter warmth and high-street fashion. </p> <p>Another company new to the UK market is Kjus, with some excellent technical ski-wear at the top end of the market. Jackets feature the Outlast temperature- regulating liner. French label Eider has some stylish technical gear for men and women. Best value is a three-in-one ladies jacket for \u00a3199. </p> <p>At the lower end of the market, a Columbia ladies three-in-one jacket costs \u00a3125 while Quiksilver's ladies long jacket complete with waterproof liner is \u00a395. </p> <p><strong>Take a short cut to have more fun</strong></p> <p>A few years ago, ski equipment was markedly more expensive in the UK than in continental Europe. Nowadays, there is little difference in price across the European Union, so it is worth buying before you go to the slopes. </p> <p> The current trend for shorter race skis has filtered through to all recreational models. No casual, two-weeks-a-year skiers should feel too \"macho\" to step down 20cm or 30cm from the lengths they were used to on their old \"straight\" skis. For any given length, carving skis have a greater actual edge length and surface area, so they are more stable in the turn and provide greater flotation in powder. </p> <p>Atomic has just brought in an excellent new Giant Slalom ski with a tight radius of 22m, the <strong> BetaRace 10.22</strong> (\u00a3389). Other companies, such as Salomon and Head, have also increased the sidecuts of their GS models, the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400), and the <strong> Head Cyber Worldcup Ti</strong> (\u00a3370). </p> <p>It was all change for slalom skis last season. The trailblazers were the Rossignol <strong> 9S Pro 9.9</strong> , and the Salomon <strong> Superaxe Equipe</strong> . This year's versions are the Rossignol <strong> T-Power 9S Plate</strong> (\u00a3400) and the Salomon <strong> Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V</strong> (\u00a3400). All manufacturers are producing short slalom skis, and most have discontinued their old, \"straight\" skis. </p> <p>On-piste skis are also getting shorter and curvier. It is now acceptable even for experts to use skis that are about the same length as their own height. </p> <p>Rossignol has introduced a whole new range, its T-Power models, designed to be skied 20-25cm shorter than their other models. The range includes the <strong> T-Power Viper</strong> (\u00a3330), <strong> T-Power Cobra</strong> (\u00a3220), and a special women's model, the <strong> T-Power Saphir</strong> (\u00a3220). </p> <p>Salomon has a new ski intended to make life easier for beginners and early intermediates: the <strong> Verse 9</strong> (\u00a3240) - the bindings are mounted further forward than usual to make turning easier for skiers with poor technique. </p> <p>It's important to remember that you won't perform any better by buying a ski above your level of ability. If anything, this will cause your skiing to deteriorate, as the skis will be too stiff for you - you will not be able to apply enough edging pressure for them to function to optimum effect. </p> <p>Free-ride skis, with the wider waists but still shapely sidecuts, is now well-established with the public. They are designed to make off-piste skiing as easy as possible, without compromising performance on firm pistes. The best-known is the Salomon <strong> X-Scream Series</strong> (\u00a3390), now entering its fourth season. But Salomon also has two new free-ride models, the <strong> Scream 10 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3570) and the <strong> Scream 8 Pilot</strong> (\u00a3430) - these prices include bindings. </p> <p>K2 also has a new free-ride range, the MOD series, with a secondary core running like a rib along the entire length of the top surface, designed to give you a smoother ride. </p> <p>There are more ultra-wide free-ride skis on offer. Established models such as the Rossignol <strong> Bandit XX</strong> (\u00a3300), the Dynastar <strong> 4x4 Big </strong> (\u00a3350) and the <strong> K2 AK Launcher</strong> (\u00a3349) have been joined by Head's <strong> Monster Cross</strong> (\u00a3330), Salomon's <strong> AK Rocket</strong> (\u00a3430), Fischer's <strong> Alltrax Big Stix</strong> (\u00a3300) and Nordica's <strong> W9.1FF </strong> (\u00a3320). Volkl's <strong> Vertigo G41 Pro</strong> (\u00a3370) is slightly wider than last year's G40 Pro. They're all a bit of a handful on a firm piste, but they can take a lot of the work out of skiing powder for experts and most confident intermediates, although some models need a certain amount of speed to function at their best. </p> <p>Skis that bend upwards at both ends, so you can ski backwards, have been around since the early days of freestyle in the 1970s. But the \"New School\" movement of aerial tricks has given them a fresh boost, and Salomon's <strong> Teneighty</strong> (\u00a3300) were a hit when launched last season. Thousands of \"normal\" skiers found they could enjoy skiing on them, and the wide profile, originally designed for solid landings, also helped skiers stay near the surface in deep snow. </p> <p>Now, every company has a twintip, allowing a wide range of skiers to look trendy and have a ski that is easy to manoeuvre with. Pick of the bunch is the Rossignol <strong> Pow'air</strong> (\u00a3230), the K2 <strong> Enemy </strong> (\u00a3339), and the Dynastar <strong> Concept </strong> (\u00a3200). New are Nordica's <strong> Z-TT</strong> (\u00a3210), Atomic's <strong> Beta Free Zone Bump</strong> (\u00a3270), Fischer's <strong> Unlimited</strong> (\u00a3250), and Head's <strong> Air Head</strong> (\u00a3240). </p> <p> Salomon's new Pilot system is probably the biggest innovation in fitting bindings to skis since the demise of the old leather straps. Instead of screws drilled downwards into the ski, transverse bolts through the core of the ski hold the bindings on, via arches that curve down over the sidewalls. As well as making binding-mounting much eas ier, they allow the ski to flex freely along its whole length, eliminating the \"flat spot\" that is often created underneath the boot. </p> <p>It's important to take your time when buying boots. At the very least, you should wear them at home for a couple of hours before taking them abroad. If they become uncomfortable at this stage, you may have the option of a refund or exchange, if they are not dirty or scuffed. </p> <p>If possible, test the comfort of the boots with actual skiing movements; a short session on a \"ski simulator\", such as the Metro Ski or the Realli Ski, may give you an idea of how they feel without damaging or soiling the boot. </p> <p>It's even more important for boots than for skis that you buy a model with the right stiffness of flex for your ability. The better the skier, the stiffer the boot required. </p> <p>Many models offer \"thermofit\" systems, where the inner boot is heated for about five minutes on a hot air blower. When you put the boot on, it moulds itself to your foot and maintains its shape after cooling. A custom-made insole may also help with the fit. </p> <p>Less-experienced skiers may want a boot with a \"walk mode\" - this is a catch that allows the upper boot to flex backwards, making walking easier. But it's important to switch the catch back to \"ski mode\" before hitting the slopes. Head's Auto Ski/Walk System does this for you automatically, and is available on all models up to the <strong> Head Cyber</strong> <strong> C9.5 </strong> (\u00a3180). </p> <p>Nordica has changed the shape of the \"Exopower\" frame of stiffer plastic in their top-performance boots to maximise the transmission of forces. They've called their new design the \"Exopower II\", and it features in all their boots from the <strong> Wave 5.1</strong> (\u00a3160) up to the <strong> K9.1</strong> (\u00a3250). </p> <p>Salomon has a new range of boots, the X-Waves, which draw on design features of their racing boots but are more forgiving in fit and flex. Prices range from \u00a3200 for the <strong> X-Wave 8.0</strong> , to \u00a3240 for the <strong> X-Wave 10.0</strong> . The new Salomon <strong> Teneighty Pro Model</strong> (\u00a3250) is made of translucent plastic, and aimed at the young \"New School Free-ride\" market. </p> <p>Rossignol continues with its proven \"Cockpit\" system, a frame of stiffer plastic. This is moulded close to the foot for heightened edge control in its high-performance models, like the <strong> Freeride XX</strong> (\u00a3220), and mounted on the outside of the boot for greater comfort in its intermediate models, such as the <strong> Salto GTX</strong> (\u00a3170). </p> <p> <strong> Where to buy</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Snow+Rock</strong> nationwide and mail order 0845 100 1000, </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.snowandrock.com\">www.snowandrock.com </a> </p> <p> <strong>Lillywhites</strong> 020-7915 4000 </p> <p><strong> Ski 47</strong> three stores in London 020-7384 1979 </p> <p><strong> Blacks</strong> nationwide and mail order 0191 518 2002 </p> <p><strong> Ellis Brigham </strong> nationwide and mail order 0161-834 5555, <a href=\"http://www.ellis-brigham.com\">www.ellis-brigham.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Trekkitt Mountain Sports </strong> 01600 715777</p>",

      "bodyText": "This year's choice is positively inspiring. There's something for everyone: from a chic sporty look to technical hard-core gear and stylish performance clothing that doesn't cost the earth. Not only are the prices the best they have been in five years, but the shapes and colours are flattering with a lot of gear that is quite wearable on the high street. If you've skipped a ski season or two, you will notice the revolution in performance clothing. Clothes designed for maximum warmth used to be big and bulky, but now with waterproof and breathable fabrics the latest designs are much lighter. A new fabric that you are bound to see more of is Gore-Tex XCR (Xtra Comfort Rating) which eliminates the need for a liner and is 25% more breathable than standard Gore-Tex. (see Get your kit Out, page 21.) Look out for Outlast, an acrylic fibre lining that controls your body temperature by storing and releasing heat for when you need it. It works best the closer it is to your body and is used in underwear, socks, gloves and jackets. Gone are the days of cotton or wool long-johns that either itch or never dry out. Now you need layers with good wicking qualities, which means materials made of microfibres that work by transporting moisture away from the skin. Look for Patagonia's men's silkweight capilene boxers and Odlo's quick drying women's vests, bras and knickers. For the ultimate glam ski-suit, Killy Sport uses the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of stretch fabrics that combine winter warmth and high-street fashion. Another company new to the UK market is Kjus, with some excellent technical ski-wear at the top end of the market. Jackets feature the Outlast temperature- regulating liner. French label Eider has some stylish technical gear for men and women. Best value is a three-in-one ladies jacket for \u00a3199. At the lower end of the market, a Columbia ladies three-in-one jacket costs \u00a3125 while Quiksilver's ladies long jacket complete with waterproof liner is \u00a395. Take a short cut to have more fun A few years ago, ski equipment was markedly more expensive in the UK than in continental Europe. Nowadays, there is little difference in price across the European Union, so it is worth buying before you go to the slopes. The current trend for shorter race skis has filtered through to all recreational models. No casual, two-weeks-a-year skiers should feel too \"macho\" to step down 20cm or 30cm from the lengths they were used to on their old \"straight\" skis. For any given length, carving skis have a greater actual edge length and surface area, so they are more stable in the turn and provide greater flotation in powder. Atomic has just brought in an excellent new Giant Slalom ski with a tight radius of 22m, the BetaRace 10.22 (\u00a3389). Other companies, such as Salomon and Head, have also increased the sidecuts of their GS models, the Salomon Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V (\u00a3400), and the Head Cyber Worldcup Ti (\u00a3370). It was all change for slalom skis last season. The trailblazers were the Rossignol 9S Pro 9.9 , and the Salomon Superaxe Equipe . This year's versions are the Rossignol T-Power 9S Plate (\u00a3400) and the Salomon Poweraxe Equipe 10 2V (\u00a3400). All manufacturers are producing short slalom skis, and most have discontinued their old, \"straight\" skis. On-piste skis are also getting shorter and curvier. It is now acceptable even for experts to use skis that are about the same length as their own height. Rossignol has introduced a whole new range, its T-Power models, designed to be skied 20-25cm shorter than their other models. The range includes the T-Power Viper (\u00a3330), T-Power Cobra (\u00a3220), and a special women's model, the T-Power Saphir (\u00a3220). Salomon has a new ski intended to make life easier for beginners and early intermediates: the Verse 9 (\u00a3240) - the bindings are mounted further forward than usual to make turning easier for skiers with poor technique. It's important to remember that you won't perform any better by buying a ski above your level of ability. If anything, this will cause your skiing to deteriorate, as the skis will be too stiff for you - you will not be able to apply enough edging pressure for them to function to optimum effect. Free-ride skis, with the wider waists but still shapely sidecuts, is now well-established with the public. They are designed to make off-piste skiing as easy as possible, without compromising performance on firm pistes. The best-known is the Salomon X-Scream Series (\u00a3390), now entering its fourth season. But Salomon also has two new free-ride models, the Scream 10 Pilot (\u00a3570) and the Scream 8 Pilot (\u00a3430) - these prices include bindings. K2 also has a new free-ride range, the MOD series, with a secondary core running like a rib along the entire length of the top surface, designed to give you a smoother ride. There are more ultra-wide free-ride skis on offer. Established models such as the Rossignol Bandit XX (\u00a3300), the Dynastar 4x4 Big (\u00a3350) and the K2 AK Launcher (\u00a3349) have been joined by Head's Monster Cross (\u00a3330), Salomon's AK Rocket (\u00a3430), Fischer's Alltrax Big Stix (\u00a3300) and Nordica's W9.1FF (\u00a3320). Volkl's Vertigo G41 Pro (\u00a3370) is slightly wider than last year's G40 Pro. They're all a bit of a handful on a firm piste, but they can take a lot of the work out of skiing powder for experts and most confident intermediates, although some models need a certain amount of speed to function at their best. Skis that bend upwards at both ends, so you can ski backwards, have been around since the early days of freestyle in the 1970s. But the \"New School\" movement of aerial tricks has given them a fresh boost, and Salomon's Teneighty (\u00a3300) were a hit when launched last season. Thousands of \"normal\" skiers found they could enjoy skiing on them, and the wide profile, originally designed for solid landings, also helped skiers stay near the surface in deep snow. Now, every company has a twintip, allowing a wide range of skiers to look trendy and have a ski that is easy to manoeuvre with.

It's important to take your time when buying boots. At the very least, you should wear them at home for a couple of hours before taking them abroad. If they become uncomfortable at this stage, you may have the option of a refund or exchange, if they are not dirty or scuffed. If possible, test the comfort of the boots with actual skiing movements; a short session on a \"ski simulator\", such as the Metro Ski or the Realli Ski, may give you an idea of how they feel without damaging or soiling the boot. It's even more important for boots than for skis that you buy a model with the right stiffness of flex for your ability. The better the skier, the stiffer the boot required. Many models offer \"thermofit\" systems, where the inner boot is heated for about five minutes on a hot air blower.

      "body": "<p>Back in London the next Wednesday, Nicky's topic is Spiritual Warfare: How Can I Resist The Devil? He says that the Devil's tricks include planting doubts - I wonder if he is referring to those people, such as Alice and myself, who doubted the power of tongues. Then I think, maybe the Devil really is planting doubts in my mind. My article is becoming increasingly anti-Nicky. Is Satan working within me? I conclude that I have been on this story for a long time and perhaps need a few weeks off. Nicky turns up the heat. He says we must not take an unhealthy interest in horror movies, ouija boards, palmists, healers, and so on. These are the Devil's tools. </p> <p>Later, in the small group, a woman called Suzanne asks a question. She didn't speak in tongues in Kidderminster but she did burst into tears. \"I went to a clairvoyant a few weeks ago,\" says Suzanne. \"That surely can't be a sin.\" </p> <p>\"I'm afraid it is,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Really?\" </p> <p>\"I would actually ask God for forgiveness for that,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Oh, come on,\" snorts Suzanne. \"Where does the Bible say that?\" </p> <p>\"Deuteronomy,\" says Nicky. </p> <p>\"Oh,\" says Suzanne. </p> <p>\"Poor Suzanne,\" whispers Alice to me, \"being made to feel guilty about going to some silly clairvoyant.\" The atmosphere has changed. \"Things are coming to the boil,\" says Alice. \"Can't you feel the screws being tightened?\" </p> <p>\"How are you feeling?\" I ask her. </p> <p>\"Judged,\" she says. </p> <p>Annie is no longer freaked out about speaking in tongues. She feels instead that she experienced God's love in Kidderminster. \"It was the most beautiful experience of my life,\" she says. At first, she hated it, but now she realises that her perception was wrong and that the tongue-speakers are the lucky ones. Annie can now speak in tongues. </p> <p>Nicky asks Tony to tell the group what happened to him in Kidderminster, but he quietly replies, \"No comment.\"</p> <p> Then Alice confronts Nicky. She tells him she felt trapped in Kidderminster. \"It was group pressure. I am very, very upset. I know that you're looking at me like I'm a failure.\" Nicky smiles: \"Nothing could be further from the truth. We simply want to create a non-threatening, non-judgmental environment.\" </p> <p> \"Judged is what I feel,\" says Alice.</p> <p> \"Then we have failed,\" says Nicky.</p> <p> Later that night, Nicky holds me back for a moment. I think he's concerned about how I responded to the tongues. After my Joel mini-testimony, I presume he hoped that I, too, would speak in them. \"Some journalists miss the story,\" says Nicky. \"Lots of journalists miss the story. But you haven't. You've got the story. I knew it from the beginning.\" </p> <p> \"What is the story?\" I ask Nicky. </p> <p> \"That something amazing is happening,\" he says. \"Something incredible. All over the world. In 116 countries.\"</p> <p> \"I thought it was 112 countries,\" I say. </p> <p>\"That was a month ago,\" says Nicky. \"Now it's 116 countries.\" We laugh. \"I would feel absolutely awful about Alice,\" he says, \"but I feel completely free from responsibility.\" </p> <p> \"Do you?\" I ask. \"I'm not hypnotising anybody,\" he says. \"I don't know anything about hypnosis.\" It is getting late. Tomorrow is the start of the Alpha international conference. There will be much good news to report. Alpha is up 156% in New Zealand; one-third of all churches there now run the course. My personal experience with Alpha finishes here. I miss the last few weeks because I have to travel to America. In my group, of those who lasted the course, about 70% were won over.</p> <p> Alice leaves some messages on my answerphone. She says I have missed some incredible things. I call her and ask what happened. \"It was just amazing,\" she says. \"Nicky did a session on healing.\"</p> <p> \"Healing?\"</p> <p> \"Healing by prayer. He started saying, 'I sense someone here has a lump on their left breast that they're very concerned about.' There were maybe 25 of these, and he got it right every time. People were standing up and everyone prayed for them. And then I asked them to pray for my horse, who's ill, and the horse got better.

      "bodyText": "Back in London the next Wednesday, Nicky's topic is Spiritual Warfare: How Can I Resist The Devil? He says that the Devil's tricks include planting doubts - I wonder if he is referring to those people, such as Alice and myself, who doubted the power of tongues. Then I think, maybe the Devil really is planting doubts in my mind. My article is becoming increasingly anti-Nicky. Is Satan working within me? I conclude that I have been on this story for a long time and perhaps need a few weeks off. Nicky turns up the heat. He says we must not take an unhealthy interest in horror movies, ouija boards, palmists, healers, and so on. These are the Devil's tools. Later, in the small group, a woman called Suzanne asks a question. She didn't speak in tongues in Kidderminster but she did burst into tears. \"I went to a clairvoyant a few weeks ago,\" says Suzanne. \"That surely can't be a sin.\" \"I'm afraid it is,\" says Nicky. \"Really?\" \"I would actually ask God for forgiveness for that,\" says Nicky. \"Oh, come on,\" snorts Suzanne. \"Where does the Bible say that?\" \"Deuteronomy,\" says Nicky. \"Oh,\" says Suzanne. \"Poor Suzanne,\" whispers Alice to me, \"being made to feel guilty about going to some silly clairvoyant.\" The atmosphere has changed. \"Things are coming to the boil,\" says Alice. \"Can't you feel the screws being tightened?\" \"How are you feeling?\" I ask her. \"Judged,\" she says. Annie is no longer freaked out about speaking in tongues. She feels instead that she experienced God's love in Kidderminster. \"It was the most beautiful experience of my life,\" she says. At first, she hated it, but now she realises that her perception was wrong and that the tongue-speakers are the lucky ones. Annie can now speak in tongues. Nicky asks Tony to tell the group what happened to him in Kidderminster, but he quietly replies, \"No comment.\" Then Alice confronts Nicky. She tells him she felt trapped in Kidderminster. \"It was group pressure. I am very, very upset. I know that you're looking at me like I'm a failure.\" Nicky smiles: \"Nothing could be further from the truth. We simply want to create a non-threatening, non-judgmental environment.\" \"Judged is what I feel,\" says Alice. \"Then we have failed,\" says Nicky. Later that night, Nicky holds me back for a moment. I think he's concerned about how I responded to the tongues. After my Joel mini-testimony, I presume he hoped that I, too, would speak in them. \"Some journalists miss the story,\" says Nicky. \"Lots of journalists miss the story. But you haven't. You've got the story. I knew it from the beginning.\" \"What is the story?\" I ask Nicky. \"That something amazing is happening,\" he says. \"Something incredible. All over the world. In 116 countries.\" \"I thought it was 112 countries,\" I say. \"That was a month ago,\" says Nicky. \"Now it's 116 countries.\" We laugh. \"I would feel absolutely awful about Alice,\" he says, \"but I feel completely free from responsibility.\" \"Do you?\" I ask. \"I'm not hypnotising anybody,\" he says. \"I don't know anything about hypnosis.\" It is getting late. Tomorrow is the start of the Alpha international conference. There will be much good news to report. Alpha is up 156% in New Zealand; one-third of all churches there now run the course. My personal experience with Alpha finishes here. I miss the last few weeks because I have to travel to America. In my group, of those who lasted the course, about 70% were won over. Alice leaves some messages on my answerphone. She says I have missed some incredible things. I call her and ask what happened. \"It was just amazing,\" she says. \"Nicky did a session on healing.\" \"Healing?\" \"Healing by prayer. He started saying, 'I sense someone here has a lump on their left breast that they're very concerned about.' There were maybe 25 of these, and he got it right every time. People were standing up and everyone prayed for them. And then I asked them to pray for my horse, who's ill, and the horse got better. And I had a terrible pain in my left side and I didn't mention it, but Nicky said he sensed it and everyone prayed for me and now the pain is gone.\" \"Wow,\" I say. \"Nicky was gutted that you missed it,\" says Alice. \"You sound like you've changed your mind again,\" I say. \"Oh, I don't know,\" says Alice. \"All I can say is that my horse got better and the pain has gone from my left side.\" She pauses. \"For all my problems with Kidderminster, I've got to say that Nicky is quite brilliant. He's wonderful.\" And I have to admit that, for all my problems with Kidderminster, too, I can only agree with her. \u0095 Some names in this piece have been changed to protect the identities of those concerned.",

Potentially embarrassing details of secret meetings and negotiations between the two party leaders risk triggering a backlash among Labour ministers and MPs opposed to \"the project\" when they are made public. The first volume of Mr Ashdown's diaries, covering events up to the 1997 election, will reveal how the relationship between the two rivals-cum-allies was much closer than previously admitted and kept hidden from even close colleagues. Mr Ashdown and Mr Blair started regular face-to-face discussions within weeks of the Labour leader's election in the summer of 1994 after John Smith's death. If Mr Blair had not won a landslide 179-seat majority after John Major's Tories collapsed, prominent sources in both parties have claimed the pair intended to form a coalition, with Mr Ashdown taking a seat in the cabinet as foreign secretary.

Senior figures in Labour and the Liberal Democrats have confirmed that Mr Blair and Mr Ashdown started meeting monthly shortly after the former's coronation as Labour leader and would coordinate attacks on Mr Major at question time, calling each other every Tuesday and Thursday morning. Watching Mr Blair's Labour conference speech ditching clause four in October 1994 in the front room of his Yeovil constituency home, Mr Ashdown described him as a \"politician I can do business with. He is very good\". The encounters were planned in great secrecy and initially given a codename, \"the Jo group\", after Jo Phillips, then Mr Ashdown's press and policy adviser, to keep details from all but a chosen few. Times, places and who would be invited were agreed through Ms Phillips and Anji Hunter, Mr Blair's loyal aide, who now controls access to the prime minister in No 10, with Mr Ashdown's own secretary, Becky Vye, listing them as private engagements in the Liberal Democrat leader's weekly diary circulated to MPs. Early meetings included a dinner at Derry Irvine's north London home with the future lord chancellor also playing host to Peter Mandelson on the Labour side and Ashdown confidante Richard Holme. \"Paddy came back charmed by Alison (Irvine's wife), enthusiastic about their art collection, and enchanted by the garden,\" said a former Lib Dem official. \"He genuinely thought Blair was unlike previous Labour leaders and the two thought very similarly on many issues in Britain and Europe.\" The meetings were almost always held away from the Commons with the two leaders and their wives also dining at each other's London homes. \"There was a personal chemistry, \"mutual respect and trust,\" said the ex-official. \"Paddy knew Blair was going places, Blair welcomed Paddy's insights.\" Mr Ashdown shared his life with a tape recorder every night, recording who said what and his private views, to produce the diaries which were dubbed \"Paddy's pension plan\" when it emerged they would be published after he quit as party leader.

At least one Liberal Democrat spokesman complained that after meetings, Mr Ashdown would collect and destroy agendas distributed to his circle, leaving the only accurate record in his own hands.

The size of Labour's majority made a coalition not only unnecessary but out of the question, as the pair agreed during another telephone conversation 24 hours later. The first volume of Mr Ashdown's diaries does not cover the period after the election. However, Mr Blair and Mr Ashdown discussed closer cooperation in the unlikely setting of Novosibirsk in Siberia, where their RAF VC10 touched down to refuel early on July 1, 1997, on the way back to Britain after the handover of Hong Kong to China. Walking round the plane, Mr Blair in a souvenir blue Denver fire service tee-shirt, picked up a few weeks earlier at the G7 summit, discussed what was to become the five-a-side joint cabinet consultative committee with Mr Ashdown. The anti-coalition majority in the parliamentary Labour party, including much of the cabinet, has long suspected the joint committee was intended to lead to what Mr Ashdown called The Full Monty. A leak last November of Mr Ashdown's private files recorded how during a Downing Street dinner on October 21, 1997, Mr Blair had discussed axing \"two easy people to move out of the cabinet\" - believed to have been David Clark and Gavin Strang - to make way for Menzies Campbell and Alan Beith. After dinner, the furtive group moved into the sitting room, where Mr Ashdown said it should not be seen as a \"grubby deal about cabinet seats\", so he would stay out to \"reduce your problem in finding a senior person to give way for me.\" However, Mr Ashdown wrote: \"He was really worried about the reaction from his own party.\" A possible coalition is believed to have been discussed a second time since the election.

BT Surf Together will offer unlimited internet access and metered talk time for \u00a314.99, while a combined internet and voice package for local evening and weekend calls, going under the name BT Talk and Surf Together, will cost \u00a317.99.

      "bodyText": "Unlimited internet access for a fixed fee is the holy grail for most people who surf the web. This week the Guardian revealed that BT plans to go part of the way. The company confirmed it will extend its Together package on December 1 to include three unlimited local evening and weekend schemes. BT Surf Together will offer unlimited internet access and metered talk time for \u00a314.99, while a combined internet and voice package for local evening and weekend calls, going under the name BT Talk and Surf Together, will cost \u00a317.99. BT Talk Together, an unmetered voice package will cost \u00a314.99, capping monthly local calls at \u00a35 above the new standard line rental of \u00a39.99. Surftime, the company's current unlimited internet package, has been partially killed off. The unmetered anytime scheme that costs \u00a319.99 survives.

The look on her face is detached, melancholy, distracted from her job serving at the bar in the vast crowded room reflected in the glass behind her. There is a locket around her neck that is a token of another life, a love a long way from this job.</p> <p> This is an unusual portrait because it is of someone at work, and someone who to our eyes is defined by her work and is profoundly unhappy with it. She is alienated from her surroundings, as if there is a glass pane between her and everyone else in the room - the drinkers, chatters-up, lovers, liars, thieves and businessmen. Manet conveys Suzon's estrangement from her world by the fact that she is the only person in this painting who is not reflected in glass. Everyone else in the painting is seen in the big bar mirror: the quickly painted, harshly reflected faces and bodies, a woman in gloves with her lover or client, someone else looking at the scene with binoculars. They are objects she is looking at - but at one remove, through a glass darkly.</p> <p> The only solid realities are the marble bar top and the bottles - cr\u00e8me de menthe, champagne, beer - a bowl of oranges, two flowers delicately placed in a vase. She has both hands firmly on the bar as if she needs to touch something solid, in case she should be carried away by the vortex of light and shapes reflected in the mirror. </p> <p>This is not a realistic painting of the Folies-Berg\u00e8re. Suzon did work there, but she posed for the painting in Manet's studio, behind a table laden with bottles. He merged this image with rapid painted sketches he made at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re. There is no attempt to make the image cohere: there is, as contemporary critics pointed out, an inconsistency to the relationship between the reflections in the mirror and the real things. The man in the top hat approaching Suzon in a sinister way in the top right hand corner of the mirror would in reality have to be standing with his back to us in front of the bar, and Suzon herself should be reflected in an entirely different place. </p> <p>The dislocation of Suzon's world is deliberate. Paris is a hall of mirrors where Suzon floats helplessly, clinging to her bar. The flowers are a touching attempt to preserve a little humanity, as are her neat blue clothes and whole demeanour. It's amazing that contemporary critics saw her as a prostitute. </p> <p>And who are you? The top-hatted stranger, of course, the Jack the Ripper whose ghostly reflection approaches her with such menace in the mirror. Manet captures the coolness, cruelty and glamour of modern life. This is one of the keystones of modern art. </p> <p><strong> Inspirations and influences:</strong> A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re is a modern version of Velazquez's Las Meninas (1656-7), the most profound meditation on the portrait. In Las Meninas, ostensibly a picture of the royal Infanta and her retinue of children, pets and dwarf, Velazquez includes the king and queen reflected in a mirror at the back of this palace apartment. He himself stands painting them on a vast canvas looking at us, and we are the royal eye, looking back at the world that exists for our regal gaze. Manet worshipped Velazquez, and transferred this aesthetic of reflection to modern times, to create a world that only exists in mirrors; this turns the viewer into a spectral, disturbing presence, part of the crowd that Suzon looks at with such disillusion. The 20th-century painter whose portraits owe most to Manet was the flatly ironic Andy Warhol. </p> <p> <strong>Where is it? </strong> Courtauld Institute Gallery, London WC2 (020-7873 2526). </p>",

There is no attempt to make the image cohere: there is, as contemporary critics pointed out, an inconsistency to the relationship between the reflections in the mirror and the real things. The man in the top hat approaching Suzon in a sinister way in the top right hand corner of the mirror would in reality have to be standing with his back to us in front of the bar, and Suzon herself should be reflected in an entirely different place. The dislocation of Suzon's world is deliberate. Paris is a hall of mirrors where Suzon floats helplessly, clinging to her bar. The flowers are a touching attempt to preserve a little humanity, as are her neat blue clothes and whole demeanour. It's amazing that contemporary critics saw her as a prostitute. And who are you? The top-hatted stranger, of course, the Jack the Ripper whose ghostly reflection approaches her with such menace in the mirror. Manet captures the coolness, cruelty and glamour of modern life. This is one of the keystones of modern art. Inspirations and influences: A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re is a modern version of Velazquez's Las Meninas (1656-7), the most profound meditation on the portrait. In Las Meninas, ostensibly a picture of the royal Infanta and her retinue of children, pets and dwarf, Velazquez includes the king and queen reflected in a mirror at the back of this palace apartment. He himself stands painting them on a vast canvas looking at us, and we are the royal eye, looking back at the world that exists for our regal gaze. Manet worshipped Velazquez, and transferred this aesthetic of reflection to modern times, to create a world that only exists in mirrors; this turns the viewer into a spectral, disturbing presence, part of the crowd that Suzon looks at with such disillusion. The 20th-century painter whose portraits owe most to Manet was the flatly ironic Andy Warhol. Where is it? Courtauld Institute Gallery, London WC2 (020-7873 2526).",

      "body": "<p><strong> October 21</strong></p> <p><strong> HD Thoreau, 1857</strong></p> <p> Is not the poet bound to write his own biography? Is there any other work for him but a good journal? We do not wish to know how his imaginary hero, but how he, the actual hero, lived from day to day. </p> <p><strong> William Allingham, 1880</strong></p> <p> Looking at the chimney-piece, Tennyson said; 'When I began to read Italian, I wrote down every word that puzzled me on the sides and front of the chimney-piece where I lodged - painted white - and made a kind of dictionary for myself. I went away for two or three days and when I came back it was all washed off. \"Thought it was dirt,\" the woman said. Worse than that - when I was twenty-two I wrote a beautiful poem on Poland, hundreds of lines long, and the housemaid lit the fire with it. I never could recover it.' </p> <p> <strong> Dawn Powell, 1941</strong></p> <p> The gray busy rainy sky I love, and would like to be out under. But weather, sky, night, sun, wind, rain, or friends are forbidden when there is not money. The invitation of a morning must be ignored for it is a reminder that money must be made - therefore work must be attempted. Actually, there is the empty purse too - a walk, an impulse to use a phone, a bus, buy a newspaper, and these are impossible. I never see autumn anymore without the feeling that I have missed summer - out of doors so forbidden to the poor and the desperate; for us, there is no time, no sun, no daylight, but the endless crouching over a typewriter, trying to keep it from its own will, forcing it in a dozen suggested paths to fortune or at least security. </p> <p><strong> JR Ackerley, 1948</strong></p> <p>What should I do if I came upon a murder, I sometimes ask myself as Queenie [his dog] and I push our way through the vast tangles of bracken where few other people walk? The common is a likely place for murder, as it is for suicide - the angry lustful man who finds he is not, after all, to be granted the sexual relief that his pick-up has led him to expect. What should I do, I ask myself, if I suddenly smelt something nasty - as I often do - and pushing along came upon a strangled woman? I wouldn't do anything, unless I covered it up with leaves to give the murderer a better chance of escape. I certainly wouldn't report it. I have harboured thoughts of murder myself in my life; I could never help to denounce or catch anyone else. </p> <p> <strong> Andy Warhol, 1980</strong></p> <p> I ran into a boy whose job is to go shopping for John and Yoko, to buy them clothes and things. I asked him if they'd ever made him bring anything back and he said just once. I asked him if they ever wore any of the clothes they bought since they don't go out, and he said, \"They're going to make a comeback. They've been wearing them to the studio.\" Oh, and the best thing he said was that when he started to work for them he had to sign a paper that said, \"I will not write a book about John Lennon and/or Yoko One. \" Isn't that great? He said he loves his job. I should find somebody to help me shop - show me where all the good new things are. </p> <p><strong> October 20</strong></p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Gide,1929</strong></p> <p> There are certain days on which one feels oneself particularly wide of the mark; behindhand; in debt; showing a deficit. Today I see nothing but deficiencies everywhere; what I lack; where I fell short ...Take refuge in sleep.</p> <p> <strong>Virginia Woolf, 1939</strong> </p> <p> The most - what? - impressive, no, that's not it - sight in London on Friday was the queue, mostly children with suitcases, outside Warren Street tube. This was about 11.30 We thought they were evacuees waiting for a bus. But there they were, in a much longer line, with women, men, more bags, blankets, sitting still at 3. Lining up for the shelter in the night's raid - which came of course. Thus, if they left the tube at 6 (a bad raid on Thursday) they were back again at 11. So to Tavistock Square. With a sigh of relief saw a heap of ruins. Three houses, I should say, gone. Basement all rubble. Only relics an old basket chair ( bought in Fitzroy Square days) and Penman's board To Let. Otherwise bricks and wood splinters. One glass door in the next house hanging. I could just see a piece of my studio wall standing: otherwise rubble where I wrote so many books. </p> <p>Open air where we sat so many nights, gave so many parties. The hotel not touched. So to Meck [Mecklenburgh Square]. All again. Litter, glass, black soft dust, plaster powder. Miss T, and Miss E. in trousers, overalls and turbans, sweeping. I noted the flutter of Miss T.'s hands: the same as Miss Perkins' Of course friendly and hospitable in the extreme. Jaunty jerky talk. Repetitions. So sorry we hadn't had her card ... to save you the shock. It's awful ... Upstairs she propped a leaning bookcase for us. Books all over dining room floor. In my sitting room glass all over Mrs. Hunter's cabinet - and so on. Only the drawing room with windows almost whole. A wind blowing though. I began to hunt out diaries</p> <p><strong>Norman Lewis, 1945</strong></p> <p> A narrow escape today while motor-cycling along the Via Partenope. I was riding towards the Castel Nuovo, through an area badly damaged by bombing, with the sea on the right and the semi-derelict buildings on the left, when I noticed a sudden change ahead from blue sky, sunshine and shadow, to a great opaque whiteness, shutting off the view of the port. The effect was one of a whole district blotted out by a pall of the white smoke sometimes spread from the chimneys of a factory producing lime. </p> <p> On turning a bend, I came upon an apocalyptic scene. A number of buildings including a bank had been pulverized by a terrific explosion that had clearly just taken place. Bodies were scattered all over the street, but here and there among them stood the living as motionless as statues, and all coated in thick white dust. What engraved this scene on the mind and the imagination was that nothing moved, and that the silence was total. Dust drifted down from the sky like a most delicate snowfall. A woman stood like Lot's wife turned to salt beside a cart drawn by two mules. One mule lay apparently dead, the other stood quietly at its side, without so much as twitching an ear. Nearby two men lay in the positions of bodies overcome by the ash at Pompeii, and a third, who had probably been in their company, stood swaying very slightly, his eyes shut. I spoke to him, but he did not reply. There was no blood to be seen anywhere.</p> <p> This turned out to be one of a series of explosions produced by delayed-action explosive devices constructed by the Germans shortly before their departure, in each case from several hundred mines buried under principal buildings. My friend White's visit to the Central Post Office at about the time I was motor-cycling along the Via Partenope nearly involved him in disaster. He had gone there to discuss the reorganization of the postal services and - I suspect - methods of censorship, and about ten minutes after he left the building blew up, killing heaven knows how many passers-by. A senseless massacre perpetrated on the Italian civil population. </p> <p> <strong>Andy Warhol, 1985</strong></p> <p> It's the fortieth anniversary of the UN and I think Mrs Marcos is in town. It's getting so scary in the Philippines. Some papers say the Marcoses are buying up everything in the US, but that could not be true, the papers can lie. Our government must want them out, though. Like the US must have wanted the Shah to fall. But let's see, did we want to lose Vietnam? No, but after everything that's in the papers this week, I get the Kennedys were just too busy having an affair with Marilyn to worry about Vietnam. </p> <p> <strong> October 19 </strong></p> <p><strong> Florence Farmborough, 1917</strong></p> <p> I saw one of our young doctors dressing a wound before the dirt and grime around it had been washed off. I gave way to my wrath and told him that he was asking for serious trouble if he had dressed the wound before first cleansing it. He rudely told me to mind my own business; I told him that it was my business to see that our soldiers' wounds were cleaned before bandaging. We exchanged many angry resentful words. But I knew that I was right; he knew that he was wrong. But he was a doctor! I was only a Sister!</p> <p> I worked it out before I went to sleep. I knew that I was growing coarse, bad-humoured and fault-finding. At first, I ascribed it to the pressure of warfare, the many hardships and humiliations, the conditions of our everyday life at the Front, when for days we could not undress, or even have a good wash. I decided that there were, indeed, good reasons for my bad temper; yet I began to feel ashamed of myself. Before I became a Red Cross nurse, I had been fully aware that there would be many exasperating moments, but I had been certain that I would overcome them - even welcome them in order to prove the strength of my will. I would often repeat those words of Goethe: 'Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille und ein Charakter im Strom der Welt'. ['Talent is developed in tranquillity, but character is moulded in the tumult of the world.'] I had wanted my character to be strengthened and to come through, as victor, in the struggle. But recently there had been times when the knowledge that I was rude and ill-tempered did not even bother me.</p> <p> Some of our Sisters and Brothers were not noted for their self-control and when they began to throw nasty, biting words at each other, I would tell myself: 'It is lack of education,' or 'It is the Russian temperament.' And now, I am doing the same thing! And I am English! We English have a reputation here for having our feelings well under control. I really am ashamed of myself and must take myself in hand. </p> <p><strong>Sir Hugh Casson, 1980</strong></p> <p> [Goa]<br> I am approached by a smart, young, white-clad figure, who trudges from a distance across the sands like a survivor from some disastrous desert expedition. He is carrying two bottles. He suggests I need a massage. 'Ah', he says, 'you very, very old man ... very tired ... very much work' ... He pinches my leg and my upper arm ...'very, very old', he says, shaking his head. I am nettled by this, and, refusing his attentions, walk off into the surf squaring my shoulders. But he has the last laugh as a comber knocks me off my feet. I remember a previous encounter with an itinerant masseur in Agra. When I refused his administrations, he offered, in sequence, his daughter or a copy of The Reader's Digest.</p> <p> <strong> October 18</strong></p> <p><strong>John Wesley, 1749</strong></p> <p> I rode, at the desire of John Bennet, to Rochdale, in Lancashire. As soon as ever we entered the town, we found the streets lined on both sides with multitudes of people, shouting, cursing, blaspheming, and gnashing upon us with their teeth. Perceiving it would not be practicable to preach abroad, I went into a large room, open to the street, and called aloud, 'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.' The word of God prevailed over the fierceness of man. None opposed or interrupted; and there was a very remarkable change in the behaviour of the people, as we afterwards went through the town.</p> <p> <strong> Rev. Francis Kilvert, 1870</strong> </p> <p>Old James Jones was breaking stones below Pentwyn. He told me how he had once cured his deafness for a time by pouring hot eel oil into his ear, and again by sticking into the ear an 'ellern' (elder) twig, and wearing it there night and day. The effect of the eel oil at first was, he said, to make his head and brains feel full of crawling creatures. </p> <p> <strong>Dearman Birchall, 1873</strong> </p> <p> I visited the county Prison alone and authorized the Governor to introduce gas into the carpenter's and brush shops, the expense not to exceed 10/-, the cost of necessary piping, and the work to be done by the prisoners; also purchase of new carpet for the bedroom of new laundry maid which has been papered and painted since the death of Miss Higgs from typhoid fever. I saw Butt who has a cold, and Cole who has nearly murdered his wife with a hot poker. </p> <p> <strong> Harold Nicolson, 1930</strong></p> <p> Feeling very depressed with life. Can't make out whether it is mere middle-aged depression or whether it is really that I loath journalism so much that it covers all my days with a dark cloud of shame. I feel that I have no time to add to my reputation by doing serious work and that my silly work day by day diminishes the reputation I have already acquired. I have become 'famous' as a radio comedian, and shall never be able to live down the impression thus acquired. In fact I feel a pretty feeble creature, just a soppy superficial humourist. I would give my soul to leave the Standard but I daren't risk it because of the money. Middle-age for a hedonist like myself is distressing in any case, but with most people it coincides with an increase of power and income. With me I have lost all serious employment, sacrificed my hopes of power, and am up against the anxiety of having not one penny in the world beyond what I earn. Is it this that makes me so perpetually unhappy? I have never been unhappy like this before. Till this year I have, except in rare periods of some definite worry or misery, woken each morning with the zest of being alive. Today each morning comes to me as a renewal of humiliation. It may be that I am overworked. I certainly mind things more than I should if my nerves were in order. I loathe getting fat for instance, and yet at my age, I can't expect to be young. Perhaps all this is good for me. Life has been an easy thing for me till this year 1930. And yet I shouldn't mind if I were in a position to fight my difficulties with what is best in me. What depresses me is that I can only live by exposing what is worst in me to the public gaze. I feel a fake: and it is that which humiliates and saddens me. </p> <p> <strong>James Lees-Milne, 1973</strong></p> <p> Wishing to buy another odd pair of trousers I went to what used to be called The Trouser Shop next to the Cafe Royal in Regent Street. The entrance looked different. A young man dressed in velvet, although in the middle of the day, approached me. Hesitantly I asked if this establishment still sold trousers. His greeting was 'Hullo!' which took me aback. I replied 'Hullo!' Then asked if he had any trousers that would suit me. With bland surprise he said regretfully, 'We can only cater for clients with a waist of less than 36,' and gave me a snide look. 'Besides, all our legs are much flared.' Oh dear, I found myself apologizing for being so old and untrendy. But on reflection, why the hell should a man apologize for no longer being young, as though he was thereby an inferior being? <br><strong> October 17</strong></p> <p><strong> John Evelyn, 1660</strong> </p> <p>This day were executed those murderous Traytors at Charing-Crosse, in sight of the place where they put to death their natural Prince, and in the Presence of the King his sonn, whom they also sought to kill: take[n] in the trap they laied for others: The Traytors executed were Scot, Scroope, Cook, Jones. I saw not their execution, but met their quarters mangld and cutt and reaking as they were brought from the Gallows in gaskets on the hurdle. </p> <p><strong> October 16</strong></p> <p><strong>John Wesley, 1783</strong></p> <p> I went on to Witney. There were uncommon thunder and lightning here last Thursday; but nothing to that which were there on Friday night. About ten the storm was just over the town; and both the bursts of thunder and lightning, or rather sheets of flame, were without intermission. Those that were asleep in the town were waked, and many thought the day of judgement was come. Men, women, and children, flocked out of their houses, and kneeled down in the streets. With the flames, the grace of God came down also in a manner never known before; and as the impression was general, so it was lasting: It did not pass away with the storm; but the spirit of seriousness, with that of grace and supplication, continued... </p> <p>\u0095 The Assassin's Cloak will be published by <a href=\"http://www.canongate.net\" target=\"_NEW\">Canongate</a> on November 23, priced \u00a325</p>",

He told me how he had once cured his deafness for a time by pouring hot eel oil into his ear, and again by sticking into the ear an 'ellern' (elder) twig, and wearing it there night and day. The effect of the eel oil at first was, he said, to make his head and brains feel full of crawling creatures. Dearman Birchall, 1873 I visited the county Prison alone and authorized the Governor to introduce gas into the carpenter's and brush shops, the expense not to exceed 10/-, the cost of necessary piping, and the work to be done by the prisoners; also purchase of new carpet for the bedroom of new laundry maid which has been papered and painted since the death of Miss Higgs from typhoid fever. I saw Butt who has a cold, and Cole who has nearly murdered his wife with a hot poker. Harold Nicolson, 1930 Feeling very depressed with life. Can't make out whether it is mere middle-aged depression or whether it is really that I loath journalism so much that it covers all my days with a dark cloud of shame. I feel that I have no time to add to my reputation by doing serious work and that my silly work day by day diminishes the reputation I have already acquired. I have become 'famous' as a radio comedian, and shall never be able to live down the impression thus acquired. In fact I feel a pretty feeble creature, just a soppy superficial humourist. I would give my soul to leave the Standard but I daren't risk it because of the money. Middle-age for a hedonist like myself is distressing in any case, but with most people it coincides with an increase of power and income. With me I have lost all serious employment, sacrificed my hopes of power, and am up against the anxiety of having not one penny in the world beyond what I earn. Is it this that makes me so perpetually unhappy? I have never been unhappy like this before. Till this year I have, except in rare periods of some definite worry or misery, woken each morning with the zest of being alive. Today each morning comes to me as a renewal of humiliation. It may be that I am overworked. I certainly mind things more than I should if my nerves were in order. I loathe getting fat for instance, and yet at my age, I can't expect to be young. Perhaps all this is good for me. Life has been an easy thing for me till this year 1930. And yet I shouldn't mind if I were in a position to fight my difficulties with what is best in me. What depresses me is that I can only live by exposing what is worst in me to the public gaze. I feel a fake: and it is that which humiliates and saddens me. James Lees-Milne, 1973 Wishing to buy another odd pair of trousers I went to what used to be called The Trouser Shop next to the Cafe Royal in Regent Street. The entrance looked different. A young man dressed in velvet, although in the middle of the day, approached me. Hesitantly I asked if this establishment still sold trousers. His greeting was 'Hullo!' which took me aback. I replied 'Hullo!' Then asked if he had any trousers that would suit me. With bland surprise he said regretfully, 'We can only cater for clients with a waist of less than 36,' and gave me a snide look. 'Besides, all our legs are much flared.' Oh dear, I found myself apologizing for being so old and untrendy. But on reflection, why the hell should a man apologize for no longer being young, as though he was thereby an inferior being? October 17 John Evelyn, 1660 This day were executed those murderous Traytors at Charing-Crosse, in sight of the place where they put to death their natural Prince, and in the Presence of the King his sonn, whom they also sought to kill: take[n] in the trap they laied for others: The Traytors executed were Scot, Scroope, Cook, Jones. I saw not their execution, but met their quarters mangld and cutt and reaking as they were brought from the Gallows in gaskets on the hurdle. October 16 John Wesley, 1783 I went on to Witney. There were uncommon thunder and lightning here last Thursday; but nothing to that which were there on Friday night. About ten the storm was just over the town; and both the bursts of thunder and lightning, or rather sheets of flame, were without intermission. Those that were asleep in the town were waked, and many thought the day of judgement was come. Men, women, and children, flocked out of their houses, and kneeled down in the streets. With the flames, the grace of God came down also in a manner never known before; and as the impression was general, so it was lasting: It did not pass away with the storm; but the spirit of seriousness, with that of grace and supplication, continued... \u0095 The Assassin's Cloak will be published by Canongate on November 23, priced \u00a325",

But in my thirty-year collection of Press cuttings on a diverse range of subjects, those marked 'England and the English' from British newspapers are twenty times as numerous as any other category.\" </p> <p>Shah died in 1996; but for that, his cuttings file on Englishness would be bursting his shelves. From pop records to political polemics, from television series to reports by charities and dirty flags of St George fluttering from truck cabs, the supposedly unspoken subject of English identity has been raised ever more loudly since. Sometimes, it comes disguised as an assertion or discussion of Britishness: the brief swagger of Cool Britannia, the Runnymede Trust's recent warnings about racial prejudice concealed within the word \"British\". But you can be sure that England, where the great majority of the people and power in these islands - for good or ill - have long resided, is a looming presence. Debates about British multiculturalism tend to mention Bradford more than Bridgend. Blur's big-selling \"Britpop\" songs were about London, not Lothian. </p> <p>Yet ask someone English what their nationality means, and often as not they will still pause and look blank, or mumble something about green fields and cricket. This traditional, rural, pre-immigration definition of Englishness still dominates: for all the current questioning talk about English identity, it is the version all others must compete with. John Major may have been mocked for his sepia speech-making about warm beer and bicycling maids, but people remember what he said. </p> <p>And just as England likes to deny it is interested in itself, so its old-fashioned self-image denies how the English actually live. Most of us reside, or at least work, in big towns and cities. We move along busy grey streets. We hear foreign accents at bus stops. We have never worked in a field. This restless, claustrophobic, relatively cosmopolitan existence has been the lot of the English majority since the industrial revolution two centuries ago, and of Londoners for centuries longer. Visitors from abroad realize it; from Friedrich Engels to French language students wandering open-mouthed in Soho, England has been a place of noise, crowds and a haphazard kind of modernity - not the misty outline of distant hills. </p> <p>Roger Scruton is fleetingly prepared to admit this. \"Foreign visitors in Elizabethan times,\" he writes, \"came away with the impression of a fiery, devious and intemperate people.\" But this is not the sort of discovery his book prefers to make. Instead Scruton, who is a huntsman and Tory philosopher, and runs an austere \"experimental farm\" in the hard, dry soil of northern Wiltshire, has written a defence, of some elegance and sophistication, of the crustiest version of Englishness imaginable. </p> <p>Its cover photograph perfectly establishes his tone. A couple in blurred focus and smart Edwardian clothes stand stiffly on a beach beneath white cliffs. She wears a hat against the milky English sun, there is a wet dog at their feet and a small child playing in the near distance. To Scruton this world, which lasted from late Victorian times until the early 1960s, was the high point of English achievement, a time when his countrymen were \"famous for their stoicism, their decorum, their honesty, their gentleness and their sexual puritanism\". Nowadays, he continues, characteristically cool but regretful, \"those qualities are no longer honoured\". He refers to his country throughout in the past tense. </p> <p>Such sentiments are always around in England - especially during Labour governments. The whiff of conservative partisanship, and the tendency of nostalgics to ignore the violence and instability of much of England's past, often makes their writing easy to dismiss. Scruton, though, is a different prospect. His frame of reference, for a start, includes authors who do not share his politics, such as Linda Colley, the historian of how Britain was constructed, and Tom Nairn, the Scottish prophet of its current dismantling. And Scruton writes with vivid reverence about the culture he sees disappearing, of \"trees wrestling upwards for the light\" in neglected hedges and country churches where \"a peculiar silence had been stored\". He can even be droll: \"Sexual intercourse, Larkin tells us, began in 1963,\" Scruton starts one of the passages of personal memoir here with which he most persuasively makes his argument. \"Certainly it had not begun in 1959 - not in Marlow at least.\" </p> <p>Before his southern English idyll in Marlow, it is a surprise to learn, Scruton grew up in a grimy part of Manchester. His father was a teacher \"occupying the lowest rung\". The family name, rumour had it, came from the illicit seduction of an ancestor who was a servant at Scruton Hall in Yorkshire. Yet the Manchester Scrutons were all thrift and neighbourliness. This enabled the future philosopher to ascend to grammar school and Oxford, in a manner he now considers typical of England at the time. Mentors of infinite patience and knowledge, all male, appear in these pages, instruct the author in manners and high culture, and modestly depart to their bachelor lodgings. </p> <p>This story has some of the moral momentum and intensity of a Victorian novel. Around his grainy memories, Scruton arranges essays about the educational, legal, and geographical structures that bred his favourite sort of Englishness in others. These sections are less successful. Over-familiar assertions of national uniqueness, loosely argued - the unreformed House of Lords, for example, is justified as representing the English countryside, as if it doesn't already have MPs - replace the usual Scruton logic and economy of expression. A brief, unattractive rage rises up in him against unpatriotic intellectuals and illegitimate children who \"litter the country\", undermining the sense of tolerance here, a quality he identifies as a prime English virtue. And the absence of urban England, let alone immigrant England, or the England of pre-eminent innovation in popular culture, begins to remove authority from the pages. When Scruton mourns \"the old improving risks\" his countrymen used to take, you know he has probably never seen a pirate radio station on an east London rooftop. </p> <p>Dennis Hardy understands better that Englishness has always existed in multiple, quarrelling versions. Since at least medieval times, he writes at the start of his careful scholar's volume, \"two oppositional themes have dogged the English character ... the ideal of a benign monarchy and that of a peasant republic.\" His focus is on people of the second inclination, what you might call the anti-Scruton tendency, and their efforts to establish an alternative England during the first half of the 20th century. </p> <p>Interestingly, very few of these socialists, communists and \"hairy-headed banana munchers\", as one cartoon summarized them, put their faith in urban England (although that would change after 1945). The countryside was their laboratory, in particular the Cotswolds and the deep-green southwest, where countless commuting stockbrokers, and Scruton himself, would later live out their own rural dreams. </p> <p>One of these tiny tribes of radicals, microscopically revealed by Hardy, was the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, set up by a 22-year-old pacifist called John Hargrave in August 1920. They went on camps, wore hooded smocks and fancied themselves, at first, a dissenters' version of the Boy Scouts, then later \"the only English national movement\". They advocated state control and redistribution of money; although membership was only in the hundreds, they were keenly watched by Special Branch. </p> <p>Hargrave felt that England had \"lost itself in a meaningless and devastating commercial scramble\". Scruton, by the end of his book, comes to pretty much the same conclusion. His talk of \"spivs\" ruining the City and \"agribusiness\" razing the countryside, of Labour and even the Tories complicit in the conquests of the global market, sounds like a man beginning to slip his political moorings. Perhaps a certain sort of English person, of whatever ideology, eventually ends up on the barricades against international capital.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine - it is a cold, sunny day but the train into work will be cramped and stuffy. How much should you put on? What if the weather turns nasty all of a sudden: a heavy shower when it was such a promising start? Will it mean sitting all morning in the office with the uncomfortable feeling of your skirt or trousers drying against your skin?</p> <p>Urban workers, who spend their lives partly in conditions of artificial heating and air-conditioning, partly subject to the whim of the weather, will pass through several environments in one day. Each time, they will want different things from their clothing - that's before they they even consider the gym at lunchtime or what to wear for a social date after work. In the city context, the traditional rules of spring, summer, autumn and winter are becoming less important. In their place is a fifth season of the controlled urban environment, where the old climate rules no longer apply.</p> <p>Let no one say that fashion is all fluff and nonsense, never responding to the consumer's needs. On the evidence of a new exhibition organised jointly by the London College of Fashion and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, designers - from Issey Miyake and Hussein Chalayan to relative unknowns - are increasingly focusing on the problems of dressing in the urban environment. The Supermodern Wardrobe, as the show is called, is more than a rundown of utility style; it looks ahead to what we might be wearing in the future. People move around more, need more from their clothing. Fashion needs not only to fulfil its traditional role of making us look good and incidentally protecting us from the elements, but also kitting us out for the environment created by the city. \"Supermodern is a term borrowed from the French sociologist Marc Aug\u00e9, who used it to describe the late capitalist condition,\" says the curator Andrew Bolton. \"It's all about excessive information, urban spaces now being within a few hours of one another. A prime example is the internet. You've got so much to think about in your daily lives - these clothes are about simplifying choices.\"</p> <p>So, multipurpose garments are no longer an eccentric's fantasy - or Heath Robinson for fashion victims - but an inspiring and possibly profitable new direction for designers. The versatility of this clothing increases options for the wearer's appearance, but reduces the number of clothes needed. Issey Miyake devoted a substantial part of its autumn/winter 2000 collection to this theme, including Transformer jackets with bolt-on anoraks that can be worn over them, and Film Lining jackets that reverse to a waterproof option. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art fabrics have made their way out of the camping shop and into the collections of hip, small labels such as Vexed Generation; and accessorised clothing has moved on from the days of workwear trousers with a handy strap for your chisel, to jackets containing micro-computers - smart in every sense.</p> <p>Recently, there was the launch of Levi's ICD+, a collaboration between the clothing manufacturer, electronics giant Philips, and designer Maaimo Osti. \"We needed to examine what people need from workwear today,\" said Levi's Peter Ingwersen. \"We identified a group we call nomads, who are constantly on the move, always in taxis or airports and need to be wired.\" The results are jackets with voice-recognition mobile phones and MP3 players, a microphone in the collar and earphones built into the hood; the jackets are machine washable, but the electronics click out before you put them in the machine.</p> <p>Typical features of so-called \"intelligent\" clothing (or I-wear as it is dubbed in the industry) include hoods and pollution masks; colours tend to be blacks, greys and duns - camouflage for the alienating city street - and fabrics decidedly functional, often driven by military research. Vexed Generation has been exploring such themes since it began in 1994. Tucked away in a covered Soho alley, an open door leads you, unannounced, anonymous, up a spiral staircase to the first-floor showroom where a crowd of faceless mannequins display the company's most recent work.</p> <p>\"When we started, we were on the dole and wanted to make London street wear,\" says Adam Thorpe, one half of Vexed Generation. \"We ride scooters and push bikes, we're interested in going out ... There was increasing surveillance, so we had hoods that hid your identity.\" So they came up with their Parka, a menacing \"parody of riot gear\" into whose hood the wearer's face would almost disappear. It was at the time that the Criminal Justice Act was being introduced, so the Parka highlighted issues of civil liberties and CCTV. Made from ballistic nylon originally developed for the Ministry of Defence, it is one of their signature pieces, a variation of which they continue to make.</p> <p>Today, Thorpe and his partner Joe Hunter are \"still on two-wheels but don't want to be in full battledress all the time\". Their latest collection includes more tailored clothing such as the A4 Crombie, smart enough to wear to the office, but with a hood concealed in the collar. \"It is not as in-your-face or confrontational as they used to be, but perhaps the times are not as in-your-face and confrontational.

The idea, explains founder and designer Hardy Blechman, was to make hemp, a traditional clothing fabric that is more environmentally friendly than cotton, work in modern times. Due to its associations with marijuana production, hemp had slowly been replaced by cotton in the early part of the 20th century. But the latter, says Blechman, \"is very weak and needs lots of pesticides to grow properly. These environmental issues weren't considered when it was thought that people might get high as a result of growing it. It used to be quite common in English gardens that people would grow their own hemp plants and weave their own things. Underwear for winter, perhaps - a bit itchy, but okay.\"</p> <p>Thanks to a collaboration with the Italian mill ITS Aitea, Maharishi has launched the showerproof Aventail jacket, a hemp and nylon-mix garment that gives a performance element to the natural fibre. And, as well as taking the hippy out of hemp, the Aventail quenches thirst as well. \"At the back of the jacket is a pocket, and in there is a malleable water container,\" says Blechman. \"A tube goes through a series of fabric clips and pops out in front of the face, just inside the collar.\" Here, a bite valve releases the water when you need it.

Cox's 1999 collection, Pieces, uses zips, pop studs and reversible fabrics to create clothing with at least a dual function. A long-sleeved jacket becomes a sleeveless vest, a pair of shorts converts into trousers; all of it folds into its own zip-up pouch. Similarly, Mandarina Duck has the \"jackpack\", a jacket that changes into a rucksack, and CP Company's Transformables include a sleeping bag that converts into a Parka and a long, hooded cloak that becomes a tent.

      "bodyText": "Imagine - it is a cold, sunny day but the train into work will be cramped and stuffy. How much should you put on? What if the weather turns nasty all of a sudden: a heavy shower when it was such a promising start? Will it mean sitting all morning in the office with the uncomfortable feeling of your skirt or trousers drying against your skin? Urban workers, who spend their lives partly in conditions of artificial heating and air-conditioning, partly subject to the whim of the weather, will pass through several environments in one day. Each time, they will want different things from their clothing - that's before they they even consider the gym at lunchtime or what to wear for a social date after work. In the city context, the traditional rules of spring, summer, autumn and winter are becoming less important. In their place is a fifth season of the controlled urban environment, where the old climate rules no longer apply. Let no one say that fashion is all fluff and nonsense, never responding to the consumer's needs. On the evidence of a new exhibition organised jointly by the London College of Fashion and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, designers - from Issey Miyake and Hussein Chalayan to relative unknowns - are increasingly focusing on the problems of dressing in the urban environment. The Supermodern Wardrobe, as the show is called, is more than a rundown of utility style; it looks ahead to what we might be wearing in the future. People move around more, need more from their clothing. Fashion needs not only to fulfil its traditional role of making us look good and incidentally protecting us from the elements, but also kitting us out for the environment created by the city. \"Supermodern is a term borrowed from the French sociologist Marc Aug\u00e9, who used it to describe the late capitalist condition,\" says the curator Andrew Bolton. \"It's all about excessive information, urban spaces now being within a few hours of one another. A prime example is the internet. You've got so much to think about in your daily lives - these clothes are about simplifying choices.\" So, multipurpose garments are no longer an eccentric's fantasy - or Heath Robinson for fashion victims - but an inspiring and possibly profitable new direction for designers. The versatility of this clothing increases options for the wearer's appearance, but reduces the number of clothes needed. Issey Miyake devoted a substantial part of its autumn/winter 2000 collection to this theme, including Transformer jackets with bolt-on anoraks that can be worn over them, and Film Lining jackets that reverse to a waterproof option. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art fabrics have made their way out of the camping shop and into the collections of hip, small labels such as Vexed Generation; and accessorised clothing has moved on from the days of workwear trousers with a handy strap for your chisel, to jackets containing micro-computers - smart in every sense. Recently, there was the launch of Levi's ICD+, a collaboration between the clothing manufacturer, electronics giant Philips, and designer Maaimo Osti. \"We needed to examine what people need from workwear today,\" said Levi's Peter Ingwersen. \"We identified a group we call nomads, who are constantly on the move, always in taxis or airports and need to be wired.\" The results are jackets with voice-recognition mobile phones and MP3 players, a microphone in the collar and earphones built into the hood; the jackets are machine washable, but the electronics click out before you put them in the machine. Typical features of so-called \"intelligent\" clothing (or I-wear as it is dubbed in the industry) include hoods and pollution masks; colours tend to be blacks, greys and duns - camouflage for the alienating city street - and fabrics decidedly functional, often driven by military research. Vexed Generation has been exploring such themes since it began in 1994. Tucked away in a covered Soho alley, an open door leads you, unannounced, anonymous, up a spiral staircase to the first-floor showroom where a crowd of faceless mannequins display the company's most recent work. \"When we started, we were on the dole and wanted to make London street wear,\" says Adam Thorpe, one half of Vexed Generation. \"We ride scooters and push bikes, we're interested in going out ... There was increasing surveillance, so we had hoods that hid your identity.\" So they came up with their Parka, a menacing \"parody of riot gear\" into whose hood the wearer's face would almost disappear. It was at the time that the Criminal Justice Act was being introduced, so the Parka highlighted issues of civil liberties and CCTV. Made from ballistic nylon originally developed for the Ministry of Defence, it is one of their signature pieces, a variation of which they continue to make. Today, Thorpe and his partner Joe Hunter are \"still on two-wheels but don't want to be in full battledress all the time\". Their latest collection includes more tailored clothing such as the A4 Crombie, smart enough to wear to the office, but with a hood concealed in the collar. \"It is not as in-your-face or confrontational as they used to be, but perhaps the times are not as in-your-face and confrontational. Whereas before you were definitely scaring old ladies in the street, now you have the option to scare old ladies in the street.\" It is Vexed's use of hi-tech fabrics that really sets their clothes apart - at a glance some of the designs might not look that different from utility offerings on the high street. But talk to Thorpe and Hunter, and it is like having a chemistry lesson. They know as much about molecules and endothermic reactions as they do about pleats, lines and tucks.

Or you could take that overheated train on a cold day. The real magic of this jacket is the \"phase change\" technology used in the lining, a textile originally developed for Nasa.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives yesterday confessed to making mistakes when they privatised the rail industry. The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, and the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo - a transport minister well before privatisation - admitted errors had been made and that there would have to be changes. Their comments came after Railtrack's chief executive, Gerald Corbett, claimed that the railway had been \"ripped apart at privatisation\", with the resulting structure designed to maximise the proceeds to the Treasury. Reiterating his position on Radio 4's Today programme, he recommended fewer train companies and attacked the \"years and years of underinvestment and the fragmentation created at privatisation, plus a 25% increase in the number of trains\". Mr Jenkin said: \"Gerald Corbett is right that the system was made into too many different companies.\" The privatisation process, completed when Railtrack was floated in May 1996, broke British Rail into 25 train operating companies, four rolling stock companies and Railtrack. While rejecting the idea that the government should \"turn the clock back\" by ending privatisation, Mr Jenkin added: \"I agree wholeheartedly with Gerald's comment that we need a change in the way the railway is run, and that is aimed at everybody involved: at the industry, the regulator, who has been very legalistic and adversarial in the last years, and the government.\" Mr Portillo conceded: \"I dare say some mistakes were made\" during privatisation. In an increasingly tense exchange, he appeared to distance himself from the decision to go ahead with the scheme, demanding that the programme \"admit it made a mistake\" in describing him as transport minister in the mid-1990s, when privatisation began, and insisting four times that he was a minister in the department \"many years before\" the process went ahead. While privatisation did not start until four years after Mr Portillo left his transport post in 1990, he was involved in initial discussions, and later, as Treasury chief secretary, pushed for the break-up of BR with the then transport secretary, John MacGregor. As Mr Portillo backed Mr Jenkin's call for changes to the structure of the privatised railways, a former Tory transport minister, Peter Bottomley, defended the system: \"These crashes are unacceptable, but the overall picture is one of benefits to passengers, benefits to railways, fewer people on the roads and fewer deaths.\" But Don Foster, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, accused the Tories of performing a u-turn and described Mr Jenkin as \"a repenting sinner [to] be applauded\". He added: \"The foreseeable problems were ignored by the Conservatives at the time of privatisation.\" Labour refused to be drawn into a row, but a source at the Department of Transport said: \"It's nice to see they've now acknowledged that privatisation caused some of the problems we have been trying to put right.\"",

      "body": "<p>AltaVista's chief executive, Rod Schrock, has resigned just months before the internet search service was expected to list on the US stock market. </p> <p>The timing of Mr Schrock's departure, to spend more time with his family, has raised further questions among analysts about the company's already postponed plans to go public. The search for a new chief executive could take months. </p> <p>Mr Schrock's resignation comes after a difficult year for AltaVista, which is controlled by CMGI, the internet investment company.

      "bodyText": "AltaVista's chief executive, Rod Schrock, has resigned just months before the internet search service was expected to list on the US stock market. The timing of Mr Schrock's departure, to spend more time with his family, has raised further questions among analysts about the company's already postponed plans to go public. The search for a new chief executive could take months. Mr Schrock's resignation comes after a difficult year for AltaVista, which is controlled by CMGI, the internet investment company. AltaVista began a $120m marketing campaign almost exactly a year ago, aiming to compete with web portals such as Yahoo! Soon after, AltaVista filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq composite index but these plans were shelved in April as the market for new technology issues disappeared.

The auctioneers will arrive early and, if the weather is fine, about 500 people are expected to pick their way round the site, which has been in the Tranter family for 62 years.</p> <p>Up on the hill they will cast their eye over a line of tools and equipment, a roller, tractor, cement mixer, muck spreader and dozens of other items for sale. Then they will look at the 125 Holstein Friesian cows, all washed with their tails trimmed.</p> <p>Mr Tranter is getting out of dairy. His 240-acre farm, Croeslace, in Raglan, Monmouthshire, is making no money, and he is too tired to go on working for nothing. Like many other farmers he is now making less money than the cost of his production. His son, Gwyn, who used to work on the farm, had to be laid off last year.</p> <p>Last night was the last time Mr Tranter herded his cows into his milk parlour, the last time he secured the suction pumps to their teats and the last time he watched and listened as the white milk was drawn out of the udders and up into the seven-gallon glass containers suspended from the ceiling.</p> <p>Mr Tranter began milking at the age of eight, and every morning since he was about 15 he has got up at five to milk the cows. He usually finished the day's work only after the second milking at 7.30pm. Last night this final milking was tinged with relief as well as regret.</p> <p>Mr Tranter and his wife, Margaret, are tenant farmers. They have no equity, but they have no debts and feel that if they do not sell now they will be caught in an impossible spiral. To them their industry is in freefall, and they cannot see an end to the decline. So they are selling everything.</p> <p>Farming income is at its lowest since the 1930s. A report last week by the accountants Deloitte and Touche said that farmers' earnings had dropped by 90% in the past five years and that many farms were expected to make a loss of \u00a34,000 next year. In the 12 months to June last year the industry shed 22,000 jobs.</p> <p>Last week Mr Tranter, his two brothers and some neighbours were sprucing up the farm. A contractor was picking up steaming piles of hay and dumping them into a trailer on the back of Mr Tranter's tractor. Between dropping off the dirty hay and bringing back fresh bales he said: \"Since my boy left me I haven't taken a wage. I never work much under 100 hours a week, and I am now feeling: why should I work 100 hours a week for nothing?</p> <p>\"Five years ago my cows were worth \u00a31,000 a head. At today's prices they might average \u00a3450. Half the calves born to British dairy men are knocked on the head or sold to a local kennels or the knacker man or whatever you want to call it.</p> <p>\"The way it's gone for the last five years, the more work you do the less money you seem to get. There is nothing better than getting up on a nice day and getting your cows in and knowing they are yours. But it hasn't been so good getting them in and milking them and getting nothing for it.\"</p> <p>Mrs Tranter was trying not to be too upset by the frenetic preparation for the sale. \"It's not so bad - because there's no future in farming. Perhaps it's just as well to get out when we can,\" she said. \"But oh God, it's heartbreaking.\"</p> <p>Mr Tranter's mother, Lillian Maude, 84, was making tomato and onion chutney in the farm kitchen. \"I feel very sad and sorry; I have had seven children here.\" She shook her head then smiled at the painter hanging through the windowframe - the landlord was having the house painted for the new owner.</p> <p>The price of milk - it has dropped at least 9p a litre since 1995 - and the BSE crisis have turned the once wealthy tradition into one of penury for many, but it is not just tenant farmers such as Mr Tranter who are badly hit.</p> <p>Across the valley, his cousin, Brian Parry, is dealing with the crisis in a different way.

      "bodyText": "Wyndham Tranter's farm is to be sold this morning. The auctioneers will arrive early and, if the weather is fine, about 500 people are expected to pick their way round the site, which has been in the Tranter family for 62 years. Up on the hill they will cast their eye over a line of tools and equipment, a roller, tractor, cement mixer, muck spreader and dozens of other items for sale. Then they will look at the 125 Holstein Friesian cows, all washed with their tails trimmed. Mr Tranter is getting out of dairy. His 240-acre farm, Croeslace, in Raglan, Monmouthshire, is making no money, and he is too tired to go on working for nothing. Like many other farmers he is now making less money than the cost of his production. His son, Gwyn, who used to work on the farm, had to be laid off last year. Last night was the last time Mr Tranter herded his cows into his milk parlour, the last time he secured the suction pumps to their teats and the last time he watched and listened as the white milk was drawn out of the udders and up into the seven-gallon glass containers suspended from the ceiling. Mr Tranter began milking at the age of eight, and every morning since he was about 15 he has got up at five to milk the cows. He usually finished the day's work only after the second milking at 7.30pm. Last night this final milking was tinged with relief as well as regret. Mr Tranter and his wife, Margaret, are tenant farmers. They have no equity, but they have no debts and feel that if they do not sell now they will be caught in an impossible spiral. To them their industry is in freefall, and they cannot see an end to the decline. So they are selling everything. Farming income is at its lowest since the 1930s. A report last week by the accountants Deloitte and Touche said that farmers' earnings had dropped by 90% in the past five years and that many farms were expected to make a loss of \u00a34,000 next year. In the 12 months to June last year the industry shed 22,000 jobs. Last week Mr Tranter, his two brothers and some neighbours were sprucing up the farm. A contractor was picking up steaming piles of hay and dumping them into a trailer on the back of Mr Tranter's tractor. Between dropping off the dirty hay and bringing back fresh bales he said: \"Since my boy left me I haven't taken a wage. I never work much under 100 hours a week, and I am now feeling: why should I work 100 hours a week for nothing? \"Five years ago my cows were worth \u00a31,000 a head. At today's prices they might average \u00a3450. Half the calves born to British dairy men are knocked on the head or sold to a local kennels or the knacker man or whatever you want to call it. \"The way it's gone for the last five years, the more work you do the less money you seem to get. There is nothing better than getting up on a nice day and getting your cows in and knowing they are yours. But it hasn't been so good getting them in and milking them and getting nothing for it.\" Mrs Tranter was trying not to be too upset by the frenetic preparation for the sale. \"It's not so bad - because there's no future in farming. Perhaps it's just as well to get out when we can,\" she said. \"But oh God, it's heartbreaking.\" Mr Tranter's mother, Lillian Maude, 84, was making tomato and onion chutney in the farm kitchen. \"I feel very sad and sorry; I have had seven children here.\" She shook her head then smiled at the painter hanging through the windowframe - the landlord was having the house painted for the new owner. The price of milk - it has dropped at least 9p a litre since 1995 - and the BSE crisis have turned the once wealthy tradition into one of penury for many, but it is not just tenant farmers such as Mr Tranter who are badly hit. Across the valley, his cousin, Brian Parry, is dealing with the crisis in a different way. He said he was borrowing money from the bank on the farm. \"Everybody who is still in the business is borrowing more and hoping that it will come right. You just keep extending your overdraft.\" Mr Parry is clearly holding out hope, but what for? \"Tomorrow,\" he replied with a laugh. \"I am waiting to be paid the proper rate for the job. What we are hoping for is for the value of the euro to change and for the price of diesel to come down.\" Raglan is in a less-favoured area, but farmers such as Mr Tranter and Mr Parry get very little subsidy. In March 50 farmers from the area dumped thousands of gallons of milk in a field in protest at milk prices. They are set to get a 1p increase next year. The discontent is not just in dairy farming. Not far away, at Nantycarrow farm, John and Elsie Harris are scaling down their beef and sheep farm. Their son Cliff runs the farm now but mostly works out on his JCBs because there is not enough money on the farm, and Mrs Harris, 72, has been doing a lot of the work. Cliff Harris is giving up the tenancy that has been in the family since 1946. Things are getting so bad that he recently stumbled across people trying to steal his diesel in the night. Mrs Harris said: \"I think giving up is the best thing my son could do. It will, though, be the end of a family tradition.\" Ian Williams, a dairy and arable farmer who has diversified into turkeys, has felt the pinch so much he has embarked on a catering course one day a week. \"I can't sell a tonne of corn for the price of a pair of shoes for one of my children,\" he said. \"I diversified, but there isn't a good enterprise because nothing is doing well. Before, when the milk price was down, then the turkeys were doing well or the arable was. In the past, to have a mixed farm was a safer bet, but it's not now.\" His wife, Helen, pointed out that there is no redundancy for farmers. For tenant farmers like her and her husband there is no home if they give up the farm As they discuss this crisis over a pint in a Raglan bar, the farmers say they are aware that to the metropolitan populace they are over-subsidised whingers. But they say that the maxim, there is no such thing as a poor farmer, is long dead. Rhys Parry, a beef and sheep farmer, said: \"I am not making any money at all.

She said the feeling of the surgeon's hand removing the afterbirth from her womb was like \"being hit in the stomach with a sledgehammer.\" She said: \"I felt terrified, absolutely terrified.\" When the surgeon, Prosenjit Sarker, shouted at Dr Evans-Appiah to make her unconscious, saying, \"get her out, now\", the anaesthetist made another blunder described by GMC counsel Rebecca Poulet QC as \"a shocking illustration of professional standards\". He picked up from the floor of the theatre a piece of surgical equipment that is used to steer tubes into a patient's throat, which he had dropped. Then he wiped it on his trousers and licked it before putting it into Mrs Woolger's mouth.",

From each military document he reads the names and ranks of everyone on the document is addressed to as if trying to protect himself with the correctness of the military language: \"This document,\" he began at yesterday's hearing \"was sent to the following: Chief of Staff, Head of Strategy, Chief of Staff of East of Bosnian Corps; the General Assistant Commander for Moral, Religious and Legal Affairs...\" Judge Almiro Rodrigues interrupted to tell the general's lawyer that such a litany was not necessary. Gen Krstic seemed most comfortable when he struggled to his feet - his leg was injured by shellfire eight years ago - and pointed with his silver general's stick at the mountain roads he travelled during the massacre; where he assures us he was utterly out of touch with his soldiers, other commanders or indeed anyone who could tell him anything about the murder of 7,500 men a few miles away. The trial continues and will continue for months. Justice at the Hague is slow - but thorough.",

      "body": "<p>General Motors, the world's largest car manufacturer, is planning to launch a mobile phone service in Britain within the next few months. </p> <p>The concept has grown out of the US group's increasing involvement with telematics in its vehicles. </p> <p>But the new service will go beyond car buyers. It will also be aimed at the general public, according to industry sources. </p> <p>The new business, which will be run by GM Europe, will buy capacity from one of Britain's four mobile phone network operators. It will be marketed under a separate brand name. </p> <p>GM has identified the provision of mobile phone and mobile internet services as an opportunity to expand in an area unconnected with its core car interests. </p> <p>It has recruited a number of senior executives from the mobile phone industry, including a former head of strategy at Orange. </p> <p>GM wants to set up its new business as a \"virtual mobile network operator\", similar to Virgin Mobile, a joint venture between Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and network operator One2One. Virgin Mobile gives the impression of being a network operator, with its own call centre, tariff structure and billing arrangements. In fact it uses One2One's network and facilities. </p> <p>Two of Britain's leading retail chains this week announced virtual mobile phone networks.

      "bodyText": "General Motors, the world's largest car manufacturer, is planning to launch a mobile phone service in Britain within the next few months. The concept has grown out of the US group's increasing involvement with telematics in its vehicles. But the new service will go beyond car buyers. It will also be aimed at the general public, according to industry sources. The new business, which will be run by GM Europe, will buy capacity from one of Britain's four mobile phone network operators. It will be marketed under a separate brand name. GM has identified the provision of mobile phone and mobile internet services as an opportunity to expand in an area unconnected with its core car interests. It has recruited a number of senior executives from the mobile phone industry, including a former head of strategy at Orange. GM wants to set up its new business as a \"virtual mobile network operator\", similar to Virgin Mobile, a joint venture between Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and network operator One2One. Virgin Mobile gives the impression of being a network operator, with its own call centre, tariff structure and billing arrangements. In fact it uses One2One's network and facilities. Two of Britain's leading retail chains this week announced virtual mobile phone networks. Tesco launched its service yesterday, only two days after a similar move by Sainsbury's. GM officials would not comment on their new venture. One2One, which is thought to be its most likely partner, also refused to comment. General Motors has been involved in car-based mobile communications through its OnStar telematics business, largely in the US and Germany. The OnStar voice-activated service enables drivers to make and receive phone calls, e-mails and limited internet information. It accounts for about half the telematic systems fitted in cars in the US. Ford, the second largest car maker after GM, previewed its latest telematic system earlier this week at a Detroit conference on car electronics. The Ford system will let car drivers and passengers \"plug and play\" a wide range of electronic devices, including lap top computers, navigation systems, games consoles and DVD players. A Ford spokesman said the new interface would allow the company to provide state-of-the-art electronic packages to its customers more quickly. \"We call the interface the 'customer convenience port' because it allows our customers to bring popular consumer products into the car,\" he said. As cars become more alike in performance, the motor industry is looking to in-car electronics as a way of differentiating their products - and increasing their profitability. It has been portraying hands-off voice controlled devices as safety features, enabling the driver to keep his hands firmly on the wheel. But research papers presented at the Detroit conference claimed that the new electronic gadgets are additional distractions for drivers and are likely to trigger rather than prevent accidents. Distraction has long been cited as one of the biggest single causes of road accidents. In a paper presented to the conference yesterday, Paul Green, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan transportation research institute, claimed that a significant number of road deaths had been caused \"by distraction due to technology\".",

After an acrimonious battle with rival bidder Punch Taverns, Whitbread's offer was foiled by the office of fair trading. </p> <p>Since then, Whitbread appears to have executed a screeching U-turn - Mr Thomas has ditched the company's liquid heritage by selling its brewing and off-licence businesses.

Britons are moving homes and jobs more often, which means fewer people become \"regulars\" at neighbourhood pubs. </p> <p>Whitbread's challenge is to convince the City that other hospitality activities - restaurants and hotels - offer more excitement. </p> <p>Mr Thomas points out that just a third of food in Britain is consumed outside the home, against 50% in the United States.

      "body": "<p>When Nigeria's former dictator General Sani Abacha received a dozen or so zipped and padlocked bags full of cash from the central bank in his bedroom on 30 September 1996, he probably thought that the $50m and \u00a320m they contained would be safer in secrecy-obsessed Switzerland than in Britain. </p> <p>The money was only a small part of the cash allegedly looted from the Nigerian economy. Evidence gathered by Swiss and Nigerian investigators indicates that some $2.2bn left the country between 1993 and 1998 through a complex web of international business and banking transactions. But this is just one of the starting points for a money trail that leads not only to traditional havens like Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, which at the time had ironclad banking secrecy laws, but also mainstream financial centres like Britain and the US. </p> <p>Four years later, after Abacha's death and the return of an elected civilian government in 1999, the Swiss have frozen some $660m in bank accounts held by Abacha's family and his associates, returned $60m to Nigeria's new government, while a magistrate is pressing charges of money laundering against the late dictator's son, Mohamed, and several others. </p> <p>The investigating magistrate, George Zecchin, is said to have asked Britain for legal assistance. The Home Office has not blocked any assets for four months despite mounting evidence that an estimated $450m was held in banks based in Britain, according to lawyers acting for the Nigerian government. The Nigerian authorities formally asked the Home Office to freeze about 30 accounts in 10 banks based in Britain in July. The move followed weeks of negotiations between their lawyers and British officials on the best way to proceed. The Home Office yesterday defended the delay in following up the request. A spokeswoman said that a lengthy legal process, similar to the one for extradition demands, had to be completed before a final decision could be made. </p> <p>The Abacha case is governed by a bilateral assets confiscation agreement drawn up between Britain and Nigeria in 1993. This says that: </p> <p>\u0095Assets of an individual can only be frozen in Britain if the Nigerian authorities have brought, or are about to bring, charges against the individual. A certificate has to be presented as confirmation; </p> <p>\u0095Nigeria has to present legally binding evidence linking the individual to the assets. </p> <p>The spokeswoman pointed out that the government was examining ways of streamlining the procedure to prevent cases from \"dragging on\".\"The burden of proof must still be the same,\" the spokeswoman said. \"But improvements can be made and red tape can be cut.\" </p> <p>Switzerland, Jersey, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, have blocked about $1.5bn in accounts thought to be linked to the Abachas. The apparent procedural hold-up in Britain stands out. Without evidence from London, the investigators fear the international paper trail will be broken. \"Britain is not bad normally, at least from a court point of view. It has become much more difficult in countries with written constitutions which have privacy provisions,\" said David Greene, a London solicitor specializing in asset tracing. \"In such cases speed and secrecy is so highly important. You've got to be able to latch on the paper trail.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Nigeria's former dictator General Sani Abacha received a dozen or so zipped and padlocked bags full of cash from the central bank in his bedroom on 30 September 1996, he probably thought that the $50m and \u00a320m they contained would be safer in secrecy-obsessed Switzerland than in Britain. The money was only a small part of the cash allegedly looted from the Nigerian economy. Evidence gathered by Swiss and Nigerian investigators indicates that some $2.2bn left the country between 1993 and 1998 through a complex web of international business and banking transactions. But this is just one of the starting points for a money trail that leads not only to traditional havens like Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, which at the time had ironclad banking secrecy laws, but also mainstream financial centres like Britain and the US. Four years later, after Abacha's death and the return of an elected civilian government in 1999, the Swiss have frozen some $660m in bank accounts held by Abacha's family and his associates, returned $60m to Nigeria's new government, while a magistrate is pressing charges of money laundering against the late dictator's son, Mohamed, and several others. The investigating magistrate, George Zecchin, is said to have asked Britain for legal assistance. The Home Office has not blocked any assets for four months despite mounting evidence that an estimated $450m was held in banks based in Britain, according to lawyers acting for the Nigerian government. The Nigerian authorities formally asked the Home Office to freeze about 30 accounts in 10 banks based in Britain in July. The move followed weeks of negotiations between their lawyers and British officials on the best way to proceed. The Home Office yesterday defended the delay in following up the request. A spokeswoman said that a lengthy legal process, similar to the one for extradition demands, had to be completed before a final decision could be made. The Abacha case is governed by a bilateral assets confiscation agreement drawn up between Britain and Nigeria in 1993. This says that: \u0095Assets of an individual can only be frozen in Britain if the Nigerian authorities have brought, or are about to bring, charges against the individual. A certificate has to be presented as confirmation; \u0095Nigeria has to present legally binding evidence linking the individual to the assets. The spokeswoman pointed out that the government was examining ways of streamlining the procedure to prevent cases from \"dragging on\".\"The burden of proof must still be the same,\" the spokeswoman said. \"But improvements can be made and red tape can be cut.\" Switzerland, Jersey, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, have blocked about $1.5bn in accounts thought to be linked to the Abachas. The apparent procedural hold-up in Britain stands out. Without evidence from London, the investigators fear the international paper trail will be broken. \"Britain is not bad normally, at least from a court point of view. It has become much more difficult in countries with written constitutions which have privacy provisions,\" said David Greene, a London solicitor specializing in asset tracing. \"In such cases speed and secrecy is so highly important. You've got to be able to latch on the paper trail.\"",

Among the dead were 22 troops on board a helicopter gunship which crashed after coming under fire. The US-made Blackhawk helicopter crashed on Thursday in an isolated jungle region as it ferried reinforcements to a town under attack from around 500 guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). The Colombian air force chief, General Hector Fabio Velasco, said that the helicopter went down after its tail rotor grazed a hill, but he acknowledged that the Blackhawk had come under ground fire moments before the accident. Thirty-two troops, two police officers and an unknown number of rebels died in heavy fighting around the town of Dabeiba, 230 miles north-west of Bogota, which has been besieged since Wednesday. Dabeiba lies on a key arms- and drugs-smuggling route linking the Panamanian border with central Colombia. Meanwhile, the whereabouts of at least 47 police officers remains unknown. It is feared they were either killed by the Farc or taken prisoner. Earlier this year, President Bill Clinton approved a $1.3bn (\u00a3900m) aid package for Colombia, which included up to 60 attack helicopters to support a military offensive targeting narcotics installations and the rebels who Colombian officials say profit from the drugs trade. Military sources say that the Farc does not posses anti-aircraft weapons, but last year the rebels downed a police helicopter with heavy machine-gun fire. The Farc routinely attacks rural police posts in overwhelming numbers, peppering them with homemade missiles, and either killing the outgunned officers or taking them prisoner. The surge in fighting comes ahead of nationwide local elections October 29, which rebels and rightwing paramilitary groups might try to disrupt.",

      "body": "<p>These are the statistics. As of midday yesterday, the slaughter now engulfing Israel and the Palestinians had left 111 dead and so many wounded that the hospitals have lost count - perhaps more than 3,000.</p> <p>For the outside world, the slaughter has just one face: Mohammed al-Direh, the 12-year-old boy who died three weeks ago in his father's arms after coming under Israel fire for 40 minutes. It was a death recorded in horrifying detail by a Palestinian cameraman.</p> <p>Those pictures led to widespread condemnation of Israel for excessive use of force against stone-throwing Palestinians.</p> <p>They also propelled thousands of Palestinian youths - including citizens of the Jewish state living inside Israel's borders - to join the violent protests. Since Mohammed's death on September 29 scores more have died. Here are five of them.</p> <p><b> Sara al-Haq </b><br></p> <p>At the family home in Kusra, an isolated village near the West Bank city of Nablus, there is a poster of a proud father holding a pretty two-year-old girl. The gunsight superimposed in red ink over her copper-coloured curls is not immediately apparent.</p> <p>On the afternoon of October 1, Sara was running a temperature, and the girl described by her family as a little chatterbox was quiet and listless. So her father, Abid al-Azeem Abdul al-Haq, left his potter's workshop early to take her to a doctor in Nablus.</p> <p>He found total confusion: roadblocks and scores of Israeli soldiers with heavy armour. Three hospitals turned him away as they struggled to cope with incoming wounded. \"I was ashamed. There were a lot of wounded and I was just coming with a small girl running a temperature,\" her father said. It was well past 8pm, and dark when Mr al-Haq returned home with Sara in the back seat of his car cradled in the arms of her aunt, Reema Rabia. As he approached his village, he noticed a car idling by the side of the road. Mr al-Haq slowed down, and then sped up when he saw the car had yellow plates - which meant that it was an Israeli vehicle, possibly owned by settlers from the nearby Jewish settlement of Migdalim. There were two men in the back seat wearing skullcaps.</p> <p>As he overtook, the two men opened fire. The aunt grabbed Sara and lay down. Then she screamed that she had been shot.</p> <p>The child made no sound. Mr al-Haq did not stop driving until he reached the safety of his village. When he opened the car, Sara was in the well between the seats. Her brain had fallen out of her head.</p> <p>There were eight bullet holes in the car. Mr al-Haq says the settlers used to be welcome in the village. But he doubts they can live together now.</p> <p>\"I believe the mentality of the Jews is like the wild west with cowboys and Indians. They believe the guy with the biggest weapon is the king,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The guy who shot at our car did not want to kill me, or Sara, or Reema, or even Yasser Arafat. He just wanted to kill any Arab.\"</p> <p>Thirteen children have been killed in the violence, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. But they do not include Sara. That is because the organisation is still investigating contradictory claims by the Israeli army that she was killed by her own father when he was cleaning his gun inside the house, or that he opened fire on the settlers first.</p> <p>Kusra lies in a part of the West Bank that remains under Israeli security and administrative control. Mr al-Haq did not clean his daughter's blood off the red Renault for several days after her death, expecting the Israeli military or police to arrive to begin gathering evidence.</p> <p>No one came.</p> <p>\"Mohammed al-Direh was lucky because one of the journalists recorded the minute when he was killed. Sara was not,\" said her father.</p> <p><b> Khalil Lawrence </b><br></p> <p>A member of Yasser Arafat's praetorian guard, Force 17, Khalil Lawrence was the bearer of two historic legacies. His grandfather fought with Lawrence of Arabia, and so when he had a son he named him after his British hero.</p> <p>Lawrence Khalil Badar's name was prophetic. He spent 26 years inside Israeli jails, dying in Beer Sheva prison five months ago, one year short of finishing a sentence for guerrilla attacks against Israel.</p> <p>Khalil Lawrence, aged 25, had not been born when Badar was sent to jail and his relationship with his father was confined to 45-minute visits once a month.</p> <p>His village, Beit Dukko, about 8 miles from Jerusalem's city centre, united to bring him up as their own. His mother, Amna Hussain, who had no other children, says neighbours offered financial help and showered the young Khalil with sweets. They told him stories of his father's bravery.</p> <p>When self-rule arrived in Israeli-occupied territories, Khalil's choice of career was inevitable. He joined the Palestinian security forces in 1995. In the early hours of October 12 Khalil was killed in a gun battle with Israeli security forces outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Thousands took part in the funeral procession in an event that became crucial to the history of the last three weeks.</p> <p>Before Khalil could be buried, scores of mourners had hacked and burned to death two Israeli reservists. His mother is too torn by grief for her husband and son to feel sorry for them.</p> <p>\"I am against violence. Before Khalil died I asked him many times not to fight,\" she said.\"Now I think he was my only son and even if they kill all the Jews in the world it will not be enough for me.\"</p> <p><b> Yossi Tabaje </b><br></p> <p>There were nine brothers in Binyamin Tabaje's family, which came from the Ethiopian city of Gondal. Four died at home of hunger and disease, and one on the long trek to Israel.</p> <p>Now there are three. The latest catastrophe to hit the Tabajes came on September 29, when Yossi, aged 26, a lieutenant in Israel's border police, was on patrol near the town of Qalqilya, which lies on the western fringes of the West Bank.</p> <p>By his brother Binyamin's account, Tabaje was ambitious. He enlisted in the army in the hope that it would help him get into university. He was garrulous and, as Binyamin warned him dozens of times, too quick to make friends.</p> <p>On the morning of his death he had stopped to take a drink and offered a sip to the Palestinian security forces who were travelling with him on the joint patrol. As his fellow officer watched in stunned silence, a Palestinian opened fire, killing Tabaje on the spot.</p> <p>The Israeli did not fire a shot and Yossi's elder brother, Binyamin Tabaje, is demanding an investigation. His killer later turned himself in to the Palestinian security forces.</p> <p>In the spice shop in the central Israeli town of Ramle where he works as a clerk, Binyamin is inconsolable. His younger brother had survived danger before, arriving in Israel as a child of 10 after trekking through Ethiopia and Sudan.</p> <p>\"We were always afraid something would happen to Yossi, but because we lost so many brothers and our mother, we thought that God would be merciful,\" said Binyamin.</p> <p>He cannot think beyond his pain and spends his days weeping over photo albums. \"I don't care at all about politics. What will be, will be. I am hurting too much to care.\"</p> <p><b> Asil Asleh </b><br></p> <p>Perhaps no death encapsulates the feelings of betrayal and despair that have engulfed Israelis - Arabs and Jews - more than that of Asil Asleh, a teenager from the Galilee village of Arabeh who was shot dead on October 2.</p> <p>Asil, aged 17, had a big smile and was the king of networkers. He was addicted to chatrooms and email, and even for a teenager spent an immoderate amount of time on the phone, building up an unheard of circle of Jewish and Arab friends.</p> <p>For four years he had been a prime mover in Seeds of Peace, an American summer programme designed to bring two segregated communities together. \"It took all his life, and his enthusiasm,\" said his father, Hassan Asleh. \"He was not just anybody in this movement, he was the motor.\"</p> <p>He is still struggling to make sense of his son's death. He says Asil, who had gone to join a local protest strike, was first beaten by Israeli forces and then shot in the head at close range after he fell to the ground. \"I am beyond anger. I am furious: first that the government is not investigating, but also at the way they are killing all of us.\"</p> <p>In the end, though, he is true to his son's ideals. \"It has been very hard in this last period, but in my opinion we have to find a way to live together. We have no choice.\"</p> <p><b> Wisam Yazbak </b><br></p> <p>The Jewish day of atonement was to have been the day of Wisam Yazbak's engagement and the Nazareth man, an Israeli Arab, had been working towards the day for months.</p> <p>He had built up a machinery firm from scratch and made enough money to buy a new villa. All he needed was his chosen bride, a nurse, also from Nazareth.</p> <p>But on October 8, when the setting sun had ushered in the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, a Jewish mob from Upper Nazareth descended on Wisam's neighbourhood, stoning houses.</p> <p>Although only 26, Wisam had some standing in the community and he joined the mayor and Israeli Arab politicians trying to cool down the situation. He was shot in the back of the head by police fire - becoming one of two Israeli Arab men to die that night.</p> <p>His mother cannot accept that the oldest of her five children is dead.</p> <p>\"She cannot believe her son was taken away. She keeps checking the door and waiting for him,\" said his uncle, Mahmoud Yazbak.</p> <p>Wisam was too much of a go-getter to take an interest in politics. But his uncle, a history professor at Haifa university, is a member of the Jewish-Arab Centre for Peace. \"I have not yet had time to think about the future. I don't know if I will leave all this, or if it will give me more power to work for co-existence between Arabs and Jews.\"</p>",

It was well past 8pm, and dark when Mr al-Haq returned home with Sara in the back seat of his car cradled in the arms of her aunt, Reema Rabia. As he approached his village, he noticed a car idling by the side of the road. Mr al-Haq slowed down, and then sped up when he saw the car had yellow plates - which meant that it was an Israeli vehicle, possibly owned by settlers from the nearby Jewish settlement of Migdalim. There were two men in the back seat wearing skullcaps. As he overtook, the two men opened fire. The aunt grabbed Sara and lay down. Then she screamed that she had been shot. The child made no sound. Mr al-Haq did not stop driving until he reached the safety of his village. When he opened the car, Sara was in the well between the seats. Her brain had fallen out of her head. There were eight bullet holes in the car. Mr al-Haq says the settlers used to be welcome in the village. But he doubts they can live together now. \"I believe the mentality of the Jews is like the wild west with cowboys and Indians. They believe the guy with the biggest weapon is the king,\" he said. \"The guy who shot at our car did not want to kill me, or Sara, or Reema, or even Yasser Arafat. He just wanted to kill any Arab.\" Thirteen children have been killed in the violence, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. But they do not include Sara. That is because the organisation is still investigating contradictory claims by the Israeli army that she was killed by her own father when he was cleaning his gun inside the house, or that he opened fire on the settlers first. Kusra lies in a part of the West Bank that remains under Israeli security and administrative control. Mr al-Haq did not clean his daughter's blood off the red Renault for several days after her death, expecting the Israeli military or police to arrive to begin gathering evidence. No one came. \"Mohammed al-Direh was lucky because one of the journalists recorded the minute when he was killed. Sara was not,\" said her father. Khalil Lawrence A member of Yasser Arafat's praetorian guard, Force 17, Khalil Lawrence was the bearer of two historic legacies. His grandfather fought with Lawrence of Arabia, and so when he had a son he named him after his British hero. Lawrence Khalil Badar's name was prophetic. He spent 26 years inside Israeli jails, dying in Beer Sheva prison five months ago, one year short of finishing a sentence for guerrilla attacks against Israel. Khalil Lawrence, aged 25, had not been born when Badar was sent to jail and his relationship with his father was confined to 45-minute visits once a month. His village, Beit Dukko, about 8 miles from Jerusalem's city centre, united to bring him up as their own. His mother, Amna Hussain, who had no other children, says neighbours offered financial help and showered the young Khalil with sweets. They told him stories of his father's bravery. When self-rule arrived in Israeli-occupied territories, Khalil's choice of career was inevitable. He joined the Palestinian security forces in 1995. In the early hours of October 12 Khalil was killed in a gun battle with Israeli security forces outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Thousands took part in the funeral procession in an event that became crucial to the history of the last three weeks. Before Khalil could be buried, scores of mourners had hacked and burned to death two Israeli reservists. His mother is too torn by grief for her husband and son to feel sorry for them. \"I am against violence. Before Khalil died I asked him many times not to fight,\" she said.\"Now I think he was my only son and even if they kill all the Jews in the world it will not be enough for me.\" Yossi Tabaje There were nine brothers in Binyamin Tabaje's family, which came from the Ethiopian city of Gondal. Four died at home of hunger and disease, and one on the long trek to Israel. Now there are three. The latest catastrophe to hit the Tabajes came on September 29, when Yossi, aged 26, a lieutenant in Israel's border police, was on patrol near the town of Qalqilya, which lies on the western fringes of the West Bank. By his brother Binyamin's account, Tabaje was ambitious. He enlisted in the army in the hope that it would help him get into university. He was garrulous and, as Binyamin warned him dozens of times, too quick to make friends. On the morning of his death he had stopped to take a drink and offered a sip to the Palestinian security forces who were travelling with him on the joint patrol. As his fellow officer watched in stunned silence, a Palestinian opened fire, killing Tabaje on the spot. The Israeli did not fire a shot and Yossi's elder brother, Binyamin Tabaje, is demanding an investigation. His killer later turned himself in to the Palestinian security forces. In the spice shop in the central Israeli town of Ramle where he works as a clerk, Binyamin is inconsolable. His younger brother had survived danger before, arriving in Israel as a child of 10 after trekking through Ethiopia and Sudan. \"We were always afraid something would happen to Yossi, but because we lost so many brothers and our mother, we thought that God would be merciful,\" said Binyamin. He cannot think beyond his pain and spends his days weeping over photo albums. \"I don't care at all about politics. What will be, will be. I am hurting too much to care.\" Asil Asleh Perhaps no death encapsulates the feelings of betrayal and despair that have engulfed Israelis - Arabs and Jews - more than that of Asil Asleh, a teenager from the Galilee village of Arabeh who was shot dead on October 2. Asil, aged 17, had a big smile and was the king of networkers. He was addicted to chatrooms and email, and even for a teenager spent an immoderate amount of time on the phone, building up an unheard of circle of Jewish and Arab friends. For four years he had been a prime mover in Seeds of Peace, an American summer programme designed to bring two segregated communities together. \"It took all his life, and his enthusiasm,\" said his father, Hassan Asleh. \"He was not just anybody in this movement, he was the motor.\" He is still struggling to make sense of his son's death. He says Asil, who had gone to join a local protest strike, was first beaten by Israeli forces and then shot in the head at close range after he fell to the ground. \"I am beyond anger. I am furious: first that the government is not investigating, but also at the way they are killing all of us.\" In the end, though, he is true to his son's ideals. \"It has been very hard in this last period, but in my opinion we have to find a way to live together. We have no choice.\" Wisam Yazbak The Jewish day of atonement was to have been the day of Wisam Yazbak's engagement and the Nazareth man, an Israeli Arab, had been working towards the day for months. He had built up a machinery firm from scratch and made enough money to buy a new villa. All he needed was his chosen bride, a nurse, also from Nazareth. But on October 8, when the setting sun had ushered in the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, a Jewish mob from Upper Nazareth descended on Wisam's neighbourhood, stoning houses. Although only 26, Wisam had some standing in the community and he joined the mayor and Israeli Arab politicians trying to cool down the situation. He was shot in the back of the head by police fire - becoming one of two Israeli Arab men to die that night. His mother cannot accept that the oldest of her five children is dead. \"She cannot believe her son was taken away. She keeps checking the door and waiting for him,\" said his uncle, Mahmoud Yazbak. Wisam was too much of a go-getter to take an interest in politics. But his uncle, a history professor at Haifa university, is a member of the Jewish-Arab Centre for Peace. \"I have not yet had time to think about the future. I don't know if I will leave all this, or if it will give me more power to work for co-existence between Arabs and Jews.\"",

      "bodyText": "Arab leftwingers and hardline Islamic groups urged Arab leaders last night to sever diplomatic relations with Israel and use their \"oil weapon\" to support the Palestinians. On the eve of an emergency summit in Cairo about 170 groups including Hizbullah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas were meeting in Beirut to show solidarity with the Palestinians. \"The conference calls on Arab countries to cut diplomatic ties with the Zionist enemy, withdraw their ambassadors, close embassies as well as trade and representative offices and halt normalisation with the Jewish enemy,\" a statement said at the end of the five-day gathering. Hizbullah, in a separate message to Arab leaders, said: \"The uprising in Palestine today does not require words of flattery and praise but an official Arab stand that matches the bloody sacrifices.\" Hizbullah urged Arab countries to open their borders to those wishing to fight the jihad (holy war) against Israel. The meeting also called on oil-rich Muslim states to allocate some revenues to support the Palestinians. Today's summit in Egypt will seek a joint stand against what Arabs see as Israel's failure to honour deals with the Palestinians and its excessive use of force to quell three weeks of protest. But disagreement has already cropped up over whether the final communique should include stiff measures against Israel or just a stern warning. The leaders are under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a moderate stance, and from their own people to avoid appearing impotent. Because of long-standing quarrels this is only the second summit that Arab leaders have dared to hold in more than 10 years. The Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy, whose attendance is uncertain, has already denounced the summit as merely \"an occasion to eat and drink\". He called on other Arab leaders to abandon the meeting. \"I want to save them from the wrath of the masses who will turn on them because, with this extraordinary summit, they will be throwing oil on the fire,\" he said. \"A summit must declare a war or an economic boycott against the enemy, but the Arabs are not capable of fighting or boycotting the enemy,\" he added. According to Egyptian sources, the most likely outcome is a freeze on all steps towards normalisation of ties with Israel, the setting up of an international tribunal to prosecute alleged Israeli war criminals and the establishment of a cash fund to help the Palestinians.",

The value of the pictures is estimated at $5m (\u00a33.5m). The verdict is expected to trigger an avalanche of claims from other, mostly Jewish, owners of artwork. Ms Nierenberg is the granddaughter of Baron Mor Herzog, a Hungarian aristocrat of Jewish background and one of the country's most famous art collectors in the first half of the 20th century.

A family representative succeeded in smuggling out some paintings and as a punishment, the state seized the rest, declaring them state property in 1954.

The decision effectively gives France the green light to try and bring Mr Gadafy to trial for \"complicity in murder in relation to a terrorist act\". Relatives of the passengers and crew on board the DC-10 of the UTA airline, which crashed over Niger en route from the Republic of Congo to Paris, launched the action against the Libyan leader after a French court last year tried six Libyans - including Col Gadafy's brother-in-law - in absentia for the bombing and sentenced them to life imprisonment. Col Gadafy would be tried for Libya's alleged role in supplying logistical aid to the bombers, protecting them after their conviction and supplying false documents during the investigation. Franco-Libyan relations began to ease last year after Tripoli paid \u00a320m to the crash victim's families in an apparent admission of responsibility. Paris considered inviting Col Gadafy to a summit of international leaders in Marseille next month. Jon Henley, Paris Dozens die in Angolan road attack Two buses and a car travelling along a rural road in Angola were set on fire, killing dozens of people, witnesses told a church broadcaster yesterday. Gunmen burned one of the buses with the passengers still inside during the attack on Wednesday at Andurie, about 75 miles east of the capital, Luanda, the Roman Catholic Radio Ecclesia reported. Police found corpses inside the bus when they arrived 12 hours later, the witnesses said. The two other vehicles were also charred. The road convoy was travelling from Luanda to N'Dalantando, the capital of the northern Kwanza Norte province, Ecclesia said. The exact number of casualties and number of unidentified gunmen were not known. The rebel group Unita, engaged in a 25-year-old war with the government, often stages hit-and-run attacks, while armed bandits roam the countryside. AP, Luanda",

      "body": "<p>Geoffrey Robinson would like us to believe he has done the government a good turn this week. The ruling clique of the New Labour cabinet, he says, has been riven with personal rivalries and political schisms since its inception and was in need of some healing. So he obliged by writing a book, The Unconventional Minister, which detailed the nature of these splits, resurrected old grievances and accused Peter Mandelson, the prime minister's closest ally, of being a conniving mischief-maker who misled the party, the House and the public. </p> <p>Robinson sold it for serialisation to the newspaper most hostile to the Labour party, the Daily Mail, which splashed his story. The rest of the press followed suit. The upshot was that the cabinet duly appeared as a sleazy, bickering, money-grabbing bunch of prima donnas. This coverage, says Robinson, will help not only the prime minister and Mandelson, but contribute to the government's stability and improve its standing in the eyes of the public. Bridges had to be built, so the Labour MP and former minister thought he would knock some down. </p> <p>\"There may be an initial reaction that will say: 'We could have done without that,' \" says Robinson. \"But I think the more mature reflection will be: 'Yes, there was a very important point Geoffrey was trying to make there, and I think we should tackle it.' \" </p> <p>If this sounds disingenuous it is because it is. It seems as though Robinson, the 62-year-old former paymaster general whose \u00a3373,000 loan to Mandelson forced both of them to resign in December 1998, just cannot help it. Every time he has opened his mouth this week in order to sound sincere, something ludicrously insincere pops out. If he says he has \"nothing but the greatest respect for Peter Mandelson\" you know he is about to trash him. When he writes: \"The public hates to see politicians squabbling and punishes divided governments,\" you know he is about to squabble in a way that will divide the government. </p> <p>He says he has not been surprised at the anti-Labour reception the book has got, but will be surprised if Labour does not benefit. \"It was never intended to be a political version of a kiss and tell,\" he says. \"The serious points I've concentrated on only after considerable and careful thought. I wanted it to be constructive, I wanted it to contribute to making the government more effective and I believe that over time it will have that impact.\" </p> <p>The serious and constructive points revealed in the Mail's serialisation include the following: Robinson was \"miffed\" that he had not been invited to Mandelson's housewarming party; Mandelson, not him, raised the issue of a loan for his house in Notting Hill at a dinner party; and Mandelson \"remains a destabilising influence between the prime minister and his chancellor\". Now Mandelson is back in government, as a minister, while Robinson remains an outcast. </p> <p>To call this revenge would be to make far too great a claim for it. By his own admission he has far more damaging material in the way of personal letters, that he says he will not release. So this is pique at its pettiest. The politics of the playground, only with far bigger stakes. It is an attempt at political assassination by biography which may well backfire. For it bears the hallmarks of the injured van ity of an insider who is now out; the conflicted allegiances of a man who has status but craves respect; the disingenuousness of a multimillionaire who thinks money makes no difference. If this is serious, you wonder what he would call trivial; if it is constructive, you wonder what he would call damaging. </p> <p>It is a contradiction inherent in the very project he himself embarked on - to settle a score in print without appearing bitter in person. \"The two main aims of what I wanted to achieve are first to counteract the impression of me that I was the sort of person who would use money to promote his own career, curry influence even to obtain a job, which seemed to be a certain element of this from the press attacks that came into this equation. I hope people can see a different person from the one they might have imagined. The second, after considerable reflecton, to raise the issue of Mandelson's role in government. From the beginning I realised how talented he is. But he must stop briefing against colleagues.\" </p> <p>The Park Room, at the Grosvenor House hotel, is an unlikely setting for the outpourings of a victim. Its windows look straight out on to Hyde Park, the furniture is plush and a cup of tea costs more than \u00a34. Upstairs single rooms go from \u00a3267 a night. This is where Geoffrey Robinson stays when he is in London. From the eighth floor, with a glorious view of Park Lane, he sits like a benevolent Master of the Universe - sipping champagne while pontificating on the plight of the poor. It is here that he used to hold \"tax and pasta parties\" with Gordon Brown and his advisers, Charlie Whelan and Ed Balls, while elaborating Labour's economic strategy for the 1997 election. </p> <p>Robinson arrives with a limp he incurred in the gym. His friendliness often threatens to break out into charm but is kept in check by his lack of candour. Just when he appears affable, a straight question: \"What should Blair do if Mandelson fails to become a team player?\" meets an evasive answer: \"I don't want to get into that\" and the bonhomie evaporates. Despite many accounts to the contrary, he maintains that Blair did not ask him to sell the New Statesman to Robert Harris and that nobody from Blair's team asked him not to publish his book. </p> <p>His penthouse is just one of many homes. Ask him how many and he will not, or cannot, give a straight answer. \"It depends how you count them I suppose. We have a little hamlet in Italy which has several buildings on it and a house here in the country. Those are our main two residences,\" he says. And the one in Cannes? \"Yes, we do have one flat in Cannes.\" So there is the Orchards, the Lutyens mansion in Godalming, Surrey; the Tuscan villa; and the bolthole on the Riviera that slipped his mind. The one place he does not have a home is in his own constituency of Coventry North West. </p> <p>Robinson came by this wealth honestly, if, at times, mysteriously. While running British Leyland's Italian car division in Milan he befriended Joska Bourgeois, a wealthy, flamboyant woman who held the Belgian Jaguar franchise. He married a Maltese-born opera singer, Marie Elena, and would later become the chief executive of Jaguar before going on to run his own business. His close relationship with Bourgeois continued. She lent him \u00a35,000 to start a small company called Transfer Technology, later renamed Transtech. By the time he became a treasury minister it was worth \u00a330m. When Bourgeois died in 1994, she left him \u00a39m and had already set up an offshore trust fund for his family in Guernsey called Orion. While there is no shortage of rumours about the reson for her generosity, nobody knows for sure and Robinson will not say. </p> <p>His wealth left him well connected. He shares a health club with Gordon Brown and Michael Barrymore, and shared a lawyer and a business with the late media tycoon, Robert Maxwell. In 1994, he acquired the New Statesman magazine. Add this to his political career and you have a heady mix. A man who cannot possibly locate the blurry line where financial influence stops and political influence begins because he lives his life on both sides at once. He twice loaned the Blair family his home in Tuscany for their summer holidays, gave a huge personal loan to Mandelson and contributed generously to the offices of both Brown and Blair, as well as former Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith. </p> <p>His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\" </p> <p>A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light? </p> <p>When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\" </p> <p> The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\" </p> <p>In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home; his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\" </p> <p>Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\" </p> <p>From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\" </p> <p>But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry. </p> <p>But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote. </p> <p>Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour; by 1997 he was on the front bench. </p> <p>It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds; over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs; the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\" </p> <p>While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\" </p> <p>Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\" </p> <p>Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk. </p>",

Add this to his political career and you have a heady mix. A man who cannot possibly locate the blurry line where financial influence stops and political influence begins because he lives his life on both sides at once. He twice loaned the Blair family his home in Tuscany for their summer holidays, gave a huge personal loan to Mandelson and contributed generously to the offices of both Brown and Blair, as well as former Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith. His generosity has left all three points of the troubled triangle of intrigue in government in his debt. It is a position that makes him simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, since it leaves a constant question mark over his access to power. Robinson, though, is one of the few people who sees no conflict of interest in dishing out huge sums of money to his boss and colleagues. \"If what you're saying is that most people would expect some quid pro quo, preferment, being courted or an honour, then all I can tell you is that that's not the way I operate. Everyone I have helped over the years will tell you that Geoffrey does not seek any thing in return for myself or my business or my family.\" A businessman who expects no return on his investment. Since he says it is so and there is no way to disprove it, then let it be so. It does not get rid of the question mark. For how would we know that those to whom he has done good turns say what they say because it is true and not because he has given them money, and they do not wish to appear ungrateful by portraying him in a bad light? When pushed, he will concede what most adults take for granted. When substantial sums of money change hands between friends, the friendship itself changes. \"I suppose that is bound to be true to some extent. The important thing is the extent of the extent. With me, I never refer to any kindness I've done. I certainly don't expect anything back. I just make it clear it was something I was able to do and that's that. That's the end of it.\" The trouble is that it is not the end of it. It is only the beginning. If ever there is an example of how wealth affects friendships then Robinson is it. Were he not in the position to lend the money to Mandelson - or be asked for it - depending on whom you believe, he would still be in government. If New Labour learns something from his experiences, the lesson has been lost on Robinson. He still insists that, if he had his time over, he would still lend Mandelson the money. \"I don't regret it all. He made a good profit on the house, so I don't suppose he does either. When we did it, it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do. Where it went wrong is that he should have declared it when he was a minister or arranged to refinance it, which I'm sure he could have done.\" In the absence of a job or public sympathy, it is down to Robinson to absolve himself. Quite where he gets this confidence from is not clear. He was born in Sheffield in 1938 and raised in Balham, south London, to working-class parents. His mother worked at home; his father - a man with taut bootstraps and entrepreneurial flair -started in a furniture shop and ended up mortgaging the family house so he could buy a furniture factory. \"Politics weren't big in the family but we were definitely Labour supporting. By background we were working class - there were no books at home, we weren't encouraged to read but play football in the winter and cricket in the summer. I was the first of the family to go to university.\" Robinson won a scholarship to a grant-maintained school, Emmanuel College. His self-assurance was not diminished by mixing with children from more cultivated backgrounds. \"We were working class culturally but by that time, my father's work was going well and we were comparatively well off. So we had a sense of being better off materially than those living close to us.\" From there, he went to Cambridge to study modern languages, and gained another scholarship to Yale. \"I met Harold Wilson and he encouraged me to come back to the Labour party so I did.\" \"The big captivating force for me was Kennedy,\" he says. \"I hadn't been active in politics at Cambridge but I got very active in the Yale in Mississippi campaign.\" This was in 1963, one of the most dangerous times in the history of the south's most redneck state. A year later, during the Mississippi Freedom Summer, three young men were murdered in cold blood, striking terror in the hearts of civil rights workers and providing the storyline for the film Mississippi Burning. A strange place and a strange time to cut your political teeth. \"Well, some of my friends were involved in it and while I had not been politically active I had always been politically and socially aware.\" But his political career has been patchy. When he came back to Britain he joined the Labour party and soon started working for it as a researcher. In 1976, he was elected as Labour MP for Coventry North West and earned a sufficiently grand reputation among the Bennite left that the late Eric Heffer suggested he should become head of the National Enterprise Board. By the early 80s, he had fallen out with the left and rose through the ranks as a spokesman on science, regional affairs and then trade and industry. But as his wealth in Transtech grew, he lost interest in politics. In 1986, he stood down as a Labour party industry spokesman. \"Nobody was taking us seriously,\" he says. \"I couldn't operate with the people I knew from industry against the background of the policies that we were going to fight the 1987 election on.\" In 1988 and 1989, he made no speeches in the House at all. In 1989 he came close to being deselected by his local party - hanging on with just 51% of the vote. Given his low profile, his rehabilitation within the party during the 90s was quite miraculous. Until the mid 90s, he was listed by Labour whips as being one of the two most difficult MPs to find to vote against the Tories. But by the end of 1996 he was back as the acceptable face of New Labour; by 1997 he was on the front bench. It is then that the various strands of his past, that had previously been of little interest to anyone, started to unravel. Questions arose over his relationship to Maxwell and the pillaged pension funds; over the offshore trust, sitting pretty in a tax haven, while Robinson oversaw a reduction in the amount that most people could save tax-free through ISAs; the accusation of fraudulent applications for department of trade and industry grants for Transtech. He was forced to apologise to the House by the Commons select committee on standards and priveleges for failing to register his interest in a company he created in 1996. The apology was five sentences long and took only 54 seconds. The next day, the Labour- supporting Express ran a front- page picture of him with the headline \"Has he no shame?\" While he had done nothing illegal, he was becoming an embarrassment to a party which had promised that the Tory years of sleaze would be replaced by an administration that was \"purer than pure\". Blair wanted him to resign but then relented \"out of deference to Gordon and me,\" says Robinson. \"Anyone else would have been out on their ear.\" Moreover, Robinson showed not only no shame, but no remorse either. \"These were acts of omission not commission,\" he says. \"There was no hidden agenda or money in brown envelopes or anything of that kind. The speech was short because there was nothing more to say because there was nothing more to apologise for.\" Then came the loan, the resignations, the bitterness and now the authored recrimination which says Robinson has done nothing wrong and Mandelson has. But Robinson got the blame and Mandelson didn't. The truth of the matter somehow seems less striking than the depths to which it has all sunk.",

      "body": "<p>On October 4 1944, less than six weeks after the liberation of Paris, Pablo Picasso, then 63, joined the French Communist party. To his surprise, the news covered more than half of the front page of the next day's L'Humanit\u00e9, the party's official newspaper, overshadowing reports of the war. The article celebrated the entry of \"the illustrious son of democratic Spain\" into \"la famille communiste\". </p> <p>Shortly after, in an interview for L'Humanit\u00e9, Picasso claimed that he had always fought, through the weapons of his art, like a true revolutionary. But he also said that the experience of the second world war had taught him that it was not sufficient to manifest political sympathies under the veil of mythologising artistic expression. \"I have become a communist because our party strives more than any other to know and to build the world, to make men clearer thinkers, more free and more happy. I have become a communist because the communists are the bravest in France, in the Soviet Union, as they are in my own country, Spain. While I wait for the time when Spain can take me back again, the French Communist party is a fatherland for me.</p> <p> In it I find again all my friends - the great scientists Paul Langevin and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie, the great writers Louis Aragon and Paul Eluard, and so many of the beautiful faces of the insurgents of Paris. I am again among brothers.\" Five days after joining the party Picasso appeared at a ceremony at the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery, organised as a joint memorial for those killed during the Commune of 1871 and in the Nazi occupation of Paris.</p> <p> Surrounded by party luminaries such as Aragon and Eluard, Aragon's novelist wife Elsa Triolet, the writer Eduard Pignon, philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and actor Jean-Louis Barrault, Picasso was prominent among what the newspaper Ce Soir estimated to be a crowd of 250,000. He also presided over the infamous gathering of the Comit\u00e9 Directeur du Front National des Arts, which drew up the list of artists to be purged for collaborationist activities during the occupation. In 1950 he was awarded the Stalin prize for his involvement in the Mouvement de la Paix, for which he had designed the emblem of a dove. The movement, ostensibly set up up by French and Polish intellectuals, was inaugurated in Wroclaw under the aegis of Andrey Zhdanov, secretary of the Soviet central committee and chief architect of Stalin's ideological campaign.</p> <p> Picasso's involvement also earned him an FBI file which was kept active until his death. Heavily edited, with large sections blacked out completely, the file was sent to me upon my request, under the US Freedom of Information Act. Third parties were to be investigated and their \"security status\" questioned, merely because they were acquainted with Picasso. Charlie Chaplin's friendship with Picasso - \"an admitted French CP member\" - further harmed his reputation in McCarthy's America, and led to calls for his extradition as a \"subversive alien\".</p> <p> One particularly damning entry, for June 16 1950, which is almost totally blacked out, accused him of spying for the Soviet Union. While Picasso was never an apparatchik, there was no doubt of his commitment to the party. He was never expected to attend the mandatory weekly cell meetings or go out to sell L'Humanit\u00e9 as other members were. But his propaganda value as a prestigious artist was incalculable, and he generously donated time and money to the FCP and associated organisations. He marched with the Front National des Intellectuels and the Front National Universitaire and accepted honorary positions on boards and in organisations. </p> <p> His contributions mostly took the form of paintings donated for sale. In November 1956 alone, the dealer Kahnweiler wrote that he gave on Picasso's behalf a cheque for FFr3m for Christmas gifts for Enfants des Fusill\u00e9s de la R\u00e9sistance, FFr500,000 for the Comit\u00e9 de la Paix, FFr300,000 for the Patriote de Toulouse, FFr750,000 more for the children of war victims and FFr3m (half a million more than the previous year) for a yearly Communist party event. (To give some perspective to these figures, Chrysler bought Picasso's Le Charnier in 1954 for FFr5m.) </p> <p>The political character of many of the charities Picasso sponsored can be surmised from the fact that a number of his contributions went through the hands of Georges Gosnat, member of the central committee and treasurer of the French Communist party. If it dawned only slowly on Picasso that the party would be unceasing in its demands on his time, money and political support - requests he fulfilled to an astonishing degree, if never to full party satisfaction - he had yet to feel pressure in matters of art itself. </p> <p>Although in the early years of his membership the party tolerated his chosen form of expression, which departed from the party style of socialist realism, by 1947 some critics had started to remonstrate that he was not putting his art more clearly at the service of his political beliefs. In 1953 the controversy over his \"privileged\" beyond-the-rules status erupted. Stalin died on March 5. Aragon and editor Pierre Daix were preparing an issue of the communist journal Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises when the news broke. Aragon immediately sent a telegram to Picasso, who was living with Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, requesting a drawing of Stalin. </p> <p>Daix and Gilot knew that Picasso, who until then had successfully foiled any hope that he would paint a portrait of Stalin, could not refuse this time. The artist's homage for Stalin's 70th birthday in 1949 had been nothing more than a drawing of a glass raised to the dictator's health, which had shocked the party faithful with its breezy caption, \"Staline \u00e0 ta sant\u00e9\". There is ample evidence that Picasso knew what Stalin looked like but Picasso claimed not to be able to summon Stalin's features. </p> <p>This time, he seems to have used old newspaper photographs as a reference. The portrait (see above) shows the young Stalin, face framed by thick, cropped hair, mouth partly hidden under a bushy moustache. The eyes under the strong eyebrows are those of a dreamer and offset by the prominent jawline. Picasso told Genevi\u00e8ve Laporte, with whom he was having an affair at the time, that he had wanted to show Stalin as a man of the people, without his uniform and decorations. But Daix has argued that the fact that Stalin's death followed shortly after the execution of victims of the Sl\u00e1nsky trial in Czechoslovakia should be taken into account. </p> <p> Daix maintained that the victims were people whom Picasso had known personally through their involvement in the Spanish civil war. One has to wonder, therefore, whether Picasso, in choosing to represent a young Stalin, perhaps still driven by an idealistic vision, perceived what most of the non-communist world already knew and what the communists only slowly came to accept: that in order to present an idealised image of the man, one had to go back into the early days of his life and of the revolution. Aragon and Daix were relieved to find the portrait to their liking. Daix opted for the neutral caption \"Staline par Pablo Picasso, March 8 1953\". </p> <p>Below it ran the names of Aragon, Nobel-prize winning scientist Joliot-Curie, and Picasso - \"les trois mousquetaires,\" as they were known - the most prestigious that the party intelligentsia could invoke. The adulatory tone of the accompanying articles, which celebrate \"the extraordinary man loved and revered as a master by every one of us,\" stands in sharp contrast to Picasso's drawing. Perhaps this is why his portrait was seen by many as an unforgivable act of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. </p> <p>For Aragon and Daix, the satisfaction with their commemorative issue was short-lived. The first negative reaction came from the employees of France Nouvelle and L'Humanit\u00e9, the two papers that shared the same building as Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises, who were appalled by what they considered an affront to Stalin. Daix suspected - correctly, as it turned out - that this was instigated by the party leaders, who saw publication of the portrait as an incursion against the personality cult, and by Auguste Lecur, hardline party secretary, who welcomed this opportunity to chastise Aragon and Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises for the relative independence they claimed.</p> <p> On seeing the journal, Elsa Triolet understood immediately that the simple fact that Picasso had dared to touch Stalin was going to infuriate the faithful, and she knew that disaster awaited them. She realised that the perceptual discrepancy between the young Georgian in the drawing and the usual representation of Stalin as \"the incarnation of wisdom, courage, of all that is human, of the one who had won the war, our saviour\" was too wide for believers. </p> <p>From the moment the paper appeared at kiosks on March 12, the editorial offices were flooded with outraged calls. On March 18 1953, a damaging communiqu\u00e9 appeared in L'Humanit\u00e9 from the secretariat of the French Communist party, \"categorically\" disapproving publication of the portrait \"by comrade Picasso\". It thanked and congratulated the numerous comrades who had immediately \"informed the central committee of their objections\" and demanded that comrade Aragon \"publish the essential passages of those letters, which will provide a contribution towards a positive criticism\". </p> <p> Aragon was obliged to publish the communiqu\u00e9 in the following issue of Les Lettres fran\u00e7aises, as well as a self-criticism in L'Humanit\u00e9. The major reproach in the letters was that the portrait neglected to reflect the emotions of the public - \"the love that the working class feel for the regretted comrade Stalin and for the Soviet Union\" - and that it did not do justice to the moral, spiritual, and intellectual personality of Stalin.</p> <p> \"No, this is not Stalin's face,\" wrote one correspondent, \"that face which was at once so kind and strong, so expressive, so inspiring of confidence in the honesty of our dear, great Stalin.\" \"Where is the radiance, the smile, the intelligence - in a word, the humanity - elsewhere always so visible in our dear Stalin's portraits?\" asked another. Picasso failed to capture the reassuring father figure, the man whose image \"had for years given a face to our hopes\". </p> <p>The most devastating letter came from the artist Andr\u00e9 Fougeron, the devoted exponent of the Zhdanov-approved style of socialist realism. As Daix wrote, it possessed the weight and character of a momentous political document, because it revealed for the first time the pressure put on communist artists to conform to the party line. Fougeron expressed \"the indignation and sadness of all the comrades\" that Aragon, with his choice of Picasso's portrait, gave his \"tacit encouragement to continue the sterile tricks of aesthetic formalism\". </p> <p>As organiser of the forthcoming Karl Marx exhibition, Fougeron declared furthermore that he absolutely refused to accept the \"so-called portrait\" as Picasso's contribution. Aragon was mortified, and threatened suicide. His wife, Elsa, pleaded in vain with Lecur to refrain from demanding Aragon's self-criticism. Picasso, besieged by journalists eager to have him admit that his portrait sought to mock Stalin, refuted any such suggestion. </p> <p>Nor did the attacks against him entice Picasso to disparage the party, as some had hoped. Despite various reports that quoted Picasso as saying that one did not criticise the flowers that were sent to the funeral or the tears that were shed, Gilot recalled a more detached attitude. According to her, Picasso replied that aesthetic matters were debatable, that therefore it was the party's right to criticise him and that he saw no need to politicise the issue. \"You've got the same situation in the party as in any big family,\" he said. \"There is always some damn fool to stir up trouble, but you have to put up with him.\" </p> <p> In conversation with Daix, who was sent by Aragon to appease him, Picasso speculated: \"Can you imagine if I had done the real Stalin, such as he has become, with his wrinkles, his pockets under the eyes, his warts.. A portrait in the style of Cranach! Can you hear them scream? 'He has disfigured Stalin! He has aged Stalin!'\" He continued: \"And then too, I said to myself, why not a Stalin in heroic nudity?... Yes, but, Stalin nude, and what about his virility?... If you take the pecker of the classical sculptor... So small... But, come on, Stalin, he was a true male, a bull. So then, if you give him the phallus of a bull, and you've got this little Stalin behind his big thing they'll cry: But you've made him into a sex maniac! A satyr! </p> <p>\"Then if you are a true realist you take your tape measure and you measure it all properly. That's worse, you made Stalin into an ordinary man. And then, as you are ready to sacrifice yourself, you make a plaster cast of your own thing. Well, it's even worse. What, you dare take yourself for Stalin! After all, Stalin, he must have had an erection all the time, just like the Greek statues... Tell me, you who knows, socialist realism, is that Stalin with an erection or without an erection?\" </p> <p>When in the summer of 1954 the communists began reluctantly to acknowledge Stalin's crimes (although little was conceded publicly), Picasso, thinking aloud, asked Daix: \"Don't you think that soon they will find that my portrait is too nice?\" On another occasion, he reflected: \"Fortunately I drew the young Stalin. The old one never existed. Only for the official painters.\" </p> <p>Picasso later called the year 1953 his \"saison en enfer\" - his season in hell. He admitted to some friends how shaken he had been by the accusations and humiliations of the scandal. The year is widely believed to signal the end of Picasso's political commitment. Yet while his cooperation with the party was never again as close as it had been in the years 1944-53, his commitment did not stop. He continued to produce drawings for the press and for poster designs, made supportive appearances at party events, and readily signed petitions and protest declarations initiated by the party. </p> <p>He also never discontinued his financial support. While many left because of the party's attitude during the Hungarian uprising in 1956, Picasso reaffirmed his loyalty. In an interview with the art critic Carlton Lake in July 1957, he once again confirmed his belief in communism and his intention never to leave the party. In 1962 he was awarded the Lenin prize. In August 1968, speaking with friends, he deplored the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, but failed to do so publicly. At the end of that year, he refused once again to speak out against his long-held political beliefs. </p> <p>Picasso had entered the party with enthusiasm and some idealism. It is difficult to know when the awareness of the gap between its claims and the realities set in. After Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" at the 20th congress of the Soviet Union's Communist party, in February 1956, in which he reported on the crimes of Stalin's tyranny, it became impossible for anybody to claim ignorance. Picasso apparently was appalled: \"While they asked you to do ever more for the happiness of men... they hung this one and tortured that one. And those were innocents. Will this change?\" </p> <p>Even as the evidence of the harsh realities of the communist world mounted, even as it dawned that \"they were as wrong in politics as in the arts\" - a possibility he had once expressed with foreboding - he continued to refuse anyone the right to question his political engagement. </p> <p>Daix later maintained that although \"Picasso could be unjust, capricious, even sadistic in private_ in a quarter of a century, I always found him ready to assume his share of the misfortunes of whatever community he had chosen. Not only the communists, but all of his own: the Spaniards, the painters, the poets, his near relations. Ready, that is, able to give his time, his work as a painter. If this side of him remains so misunderstood, it is because the party was part of his family, and family matters were taken care of in private.\" </p> <p>Picasso's response to detrimental news from the Soviet Union was: \"And the workers, are they still masters of their factories, and the peasants, the owners of their land?

      "bodyText": "On October 4 1944, less than six weeks after the liberation of Paris, Pablo Picasso, then 63, joined the French Communist party. To his surprise, the news covered more than half of the front page of the next day's L'Humanit\u00e9, the party's official newspaper, overshadowing reports of the war. The article celebrated the entry of \"the illustrious son of democratic Spain\" into \"la famille communiste\". Shortly after, in an interview for L'Humanit\u00e9, Picasso claimed that he had always fought, through the weapons of his art, like a true revolutionary. But he also said that the experience of the second world war had taught him that it was not sufficient to manifest political sympathies under the veil of mythologising artistic expression. \"I have become a communist because our party strives more than any other to know and to build the world, to make men clearer thinkers, more free and more happy. I have become a communist because the communists are the bravest in France, in the Soviet Union, as they are in my own country, Spain. While I wait for the time when Spain can take me back again, the French Communist party is a fatherland for me. In it I find again all my friends - the great scientists Paul Langevin and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie, the great writers Louis Aragon and Paul Eluard, and so many of the beautiful faces of the insurgents of Paris. I am again among brothers.\" Five days after joining the party Picasso appeared at a ceremony at the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery, organised as a joint memorial for those killed during the Commune of 1871 and in the Nazi occupation of Paris. Surrounded by party luminaries such as Aragon and Eluard, Aragon's novelist wife Elsa Triolet, the writer Eduard Pignon, philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and actor Jean-Louis Barrault, Picasso was prominent among what the newspaper Ce Soir estimated to be a crowd of 250,000. He also presided over the infamous gathering of the Comit\u00e9 Directeur du Front National des Arts, which drew up the list of artists to be purged for collaborationist activities during the occupation. In 1950 he was awarded the Stalin prize for his involvement in the Mouvement de la Paix, for which he had designed the emblem of a dove. The movement, ostensibly set up up by French and Polish intellectuals, was inaugurated in Wroclaw under the aegis of Andrey Zhdanov, secretary of the Soviet central committee and chief architect of Stalin's ideological campaign. Picasso's involvement also earned him an FBI file which was kept active until his death. Heavily edited, with large sections blacked out completely, the file was sent to me upon my request, under the US Freedom of Information Act. Third parties were to be investigated and their \"security status\" questioned, merely because they were acquainted with Picasso. Charlie Chaplin's friendship with Picasso - \"an admitted French CP member\" - further harmed his reputation in McCarthy's America, and led to calls for his extradition as a \"subversive alien\". One particularly damning entry, for June 16 1950, which is almost totally blacked out, accused him of spying for the Soviet Union. While Picasso was never an apparatchik, there was no doubt of his commitment to the party. He was never expected to attend the mandatory weekly cell meetings or go out to sell L'Humanit\u00e9 as other members were. But his propaganda value as a prestigious artist was incalculable, and he generously donated time and money to the FCP and associated organisations. He marched with the Front National des Intellectuels and the Front National Universitaire and accepted honorary positions on boards and in organisations. His contributions mostly took the form of paintings donated for sale. In November 1956 alone, the dealer Kahnweiler wrote that he gave on Picasso's behalf a cheque for FFr3m for Christmas gifts for Enfants des Fusill\u00e9s de la R\u00e9sistance, FFr500,000 for the Comit\u00e9 de la Paix, FFr300,000 for the Patriote de Toulouse, FFr750,000 more for the children of war victims and FFr3m (half a million more than the previous year) for a yearly Communist party event.

Its sensitive perceptions are clouded by its fondness for what has gone before. It resurrects old formulae where it should be inspired by a vision for the future. </p> <p>Billington gives the National a threefold mission, \"to reclaim the best of world drama, to retrieve neglected British classics and to explore the tensions and dilemmas within our own society\". His first two aims - to reclaim and to retrieve - are entirely retrospective, more suited to a museum than a theatre. His third contains a germ that might just be theatre's salvation. </p> <p>If theatre is to have any value at all, it must be about the present. Unlike TV and film - where powerful contemporary stories are told by artists who used to make theatre - a play is live. Theatrical performance is sexy because it involves an instantaneous meeting of minds. It is a collision between artists and the public. In the switchback play between the stage and auditorium, theatre brings discovery, enlightenment, fury, ecstasy and revolution. But before it can do any of these things, it must engage with its public. Theatre will only recover the vigour it has lost if audiences who are currently alienated by it can feel its relevance to their lives and claim it as their own. </p> <p>In order to establish the right mission for a national theatre, we need to strip the idea of theatre back to the bone. There is no place for retrospective seasons based on the architecture of the building, no room for knee-jerk reliance on the classics. If, as Billington suggests, the shape of the Lyttleton theatre is only suited to 20th-century classics, then the shape of the Lyttleton theatre must be changed. How far in front of a horse can the cart get? We must acknowledge that theatre has lost ground to dance, TV, film, and stand-up comedy by being hidebound in its traditions. The heritage approach to theatre, so understandable after the second world war, so durable under the assault of the angry young men in the 50s and so fossilised by the funding system ever since, is finally reaching its sell-by date. John Freeman, writing in this newspaper a fortnight ago, was not so wide of the mark. If theatre fails to evolve it will die. </p> <p>For some, of course, the process of reinvention has already begun. Inspired by the work of the Polish visionary Tadeusz Kantor, Theatre de Complicite has created a new form of theatre, which tours to packed houses all over the country. Mnemonic was applauded by many as the best production of last year and it finally arrives at the National Theatre in January. </p> <p>In pockets of inspiration across the country, theatre-makers have returned to the essence of live performance and - where subsidy allows - high quality, accessible popular work has flourished. Knee-High Theatre, well supported in their native Cornwall, make work that seems to sidestep all of the pitfalls of convention; the spellbinding Red Shoes is the latest of many examples. Further towards the fringe, quirky eccentrics such as Ken Campbell rise through the theatrical soup like bolts of electricity and startle audiences with the immediacy of their work. </p> <p>But the enduring taste of our big theatres is musty and obscure. If in doubt, turn to the classics, is the daily lesson, or dig out an obscure revival with a film star on the poster. The West End's current star fetish is like a ravenous bulldog feasting on the entrails of tired theatrical form. We would do well to remember that while Shakespeare was reinventing theatre for the audiences of Elizabethan London, it was forgotten poets such as Samuel Daniel who harked back to the inherited formulae of \"the classics\". </p> <p>The mission of the National Theatre must be to re-establish theatre as a vital cauldron in which contemporary stories and issues are shared between live artists and live audiences. The way to achieve this is to scour the country for the artists who are already reworking theatrical form to tell their own stories, and support, nurture and promote their work. </p> <p>But as the funding for theatre has collapsed, there are fewer producers to support these artists, fewer theatres to offer them guidance and fewer stages for them to perform on. Dancer, story-teller and poet Benji Reid in Manchester is bewildered at how to develop his extraordinary talent. The puppeteers Faulty Optic have won awards all over Europe but their miniature work is almost unheard of in England. Kazuko Hohki is winning hearts in tiny studio theatres in London. She, like the others, may very well want to end up in the National Theatre - and God knows she would be good for it - but its vast stages are a world away from their expertise and experience. </p> <p>The National must be actively involved in the development of these theatre-makers. Some, such as the enchanting storyteller Toby Jones, already enjoy the patronage of its Studio. But this support needs to be extended to carry the revolutionary small-scale into middle-scale venues where the skills of the artists can reach larger audiences. The regional theatres have a vital part to play here, as Ruth McKenzie's Nottingham Playhouse did in the 1980s and Alan Lyddyard's Northern Stage and Jude Kelly's West Yorkshire Playhouse set out to do today. Even as you read, the Arts Council is pondering how to spend a new windfall of public funding for theatre, which comes on stream in April 2003. If the National is to achieve its mission, it must be brokering relationships and be in the vanguard of the whole funding reform. </p> <p>I propose a radical change of agenda by which the project of the National Theatre is to pioneer the theatre of the coming century. Everything the National does must contribute to the inspiration of the next generation of artists. </p> <p>It would be ludicrous to ban classics or musicals, but the National's programmers should ransack the work of visionary British theatre-makers to stage them. If theatre across the country were already vibrant, accessible and relevant, it would be fine for the National to sit back and cherry pick the most refined and treasurable work from the national crop. This, however, is not the case. The best theatre across the country is struggling to reinvent itself for the young artists and young audiences on which its future depends.

As the exhibition's subtitle - The Art and Science of the Human Body from Leonardo to Now - suggests, this is a vast collection of objects, paintings, drawings and engravings, of medical models, skeletons in cupboards, pickled foetuses, life and death masks, flayed figures, surgical tools and (inevitably) modern art. The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Jan Deijman, Rembrandt's ruin of a painting, depicting a cadaver with a peeled scalp, open skull and gelatinous mass of brain, is but one of the rarely seen marvels and curiosities that make this such a compelling and unmissable show. But we have been here before, even down to the reworkings of Charcot's dubious demonstrations of female hysteria in Paris at the end of the 19th century by a modern artist, and the display of Alphonse Bertillon's photographs of criminal types for the Paris police. This exhibition is but another reworking of the subject, done on a grand scale. Only the examples and alignments have changed.

      "body": "<p>I owe a serious apology to Professor the Lord Laird, who I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. His card describes him as \"Heid-Yin o tha boord o Ulster Scotch\" which I mistakenly thought was gibberish, but is in fact Ulster-Scots for \"head of the Ulster-Scots agency\". To show there were no - or at least few - hard feelings, he took me for lunch in the House of Lords, where I had hoped to have nursery food, steak and kidney pudding followed by spotted dick, but which has modernised itself, and now serves rather good trendy dishes. </p> <p>It turns out that Ulster-Scots (sometimes called Ullans) is now the fastest growing minority language and culture in Europe. Around 150,000 people throughout the original nine counties of Ulster speak it, and under the \"parity of esteem\" provisions of the Belfast agreement, it is supposed to have equal standing with English and Irish. It's actually very close to the Scots dialect in which Burns wrote, and is full of vigorous phrases such as \"a gleed o wut\" (a spark of intelligence) or \"tha mair its aa yin noo\" which means \"it doesn't matter any more\". \"Alas\" is translated as \"waesucks!\" </p> <p>Professor Laird told me that his agency is now in constant touch with Dublin to make sure that Ulster-Scots is given, as the agreement demands, the same place and prestige throughout the island as Irish has now. \"I am,\" he said gravely, \"enormously grateful for the billions of pounds the Irish taxpayer is about to spend on this exercise.\" I said I was doubtful that they would. For example, he says, the Irish police will have to be renamed the \"Garda Siochana Hanin Polis\", the last two words being Ullans for \"local police\". </p> <p>\"I cannot believe that the sovereign government of Ireland will not be aware of the details of the agreement its ministers signed, or would dream of reneging on them,\" he told me. But perhaps there was a twinkle in his eye when he said it. </p> <p>\u0095 Like many successful businessmen who go into politics, Geoffrey Robinson brings with him a strangely naive and detached air. It's as if, however rapacious the world of high finance might be, it is still more kindly, decorous and honest than Westminster. About a zillion years ago, I used to help the Labour party by helping conduct mock press conferences with by-election candidates. We would subject them to the most hostile questioning they might conceivably face during the real campaign. </p> <p>One of our clients was Robinson. He came into the office and we immediately demanded to know what a socalist was doing earning a fortune as chairman of Jaguar, and while we were at it, intimate details of his love life. After 10 minutes, he got up, shouted \"I don't have to put up with this!\" and stormed out of the room, only to be gently told by the party staff that it was a cod interview, a fact he had somehow failed to take on board. Bless, as we say these days. </p> <p>\u0095 Sorry to bore on about mobile phones - yes, I do have one, but I don't yell into it for half an hour at a time when other people on the train are trying to read the paper - but they created a lovely occasion this week. It was the concert given by the younger boys in my son's school. The penultimate item was the \"world premiere\" of a work by the extremely jolly and very enthusiastic head of music, David Nield, entitled La Phona Mobile. He introduced it by saying he hoped to become as rich as John Cage by writing music consisting largely of random sounds, then turned dramatically to the massed boys of the choir. Each had borrowed a mobile phone. Some of these had been selected because the ringing tone was a particular piece of music. Others had the job of keying in those numbers. Then, at an over-the-top signal from Mr Nield, each boy had to hit the \"call\" button on his mobe, so causing another phone to ring. </p> <p>A few moments later, the hall was filled with strange discordant noises as The Ride Of The Valkyries blended with the Post Horn Gallop and the William Tell Overture, all overlaid with Beethoven's Ninth. The sound took on a sort of strange, unexpected eldritch beauty, ending with a teacher firing a starter's pistol, and huge applause from the audience. </p> <p>\u0095 The most astonishing posters from the world's greatest advertising industry have started to appear. They advertise Gossard women's underwear. One shows the top half of a naked woman, breast exposed, lying on a bed with her right arm flung back in apparent ecstacy. On the floor are her bra and panties and, to make certain we know she's not alone, a man's shoe is also there, clearly thrown on the carpet in some haste. The caption reads: \"Bring him to his knees. Find your G-spot\", the \"G\" in question being the firm's logo. </p> <p>Then yesterday, they put up one two streets away from us. It shows the same naked woman, one arm similarly flung back, the other invisible. The caption reads: \"if he's late, you can always start without him. Find your G-spot.\" </p> <p>This is, I suspect, the first mass-market hoarding in Britain to openly advertise masturbation. I don't mind a spot of filth myself, though I suspect a few parents will be troubled by the question, \"what does that mean, mummy?\" I suppose the most depressing thing is that the great minds who came up with the campaign probably think it's fantastically subtle and allusive. </p> <p>\u0095 I'm researching a programme on The Archers for The Archive Hour on Radio 4, and I was fascinated to discover that the bucolic soap - 50 years old this year - began for the excellent reason that, then as now, farmers had lost all faith in the ministry of agriculture. The show started in the midlands, where BBC producers were desperate to find a way of giving farmers advice without using the discredited imprimatur of the ministry. Its officials had, during the war, persuaded the farmers of Evesham to tear up their asparagus beds, many of which were decades old, and replace them with potatoes.

      "body": "<p> In taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy; but in passing it over, he is superior. - Francis Bacon </p> <p>A common thread this week in the Middle East crisis, the threat of retaliation by the \"Real IRA\" for the killing of one of its members, and the publication of Geoffrey Robinson's memoirs, is revenge. There is nothing so urgent as the desire for revenge, when real or perceived injury has been done to oneself or one's community, and there is nothing so sweet as the angry pleasure it gives once enacted. </p> <p>Connoisseurs of revenge might applaud Emile Gaboriau's remark that \"revenge is a luscious fruit which you must leave to ripen,\" but it is rare for revenge to be patient. We hurry to avenge whereas we dawdle to pay other kinds of debts - most notably those of gratitude - and failure to achieve revenge is painful and mortifying in ways that not discharging other debts rarely is. </p> <p>The impulse to revenge is an impulse to justice, but it is a primitive one, and although its intention is to restore a balance, its personal and emotional basis always threatens to make it too harsh and punitive, therefore inviting further revenge. Between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, the Montagues and the Capulets, vengeance bred vengeance; that is the nature of feuds, which quickly escalate and consume the parties to them in a spiral of hatred and violence. </p> <p>\"It is sweet,\" said Euripides, \"to see your foe perish, and pay to justice everything he owes,\" but, alas, matters almost never stop there. And that is the crucial problem: for society cannot function if individuals are left to seek redress on their own; justice cannot be a matter of private enterprise. Recognition of this fact from the earliest times led to the building of institutions of justice, culminating - in mature societies - in laws, with officers to oversee their proper application, and with due form and process as a protection against whatever forces might pervert their functioning. </p> <p>A system of justice can be seen as a human best endeavour (describing it as such acknowledges the imperfection of all human creations) to provide an objective and impartial means of redressing wrong, whether against individuals or the collective. Because the justice system is constituted by the collective, and from it gets its remit and authority, it acts as the collective's agent, and carries out its desire for justice wherever required and possible. </p> <p>Revenge is only one part of the aim - although some think the aim should be rehabilitation exclusively, never retribution - and this downgrading of revenge is appropriate in a mature state of society, where the fundamental idea of the implicit contract between its members, and between each of them and all the others, is to live by the rules for the sake of all-round mutual benefit. When members of society flout the rules, they accept the agreed sanctions for doing so; but that is not a case of society taking revenge, properly speaking, so much as redressing the balance of relationships and repairing the wrong done to them. </p> <p>Desire for revenge is most dangerous when felt by individuals additionally oppressed by fear, anger, and a sense of impotence in the face of perceived injustice. Most of the world's flashpoints are thickly wreathed in such combustible vapours. When someone who seems to have every reason in the world to seek revenge - Nelson Mandela, say - does not do so, the example set is extraordinary and impressive. \"No revenge is more honourable than the one not taken,\" says the Spanish proverb. </p> <p>There is nobility in forbearance, and it expresses a desire for something far greater and grander than revenge, namely peace, a future, and an end to the festering hatreds and hurts which poison life. It takes magnanimity - a word anglicised from \"magna anima\" which means \"great soul\" - to rise above revenge. Magnanimity is always in short supply, but it is the main ingredient in everything that makes the world a better place, and the only antidote to the rage for revenge which always makes bad things worse. </p>",

There is nothing so urgent as the desire for revenge, when real or perceived injury has been done to oneself or one's community, and there is nothing so sweet as the angry pleasure it gives once enacted. Connoisseurs of revenge might applaud Emile Gaboriau's remark that \"revenge is a luscious fruit which you must leave to ripen,\" but it is rare for revenge to be patient. We hurry to avenge whereas we dawdle to pay other kinds of debts - most notably those of gratitude - and failure to achieve revenge is painful and mortifying in ways that not discharging other debts rarely is. The impulse to revenge is an impulse to justice, but it is a primitive one, and although its intention is to restore a balance, its personal and emotional basis always threatens to make it too harsh and punitive, therefore inviting further revenge. Between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, the Montagues and the Capulets, vengeance bred vengeance; that is the nature of feuds, which quickly escalate and consume the parties to them in a spiral of hatred and violence. \"It is sweet,\" said Euripides, \"to see your foe perish, and pay to justice everything he owes,\" but, alas, matters almost never stop there. And that is the crucial problem: for society cannot function if individuals are left to seek redress on their own; justice cannot be a matter of private enterprise. Recognition of this fact from the earliest times led to the building of institutions of justice, culminating - in mature societies - in laws, with officers to oversee their proper application, and with due form and process as a protection against whatever forces might pervert their functioning. A system of justice can be seen as a human best endeavour (describing it as such acknowledges the imperfection of all human creations) to provide an objective and impartial means of redressing wrong, whether against individuals or the collective. Because the justice system is constituted by the collective, and from it gets its remit and authority, it acts as the collective's agent, and carries out its desire for justice wherever required and possible. Revenge is only one part of the aim - although some think the aim should be rehabilitation exclusively, never retribution - and this downgrading of revenge is appropriate in a mature state of society, where the fundamental idea of the implicit contract between its members, and between each of them and all the others, is to live by the rules for the sake of all-round mutual benefit. When members of society flout the rules, they accept the agreed sanctions for doing so; but that is not a case of society taking revenge, properly speaking, so much as redressing the balance of relationships and repairing the wrong done to them. Desire for revenge is most dangerous when felt by individuals additionally oppressed by fear, anger, and a sense of impotence in the face of perceived injustice. Most of the world's flashpoints are thickly wreathed in such combustible vapours. When someone who seems to have every reason in the world to seek revenge - Nelson Mandela, say - does not do so, the example set is extraordinary and impressive. \"No revenge is more honourable than the one not taken,\" says the Spanish proverb. There is nobility in forbearance, and it expresses a desire for something far greater and grander than revenge, namely peace, a future, and an end to the festering hatreds and hurts which poison life. It takes magnanimity - a word anglicised from \"magna anima\" which means \"great soul\" - to rise above revenge. Magnanimity is always in short supply, but it is the main ingredient in everything that makes the world a better place, and the only antidote to the rage for revenge which always makes bad things worse.",

      "body": "<p>By an odd twist of fate, my wife Anne and I were on our first visit to Greece when we received the sad news of the death of our friend, Pat Pottle (Obituary, October 3).</p> <p>Pat's own links with Greece went back nearly 40 years to April 1963, when he attended the historic Marathon-to-Athens peace march which contributed so importantly to the unfreezing of political life in Greece. The march was organised by the Bertrand Russell Youth Committee for Nuclear Disarmament, which drew its inspiration from the Committee of 100, and was formed in 1962 after the Cuban missile crisis.</p> <p>Pat and all but one of the marchers - the MP, Grigoris Lambrakis, who had parliamentary immunity - were arrested. Many, including Pat, being attacked and beaten by the police. Pat responded by sitting down in the road, a tactic which Greek friends on the march told me they found novel and inspirational.</p> <p>A month later, Lambrakis was struck down by a blow to the head from an assassin on a motor tricycle, acting, it seems, on instructions from the leaders of the Greek armed forces (the events are depicted in Costa-Gavras's 1969 film film, Z). While Lambrakis's life hung in the balance, his friends phoned Russell, and Pat and his colleagues arranged for a British specialist to fly out to Greece. Unfortunately, before he could do so, Lambrakis was dead.</p> <p>But his funeral turned into the largest political demonstration in postwar Greece; Athens came to a standstill with a close to one-day general strike, and 500,000 people taking to the streets to follow the funeral cortege.</p> <p>The following month, when King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a state visit to Britain, it was disrupted by demonstrations organised by the Committee of 100 and the ad hoc Save Greece Now Committee.</p> <p>In the subsequent Greek elections, the Centre Union Party emerged victorious, and introduced a period of political reform, only terminated by the 1967 colonels' coup.</p> <p>This was the background to the occupation of the Greek embassy in London, organised by Committee of 100 supporters. Pat was among those arrested, but he kicked open the police van at a set of traffic lights and shouted, \"Everybody out.\" Next day, he appeared in court, wearing, for once, a collar and tie, and stood bail for those of us who had not been so fortunate.</p> <p>Pat was a marvellous raconteur with a hilarious and ribald sense of humour. He could make a joke even out of his own painful experiences - as when he described, in The Blake Escape (1989), the medical examination at reception in Wormwood Scrubs. \"In full view of other prisoners, you bent over and spread your cheeks while the doctor looked up your bum. To this day, I can't imagine what he was looking for - but, whatever it was, he didn't find it on me.\"</p> <p>During our Old Bailey trial in 1991, the prosecution argued that the videotape we had made in Moscow, in which Blake confirmed our role in his escape - without the knowledge of the KGB, was irrelevant and should not be shown to the jury. Pat interrupted thus: \"It may not go towards our innocence, m' lud, but it clearly does go towards our guilt.\" The judge allowed the tape to be shown, and one of the highlights of the case was the screen appearance of Blake in the very court which had sentenced him to 42 years almost 30 years earlier.</p> <p>Pat's closing address was a direct appeal to the conscience of the jury members. They can hardly fail to have been moved by it, and I have no doubt that it was one of the factors which led to their decision to acquit us.</p> <p><b>Michael Randle</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "By an odd twist of fate, my wife Anne and I were on our first visit to Greece when we received the sad news of the death of our friend, Pat Pottle (Obituary, October 3). Pat's own links with Greece went back nearly 40 years to April 1963, when he attended the historic Marathon-to-Athens peace march which contributed so importantly to the unfreezing of political life in Greece. The march was organised by the Bertrand Russell Youth Committee for Nuclear Disarmament, which drew its inspiration from the Committee of 100, and was formed in 1962 after the Cuban missile crisis. Pat and all but one of the marchers - the MP, Grigoris Lambrakis, who had parliamentary immunity - were arrested. Many, including Pat, being attacked and beaten by the police. Pat responded by sitting down in the road, a tactic which Greek friends on the march told me they found novel and inspirational. A month later, Lambrakis was struck down by a blow to the head from an assassin on a motor tricycle, acting, it seems, on instructions from the leaders of the Greek armed forces (the events are depicted in Costa-Gavras's 1969 film film, Z). While Lambrakis's life hung in the balance, his friends phoned Russell, and Pat and his colleagues arranged for a British specialist to fly out to Greece. Unfortunately, before he could do so, Lambrakis was dead. But his funeral turned into the largest political demonstration in postwar Greece; Athens came to a standstill with a close to one-day general strike, and 500,000 people taking to the streets to follow the funeral cortege. The following month, when King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a state visit to Britain, it was disrupted by demonstrations organised by the Committee of 100 and the ad hoc Save Greece Now Committee. In the subsequent Greek elections, the Centre Union Party emerged victorious, and introduced a period of political reform, only terminated by the 1967 colonels' coup. This was the background to the occupation of the Greek embassy in London, organised by Committee of 100 supporters. Pat was among those arrested, but he kicked open the police van at a set of traffic lights and shouted, \"Everybody out.\" Next day, he appeared in court, wearing, for once, a collar and tie, and stood bail for those of us who had not been so fortunate. Pat was a marvellous raconteur with a hilarious and ribald sense of humour. He could make a joke even out of his own painful experiences - as when he described, in The Blake Escape (1989), the medical examination at reception in Wormwood Scrubs. \"In full view of other prisoners, you bent over and spread your cheeks while the doctor looked up your bum. To this day, I can't imagine what he was looking for - but, whatever it was, he didn't find it on me.\" During our Old Bailey trial in 1991, the prosecution argued that the videotape we had made in Moscow, in which Blake confirmed our role in his escape - without the knowledge of the KGB, was irrelevant and should not be shown to the jury. Pat interrupted thus: \"It may not go towards our innocence, m' lud, but it clearly does go towards our guilt.\" The judge allowed the tape to be shown, and one of the highlights of the case was the screen appearance of Blake in the very court which had sentenced him to 42 years almost 30 years earlier. Pat's closing address was a direct appeal to the conscience of the jury members. They can hardly fail to have been moved by it, and I have no doubt that it was one of the factors which led to their decision to acquit us. Michael Randle",

      "body": "<p>As I write, early in the month, it seems to me that autumn colour is developing late this year. With our own natives, most of which colour quite modestly, I usually reckon the last week of October and first week of November to see the peak, but many of our most glamorous introductions from Japan and North America do it a good deal earlier. The single pink ornamental cherry Prunus sargentii, for instance, often peaks in September.</p> <p>Exciting though autumn conflagrations are, a few points are worth bearing in mind before making choices for one's own garden. One is that the amount of colour produced may vary a lot from year to year. Climatic factors affect this situation and there's nothing we can do to alter them. Combine this with the fact that the colour, if it does materialise, may last for the inside of two weeks and it becomes obvious that a plant - particularly a bulky one, or even a tree - is not worth choosing for autumn colour alone. It needs to give us pleasure in other ways at other seasons.</p> <p>Viburnum lantanoides (syn. V. alnifolium), for instance, a large, shapeless shrub and singularly boring for most of the year, can hardly deserve inclusion except in the largest of settings, just for its brief autumn brilliance. I also have my doubts about the genus Fothergilla, although many a gardener has got carried away by its display when visiting one of the large gardens noted for their spectacular fall colour. Admittedly it carries poufs of pale, yellowish, scented (but not outstandingly scented) flowers in spring, but that doesn't amount to much, and the leaf shape simply is not trying.</p> <p>By contrast, most maples (acer), with their palmate, sharply-pointed leaf structure, revel in this excellent feature throughout the summer, although one might be forgiven for omitting the sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus. Some of the Japanese maples, named cultivars of A. palmatum and A. japonicum (among others), make delightful small specimen trees, if your conditions suit them - acid soil and reasonable protection from wind. When they colour in autumn, I always feel that the best moment is reached before the entire leaf is red (or yellow) but while the veins are still green. The effect is more interesting for being less homogeneous than when the entire leaf and all the leaves are a solid block of one colour.</p> <p>The botanists have been making hay with name changes in these Japanese maples but one of the best, in my opinion, is widely known as A. palmatum 'Senkaki' (now 'Sango-kaku'). Besides making a pretty little tree with neat foliage, it turns to clear yellow in fall and then, in winter, reveals its bright pink young stems. Where space is limited, I would (if you don't mind a somewhat chunky, fastigiate habit) recommend A. palmatum 'Shishigashira', with crimped, almost parsley-like dark green foliage changing in November to rich shades of burnt orange. This is good where space is limited.</p> <p>When a tree or shrub is bought with a clonal name, you should be safe with regard to its colour potential in areas where that is well known to be a primary consideration. Thus, with Liquidambar styraciflua - a tall tree with maple-like leaves - the cultivars 'Lane Roberts' and 'Worplesdon', both holders of the RHS Award of Garden Merit, will not let you down as autumn colourers. However, seedlings, which are easily raised, often fail to colour at all throughout their long lives. It often pays to buy your plant \"on the hoof\" and at the season, just before leaf fall, when high colour is to be expected. Admittedly, if pot-grown and pot-bound, that is to say rather starved, it may colour more highly than would be normal given a free root run, but at least you will know that the plant is capable of colouring well, whereas others may never be.</p> <p>That is the way I should choose a Virginia creeper. Avoiding the magenta-colouring, glossy-leaved Parthenocissus tricuspidata , which is the most widely planted species but a coarse thing, I would go for P. quinquefolia (in which each leaf has five separate fingers), or the smaller P. henryana.</p> <p>It is the same with that handsome, giant vine, Vitis coignetiae. Buy a plant that you can see is able to develop the desired rose-red colouring. A great advantage in this vine is that it starts colouring early and then continues for many weeks before finally shedding its foliage. It has great vigour if well fed and watered at the root and never looks better than growing over the dark, rich green of a common ivy - say up an old ash tree. But if given dry, dusty conditions full of competing roots, it can never make a go of it.</p> <p>One of the most popular hawthorns for its clusters of dark red berries as well as for its fall leaf colour is the American Crataegus persimilis 'Prunifolia', but there are sometimes complaints that its leaves fail to colour. In my experience this happens when its crop of haws is exceptionally heavy. The tree is exhausted and its leaves, considerably reduced in size and numbers, just drop off without any attempt at colour. However, when the fruit crop is light or moderate, a fine foliar display with yellows, orange and reds, can be expected. We mustn't be greedy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As I write, early in the month, it seems to me that autumn colour is developing late this year. With our own natives, most of which colour quite modestly, I usually reckon the last week of October and first week of November to see the peak, but many of our most glamorous introductions from Japan and North America do it a good deal earlier. The single pink ornamental cherry Prunus sargentii, for instance, often peaks in September. Exciting though autumn conflagrations are, a few points are worth bearing in mind before making choices for one's own garden. One is that the amount of colour produced may vary a lot from year to year. Climatic factors affect this situation and there's nothing we can do to alter them. Combine this with the fact that the colour, if it does materialise, may last for the inside of two weeks and it becomes obvious that a plant - particularly a bulky one, or even a tree - is not worth choosing for autumn colour alone. It needs to give us pleasure in other ways at other seasons. Viburnum lantanoides (syn. V. alnifolium), for instance, a large, shapeless shrub and singularly boring for most of the year, can hardly deserve inclusion except in the largest of settings, just for its brief autumn brilliance. I also have my doubts about the genus Fothergilla, although many a gardener has got carried away by its display when visiting one of the large gardens noted for their spectacular fall colour. Admittedly it carries poufs of pale, yellowish, scented (but not outstandingly scented) flowers in spring, but that doesn't amount to much, and the leaf shape simply is not trying. By contrast, most maples (acer), with their palmate, sharply-pointed leaf structure, revel in this excellent feature throughout the summer, although one might be forgiven for omitting the sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus. Some of the Japanese maples, named cultivars of A. palmatum and A. japonicum (among others), make delightful small specimen trees, if your conditions suit them - acid soil and reasonable protection from wind. When they colour in autumn, I always feel that the best moment is reached before the entire leaf is red (or yellow) but while the veins are still green. The effect is more interesting for being less homogeneous than when the entire leaf and all the leaves are a solid block of one colour. The botanists have been making hay with name changes in these Japanese maples but one of the best, in my opinion, is widely known as A. palmatum 'Senkaki' (now 'Sango-kaku'). Besides making a pretty little tree with neat foliage, it turns to clear yellow in fall and then, in winter, reveals its bright pink young stems. Where space is limited, I would (if you don't mind a somewhat chunky, fastigiate habit) recommend A. palmatum 'Shishigashira', with crimped, almost parsley-like dark green foliage changing in November to rich shades of burnt orange. This is good where space is limited. When a tree or shrub is bought with a clonal name, you should be safe with regard to its colour potential in areas where that is well known to be a primary consideration. Thus, with Liquidambar styraciflua - a tall tree with maple-like leaves - the cultivars 'Lane Roberts' and 'Worplesdon', both holders of the RHS Award of Garden Merit, will not let you down as autumn colourers. However, seedlings, which are easily raised, often fail to colour at all throughout their long lives. It often pays to buy your plant \"on the hoof\" and at the season, just before leaf fall, when high colour is to be expected. Admittedly, if pot-grown and pot-bound, that is to say rather starved, it may colour more highly than would be normal given a free root run, but at least you will know that the plant is capable of colouring well, whereas others may never be. That is the way I should choose a Virginia creeper. Avoiding the magenta-colouring, glossy-leaved Parthenocissus tricuspidata , which is the most widely planted species but a coarse thing, I would go for P. quinquefolia (in which each leaf has five separate fingers), or the smaller P. henryana. It is the same with that handsome, giant vine, Vitis coignetiae. Buy a plant that you can see is able to develop the desired rose-red colouring. A great advantage in this vine is that it starts colouring early and then continues for many weeks before finally shedding its foliage. It has great vigour if well fed and watered at the root and never looks better than growing over the dark, rich green of a common ivy - say up an old ash tree. But if given dry, dusty conditions full of competing roots, it can never make a go of it. One of the most popular hawthorns for its clusters of dark red berries as well as for its fall leaf colour is the American Crataegus persimilis 'Prunifolia', but there are sometimes complaints that its leaves fail to colour. In my experience this happens when its crop of haws is exceptionally heavy. The tree is exhausted and its leaves, considerably reduced in size and numbers, just drop off without any attempt at colour. However, when the fruit crop is light or moderate, a fine foliar display with yellows, orange and reds, can be expected. We mustn't be greedy.",

You can't go anywhere without hearing Eminem's queeny, hissy-fit whine - for a man who hates fags, he does a lovely job of sounding like a sitcom parody of one. As I think I've said before (this is a special service for my trainspotting readers who like to keep tabs on the number of times I use a particular line), when I hear Marshall Mathers III (in Eminem's real name, we get a delicious insight into what a nerd he really is) going on about Christina Aguilera and what a 'little bitch' she is, I am reminded of nothing so much as a silicone-breasted drag queen jealous of a real woman's breasts. </p> <p>Aguilera claims that she initially attracted Mathers' wrath by saying that domestic violence was a bad thing. Wow, yes, what a bitch! You can't blame old Marshall for being mad at her, though. He has, after all, been given the impression by his female fans that nothing presses their buttons half as much as the idea of women being raped and murdered. The over-educated novelist Zadie Smith drools on about him like an overheated eight-year-old with a Ricky Martin fixation; Daphne and Celeste dream of marrying him - though, oddly, for two young women who are excited by such a threatening performer, they were reduced to tears earlier this year when a few plastic bottles were thrown at them at a pop festival. Rape and murder of women - good; throwing plastic bottles at them - bad. Is this what they call pretzel logic?</p> <p> Mind you, this bilge came after a decade of shameful nonsense from the music press, which, being nerdy white boys par excellence, saw in rap music a quick, convenient way to feel well hard. There has always been the odd song about the advisability of killing one's 'woman' (Delilah, Hey Joe, Where The Wild Roses Grow), but with the development of gangsta rap in the late 80s, the wholesale rape, torture and killing of women became almost mandatory. Not so much moon and June, as slice and dice. Suddenly, gently-raised boys called Ben and Tim discovered the 'bitch slap', and their guilt about being white could be forgotten. As it ever was, from Elvis to the Police, it is the whiter-than-white Eminem who has taken a music of black origin and had the greatest success with it.</p> <p> But, as black musicians seek to escape the straitjacket of violence, Eminem shows no sign of growing up. His most notorious song details the murder and disposal of his wife, Kim, and features their daughter, Haley, singing babyishly over the litany of abuse as her father explains how he is about to throw her mother's body in the river. If Eminem had been singing about killing a black man, say, and throwing his body in the river, would Zadie Smith still be wetting herself over him? And if not, why not? Why is it 'black humour' to sing about killing a white woman, but a horrible sin if the fictional victim is a black man? And, to confuse matters, what if Kim had been black? Would the song have then still been acceptable (she's still a bitch, after all) or not (oops, but she's from an ethnic minority)? </p> <p> The point I am trying to make is not that domestic violence is 'worse' than racial violence, but that they are equally bad. It makes no moral sense to laugh at and excuse one and to revile the other. There are certainly more sexual hate crimes than racial hate crimes: two women a week in the UK are murdered by their partners; men who kill their wives are routinely let off with a pat on the head and a suspended sentence. If the white killers of black people were treated so lightly, there would quite rightly be riots. The judges who consider wife-murder a mere trifle didn't need Eminem to get them into such a filthy state, but it does demonstrate that, far from being 'rebel' music, a youth culture that finds domestic violence funny and cool is merely echoing the dominant and ultraconservative values of the establishment.</p> <p> The same establishment, let us not forget, ennobled Sean Connery, who once said, 'To slap a woman is not the cruellest thing you can do to her.' (Imagine if he had suggested the same treatment for uppity immigrants - do you think he would have got that gong?) Then there was the highly respected lady novelist, recently created a life peer, who said she 'cheered' when, in The Archers, a vicious male character struck his girlfriend - she was, opined the Lady, 'unbearably smug' and thus deserved it. And don't let's forget the woman who owns the River Cafe, who said that her favourite way to spend an evening in was with something eggy on a tray 'and something fascinating on TV, like the OJ trial', as if it were some superior soap. Would she have said the same about the trial of the policemen who beat up Rodney King - that it was a great accompaniment to a quiet supper? And Rodney King didn't even die. </p> <p> Simpson was a wife-beater long known to the LAPD. Like all wife-beaters, he was a sad little man made momentarily powerful by superior strength. When a man hits a woman - and I speak from personal experience - he seeks to blot out his own totally understandable lack of self-esteem in a moment of dominance. For that short period of seeing abject fear on the face of another person, he becomes John Wayne. And, like John Wayne, he is often full of righteous, if not justified anger: she did this, she didn't do that, she deserves it. When a man hits a woman, he seeks to remove her identity; she becomes an object, a child, something to be 'dealt' with. What he does instead is remove his own, and in raising his hand instantly negates all the centuries of civilisation and privilege that have been his, thereby becoming a beast. </p> <p> Despite whatever self-righteous alibi he may have been serving himself, he knows this, and his self-esteem plummets even lower, calling for yet another fix of fear inflicting. And so it goes on. Worldwide, domestic violence causes more deaths of women aged 15-44 than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents and war. A quarter of women in this country will experience violence from a partner at some point in their lives. Domestic violence often starts or escalates during pregnancy. What a piece of work is Man. There are three times as many animal shelters in the US as there are refuges for battered women and their children.

But the vegetables were another matter - the combination of children and the green stuff is a minefield at the best of times, and Rosie, being unfamiliar with the black arts of child-rearing, couldn't get her head around how you go about persuading uncooperative kids that veg: a) aren't poisonous; and b) can actually be edible. Then she had the brainwave that has, at some time or other, come to all parents: offer a reward (aka, bribe) for eating their greens.</p> <p>Even so, when Rosie rolled up at the Smiths' country cottage in Wixford, near Stratford-upon-Avon, she was confident that she had this particular culinary crisis licked: she would offer Claira, eight, and Hatty, 12 going on 13, three main dishes - Malay pancakes, fried fish with vegetable r\u00f6sti, and vegetable frittata - followed by two puds, one of them so full of chocolate that it would silence even the sweetest-toothed of kids.</p> <p>Or at least that was the idea, until Carolyn brought Rosie back to earth by explaining how Claira deals with food that she doesn't like (that's \"like\" as in \"has never tasted before\"). \"She won't even try it,\" sighed Carolyn on the way back from picking up supplies at nearby Crabtree Farm Nurseries. \"She'll sort of dip her fork into the dish, raise it to her lips, make a pathetic impersonation of tasting it, and then say, 'See, it's horrible.'\"</p> <p>Back at the house, Rosie busied herself peeling and chopping - and having second thoughts. \"I usually do a print-out of the recipes, so you can make them after I'm gone,\" she told Carolyn, \"but I don't know how this is going to come together, so I haven't written anything down.\"</p> <p>\"You're making it up on the spot?\" said Carolyn incredulously, experience having taught her that making food for her kids without a strategy was somewhat foolhardy.</p> <p>\"I think I'll take a deep breath and rethink,\" Rosie said to no one in particular. Seconds later, a look of utter determination replaced red-cheeked fluster, and she set about her task with renewed vigour. Halfway through, Matt popped his head into the kitchen to say hello, then wisely went off to put up his feet until the children got home from school.</p> <p>Hatty turned up first, offered that mumbled greeting common to all near-teenagers, complained about a classmate (\"She smells, and everyone hates her\") and promptly disappeared to her room. \"I hope she doesn't put on that Marilyn Manson T-shirt,\" said Carolyn. Soon after, Claira arrived, announcing herself with the news that \"Sophie wants me to save her a piece of cake\".</p> <p>There was no putting off Rosie's big test any longer. \"I'm not usually this mayhemmy,\" she said, surveying the mess she'd made of the kitchen as she brought out the main dishes. \"The pancakes are because you like sweet-and-sour and peanuts, so something Malaysian seemed a good idea.

Claira took another bite. And swallowed it. Things were looking up.</p> <p>Hatty, meanwhile, had made short work of her pancake, so Rosie decided it was worth pushing her luck: \"Fancy some frittata with vegetables ... er, unmentionables?\"</p> <p>\"Okay,\" said Hatty, as Claira made a bid for freedom by claiming she needed the loo. Mum stopped her in her tracks by revealing that \"it's similar to tortilla, which you really liked in Spain\".</p> <p>Claira picked a pinenut off the top, eyed it suspiciously, then asked, \"Is this a bean? I don't like beans.\"</p> <p>\"No,\" said Rosie. \"You've had your bean quota for the day. It's a nut.\"</p> <p>\"And is that green stuff seaweed?\" grimaced Claira, now looking for any excuse.</p> <p>\"Would I do that?\" countered Rosie, slowly getting the hang of this battle of wills. \"It's spinach.\"</p> <p>Dad Matt stepped in to rescue Rosie from Claira's inquisition. \"This fish is fantastic,\" he said. \"And the r\u00f6sti.

Needless to say, Claira and Hatty ate more of the former, but seeing as they'd already put away far more than they did at normal meals, no one was complaining.</p> <p>As Rosie relaxed for the first time, Matt reiterated the dilemma: \"One of the problems with being a parent in this situation is that there isn't really a foodstuff that I don't like.\"</p> <p>\"Yes there is,\" interrupted Claira.</p> <p>\"Go on then, what?\" said Matt.</p> <p>\"Knickerbocker glory.\"</p> <p>All recipes serve four.</p> <p><b> Baked frittata </b><br></p> <p>30g butter</p> <p>2 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>6 eggs</p> <p>1 red onion, peeled and finely sliced</p> <p>2 courgettes, halved lengthways and sliced</p> <p>500g spinach, washed, destalked and roughly torn</p> <p>2 sprigs fresh basil</p> <p>180ml milk</p> <p>2 tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and diced</p> <p>2 tbsp wheatgerm</p> <p>4 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs</p> <p>30g pinenuts</p> <p>30g sunflower seeds</p> <p>2 tbsp Parmesan</p> <p>2 tbsp Gruy\u00e8re</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Sweat the onion in a tablespoon of oil and 10g butter until soft, add the courgettes and, when they are nearly soft, add the spinach and the remaining butter. Cover, cook until the spinach has wilted, then leave to cool.</p> <p>Beat the eggs and milk, and season well. Roughly chop the nuts and seeds, and mix with the breadcrumbs, wheatgerm and cheeses. Grease an ovenproof dish with the remaining oil. Stir the cooked veg into the egg mixture, then pour into the ovenproof dish. Scatter over the basil leaves, roughly torn, then cover with tomato. Scatter over the cheesy topping, and bake until set, around 25 minutes.

Cut a few slashes into the skin, then place the chicken, in a single layer, in a suitably-sized dish. Pour over the marinade, and leave for an hour, preferably much longer.</p> <p>Mix the batter ingredients and leave to stand for at least 40 minutes.</p> <p>Blanch the mangetout in boiling, salted water until they are crunchy but no longer raw. Use the same water to blanch the corn. Put the peanuts and all the vegetables, except the pepper and onion, in separate serving bowls.</p> <p>Heat a roasting tray in the oven at 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Lift the chicken from the marinade, place it skin-side down on the hot tray and roast until the skin is crisp and brown. Turn over and cook for 10 minutes more, until it is just cooked through.</p> <p>Make the pancakes one by one, and stack between greaseproof paper. Cover with a clean tea towel to keep warm.</p> <p>Once the chicken is cooked, turn up the heat to 200C/400F/gas mark 6, and transfer the chicken to a warm place. Chuck the pepper and onion on the hot tray, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes, until the onion is caramelised and the pepper soft.</p> <p>Pour the marinade into a saucepan, add the sugar and bring to the boil. Slake the cornflour in the water, then add the resulting paste to the marinade. Reduce to a thickish sauce, adding more water if it gets too stodgy. Sieve into a serving bowl. Tip the pepper/onion mix into a serving bowl. Slice the chicken and place on a platter.</p> <p>Now you're ready to eat: spread some sauce over a pancake, lie a lettuce leaf on top, then add whatever you want from the bowls around the table.

Spread out on a baking sheet and bake until crisp and lightly browned, around 20 minutes. Pour into a bowl with the brown sugar, and stir while the oats are still hot. While everything is still warm, place alternate layers of fruit, yoghurt and oats in a suitable serving bowl, ending with a layer of oats. Serve warm , or refrigerate until needed.

I don't know who was responsible for handing them out to the crowd - perhaps Peter Mandelson - but it was clearly part of a cunning plan to portray New Labour as the patriotic party, or at any rate as a more patriotic party than Old Labour, and ideally as a no less patriotic one than the Conservative party. And now, more than three years later, the government has had to go and ruin everything by welcoming as a timely contribution to the debate on race relations a report which says that the words Britain and British have racial connotations and no longer serve as a satisfactory description of this nations multicultural society. There is possibly some sensible stuff in this report by the Commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, sponsored by the Runnymede Trust, but its recommendation that we somehow renegotiate our country's name is simply dotty. How can the name of a country have racial connotations? How can an adjective that simply identifies people as its citizens be taken as a synonym for white racists? Even Germany did not think of changing its name after the Holocaust, and nobody has ever suggested that it should, even though no other country's name has had stronger racial connotations in the history of the world. Given the predictable outrage that the report has unleashed in the conservative press, and its exploitation by the Tory party as another stick with which to beat New Labour, it is worth noting what the chairman of the commission, Lord Parekh, a professor of political theory at the University of Hull, was quoted as saying two days before the report was published: Britain is a much more relaxed multi-cultural society than most others, much more at ease with itself, than almost all other European countries. There is a lot of decency, a lot of support for eliminating racism. I think we should be proud of that. Lord Parekh sounds pleased with his Britishness, as does his deputy chairman, Lady Gavron, the wife of the former chairman of the Guardian Media Group, Baron Gavron of Highgate, who said this week: I'm proud to be British. Lots of people are proud to be British, but what we were trying to say is that there are some people who don't want other people to be British, and that's racist. Not necessarily racist. Hugo Young of this newspaper, in common with millions of other people, is uncomfortable with football hooligans being British, although they are of the same race as he. I could name lots of other people as white as I am who I would rather weren't British, but I recognise that that is what they are and, unfortunately, have a perfect right to be. Lady Gavron's point is that many members of Britain's ethnic minorities, essentially those of a different colour from the majority, don't feel that they are valued members of British society and that we should all endeavour to do something about it,as indeed we should. We should be willing to assimilate them, to value them, and to respect their different cultural and religious customs so long as these are in accordance with the laws of the land and with our own cherished ideas of decency and humanity. The British identity crisis has very little to do with immigration, and nothing to do with the country's name, but a lot to do with the collapse of the old common standards among the white majority. If the immigrant population can help restore and sustain these, they will have done Britain an inestimable service.</p> <p> Jack Straw, realising the danger posed by the report to New Labour's patriotic image, hastily dissociated himself from its view of Britishness, insisting that the idea of Britain as a cohesive nation was not dead. I hope he is right. In demanding that we put all our energies into celebrating our diversity, the commission is addressing the wrong issue at the wrong time. Our priority should be to do everything we can to shore up our cohesiveness, which is having difficulty surviving both devolution in Scotland and Wales and the widespread rejection everywhere in the nation of our history and traditional values (including the tolerance that Lord Parekh so admires). As for Lady Gavron, how can one take seriously a person who derides the royal family as \"all white\" and \"part of a very unattractive hierarchy\", yet thinks all the same that we shouldn't get rid of them because \"they're fun for tourists to look at\"; and who nevertheless considers the monarchy of such symbolic importance that Prince Charles should have \"been told to marry someone black\"? One can only gasp at such frivolity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The parents of a 12-year-old boy with a passion for dance went to the high court yesterday in an attempt to make his local authority pay for lessons to train him in ballet. In a story with echoes of the hit film Billy Elliot, Jacob Youngson started ballet classes at five, stuck with them even when his two sisters dropped out, and has performed in The Nutcracker with Birmingham Royal Ballet. After keeping his talent hidden from primary school classmates, he moved on to attend a specialist arts school, with fees of \u00a311,600 a year. Yesterday the boy's parents, Sarah and Keith Youngson, asked Mr Justice Scott Baker to overturn a decision by Birmingham city council to reject their application for a grant to pay the fees. Representing the family, who live in the Birmingham suburb of Stirchley, Ramby de Mello was not slow to draw parallels with the film. \"I wondered how long it would be before you mentioned Billy Elliot,\" replied the judge drily. Mrs Youngson, who cannot work because of arthritis, and her husband, a teacher, were struggling to pay fees at Elmhurst school for dance and the performing arts in Camberley, Surrey, the court was told. Mr de Mello argued that the refusal to award a discretionary grant, on the grounds that the family had failed to demonstrate \"severe financial hardship\", was irrational, and the local authority had acted outside its powers. He said: \"Undoubtedly here there is a young boy of considerable talent - that was not at any stage disputed.\" But his only hope of becoming a top dancer, an ambition to which he was \"committed and passionate\", was by obtaining assistance. The judge heard that David Bintley, artistic director of Birmingham Royal Ballet, had written to Mr and Mrs Youngson condemning public attitudes to funding young dancers, saying they threatened to deny access to a career in the arts \"to everybody except the wealthy\". \"Children with talent who do not have the money to afford training are falling by the wayside, and the quality of young dancers who are coming through for me to select as the director of the company is suffering,\" said Mr Bintley. He was \"personally fed up with people continually calling what I do an elitist occupation, only for the rich\". Clive Sheldon, for Birmingham city council, said that it was not a question of ballet being seen as elitist; the city was under no legal obligation to provide the boy with a grant, and in its view he did not merit one when there was not an unlimited supply. The boy had auditioned for a government-funded assisted place but did not get one, Mr Sheldon continued. \"One could only speculate that there were other, better candidates. [The city] exercised its discretion rationally, in accordance with the law, and with due regard to any issues under the Human Rights Act.\" The parents had failed to demonstrate that all appropriate alternative sources of funding had been exhausted, said Mr Sheldon, or that their son could not achieve academic and dance qualifications while at a mainstream school. Outside court, Mrs Youngson said she and her husband found money for the fees by \"borrowing and going without\". Her son had had to struggle against prejudice and bullying, she added. \"He kept his dancing secret all through primary school.

The FDA is now considering whether to instruct manufacturers of cold remedies and appetite suppressants to withdraw their products from the market. PPA is used in some of the leading UK products bought from the high street chemist for colds, congestion and hayfever, including Benylin Day and Night Cold Treatment, Day Nurse, Contac 400 and Mu-Cron and Sinutab tablets. Yesterday the Medicines Control Agency, which licences drugs in the UK, said it was aware of the new evidence linking PPA to stroke. \"The committee on the safety of medicines will review the evidence and make recommendations to the MCA,\" it said in a statement.

At the end of one of the last meetings I got into a lift and just felt these eyes in my back.\" Ms Mills, who describes her partner as \"the most romantic man in the world\", had not intended to talk about her year-long relationship. But Sir Paul called the show's producers to ask if he could appear as a surprise guest. The pair met in 1999, a year after the death of Sir Paul's wife, Linda. He said: \"Obviously, I'd been going through a hard time. \"Now I've got romance back in my life. I love her, and I get a lot of pleasure from that.\"",

However, the lack of a few essential features in this residence - namely walls and a roof - would present even the most tenacious of estate agents with a challenge.</p> <p>Welcome to Park Bench, Portland Square, Bristol BS2 8QD - the official address of six rough sleepers.</p> <p>Since 1990 all NHS patients have needed a postcode to be able to permanently register with a doctor. The bureaucracy has made it difficult for rough sleepers to receive medical treatment.</p> <p>Montpelier health centre, a practice in inner-city Bristol that has many rough sleepers, came up with the idea of using the bench as a fixed address to allow homeless people to register with a GP.</p> <p>Tony Palmer, the centre's practice manager, said the idea to give the bench the same postcode as the surrounding houses was a way to dodge red tape.</p> <p>\"Homeless people were never turned away but the dummy address allows us to give rough sleepers better care because it's continuous. The best situation for a patient is to have a permanent registration.

      "bodyText": "Light, airy and centrally located, it has the making of a des res. However, the lack of a few essential features in this residence - namely walls and a roof - would present even the most tenacious of estate agents with a challenge. Welcome to Park Bench, Portland Square, Bristol BS2 8QD - the official address of six rough sleepers. Since 1990 all NHS patients have needed a postcode to be able to permanently register with a doctor. The bureaucracy has made it difficult for rough sleepers to receive medical treatment. Montpelier health centre, a practice in inner-city Bristol that has many rough sleepers, came up with the idea of using the bench as a fixed address to allow homeless people to register with a GP. Tony Palmer, the centre's practice manager, said the idea to give the bench the same postcode as the surrounding houses was a way to dodge red tape. \"Homeless people were never turned away but the dummy address allows us to give rough sleepers better care because it's continuous. The best situation for a patient is to have a permanent registration. We don't want to exclude anyone who needs medical attention within our area.\" Mr Palmer said the local health authority worked with the practice to allow the bench to be accepted as an address. Vicky O'Loughlin of Avon health authority said: \"Homeless people have very severe health problems. The average age of death for rough sleepers is something like 40 years old. Where possible, we like to get people permanently registered.\" She added that from now on, the health authority will allow rough sleepers to use \"no fixed abode\" followed by the GP's address to permanently register with a surgery. However, Louise Casey, the government's homelessness tsar, said she was \"outraged\" to hear that a park bench was being used to access medical services. She said: \"It's a good thing that the surgery is helping homeless people get treatment but it is every health authority's duty to permanently register rough sleepers with a GP, using 'no fixed abode' as an address,\" she said.",

But long may it be so: this \"realism\" is far preferable to the reality. Paul Bowes Llandinam PBowes9116@aol.com",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 In your analysis of differing phone prices no attention is given to BT's biggest pricing drawback: every call through BT is charged a 5p connection fee. That means that if one checks for e-mail several times a day, one is never paying a so-called cheap local rate. It's always 5p plus. I now regularly use One.Tel which only charges 1p a minute at all times for its internet service - and no connection fee. Selwyn Shevel \u0095 I have two phone lines, one BT, one Telewest. I get a fully itemised bill from BT. The advertised cost of calls is irrelevant and illusory.

UK fund management providers offer a range of investment trusts, or closed-ended funds, listed on the London stock exchange.

Although it differs from manager to manager, the minimum investment in investment trusts through low-cost savings schemes often starts at as low as \u00a350 a month or a \u00a3500 lump sum. There is a range of investment trusts to choose from that will deliver yields of more than 3%, substantially above the current FTSE-All Share yield of 2.2%. Some conventional investment trusts, generally in the high-income sector, may yield closer to 6%, but the trade-off is generally lower capital growth. For high-income seekers who are not too worried about capital or capital growth there are split-level shares which concentrate on income. Investing in the income shares of split capital trusts - or geared ordinary shares as they are sometimes called - can produce high income, with recent issues offering yields of 8% to 9%. There is a risk in investing in these, as the trusts use gearing - borrowing money - to enhance returns. The gearing means the benefits are greater if the market surges, but the investor stands to lose more if there is a downward movement.

Annabel Brodie Smith, spokeswoman at the Association of Investment Trust Companies, says the income shares of split-capital investment trusts offer potentially considerable yields and capital growth, but investors risk not receiving all their capital back. However, analysts suggest that wary novice investors seeking income should look to a conventional trust that is focused on the UK market. One of the more popular investment trusts among people seeking a good dividend is Temple Bar, managed by Investec. This trust invests predominantly in British companies with an above-average yield of 3.8% and has been trading on a discount to its net asset value of 8.5%. This below-average discount shows the trust is popular with investors. Also proving a top-rated trust among income seekers is Securities Trust of Scotland, managed by Martin Currie Investment Management. The trust has a balanced portfolio of UK investments and yields 3.3%. Securities Trust is trading on a wide discount of 17.4% despite its strong performance, which indicates strong buying opportunities. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at stockbroker Credit Lyonnais, says he would recommend Securities Trust of Scotland based on its ability to produce a balance of capital growth and income. Another that he recommends is Dunedin Income Growth, which yields 2.7% and has been trading on a discount of 10.9%. There are a range of higher yielding trusts, but warns that the higher the income, the lower the expected capital return is likely to be. Among the higher yielding trusts, he recommends the Glasgow Income Trust, managed by Glasgow Investment Managers, and yielding 5.7%. The trust has been selling on a discount to net asset value of 9.1%. Another in that league is the Invesco Convertible Trust, which yields 4.3% yet has had capital growth of 46% over the past five years. Earlier this week Invesco Convertible was trading on a discount of 14%. The level of this discount is also relative to its reasonable performance, which suggests a strong buying opportunity.

The Tower of London could fit into the largest biome, which is 240 metres wide and 55 metres high.</p> <p>The Eden Project has been built in the huge Bodelva china clay pit in St Austell - it will be completed by Easter 2001. Inside, it's a building site with the makings of a garden, one which aims to make us take a fresh look at our relationship with plants.</p> <p>Around 2m people in the UK are braving the elements and carving out a horticultural career. \"And it's a growing industry,\" quips Tom Keay, temperate curator at the Eden Project. Mr Keay stumbled across horticulture one summer when he got a job with the Royal Parks in London. \"I remember thinking: 'This is amazing: people earn their living looking after plants'. From that moment on I knew that was the sort of work I really enjoyed: being outdoors growing things,\" he says.</p> <p>He went on to Bath University to take a degree in horticulture. \"You do a lot of plant biology and management skills,\" he explains. \"But doing a degree broadened my horizons. I thought that horticulture was garden and park management, but I started looking at the whole landscape. It doesn't matter whether it's a nature reserve, a beach or reclaiming china clay waste areas in Cornwall, it's a lot more than gardening.\"</p> <p>\"It's all about having green fingers,\" says Adrian Lovatt, the outdoor supervisor at Eden. Asked if he really expects anyone to believe the green fingers myth, he says adamantly: \"It's something you're born with.\" He was born in the Isles of Scilly and his father worked as a head gardener. After a degree in botany at London University, he worked in a nursery and then went to the National Trust as a trainee gardener. He went on to do the Kew Diploma, a three-year course at the famous gardens in west London.</p> <p>\"When I was at Kew, I started hearing whispers in the press about Eden. This job was advertised in Horticulture Week. As much as I loved historic gardens, there was always this gap in my career where I couldn't focus on plants, but Eden satisfies that. The Eden Project is unique in the way it's linking plants and people. Every health problem that humans are ever going to face could be cured by plants, but we've got to rediscover the ingredients, and that could take years of research.\"</p> <p>Someone else who followed the Eden story a long time ago is Paul Watson. He worked as a welder for 10 years. \"But I always grew vegetables at home and went to garden centres,\" he admits. \"Then I heard about the Eden Project and one morning I thought: 'Sod it, I'm not welding anymore.'\" He is happy doing the work, which can involve anything from laying paths and developing the area known as \"Wild Cornwall\", to planting eucalyptus trees. \"Peace and satisfaction mean more than money,\" he says philosophically.</p> <p>\"And the plants are quite happy,\" says Emma Ball, who works as a draughtswoman. She points out different areas in the 55-metre high tropical biome. \"That's Amazonia, coming into West Africa. We're in Malaysia; there'll be mango trees and ginger and nutmeg. Over there is Cornucopia, with chewing gum, bamboo, rubber, palms, bananas, sugar cane, coffee and timber. We've thought about having paddy fields going up the sides. And that's the waterfall,\" she says. There's nothing to see yet, but Emma, who went to Pershore College, can smell the possibilities.</p> <p>If the area sounds like paradise that's because, to lots of people, it is. The Lost Gardens of Heligan, the restored Victorian garden sitting atop a ravine filled with sub-tropical plants, is spiritually linked to Eden. It's just down the road in Mevagissey, where Peter Stafford, managing director, has nurtured not just a host of unusual plants, but a horizontal management structure that encourages gardeners to air their views. \"We've cho sen to get away from the hierarchical structure that existed in a Victorian garden,\" he says.</p> <p>\"In Victorian times people stayed working on the same estate. We've got people who come to us with training, enthusiasm and passion, but they're not going to stay here all their life. All we can do is give people responsibility for what they create, rather than telling them what to do,\" he says.</p> <p>But he has difficulty recruiting people. \"We could use someone in the vegetable garden; someone with a particular expertise in pruning and seasonality; someone who can bring together the manure at the right time, and the stuff for the pine- apple pits.</p> <p>\"You've got to be able to find someone who can double-dig to recreate the soil structure that the Victorians had. There are generations of head gardeners but now they're probably 55 or 65.\"</p> <p>At Notcutts Nurseries, in Woodbridge, Suffolk, Paul Prowse is also experiencing difficulties. \"We're crying out for skilled people,\" he says. \"Horticulture is becoming a sophisticated industry. It's a mixture of the fashion industry wrapped up into media and retail.\" Mr Prowse was quick to confirm that spiky plants are in this season.</p> <p>But at specialist agency Horticruitment, partner Ray Hulme says that one explanation for the horticultural recruitment crisis is that some of the most talented graduates are being creamed off by garden website businesses. \"It could all end in tears,\" he says dramatically. With around 5,000 horticulturists on their books, Mr Hulme also bemoans the fact that some colleges are cutting corners. \"Horticulture isn't economical. There are glasshouses to maintain. Graduates just aren't getting the training they need,\" he says. There has been a trend to focus more on courses that can be studied in the classroom rather than on the ground, as it were.</p> <p>Yet a training in horticulture can be invaluable for teaching other things, explains Jill McChesney, training manager at Thrive, a charity which promotes horticulture for health. \"It can be used as an assessment tool, perhaps for someone who has had a stroke. We're getting people to do gardening to build their confidence,\" she says.</p> <p>Back at the Eden Project, it would seem that the gardeners working there really have struck gold (or china clay). Just as Heligan was developed intuitively, at Eden, intuition also plays a role. \"You've got to be able to look at a plant and think: 'There's something wrong with that,\" says Tom Keay. And while many of the Eden gardeners believe that you can learn a lot about art and horticulture at college, some things can't be learned, as Adrian Lovatt explains: \"You've got to have a feeling for plants.\" It's the green fingers theory again.</p> <p>You can visit the Eden site and visitor centre until early January, after which it will be closed until the official Easter opening.</p> <p><b>Planting the seeds of a budding career</b></p> <p>Eden started as such an in-your-wildest-dreams, blue-sky project that it was featured on Blue Peter, long ago, and spotted by Fiona Sanders (right) now supervisor of the temperate zone. \"It was just an idea. The presenters said there were people thinking of building the biggest conservatories in the world in Cornwall. They flashed up a computer image and I just thought that it would be great to work there. That was four years ago.\"</p> <p>After a stint as a gardener at Torbay hospital, Ms Sanders saw her job advertised in the Western Morning News. \"It's a dream job,\" she says. \"Although it's a Millennium project and people are sceptical about it, it's going to be here for years and years. I'm not going to say it's the new Kew Gardens because Kew has so much history, but in the future this will rival what Kew does and it'll be known throughout the world. Hopefully it will really count for something when people see it on your CV, and one day I would hope that I would be able to work abroad,\" she says.</p> <p>And forget office politics - gardeners don't have hidden agendas, according to Ms Sanders, who explains that they've got no time for politics, they just tend to get on with the job. \"It's a very relaxed working atmosphere,\" she says. \"And people listen to your point of view. What you say counts for something and there are never any hard feelings.\"</p> <p><b>Who to call</b></p> <p>The Eden Project: <a href=\"http://www.edenproject.com</p><p>The\" target=\"_NEW\">www.edenproject.com </a></p> <p>The Royal Horticultural Society: <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk</p><p>Institute\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rhs.org.uk </a></p> <p>Institute of Horticulture: <a href=\"http://www.horticulture.demon.co.uk</p><p>The\" target=\"_NEW\">www.horticulture.demon.co.uk </a> <br><br> The Lost Gardens of Heligan: <a href=\"http://www.heligan.com</p><p>\" target=\"_NEW\">www.heligan.com </a></p> <p>Thrive: <a href=\"http://www.thrive.org.uk</p><p>\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thrive.org.uk </a></p> <p>Horticruitment: <a href=\"http://www.horticruitment.com  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.horticruitment.com </a></p>",

Mr Keay stumbled across horticulture one summer when he got a job with the Royal Parks in London. \"I remember thinking: 'This is amazing: people earn their living looking after plants'. From that moment on I knew that was the sort of work I really enjoyed: being outdoors growing things,\" he says. He went on to Bath University to take a degree in horticulture. \"You do a lot of plant biology and management skills,\" he explains. \"But doing a degree broadened my horizons. I thought that horticulture was garden and park management, but I started looking at the whole landscape. It doesn't matter whether it's a nature reserve, a beach or reclaiming china clay waste areas in Cornwall, it's a lot more than gardening.\" \"It's all about having green fingers,\" says Adrian Lovatt, the outdoor supervisor at Eden. Asked if he really expects anyone to believe the green fingers myth, he says adamantly: \"It's something you're born with.\" He was born in the Isles of Scilly and his father worked as a head gardener. After a degree in botany at London University, he worked in a nursery and then went to the National Trust as a trainee gardener. He went on to do the Kew Diploma, a three-year course at the famous gardens in west London. \"When I was at Kew, I started hearing whispers in the press about Eden. This job was advertised in Horticulture Week. As much as I loved historic gardens, there was always this gap in my career where I couldn't focus on plants, but Eden satisfies that. The Eden Project is unique in the way it's linking plants and people. Every health problem that humans are ever going to face could be cured by plants, but we've got to rediscover the ingredients, and that could take years of research.\" Someone else who followed the Eden story a long time ago is Paul Watson. He worked as a welder for 10 years. \"But I always grew vegetables at home and went to garden centres,\" he admits. \"Then I heard about the Eden Project and one morning I thought: 'Sod it, I'm not welding anymore.'\" He is happy doing the work, which can involve anything from laying paths and developing the area known as \"Wild Cornwall\", to planting eucalyptus trees. \"Peace and satisfaction mean more than money,\" he says philosophically. \"And the plants are quite happy,\" says Emma Ball, who works as a draughtswoman. She points out different areas in the 55-metre high tropical biome. \"That's Amazonia, coming into West Africa. We're in Malaysia; there'll be mango trees and ginger and nutmeg. Over there is Cornucopia, with chewing gum, bamboo, rubber, palms, bananas, sugar cane, coffee and timber. We've thought about having paddy fields going up the sides. And that's the waterfall,\" she says. There's nothing to see yet, but Emma, who went to Pershore College, can smell the possibilities. If the area sounds like paradise that's because, to lots of people, it is. The Lost Gardens of Heligan, the restored Victorian garden sitting atop a ravine filled with sub-tropical plants, is spiritually linked to Eden. It's just down the road in Mevagissey, where Peter Stafford, managing director, has nurtured not just a host of unusual plants, but a horizontal management structure that encourages gardeners to air their views. \"We've cho sen to get away from the hierarchical structure that existed in a Victorian garden,\" he says. \"In Victorian times people stayed working on the same estate. We've got people who come to us with training, enthusiasm and passion, but they're not going to stay here all their life. All we can do is give people responsibility for what they create, rather than telling them what to do,\" he says. But he has difficulty recruiting people. \"We could use someone in the vegetable garden; someone with a particular expertise in pruning and seasonality; someone who can bring together the manure at the right time, and the stuff for the pine- apple pits. \"You've got to be able to find someone who can double-dig to recreate the soil structure that the Victorians had. There are generations of head gardeners but now they're probably 55 or 65.\" At Notcutts Nurseries, in Woodbridge, Suffolk, Paul Prowse is also experiencing difficulties. \"We're crying out for skilled people,\" he says. \"Horticulture is becoming a sophisticated industry. It's a mixture of the fashion industry wrapped up into media and retail.\" Mr Prowse was quick to confirm that spiky plants are in this season. But at specialist agency Horticruitment, partner Ray Hulme says that one explanation for the horticultural recruitment crisis is that some of the most talented graduates are being creamed off by garden website businesses. \"It could all end in tears,\" he says dramatically. With around 5,000 horticulturists on their books, Mr Hulme also bemoans the fact that some colleges are cutting corners. \"Horticulture isn't economical. There are glasshouses to maintain. Graduates just aren't getting the training they need,\" he says. There has been a trend to focus more on courses that can be studied in the classroom rather than on the ground, as it were. Yet a training in horticulture can be invaluable for teaching other things, explains Jill McChesney, training manager at Thrive, a charity which promotes horticulture for health. \"It can be used as an assessment tool, perhaps for someone who has had a stroke. We're getting people to do gardening to build their confidence,\" she says. Back at the Eden Project, it would seem that the gardeners working there really have struck gold (or china clay). Just as Heligan was developed intuitively, at Eden, intuition also plays a role. \"You've got to be able to look at a plant and think: 'There's something wrong with that,\" says Tom Keay. And while many of the Eden gardeners believe that you can learn a lot about art and horticulture at college, some things can't be learned, as Adrian Lovatt explains: \"You've got to have a feeling for plants.\" It's the green fingers theory again. You can visit the Eden site and visitor centre until early January, after which it will be closed until the official Easter opening. Planting the seeds of a budding career Eden started as such an in-your-wildest-dreams, blue-sky project that it was featured on Blue Peter, long ago, and spotted by Fiona Sanders (right) now supervisor of the temperate zone. \"It was just an idea. The presenters said there were people thinking of building the biggest conservatories in the world in Cornwall. They flashed up a computer image and I just thought that it would be great to work there. That was four years ago.\" After a stint as a gardener at Torbay hospital, Ms Sanders saw her job advertised in the Western Morning News. \"It's a dream job,\" she says. \"Although it's a Millennium project and people are sceptical about it, it's going to be here for years and years. I'm not going to say it's the new Kew Gardens because Kew has so much history, but in the future this will rival what Kew does and it'll be known throughout the world. Hopefully it will really count for something when people see it on your CV, and one day I would hope that I would be able to work abroad,\" she says. And forget office politics - gardeners don't have hidden agendas, according to Ms Sanders, who explains that they've got no time for politics, they just tend to get on with the job. \"It's a very relaxed working atmosphere,\" she says. \"And people listen to your point of view. What you say counts for something and there are never any hard feelings.\" Who to call The Eden Project: www.edenproject.com The Royal Horticultural Society: www.rhs.org.uk Institute of Horticulture: www.horticulture.demon.co.uk The Lost Gardens of Heligan: www.heligan.com Thrive: www.thrive.org.uk Horticruitment: www.horticruitment.com",

      "body": "<p>If the right to criticise one's own country is a mark of citizenship, then the response to the Report on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain might be said to prove one of its points: that some British citizens remain, in some eyes, more equal than others. That, at least, is how Bhikhu Parekh, chair of the commission which issued the report, sees it. As he said at its launch last week, there are Britons who are still made to feel \"welcome tenants rather than fellow owners of the country\". </p> <p>\"One might have thought,\" read one letter in the Daily Telegraph taking issue with the report's discussion of Britishness, \"that Lord Parekh's 40-year connection with this country would at least have taught him that presuming to tell your hosts what to call themselves is an act of atrocious bad manners\". \"I'm not a tenant,\" Parekh objects. \"I've put down my roots here. As somebody who has been in Britain for 40 years and raised his children and grandchildren here, I have as much right as that person to take part in a national conversation about what Britain should be like.\" </p> <p>The Parekh report, the consensus of the Runnymede Trust's two-year, 23-member commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, was unveiled as the most comprehensive review of British identity and race relations since Labour came to power in 1997. Taking stock of a Britain unsettled not only by post-Windrush migration but by devolution, globalisation and the EU, it argues against the notion of a monolithic \"majority culture\", painting a subtly differentiated picture of all ethnic groups - including white Britons. </p> <p>Yet the row about Britishness it has sparked, and political manoeuvring over \"patriotism\", threaten to eclipse the recommendations, which span the gamut of public life, from stop-and-search and asylum to political representation. Also obscured is that this is the first report to try to get to grips with discrimination over cultural or religious difference, not simply \"biological\" race, as a form of racism. </p> <p>\"I was prepared for strong criticisms and disagreement; it's a forthright document,\" says Parekh, emeritus professor of political theory at Hull university and a Labour life peer since May. \"But I was not prepared for raw racism, resentment and hostility, and for some press coverage that tried to discredit not just the report but the commissioners. That distressed and surprised me. It's like being told: 'Know your place in this society; don't get too big for your boots'.\" </p> <p>Parekh says he is disappointed by the \"ambiguous and contradictory\" response of the home secretary, Jack Straw, who launched the independent commission in 1997 and initially welcomed the report, but then distanced the government from at least some of its findings. \"Even if he had distanced himself from the pages on Britishness, he could have given a lead to the country by concentrating on the bits he felt were a creative contribution to national debate, instead of giving the impression he shares the rightwing view that the report shouldn't be taken seriously.\" </p> <p>Parekh, a lifelong Labour supporter, also rejects Straw's claim that the left has turned its back on patriotism, leaving the field to the right. \"A nation's history is a matter of both pride and shame; mindless celebration is hardly an answer,\" he says. \"For the right, patriotism means only stressing what's wonderful. For the left, it also means criticising what's unworthy of the country and fighting to change it. What could be more patriotic? It's not nationalist breast-beating, but saying I love something so much I can't bear to see it scarred by racism.\" </p> <p>Criticism has focused on the report's statement that Britishness \"has systematic, largely unspoken, racial connotations\". (BBC1's Michael Parkinson was not alone in understanding that to mean \"all things English or British are racist\".) Though Parekh regrets that section was not \"more explicit about what we were and were not saying\", he believes \"two and a half pages out of 416 have been latched onto and used to preempt debate and close minds\". </p> <p>He says: \"There's a confusion between 'racial' and 'racist' connotations, and that we're trying to get rid of the word 'British'. But we say the conception has been associated with whites for historical reasons and this is slowly changing. We don't want the destruction of Britain; there's no doubt that Britain should be a nation - a cohesive community with a collective identity and purpose. But given its diversity, what kind of national community can we hope to create? We need to balance the demands of the national community with those of communities within it.\" </p> <p>That balance is what Parekh, now 65, has devoted much of his life to seeking. He is one of the world's leading theorists on the philosophical underpinnings of multiculturalism - the conundrum of how to nurture ethnic diversity within a cohesive state. As he points out in his latest book, Rethinking Multiculturalism, published in July, the stakes are high: the price of failure has been violence and break-up from Yugoslavia to Rwanda. While writing books on thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham, Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi, he has been a public intellectual on three continents: in the India of his birth, Britain, and in north America as a visiting professor in Canada and the United States, including time at Harvard in 1996. He sees himself \"as a philosopher, and as providing an intellectual framework for multiculturalism - drawing on my Indian and western backgrounds, and having lived in several cultures over 40 years\". </p> <p>He is chiefly known as a sympathetic critic of the political doctrine of liberalism, which he sees as having \"a strong missionary thrust still today\". Liberalism alone, he argues, is inadequate as a basis for multiculturalism. Far from seeing other cultures as having to be tolerated or assimilated, he believes they are crucial aids to understanding and evaluating one's own. \"If the dominant western culture has no interlocutor,\" he says, \"it lives in a hall of mirrors.\" </p> <p>The imprint of his thought is evident in the report's view of Britain as both \"a community of citizens and a community of communities\" - both liberal and pluralist - and its emphasis on culture in shaping, though not determining, people's lives. One commissioner, Sir Peter Newsam, former director of London university's Institute of Education, says: \"Bhikhu resisted asking 'what are we going to do?' all the time; he said, 'how are we asking people to think?' It's a slower process, but more important in the long run.\" Another, Stuart Hall, emeritus professor of sociology at the Open University, sees Parekh as \"one of the few people who've been thinking out difficult issues at the heart of everyday racism around cultural matters - halal meat, never cutting your hair - where people experience difference in a gut, irrational but deeply important way.\" </p> <p>Hall, who sees Parekh's recent book as a \"work of profound compassion, commitment and cross-cultural understanding\", says the author is \"critical of the blindness of the liberal democratic tradition to race, difference and other cultures, but he's never dismissed it. He's a genuine relativist in that he understands the world as composed of different but inter-related cultures, each with something profound to give, and he tries to form a bridge, while knowing that for us to live together there have to be over-arching institutions.\" </p> <p>While all main party leaders now claim to \"celebrate\" diversity (William Hague among them), that leaves open the question of just how different people are allowed to be. Parekh and others ask whether such celebration is merely superficial and conditional: we'll celebrate our difference as long as \"you\" behave like \"us\". Though society, Parekh writes in the report's preface, must foster a common sense of belonging and a shared identity, it must also \"respect deep moral differences\". The \"common values\" necessary to resolve cultural disputes, cannot \"simply be the values of one community, even if it is the numerical 'majority'\". </p> <p>He says: \"When people talk about a single national culture into which everyone must assimilate, they say, 'You've come to Britain, so be proud of our history; we built an empire.' We might say, 'Wait a minute; our countries were invaded, we were bought and sold.' But that dissident view is not accepted. If Britishness equals acceptance of national culture, you're saying, 'think of this country exactly the way we do'. It's a nationalistic argument that has no space for diversity of understanding and interpretation.\" </p> <p>Parekh's belief in the existence of common values means his brand of relativism does not rule out moral stands on issues from wearing veils and turbans to polygamy and female genital mutilation. As he said in a lecture at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in June: \"Respect for a culture does not mean one refrains from criticising or passing judgment.\" </p> <p>He brings the same independence to his dealings with community-minded south Asians, who named him British Asian of the Year in 1992, and held a dinner this year in honour of his elevation as Baron Parekh of Kingston-upon-Hull. Lord Desai, professor of economics at the LSE, deems Parekh unique among prominent Asian academics in Britain (who include Desai and Amartya Sen) in being both \"a distinguished intellectual and very rooted and active in the Asian community; most British Asians prominent in the commu nity are industrialists. Bhikhu's of a different cut.\" </p> <p>The journalist Yasmin Alibhai Brown, a commissioner and close friend, though wary of what she sees as Parekh's \"idealised view of community\", attests to his readiness to \"lay into people at posh gatherings\". Receiving the BBC's special lifetime achievement award in its Asian Success awards last year, Parekh lambasted the celebration of Britain's \"300 Asian millionaires\" as vulgar and crude. He said: \"Let us make money by all means, but let us not... make it the most important value in our lives.\" </p> <p>Parekh's style lends credence to this view. A small, brisk yet warmly courteous man, who talks in lucid, analytical bullet points (his aim is transparency, since \"everything evasive is a cheat\"), he places high value on the life of the mind. Friends and colleagues describe a \"Gandhian\" simplicity and spirituality - the name Bhikhu means \"one who owns nothing\". According to one friend, Parekh \"lives a completely humble life; there's nothing in his house to do with defining himself through material objects\", while Hall is sure he \"prizes that he's a professor more than that he's a lord\". </p> <p>Although Parekh admits \"a deep feel for the spiritual, for transcendence\" and \"great respect for religious sensibility\", he says, \"God has never interested me intellectually - whether the big God of monotheisms or the small gods of Hinduism\". His life, which he sees as a string of contingencies and accidents, is symptomatic of a shrinking world that has brought cultures increasingly into contact and collision. It reveals a leap within a generation from an Indian villager born into a hereditary caste of goldsmiths to a professor and lord at Westminster. </p> <p>Born in 1935 into a \"lower-middle-class\" Hindu family in Amalsad, a village in southern Gujarat, Parekh was the eldest of five brothers. But he feels his life was marked by the infant deaths of three elder siblings before he was born. \"I was the centre of my parents' attention and anxiety. They made it clear I had to lead the lives of my dead brothers and sister - to achieve as much in one life as in four.\" </p> <p>His goldsmith father, Chhotalal, had only two years' schooling, but his tutoring put his eldest son far ahead at school. \"I became a vehicle of my father's ambition, and his constant companion from the age of four. I grew up feeling very loved and precious, which I regret now; it gave a degree of self-importance.\" While their relationship was stormy (\"If I didn't perform, the old man would get upset\"), his mother, Gajaraben, was \"a source of deep emotional serenity\" - which he now sees as having drawbacks: \"I avoid competitiveness or insecurities. Because of my childhood, and also being a migrant, I'm looking for total commitment; for relationships that are deeply nourishing and non-threatening. That's often not forthcoming in England, so I withdraw into a world of abstract ideas that do your bidding.\" </p> <p> Aged 12 at independence in 1947, Parekh was more affected by Gandhi's assassination the following year. \"It was taken for granted independence was coming, but Gandhi's murder, and by a Hindu, was a terrible surprise, just when the country was recovering from the trauma of partition and needed his healing touch.\" </p> <p>Parekh was destined for the family business but, spurred by his headmaster, an urban \"Gandhi-ite\", he became the first in his extended family to go to college. He found Bombay university, which he entered at only 15, \"overwhelming; I was completely lost and bereft of social etiquette - a villager let loose\". A Gujarati speaker, he had only three years of English, decreed the medium of Indian higher education by Lord Macaulay in 1835. He persevered (\"My father said become a bank clerk\") and found a mentor in a veteran of Gandhi's civil disobedience campaign: the economics professor Usha Mehta, who was legendary for having run an underground radio station and, says Parekh, for being captured and tortured by the British (\"People called her a 'pocketful of dynamite' because she was under five foot and very beautiful\"). Mehta, a friend till her death last month, persuaded Parekh to go to the LSE. </p> <p>While at his first teaching post, at Baroda university, Parekh fell in love with a student at his lectures, Pramila Dalal. After initial opposition from her higher-caste family, the wedding was agreed, but her grandfather bucked under social pressure. \"He was going to go back on his word, so we had no choice. She left home and, in half an hour, we were married.\" Within two months of eloping, the couple left for England. Their ship docked on October 2 1959 - Gandhi's birthday. Parekh says his father \"committed almost his entire life savings for me and my wife to come here\", then wrote to him every week \"saying how much he missed me and expected me to do well\". Lord Desai recalls the student Parekh as \"an effervescent, ebullient chap who was obviously interested in ideas - an intellectual in a real sense\". </p> <p>Parekh's PhD was on the Utilitarian Jeremy Bentham and the idea of equality in 19th-century English political thought. He traces an early sense of injustice to growing up in the shadow of Gandhi, who campaigned for the \"untouchables\" he called harijans, or \"children of god\". While Parekh lists virtues in the culture that nurtured him - warmth and affection in the family and outside, decency, high ideals - he also witnessed caste as a scourge. \"It was heartrending even as a boy to see the vulnerability of elderly women we weren't allowed to touch, or even allow their shadows to fall on us,\" he says. \"Because I was brought up to feel precious, I felt physically sick if someone was treated as dirt or in a demeaning way. Even now, when something triggers off those memories, I feel an intense anger.\" </p> <p>He also argued with his father over the goldsmith's dual role as a pawnbroker. \"It was immensely exploitative; illiterate people mortgaging their ornaments would get half their value and never be able to redeem them. My father realised this was unethical; later in life he had a profound sense of remorse.\" Aged 95 and 87, Parekh's father and mother recently followed his three surviving brothers to the US, where they have established a charitable family foundation, to which Parekh contributes. Its projects include a school for lower-caste children in a Gujarati coastal town. </p> <p>Parekh's interest in equality had another source. In his maiden speech in the Lords in July, he was frank about his \"ambivalence\" at entering Westminster as one who had spent his formative years \"in the shadow of British rule in India\". As he put it: \"Several members of your lordships' house governed my country with great wisdom and humility; others left something to be desired.\" He says: \"What I was looking for was a philosophical defence of equality, which I see as a profoundly modern idea. All the people on whom I've written are concerned with it - Bentham, Marx, Gandhi, Hannah Arendt - and now multiculturalism, which is a plea for equality of cultures.\" </p> <p>He set about exposing the \"pretensions of liberalism: why does it claim to be the dominant world view of all times, though it wasn't found in the west till the 17th century, nor in other great civilisations?\" He claims a \"systematic assumption that there is only one 'good life' runs right through western political thought\", from Plato to liberal individualism and Marxism. Cultures are \"never seen as equal conversational partners\", and this, he believes, is why \"liberals like Locke, Mill and De Tocqueville had no difficulty justifying colonialism. But did they never feel other communities might have a similar right to their way of life?\" </p> <p>\"Liberalism is a great doctrine but it's also profoundly limited,\" he adds. \"We shouldn't underestimate the virtues of traditionalist or religious ways of thinking; I want to bring liberalism into creative dialogue with other ways of thinking.\" </p> <p>He found in Gandhi the \"paradigm of the multicultural spirit. He was one of the most westernised of Indian leaders; orthodox Hindus hate him for borrowing too much from Christianity. His greatest ideas, like satyagraha [nonviolent resistance], were neither Christian nor Hindu, but came from the creative interplay of the two. Like me, Gandhi lived in two cultures, spending three years in Britain and 21 in South Africa.\" </p> <p>When Parekh and his wife arrived in London, they had trouble finding digs (\"They'd hear your accent on the phone and tell you, 'Sorry, the place is gone'\"). They found refuge with other Indian students in \"a little India in the heart of Hampstead\". Parekh is ambivalent: \"For the first three years, I never felt I was in London. It was lonely outside and you could retreat into a warm Indian ghetto, but it also stunted one's growth. I didn't have the carefree student life; the whole world of pop music is completely alien to me. And I came married and didn't go out with English girls, so for years they remained a mystery, too. Because of that experience, I value communities as a necessary island of sanity, but I'm suspicious of their turning into ghettos.\" </p> <p>In 1964 Parekh became a lecturer in Hull, where his wife became a race equality worker. Lord Plant, former master of St Catherine's College, Oxford, and now professor of political philosophy at Southampton university, was a doctoral student of Parekh's, whom he recalls as an inspiration - \"very clear, analytical and meticulous\". Parekh says: \"Almost all my colleagues were English; there were no Indian students, and barely 20 Indian families. I've always felt bicultural: an integral part of the Indian community and also fully integrated into British society.\" He volunteers that his three sons, Raj, Nitin and Anant - who all won scholarships to Oxford - are married to white women. </p> <p>In the deteriorating climate of race relations in the late 60s and 70s, BBC2 commissioned a season of prime-time talks on Multiracial Britain, broadcast in 1977. Parekh, who followed Stuart Hall and Trevor Huddleston, argued that immigration was a boon to the country's flagging economy. The Observer's television critic, Clive James, wrote: \"For people apt to delude themselves that Enoch Powell is a distinguished speaker, here was an example of what a truly distinguished speaker sounds like.\" \"It touched a liberal nerve,\" recalls Parekh. \"That was my entry into British public life.\" He sat on the Rampton/Swann committee on the educational problems of ethnic minority children in 1978-81. </p> <p>But then Parekh returned to India as vice-chancellor of Baroda university in 1981-84, after 22 years in Britain. \"I felt the urge to find myself a second home,\" he says. \"It was partly a reaction to racism; I didn't feel threatened, but it's part of Asian memory. It was a return journey into a country I thought I knew well, only to discover it had changed, and I'd changed. There were many moments of culture shock.\" </p> <p>He received death threats from those among the 27,000 students who wanted degrees without exams and were \"in the habit of acting like a mafia\". (They told his wife they would be sending her a bag with her husband's bones.) He says, \"In times of crisis you can summon up the deepest reserves.\" </p> <p>Back in Britain, Parekh joined the Commission for Racial Equality, where he was widely seen as its intellectual force, as deputy chair in 1985-90, and acting chair for a year in 1988. His profile soared at the onset of the Rushdie affair, when he lamented that Muslim criticisms of The Satanic Verses had been ignored until the Bradford book-burning, when they were branded Nazis. In a New Statesman article headlined \"Between holy text and moral void\" in March 1989 - the month after Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa - he wrote: \"If the much-maligned peasants of Bradford protest in ignorance of the book, many of those who lecture them could also do with a little humility.\" In his view: \"We have taken centuries to learn how to explore sexuality in literature without becoming either puritanical or pornographic. Religion requires a greater degree of sensitivity.\" </p> <p>According to Professor Tariq Modood, director of Bristol University's centre for the study of ethnicity and citizenship, who worked with Parekh at the CRE, Parekh created awareness that \"it was important to air the Muslims' cause in public if we wanted to be a society in which difference was respected. He offered a reasoned alternative to the prevailing view of free speech versus the fanatics.\" </p> <p>\"I like to think I played an important role in getting white society to appreciate the Muslim point of view and vice versa,\" says Parekh, who suggested that Rushdie withhold the paperback as a peacemaking concession which fell short of a ban or withdrawal of the book. \"I was unequivocal in condemning the threat to Rushdie's life, but the Muslims had put important issues on the agenda, and as an intellectual, it was my job to articulate them.\" </p> <p>Parekh was in turn accused by Hindus of tarnishing Gandhi's reputation in his book Colonialism, Tradition and Reform (1989), in which he discussed the Mahatma's testing of his celibacy by sleeping naked with women. The author recalls \"a few nasty phone calls\" and being punched at a town hall, but accepted comparison with Rushdie only in that \"Rushdie is exploring how Islam came into being, and I am exploring how India came into being\". Parekh praised much of The Satanic Verses for its exploration of the migrant's \"joys and tortures of harbouring several selves\". He reflects: \"As a migrant you have an enormous degree of freedom. No culture, no community can own you. One is at home in both India and Britain - in India I put on a dhoti [loincloth] and talk in Gujarati and Sanskrit. Yet in neither is one totally at ease; there's a sense of homelessness that's a source of joy and alienation.\" </p> <p>For some critics, Parekh's accent on culture and community is mistaken; dialogue with \"community representatives\" raises questions of power and privilege - not least of gender - within groups. For others, such as Paul Gilroy, professor of sociology and African American studies at Yale, Parekh's critique of liberalism does not go far enough. He has, says Gilroy, \"worked to make liberalism more hospitable\" without taking full account of the \"damage done to it by race-thinking in the past\".

      "bodyText": "If the right to criticise one's own country is a mark of citizenship, then the response to the Report on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain might be said to prove one of its points: that some British citizens remain, in some eyes, more equal than others. That, at least, is how Bhikhu Parekh, chair of the commission which issued the report, sees it. As he said at its launch last week, there are Britons who are still made to feel \"welcome tenants rather than fellow owners of the country\". \"One might have thought,\" read one letter in the Daily Telegraph taking issue with the report's discussion of Britishness, \"that Lord Parekh's 40-year connection with this country would at least have taught him that presuming to tell your hosts what to call themselves is an act of atrocious bad manners\". \"I'm not a tenant,\" Parekh objects. \"I've put down my roots here. As somebody who has been in Britain for 40 years and raised his children and grandchildren here, I have as much right as that person to take part in a national conversation about what Britain should be like.\" The Parekh report, the consensus of the Runnymede Trust's two-year, 23-member commission on the Future of Multi-ethnic Britain, was unveiled as the most comprehensive review of British identity and race relations since Labour came to power in 1997. Taking stock of a Britain unsettled not only by post-Windrush migration but by devolution, globalisation and the EU, it argues against the notion of a monolithic \"majority culture\", painting a subtly differentiated picture of all ethnic groups - including white Britons. Yet the row about Britishness it has sparked, and political manoeuvring over \"patriotism\", threaten to eclipse the recommendations, which span the gamut of public life, from stop-and-search and asylum to political representation. Also obscured is that this is the first report to try to get to grips with discrimination over cultural or religious difference, not simply \"biological\" race, as a form of racism. \"I was prepared for strong criticisms and disagreement; it's a forthright document,\" says Parekh, emeritus professor of political theory at Hull university and a Labour life peer since May. \"But I was not prepared for raw racism, resentment and hostility, and for some press coverage that tried to discredit not just the report but the commissioners. That distressed and surprised me. It's like being told: 'Know your place in this society; don't get too big for your boots'.\" Parekh says he is disappointed by the \"ambiguous and contradictory\" response of the home secretary, Jack Straw, who launched the independent commission in 1997 and initially welcomed the report, but then distanced the government from at least some of its findings. \"Even if he had distanced himself from the pages on Britishness, he could have given a lead to the country by concentrating on the bits he felt were a creative contribution to national debate, instead of giving the impression he shares the rightwing view that the report shouldn't be taken seriously.\" Parekh, a lifelong Labour supporter, also rejects Straw's claim that the left has turned its back on patriotism, leaving the field to the right. \"A nation's history is a matter of both pride and shame; mindless celebration is hardly an answer,\" he says. \"For the right, patriotism means only stressing what's wonderful. For the left, it also means criticising what's unworthy of the country and fighting to change it. What could be more patriotic? It's not nationalist breast-beating, but saying I love something so much I can't bear to see it scarred by racism.\" Criticism has focused on the report's statement that Britishness \"has systematic, largely unspoken, racial connotations\". (BBC1's Michael Parkinson was not alone in understanding that to mean \"all things English or British are racist\".) Though Parekh regrets that section was not \"more explicit about what we were and were not saying\", he believes \"two and a half pages out of 416 have been latched onto and used to preempt debate and close minds\". He says: \"There's a confusion between 'racial' and 'racist' connotations, and that we're trying to get rid of the word 'British'. But we say the conception has been associated with whites for historical reasons and this is slowly changing. We don't want the destruction of Britain; there's no doubt that Britain should be a nation - a cohesive community with a collective identity and purpose. But given its diversity, what kind of national community can we hope to create? We need to balance the demands of the national community with those of communities within it.\" That balance is what Parekh, now 65, has devoted much of his life to seeking. He is one of the world's leading theorists on the philosophical underpinnings of multiculturalism - the conundrum of how to nurture ethnic diversity within a cohesive state. As he points out in his latest book, Rethinking Multiculturalism, published in July, the stakes are high: the price of failure has been violence and break-up from Yugoslavia to Rwanda. While writing books on thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham, Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi, he has been a public intellectual on three continents: in the India of his birth, Britain, and in north America as a visiting professor in Canada and the United States, including time at Harvard in 1996. He sees himself \"as a philosopher, and as providing an intellectual framework for multiculturalism - drawing on my Indian and western backgrounds, and having lived in several cultures over 40 years\". He is chiefly known as a sympathetic critic of the political doctrine of liberalism, which he sees as having \"a strong missionary thrust still today\". Liberalism alone, he argues, is inadequate as a basis for multiculturalism. Far from seeing other cultures as having to be tolerated or assimilated, he believes they are crucial aids to understanding and evaluating one's own. \"If the dominant western culture has no interlocutor,\" he says, \"it lives in a hall of mirrors.\" The imprint of his thought is evident in the report's view of Britain as both \"a community of citizens and a community of communities\" - both liberal and pluralist - and its emphasis on culture in shaping, though not determining, people's lives. One commissioner, Sir Peter Newsam, former director of London university's Institute of Education, says: \"Bhikhu resisted asking 'what are we going to do?' all the time; he said, 'how are we asking people to think?' It's a slower process, but more important in the long run.\" Another, Stuart Hall, emeritus professor of sociology at the Open University, sees Parekh as \"one of the few people who've been thinking out difficult issues at the heart of everyday racism around cultural matters - halal meat, never cutting your hair - where people experience difference in a gut, irrational but deeply important way.\" Hall, who sees Parekh's recent book as a \"work of profound compassion, commitment and cross-cultural understanding\", says the author is \"critical of the blindness of the liberal democratic tradition to race, difference and other cultures, but he's never dismissed it. He's a genuine relativist in that he understands the world as composed of different but inter-related cultures, each with something profound to give, and he tries to form a bridge, while knowing that for us to live together there have to be over-arching institutions.\" While all main party leaders now claim to \"celebrate\" diversity (William Hague among them), that leaves open the question of just how different people are allowed to be. Parekh and others ask whether such celebration is merely superficial and conditional: we'll celebrate our difference as long as \"you\" behave like \"us\". Though society, Parekh writes in the report's preface, must foster a common sense of belonging and a shared identity, it must also \"respect deep moral differences\". The \"common values\" necessary to resolve cultural disputes, cannot \"simply be the values of one community, even if it is the numerical 'majority'\". He says: \"When people talk about a single national culture into which everyone must assimilate, they say, 'You've come to Britain, so be proud of our history; we built an empire.' We might say, 'Wait a minute; our countries were invaded, we were bought and sold.' But that dissident view is not accepted. If Britishness equals acceptance of national culture, you're saying, 'think of this country exactly the way we do'. It's a nationalistic argument that has no space for diversity of understanding and interpretation.\" Parekh's belief in the existence of common values means his brand of relativism does not rule out moral stands on issues from wearing veils and turbans to polygamy and female genital mutilation. As he said in a lecture at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in June: \"Respect for a culture does not mean one refrains from criticising or passing judgment.\" He brings the same independence to his dealings with community-minded south Asians, who named him British Asian of the Year in 1992, and held a dinner this year in honour of his elevation as Baron Parekh of Kingston-upon-Hull. Lord Desai, professor of economics at the LSE, deems Parekh unique among prominent Asian academics in Britain (who include Desai and Amartya Sen) in being both \"a distinguished intellectual and very rooted and active in the Asian community; most British Asians prominent in the commu nity are industrialists. Bhikhu's of a different cut.\" The journalist Yasmin Alibhai Brown, a commissioner and close friend, though wary of what she sees as Parekh's \"idealised view of community\", attests to his readiness to \"lay into people at posh gatherings\". Receiving the BBC's special lifetime achievement award in its Asian Success awards last year, Parekh lambasted the celebration of Britain's \"300 Asian millionaires\" as vulgar and crude. He said: \"Let us make money by all means, but let us not... make it the most important value in our lives.\" Parekh's style lends credence to this view. A small, brisk yet warmly courteous man, who talks in lucid, analytical bullet points (his aim is transparency, since \"everything evasive is a cheat\"), he places high value on the life of the mind. Friends and colleagues describe a \"Gandhian\" simplicity and spirituality - the name Bhikhu means \"one who owns nothing\". According to one friend, Parekh \"lives a completely humble life; there's nothing in his house to do with defining himself through material objects\", while Hall is sure he \"prizes that he's a professor more than that he's a lord\". Although Parekh admits \"a deep feel for the spiritual, for transcendence\" and \"great respect for religious sensibility\", he says, \"God has never interested me intellectually - whether the big God of monotheisms or the small gods of Hinduism\". His life, which he sees as a string of contingencies and accidents, is symptomatic of a shrinking world that has brought cultures increasingly into contact and collision. It reveals a leap within a generation from an Indian villager born into a hereditary caste of goldsmiths to a professor and lord at Westminster. Born in 1935 into a \"lower-middle-class\" Hindu family in Amalsad, a village in southern Gujarat, Parekh was the eldest of five brothers. But he feels his life was marked by the infant deaths of three elder siblings before he was born. \"I was the centre of my parents' attention and anxiety. They made it clear I had to lead the lives of my dead brothers and sister - to achieve as much in one life as in four.\" His goldsmith father, Chhotalal, had only two years' schooling, but his tutoring put his eldest son far ahead at school. \"I became a vehicle of my father's ambition, and his constant companion from the age of four. I grew up feeling very loved and precious, which I regret now; it gave a degree of self-importance.\" While their relationship was stormy (\"If I didn't perform, the old man would get upset\"), his mother, Gajaraben, was \"a source of deep emotional serenity\" - which he now sees as having drawbacks: \"I avoid competitiveness or insecurities. Because of my childhood, and also being a migrant, I'm looking for total commitment; for relationships that are deeply nourishing and non-threatening. That's often not forthcoming in England, so I withdraw into a world of abstract ideas that do your bidding.\" Aged 12 at independence in 1947, Parekh was more affected by Gandhi's assassination the following year. \"It was taken for granted independence was coming, but Gandhi's murder, and by a Hindu, was a terrible surprise, just when the country was recovering from the trauma of partition and needed his healing touch.\" Parekh was destined for the family business but, spurred by his headmaster, an urban \"Gandhi-ite\", he became the first in his extended family to go to college. He found Bombay university, which he entered at only 15, \"overwhelming; I was completely lost and bereft of social etiquette - a villager let loose\". A Gujarati speaker, he had only three years of English, decreed the medium of Indian higher education by Lord Macaulay in 1835. He persevered (\"My father said become a bank clerk\") and found a mentor in a veteran of Gandhi's civil disobedience campaign: the economics professor Usha Mehta, who was legendary for having run an underground radio station and, says Parekh, for being captured and tortured by the British (\"People called her a 'pocketful of dynamite' because she was under five foot and very beautiful\"). Mehta, a friend till her death last month, persuaded Parekh to go to the LSE. While at his first teaching post, at Baroda university, Parekh fell in love with a student at his lectures, Pramila Dalal. After initial opposition from her higher-caste family, the wedding was agreed, but her grandfather bucked under social pressure. \"He was going to go back on his word, so we had no choice. She left home and, in half an hour, we were married.\" Within two months of eloping, the couple left for England. Their ship docked on October 2 1959 - Gandhi's birthday. Parekh says his father \"committed almost his entire life savings for me and my wife to come here\", then wrote to him every week \"saying how much he missed me and expected me to do well\". Lord Desai recalls the student Parekh as \"an effervescent, ebullient chap who was obviously interested in ideas - an intellectual in a real sense\". Parekh's PhD was on the Utilitarian Jeremy Bentham and the idea of equality in 19th-century English political thought. He traces an early sense of injustice to growing up in the shadow of Gandhi, who campaigned for the \"untouchables\" he called harijans, or \"children of god\". While Parekh lists virtues in the culture that nurtured him - warmth and affection in the family and outside, decency, high ideals - he also witnessed caste as a scourge. \"It was heartrending even as a boy to see the vulnerability of elderly women we weren't allowed to touch, or even allow their shadows to fall on us,\" he says. \"Because I was brought up to feel precious, I felt physically sick if someone was treated as dirt or in a demeaning way. Even now, when something triggers off those memories, I feel an intense anger.\" He also argued with his father over the goldsmith's dual role as a pawnbroker. \"It was immensely exploitative; illiterate people mortgaging their ornaments would get half their value and never be able to redeem them. My father realised this was unethical; later in life he had a profound sense of remorse.\" Aged 95 and 87, Parekh's father and mother recently followed his three surviving brothers to the US, where they have established a charitable family foundation, to which Parekh contributes. Its projects include a school for lower-caste children in a Gujarati coastal town. Parekh's interest in equality had another source. In his maiden speech in the Lords in July, he was frank about his \"ambivalence\" at entering Westminster as one who had spent his formative years \"in the shadow of British rule in India\". As he put it: \"Several members of your lordships' house governed my country with great wisdom and humility; others left something to be desired.\" He says: \"What I was looking for was a philosophical defence of equality, which I see as a profoundly modern idea. All the people on whom I've written are concerned with it - Bentham, Marx, Gandhi, Hannah Arendt - and now multiculturalism, which is a plea for equality of cultures.\" He set about exposing the \"pretensions of liberalism: why does it claim to be the dominant world view of all times, though it wasn't found in the west till the 17th century, nor in other great civilisations?\" He claims a \"systematic assumption that there is only one 'good life' runs right through western political thought\", from Plato to liberal individualism and Marxism. Cultures are \"never seen as equal conversational partners\", and this, he believes, is why \"liberals like Locke, Mill and De Tocqueville had no difficulty justifying colonialism. But did they never feel other communities might have a similar right to their way of life?\" \"Liberalism is a great doctrine but it's also profoundly limited,\" he adds. \"We shouldn't underestimate the virtues of traditionalist or religious ways of thinking; I want to bring liberalism into creative dialogue with other ways of thinking.\" He found in Gandhi the \"paradigm of the multicultural spirit. He was one of the most westernised of Indian leaders; orthodox Hindus hate him for borrowing too much from Christianity. His greatest ideas, like satyagraha [nonviolent resistance], were neither Christian nor Hindu, but came from the creative interplay of the two. Like me, Gandhi lived in two cultures, spending three years in Britain and 21 in South Africa.\" When Parekh and his wife arrived in London, they had trouble finding digs (\"They'd hear your accent on the phone and tell you, 'Sorry, the place is gone'\"). They found refuge with other Indian students in \"a little India in the heart of Hampstead\". Parekh is ambivalent: \"For the first three years, I never felt I was in London. It was lonely outside and you could retreat into a warm Indian ghetto, but it also stunted one's growth. I didn't have the carefree student life; the whole world of pop music is completely alien to me. And I came married and didn't go out with English girls, so for years they remained a mystery, too. Because of that experience, I value communities as a necessary island of sanity, but I'm suspicious of their turning into ghettos.\" In 1964 Parekh became a lecturer in Hull, where his wife became a race equality worker. Lord Plant, former master of St Catherine's College, Oxford, and now professor of political philosophy at Southampton university, was a doctoral student of Parekh's, whom he recalls as an inspiration - \"very clear, analytical and meticulous\". Parekh says: \"Almost all my colleagues were English; there were no Indian students, and barely 20 Indian families. I've always felt bicultural: an integral part of the Indian community and also fully integrated into British society.\" He volunteers that his three sons, Raj, Nitin and Anant - who all won scholarships to Oxford - are married to white women. In the deteriorating climate of race relations in the late 60s and 70s, BBC2 commissioned a season of prime-time talks on Multiracial Britain, broadcast in 1977. Parekh, who followed Stuart Hall and Trevor Huddleston, argued that immigration was a boon to the country's flagging economy. The Observer's television critic, Clive James, wrote: \"For people apt to delude themselves that Enoch Powell is a distinguished speaker, here was an example of what a truly distinguished speaker sounds like.\" \"It touched a liberal nerve,\" recalls Parekh. \"That was my entry into British public life.\" He sat on the Rampton/Swann committee on the educational problems of ethnic minority children in 1978-81. But then Parekh returned to India as vice-chancellor of Baroda university in 1981-84, after 22 years in Britain. \"I felt the urge to find myself a second home,\" he says. \"It was partly a reaction to racism; I didn't feel threatened, but it's part of Asian memory. It was a return journey into a country I thought I knew well, only to discover it had changed, and I'd changed. There were many moments of culture shock.\" He received death threats from those among the 27,000 students who wanted degrees without exams and were \"in the habit of acting like a mafia\". (They told his wife they would be sending her a bag with her husband's bones.) He says, \"In times of crisis you can summon up the deepest reserves.\" Back in Britain, Parekh joined the Commission for Racial Equality, where he was widely seen as its intellectual force, as deputy chair in 1985-90, and acting chair for a year in 1988. His profile soared at the onset of the Rushdie affair, when he lamented that Muslim criticisms of The Satanic Verses had been ignored until the Bradford book-burning, when they were branded Nazis. In a New Statesman article headlined \"Between holy text and moral void\" in March 1989 - the month after Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa - he wrote: \"If the much-maligned peasants of Bradford protest in ignorance of the book, many of those who lecture them could also do with a little humility.\" In his view: \"We have taken centuries to learn how to explore sexuality in literature without becoming either puritanical or pornographic. Religion requires a greater degree of sensitivity.\" According to Professor Tariq Modood, director of Bristol University's centre for the study of ethnicity and citizenship, who worked with Parekh at the CRE, Parekh created awareness that \"it was important to air the Muslims' cause in public if we wanted to be a society in which difference was respected. He offered a reasoned alternative to the prevailing view of free speech versus the fanatics.\" \"I like to think I played an important role in getting white society to appreciate the Muslim point of view and vice versa,\" says Parekh, who suggested that Rushdie withhold the paperback as a peacemaking concession which fell short of a ban or withdrawal of the book. \"I was unequivocal in condemning the threat to Rushdie's life, but the Muslims had put important issues on the agenda, and as an intellectual, it was my job to articulate them.\" Parekh was in turn accused by Hindus of tarnishing Gandhi's reputation in his book Colonialism, Tradition and Reform (1989), in which he discussed the Mahatma's testing of his celibacy by sleeping naked with women. The author recalls \"a few nasty phone calls\" and being punched at a town hall, but accepted comparison with Rushdie only in that \"Rushdie is exploring how Islam came into being, and I am exploring how India came into being\". Parekh praised much of The Satanic Verses for its exploration of the migrant's \"joys and tortures of harbouring several selves\". He reflects: \"As a migrant you have an enormous degree of freedom. No culture, no community can own you. One is at home in both India and Britain - in India I put on a dhoti [loincloth] and talk in Gujarati and Sanskrit. Yet in neither is one totally at ease; there's a sense of homelessness that's a source of joy and alienation.\" For some critics, Parekh's accent on culture and community is mistaken; dialogue with \"community representatives\" raises questions of power and privilege - not least of gender - within groups. For others, such as Paul Gilroy, professor of sociology and African American studies at Yale, Parekh's critique of liberalism does not go far enough. He has, says Gilroy, \"worked to make liberalism more hospitable\" without taking full account of the \"damage done to it by race-thinking in the past\". Parekh's ideas, Gilroy believes, \"reveal all the strengths and weaknesses, beauty and failings, of the classic liberalism with which he is in dialogue and conflict\". Yet few who know Parekh's work doubt that he attempts to steer along difficult paths with a compassion and humanism that do not rest on a sense of the superiority of one culture over others. \"Why exoticise and pathologise other cultures, only seeing the worst side and not appreciating the practices and values that might enrich your way of life?\" he says. Commending the \"Hindu notion that dialogue is a way to truth\", he adds: \"It's in dialogue with others that you learn to recognise yourself. One can show the other that, in annihilating me, he's also degrading himself.\" Life at a glance: Bhikhu Parekh Born: January 4 1935, Gujarat, India.

Instead, it's an iron rule of nature that the tightest spaces always come complete with four witnesses in your car who are bent on your personal humiliation. There is always a massive temptation with parking to drive headfirst into a gap, mount the kerb and then plonk back down into the space. The trouble with that, however, is that there isn't normally room to do this, so you end up with your rear wheels in the gutter and your front wheels in a local shop. The biggest mistake in parallel parking (apart from attempting it in the first place) is to reverse in too steeply. When both rear wheels hit the kerb with a clonk, you know you have just scored nul points in the coolness stakes. (And there's no point pretending you're halfway through a three-point turn.) The trick is to aim for your rear lights to kiss the headlights of the person behind you. This is a light kiss, not the sort of kiss that leaves shattered teeth all over the road. When you're getting into a tight spot, you need every spare inch - so don't be shy of nudging the car in front of you. After all, that's what bumpers are for. Just be sure that your bumpers are at the same level. You don't want to shoot back in reverse and discover a pair of bull bars through your back window. A great aid to manoeuvring in tight spots is to use the reflection in a shop window opposite. This works well if you focus on the gap between you and the next car. It doesn't work quite so well if you focus on the lovely pair of shoes at a special low price. Only people who park on the street outside their house every day have got it sussed. The only time the rest of us will manage it is in a parallel and much larger universe.",

Let's deal first with the most banal of those: the price tag. It is \u00a38.99. Now, that's not obscene, but it is heading in the direction of a tenner. Then there is the country of origin: Chile. Good things have been said about Chile. Now things get really tantalising. The wine comes not just from Chile but from a specific vineyard area called Casablanca. Our connoisseur's eyes light up. Casablanca is getting a reputation, acquiring status as one of the 'in' regions, such as Marlborough in New Zealand or Napa in California. Finally, and perhaps what clinches the deal, is the fact that the wine announces itself as a 'wild ferment' specimen. This means that the juice is not inoculated with a commercial yeast, as most wines are, but left to ferment - that is, the yeast goes through the process of turning the sugar into alcohol - via whatever native yeast strains are already present on the skins of the grapes and inhabit the winery. </p> <p>All of this information is readily available on the label, the main heading of which reads Errazuriz Wild Ferment Chardonnay Casablanca 1998. What is not is its retailer, Oddbins, its rating, 17 points (out of 20), or its cork, plastic, which guarantees that no bottle will be tainted. What is also not conclusive until the liquid is in the glass is that our connoisseur, for once, has been absolutely right and has acquired a gorgeous, golden wine that represents great value for money. It has the dazzlingly improbable effect of smelling and tasting like a vivacious Meursault made in Alsace in conditions that can be found only in Provence. If our connoisseur, poor plonker that he is, comes to this conclusion, then he can only be a wine correspondent. </p> <p>After an aperitif of this order, you might think only an anticlimax could follow, but not a bit of it. Sainsbury, Tesco and Unwins (not to mention Safeway, Booths and Wine Cellar) have some splendid whites and reds, some of them the equal of the Errazuriz, others a mere whisker away. At Sainsbury, there is Bellingham Shiraz 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from South Africa, which also invites multi-regional analogy: the lovely dark fruit seems aromatically Barossa Valley, but the wine is Apulian in its finish. At the same store, Mont Gras Single Vineyard Syrah 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99), from Chile, inspires further geographical extravagance. The wine out-fruits many an Aussie Shiraz for the same money, and also out-lingers many a northern Rhne made from the same grape. This soft, aromatic, supple wine is at 100 branches only (0800 632262 for information). </p> <p>Milton Grove Cabernet Franc 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.49), from South Africa, is both mouthfilling and mindfilling. A sunny, joyful wine, it has delicious restraint courtesy of the civilising tannins. And, last at Sainsbury this week, Enofriulia Pinot Grigio Collio 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.99), from Italy, is extremely refined, yet purposeful and rich with a lovely apricot edge. </p> <p>At Tesco (and also Wine Cellar), there is Mondavi Coastal Merlot 1997 (16 points, \u00a39.99), from California. Not a typical merlot - it's not leathery or biting at first sip - and with a civilised texture that is plummy, polished and poised. </p> <p>Unwins has Canepa Cabernet Sauvignon/Malbec 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from Chile, which is juicier than some, and still manages to come in on the elegant side of playful. Unwins also has Clancy's Shiraz/ Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot/Cabernet Franc 1998 (17 points, \u00a37.99, also available at Safeway), which has excitingly well integrated and handsomely generous tannins aligned to its plum/cherry/blackberry fruit. Seven Peaks Cabernet Sauvignon 1996 (16.5 points, \u00a38.99), from the US, offers chocolate, coffee and cassis-edged fruit. It's an outstandingly mature specimen with lovely tannins. Vina Porta Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Chile, is superbly savoury and thickly textured with chocolate and cigar-smoke-laden fruit with a touch of pepper and old saddlebags. This astonishing bargain is also available at Oddbins. </p> <p>And last at Unwins (and Booths), there is Ironstone Semillon Chardonnay 1999 (17 points, \u00a36.49), from Australia, which has superbly mineralised fruit of great elegance and is quite remarkably stylish and classy for the money.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Shortly after noon on July 26, 1994, under a prickly lunch-time sun, a smartly-dressed woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\" drove a grey Audi through the police checkpoints at Kensington Palace Gardens, along the dappled and guarded tunnel of trees that is London's main diplomatic quarter, and parked a car bomb next to the Israeli embassy. The security cameras on the embassy lawn and the listening devices in the branches high above quickly picked her up. One of the embassy's grey-suited guards, who cluster and stare and fidget outside its gates, asked a nearby armed policeman of the diplomatic protection corps to challenge her.</p> <p>She told the officer she was visiting some flats next door, but that she had to go to the end of the road first, to busy Kensington High Street, to buy some cigarettes. A few seconds after she disappeared from view, in her navy jacket and skirt and matching sandals, swinging a Harrods bag, the bomb detonated. The car was thrown 50 feet; the embassy, which is built of heavy blood-red brick, lost part of its south wing. A witness in a hotel room some distance away described seeing debris rise a hundred feet above the treetops. Thirteen people were injured. The explosive was estimated as weighing 30 pounds, but the police never found a speck.</p> <p>That night, shortly after midnight, someone parked another car five miles to the north. The North Finchley High Road was quietening down: the pubs had cleared out, a few people were waiting at bus stops. Balfour House, a long, dirty, cream office building above a barber's and a shoe shop, was the second target. Behind its blinds and blank facade, it housed the London offices of, among others, the Jewish Agency for Israel, the Joint Israel Appeal and the World Zionist Organisation. A special Balfour House police unit was patrolling \"away from\" the block when the second bomb went off. The building had been strengthened against attack with slits and double doors - much of the blast blew back off its facade. Bus stops shattered and windows launched glass splinters across a quarter of a mile of a shaken-awake suburb. Six more people were injured; another burnt car chassis, this time the remains of a red Triumph Acclaim, was recovered.</p> <p>The outline of an explanation soon appeared. Just before the bombs, it was noted, the then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had shaken hands at the White House with King Hussein of Jordan. It was a year after the launch of the Oslo peace process, that was to edge along for six more years until it was halted so bloodily on the streets of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel this month. Soon after the explosions in London, a previously unknown body called the \"Jaffa Unit\" or \"Jaffa Team\" of the \"Palestinian Resistance\" said it had caused them. The motive, it was assumed, was some furious objection from Palestinians to the settlement being negotiated between their leader, Yasser Arafat, and Israel.</p> <p>Starting in January 1995, six Palestinians who lived in Britain were arrested. In October 1996, four of them were put on trial: three for \"conspiring to cause explosions\" in Britain between 1993 and 1995 (no mention was made of the actual bombings), and one for driving the Audi to the embassy. In December 1996, two of the defendants, Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, were convicted of the conspiracy charge. The other two were released. Alami and Botmeh were sentenced to 20 years in prison as Category A inmates, the most dangerous rating, followed by deportation. It was an unusually fierce penalty for the crime: a man found guilty of plotting to bomb the Syrian embassy in London the year before had got seven years.</p> <p>This Tuesday at the Court of Appeal, after weeks of violent confrontation between the Palestinians and Israel, Alami and Botmeh are to be judged again. Belatedly, they have been granted an appeal against their convictions. Even four years ago, though, the evidence against them seemed start-lingly incomplete.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after they were convicted, the press gave Alami, then a 31-year-old engineering student, and Botmeh, then a 29- year-old entrepreneur of erratic success, the stereotypical profile of devious Arab terrorists in the west. They \"had used their student status in the United Kingdom as a cover\"; they had \"acquired scientific expertise at British universities to make bombs\"; they were \"salon revolutionaries\", \"the offspring of elite families\", \"on the surface a charming and sophisticated pair with some influential friends\".</p> <p>They had both been politically active in Britain for years, campaigning against the illegal Israeli occupation and oppression in the Palestinian territories. In the mid-90s, as now, there was rising official anxiety - with accompanying anti-terrorism legislation - about foreigners plotting political violence from British boltholes. Yet Alami and Botmeh hardly seemed convincing as master terrorists. When they were first arrested and questioned, they did not provide alibis, the first defence of any properly prepared criminal. They insisted they could not remember where they were when the bombs were planted. And the two central pieces of evidence against them also suggested amateurism, rather than the expertise surely needed to attack outposts of one the world's most paranoid and well-defended nations. The Audi containing the Kensington Palace Gardens bomb had been traced back to Botmeh: he had bought the car with another man at a car auction, but arrived in a highly noticeable white vintage BMW. And bomb-making equipment had been discovered in a small storage locker near Heathrow airport rented by Alami and Botmeh; but the locker only came to light, and its contents discovered, because the pair had failed to keep up the rent.</p> <p>Both of them, just as puzzlingly, had also failed to take any of their plentiful opportunities to escape. Six months went by between the bombs and their arrest, and months more passed when they were out on bail before the trial. They travelled extensively, even abroad, but they always returned to Britain.</p> <p>The trial had its mysteries, too. In his summing-up, the judge described the 10 weeks at the Old Bailey as \"rather like trying to get a firm grip on a piece of soap in the bath\". The explosives in the Heathrow locker turned out to be too unstable and out of condition to have been used in car bombs. A map of north Finchley from a notebook of Alami's, triumphantly flourished by the prosecution, turned out to be a map of Sidon, a coastal town in Lebanon, drawn by her sister when visiting friends there. An application form found at Alami's flat in west London to join a Palestinian organisation with supposed terrorist connections turned out to be seven years old, filled in but unsent, and to refer to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a party that had renounced violence abroad since the late 70s. Yawns were spotted among the jury. An Israeli journalist was caught talking to jury members, and trying to give out a telephone number. He was seen holding his nose and scowling in court while defence witnesses gave evidence. One of these was Botmeh himself: he brought a radio- controlled model aircraft of his to court, and outlined a bizarre scheme to fly homemade explosives and medical supplies, in defiance of Israeli troops, over Gaza and the West Bank. He sounded more like a fantasist than a terrorist.</p> <p>The jury convicted him and Alami by 11 to one regardless. But the whole truth of the bombings remained elusive. For one thing, the woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\", who was too old to be Alami, has never been traced. Nor has anyone else been convicted of planting either of the bombs. And no apparent effort has been made since the trial - by the British or the Israelis - to secure these goals. All a spokesman for the Israeli embassy will say on the matter is: \"Given the fact that two of their [the bombers'] cronies are in jail, that's probably taken the wind out of their sails.\"</p> <p>In fact, such a tidy end to the affair has seemed steadily less likely. Instead, the avowed innocence of Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, and the alleged responsibility for the London bombs of others - less convenient for the Israelis - have become a cause. \"Samar and Jawad\" has become a phrase on badges and T-shirts, on the lips of traditional parliamentary campaigners (Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn), and less expected ones (the Tory ex-minister and peer Lord Gilmour), at the top of a petition that has attracted 200,000 signatures in the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, and in the Palestinian legislature, where more than 60 members have offered support. Amnesty International has \"concerns that the charges may have been politically motivated\". Gareth Peirce, who demolished the convictions of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, is acting as Alami and Botmeh's solicitor. And, perhaps most suggestively of all, there have been repeated claims ever since the bombings, from Arab and Israeli diplomats and the Jewish Board of Deputies in London, that warnings they had given MI5 about imminent attacks on Jewish targets in Britain were ignored. Alami and Botmeh, their advocates say, were arrested and convicted purely to save face for the security services.</p> <p>All evidence concerning them and the bombings was made officially secret in March 1999. A Public Interest Immunity Certificate cloaks it: neither Peirce, nor the equally revered human-rights barrister Michael Mansfield, who will be representing Alami and Botmeh in the High Court, have access. \"To exonerate them,\" says Peirce, \"we have in effect to prove who did it.\" Their supporters' theories sometimes favour Iran, an enemy of Israel at the time, and sometimes - pointing to the mysterious ease of the attacks, the absence of important embassy staff at the time, the relative lightness of the casualties - even the Israelis themselves. No film of the embassy assault has ever been recovered from its security cameras. All the debris was allegedly collected from the crater by Israeli officials in a hurry.</p> <p>At this point, the speculations enter a hall of mirrors. Were the Israelis trying to demonstrate their vulnerability to assault in Britain? Was there some internal Israeli feud going on? Or were the bombs meant to smear the Palestinian cause? The embassy spokesman calls such suggestions \"heinous\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alami and Botmeh have spent half a decade in British prisons convicted of a crime that can seem as vague and hard to deny, at times, as the descending cloud of accusations in Kafka's The Trial. Yet even Peirce admits that their experiments with explosives came \"close to a line\", between legitimate activism and something perhaps less so, \"which they never should have ventured near\".</p> <p>Botmeh is currently serving his sentence as far away as possible, it seems, from the scene of the explosions and the homes of his supporters. On the edge of Durham, among fields he never sees, Frankland prison is a hilltop stockade of floodlights and barking police dogs. On a rare sunny day, if you squint, it could be a Palestinian refugee camp - or an Israeli settler compound - on the West Bank.</p> <p>But Botmeh, who has not been interviewed by a British newspaper before, comes to the visiting room as if dressed for Friday at a firm of management consultants. He wears a Ralph Lauren rugby shirt, gold wire-rimmed glasses, pressed jeans and shoes of some softness and elegance. He is quite tall and toned-up, and carries a plastic folder under one arm. He sits down quickly, opens it, and marks the points he wishes to emphasise with brisk waves of a pencil.</p> <p>\"We know that the Israelis know I didn't do it,\" he begins, bright-eyed and crisp. \"The Israelis know me. They know my views. I spoke to lots of Jewish students here when I was a student activist.\" He bobs a foot with impatience at it all. \"The danger to the public from the bombers is still there. I want the police to go out looking, and they're not.\" He stills his foot and looks up from his file: \"These bombs were actually the worst thing that could have happened to the Palestinians since the [terrorist] events of the early 70s. In a different era, under different circumstances, we have struggled to establish to the world that we have a cause ... The bombings are totally counter-productive.\" The only beneficiaries, he says, have been Israelis of an unbending and suspicious disposition. \"Two sensible Palestinians have been put away.\"</p> <p>Botmeh came to Britain to do A-levels. That was in 1985, when he was 17; he had already graduated with honours from a private school in Bethlehem, his home town in the West Bank. He has lived in Britain ever since, acquiring degrees in electronic engineering from Leicester University and King's College, London, and intermittently trying to establish an export business, for trade in essential supplies with the Occupied Territories, called Keeton. He is married to an English woman called Elizabeth, whose father \"is a retired policeman\", we learn in Alami and Botmeh's campaign booklet.</p> <p>Beneath such well-groomed details, though, Botmeh has lived more painfully at times. \"I was beaten by soldiers at demonstrations when I was 13 or 14,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"And coming back from school. I remember once an Israeli jeep just stopped me and two other kids. The others ran off home, but the soldiers hit me with the butts of their rifles. They slapped me in the face. I was cowering on the floor. You dare not move ...\" He stands up in the tiny visiting room, as a warder paces outside each of its windows, and mimes a raised foot. \"They keep you there. Every 15 seconds, you get a blow.\"</p> <p>At Leicester University, he set up a Palestinian Society, and entered an exile world of long meetings and cold marches, Saturdays lost to conferences, endless letters sent to pin-prick consciences. The Palestinian diaspora in Britain gathers in borrowed churches and talk-heated halls, on barely reported vigils. The men, like Botmeh, do not look as activists are supposed to: they wear blazers and loafers and the expressions of careful businessmen. The women carry banners with the names of demolished Palestinian villages in impeccable letters. Everyone seems to know everyone. Everywhere there are maps of tiny slivers of territory, currently occupied or surrounded by the Israelis. \"Why would I, or Samar, ever get involved in student politics . . . and spend years campaigning peacefully,\" asks Botmeh crossly in the campaign pamphlet, \"if what we really wanted to do was use violence against Israelis in London?\" When did he first hear about the embassy bomb? He pauses, then says slowly: \"On the news at around one o'clock, on the car radio.\" What was his immediate reaction? A longer pause. \"Difficult to say ... surprised ... um ... to tell you the truth, surprised and anxious. So close to Kensington High Street - my uncle could have been passing.\"</p> <p>It took a year to establish, at least to Peirce's satisfaction, exactly what Botmeh was doing on the day of the first explosion. By sifting through mobile phone records, she traced him to Sussex; he finally remembered that he had been looking for a language school for his younger brother. Alami's memory was even vaguer - she says she still cannot account for the whole day - but the telephone archives again showed that she had been talking to her sister-in-law, from a callbox outside the library of Imperial College in London, when the bomb went off. \"I was trying to start my thesis,\" says Alami. \"I had just got back from holiday in France, and had found something interesting from 1937 to do with [my subject] water in Palestine. I heard like a loud thud. I thought it was the IRA, to be honest.\"</p> <p>She is sitting in another tight fishbowl of a visitors' room, in Holloway prison, north London. She is as elegantly turned out as Botmeh, in pink jeans and a slim cream blouse, but she has more of a jail-cell pallor. Unlike him, however, she alternates almost casual recollections with sad-eyed hints at something more despairing.</p> <p>\"Frankly, I would rather not have my name in the paper at all,\" she says quietly, arms folded. She came to Britain from Lebanon in 1984 for a quiet life. Her father was the head of the Arab Bank in Beirut, and her mother had been a pioneering female university graduate there, but Britain felt more stable. \"This country was civilised to us until the bombings, and we were to it. This is not a frontline. If I'd felt frustrated and wanted more direct action, I could have gone back to south Lebanon.\" When she belatedly heard the embassy had been attacked, she says, some time much later that hot afternoon in 1994, she just felt queasy. \"An Arab friend of mine from Bayswater said, 'Everybody is going to be rounded up.' I remember someone else saying, 'Where are we going to picket now?' \"</p> <p>Until then, Alami had followed a similar trajectory to Botmeh in Britain, of protest and professional advancement. She obtained degrees in chemical engineering from University and Imperial Colleges in London, and was writing her thesis to conclude a third, in water resources management, at nearby City University. She was strenuously involved in Palestinian student politics. \"You can't really switch off as a Palestinian,\" she says. Just claiming your identity is a political act - with consequences. A common estimate of the proportion of Palestinians who have been arrested by the Israelis in the Occupied Territories, at some point since these lands' seizure in 1967, is one in three.</p> <p>Alami first met Botmeh through activism in 1990, the year he began going out with Elizabeth. Alami and Botmeh became comrades and close friends. Even after four years in prison, even on matters of minor West Bank doctrine, it seems difficult to separate them. And in 1992, they both agree, they met the man who may have bound them together permanently. The man, they say, who bought the Audi with Botmeh. Who persuaded them to store explosives for him. Who set them up. And who has since disappeared with complete efficiency.</p> <p>It was first at a lecture in London on the Middle East that Alami says she encountered someone calling himself Rida Mughrabi, or Reda Moghrabi - the spelling seems as slippery as his precise identity, and the name was most likely false. He was middle-aged and \"engaging\", with a clean-cut jaw and heavy eyebrows. He claimed to be a West Bank exile who had fought the Israelis in southern Lebanon during the early 80s. He had subsequently lived in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and was now in Birmingham. He said he had fallen out with both Arafat and Arafat's opponents. He seemed to know a great deal about surveillance techniques, survival on the battlefield, and how to improvise explosives. \"We saw him at meetings and lectures at the School of Oriental and African Studies [in London],\" says Botmeh. \"We would go for a cup of coffee afterwards. What he said rang true.\" Did they wonder at all why this mentor had suddenly appeared? Botmeh sounds even crisper than usual: \"I wasn't going to be his best friend. I didn't scrutinise every word he said.\" Alami has a more nuanced explanation. \"In London, so many [Arab] people are coming and going. You don't check people's ID, check things out.\"</p> <p>In 1993, Botmeh did Mughrabi a favour. As a hobby and a way of making money - Botmeh's export business was struggling, and he did not have a permanent job - he had been going to car auctions for years with friends and acquaintances, and offering his experienced judgement on secondhand vehicles for a small commission. That year, he took Mughrabi to an auction in Northampton; Mughrabi bought a Renault 25. The following year, six weeks before the bombings, Mughrabi got in touch again: could Botmeh help him buy another Renault? They drove to Northampton the same day, yet this time they couldn't find anything satisfactory for the \u00a31,000 Mughrabi wanted to spend. But he was determined; the next day they went to a Milton Keynes auction instead, in Botmeh's garish white BMW, and bought the Audi.</p> <p>The Israeli embassy says that almost all of this is fiction. Botmeh helped buy the Audi, they agree, but as for Mughrabi - \"I've never seen anything proving that he existed,\" says a spokesman. At the trial, the judge appeared to share these doubts. Mughrabi may have been \"a fictitious character\", he speculated, \"carefully tailored to fit those parts of the Crown's case for which there is no answer.\"</p> <p>Yet Botmeh's signature and fingerprints were not found on the Audi's purchase documents. Instead, there were those of another man, who gave his name, almost certainly falsely, as George Davies. A man of the same name had also bought another car two days before, on his own this time, at an auction in Birmingham. It was the red Triumph Acclaim used to blow up Balfour House.</p> <p>That attack, like the embassy's, had a carefully-planned quality. A week before, a car bomb had disembowelled the offices of a Jewish charity in Argentina, leaving more than 250 casualties. The World Jewish Congress in New York had called on all Jewish institutions to take extra precautions. Balfour House, although it sits amid the usual outer London hum and bustle, has tank traps outside disguised as flower-tubs. Even today, six years after the explosions, if you stand on the pavement nearby for more than a few seconds, a lean man in a blue blazer may ask you what you are up to. He has a dry voice, and is polite. If you are lingering near the local travel agent's, for example, he may first enquire about your holiday plans. But he does not introduce himself, and his blazer is slightly too big and boxy to conceal only a wallet. If he stops you again, he will ask for your credentials, and take them, and get someone else to call your boss with less polite questions, this time about your precise reasons for being on a public street in North Finchley in broad daylight.</p> <p>In June 1994, as well as buying the cars for the attacks, \"George Davies\" also seems to have bought a decoy. That month, he collected chemicals that could be used in bomb- making from an industrial supplier in Birmingham. Birmingham, conveniently, is where Alami and Botmeh say Mughrabi was operating at the time; and these were the chemicals that ended up in their storage locker.</p> <p>It seems a clever set-up. Just as Mughrabi used Botmeh's obsessive car-buying to incriminate him, so Mughrabi used the two Palestinians' political frustrations to make them look like terrorists. Or so their defence goes. During 1993, they say, their mentor began openly discussing ways of violently resisting the Israelis in the Occupied Territories. They had been edging in the same direction, trying to think of ways they could help Palestinians there to defend themselves. \"It was a very uncertain time,\" says Alami. \"This was the aftermath of the Gulf War [when Saddam Hussein fired missiles at Israel and attracted popular Palestinian support]. There was an argument about which direction to take.\"</p> <p>Using nail varnish remover, hair dye and other household products to make explosives, and Botmeh's boyish expertise with radio-controlled model aircraft to carry them, Alami and Botmeh had been dreaming up plans for buzzing squadrons to aid besieged villages on the West Bank. The trouble was, none of it worked. Their \"experiments\" flopped in the pouring rain in an empty corner of the Derbyshire Peak District.</p> <p>The precise motivation and extent of these \"experiments\", however, has been a problem for Alami and Botmeh's defence ever since. \"Me and Samar were in London thinking, 'How can we help?' \" says Botmeh. \"The planes were a hobby. People would say, 'Could you put a camera in it? Could this be used back home?' Had we succeeded, we might have passed the information back.\" He pauses. His foot jogs. \"Our intention wasn't to harm anybody, here or back home.\"</p> <p>Alami seems more regretful. \"It's very difficult to show what we were thinking.\" A month before the bombings, she says Mughrabi called her, said he was leaving the country, and asked her to look after two boxes of ingredients for explosives. She met him in London and took them: \"I was working against my instinct. I thought things were going to go wrong within an hour of him giving them.\" She did not see him again. When, later, she re-read all her notebooks and pamphlets, all the activist ephemera that would help convict her, there was not a scrap she could pin to Mughrabi.</p> <p>At the trial, \"The jury completely blanked out after they admitted to the experiments\", says Daniel Guedalla, one of the organisers of Alami and Botmeh's campaign. Alami herself describes a sort of helpless panic overcoming her about the explosives once the embassy and Balfour House had been assaulted. \"We didn't know what to do ... Things were moving faster than we thought, and we got entangled. Jawad was under surveillance. We had things that we didn't have an explanation for.\" She stares at her hands.</p> <p>In another small stuffy room, Peirce's attic office in north London, their solicitor looks a little pained when she discusses the locker and its contents. \"There was considerable anger against Samar and Jawad from the Palestinian community, for having been so foolish,\" says Peirce, in her small, intense voice. To most English ears, their behaviour probably sounds even worse: \"These are the hardest cases for a jury here to disentangle,\" she continues, a little lined and tired, squeezed beneath a mantelpiece of invitations to receptions for unpopular causes. \"An English jury does not share the interests, the background, or the political point of view of the defendants.\"</p> <p>This time, for their appeal, Alami and Botmeh are before three judges. Much of the evidence that might clear them is still secret. Mughrabi only lives for certain in their words, despite advertisements and photofits that they placed last year in Arab newspapers. One of Alami and Botmeh's oldest supporters puts their chances as \"sixty-forty against\".</p> <p>Perhaps their best chance went at the trial. Then, the spindly case against them had to be made. Now they have to prove a negative. And it suits many interests for them to fail, for the unfathomable waters that Alami and Botmeh entered, by accident or intent, to remain just that. \"The security services,\" says Lord Gilmour, a former defence minister with a world-weary look, sitting in an ancient chair in the House of Lords, \"are more interested in covering their embarrassments than seeing justice.\"</p> <p>This may have crueller and crueller consequences.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after noon on July 26, 1994, under a prickly lunch-time sun, a smartly-dressed woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\" drove a grey Audi through the police checkpoints at Kensington Palace Gardens, along the dappled and guarded tunnel of trees that is London's main diplomatic quarter, and parked a car bomb next to the Israeli embassy. The security cameras on the embassy lawn and the listening devices in the branches high above quickly picked her up. One of the embassy's grey-suited guards, who cluster and stare and fidget outside its gates, asked a nearby armed policeman of the diplomatic protection corps to challenge her. She told the officer she was visiting some flats next door, but that she had to go to the end of the road first, to busy Kensington High Street, to buy some cigarettes. A few seconds after she disappeared from view, in her navy jacket and skirt and matching sandals, swinging a Harrods bag, the bomb detonated. The car was thrown 50 feet; the embassy, which is built of heavy blood-red brick, lost part of its south wing. A witness in a hotel room some distance away described seeing debris rise a hundred feet above the treetops. Thirteen people were injured. The explosive was estimated as weighing 30 pounds, but the police never found a speck. That night, shortly after midnight, someone parked another car five miles to the north. The North Finchley High Road was quietening down: the pubs had cleared out, a few people were waiting at bus stops. Balfour House, a long, dirty, cream office building above a barber's and a shoe shop, was the second target. Behind its blinds and blank facade, it housed the London offices of, among others, the Jewish Agency for Israel, the Joint Israel Appeal and the World Zionist Organisation. A special Balfour House police unit was patrolling \"away from\" the block when the second bomb went off. The building had been strengthened against attack with slits and double doors - much of the blast blew back off its facade. Bus stops shattered and windows launched glass splinters across a quarter of a mile of a shaken-awake suburb. Six more people were injured; another burnt car chassis, this time the remains of a red Triumph Acclaim, was recovered. The outline of an explanation soon appeared. Just before the bombs, it was noted, the then Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had shaken hands at the White House with King Hussein of Jordan. It was a year after the launch of the Oslo peace process, that was to edge along for six more years until it was halted so bloodily on the streets of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel this month. Soon after the explosions in London, a previously unknown body called the \"Jaffa Unit\" or \"Jaffa Team\" of the \"Palestinian Resistance\" said it had caused them. The motive, it was assumed, was some furious objection from Palestinians to the settlement being negotiated between their leader, Yasser Arafat, and Israel. Starting in January 1995, six Palestinians who lived in Britain were arrested. In October 1996, four of them were put on trial: three for \"conspiring to cause explosions\" in Britain between 1993 and 1995 (no mention was made of the actual bombings), and one for driving the Audi to the embassy. In December 1996, two of the defendants, Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, were convicted of the conspiracy charge. The other two were released. Alami and Botmeh were sentenced to 20 years in prison as Category A inmates, the most dangerous rating, followed by deportation. It was an unusually fierce penalty for the crime: a man found guilty of plotting to bomb the Syrian embassy in London the year before had got seven years. This Tuesday at the Court of Appeal, after weeks of violent confrontation between the Palestinians and Israel, Alami and Botmeh are to be judged again. Belatedly, they have been granted an appeal against their convictions. Even four years ago, though, the evidence against them seemed start-lingly incomplete. Nevertheless, after they were convicted, the press gave Alami, then a 31-year-old engineering student, and Botmeh, then a 29- year-old entrepreneur of erratic success, the stereotypical profile of devious Arab terrorists in the west. They \"had used their student status in the United Kingdom as a cover\"; they had \"acquired scientific expertise at British universities to make bombs\"; they were \"salon revolutionaries\", \"the offspring of elite families\", \"on the surface a charming and sophisticated pair with some influential friends\". They had both been politically active in Britain for years, campaigning against the illegal Israeli occupation and oppression in the Palestinian territories. In the mid-90s, as now, there was rising official anxiety - with accompanying anti-terrorism legislation - about foreigners plotting political violence from British boltholes. Yet Alami and Botmeh hardly seemed convincing as master terrorists. When they were first arrested and questioned, they did not provide alibis, the first defence of any properly prepared criminal. They insisted they could not remember where they were when the bombs were planted. And the two central pieces of evidence against them also suggested amateurism, rather than the expertise surely needed to attack outposts of one the world's most paranoid and well-defended nations. The Audi containing the Kensington Palace Gardens bomb had been traced back to Botmeh: he had bought the car with another man at a car auction, but arrived in a highly noticeable white vintage BMW. And bomb-making equipment had been discovered in a small storage locker near Heathrow airport rented by Alami and Botmeh; but the locker only came to light, and its contents discovered, because the pair had failed to keep up the rent. Both of them, just as puzzlingly, had also failed to take any of their plentiful opportunities to escape. Six months went by between the bombs and their arrest, and months more passed when they were out on bail before the trial. They travelled extensively, even abroad, but they always returned to Britain. The trial had its mysteries, too. In his summing-up, the judge described the 10 weeks at the Old Bailey as \"rather like trying to get a firm grip on a piece of soap in the bath\". The explosives in the Heathrow locker turned out to be too unstable and out of condition to have been used in car bombs. A map of north Finchley from a notebook of Alami's, triumphantly flourished by the prosecution, turned out to be a map of Sidon, a coastal town in Lebanon, drawn by her sister when visiting friends there. An application form found at Alami's flat in west London to join a Palestinian organisation with supposed terrorist connections turned out to be seven years old, filled in but unsent, and to refer to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a party that had renounced violence abroad since the late 70s. Yawns were spotted among the jury. An Israeli journalist was caught talking to jury members, and trying to give out a telephone number. He was seen holding his nose and scowling in court while defence witnesses gave evidence. One of these was Botmeh himself: he brought a radio- controlled model aircraft of his to court, and outlined a bizarre scheme to fly homemade explosives and medical supplies, in defiance of Israeli troops, over Gaza and the West Bank. He sounded more like a fantasist than a terrorist. The jury convicted him and Alami by 11 to one regardless. But the whole truth of the bombings remained elusive. For one thing, the woman \"of Mediterranean appearance\", who was too old to be Alami, has never been traced. Nor has anyone else been convicted of planting either of the bombs. And no apparent effort has been made since the trial - by the British or the Israelis - to secure these goals. All a spokesman for the Israeli embassy will say on the matter is: \"Given the fact that two of their [the bombers'] cronies are in jail, that's probably taken the wind out of their sails.\" In fact, such a tidy end to the affair has seemed steadily less likely. Instead, the avowed innocence of Samar Alami and Jawad Botmeh, and the alleged responsibility for the London bombs of others - less convenient for the Israelis - have become a cause. \"Samar and Jawad\" has become a phrase on badges and T-shirts, on the lips of traditional parliamentary campaigners (Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn), and less expected ones (the Tory ex-minister and peer Lord Gilmour), at the top of a petition that has attracted 200,000 signatures in the West Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, and in the Palestinian legislature, where more than 60 members have offered support. Amnesty International has \"concerns that the charges may have been politically motivated\". Gareth Peirce, who demolished the convictions of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four, is acting as Alami and Botmeh's solicitor. And, perhaps most suggestively of all, there have been repeated claims ever since the bombings, from Arab and Israeli diplomats and the Jewish Board of Deputies in London, that warnings they had given MI5 about imminent attacks on Jewish targets in Britain were ignored. Alami and Botmeh, their advocates say, were arrested and convicted purely to save face for the security services. All evidence concerning them and the bombings was made officially secret in March 1999. A Public Interest Immunity Certificate cloaks it: neither Peirce, nor the equally revered human-rights barrister Michael Mansfield, who will be representing Alami and Botmeh in the High Court, have access. \"To exonerate them,\" says Peirce, \"we have in effect to prove who did it.\" Their supporters' theories sometimes favour Iran, an enemy of Israel at the time, and sometimes - pointing to the mysterious ease of the attacks, the absence of important embassy staff at the time, the relative lightness of the casualties - even the Israelis themselves. No film of the embassy assault has ever been recovered from its security cameras. All the debris was allegedly collected from the crater by Israeli officials in a hurry. At this point, the speculations enter a hall of mirrors. Were the Israelis trying to demonstrate their vulnerability to assault in Britain? Was there some internal Israeli feud going on? Or were the bombs meant to smear the Palestinian cause? The embassy spokesman calls such suggestions \"heinous\". Meanwhile, Alami and Botmeh have spent half a decade in British prisons convicted of a crime that can seem as vague and hard to deny, at times, as the descending cloud of accusations in Kafka's The Trial. Yet even Peirce admits that their experiments with explosives came \"close to a line\", between legitimate activism and something perhaps less so, \"which they never should have ventured near\". Botmeh is currently serving his sentence as far away as possible, it seems, from the scene of the explosions and the homes of his supporters. On the edge of Durham, among fields he never sees, Frankland prison is a hilltop stockade of floodlights and barking police dogs. On a rare sunny day, if you squint, it could be a Palestinian refugee camp - or an Israeli settler compound - on the West Bank. But Botmeh, who has not been interviewed by a British newspaper before, comes to the visiting room as if dressed for Friday at a firm of management consultants. He wears a Ralph Lauren rugby shirt, gold wire-rimmed glasses, pressed jeans and shoes of some softness and elegance. He is quite tall and toned-up, and carries a plastic folder under one arm. He sits down quickly, opens it, and marks the points he wishes to emphasise with brisk waves of a pencil. \"We know that the Israelis know I didn't do it,\" he begins, bright-eyed and crisp. \"The Israelis know me. They know my views. I spoke to lots of Jewish students here when I was a student activist.\" He bobs a foot with impatience at it all. \"The danger to the public from the bombers is still there. I want the police to go out looking, and they're not.\" He stills his foot and looks up from his file: \"These bombs were actually the worst thing that could have happened to the Palestinians since the [terrorist] events of the early 70s. In a different era, under different circumstances, we have struggled to establish to the world that we have a cause ... The bombings are totally counter-productive.\" The only beneficiaries, he says, have been Israelis of an unbending and suspicious disposition. \"Two sensible Palestinians have been put away.\" Botmeh came to Britain to do A-levels. That was in 1985, when he was 17; he had already graduated with honours from a private school in Bethlehem, his home town in the West Bank. He has lived in Britain ever since, acquiring degrees in electronic engineering from Leicester University and King's College, London, and intermittently trying to establish an export business, for trade in essential supplies with the Occupied Territories, called Keeton. He is married to an English woman called Elizabeth, whose father \"is a retired policeman\", we learn in Alami and Botmeh's campaign booklet. Beneath such well-groomed details, though, Botmeh has lived more painfully at times. \"I was beaten by soldiers at demonstrations when I was 13 or 14,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"And coming back from school. I remember once an Israeli jeep just stopped me and two other kids. The others ran off home, but the soldiers hit me with the butts of their rifles. They slapped me in the face. I was cowering on the floor. You dare not move ...\" He stands up in the tiny visiting room, as a warder paces outside each of its windows, and mimes a raised foot. \"They keep you there. Every 15 seconds, you get a blow.\" At Leicester University, he set up a Palestinian Society, and entered an exile world of long meetings and cold marches, Saturdays lost to conferences, endless letters sent to pin-prick consciences. The Palestinian diaspora in Britain gathers in borrowed churches and talk-heated halls, on barely reported vigils. The men, like Botmeh, do not look as activists are supposed to: they wear blazers and loafers and the expressions of careful businessmen. The women carry banners with the names of demolished Palestinian villages in impeccable letters. Everyone seems to know everyone. Everywhere there are maps of tiny slivers of territory, currently occupied or surrounded by the Israelis. \"Why would I, or Samar, ever get involved in student politics . . . and spend years campaigning peacefully,\" asks Botmeh crossly in the campaign pamphlet, \"if what we really wanted to do was use violence against Israelis in London?\" When did he first hear about the embassy bomb? He pauses, then says slowly: \"On the news at around one o'clock, on the car radio.\" What was his immediate reaction? A longer pause. \"Difficult to say ... surprised ... um ... to tell you the truth, surprised and anxious. So close to Kensington High Street - my uncle could have been passing.\" It took a year to establish, at least to Peirce's satisfaction, exactly what Botmeh was doing on the day of the first explosion. By sifting through mobile phone records, she traced him to Sussex; he finally remembered that he had been looking for a language school for his younger brother. Alami's memory was even vaguer - she says she still cannot account for the whole day - but the telephone archives again showed that she had been talking to her sister-in-law, from a callbox outside the library of Imperial College in London, when the bomb went off. \"I was trying to start my thesis,\" says Alami. \"I had just got back from holiday in France, and had found something interesting from 1937 to do with [my subject] water in Palestine. I heard like a loud thud. I thought it was the IRA, to be honest.\" She is sitting in another tight fishbowl of a visitors' room, in Holloway prison, north London. She is as elegantly turned out as Botmeh, in pink jeans and a slim cream blouse, but she has more of a jail-cell pallor. Unlike him, however, she alternates almost casual recollections with sad-eyed hints at something more despairing. \"Frankly, I would rather not have my name in the paper at all,\" she says quietly, arms folded. She came to Britain from Lebanon in 1984 for a quiet life. Her father was the head of the Arab Bank in Beirut, and her mother had been a pioneering female university graduate there, but Britain felt more stable. \"This country was civilised to us until the bombings, and we were to it. This is not a frontline. If I'd felt frustrated and wanted more direct action, I could have gone back to south Lebanon.\" When she belatedly heard the embassy had been attacked, she says, some time much later that hot afternoon in 1994, she just felt queasy. \"An Arab friend of mine from Bayswater said, 'Everybody is going to be rounded up.' I remember someone else saying, 'Where are we going to picket now?' \" Until then, Alami had followed a similar trajectory to Botmeh in Britain, of protest and professional advancement. She obtained degrees in chemical engineering from University and Imperial Colleges in London, and was writing her thesis to conclude a third, in water resources management, at nearby City University. She was strenuously involved in Palestinian student politics. \"You can't really switch off as a Palestinian,\" she says. Just claiming your identity is a political act - with consequences. A common estimate of the proportion of Palestinians who have been arrested by the Israelis in the Occupied Territories, at some point since these lands' seizure in 1967, is one in three. Alami first met Botmeh through activism in 1990, the year he began going out with Elizabeth. Alami and Botmeh became comrades and close friends. Even after four years in prison, even on matters of minor West Bank doctrine, it seems difficult to separate them. And in 1992, they both agree, they met the man who may have bound them together permanently. The man, they say, who bought the Audi with Botmeh. Who persuaded them to store explosives for him. Who set them up. And who has since disappeared with complete efficiency. It was first at a lecture in London on the Middle East that Alami says she encountered someone calling himself Rida Mughrabi, or Reda Moghrabi - the spelling seems as slippery as his precise identity, and the name was most likely false. He was middle-aged and \"engaging\", with a clean-cut jaw and heavy eyebrows. He claimed to be a West Bank exile who had fought the Israelis in southern Lebanon during the early 80s. He had subsequently lived in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and was now in Birmingham. He said he had fallen out with both Arafat and Arafat's opponents. He seemed to know a great deal about surveillance techniques, survival on the battlefield, and how to improvise explosives. \"We saw him at meetings and lectures at the School of Oriental and African Studies [in London],\" says Botmeh. \"We would go for a cup of coffee afterwards. What he said rang true.\" Did they wonder at all why this mentor had suddenly appeared? Botmeh sounds even crisper than usual: \"I wasn't going to be his best friend. I didn't scrutinise every word he said.\" Alami has a more nuanced explanation. \"In London, so many [Arab] people are coming and going. You don't check people's ID, check things out.\" In 1993, Botmeh did Mughrabi a favour. As a hobby and a way of making money - Botmeh's export business was struggling, and he did not have a permanent job - he had been going to car auctions for years with friends and acquaintances, and offering his experienced judgement on secondhand vehicles for a small commission. That year, he took Mughrabi to an auction in Northampton; Mughrabi bought a Renault 25. The following year, six weeks before the bombings, Mughrabi got in touch again: could Botmeh help him buy another Renault? They drove to Northampton the same day, yet this time they couldn't find anything satisfactory for the \u00a31,000 Mughrabi wanted to spend. But he was determined; the next day they went to a Milton Keynes auction instead, in Botmeh's garish white BMW, and bought the Audi. The Israeli embassy says that almost all of this is fiction. Botmeh helped buy the Audi, they agree, but as for Mughrabi - \"I've never seen anything proving that he existed,\" says a spokesman. At the trial, the judge appeared to share these doubts. Mughrabi may have been \"a fictitious character\", he speculated, \"carefully tailored to fit those parts of the Crown's case for which there is no answer.\" Yet Botmeh's signature and fingerprints were not found on the Audi's purchase documents. Instead, there were those of another man, who gave his name, almost certainly falsely, as George Davies. A man of the same name had also bought another car two days before, on his own this time, at an auction in Birmingham. It was the red Triumph Acclaim used to blow up Balfour House. That attack, like the embassy's, had a carefully-planned quality. A week before, a car bomb had disembowelled the offices of a Jewish charity in Argentina, leaving more than 250 casualties. The World Jewish Congress in New York had called on all Jewish institutions to take extra precautions. Balfour House, although it sits amid the usual outer London hum and bustle, has tank traps outside disguised as flower-tubs. Even today, six years after the explosions, if you stand on the pavement nearby for more than a few seconds, a lean man in a blue blazer may ask you what you are up to. He has a dry voice, and is polite. If you are lingering near the local travel agent's, for example, he may first enquire about your holiday plans. But he does not introduce himself, and his blazer is slightly too big and boxy to conceal only a wallet. If he stops you again, he will ask for your credentials, and take them, and get someone else to call your boss with less polite questions, this time about your precise reasons for being on a public street in North Finchley in broad daylight. In June 1994, as well as buying the cars for the attacks, \"George Davies\" also seems to have bought a decoy. That month, he collected chemicals that could be used in bomb- making from an industrial supplier in Birmingham. Birmingham, conveniently, is where Alami and Botmeh say Mughrabi was operating at the time; and these were the chemicals that ended up in their storage locker. It seems a clever set-up. Just as Mughrabi used Botmeh's obsessive car-buying to incriminate him, so Mughrabi used the two Palestinians' political frustrations to make them look like terrorists. Or so their defence goes. During 1993, they say, their mentor began openly discussing ways of violently resisting the Israelis in the Occupied Territories. They had been edging in the same direction, trying to think of ways they could help Palestinians there to defend themselves. \"It was a very uncertain time,\" says Alami. \"This was the aftermath of the Gulf War [when Saddam Hussein fired missiles at Israel and attracted popular Palestinian support]. There was an argument about which direction to take.\" Using nail varnish remover, hair dye and other household products to make explosives, and Botmeh's boyish expertise with radio-controlled model aircraft to carry them, Alami and Botmeh had been dreaming up plans for buzzing squadrons to aid besieged villages on the West Bank. The trouble was, none of it worked. Their \"experiments\" flopped in the pouring rain in an empty corner of the Derbyshire Peak District. The precise motivation and extent of these \"experiments\", however, has been a problem for Alami and Botmeh's defence ever since. \"Me and Samar were in London thinking, 'How can we help?' \" says Botmeh. \"The planes were a hobby. People would say, 'Could you put a camera in it? Could this be used back home?' Had we succeeded, we might have passed the information back.\" He pauses. His foot jogs. \"Our intention wasn't to harm anybody, here or back home.\" Alami seems more regretful. \"It's very difficult to show what we were thinking.\" A month before the bombings, she says Mughrabi called her, said he was leaving the country, and asked her to look after two boxes of ingredients for explosives. She met him in London and took them: \"I was working against my instinct. I thought things were going to go wrong within an hour of him giving them.\" She did not see him again. When, later, she re-read all her notebooks and pamphlets, all the activist ephemera that would help convict her, there was not a scrap she could pin to Mughrabi. At the trial, \"The jury completely blanked out after they admitted to the experiments\", says Daniel Guedalla, one of the organisers of Alami and Botmeh's campaign. Alami herself describes a sort of helpless panic overcoming her about the explosives once the embassy and Balfour House had been assaulted. \"We didn't know what to do ... Things were moving faster than we thought, and we got entangled. Jawad was under surveillance. We had things that we didn't have an explanation for.\" She stares at her hands. In another small stuffy room, Peirce's attic office in north London, their solicitor looks a little pained when she discusses the locker and its contents. \"There was considerable anger against Samar and Jawad from the Palestinian community, for having been so foolish,\" says Peirce, in her small, intense voice. To most English ears, their behaviour probably sounds even worse: \"These are the hardest cases for a jury here to disentangle,\" she continues, a little lined and tired, squeezed beneath a mantelpiece of invitations to receptions for unpopular causes. \"An English jury does not share the interests, the background, or the political point of view of the defendants.\" This time, for their appeal, Alami and Botmeh are before three judges. Much of the evidence that might clear them is still secret. Mughrabi only lives for certain in their words, despite advertisements and photofits that they placed last year in Arab newspapers. One of Alami and Botmeh's oldest supporters puts their chances as \"sixty-forty against\". Perhaps their best chance went at the trial. Then, the spindly case against them had to be made. Now they have to prove a negative. And it suits many interests for them to fail, for the unfathomable waters that Alami and Botmeh entered, by accident or intent, to remain just that. \"The security services,\" says Lord Gilmour, a former defence minister with a world-weary look, sitting in an ancient chair in the House of Lords, \"are more interested in covering their embarrassments than seeing justice.\" This may have crueller and crueller consequences. As Peirce puts it, \"The more there are prosecutions vis-a-vis political situations abroad, the more this difficulty [of Alami and Botmeh's] is going to arise - that only the security services hold the facts which might clear them, and they consider it their job not to tell.\" Botmeh's sister, Samia, put it more concretely, one grey Saturday last month, as the Palestinian demonstration she was on chanted its way past Downing Street. If her brother and Alami's activities, however distantly they seemed linked to the events at the embassy and Balfour House, could be grounds for 20 years in prison, \"Anyone on this march could be arrested.\" Unless, perhaps, they were a man called Mughrabi, or a woman with a Harrods bag.",

Being Jewish, he presented a special challenge. Would he end up with the sheep or the goats?",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's a Wednesday evening in early summer, and you'd think some fancy soiree was taking place in Knightsbridge, west London, on beautiful lawns set back from Brompton Road. Porsches and Aston Martins are parked up, and attractive young people, even some famous names, in casual wear and summer dresses are wandering up a tree-lined drive.</p> <p>But this is no soiree. We are agnostics. We are entering a church - the Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) - to sign up for the Alpha course, led by Nicky Gumbel. He is over there, welcoming agnostics; he's good-looking, tall and slim. It sounds impossible but Gumbel's course, consisting of 10 Wednesday evenings, routinely transforms hardened unbelievers, the entrenched faithless, into confirmed Christians. There will be after-dinner talks from Gumbel, a minister at Holy Trinity as well as head of Alpha, and then we will split into small groups to discuss the meaning of life, etc. There will be a weekend away in Kidderminster. And that's it. Salvation will occur within these parameters. I cannot imagine how it can work.</p> <p>However, at a cautious estimate, in Britain alone and in less than a decade, a quarter of a million agnostics have found God through Gumbel. To name one: Jonathan Aitken. \"I am a man of unclean lips,\" he told the Catholic newspaper, the Tablet, \" ... but I went on an Alpha course at Holy Trinity Brompton, and found great inspiration from its fellowship and the teachings on the Holy Spirit.\" The Tablet added, \"He has done Alpha not once but three times, graduating from a humble student to a helper who pours coffee.\"</p> <p>Gumbel's supporters say that, within C of E circles, he is now more influential than the Archbishop of Canterbury; they claim that Alpha is saving the Church. Other people say some quite horrifying things about Nicky Gumbel. I am told it is almost impossible to get an interview with him. His diary is full until 2003. His people were apologetic. They said that the only way to really get to know Nicky, to understand how he does it, was to enrol in Alpha.</p> <p>\"Hi!\" says a woman wearing a name-tag at HTB. \"You're ... ?\"</p> <p>\"Jon Ronson.\"</p> <p>\"Jon. Let's see. Great!\" She ticks off my name and laughs. \"I know it feels strange on the first night, but don't be nervous - in a couple of weeks' time, this'll feel like home.\"</p> <p>I drift into the church. There are agnostics everywhere, eating shepherd's pie from paper plates on their laps. Michael Allison, one-time permanent private secretary to Mrs Thatcher, is here. So is an ex-England cricket captain. I spot the manager of a big British pop group. Samantha Fox found God through Nicky. I wonder whether Jonathan Aitken will pour the coffee, but he is nowhere to be seen tonight. And now Nicky is on stage, leaning against the podium, smiling hesitantly. He reminds me of Tony Blair. \"A very warm welcome to you all. Now some of you may be thinking, 'Help! What have I got myself into?'\" A laugh. \"Don't worry,\" he says. \"We're not going to pressurise you into doing anything. Perhaps some of you are sitting there sneering. If you are, please don't think that I'm looking down at you. I spent half my life as an atheist. I used to go to talks like this and I would sneer.\"</p> <p>Nicky is being disingenuous - we know that there are no talks like this - Alpha is uniquely successful, and branching out abroad, so far to 112 countries, where they play Nicky's videos and the pastor acts the part of Nicky. \"This just may be the wrong time for you,\" says Nicky to the sneerers. \"If you don't want to come along next week, that's fine. Nobody will phone you up! I'd like you to meet Pippa, my wife.\" We applaud. \"Hi!\" says Pippa. \"We've got three children. Henry is 20, there's Jonathan, and Rebecca is 15.\"</p> <p>Nicky assures us that we are not abnormal for being here. The Bible is the world's most popular book, he says. This is normal. \"Forget the modern British novelists and the TV tie-ins,\" he says, \"44 million Bibles are sold each year.\" He says that the New Testament was written when they say it was. \"We know this very accurately,\" he explains, \"through a science called textual criticism.\" He says that Jesus existed. This is historically accurate. He quotes the Jewish historian Josephus, born AD37: \"Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works ... the tribe of Christians so named after him are not extinct to this day.\" I am with Nicky thus far. My knowledge of Josephus is sketchy, but he strikes me as a reliable source. But the agnostics here - it soon becomes clear that Nicky can read our minds - are thinking, \"But none of this proves that Jesus was anything more than a human teacher.\"</p> <p>Nicky tells an anecdote: he says that he once failed to recognise that his squash partner was Paul Ackford, the England rugby international. Similarly, Jesus's disciples, in the region of Caesarea Philippi, failed to recognise that their master was the Son of God. I could live without the squash anecdote, though it presumably works for some people. Nicky says that Jesus could not have been just a great human teacher. When he was asked at his trial whether he was \"The Christ, the Son of the Living God, he replied: 'I am.'\" Nicky's point is this: a great human teacher would not claim to be the Son of God. \"You must make your choice - either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else he's a lunatic or, worse, the Devil of Hell. But don't let us come up with any patronising nonsense about his being a great moral teacher. He hasn't left that open to us. He didn't intend to.\" This final logic (a quote from one of Nicky's heroes, CS Lewis) is impressive to me. It remains in my mind.</p> <p>Then it's on to the small group. I am in Nicky's group: typically, it consists of around 10 agnostics, some from the City, some from the dot.com world, some professional sportspeople, strangers gathered together in a small room in the basement. We sit in a circle. I wonder what will happen to us in the weeks ahead. For now, we verbalise our doubts. We gang up on Nicky and his helpers: his wife, Pippa, an investment banker called James and his doctor wife, Julia, all ex-agnostics who found Christ on Alpha. We ask them antagonistic questions. \"If there's a God, why is there so much suffering?\" And: \"What about those people who have never heard of Jesus? Are you saying that all other religions are damned?\"</p> <p>Nicky just smiles and says, \"What do the other people here think?\"</p> <p>At the end of the night, Nicky hands out some pamphlets he's written called (such is the predictability of agnostics) Why Does God Allow Suffering? (answer: nobody really knows) and What About Other Religions? (answer: they will, unfortunately, go to Hell. That includes me - I am a Jew). I am enjoying myself. I drive away thinking about the things Nicky said. I play them over in my mind. But by the time I arrive home and then watch ER, my mini epiphany has all drained away and I go back to normal. I cannot imagine how any of my fellow agnostics will possibly be converted by the end of the course.</p> <p>As the weeks progress, the timetable becomes routine. Dinner, a talk from Nicky, coffee and digestives, the small groups. But the hostile questions have now become slightly less combative. One agnostic, Alice, who is the financial manager of an internet company and rides her horse every weekend in Somerset, admits to taking Nicky's pamphlets away with her on business trips. She says she reads them on the plane and finds them comforting. We talk about the excuses we give our friends for our weekly Wednesday night absences. Some say they're learning French. Others say they're on a business course. There is laughter and blushing. I miss Week Three because I am reporting on wife swapping parties in Paris. On Week Four, Nicky suggests I tell the group all about wife swapping. The group asks me lots of questions. When I fill in the details, Nicky shakes his head mournfully. \"What about the children,\" he sighs. \"So many people getting hurt.\" He's right. Nicky ends the night by saying to me: \"I think it's important that you saw something awful like that midway through Alpha.\"</p> <p>On Week Five, Nicky talks about answered prayers and how coincidences can sometimes be messages from God. He says he keeps a prayer diary and ticks them off when they are answered. As Nicky says these things, I think about my own life, about how my wife and I were told we couldn't have a baby - about how awful those years of infertility were, how every month was like a funeral without a corpse - and then we did have a baby, and thought that our son, Joel, was a gift from God.</p> <p>The moment I think about this, I hear Nicky say the word \"Joel\". I look up. Nicky is quoting from the Book of Joel: \"I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten.\" Later, I tell the group what happened. \"Ahhh,\" they say, when I get to the part about us having a baby. \"Ahhh,\" they say again, when I get to the part about Nicky saying Joel, and reading out an uncannily appropriate quote.</p> <p>\"Well?\" I say.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" Nicky smiles. \"I think you should let it sit in your heart and make your own decision.\"</p> <p>\"But what do you think?\" I say.</p> <p>\"If I had to put a bet on it,\" he says, \"coincidence or message, I'd say definitely, yes, that was a message from God.\"</p> <p>The subject is changed. \"So?\" says Nicky. \"How was everyone's week?\"</p> <p>Tony sits next to Alice. He is the most vociferous agnostic in the group. He always turns up in his business suit, straight from work, and has a hangdog expression, as if something is always troubling him.</p> <p>\"Tony?\" says Nicky. \"How was your week?\"</p> <p>\"I was talking to a homosexual friend,\" says Tony, \"and he said that ever since he was a child he found himself attracted to other boys. So why does the church think he's committing a sin? Are you going to Hell if you commit a sexual act that is completely normal to you? That seems a bit unfair, doesn't it?\" There is a murmur of agreement from the group.</p> <p>\"First of all,\" says Nicky, \"I have many wonderful homosexual friends. There's even an Alpha for gays running in Beverly Hills! Really! I think it's marvellous! But if a paedophile said, 'Ever since I was a child I found myself attracted to children', we wouldn't say that that was normal, would we?\" A small gasp. \"Now, I am not for a moment comparing homosexuals with paedophiles, but the Bible makes it very clear that sex outside marriage, including homosexual sex, is, unfortunately, a sin.\" He says he wishes it wasn't so, but the Bible makes it clear that gay people need to be healed.</p> <p>\"Although I strongly advise you not to say the word 'healed' to them,\" he quickly adds. \"They hate that word.\"</p> <p>The meeting is wound up. Nicky, Pippa and I stay around for a chat. We talk about who we feel might be on the cusp of converting. My money is on Alice.</p> <p>\"Really?\" says Nicky. \"You think Alice?\"</p> <p>\"Of course,\" I say. \"Who do you think?\"</p> <p>\"Tony,\" says Nicky.</p> <p>\"Tony?\" I say.</p> <p>\"We'll see,\" says Nicky.</p> <p>I drive home. In the middle of the night it becomes clear to me that I almost certainly had a message from God, that God had spoken to me through Nicky Gumbel.</p> <p><b> Woman leads church boycott in row over evangelical pig-snorting</b></p> <p>A woman has walked out of her church and is holding services in her living room because she says she cannot bring herself to 'snort like a pig and bark like a dog' on a Church of England course. Angie Golding, 50, claims she was denied confirmation unless she signed up for the Alpha course, which she says is a 'brainwashing' exercise where participants speak in tongues, make animal noises and then fall over. Mark Elsdon-Dew of HTB, Holy Trinity Brompton, said the Alpha course included lectures on the Holy Spirit. 'It affects different people in different ways,' he said.</p> <p><b> The Times, May 11, 1996</b></p> <p>Of course, stumbling upon this press cutting comes as a shock. I had no idea that the shepherd's pie, the nice chats, that these things seem to be leading up to something so peculiar; something that will, I guess, occur during our weekend away in Kidderminster.</p> <p>I visit Mark Elsdon-Dew, Nicky's press man. I have grown fond of Mark. \"Do anything you want,\" he frequently tells me. \"Go home, if you like. Really. Any time you want. Don't worry, I won't phone you up! Ha ha!\" Mark was once the Daily Express's news editor, but then he did Alpha and now he works for Nicky, in a Portakabin on HTB's two-and-a-half acres. Nicky has so many staff - more, even, than the Archbishop of Canterbury, says Mark - that there aren't enough offices in this giant church to accommodate them all. I want to test Mark, to see how honest he will be about the negative press. I ask him if any journalist has written disapprovingly about Nicky. \"Oh yes,\" he says excitedly. \"Hang on, let me find them for you.\" Mark rifles through his filing cabinets and retrieves a sheath of articles. \"Look at this!\" he says. \"And how about this?\" One article, from the Spectator, suggests that Nicky's organisation is akin to the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, something that looks like the C of E, acts like the C of E, but is something else, something malignant, growing, poised to consume its host: \"For now they need the Church of England for its buildings - but they are very aware that through the wealth of their parishioners they wield an influence over the established Church that far outweighs their numbers.\"</p> <p>\"If you think that's bad,\" says Mark, \"you should see this one.\" Oh good, I think. It reads: \"HTB's divorce from the real world, together with a simplistic and communal response to all problems, a strong leader, and a money-conscious hierarchy, are trademarks of a cult.\"</p> <p>\"And here's a real stinker ,\" says Mark. The Alpha Course: Is It Bible-Based Or Hell-Inspired? This last one is from the Reverend Ian Paisley. His conclusion, after 15 pages of deliberation, is that it is Hell-Inspired.</p> <p>Usually, when a discovery such as this presents itself midway through researching a story, I feel nothing but glee. On this occasion, however, the gaiety is tinged with indignation and relief - indignation that these people, this apparent cult, has managed to get under my skin, to instil in me feelings of some kind of awakening, and relief because I no longer feel the need to deal with those feelings.</p> <p>It is Saturday morning, in the countryside near Kidderminster, and Nicky is offering us the strangest invitation. He is going to beckon us into the supernatural, where he hopes we will physically feel the Holy Spirit enter our bodies. Nicky tells me that he very much hopes people will speak in tongues. \"I'm so glad you could make it,\" he tells me.</p> <p>\"I'm glad to be here,\" I say, although I am thinking, \"Are you a cult leader?\" We've been arriving all night - in BMWs and Mercedes and Porsches - at the Pioneer Centre, a residential youth club booked for the weekend. The traffic was terrible. I was stuck in a jam behind a mini-van emblazoned with the words \"Jews For Jesus\", and toyed with the idea of taking this to be another message from God, but I chose to discount it.</p> <p>We are staying in dormitories - six to a room. Nicky and Pippa are not bunking up with the flock: Nicky says he needs space to concentrate. I don't think the agnostics quite grasp the reality of what will unfold in the next 36 hours. Many are completely unaware. Tongues!? How can Nicky make this happen?</p> <p>The next morning, we laze in the sun and then we are called into the chapel, a big pine hut. Tonight, England will play Germany. Nicky takes to the stage: \"Now, some of you may be thinking, 'Help! What's going to happen?' Well, first, I hope you have a wonderful time. Enjoy the weather, enjoy the sports, but, most of all, I hope we all experience the Holy Spirit.\" Nicky says that the Holy Spirit has often been ignored by the Church, because it sounds \"weird and supernaturally evil\". He says that the Church fears change, that he once said to an elderly vicar, \"You must have seen so many changes\", and that the vicar replied, \"Yes, and I have resisted every single one of them\". We laugh.</p> <p>Nicky says that this is a shame, because when people open themselves to the Holy Spirit you can see it in their faces. \"Their faces are alive!\" Look at Bach and Handel and da Vinci, he says. They had the Holy Spirit. Whatever line of work we're in - we could be bankers,\"or journalists\"- we can be filled to overflowing. Nicky says that it is absolutely amazing. \"All relationships involve emotions. I don't say to Pippa, 'I love you intellectually'. What I say is, 'I love you with my whole being, my mind, my heart, my will'. Ah, but that's in private. The British don't display emotions in public, do they?\" There is a silence. \"Just imagine,\" he says, \"that England will score a goal tonight. I think some people will go, 'Yeaah!'\" There is more laughter. The audience is relaxed. \"If a comedy film makes us laugh out loud in the cinema, the movie is considered a success. If a tragic play makes us weep in a theatre, the play is considered a success. But if a religious service makes us weep or laugh, we are accused of emotionalism!\"</p> <p>And so it goes on, with Nicky managing to make the most alarming prospect seem acceptable. Speaking in tongues would normally be something absurd, horrific even. But imperceptibly, gracefully, Nicky is leading us there.</p> <p>We have a few hours off. We swim and play basketball. The crowd is, as always, mainly white and wealthy. A criticism levelled at Nicky by other Anglicans is that Jesus cast his net wide to embrace poor fishermen, whereas Nicky seems to concentrate on rich widows, old Etonians and young high-fliers. This annoys him even more than the accusations that he is a cult leader. He points out a group of men on the edge of the basketball court. They lean against a picket fence, watching the game with an inscrutable vigilance, huge and tanned, like a prison gang during their hour in the yard.</p> <p>\"You absolutely must meet Brian,\" says Nicky. \"He's quite amazing.\"</p> <p>Brian is not his real name. \"I was a villain,\" says Brian. \"A professional criminal.\"</p> <p>\"Were you in a firm?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"I was the firm,\" he smiles. \"Say no more.\" From Brian's demeanour - he looks the archetypal English crime boss - I don't doubt this for a moment. It makes me smile: most vicars will proudly introduce you to some redeemed petty thief in their flock; once again Nicky attracts someone from the apex of his chosen profession. Back in the 80s, Brian was caught trying to pull off an enormous importation of cannabis. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail. In 1994, while in Exeter prison, Brian heard about Alpha. To curry favour with the chaplain, he called Nicky and asked him to visit the prison. Nicky sent a team instead. \"And within weeks,\" says Brian, \"all these hard men were waving our arms around like we were in a nightclub. Can you imagine it? People getting touched by the Holy Spirit, boys I knew who got banged up for some really naughty crimes ...\"</p> <p>That was the first time a prison had run an Alpha course. Brian was transferred to Dartmoor and took Alpha with him. Other converts did the same. That's how it spread through the prison system. Today, 120 of the 158 British prisons run Alpha courses; some have six-month waiting lists.</p> <p>Then there is this, from the March 2000 Alpha newsletter: US Governor George W Bush was so impressed by the impact of Alpha in the British prison system that he wants to start a trial programme at once in Texas. \"And all that started with Brian in 1994,\" says Nicky. \"It was such an amazing year.\" Indeed it was: on January 20, 1994, at a concrete church next to Toronto airport, 80% of the congregation, apropos of nothing, suddenly fell to the floor and began writhing around, apparently singing in tongues and convulsing violently. Rumours about this milestone - which became known as the Toronto Blessing - quickly spread to Britain. Nicky flew to Toronto to see it for himself. Was it mass hysteria or a miracle, a real experience of the Holy Spirit? \"I don't talk about it now,\" says Nicky. \"It divides people. It splits churches. It is very controversial. But I'll tell you - I think the Toronto Blessing was a wonderful, wonderful thing.\" Nicky returned from Canada, spoke passionately at HTB about the Toronto Blessing and, lo and behold, his congregation, too, began rolling on the floor, etc. The services soon became so popular, with queues around the block, that they were compelled to introduce two Sunday-evening sittings - and still not everyone could get in. HTB became Britain's richest church. (It still is: last year's income was \u00a35.1m.) This evangelical euphoria lasted the year, with miracles such as Prison Alpha cropping up all over the place. And then it ebbed away.</p> <p>But its influence has lasted. The Toronto Blessing was the kick-start Alpha needed. Alpha began at HTB in 1979, as a brush-up course for rusty churchgoers. Hardly anybody attended. It trundled along, causing no ripples, until Nicky arrived in 1991. Nicky is the son of agnostics. He discovered God while studying for the Bar at Cambridge, and gave up a career as a barrister to be ordained into the C of E in 1986. He saw Alpha's potential. What if he began targeting agnostics? What if he gave it an image make-over?</p> <p>\"Nicky bought standard lamps back in 1991,\" says Mark later that afternoon. \"He took an interest in the food. There are flowers. Young, quite-pretty girls welcome you at the door. Nicky identified some very important things. First, informality. Second, the course - people like the idea of going on a course, whether it's yoga or Christianity. Third, free and easy - we don't force anything down people's throats. People have a horror of being phoned up. And, finally, boredom - we will not bore you.\"</p> <p>Nicky's new direction combined with his charisma, his dazzlingly constructed weekly talks chipping away at our doubts, and the Toronto Blessing caused Alpha's popularity to explode through the 90s. In 1992, there were five Alpha courses in Britain, 100 rusty churchgoers attended that year. By 1994 there were 26,700 attendees. By the end of last year, there were 14,200 courses around the world, with 1.5 million attendees. Nicky has sold more than one million books.</p> <p>Alice had a wedding to go to, but hopes to arrive by this evening. The rest of our group gathers on the grass, and talk about our feelings about the Holy Spirit. \"I've got to say,\" says a woman called Annie, \"the idea of speaking in tongues really freaks me out.\" Nicky nods and smiles.</p> <p>\"I agree,\" says Jeremy, who works with asylum-seekers. \"I really don't want to be seen as some kind of freak.\"</p> <p>\"You won't suddenly become weirdos,\" explains James, one of the group leaders along with his wife, Julia, Nicky and Pippa. \"You won't lose your sense of humour, or your mates, or whether you drink beer or not.\"</p> <p>\"We shouldn't get too hung up on tongues,\" adds Julia. \"Tongues is just one of the many gifts. Tony? What do you think?\"</p> <p>Tony lights a cigarette. \"Do you have to believe in God before you receive the gift?\" he says \"Because it seems strange to ask some-one you don't believe in to prove that he exists.\" I wonder what makes Nicky think that Tony is our group's best candidate for conversion.</p> <p>\"The Church likes to put God in a box,\" says James. \"The Church wants to make God safe. We think the Church has lost the plot. We just want God to be God. As the Apostle Paul said, 'I would that you all speak in tongues.'\"</p> <p>We ask if they can speak in tongues, and they all say they can. James has been speaking in tongues for several years. Julia was fearful at first, but now does it a lot. Nicky and Pippa are extremely well-versed in tongues, which, they say, literally means \"languages never learnt\". They say that on countless occasions they have heard people who can't speak Chinese, for instance, speaking in Chinese tongues. Such miracles appear to be commonplace once one enters the arena of tongues - as we will do at around 6.30pm tonight.</p> <p>At 6pm, we are back in the chapel. Nicky is on stage, telling us nothing bad will happen to us. \"You don't need to speak in tongues. It is not the most important gift. But tongues is a beginner's gift, and Alpha is a beginner's course in Christianity, so it would be wonderful if you tried.\" We steel ourselves. The door opens. It is Alice. She has missed Nicky's comforting preamble and has arrived just in time for the main event. \"If you ask for the Holy Spirit, you're not going to get something terrible,\" says Nicky. \"Shall we give it a try? Shall we ask Him?\"</p> <p>\"Mmm,\" we say, contentedly.</p> <p>Nicky softly begins: \"Please stand up and close your eyes. If there's anyone who would like to experience the Holy Spirit, maybe you're not sure, I'd like you to say a very simple prayer in your heart ... a very simple prayer ... It's okay ... I now turn from everything that is wrong ... now hold out your hands ... hold them out in front of you ... if you'd like to ... some of you might be experiencing a weight on your hands ... you might be thinking nothing's happening ... but you might be feeling a peace ... a deep peace ... that, too, is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit ... Jesus is telling you He loves you ... He died for you.\"</p> <p>This is when the first sob comes - at the front, someone begins to cry. \"I sense that some of you would like to receive the gift of tongues now.\"</p> <p>I wobble on my feet. Later, James tells me that wobbling is a possible sign of the Holy Spirit. I open my eyes for a moment and look at the group. Tony is grinning, his eyes bulging, like a schoolboy in a pompous assembly. Alice, who is entirely unprepared, is looking perplexed and uncomfortable. I close my eyes. I imagine those who have been in this spell before me, Jonathan Aitken, for instance, and the business executives and celebrities. \"Start to praise God in any language but the language you speak ... Don't worry about your neighbour. Your neighbour will be worried enough about himself ... \"</p> <p>And then the tongues begin. I thought it would be cacophonous, but it turns out to be haunting, tuneful, like some experimental opera. I think some people are cheating - I hear French: \"C'est oui. C'est oui\" - but mostly it is quite beautiful. I open my eyes again and look around. Mark, Nicky's press officer, is speaking in tongues. So are James and Julia. All these people I have known all these weeks are speaking in tongues. Tony has refrained from tongues, but he is no longer grinning, either. He is crying. Alice looks ready to explode with anger. She barges out of the chapel. \"Be a little bolder now ...\" Nicky carries on. \"Just continue to receive this wonderful opportunity ...\"</p> <p>James walks over to me: \"Is it working for you?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Well, it might have,\" I reply, truthfully, \"but the truth is, I'm a journalist, so I couldn't keep my eyes closed.\"</p> <p>\"Would you like me to pray for you?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Okay,\" I say.</p> <p>James rests his hand on my shoulder. \"Oh Jesus, I pray that Jon will receive Your wonderful spirit. God. Please come and fill Jon with ... \" It is not working. The spell has broken. I tell James again that I'm sorry, but I'm a journalist. (This is no excuse - the picture editor of a Sunday newspaper is speaking in tongues to my left, as is a producer of Channel 4 documentaries in front of me, for the first time in his life.) So James changes tack. \"Oh thank you, Jesus, for Jon's wonderfully enquiring journalistic mind ... please help Jon's career ... no, not his career ... his wonderful journalism ... and may his journalism become even more wonderful now he is working in Your name, Jesus Christ ... \"</p> <p>I tell James I'm sorry, and follow Alice outside, where half-a-dozen furious agnostics have gathered on the grass. \"Why didn't anyone tell me I'd signed up for a brainwashing cult?\" says one. \"I felt like I was in a pack of hyenas. I wanted someone to come up and ask me if I was okay, and instead someone came up and said, 'Would you like me to pray for you?'\" Alice is devastated: \"I used to think Nicky was fantastic. He really gave me room to investigate my feelings about the Lord. But now I'm thinking, just get me away from these weirdos. I've been dragged all the way out here under false pretences, and there's no escape. I am actually very, very upset.\" We turn out to be in the minority, and watch as the new converts file out of the chapel, red-eyed from crying or smiling beatifically. Tony is one such convert, but he is not smiling. In fact, he seems miserable. \"Something overwhelmed me,\" he says. \"I didn't want it to. I tried to resist it, but I couldn't.\"</p> <p>\"What was it?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"The Holy Spirit,\" says Tony.</p> <p>\"What did it feel like?\"</p> <p>\"Like when you're trying not to cry but you can't help yourself. I was thinking of all the reasons why I didn't want it to happen - you know, the Christian lifestyle - and then Nicky came over to me and started whispering in my ear.\"</p> <p>\"What did he say?\"</p> <p>\"He said, 'I sense that you have had a Christian experience in the past'. And that rocked my world, because I have, and I didn't tell anyone. That's why I came on Alpha. I wanted to decide, once and for all, yes or no. And ...\" Tony sighs discontentedly. \"God spoke to me just now. He said, 'You can come back.' \"</p> <p>\u0095 Read part two of 'Catch me if you can' <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,385173,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a Wednesday evening in early summer, and you'd think some fancy soiree was taking place in Knightsbridge, west London, on beautiful lawns set back from Brompton Road. Porsches and Aston Martins are parked up, and attractive young people, even some famous names, in casual wear and summer dresses are wandering up a tree-lined drive. But this is no soiree. We are agnostics. We are entering a church - the Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) - to sign up for the Alpha course, led by Nicky Gumbel. He is over there, welcoming agnostics; he's good-looking, tall and slim. It sounds impossible but Gumbel's course, consisting of 10 Wednesday evenings, routinely transforms hardened unbelievers, the entrenched faithless, into confirmed Christians. There will be after-dinner talks from Gumbel, a minister at Holy Trinity as well as head of Alpha, and then we will split into small groups to discuss the meaning of life, etc. There will be a weekend away in Kidderminster. And that's it. Salvation will occur within these parameters. I cannot imagine how it can work. However, at a cautious estimate, in Britain alone and in less than a decade, a quarter of a million agnostics have found God through Gumbel. To name one: Jonathan Aitken. \"I am a man of unclean lips,\" he told the Catholic newspaper, the Tablet, \" ... but I went on an Alpha course at Holy Trinity Brompton, and found great inspiration from its fellowship and the teachings on the Holy Spirit.\" The Tablet added, \"He has done Alpha not once but three times, graduating from a humble student to a helper who pours coffee.\" Gumbel's supporters say that, within C of E circles, he is now more influential than the Archbishop of Canterbury; they claim that Alpha is saving the Church. Other people say some quite horrifying things about Nicky Gumbel. I am told it is almost impossible to get an interview with him. His diary is full until 2003. His people were apologetic. They said that the only way to really get to know Nicky, to understand how he does it, was to enrol in Alpha. \"Hi!\" says a woman wearing a name-tag at HTB. \"You're ... ?\" \"Jon Ronson.\" \"Jon. Let's see. Great!\" She ticks off my name and laughs. \"I know it feels strange on the first night, but don't be nervous - in a couple of weeks' time, this'll feel like home.\" I drift into the church. There are agnostics everywhere, eating shepherd's pie from paper plates on their laps. Michael Allison, one-time permanent private secretary to Mrs Thatcher, is here. So is an ex-England cricket captain. I spot the manager of a big British pop group. Samantha Fox found God through Nicky. I wonder whether Jonathan Aitken will pour the coffee, but he is nowhere to be seen tonight. And now Nicky is on stage, leaning against the podium, smiling hesitantly. He reminds me of Tony Blair. \"A very warm welcome to you all. Now some of you may be thinking, 'Help! What have I got myself into?'\" A laugh. \"Don't worry,\" he says. \"We're not going to pressurise you into doing anything. Perhaps some of you are sitting there sneering. If you are, please don't think that I'm looking down at you. I spent half my life as an atheist. I used to go to talks like this and I would sneer.\" Nicky is being disingenuous - we know that there are no talks like this - Alpha is uniquely successful, and branching out abroad, so far to 112 countries, where they play Nicky's videos and the pastor acts the part of Nicky. \"This just may be the wrong time for you,\" says Nicky to the sneerers. \"If you don't want to come along next week, that's fine. Nobody will phone you up! I'd like you to meet Pippa, my wife.\" We applaud. \"Hi!\" says Pippa. \"We've got three children. Henry is 20, there's Jonathan, and Rebecca is 15.\" Nicky assures us that we are not abnormal for being here. The Bible is the world's most popular book, he says. This is normal. \"Forget the modern British novelists and the TV tie-ins,\" he says, \"44 million Bibles are sold each year.\" He says that the New Testament was written when they say it was. \"We know this very accurately,\" he explains, \"through a science called textual criticism.\" He says that Jesus existed. This is historically accurate. He quotes the Jewish historian Josephus, born AD37: \"Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works ... the tribe of Christians so named after him are not extinct to this day.\" I am with Nicky thus far. My knowledge of Josephus is sketchy, but he strikes me as a reliable source. But the agnostics here - it soon becomes clear that Nicky can read our minds - are thinking, \"But none of this proves that Jesus was anything more than a human teacher.\" Nicky tells an anecdote: he says that he once failed to recognise that his squash partner was Paul Ackford, the England rugby international. Similarly, Jesus's disciples, in the region of Caesarea Philippi, failed to recognise that their master was the Son of God. I could live without the squash anecdote, though it presumably works for some people. Nicky says that Jesus could not have been just a great human teacher. When he was asked at his trial whether he was \"The Christ, the Son of the Living God, he replied: 'I am.'\" Nicky's point is this: a great human teacher would not claim to be the Son of God. \"You must make your choice - either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else he's a lunatic or, worse, the Devil of Hell. But don't let us come up with any patronising nonsense about his being a great moral teacher. He hasn't left that open to us. He didn't intend to.\" This final logic (a quote from one of Nicky's heroes, CS Lewis) is impressive to me. It remains in my mind. Then it's on to the small group. I am in Nicky's group: typically, it consists of around 10 agnostics, some from the City, some from the dot.com world, some professional sportspeople, strangers gathered together in a small room in the basement. We sit in a circle. I wonder what will happen to us in the weeks ahead. For now, we verbalise our doubts. We gang up on Nicky and his helpers: his wife, Pippa, an investment banker called James and his doctor wife, Julia, all ex-agnostics who found Christ on Alpha. We ask them antagonistic questions. \"If there's a God, why is there so much suffering?\" And: \"What about those people who have never heard of Jesus? Are you saying that all other religions are damned?\" Nicky just smiles and says, \"What do the other people here think?\" At the end of the night, Nicky hands out some pamphlets he's written called (such is the predictability of agnostics) Why Does God Allow Suffering? (answer: nobody really knows) and What About Other Religions? (answer: they will, unfortunately, go to Hell. That includes me - I am a Jew). I am enjoying myself. I drive away thinking about the things Nicky said. I play them over in my mind. But by the time I arrive home and then watch ER, my mini epiphany has all drained away and I go back to normal. I cannot imagine how any of my fellow agnostics will possibly be converted by the end of the course. As the weeks progress, the timetable becomes routine. Dinner, a talk from Nicky, coffee and digestives, the small groups. But the hostile questions have now become slightly less combative. One agnostic, Alice, who is the financial manager of an internet company and rides her horse every weekend in Somerset, admits to taking Nicky's pamphlets away with her on business trips. She says she reads them on the plane and finds them comforting. We talk about the excuses we give our friends for our weekly Wednesday night absences. Some say they're learning French. Others say they're on a business course. There is laughter and blushing. I miss Week Three because I am reporting on wife swapping parties in Paris. On Week Four, Nicky suggests I tell the group all about wife swapping. The group asks me lots of questions. When I fill in the details, Nicky shakes his head mournfully. \"What about the children,\" he sighs. \"So many people getting hurt.\" He's right. Nicky ends the night by saying to me: \"I think it's important that you saw something awful like that midway through Alpha.\" On Week Five, Nicky talks about answered prayers and how coincidences can sometimes be messages from God. He says he keeps a prayer diary and ticks them off when they are answered. As Nicky says these things, I think about my own life, about how my wife and I were told we couldn't have a baby - about how awful those years of infertility were, how every month was like a funeral without a corpse - and then we did have a baby, and thought that our son, Joel, was a gift from God. The moment I think about this, I hear Nicky say the word \"Joel\". I look up. Nicky is quoting from the Book of Joel: \"I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten.\" Later, I tell the group what happened. \"Ahhh,\" they say, when I get to the part about us having a baby. \"Ahhh,\" they say again, when I get to the part about Nicky saying Joel, and reading out an uncannily appropriate quote. \"Well?\" I say. \"I don't know,\" Nicky smiles. \"I think you should let it sit in your heart and make your own decision.\" \"But what do you think?\" I say. \"If I had to put a bet on it,\" he says, \"coincidence or message, I'd say definitely, yes, that was a message from God.\" The subject is changed. \"So?\" says Nicky. \"How was everyone's week?\" Tony sits next to Alice. He is the most vociferous agnostic in the group. He always turns up in his business suit, straight from work, and has a hangdog expression, as if something is always troubling him. \"Tony?\" says Nicky. \"How was your week?\" \"I was talking to a homosexual friend,\" says Tony, \"and he said that ever since he was a child he found himself attracted to other boys. So why does the church think he's committing a sin? Are you going to Hell if you commit a sexual act that is completely normal to you? That seems a bit unfair, doesn't it?\" There is a murmur of agreement from the group. \"First of all,\" says Nicky, \"I have many wonderful homosexual friends. There's even an Alpha for gays running in Beverly Hills! Really! I think it's marvellous! But if a paedophile said, 'Ever since I was a child I found myself attracted to children', we wouldn't say that that was normal, would we?\" A small gasp. \"Now, I am not for a moment comparing homosexuals with paedophiles, but the Bible makes it very clear that sex outside marriage, including homosexual sex, is, unfortunately, a sin.\" He says he wishes it wasn't so, but the Bible makes it clear that gay people need to be healed. \"Although I strongly advise you not to say the word 'healed' to them,\" he quickly adds. \"They hate that word.\" The meeting is wound up. Nicky, Pippa and I stay around for a chat. We talk about who we feel might be on the cusp of converting. My money is on Alice. \"Really?\" says Nicky. \"You think Alice?\" \"Of course,\" I say. \"Who do you think?\" \"Tony,\" says Nicky. \"Tony?\" I say. \"We'll see,\" says Nicky. I drive home. In the middle of the night it becomes clear to me that I almost certainly had a message from God, that God had spoken to me through Nicky Gumbel. Woman leads church boycott in row over evangelical pig-snorting A woman has walked out of her church and is holding services in her living room because she says she cannot bring herself to 'snort like a pig and bark like a dog' on a Church of England course. Angie Golding, 50, claims she was denied confirmation unless she signed up for the Alpha course, which she says is a 'brainwashing' exercise where participants speak in tongues, make animal noises and then fall over. Mark Elsdon-Dew of HTB, Holy Trinity Brompton, said the Alpha course included lectures on the Holy Spirit. 'It affects different people in different ways,' he said. The Times, May 11, 1996 Of course, stumbling upon this press cutting comes as a shock. I had no idea that the shepherd's pie, the nice chats, that these things seem to be leading up to something so peculiar; something that will, I guess, occur during our weekend away in Kidderminster. I visit Mark Elsdon-Dew, Nicky's press man. I have grown fond of Mark. \"Do anything you want,\" he frequently tells me. \"Go home, if you like. Really. Any time you want. Don't worry, I won't phone you up! Ha ha!\" Mark was once the Daily Express's news editor, but then he did Alpha and now he works for Nicky, in a Portakabin on HTB's two-and-a-half acres. Nicky has so many staff - more, even, than the Archbishop of Canterbury, says Mark - that there aren't enough offices in this giant church to accommodate them all. I want to test Mark, to see how honest he will be about the negative press. I ask him if any journalist has written disapprovingly about Nicky. \"Oh yes,\" he says excitedly. \"Hang on, let me find them for you.\" Mark rifles through his filing cabinets and retrieves a sheath of articles. \"Look at this!\" he says. \"And how about this?\" One article, from the Spectator, suggests that Nicky's organisation is akin to the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, something that looks like the C of E, acts like the C of E, but is something else, something malignant, growing, poised to consume its host: \"For now they need the Church of England for its buildings - but they are very aware that through the wealth of their parishioners they wield an influence over the established Church that far outweighs their numbers.\" \"If you think that's bad,\" says Mark, \"you should see this one.\" Oh good, I think. It reads: \"HTB's divorce from the real world, together with a simplistic and communal response to all problems, a strong leader, and a money-conscious hierarchy, are trademarks of a cult.\" \"And here's a real stinker ,\" says Mark. The Alpha Course: Is It Bible-Based Or Hell-Inspired? This last one is from the Reverend Ian Paisley. His conclusion, after 15 pages of deliberation, is that it is Hell-Inspired. Usually, when a discovery such as this presents itself midway through researching a story, I feel nothing but glee. On this occasion, however, the gaiety is tinged with indignation and relief - indignation that these people, this apparent cult, has managed to get under my skin, to instil in me feelings of some kind of awakening, and relief because I no longer feel the need to deal with those feelings. It is Saturday morning, in the countryside near Kidderminster, and Nicky is offering us the strangest invitation. He is going to beckon us into the supernatural, where he hopes we will physically feel the Holy Spirit enter our bodies. Nicky tells me that he very much hopes people will speak in tongues. \"I'm so glad you could make it,\" he tells me. \"I'm glad to be here,\" I say, although I am thinking, \"Are you a cult leader?\" We've been arriving all night - in BMWs and Mercedes and Porsches - at the Pioneer Centre, a residential youth club booked for the weekend. The traffic was terrible. I was stuck in a jam behind a mini-van emblazoned with the words \"Jews For Jesus\", and toyed with the idea of taking this to be another message from God, but I chose to discount it. We are staying in dormitories - six to a room. Nicky and Pippa are not bunking up with the flock: Nicky says he needs space to concentrate. I don't think the agnostics quite grasp the reality of what will unfold in the next 36 hours. Many are completely unaware. Tongues!? How can Nicky make this happen? The next morning, we laze in the sun and then we are called into the chapel, a big pine hut. Tonight, England will play Germany. Nicky takes to the stage: \"Now, some of you may be thinking, 'Help! What's going to happen?' Well, first, I hope you have a wonderful time. Enjoy the weather, enjoy the sports, but, most of all, I hope we all experience the Holy Spirit.\" Nicky says that the Holy Spirit has often been ignored by the Church, because it sounds \"weird and supernaturally evil\". He says that the Church fears change, that he once said to an elderly vicar, \"You must have seen so many changes\", and that the vicar replied, \"Yes, and I have resisted every single one of them\". We laugh. Nicky says that this is a shame, because when people open themselves to the Holy Spirit you can see it in their faces. \"Their faces are alive!\" Look at Bach and Handel and da Vinci, he says. They had the Holy Spirit. Whatever line of work we're in - we could be bankers,\"or journalists\"- we can be filled to overflowing. Nicky says that it is absolutely amazing. \"All relationships involve emotions. I don't say to Pippa, 'I love you intellectually'. What I say is, 'I love you with my whole being, my mind, my heart, my will'. Ah, but that's in private. The British don't display emotions in public, do they?\" There is a silence. \"Just imagine,\" he says, \"that England will score a goal tonight. I think some people will go, 'Yeaah!'\" There is more laughter. The audience is relaxed. \"If a comedy film makes us laugh out loud in the cinema, the movie is considered a success. If a tragic play makes us weep in a theatre, the play is considered a success. But if a religious service makes us weep or laugh, we are accused of emotionalism!\" And so it goes on, with Nicky managing to make the most alarming prospect seem acceptable. Speaking in tongues would normally be something absurd, horrific even. But imperceptibly, gracefully, Nicky is leading us there. We have a few hours off. We swim and play basketball. The crowd is, as always, mainly white and wealthy. A criticism levelled at Nicky by other Anglicans is that Jesus cast his net wide to embrace poor fishermen, whereas Nicky seems to concentrate on rich widows, old Etonians and young high-fliers. This annoys him even more than the accusations that he is a cult leader. He points out a group of men on the edge of the basketball court. They lean against a picket fence, watching the game with an inscrutable vigilance, huge and tanned, like a prison gang during their hour in the yard. \"You absolutely must meet Brian,\" says Nicky. \"He's quite amazing.\" Brian is not his real name. \"I was a villain,\" says Brian. \"A professional criminal.\" \"Were you in a firm?\" I ask. \"I was the firm,\" he smiles. \"Say no more.\" From Brian's demeanour - he looks the archetypal English crime boss - I don't doubt this for a moment. It makes me smile: most vicars will proudly introduce you to some redeemed petty thief in their flock; once again Nicky attracts someone from the apex of his chosen profession. Back in the 80s, Brian was caught trying to pull off an enormous importation of cannabis. He was sentenced to 10 years in jail. In 1994, while in Exeter prison, Brian heard about Alpha. To curry favour with the chaplain, he called Nicky and asked him to visit the prison. Nicky sent a team instead. \"And within weeks,\" says Brian, \"all these hard men were waving our arms around like we were in a nightclub. Can you imagine it? People getting touched by the Holy Spirit, boys I knew who got banged up for some really naughty crimes ...\" That was the first time a prison had run an Alpha course. Brian was transferred to Dartmoor and took Alpha with him. Other converts did the same. That's how it spread through the prison system. Today, 120 of the 158 British prisons run Alpha courses; some have six-month waiting lists. Then there is this, from the March 2000 Alpha newsletter: US Governor George W Bush was so impressed by the impact of Alpha in the British prison system that he wants to start a trial programme at once in Texas. \"And all that started with Brian in 1994,\" says Nicky. \"It was such an amazing year.\" Indeed it was: on January 20, 1994, at a concrete church next to Toronto airport, 80% of the congregation, apropos of nothing, suddenly fell to the floor and began writhing around, apparently singing in tongues and convulsing violently. Rumours about this milestone - which became known as the Toronto Blessing - quickly spread to Britain. Nicky flew to Toronto to see it for himself. Was it mass hysteria or a miracle, a real experience of the Holy Spirit? \"I don't talk about it now,\" says Nicky. \"It divides people. It splits churches. It is very controversial. But I'll tell you - I think the Toronto Blessing was a wonderful, wonderful thing.\" Nicky returned from Canada, spoke passionately at HTB about the Toronto Blessing and, lo and behold, his congregation, too, began rolling on the floor, etc. The services soon became so popular, with queues around the block, that they were compelled to introduce two Sunday-evening sittings - and still not everyone could get in. HTB became Britain's richest church. (It still is: last year's income was \u00a35.1m.) This evangelical euphoria lasted the year, with miracles such as Prison Alpha cropping up all over the place. And then it ebbed away. But its influence has lasted. The Toronto Blessing was the kick-start Alpha needed. Alpha began at HTB in 1979, as a brush-up course for rusty churchgoers. Hardly anybody attended. It trundled along, causing no ripples, until Nicky arrived in 1991. Nicky is the son of agnostics. He discovered God while studying for the Bar at Cambridge, and gave up a career as a barrister to be ordained into the C of E in 1986. He saw Alpha's potential. What if he began targeting agnostics? What if he gave it an image make-over? \"Nicky bought standard lamps back in 1991,\" says Mark later that afternoon. \"He took an interest in the food. There are flowers. Young, quite-pretty girls welcome you at the door. Nicky identified some very important things. First, informality. Second, the course - people like the idea of going on a course, whether it's yoga or Christianity. Third, free and easy - we don't force anything down people's throats. People have a horror of being phoned up. And, finally, boredom - we will not bore you.\" Nicky's new direction combined with his charisma, his dazzlingly constructed weekly talks chipping away at our doubts, and the Toronto Blessing caused Alpha's popularity to explode through the 90s. In 1992, there were five Alpha courses in Britain, 100 rusty churchgoers attended that year. By 1994 there were 26,700 attendees. By the end of last year, there were 14,200 courses around the world, with 1.5 million attendees. Nicky has sold more than one million books. Alice had a wedding to go to, but hopes to arrive by this evening. The rest of our group gathers on the grass, and talk about our feelings about the Holy Spirit. \"I've got to say,\" says a woman called Annie, \"the idea of speaking in tongues really freaks me out.\" Nicky nods and smiles. \"I agree,\" says Jeremy, who works with asylum-seekers. \"I really don't want to be seen as some kind of freak.\" \"You won't suddenly become weirdos,\" explains James, one of the group leaders along with his wife, Julia, Nicky and Pippa. \"You won't lose your sense of humour, or your mates, or whether you drink beer or not.\" \"We shouldn't get too hung up on tongues,\" adds Julia. \"Tongues is just one of the many gifts. Tony? What do you think?\" Tony lights a cigarette. \"Do you have to believe in God before you receive the gift?\" he says \"Because it seems strange to ask some-one you don't believe in to prove that he exists.\" I wonder what makes Nicky think that Tony is our group's best candidate for conversion. \"The Church likes to put God in a box,\" says James. \"The Church wants to make God safe. We think the Church has lost the plot. We just want God to be God. As the Apostle Paul said, 'I would that you all speak in tongues.'\" We ask if they can speak in tongues, and they all say they can. James has been speaking in tongues for several years. Julia was fearful at first, but now does it a lot. Nicky and Pippa are extremely well-versed in tongues, which, they say, literally means \"languages never learnt\". They say that on countless occasions they have heard people who can't speak Chinese, for instance, speaking in Chinese tongues. Such miracles appear to be commonplace once one enters the arena of tongues - as we will do at around 6.30pm tonight. At 6pm, we are back in the chapel. Nicky is on stage, telling us nothing bad will happen to us. \"You don't need to speak in tongues. It is not the most important gift. But tongues is a beginner's gift, and Alpha is a beginner's course in Christianity, so it would be wonderful if you tried.\" We steel ourselves. The door opens. It is Alice. She has missed Nicky's comforting preamble and has arrived just in time for the main event. \"If you ask for the Holy Spirit, you're not going to get something terrible,\" says Nicky. \"Shall we give it a try? Shall we ask Him?\" \"Mmm,\" we say, contentedly. Nicky softly begins: \"Please stand up and close your eyes. If there's anyone who would like to experience the Holy Spirit, maybe you're not sure, I'd like you to say a very simple prayer in your heart ... a very simple prayer ... It's okay ... I now turn from everything that is wrong ... now hold out your hands ... hold them out in front of you ... if you'd like to ... some of you might be experiencing a weight on your hands ... you might be thinking nothing's happening ... but you might be feeling a peace ... a deep peace ... that, too, is a manifestation of the Holy Spirit ... Jesus is telling you He loves you ... He died for you.\" This is when the first sob comes - at the front, someone begins to cry. \"I sense that some of you would like to receive the gift of tongues now.\" I wobble on my feet. Later, James tells me that wobbling is a possible sign of the Holy Spirit. I open my eyes for a moment and look at the group. Tony is grinning, his eyes bulging, like a schoolboy in a pompous assembly. Alice, who is entirely unprepared, is looking perplexed and uncomfortable. I close my eyes. I imagine those who have been in this spell before me, Jonathan Aitken, for instance, and the business executives and celebrities. \"Start to praise God in any language but the language you speak ... Don't worry about your neighbour. Your neighbour will be worried enough about himself ... \" And then the tongues begin. I thought it would be cacophonous, but it turns out to be haunting, tuneful, like some experimental opera. I think some people are cheating - I hear French: \"C'est oui. C'est oui\" - but mostly it is quite beautiful. I open my eyes again and look around. Mark, Nicky's press officer, is speaking in tongues. So are James and Julia. All these people I have known all these weeks are speaking in tongues. Tony has refrained from tongues, but he is no longer grinning, either. He is crying. Alice looks ready to explode with anger. She barges out of the chapel. \"Be a little bolder now ...\" Nicky carries on. \"Just continue to receive this wonderful opportunity ...\" James walks over to me: \"Is it working for you?\" he asks. \"Well, it might have,\" I reply, truthfully, \"but the truth is, I'm a journalist, so I couldn't keep my eyes closed.\" \"Would you like me to pray for you?\" he asks. \"Okay,\" I say. James rests his hand on my shoulder. \"Oh Jesus, I pray that Jon will receive Your wonderful spirit. God. Please come and fill Jon with ... \" It is not working. The spell has broken. I tell James again that I'm sorry, but I'm a journalist. (This is no excuse - the picture editor of a Sunday newspaper is speaking in tongues to my left, as is a producer of Channel 4 documentaries in front of me, for the first time in his life.) So James changes tack. \"Oh thank you, Jesus, for Jon's wonderfully enquiring journalistic mind ... please help Jon's career ... no, not his career ... his wonderful journalism ... and may his journalism become even more wonderful now he is working in Your name, Jesus Christ ... \" I tell James I'm sorry, and follow Alice outside, where half-a-dozen furious agnostics have gathered on the grass. \"Why didn't anyone tell me I'd signed up for a brainwashing cult?\" says one. \"I felt like I was in a pack of hyenas. I wanted someone to come up and ask me if I was okay, and instead someone came up and said, 'Would you like me to pray for you?'\" Alice is devastated: \"I used to think Nicky was fantastic. He really gave me room to investigate my feelings about the Lord. But now I'm thinking, just get me away from these weirdos. I've been dragged all the way out here under false pretences, and there's no escape. I am actually very, very upset.\" We turn out to be in the minority, and watch as the new converts file out of the chapel, red-eyed from crying or smiling beatifically. Tony is one such convert, but he is not smiling. In fact, he seems miserable. \"Something overwhelmed me,\" he says. \"I didn't want it to. I tried to resist it, but I couldn't.\" \"What was it?\" I ask. \"The Holy Spirit,\" says Tony. \"What did it feel like?\" \"Like when you're trying not to cry but you can't help yourself. I was thinking of all the reasons why I didn't want it to happen - you know, the Christian lifestyle - and then Nicky came over to me and started whispering in my ear.\" \"What did he say?\" \"He said, 'I sense that you have had a Christian experience in the past'. And that rocked my world, because I have, and I didn't tell anyone. That's why I came on Alpha. I wanted to decide, once and for all, yes or no. And ...\" Tony sighs discontentedly. \"God spoke to me just now. He said, 'You can come back.' \" \u0095 Read part two of 'Catch me if you can' here.",

But the introduction of the rises - delayed by a high court defeat in July for the education secretary, David Blunkett - will proceed substantially as before after a report by a review body published yesterday.</p> <p>Most of the 197,000 teachers in England who have applied will be assessed between January and March and should receive the extra pay by Easter, although some may get it as soon as Christmas. The money will be backdated to September.</p> <p>The high court ruling in favour of the National Union of Teachers forced Mr Blunkett to go back to the school teachers review body (STRB), whose members are appointed by the prime minister. The NUT protested that the government had failed to consult on the scheme and opposed many of its conditions.

      "bodyText": "Teachers who have their applications for \u00a32,000 performance-related pay rises rejected will be entitled to appeal, the government conceded yesterday. But the introduction of the rises - delayed by a high court defeat in July for the education secretary, David Blunkett - will proceed substantially as before after a report by a review body published yesterday. Most of the 197,000 teachers in England who have applied will be assessed between January and March and should receive the extra pay by Easter, although some may get it as soon as Christmas. The money will be backdated to September. The high court ruling in favour of the National Union of Teachers forced Mr Blunkett to go back to the school teachers review body (STRB), whose members are appointed by the prime minister. The NUT protested that the government had failed to consult on the scheme and opposed many of its conditions. In the wake of the STRB report yesterday, both sides claimed victory and criticised each other. The pay rises will be awarded to classroom teachers without other management responsibilities at the top of their pay scale. The STRB accepted all the conditions teachers are required to satisfy to receive the award - including, controversially, showing that their pupils have made good academic progress. The STRB opposed calls to reopen the application deadline for the 50,000 eligible teachers in England who have not applied, although a few teachers who have moved to England from Wales, which has not yet set a deadline, will be allowed to apply. But Mr Blunkett accepted that the regulations should be changed to make it clearer that only senior staff with \"relevant line management responsibilities\" should be involved in assessing classroom teachers. The NUT had complained that under the current wording, the assessment system amounted to a \"snooper's charter\" that could require rank-and-file teachers to judge their peers. The education secretary also accepted the STRB's recommendation for a full review of the system in 2002. And he agreed to change procedure in relation to teachers who are turned down for the pay rise, either by the headteacher or by an external assessor brought in to oversee the head's decisions. Unsuccessful applicants will receive written feedback from the head and then be able to apply to another assessor for the decision to be overturned. The NUT accepted the review procedure and indicated it was now unlikely to support appeals through the courts. Mr Blunkett said he expected very few applications for review. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, attacked the change. He said: \"The judgment of the headteacher will be subject to change by both the external assessor and the appeal process. This adds another layer to what is already an incredibly bureaucratic process of putting teachers through a salary bar. It will add further to the massive additional workload which headteachers have faced in order to put this government scheme into practice.\" Teachers who pass the threshold will enter a new pay scale of up to \u00a330,000. Mr Blunkett said: \"It is our clear commitment to resume this process as quickly as possible so that teachers can get the pay rise they deserve.\" Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, blamed the NUT for delaying the pay award and said the system had \"not changed very much at all\". But Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said: \"The review body's report is a victory for the NUT. It justifies completely the union's decision to challenge the government's unlawful scheme in the high court. \"It's a pity that, for at least two years, pupil progress will be used since all the evidence proves how inappropriate they are as a measure of a teacher's performance.

      "trailText": "<p>Graham Joyce won  the British Fantasy Award four times. What is even more remarkable  is that he won it  with four very different books</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To win the British Fantasy Award four times is something of an achievement. It is even more of an achievement to win it with four very different books, all of which sit uneasily in the fantasy genre. \"Dark fantasy\" is perhaps the most useful way to describe the work of Graham Joyce, which belongs neither to horror (stories that make the flesh creep) or heroic fantasy (moral fictions involving dragons and big swords). Since his first novel, Dreamside, fantasy has simply offered him a way of writing the books he wanted to write. </p> <p>\"My story reflexes come less from fantasy or horror than from the darker sort of psychological thriller - not as plot-driven as most, rather more mood-driven,\" says Joyce. \"My interest in the supernatural is a complication - though I am less interested in ghosts than in people who see ghosts.\" </p> <p>His next book, Smoking Poppy, is set on the Burmese/Thai border among the animist Aka people. \"They see spirits not as necessarily what is left behind when you die, but as a sort of influence which emanates from you every moment that you are alive, and which may outlast you. It is a way of talking about people having enduring effects - just another language, no more irrational than the mystical strain that Jung put back into much psychology.\" </p> <p>The research for Smoking Poppy was done in Thailand, just as Dreamside came out of a year in Lesbos and Crete. For Joyce, the research always comes first. He was born in a mining village near Coventry, so it is perhaps unsurprising that he turns to mining for a metaphor to describe this creative process. \"I go down into the project to find the nature of the unknown mineral I sense is there,\" he says. The sorts of story he tells come out of the material he finds, which is why each of his books is so different. </p> <p> Indigo, for example, derived from conversations with artist friends. \"Art and science disagree on the number of basic colours in the spectrum: science lists six, but artists add indigo, even though they often refer to it as 'fugitive indigo'\" - the colour that can't be seen. As Joyce read around the subject, it occurred to him that to stand in a colour no one could see would be a sort of invisibility. This seed metaphor grew into other themes: the social invisibility of his hero Jack's much younger half-sister when they were children, the universal sense of loss when the past slips from memory. \"I got very interested, as a metaphor, in the exercises Aldous Huxley recommended: to see a thing properly, you do not stare at it, but cast your eyes up and down and around it.\" The metaphors of fantasy often provide a way of seeing clearly and precisely. </p> <p>He also uses precisely felt and visualised locations to actualise his metaphors. Requiem is set in Jerusalem, where the divisions (Christian, Jewish, Islamic) of a city that exudes religion from its stones gave Joyce an emotional correlative for the facturing of a human heart. When writing The Tooth Fairy, a novel set on his home turf, the industrial Midlands, the sight of a pond being filled gave him a metaphor for the rites of passage our unconscious inflicts on us. </p> <p> Indigo is in part built on the contrast between the two cities in which Jack searches for an understanding of the legacy left him by his magus father, Tim, whom he hardly knew. \"Rome is a place almost worn out by being looked at, a city collapsing under the weight of reference,\" Joyce says, while brash new Chicago remodels itself almost before your eyes. </p> <p>His characters are created from the responses he needs them to have to their situations; the journeys they must endure tell him who they are. In Indigo, \"I wanted to have two women who are opposed in the same way that the two cities in the book are. Jack's half-sister, Louise, is Chicago, where what you see is what you get, while Natalie, Tim's lover, is more like Rome, where there is a clash between surface and reality and you have to learn ways of seeing.\" The different ways in which Jack is drawn to the two women reflect both that contrast and what his research taught Joyce about incestuous desire. </p> <p>Tim's cult of followers reflects the saturnine and sardonic Joyce's own distrust of leaders. \"It was a lesson I learned back in the days of my involvement in NUS politics in the mid-1970s, and some of the people I learned it from are in power over us now.\" His first experience of student life was in Derby, where he trained as a teacher; later he went to Leicester University, where he did an MA in English and American literature and met his wife, Suzanne. They had thrown in their jobs and gone off to live in Lesbos for a year when his first publishing deal came through; by then he had been writing for 15 years. \"If I couldn't get published tomorrow I'd still be writing. It's something to do with feeling so overwhelmed by this experience of life that you have to tell someone about it, and in a way that reorders the experience to make it manageable,\" he says. </p> <p>But Joyce is also aware of the solitude of the writer's life: as he once put it, \"I have to get out once a week and speak with people or I start thinking I'm the emperor of Abyssinia.\" He now combines his own novels with teaching creative writing at Nottingham Trent University. One constant of his own disparate fiction is its reliance on the internal group dynamic of a few characters. \"When you're creating suspense, large groups have an inertia that means you have to stir more vigorously,\" he explains. \"A small group is a pure form; it responds easily when you turn the heat up or down.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501843092,00.html\">Buy Indigo at BOL</a></p>",

The Prime Minister has just made a statement to a jubilant House of Commons announcing the Argentine \"surrender\", and the word electrifies that slender and ambitious Conservative of 56 summers, Alan Clark. He is a man convinced that, though still mystifyingly without office of state, his robust backbench contributions have very materially contributed to Britain's greatest victory since 1945. This is what he writes: \"I rose rapidly, pushed my way through the crowd at the bar of the House and shot round through the 'Aye' Lobby to catch the Prime Minister as she emerged at the back of the Speaker's Chair to get to her room. No one else had the idea and I had a completely clear run . . . I rushed up and said to her: 'Prime Minister, only you could have done this; you did it alone, and your place in history is assured.' She looked a little startled. Had she heard properly?\" </p> <p>Oh, I think she had. And she was possibly startled at his appearance, which I like to think was that of a man transfigured in this euphoric moment into a 13-year-old Etonian, apple-cheeked, fleet of foot, high and light of voice, running as if along the rugger touchline to congratulate some older boy, on whom he has long nursed a crush, for a sporting triumph. Only Clark could have made the speech and written it up like this, at once proud of his extempore flourish, heedless of its sycophancy, awestruck at his own participation in history and twinklingly acknowledging a topnote of camp. Nothing in our post-May 1997 lexicon is quite like it: a man who takes his politics more seriously, and less seriously, than anyone else. </p> <p>Here is the second (posthumous) volume of the Clark Diaries, of whose impending publication I was first informed by the author himself, in a chilly telephone call three years ago to complain about the weekly Clark spoof-cum-hommage I was then writing for the London Evening Standard. \"This will damage the sales of the succeeding volume of my diaries, Peter,\" he said. It is a prequel: Clark from '72 to '82, running loosely from his selection to contest Plymouth Sutton to the Falklands, the entries being selected by Ion Trewin, Mrs Jane Clark having apparently allowed him unmediated access to the MS. All the signature tics are there: the cattiness, the wit, the lechery, the self-pity, the political landscape judged through the prism of his own ambition and amour propre. There are girls chatted up, and one vengeful mistress airily paid off with five grand. Understandably, perhaps, there is much less high politics than the first time around - Clark being further from the action - and more homely cares about health and money. Not Pooterish exactly, but more domestic. </p> <p>The Falklands moment quoted above is a rare example of Clark responding directly to a big event. On Thatcher's accession to the leadership in 1975 he is silent, and silent, too, for Harold Wilson's resignation in '76. But Trewin does not indicate where he is making omissions, so we can never be sure of these silences. For example, I turned eagerly to see what Clark would make of the Lord Lucan disappearance of 1974. Clark was a close friend of John Aspinall and Jimmy Goldsmith and a connoisseur of the class war - surely he would have something acute and indiscreet to say? Weirdly, not a word. Have the lawyers been breathing down Mr Trewin's neck? </p> <p>For so much of the time, the author exhibits an unaccustomed spectacle: Clark at bay. It is difficult to remember what it was like for the pre-Falklands Tory party when Thatcher's position was far from secure, and Clark is often seen running about like a headless chicken, unsure of who will be leader and where future patronage will lie. And then there is the seediness, dullness and nastiness of the 1970s political scene, best exemplified in Clark's tongue-out-of-cheek infatuation with the extreme right. You have to laugh when he tosses off asides like \"obsessed with the fall of the Reich\". Pertly, he praises the F\u00fchrer in a lunch with the Telegraph 's Frank Johnson, but elsewhere writes: \"Earlier, at my surgery, two real NF members had come in, for a chat. And I thought how good they were, and how brave is the minority . . .\" Just a pose still, perhaps, but how amusing? </p> <p>It would be a cliche for the pasticheur to claim that Clark is beyond parody, and then quote the riper bits in support of the thesis that you couldn't make it up. This is only partly true. These diaries are in some ways duller, more muted and less distinctive than the first volume; for another vintage year, maybe we must wait for a third tranche, covering Major to Blair. But there are stabs of something really arresting, namely Clark's passionate love for his children. In a passage from 1980, he muses on the \"last time\" for all life experiences, and how you never really know when it is the last time. He began by telling his sons a nightly bedtime story; then it became occasional; finally the boys were too sternly grown-up to allow it at all. Here we have love, sadness and mortality in one exquisitely judged vignette. Again, the Diaries have conferred on Clark what no prime minister, no chief whip have in their gift: political immortality.</p>",

In the same year that Younge's mother came to England from Barbados, they challenged the segregation laws by taking the bus from Washington to New Orleans - that, at least, was the plan - and not sitting in the seats that their race demanded they sit in.

Most salutary is the way he defends crucial aspects of American life, in the way that liberals over here tend not to (the line that goes \"race relations are much better here because blacks can date whites much more easily than in America\" is not really satisfactory). Had he grown up in America, his role models could have been \"anyone from Michael Jordan to Henry Louis Gates Jr ... whereas in Britain we had to pick between Frank Bruno, Lenny Henry and Trevor McDonald\".

As she travels the world, attempting to anatomise the enduring animosities and allegiances by which the peoples of Bosnia, South Africa, Northern Ireland and the Lebanon define and tear themselves apart, she circles a profoundly serious subject - the origins of our basic human hunger for hatred as well as for love. Yet the realities she is interested in, which engage her emotionally, defeat her stylistically. </p> <p>For all its admirable ambition, Friends and Enemies is fundamentally inarticulate. Faced with inconceivable brutality, Rowe never reaches beyond the elementary psychological language of her studies of domestic depression: there's a comic hubris in the scolding deadpan of her Mother Superior tone. Of the intricate family loyalties of the Hezbollah in Lebanon, she observes tartly: \"Many people stay close and loyal to their family. Their upbringing has not given them a broad perspective on society.\" When she's in Drumcree grappling with the mentality that sets Protestant against Catholic, and saying things like \"having an enemy who is immensely wicked is a great comfort because, no matter what you are, your enemy is worse\", it takes a quotation from Richard Hofstadter properly to shape her meaning: \"Anti-Catholicism has always been the pornography of the Puritan.\" </p> <p>Rowe carries her wisdom like a shield, and it armours her against any threatening complexity, any conceivability of error or qualification. Instead of asking questions that extend by emotional broadness the scope of our understanding, she gives answers that are banal not because they are completely wrong but because they aren't sufficiently right. The leitmotif of her book is the declaration: \"We were born just being. We looked around and found the world an interesting place. Then adult voices began instructing us. We took what these voices said inside us and lost the ability to just be. But it can be found again.\" </p> <p>Not if infancy is a process, a development, in which the child learns to play in order to reconcile itself to the potentially lonely world where it must learn to live, as it gradually separates itself from the sanctuary of its mother's love. And not if there is anything desirable in the goal of a mature adulthood, the acquisition of moral responsibility. Better, surely, to see the accepting stillness of the human mind as a striven-for equipoise rather than as the recovery of an alleged pre-adult, pre-neurotic calm, a happy, infantile passivity. What is lost in depression and in states such as schizophrenia isn't happiness or contentment but that resilience, that balance, that faith in our own self-correcting psychic integrity that the afflicted, to their great distress, find unattainable. </p> <p>One of the troubling things about Rowe's book is how intolerant her creed can sound. Is it enough to say to those in the grip of annihilating psychic agony, \"just be\", and then to blame them for \"wanting to stay in their prison\" if they fail to respond? When Jorge Luis Borges writes of \"the horror of being and going on being\", he touches the annihilating weariness of depression with a recognition of its stone-like intractability which is completely outside Rowe's structure of comprehension. The punitive fallacy of popular psychology, and of the whole self-help genre, is an ecological one - that if the soil is right, then the plant must grow straight. To suggest that happiness and satisfaction are not necessarily our spiritual birthright is heresy. </p> <p>Why do we hate? To keep the eternally fragile identity intact, as Rowe rightly sees. When we hate, our minds become simpler. But there's also a restlessness, a need to assert, in the dynamics of enmity, that lends it a paradoxical creativity. WH Auden understood this when, in The Sea and the Mirror, his meditation on Shakespeare's The Tempest, he had the benign magician Prospero's hard-won doctrine of reconciliation tauntingly rejected by an unrepentant and evil brother, Antonio, who refuses to cooperate with the prevailing spirit of holistic harmony: \"While I stand outside/ Your circle, the will to charm is still there.\" </p> <p>It was Auden's theme and it is Rowe's too: this creation around us of a magic circle of love, and our reluctance to abandon its protective power - to open ourselves to the world as it really is, not as our fantasies wish it to be. Yet, because he was a great poet, Auden captured in a stanza what Rowe cannot adequately describe, even in a long book: \"Our tears well from a love/ We have outgrown; our cities predict/ More than we hope; even our armies/ Have to express our need of forgiveness.\"</p>",

This new biography is the fascinating culmination of Sallis's longstanding admiration for \"a novelist in whom autobiography and fiction are inextricably and often maddeningly intertwined\", a genius who, 16 years after his death, still defies easy definition. Sallis is concerned to show how and where Himes's creative work connects with his life, rather than providing new revelations about a life sensational enough without extra embellishment. </p> <p>Himes was born in 1909 in Jefferson City, Missouri, across the street from the Lincoln Institute where his parents taught. His dark-skinned father could not live up to the aspirations of his light-bright-and-damn-near-white mother (who looked \"like a white woman who had suffered a long siege of illness\"), and the family constantly moved in search of better prospects, particularly after one brother was blinded in an explosion. At 16, while doing temporary work in a hotel, Chester fell 40ft down a lift shaft, shattering his teeth, breaking both arms and fracturing vertebrae. After months in hospital, he went on to attend Ohio State University. Then, against the background of bitter, violent parental quarrels, Chester began a spree of delinquency. Brothels, bars, gambling, rakish clothes and tough-guy postures became his style. He was headed straight for jail. In 1929, aged 19, he was sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary for armed robbery. By the time of his release, at the age of 26, he had become a writer, with stories appearing in Esquire and other prestigious outlets. </p> <p>His first novel, If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945), was fuelled by all the anger, fear and violence of the American racial war, as was The Lonely Crusade (1947). A novel of prison life, Cast the First Stone, appeared in 1952, so cut by its publishers as to be unrecognisable. The US was not doing right by Himes. His early marriage (to \"the most beautiful brownskin girl I had ever seen\") was over. He lost himself in sex (with white women) and drunkenness. In April 1953, he left for Paris. </p> <p>In Europe he began a new phase: new relationships, a new genre of work. A brief return to New York a couple of years later in pursuit of another doomed interracial affair proved a mistake, but provided indelible impressions to be mined later. Visiting Harlem with writer George Lamming (Barbadian, rather than Jamaican as asserted), Himes discovered \"that I still liked black people and felt exceptionally good among them, warm and happy. I dug the brothers' gallows humor and was turned on by the black chicks. I felt at home and I could have stayed there for ever if I didn't have to go out into the white world to earn my living\". </p> <p>The books with which he was about to earn that living were nine novels known as the Harlem cycle, at once funny and violent, featuring ace black detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones. In a 1970 interview Himes would claim that a major motivation was to force white Americans to confront the horror and brutalisation of the black ghettos - a reprise of the epigraph to Blind Man With a Pistol (1969): \"'Blink once, you're robbed,' Coffin Ed advised the white man slumming in Harlem. 'Blink twice, you're dead,' Grave Digger added dryly.\" Yet Himes also claimed: \"The Harlem of my books was never meant to be real; I never called it real; I just wanted to take it away from the white man, if only in my books.\" </p> <p>Sallis is not intimidated. His triumph lies in a complete mastery of the Himes oeuvre, enabling him to perform intertextual surgery on a body of work comprising a score of novels, some 60 short stories and a two-volume autobiography. The details of Himes's life, it emerges, are often multiple-choice. \"The biographer, sorting his notecards, attributing motive and design in retrospect, proceeds at peril.\" Wary of \"facts\", Sallis is assured on texts, sussing out Himes's mix-and-match techniques, outing the fictive and autobiographical avatars, the facsimiles, alter egos and surrogates. But paralleling the twists and turns of Himes's literary career are the contortions of his private life, the affairs that spanned melodrama and incongruity (including a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-type trip to Westphalia to visit the bemused parents of a German girlfriend). </p> <p>\"Realism and absurdity are so similar in the lives of American blacks one cannot tell the difference,\" Himes wrote in the second volume of his autobiography, My Life of Absurdity. (His widow Lesley has spoken of her role as editor as well as typist: \"I'd take the manuscript back and say, 'Chester, this wasn't like that...') Or as Ishmael Reed put it: \"So this is what we want: to sabotage history. They won't know whether we're serious or whether we are writing fiction ... Always keep them guessing.\" </p> <p>Hindsight can make one disingenuous. Sallis writes: \"One forever wonders what might have happened had Himes's books been published with proper timeliness, The Third Generation, for instance, a decade later, in the midst of the civil rights movement. Or The Primitive not in oblivious 1956 but in, say, 1986, when an audience, one responding to work by such as Maya Angelou, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, existed.\" Surely the civil-rights and women's movements affected the choices of publishers: an audience can only respond to what is presented to them, and how. </p> <p>Sallis's close textual approach makes the critical paraphernalia seem wanting. There is no chronology. Notes refer to publications not in the bibliography.

      "bodyText": "Chester Himes: A Life James Sallis 370pp, Payback Press \u00a318.99 Buy it at BOL If Chester Himes hadn't existed, James Sallis might have had to invent him. This new biography is the fascinating culmination of Sallis's longstanding admiration for \"a novelist in whom autobiography and fiction are inextricably and often maddeningly intertwined\", a genius who, 16 years after his death, still defies easy definition. Sallis is concerned to show how and where Himes's creative work connects with his life, rather than providing new revelations about a life sensational enough without extra embellishment. Himes was born in 1909 in Jefferson City, Missouri, across the street from the Lincoln Institute where his parents taught. His dark-skinned father could not live up to the aspirations of his light-bright-and-damn-near-white mother (who looked \"like a white woman who had suffered a long siege of illness\"), and the family constantly moved in search of better prospects, particularly after one brother was blinded in an explosion. At 16, while doing temporary work in a hotel, Chester fell 40ft down a lift shaft, shattering his teeth, breaking both arms and fracturing vertebrae. After months in hospital, he went on to attend Ohio State University. Then, against the background of bitter, violent parental quarrels, Chester began a spree of delinquency. Brothels, bars, gambling, rakish clothes and tough-guy postures became his style. He was headed straight for jail. In 1929, aged 19, he was sent to the Ohio State Penitentiary for armed robbery. By the time of his release, at the age of 26, he had become a writer, with stories appearing in Esquire and other prestigious outlets. His first novel, If He Hollers Let Him Go (1945), was fuelled by all the anger, fear and violence of the American racial war, as was The Lonely Crusade (1947). A novel of prison life, Cast the First Stone, appeared in 1952, so cut by its publishers as to be unrecognisable. The US was not doing right by Himes. His early marriage (to \"the most beautiful brownskin girl I had ever seen\") was over. He lost himself in sex (with white women) and drunkenness. In April 1953, he left for Paris. In Europe he began a new phase: new relationships, a new genre of work. A brief return to New York a couple of years later in pursuit of another doomed interracial affair proved a mistake, but provided indelible impressions to be mined later. Visiting Harlem with writer George Lamming (Barbadian, rather than Jamaican as asserted), Himes discovered \"that I still liked black people and felt exceptionally good among them, warm and happy. I dug the brothers' gallows humor and was turned on by the black chicks. I felt at home and I could have stayed there for ever if I didn't have to go out into the white world to earn my living\". The books with which he was about to earn that living were nine novels known as the Harlem cycle, at once funny and violent, featuring ace black detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones. In a 1970 interview Himes would claim that a major motivation was to force white Americans to confront the horror and brutalisation of the black ghettos - a reprise of the epigraph to Blind Man With a Pistol (1969): \"'Blink once, you're robbed,' Coffin Ed advised the white man slumming in Harlem. 'Blink twice, you're dead,' Grave Digger added dryly.\" Yet Himes also claimed: \"The Harlem of my books was never meant to be real; I never called it real; I just wanted to take it away from the white man, if only in my books.\" Sallis is not intimidated. His triumph lies in a complete mastery of the Himes oeuvre, enabling him to perform intertextual surgery on a body of work comprising a score of novels, some 60 short stories and a two-volume autobiography. The details of Himes's life, it emerges, are often multiple-choice. \"The biographer, sorting his notecards, attributing motive and design in retrospect, proceeds at peril.\" Wary of \"facts\", Sallis is assured on texts, sussing out Himes's mix-and-match techniques, outing the fictive and autobiographical avatars, the facsimiles, alter egos and surrogates. But paralleling the twists and turns of Himes's literary career are the contortions of his private life, the affairs that spanned melodrama and incongruity (including a Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-type trip to Westphalia to visit the bemused parents of a German girlfriend). \"Realism and absurdity are so similar in the lives of American blacks one cannot tell the difference,\" Himes wrote in the second volume of his autobiography, My Life of Absurdity. (His widow Lesley has spoken of her role as editor as well as typist: \"I'd take the manuscript back and say, 'Chester, this wasn't like that...') Or as Ishmael Reed put it: \"So this is what we want: to sabotage history. They won't know whether we're serious or whether we are writing fiction ... Always keep them guessing.\" Hindsight can make one disingenuous. Sallis writes: \"One forever wonders what might have happened had Himes's books been published with proper timeliness, The Third Generation, for instance, a decade later, in the midst of the civil rights movement. Or The Primitive not in oblivious 1956 but in, say, 1986, when an audience, one responding to work by such as Maya Angelou, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, existed.\" Surely the civil-rights and women's movements affected the choices of publishers: an audience can only respond to what is presented to them, and how. Sallis's close textual approach makes the critical paraphernalia seem wanting. There is no chronology. Notes refer to publications not in the bibliography.

The depths of the ex-Smiths singer's mailbag would be a thing of wonder if they were half as hilarious or harrowing as Russell's belated debut as a novelist. Educating Rita was the play that explained how Russell, himself a ladies' hairdresser, came to redirect his destiny in order to write; The Wrong Boy is essentially a novel about writing itself. </p> <p>Raymond, like Russell, is a boy who needs to write: not through any high-minded idea of authorship, but as a means of clinging on to his precarious sanity. The dispatches to Morrissey remain unsent, interspersed with poems and songs in the journal he has compiled since the unfortunate fallout from the fly-trapping incident at the canal. </p> <p>It was the fly you had to feel sorry for. There it was, buzzing along the Rochdale canal, before coming to rest on the exposed glans of some smutty teenage truant; and without any time to assess the situation - whap! - the poor thing gets asphyxiated by foreskin. It's the end of that particular fly's problems, but only the beginning of Raymond's. \"We weren't wanking!\" he protests. \"None of us were. I know we had our things out, all 15 of us - but it doesn't necessarily mean we were wanking.\" </p> <p>Onanistic or not, Raymond's patented pest-control method cuts little ice with his headmaster, who has him summarily expelled on a charge of group masturbation, bestiality and being out of bounds during the lunch hour. The scandal transforms an ordinary boy into a pariah. Shunned by friends, politely requested to leave the Scouts, Raymond retreats to his bedroom, where he is perfectly happy being miserable until Uncle Bastard Jason fixes him up with a job on a Grimsby building site and issues stern instructions to sort himself out. </p> <p>The novel is principally a cod-picaresque odyssey to the cod basket of the north, with Raymond's hapless hitchhiking bringing him into contact with all manner of short-tempered transport officials, psychopathic truck drivers and a vanful of Dewsbury desperadoes en route to a country-music convention. The dialogue - as you might expect from a dramatist - is cracking stuff: a colloquial poetry reminiscent of Roddy Doyle. </p> <p>Like Doyle, Russell is capable of pushing light fiction into some disturbingly dark corners. Though the laughs never flag for long, Ray's case history has him dredge up incidents from the deepest recesses of real misery: a litany of adult miscomprehension leading to special schools, suspected sexual abuse, suicide attempts and wasted swathes of time spent as a drug zombie on day wards. Throughout, the inarticulate adolescent lacks the resources to fend for himself, but maintains the miraculous ability to express himself privately though the written word. </p> <p>Ray, in other words, is a misunderstood talent waiting to be discovered: and while the ending may seem too sentimental for some, Russell's novel remains an alarmingly personal tract expressed in unpretentious language, which heavyweight critics, in the words of his own educated Rita, \"probably won't like, because you can understand it\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Wrong Boy Willy Russell 411pp, Doubleday \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL You may be surprised to find the epistolary novel making a comeback at the hands of Willy Russell, but just as Richardson's Clarissa confides in her cousin, Russell's adolescent hero, Raymond Marks, relates his story entirely in missives to Morrissey. The depths of the ex-Smiths singer's mailbag would be a thing of wonder if they were half as hilarious or harrowing as Russell's belated debut as a novelist. Educating Rita was the play that explained how Russell, himself a ladies' hairdresser, came to redirect his destiny in order to write; The Wrong Boy is essentially a novel about writing itself. Raymond, like Russell, is a boy who needs to write: not through any high-minded idea of authorship, but as a means of clinging on to his precarious sanity. The dispatches to Morrissey remain unsent, interspersed with poems and songs in the journal he has compiled since the unfortunate fallout from the fly-trapping incident at the canal. It was the fly you had to feel sorry for. There it was, buzzing along the Rochdale canal, before coming to rest on the exposed glans of some smutty teenage truant; and without any time to assess the situation - whap! - the poor thing gets asphyxiated by foreskin. It's the end of that particular fly's problems, but only the beginning of Raymond's. \"We weren't wanking!\" he protests. \"None of us were. I know we had our things out, all 15 of us - but it doesn't necessarily mean we were wanking.\" Onanistic or not, Raymond's patented pest-control method cuts little ice with his headmaster, who has him summarily expelled on a charge of group masturbation, bestiality and being out of bounds during the lunch hour. The scandal transforms an ordinary boy into a pariah. Shunned by friends, politely requested to leave the Scouts, Raymond retreats to his bedroom, where he is perfectly happy being miserable until Uncle Bastard Jason fixes him up with a job on a Grimsby building site and issues stern instructions to sort himself out. The novel is principally a cod-picaresque odyssey to the cod basket of the north, with Raymond's hapless hitchhiking bringing him into contact with all manner of short-tempered transport officials, psychopathic truck drivers and a vanful of Dewsbury desperadoes en route to a country-music convention. The dialogue - as you might expect from a dramatist - is cracking stuff: a colloquial poetry reminiscent of Roddy Doyle. Like Doyle, Russell is capable of pushing light fiction into some disturbingly dark corners. Though the laughs never flag for long, Ray's case history has him dredge up incidents from the deepest recesses of real misery: a litany of adult miscomprehension leading to special schools, suspected sexual abuse, suicide attempts and wasted swathes of time spent as a drug zombie on day wards. Throughout, the inarticulate adolescent lacks the resources to fend for himself, but maintains the miraculous ability to express himself privately though the written word. Ray, in other words, is a misunderstood talent waiting to be discovered: and while the ending may seem too sentimental for some, Russell's novel remains an alarmingly personal tract expressed in unpretentious language, which heavyweight critics, in the words of his own educated Rita, \"probably won't like, because you can understand it\".",

But he is no help to his patient, whose irredeemable, hysterical misery he takes for everyday unhappiness. Perlman's therapist is so unorthodox that it is almost a surprise when we finally face the familiar clinical undergrowth: mother. One moment loving, the next withholding; \"she just wasn't there\". But at least he is gallant enough to see her impossible role, a cross between deity and slave. Many of the other therapists we encounter, especially when made known to us by clients of a certain age and sexuality, fail their patients with more consistent orthodoxy: their narrow-minded prejudices. </p> <p>The first to represent the suffering sane is Edmund White, in prose as pleasingly elegant as that of Perlman. He is less angry than he might be with the health professionals he would have done well to elude.

White seems always to have known the clinical coda - absent father/ suffocating mother. It was 1950s Freudians, and so many in their wake, who appear not to have known that the pleasures this particular patient found acting out his perverse fantasies were hardly the symptoms of dangerous pathology. But time heals even the scars left by damaging healers - if you're lucky. </p> <p>White's renewal came with the clarion call of gay liberation, after which, as he sees it, \"Freudian psychology went up in flames\" - along with the culture of shame that had produced it. I'm not so sure. He is right about the conflagration Freud has provoked, but wrong to believe we face only its expired ashes, dormant in cold fireplaces \"the morning after\". Analytic embers are still burning bright, for all the boosted belief in medical solutions for our psychological afflictions. </p> <p>When especially miserable, White himself still cruises in search of that talented clinician, the right man for the job. Nowadays he believes the healer's skills stem not from any theoretical system but from an unusually gifted sensitivity attuned to \"signals pitched above the ordinary range of human hearing\". There is certainly evidence to support his conviction, echoed here in a moving essay by Justine Picardie, finally finding relief from the anguish of her sister's early death in the presence of one often seen as definitively charlatan: a spirit medium. As she knows, lost ones do return to us, in our dreams and in the beat of our hearts. </p> <p>We leave the uncertain world of the clinic for the certainties, discipline and methodological mania of the laboratory in Ian Parker's impressively researched description of Stanley Milgram's classic studies of \"obedience\" in the 1960s. True to his training as a social psychologist, he had little theory. But he certainly knew how to measure, though what he was measuring is anybody's guess. Although Milgram and others fantasised that he was recording responses to a set of variables analogous to those resulting in the mass slaughter of Jews by Hitler, it seems less plausible that his subjects believed Yale University would be condoning the torture until death of slow-learning Irish Americans. With genuine respect for a man trapped within the conventions of his discipline, Parker suggests that he was producing a type of performance art. If so, it has proved the most boringly repetitious art-form ever encountered: for all the criticisms since made of Milgram's work, I can testify that experiments copying the same formula and drawing equally fatuous conclusions are followed to this day. </p> <p>It would be easy to exaggerate the pleasures of this issue of Granta . There is the usual presence of essays that seem like exercises from creative-writing classes. But the conclusion, Roy Hattersley's mourning of the burial of social democracy, or any commitment to producing greater equality in the ideological vacuum of the third way, sounds the right endnote for me. The increasing levels of personal misery, whether experienced by the overworked, the jobless or the house-bound, are not altogether separable from this particular ideological landscape. </p> <p>There is no political solution to the suffering in Tim Parks's poignant description of his brother-in-law's schizophrenia; Paolo's paranoid hallucinations make him, at least so far, one of the incurably mentally ill. The erratic and smothering love displayed by Paolo's mammina may indeed have something to do with her son's tragic fate. But most of us are also suffering from the contradictions and cruelties of the recently intensified competition in capitalist markets, with the soaring individualism, sense of self-defeat and shorter-term triumphs that engenders. Those of us who think we need help are often already too knowing for what is on offer. Those most gravely in need of help are often much too threatened by the knowledge they might receive - and too poor to pay for it anyway. Meanwhile, am I really the only Jewish daughter on earth to have suffered from a capricious, all-too-present, over-excitable father and an absent mother? Some of us just won't fit into the narratives, wherever we seek them out.</p>",

If so, it has proved the most boringly repetitious art-form ever encountered: for all the criticisms since made of Milgram's work, I can testify that experiments copying the same formula and drawing equally fatuous conclusions are followed to this day. It would be easy to exaggerate the pleasures of this issue of Granta . There is the usual presence of essays that seem like exercises from creative-writing classes. But the conclusion, Roy Hattersley's mourning of the burial of social democracy, or any commitment to producing greater equality in the ideological vacuum of the third way, sounds the right endnote for me. The increasing levels of personal misery, whether experienced by the overworked, the jobless or the house-bound, are not altogether separable from this particular ideological landscape. There is no political solution to the suffering in Tim Parks's poignant description of his brother-in-law's schizophrenia; Paolo's paranoid hallucinations make him, at least so far, one of the incurably mentally ill. The erratic and smothering love displayed by Paolo's mammina may indeed have something to do with her son's tragic fate. But most of us are also suffering from the contradictions and cruelties of the recently intensified competition in capitalist markets, with the soaring individualism, sense of self-defeat and shorter-term triumphs that engenders. Those of us who think we need help are often already too knowing for what is on offer. Those most gravely in need of help are often much too threatened by the knowledge they might receive - and too poor to pay for it anyway. Meanwhile, am I really the only Jewish daughter on earth to have suffered from a capricious, all-too-present, over-excitable father and an absent mother? Some of us just won't fit into the narratives, wherever we seek them out.",
