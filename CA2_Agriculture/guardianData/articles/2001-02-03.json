The former needs no guide - the rainbow paint, cobbled piazzas and photogenic bridges ooze instant charm. In Torcello, we needed enlightenment about the part this ghost island played in the history of the region - why its population, once 20,000, has shrank to 60; why its basilica, founded in 639, is the oldest building in the lagoon. Ship's guides kept us well briefed, in three languages. </p> <p>Next morning, the ship followed the long thin streak of the barrier islands, Lido and Pellestrina, and crossed to the busy fishing port of Chioggia.

Not only were the piazzas deserted, the shops shuttered, the famous fruit and vegetable market closed, but Giotto's illustrious 39 frescoes in the Capelli di Scrovegni, one of the high spots of the cruise, were not on view.

Be advised, though, it is necessary to make a reservation in order to see them. </p> <p>Mantua deserves more than a few hours to explore the town's treasures and the 16th-century Palazzo del Te, an imposing country house on the outskirts.

Here is a taste of his description of being in Wanaka:</strong> </p> <p>\"That evening I treated myself to a trip to the pictures. The movie was a laughably bad... but the film didn't really matter because Wanaka cinema was such a delight. About the size of a village hall, the seating was a motley assortment of armchairs and sofas with a convertible Morris Minor thrown in for good measure. Half way through, the film stopped and everyone went outside to the adjoining caf\u00e9 and got freshly-baked cookies (still warm), home-made ice cream or a beer and then settled back into their armchairs. This is how all cinemas should be.\" </p> <p>Then he went to Queenstown and was persuaded to go for a bunjee jump: \"You are supposed to perform an elegant swan dive, but standing there on the edge I lost my nerve and basically fell off. I had a brief sensation of hanging in the air. I felt like I was in one of those cartoons where the animated character has run off the cliff and his legs are whirring over nothing. Then I was plummeting down towards the river. Then I was bouncing back up to the bridge. Then I was falling back down again.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/movies/travel/video.mpg\" target=\"_NEW\">Watch video of Sam's jump</a></p> <p>Later, the 28-year-old civil servant, went on a two-day kayaking trip in Doubtful Sound, in Fiordland National Park, at the bottom of New Zealand's west coast, and encountered some dolphins: \"As they got closer to us, the pod dived. For a moment everything was still. And the next moment the dolphins were playing all around us. They jumped over each other. They raced us. They dived under the kayaks. They swam alongside us. Two leapt out of the water either side of me. It must have only lasted a few short minutes but what an incredible emotional experience. I will never forget it.\" </p> <p><strong>Meanwhile Sue, a 51-year-old divorcee, is in Sarawak, Malaysia:</strong></p> <p>\"Mulu park has the largest limestone cave system in the world. There are four show caves. On Wednesday, I set off for the Deer and Lang caves. With what appears to be becoming my usual timing, I picked the day the generator broke down so the caves were not lit.

      "bodyText": "Sam, one of our trio of netjetters who is keeping in touch with thousands of Guardian Unlimited users at www.theguardian.com/netjetters on their trips around the world, has been having a fantastic time in New Zealand. Here is a taste of his description of being in Wanaka: \"That evening I treated myself to a trip to the pictures. The movie was a laughably bad... but the film didn't really matter because Wanaka cinema was such a delight. About the size of a village hall, the seating was a motley assortment of armchairs and sofas with a convertible Morris Minor thrown in for good measure. Half way through, the film stopped and everyone went outside to the adjoining caf\u00e9 and got freshly-baked cookies (still warm), home-made ice cream or a beer and then settled back into their armchairs. This is how all cinemas should be.\" Then he went to Queenstown and was persuaded to go for a bunjee jump: \"You are supposed to perform an elegant swan dive, but standing there on the edge I lost my nerve and basically fell off. I had a brief sensation of hanging in the air. I felt like I was in one of those cartoons where the animated character has run off the cliff and his legs are whirring over nothing. Then I was plummeting down towards the river. Then I was bouncing back up to the bridge. Then I was falling back down again.\" Watch video of Sam's jump Later, the 28-year-old civil servant, went on a two-day kayaking trip in Doubtful Sound, in Fiordland National Park, at the bottom of New Zealand's west coast, and encountered some dolphins: \"As they got closer to us, the pod dived. For a moment everything was still. And the next moment the dolphins were playing all around us. They jumped over each other. They raced us. They dived under the kayaks. They swam alongside us. Two leapt out of the water either side of me. It must have only lasted a few short minutes but what an incredible emotional experience. I will never forget it.\" Meanwhile Sue, a 51-year-old divorcee, is in Sarawak, Malaysia: \"Mulu park has the largest limestone cave system in the world. There are four show caves. On Wednesday, I set off for the Deer and Lang caves. With what appears to be becoming my usual timing, I picked the day the generator broke down so the caves were not lit. Deer cave is huge, home to millions of bats. The towering walls and rock formations are all covered with a layer of guano. \"You had to be careful not to gape too much at the magnitude of the cave as the smell of ammonia was very powerful, or to not slip on the fine layer of droppings on the walkway...\" To read their full accounts, and catch up with gap-year student Millie in Australia, visit www.theguardian.com/netjetters.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>George Bush may be a typical Texan, but he was never a typical Austinite. In the popular image, Texans wear 10-gallon hats, drive pick-up trucks, and are only too happy to point out the exact location of the Mason-Dixon line. Their women are shoulder-padded, lip-glossed Sue Ellen clones for whom 80s power dressing never really went away. Austin is different, a diverse community of artists, musicians, low-budget guerrilla film makers, writers and twentysomething bohos. The state capital stands out like a vegetarian at a Texan barbecue. </p> <p>Its attitude towards its old governor was best expressed in the post-election issue of the popular newsweekly, the Austin Chronicle. The front page was just a blank sheet of funereal black, the header picked out in a sombre grey. </p> <p>Austin is full of people who will tell you they came for a week and decided to stay for good. The city has a young feel, in part due to the colossal University of Texas, the only campus in the world that has its own oil drill, and also because of its reputation as a low-rent slacker's paradise where the many caf\u00e9s, bars, bookshops and clubs have elevated hanging out to an art form. </p> <p>Local indie film director, Richard Linklater shot Dazed and Confused here, and committed Austin's own brand of laid-back cool to celluloid in his 1991 film Slacker, a cinema-verit\u00e9 style portrayal of Austin's deadbeat anti-yuppie subculture. </p> <p>People don't come to here to spend time sightseeing and ticking off a list of must-sees, which are a little thin on the ground anyway. A quick run around the downtown area takes care of the more conventional tourist sights including the rosy granite Texas State Capitol which, in a typically Texan touch, stands 7ft taller than the one in Washington. The nearby Greek-revival governor's mansion is only a must for Dubya fans who hanker after the vicarious thrill of sitting at his old desk. On East 5th Street, the O Henry Museum celebrates the 19th-century short-story writer. </p> <p>But music is what really matters in Austin. The city claims to be the Live Music Capital of the World, a moniker which is included on every piece of official city letterhead. In a town where local heroes such as Willie Nelson and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan are gods, Austin music never entirely forgets its Texan roots, but the hybrid of country twang, blues licks, folk and the odd psychedelic flourish has spawned unique musical mutations such as cowpunk and an alt-country cowboy style that is more cosmic than rhinestone. </p> <p><strong> Best venues</strong><br> </p> <p>Antone's on 5th Street is a cornerstone of Austin's music heritage. Owner Clifford Antone has been hosting blues legends such as Muddy Waters and Fats Domino since 1973. With the Continental Club on South Congress, this is the place to catch homegrown musicians such as Joe Ely, Jimmie Vaughan, Alejandro Escovedo and Toni Price. </p> <p>At night, the downtown area can seem like one long pub crawl with more than 50 clubs and music venues (more per capita than LA or New York) all clustered around 6th Street. </p> <p>The 6th Street area is also home to Leslie, a much-loved local transvestite, as much a part of Austin as the Capitol itself. Treated by many as an unofficial city mascot, Leslie sashays down Congress Avenue often dressed in little more than a bra and thong and has even run for mayor. Many think he would make a better president than Dubya. </p> <p>Cooler Austinites are to be found reclining on threadbare sofas in Lovejoys on Neches Street, sipping dirty martinis at Club Deville or experiencing live aural mayhem at Emo's or Stubbs on Red River Street. </p> <p>The Warehouse District around 4th Street has witnessed a rash of cigar-and-martini bars to cater largely for out-of-towners who have relocated in droves to work in Austin's burgeoning hi-tech industry. The yuppified velvet-rope cocktail lounges and faux-Irish bars seem out of place in a town where not wearing shorts counts as formal dress. </p> <p>Ruta Maya on 4th Street is a more typical Austin hangout. Photographs and paintings of the Zapatistas hang on the well-worn walls, and your cup of joe comes with a conscience, the coffee beans bought from cooperative farmers in the Mexican highlands of Chiapas. You can sample some hand-rolled Cuban Cohibas in the adjoining smokeshop or listen to live reggae bands while sipping a Ruta Maya beer imported from El Salvador. </p> <p>But in case you think that Austin is all about lo-fi boho chic and bands such as local post-punk industrial darlings The Butthole Surfers, a visit to the Broken Spoke on South Lamar Boulevard should remind you that you are still in the state of Texas. While not quite the Grand 'Ole Opry, this is the place to listen to real \"howdy partner\" Texan country music and queue for ice-cold beer with cowboy-booted, vowel-strangling good ol' boys, known in Austin parlance as \"Bubbas\". </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p>If LA is the home of the resting actor who waits tables between auditions, and Miami is where wannabe models take food orders with a surly smile, Austin is the city where your plate of artery-clogging Tex Mex will more than likely be served up by a jobbing musicians who may slip you a demo tape with the side order of tortillas. The vast range of restaurants, caf\u00e9s and mom 'n' pop diners means that Austin's musician/waiter population can always depend on waiting tables to make the rent. </p> <p>A popular breakfast stop is Las Manitas on Congress Avenue with its renowned migas, a mix of eggs scrambled with tortilla chips, onions, monterey jack, cilantro and the obligatory chillis. </p> <p>Jovitas and El Mercado, both on South 1st Street, serve up Tex Mex enchiladas, burritos, tacos and guacamole in belt-straining portions best washed down with locally-brewed Celis beer or a glass of chilled horchata, a milky drink made from tiger nuts. </p> <p>Austinites take their preferences for the local mesquite-smoked barbeque seriously. Everybody has a favourite barbeque joint, with Stubbs, Ruby's and the Saltlick cropping up on most lists. </p> <p>Stubbs Bar-B-Q on Red River Street is famous for its sauce, which is sold all over the States. If you want to do your constitution serious damage, try an all-American, additive-packed tooth destroying dessert of Twinkies - a really sweet spongecake with an even-sweeter filling. Ruby's on West 29th Street is an after-hours meeting place for musicians, students and clubbers who come for the smoked ribs and hormone-free beef. Die-hard barbecue fans make the 20-mile journey out of town to the Saltlick, which can seat up to 800 hungry carnivores outside. </p> <p>Threadgills restaurant, a former 1930s gas station, is serves downhome Southern cooking, but its fame rests on the fact that it was here that Janis Joplin started off as just a smalltown Texan girl with a guitar. One of the specials is the ubiquitous Texan chicken-fried steak - ground beef fried in a thick batter coating and served with creamy gravy, biscuits and greens. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p>The grand old dame of Austin hotels has to be The Driskill on the corner of 6th Street. Built in 1886 by cattle baron Jesse Driskill, the elegant lobby has played host to stars of Hollywood's golden age, stringy-haired musicians, Texan oil barons and politicians - local boy made good Lyndon Johnson had a suite here. </p> <p>The unintentionally phallic neon sign for the Austin Motel on South Congress is an Austin landmark and one of the longest-running local jokes. No two rooms are alike, with some featuring murals of the Great Wall of China, Mount Fuji and Dutch tulip fields, which some people think are just on the tasteful side of kitsch. </p> <p>Further along South Congress is the San Jose motel. Blending hacienda-style architecture with zen-like minimalism, it is a haven of calm and tranquility on this busy stretch of vintage clothing stores, caf\u00e9s, gun shops and boutiques that leads right into the downtown area. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>British Airways (0845 7733377) flies Heathrow to Dallas with American Airways connection to Austin from \u00a3376.69 return inc tax.

      "byline": "Georgina Henry",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For some, Tuscany, like Islington, is a place that conjures up a particular image. But how perverse it would be to avoid it just because Tony Blair holidays there and certain types of English men and women own grand homes on the gentle slopes of some of the most beautiful countryside in Italy. </p> <p>And the popular caricature is not, of course, the whole story. Head west from Florence to Lucca, and north up into the mountains and you come to the remotest corner of Tuscany, where the most isolated medieval villages have not been repopulated by rich outsiders and are clinging as perilously to life as they are to the rugged hills. </p> <p>Any village more than 20km from the main road is probably doomed as the population ages and the young move to homes within easy reach of the Garfagnana valley, which contains some of Europe's largest paper mills and is the main source of local employment. </p> <p>Our destination was San Romano, about 10km off the main road that snakes through the valley and a two-hour drive from Florence airport. Forewarned that although it passed the accessibility test and is a thriving if sleepy hamlet, it contains only one tiny shop and no bar, we stopped off at the municipal centre of Borgo a Mozzano to buy provisions from the old-fashioned little shop on the main street. The staff speak no English, like most people in the valley, but they are cheerful, patient, very friendly and seem genuinely pleased to see you again. There is a reasonable selection of hams and cheeses and local wines, and the chicken we bought was easily the best poultry I can remember. Only the bread - not a speciality of Tuscany, or of Italy for that matter - was a disappointment; it's baked with very little salt or none at all, and is as hard as rock by next morning. </p> <p>A short drive from Borgo and we struck off the highway and into the mountain, a steep and narrow road with twists and turns and blind corners that takes you eventually to Casa al Colle, an old stone, irregularly-shaped farmhouse built into the side of the hill around 1760 by the local landlord. It lay semi-derelict for a long time until the present owners, Fiorella and Thomas, refurbished it a couple of years ago. </p> <p>It's charm is apparent the moment you pull up on the gravel drive. Throw the shutters open in the morning and you will see the sun come up over the mountains, San Romano in the heavily- wooded valley below, and, away on a distant mountaintop, the beautiful but dying medieval village of Motrone. </p> <p>One of Casa al Colle's main attractions is its remoteness: if it's peace and quiet you're looking for, this is the place to go. However, its isolation, and the terror of the drive up the hairpin bends, can be a major disincentive to going anywhere other than up the stone steps to the pool in the morning. That would be a mistake, however: the region is rich in history and beautiful mountain villages, the magnificent walled town of Lucca is less than an hour away (except if you get stuck behind the endless and very slow paper trucks in the single-lane road through the valley) and Florence, Siena, Pisa and the coast are within easy reach. </p> <p>Before the coming of the paper mills, the Garfagnana valley was one of the poorest regions of Tuscany - the road to San Romano was not even paved until the 60s. Work was scarce, and so the young people migrated to the cities. There is a missing generation - people in their 40s and 50s, the ones who left before the coming of roads and employment. A few of them have snuck back with their young families to take advantage of the jobs and depressed property prices and to bring up their children in the safety of the countryside. </p> <p>But with steady depopulation - Motrone is not the only dying village - the demographic profile is essentially old people, old people, more old people and a handful of The Good Lifers with their kids. There are outsiders in the more accessible villages and hamlets along the Garfagnana valley, many of them writers and painters who live there permanently, rather than holiday in the summer months. It says a lot about Italians that there seems to be an almost complete absence of resentment about this, and little hostility directed towards foreigners. Small-scale agri-tourism and bed and breakfasting is an important part of the local economy, but it really only works if it's relatively near the main road. San Romano is borderline in this regard. </p> <p>If what you've come for is to rest and recharge the batteries you won't be disappointed because Lucca is definitely worth the trip. It's probably best simply to wander at random through the streets. Every time you turn a corner there'll be something to admire. The local people use the walls - \"the living room of Lucca\" - to socialise and to promenade in the evenings. It's a good way to get a feel for the layout of the town. Take the time to enjoy the local apperitif, Chiodino - white wine or spumanti with a drop of Campari. </p> <p>As for eating in Lucca, the tourists throng the restaurants around the Piazza Puccini. It's hard to have a bad meal here. Mushrooms are big in the Garfagnana valley, and an awful lot of dishes come with the celebrated porcini. But if you're fed up with funghi, there are plenty of alternatives. Try the faro soup with bacon and beans, the crostini with black butter, or the lardo with honey (forget about the calories - you're on holiday). </p> <p>And because of the area's historic poverty, the local people have developed interesting ways to cook poor vegetables.

      "bodyText": "For some, Tuscany, like Islington, is a place that conjures up a particular image. But how perverse it would be to avoid it just because Tony Blair holidays there and certain types of English men and women own grand homes on the gentle slopes of some of the most beautiful countryside in Italy. And the popular caricature is not, of course, the whole story. Head west from Florence to Lucca, and north up into the mountains and you come to the remotest corner of Tuscany, where the most isolated medieval villages have not been repopulated by rich outsiders and are clinging as perilously to life as they are to the rugged hills. Any village more than 20km from the main road is probably doomed as the population ages and the young move to homes within easy reach of the Garfagnana valley, which contains some of Europe's largest paper mills and is the main source of local employment. Our destination was San Romano, about 10km off the main road that snakes through the valley and a two-hour drive from Florence airport. Forewarned that although it passed the accessibility test and is a thriving if sleepy hamlet, it contains only one tiny shop and no bar, we stopped off at the municipal centre of Borgo a Mozzano to buy provisions from the old-fashioned little shop on the main street. The staff speak no English, like most people in the valley, but they are cheerful, patient, very friendly and seem genuinely pleased to see you again. There is a reasonable selection of hams and cheeses and local wines, and the chicken we bought was easily the best poultry I can remember. Only the bread - not a speciality of Tuscany, or of Italy for that matter - was a disappointment; it's baked with very little salt or none at all, and is as hard as rock by next morning. A short drive from Borgo and we struck off the highway and into the mountain, a steep and narrow road with twists and turns and blind corners that takes you eventually to Casa al Colle, an old stone, irregularly-shaped farmhouse built into the side of the hill around 1760 by the local landlord. It lay semi-derelict for a long time until the present owners, Fiorella and Thomas, refurbished it a couple of years ago. It's charm is apparent the moment you pull up on the gravel drive. Throw the shutters open in the morning and you will see the sun come up over the mountains, San Romano in the heavily- wooded valley below, and, away on a distant mountaintop, the beautiful but dying medieval village of Motrone. One of Casa al Colle's main attractions is its remoteness: if it's peace and quiet you're looking for, this is the place to go. However, its isolation, and the terror of the drive up the hairpin bends, can be a major disincentive to going anywhere other than up the stone steps to the pool in the morning. That would be a mistake, however: the region is rich in history and beautiful mountain villages, the magnificent walled town of Lucca is less than an hour away (except if you get stuck behind the endless and very slow paper trucks in the single-lane road through the valley) and Florence, Siena, Pisa and the coast are within easy reach. Before the coming of the paper mills, the Garfagnana valley was one of the poorest regions of Tuscany - the road to San Romano was not even paved until the 60s. Work was scarce, and so the young people migrated to the cities. There is a missing generation - people in their 40s and 50s, the ones who left before the coming of roads and employment. A few of them have snuck back with their young families to take advantage of the jobs and depressed property prices and to bring up their children in the safety of the countryside. But with steady depopulation - Motrone is not the only dying village - the demographic profile is essentially old people, old people, more old people and a handful of The Good Lifers with their kids. There are outsiders in the more accessible villages and hamlets along the Garfagnana valley, many of them writers and painters who live there permanently, rather than holiday in the summer months. It says a lot about Italians that there seems to be an almost complete absence of resentment about this, and little hostility directed towards foreigners. Small-scale agri-tourism and bed and breakfasting is an important part of the local economy, but it really only works if it's relatively near the main road. San Romano is borderline in this regard. If what you've come for is to rest and recharge the batteries you won't be disappointed because Lucca is definitely worth the trip. It's probably best simply to wander at random through the streets. Every time you turn a corner there'll be something to admire. The local people use the walls - \"the living room of Lucca\" - to socialise and to promenade in the evenings. It's a good way to get a feel for the layout of the town. Take the time to enjoy the local apperitif, Chiodino - white wine or spumanti with a drop of Campari. As for eating in Lucca, the tourists throng the restaurants around the Piazza Puccini. It's hard to have a bad meal here. Mushrooms are big in the Garfagnana valley, and an awful lot of dishes come with the celebrated porcini. But if you're fed up with funghi, there are plenty of alternatives. Try the faro soup with bacon and beans, the crostini with black butter, or the lardo with honey (forget about the calories - you're on holiday). And because of the area's historic poverty, the local people have developed interesting ways to cook poor vegetables. Try the zuppa alla frantoiana, made mostly from black cabbage, carrots and celery. Formerly hardy peasant food, it is now served in all the smartest restaurants. Similarly, the flat sweet bread made from farina di castagne (chestnut-flower bread), eaten with cheese, is now considered a delicacy, though during the worst days of the second world war this bread was about all that people had to eat. The wine of the region is not particularly special. The best white is from Montecarlo, near Lucca, which sells for about L11,000 (half the price of a bottle of run-of-the-mill Australian or French), and the best red is the Colline Lucchesi, which costs a little more. While even the proudest Lucchesi would hesitate to boast about the wine, they will tell you that the local olive oil is not only the best in in Tuscany but outshines anything from the other regions of Italy. It is light and fruity, and you should bring home as many bottles of this wonderful stuff as you can carry. Another highlight is Barga, a small and pretty cathedral town, its splendour partly explained by the one-time residence of the Borgias. The walking around Casa al Colle isn't great - too steep and too heavily forested - but the nearby Apuane Alps, much wilder than the Apennines, with gorges, ravines and caves, offer a spectacular alternative. In common with the rest of the province, they offer a relaxing, unpretentious taste of Tuscany. The practicals One week's self catering at Casa al Colle in Borgo a Mozzano in Lucca, costs \u00a31,430, sleeping up to ten, between now and April 7 from Cottages to Castles (01622 726 883, www.cottagestocastles.com).

      "body": "<p>After gaining a few weeks of experience, all intermediate skiers aspire to mastering <strong> parallel turns</strong>. In theory, the first part of a parallel turn should be the easiest, because gravity is already trying to pull your skis down the hill, in the direction you want to go. But as you're traversing, before starting a turn, your skis are tilted on to their uphill edges. While you're \"holding an edge\" like this, your skis are resisting the pull of gravity down the hill. To go from a traverse to a new parallel turn, you need to release those edges by flattening your skis, and then eventually rolling them on to their opposite edges - the \"new\" edges that will control the new turn. </p> <p>There are two ways to learn the initiation of parallel turns: the \"drift initiation\", and the \"hop initiation\". </p> <p>With the former, you need to extend from the traverse position (where the body is angulated into a curved shape), and stand upright, into the \"neutral position\". Your skis will flatten, allowing them to drift naturally down towards the pull of gravity. Once the turn is underway, you can roll the skis on to the new edges, and drive them around the rest of the turn. With practice, you will learn to speed up the drift initiation, by using a swivelling movement of the feet. This is also described by various ski schools as a \"rotary\", \"pivoting\", or \"steering\" movement. </p> <p>The hop initiation is a learning method better suited to children and more athletically built adults. It is based on the same movement as the drift initiation, extending from an angulated traverse position into the neutral position, but is done more dynamically. This extension of the body should result in a hop, where the skis leave the ground. As the skis are in the air, the aforementioned swivelling movement of the feet is used to start them turning. As the skis regain contact with the snow, they should already be tilted on to the new edges, so that the remainder of the turn can be completed. </p> <p>The problem that most novice parallel skiers have is an inability to release both edges simultaneously, and tip both skis together on to their new edges. They generally find it easy enough to do it with the new outside ski (ie the right ski when turning left) because of all their experience with stemming. But the problem is getting the new inside ski to do the same thing at the same time. Therefore, some teachers ask the pupil to concentrate on the new inside foot (ie the left foot when turning left), and focus on tilting it from the \"big toe edge\" over on to the \"little toe edge\". </p> <p>Whichever method you use to get the hang of the parallel turn initiation, that is only half the battle. Also you must get into the habit of making a pole-plant. This should be done at the same time as you extend your body upwards to start the turn. For shorter, rhythmical turns, it provides a vital link to the snow during the almost weightless transi tion phase between turns, and it helps stabilise the upper body - for all turns, but especially for short, quick-rhythm ones, the upper body (above the waist) should remain facing permanently down the hill. </p> <p>This has two advantages: in short turns, it enables you to turn your skis simply by pivoting your legs beneath you, instead of rotating your whole body each time - this uses less energy and increases your nimbleness - and, in long turns, keeping your upper body facing down the hill has the automatic effect of keeping your hips angulated into the turn, helping to keep your skis on edge. </p> <p><strong>Next week</strong>: angulation of both the knees and the hips in the context of carved parallel turns.

He informed me, in a seductive Italian accent, that I would be covered in hot mud every day. And then I would be hosed down and placed in a bubbling tub. Then I would take to my bed for an hour, after which the day would be mine - fashion shows, exfoliations, excursions... I would, he soothed, soon feel the benefit. \"Perhaps lose a few kilos, no?\" Another flash of the Persil teeth. </p> <p>I had come to the town of Abano Terme with a back injury, having heard about the magical curative properties of its thermal waters. I imagined sulphurous corridors, spartan regimes and gaunt inmates in dressing gowns. But, I reasoned, with Venice just an hour away, and the gorgeous city of Padua right on its doorstep, I could always escape if it got too depressing. </p> <p>But I had got it wildly wrong. For as I soon discovered, this elegant little spa town with its clutch of fancy hotels is almost entirely given over to pleasure. Street stalls stock paperbacks on erotic massage and horoscopes for your dog. Full-fat ice cream parlours proliferate, spangly boutiques line the streets. </p> <p>There are evening concerts, waltzes, elaborate aperitifs and courteous waiters; the leafy boulevards encourage short strolls in pretty frocks. It is an intensely sociable place - as it was in its heyday, when Europe's glitterati took the cure in one of the most fashionable spa resorts of the Belle Epoque. </p> <p>In such a determinedly hedonistic atmosphere, it is easy to forget the the real business of Abano Terme. And after a fabulous five-course dinner in the five-star Hotel Trieste e Vittoria, I, too, had forgotten what I was doing here. My timetable, however, decreed \"fangotherapy\" at 9am the next morning. There was no getting out of it. </p> <p>So I donned my white robe and shuffled along to the mud suite. Men wheeling trollies of what looked like steaming potter's clay - \"fango\" - trundled up and down the corridors. A whiff of bad eggs hung in the air. Algae-rich and warmed by thermal water, this was no ordinary mud. The Romans swore by it. Madonna swears by it, too. Many of Abano's clients spend a fortnight here twice a year. But to mud virgins like me, the prospect was faintly terrifying. </p> <p>\"Signorina, please, it's good for you.\" White-coated Bertilla, grandmotherly and reassuring, propelled me into a cubicle and eased me backwards onto the bed of steaming gunge. Naked. Oof! It was hot - 40 degrees, according to the doctor's prescription - and squelched horribly. </p> <p>Having wrestled my shoulders, one arm, hips, knees and ankles into 45kg of mud, Bertilla wrapped me in grey linen, set a timer and left the cubicle. I felt like an Egyptian mummy in a furnace. The heat fought its way to my core, needling stiff joints, penetrating to my bones. Alarm gave way to exhaustion. Beads of sweat trickled down my chin. </p> <p>I was woken by Bertilla tenderly wiping my brow and loosening my wrappings. \"Piano, piano, signorina.\" The mud was prised off, I was heaved upright, hosed down and guided into my ozone bath, where I floated groggily for 15 minutes. </p> <p>For the first two days I fought the system. I felt over-pampered, guilty, lethargic. My mind was vegetating. I had to escape. Padua was a 10-minute bus ride away, and ploughing into the rush-hour traffic of vespas, vegetable vans and Alfa Romeos, I felt myself wake up again. A lively university city, Padua is big enough to be interesting - Giotto's frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel were worth the trip alone; there was also a Baroque music festival in full swing. </p> <p>Then it was back to the cossetted world of the spa where, by day four, I was contemplating liposuction for the simple reason that the food was exquisite; Italy's best, served with great speed and silver-domed ceremony by a personal waiter. Sparrow-like ladies, dressed as if for a Cannes film premiere, ate their way through five courses twice a day without batting an eyelid. Their husbands, magnificent paunches straining through jacket and tie, did the same without reproach. Often no word would pass between them, the ladies' eyelids lifting only to flutter, coyly, at passing waiters. </p> <p>Before dinner, the ritual stroll was a fashion parade without any concession to subtlety - handbags, sunglasses and sandals all flashed with gold. But it was more entertaining than intimidating, and before long I was competing as best as I could despite my pitifully un-spangly wardrobe. Next year, I told myself, I would pack far more outrageously. </p> <p>Next year? Yes, I admit it. I was utterly seduced. Italy is, incurably, a pleasure-loving country - whether expressed through exuberant architecture, spangly boutiques, or simple physical pampering. It is hard not to give in to it on every level. After one week, I truly felt a new person - but couldn't put my finger on the precise nature of the \"cure\". Was it the mud, the thermal waters, or the general atmosphere of happy indulgence? Sometimes a little frivolity is just what is needed. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Thermalia Travel (020-7483 1898, <a href=\"http://www.thermalia.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thermalia.co.uk</a>) offers one week at the five-star Grand Hotel Trieste e Vittoria, Abano Terme near Padua, from \u00a31,025pp, including scheduled flights, full board, plus daily fango, ozone bath and massage.

Then it was back to the cossetted world of the spa where, by day four, I was contemplating liposuction for the simple reason that the food was exquisite; Italy's best, served with great speed and silver-domed ceremony by a personal waiter. Sparrow-like ladies, dressed as if for a Cannes film premiere, ate their way through five courses twice a day without batting an eyelid. Their husbands, magnificent paunches straining through jacket and tie, did the same without reproach. Often no word would pass between them, the ladies' eyelids lifting only to flutter, coyly, at passing waiters. Before dinner, the ritual stroll was a fashion parade without any concession to subtlety - handbags, sunglasses and sandals all flashed with gold. But it was more entertaining than intimidating, and before long I was competing as best as I could despite my pitifully un-spangly wardrobe. Next year, I told myself, I would pack far more outrageously. Next year? Yes, I admit it. I was utterly seduced. Italy is, incurably, a pleasure-loving country - whether expressed through exuberant architecture, spangly boutiques, or simple physical pampering. It is hard not to give in to it on every level. After one week, I truly felt a new person - but couldn't put my finger on the precise nature of the \"cure\". Was it the mud, the thermal waters, or the general atmosphere of happy indulgence? Sometimes a little frivolity is just what is needed. The practicals Thermalia Travel (020-7483 1898, www.thermalia.co.uk) offers one week at the five-star Grand Hotel Trieste e Vittoria, Abano Terme near Padua, from \u00a31,025pp, including scheduled flights, full board, plus daily fango, ozone bath and massage.

      "body": "<p>I was about to turn 40 and looking for somewhere to hide out with my partner until it was all over. Rome was the perfect destination: cheap tickets were available online, the city would provide a suitably epic backdrop for a big occasion and surprisingly, neither of us had ever visited it before. </p> <p>By the time you get to 40, you pride yourself on having acquired a certain degree of competence. You know how to get results. But minutes after arriving in Rome, it feels as though all those painfully-acquired life skills are starting to slip away. First there's the white-knuckle taxi ride from the airport, which has us scrabbling like infants for our rear seat-belts (they prove to be for show purposes only), then helplessly handing over bundles of lire when the requested price proves to be double the sum on the meter. </p> <p>Walking turns out to be no less of a problem. Emerging from our hotel - the super-chic new Hotel de Russie, just off the Piazza del Popolo (9 Via del Babuino, tel: 39 06 32 88 81, single rooms from L590,000, doubles from L800,000) - we find ourselves among the promenading hordes. Of course, we've heard about la passeggiata; we just didn't know that in Rome it goes on all day. And a warm Sunday afternoon in autumn gives locals an ideal opportunity to show off their world-beating array of shiny leather suits and snakeskin hipsters. Whether the stiffness of the leather restricts movement, or new outfits have to be run in at low speed, like a new car engine, the shopping streets are virtually impassable, and what looks on the map like a short stroll turns into a Versace-clad obstacle course. </p> <p>Our next challenge arises when we decide to get some lunch. We want our first Italian meal in Rome to be perfect, and having wandered around the area, we're reassured to see a large number of promising-looking trattorias with pavement tables. But at 2pm, it's as though a lunch bell has sounded, and suddenly every restaurant has a queue outside, right down to the humblest pizza chain. We beat a retreat to a cavernous pizzeria. Forty minutes later, we're still waiting to be brought so much as a piece of bread. When our pizzas do eventually arrive, though, they're worth the wait - yeasty and crisp-based in the Roman style. </p> <p>Happily, this first dining experience turns out not to be typical. Despite their reputation, Romans aren't unfriendly to tourists. We just don't seem to register with them. Which is great, if you hate being hassled by people trying to sell you things. The centurions posing for photos outside the Colosseum are as near as Rome comes to pandering to the tourist trade. </p> <p>After our lunch experience, we are even more determined to find the perfect, mythical trattoria. Our pre-dinner stroll takes in the huge monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II, inaugurated in 1911 to celebrate the unification of the nation but often dismissively referred to as \"the wedding cake\". Then on to the Spanish Steps, where the mating call of hundreds of suburban adolescents rises on the evening breeze. </p> <p>Next, the Trevi fountain, immortalised in La Dolce Vita. We are overwhelmed by the size and swagger of the rococo marble confection, with its underwater carpet of glinting coins. I'm only left standing alone for a moment, gazing into the fountain's depths, when a soulful young man sidles up to me, and asks whether I speak Italian. Had I indeed been able to speak Italian, I could have snapped \"What are you playing at? I'm going to be 40 tomorrow!\" As it is, I flash him my biggest Anita Ekberg smile while backing away. Oh well, when in Rome...</p> <p>Around the corner from the Parliament building, we stumble across what looks like our ideal, untouristy little trattoria. At first, it seems perfect. It obviously hasn't been decorated since Mussolini's day, and its handful of tables are filled with laughing groups of students and other bohemian types. There's no written menu - a shy waitress recites the evening's choices - three pastas and two meat dishes. It's only after we've ordered that we notice the state of the kitchen and, even more alarming, the state of its only occupant, a mountainous, be-slippered female straight from the kitchen of Castle Gormenghast. </p> <p>Perfectly good though our spinach and ricotta ravioli turns out to be, this place falls just on the wrong side of authentic. We resolve to do some research and book somewhere really good for tomorrow night's birthday dinner. </p> <p>How can we go wrong with Il Convivio (31,Vicolo dei Soldati, tel:06 686 9432)? It's listed in the \"splashing out\" section of our guidebook as \"a temple of foodie excellence\". And temple is just about right. From its forbidding wooden door and whispering waiters, to the reverential near-silence of its clientele, this is a place of worship rather than enjoyment. The food is predictably fantastic, in the teased-up, whittled-down style peculiar to Michelin-starred restaurants. But the best dish is the simplest: a heap of fresh, buttery tagliatelle, over which our waiter grates white truffle until I tell him to stop - rather a hair-raising judgment call, as I've been given a menu with no prices on it. In the end, our meal comes to around \u00a3100, which is less than we'd feared. </p> <p>On the last full day of our Roman holiday, we abandon any pretence of sightseeing, and concentrate on finding our dream restaurant. The breakthrough comes with our discovery of the Bar Notegen (159 Via del Babuino tel: 06 320 0855). Seemingly unchanged since the 1950s, it's a snug, wood-panelled room lined with old black-and-white photos of Italian actors and artists. This feels very much like Fellini country - the director lived nearby - and some of the characters who hang around the Notegen still seem to be auditioning for a part in one of his movies. </p> <p>That evening, just around the corner from the Notegen - and our hotel - we finally find our perfect vision of a Roman trattoria. The Edy (4 Vicolo del Babuino, tel: 06 36 00 17 38) has everything - a glowing, candle-lit interior, warm and welcoming staff, a chef who pops out from the kitchen to see how his dishes are going down, cooed-over infants in high chairs munching on breadsticks. And most importantly, really great cooking. Seafood spaghetti is baked in a foil parcel, which is brought to the table to spill its aromatic contents. Bean and pasta soup is thick enough to stand a spoon in. Grilled lamb cutlets bring out the Ancient Roman in me, and I'm soon attacking them with both hands. </p> <p>No doubt there are hundreds of restaurants in Rome as unpretentious, friendly and atmospheric as the Edy. But we didn't have the time to find them all. </p> <p>However, during our brief stay we managed to take in a fair number of Rome's most famous sights. Inevitably, though, things got left off the list. We didn't make it to the Sistine Chapel, or inside Saint Peter's. Instead, we opted to avoid the crowds of pilgrims by walking around the Vatican City late at night. This turned out to be a good move - we found ourselves alone in the square in front of the magnificently-spotlit cathedral as its bells tolled midnight, the only spectators at a spooky son et lumi\u00e8re. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>British Airways Holidays (0870 24 24 243, <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/\">www.britishairways.com/ holiday/holiday.shtml</a>), Citalia (020-8686 0677, <a href=\"http://www.citalia.co.uk,\">www.citalia.co.uk</a>), Italian Journeys (020-7373 8058), Thomson Breakaway (0870 606 1476), Travelscene (0870 777 4445, <a href=\"http://www.travelscene.co.uk,\">www.travelscene.co.uk</a>), and the Magic of Italy (08700 270 500, <a href=\"http://www.magictravelgroup.co.uk\">www.magictravelgroup.co.uk</a>) are some of the companies that offer packages to Rome.

This, however, may have something to do with the fact that with no building higher than a pine tree, most of the resort nestles unobtrusively among the trees and series of low hillocks. </p> <p>What is obvious though is the virtual absence of any traffic or bustle, which results in a silence and calm that remains unbroken for the whole week of my stay. </p> <p>On my first morning, after a potentially overwhelming smorgasbord breakfast at my temporary residence, Fjellstoge Lodge, there was just time to pick up the equipment before heading to the gentle nursery slopes where my group are to have our first lessons. The band of a dozen beginners was a mixed bunch, in terms of both age and experience. </p> <p>The first thing we learned was that the key to a cross-country skier's ability lies in the boots. As snug and comfy as your favourite slippers, cross-country boots are attached to the ski only at the front, crucially leaving the heel free at the back. </p> <p>The first two mornings were then spent being taught by Katherine, our British instructor, who was soon helping us gain the confidence we needed. We began by skiing in tracks, or \"tramlines\", that are cut by machines into the snow and into which your skis snugly fit. The length of these tracks can vary from a few kilometres in a valley bottom to a vast network, sometimes floodlit, through forests and over hills. </p> <p>Come lunchtime, we'd nip back to the lodge to eat a packed lunch washed down with mugs of hot chocolate. In the afternoons, our newly acquired skills were put to the test when we were led out by Katherine for a two-hour off-track tour around the frozen Lake Kvit vatn at the back of the lodge. </p> <p>Each day we'd be out skiing for six hours both on and off track, and by the late afternoon when the sun was starting to send the temperature tumbling, I was always looking forward to getting back to base and being able to dive into the sauna.

      "body": "<p><strong> Why?</strong> We went for a week last summer and stayed in the Plaza, a 1920s hotel. It was a bit of a gamble because it was the first time we'd taken our two children, Emily and Oscar, to stay in a hotel, but it was great. The Plaza is like one of those old English seaside hotels but with a bit more art-deco style, a bit more haw-hi-haw. There's also an old casino in Biarritz, so there's this strange feeling of stepping back in time. The thing we loved about it, though, was the golden, sandy beach, which reminded us of a cross between Cornwall and the Gold Coast of Australia. The tide goes out a long way so the kids can safely wander out, but there's also quite a bit of surf - there are a lot French surfies and Brits who go there. Being a proper Australian, my wife Margot did a bit of body surfing; I need slightly bigger waves to move me. </p> <p><strong> What's the best thing?</strong> The thing I loved about it - and this is probably typical me - was the fact that you had a choice of not just French food but Basque, too, because it's so close to Spain - paellas, platters of mussels and oysters, tapas, that sort of thing. It's also more relaxed because of the Basque influence, it's great for walking around, and you don't really need a car. </p> <p><strong> My perfect day:</strong> Going to the Chocolate Museum of Biarritz. Margot said we were going to walk there after breakfast one day, but we found it was a lot further away than we thought, it took an hour and a half, and we got there just as it was closing for lunch. We bought lots of fantastic Henriet of Biarritz chocolate though and scoffed it as we walked back in the drizzle. Then we had a nice little lunch, the sun came out and we went swimming. It was one of those four seasons in one day. </p> <p><strong> My advice:</strong> After you've spoiled yourself in other parts of France, go to Biarritz and have a very healthy, laid-back beach-side holiday. </p> <p>\u0095 Jonathan 'Jono' Coleman presents the breakfast show on Heart 106.2 FM from 6.30am-9am.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why? We went for a week last summer and stayed in the Plaza, a 1920s hotel. It was a bit of a gamble because it was the first time we'd taken our two children, Emily and Oscar, to stay in a hotel, but it was great. The Plaza is like one of those old English seaside hotels but with a bit more art-deco style, a bit more haw-hi-haw. There's also an old casino in Biarritz, so there's this strange feeling of stepping back in time. The thing we loved about it, though, was the golden, sandy beach, which reminded us of a cross between Cornwall and the Gold Coast of Australia. The tide goes out a long way so the kids can safely wander out, but there's also quite a bit of surf - there are a lot French surfies and Brits who go there. Being a proper Australian, my wife Margot did a bit of body surfing; I need slightly bigger waves to move me. What's the best thing? The thing I loved about it - and this is probably typical me - was the fact that you had a choice of not just French food but Basque, too, because it's so close to Spain - paellas, platters of mussels and oysters, tapas, that sort of thing. It's also more relaxed because of the Basque influence, it's great for walking around, and you don't really need a car. My perfect day: Going to the Chocolate Museum of Biarritz. Margot said we were going to walk there after breakfast one day, but we found it was a lot further away than we thought, it took an hour and a half, and we got there just as it was closing for lunch. We bought lots of fantastic Henriet of Biarritz chocolate though and scoffed it as we walked back in the drizzle. Then we had a nice little lunch, the sun came out and we went swimming. It was one of those four seasons in one day. My advice: After you've spoiled yourself in other parts of France, go to Biarritz and have a very healthy, laid-back beach-side holiday. \u0095 Jonathan 'Jono' Coleman presents the breakfast show on Heart 106.2 FM from 6.30am-9am.",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott yesterday signalled an unmistakable climbdown over plans to part-privatise the London tube when he announced that he had asked Ken Livingstone's transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, to \"modify\" the government's public-private partnership for the underground. The move, following weeks of negotiations with Mr Kiley and the direct intervention of Tony Blair, represents a notable victory for Mr Livingstone, who made opposition to the partial selloff of the London Underground the central plank of his bid to become the capital's first elected mayor. Under the terms of a compromise deal finalised between Mr Prescott and Mr Kiley yesterday morning, the transport commissioner will draw up changes to the government scheme, tenders and contracts, with the aim of maintaining unified management control of the tube. Monday's tube strike over safety by the traindrivers' union Aslef will still go ahead in the absence of management assurances and in an atmosphere which the union said had been poisoned by the outlawing of parallel industrial action by the Rail Maritime and Transport union. In the wake of the Hatfield rail disaster, widely blamed on the fragmentation of the mainline network under privatisation, the prospect of a similar breakup of control of London Underground has been a key factor in laying the ground for the shift in the government's thinking. The appointment of the internationally respected Mr Kiley, the breadth of opposition to the partial selloff across the political spectrum, the threat of legal action and industrial disruption in the run-up to a general election also helped to convince the government to change course. Mr Livingstone hailed the agreement as a \"victory for Londoners after months of deadlock\" and went out of his way to praise the efforts made by Mr Prescott - as opposed to the Treasury, which has been criticised by Mr Kiley for its role in the negotiations - to shift the government line. The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, said the deal between Mr Prescott and Mr Kiley amounted to a \"crushing\" defeat for the deputy prime minister, who had been forced to admit his plans were \"deeply flawed\". Mr Kiley, the man credited with turning round the New York subway, will submit his revised plans for a public-sector controlled modernisation of the tube by the end of the month. If they are accepted by the government, the existing private consortia will be invited to bid for new contracts. The likelihood is now that those contracts will not involve the breakup of the tube, nor the 30-year handover of stations, track and signalling to private compa nies envisaged under the government's scheme - if so, the \"modifications\" will be seen as marking a significant retreat in its wider part-privatisation programme for the public services. Mr Kiley said there were still points of difference between himself and the government, but those differences were \"narrowing\". Mr Prescott's department emphasised that there had been compromise on both sides, but the deputy prime minister left open the possibility that Mr Kiley's changes to the part-privatisation scheme might still be rejected, while praising Mr Kiley's \"strong management team\" and emphasising that they would be \"working closely\" together to \"enhance\" the existing plans. The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, insisted that the government had \"ruled nothing out and nothing in\", adding that \"unified management is a very big issue and that is a question we will be mulling over in the next few weeks\". The agreement was welcomed by business organisations in London. Peter Bishop, acting chief executive of the London chamber of commerce, said that Mr Kiley was \"clearly a man the government can do business with\". \"He will have to operate the system once the new arrangements are in place and it would have been untenable to proceed if he were not convinced they are workable.\" London Underground chairman and managing director, Derek Smith, described the deal as a \"platform to move forward\" after a funding structure that had been \"hit and miss\" for most of the last four decades. The agreement means that Mr Kiley, who has described the government's partial selloff plan as \"fatally flawed\", will finally have full access to all commercial details of the existing contracts and will take control of negotiations with the private consortia bidding to modernise the tube. Some of the companies involved in bidding for the existing multi-billion pound contracts yesterday privately expressed anger at the government's last-minute change of heart - the contracts were supposed to have been finalised by the end of last month - but a spokeswoman for Mr Prescott said that the decision would not have \"come as the most massive surprise\" to them.",

      "body": "<p>Whoever Mario Lanza was imploring to Come Back to Sorrento, I only hope they made straight for the Hotel Excelsior Vittoria. </p> <p>Our intention was to try a week's self-catering sandwiched in between two short hotel stays that would allow for some pampering. Certainly the Excelsior Vittoria did not let us down in that department, recapturing as it does some sense of past grandeur when celebrities such as Caruso were regular patrons. </p> <p>Conveniently situated at the heart of Sorrento, it is insulated from the noise and bustle of the Piazza Tasso (the Renaissance poet of the same name was born here) by extensive grounds that include an elegant swimming pool. The floors and walls of the interior are clad in gleaming marble, and the terrace and open-air restaurant (with excellent cuisine) afford stunning views across the bay of Naples. </p> <p>My wife and I had chosen the town because it is such a good base for sightseeing. Boats of all kinds ply back and forth to Naples, Capri, and Ischia, while the Circumvesuviana Railway offers cheap and frequent services to Pompeii and Herculaneum. </p> <p>Sorrento is built along the top of a high cliff, and getting up and down to the seafront can be a tiring and tedious trek. But the Excelsior Vittoria has its own private lift, which transports you straight from the terrace to the harbour. One morning we left our room at 9.10am, took the lift, bought a return ticket to Capri, stepped on to a hydrofoil, and disembarked at the Marina Grande 20 minutes later. </p> <p>By 10am, after a short trip on the funicular railway, we were each sipping a cappuccino in the sun outside the Gran Caf\u00e9 in the Piazzetta of Capri Town. The little square was swarming with people, but its charm survives the daily sea-borne invasion, and it doesn't take long to find peace and quiet on the island. We walked out of the town, up steep narrow alleys, shaded by trees and flowering shrubs, and blessedly free from motorised vehicles, to the ruined Villa Jovis which the Emperor Tiberius built as his retreat on the edge of a precipitous cliff from which those who offended him were hurled to their deaths. </p> <p>I had recently read Shirley Hazzard's memoir, Graham Greene on Capri, which describes this walk. We didn't have time to look for the novelist's villa in Anacapri, but we did have lunch - a buffet of tasty antipasti - at his favourite restaurant, Gemma, in Capri Town, which is reached by a quaint, crooked alley bored through the rock, and where his photograph is proudly displayed, pasted to the ceiling of the tiny lobby along with those of many other celebrities. </p> <p>Our other main excursion from Sorrento was Pompeii. I won't attempt to add anything to what so many literary visitors have said about this astonishing place over the centuries, except that the famous moulded corpses of the original inhabitants, preserved forever as they were at the moment when they were overwhelmed by volcanic ash, strongly reminded me of the statues of Anthony Gormley exhibited in the forecourt of the Royal Academy last year, and I wondered whether he was influenced by them. </p> <p>There seemed to be as many people in the streets of Pompeii as there must have been in AD79 when the wrath of Mount Vesuvius descended upon the inhabitants. Tourists squeezed into the Casa dei Vettii to look at the naughty frescos, like punters in a Soho peepshow. The pretty avenue that leads to the Villa dei Mysteri outside the walls was, however, comparatively empty, and you could easily picture it with togaed citizens and solid-wheeled ox-carts going up and down. </p> <p>The Amalfi Coast and its environs are spectacularly beautiful and full of historical interest, but also very crowded in the high season, and the topography pushes people even closer together. The corniche from Sorrento to Salerno is described by Michelin as the finest in Europe, but when we drove along it to our next destination I was too busy negotiating the blind hairpin bends, traffic jams and anarchic roadside parking to appreciate the scenery. It was a relief when, south of Salerno, the countryside became flatter, more open, and less densely populated. </p> <p>The Palazzo Belmonte is wedged into one end of Santa Maria di Castellabate, once a small fishing village and now a thriving seaside resort mainly patronised by Italian families.

The Palazzo has no air-conditioning, relying on its thick walls and high ceilings, which is fine in the more traditional apartments, into which we enviously peeped, but the gallery apartments must be uncomfortable in really hot weather. We were also disconcerted to find that our \"sit-out\" balcony faced out on to a public lane, above a row of dustbins, and, as a result, we made little use of it.

      "bodyText": "Whoever Mario Lanza was imploring to Come Back to Sorrento, I only hope they made straight for the Hotel Excelsior Vittoria. Our intention was to try a week's self-catering sandwiched in between two short hotel stays that would allow for some pampering. Certainly the Excelsior Vittoria did not let us down in that department, recapturing as it does some sense of past grandeur when celebrities such as Caruso were regular patrons. Conveniently situated at the heart of Sorrento, it is insulated from the noise and bustle of the Piazza Tasso (the Renaissance poet of the same name was born here) by extensive grounds that include an elegant swimming pool. The floors and walls of the interior are clad in gleaming marble, and the terrace and open-air restaurant (with excellent cuisine) afford stunning views across the bay of Naples. My wife and I had chosen the town because it is such a good base for sightseeing. Boats of all kinds ply back and forth to Naples, Capri, and Ischia, while the Circumvesuviana Railway offers cheap and frequent services to Pompeii and Herculaneum. Sorrento is built along the top of a high cliff, and getting up and down to the seafront can be a tiring and tedious trek. But the Excelsior Vittoria has its own private lift, which transports you straight from the terrace to the harbour. One morning we left our room at 9.10am, took the lift, bought a return ticket to Capri, stepped on to a hydrofoil, and disembarked at the Marina Grande 20 minutes later. By 10am, after a short trip on the funicular railway, we were each sipping a cappuccino in the sun outside the Gran Caf\u00e9 in the Piazzetta of Capri Town. The little square was swarming with people, but its charm survives the daily sea-borne invasion, and it doesn't take long to find peace and quiet on the island. We walked out of the town, up steep narrow alleys, shaded by trees and flowering shrubs, and blessedly free from motorised vehicles, to the ruined Villa Jovis which the Emperor Tiberius built as his retreat on the edge of a precipitous cliff from which those who offended him were hurled to their deaths. I had recently read Shirley Hazzard's memoir, Graham Greene on Capri, which describes this walk. We didn't have time to look for the novelist's villa in Anacapri, but we did have lunch - a buffet of tasty antipasti - at his favourite restaurant, Gemma, in Capri Town, which is reached by a quaint, crooked alley bored through the rock, and where his photograph is proudly displayed, pasted to the ceiling of the tiny lobby along with those of many other celebrities. Our other main excursion from Sorrento was Pompeii. I won't attempt to add anything to what so many literary visitors have said about this astonishing place over the centuries, except that the famous moulded corpses of the original inhabitants, preserved forever as they were at the moment when they were overwhelmed by volcanic ash, strongly reminded me of the statues of Anthony Gormley exhibited in the forecourt of the Royal Academy last year, and I wondered whether he was influenced by them. There seemed to be as many people in the streets of Pompeii as there must have been in AD79 when the wrath of Mount Vesuvius descended upon the inhabitants. Tourists squeezed into the Casa dei Vettii to look at the naughty frescos, like punters in a Soho peepshow. The pretty avenue that leads to the Villa dei Mysteri outside the walls was, however, comparatively empty, and you could easily picture it with togaed citizens and solid-wheeled ox-carts going up and down. The Amalfi Coast and its environs are spectacularly beautiful and full of historical interest, but also very crowded in the high season, and the topography pushes people even closer together. The corniche from Sorrento to Salerno is described by Michelin as the finest in Europe, but when we drove along it to our next destination I was too busy negotiating the blind hairpin bends, traffic jams and anarchic roadside parking to appreciate the scenery. It was a relief when, south of Salerno, the countryside became flatter, more open, and less densely populated. The Palazzo Belmonte is wedged into one end of Santa Maria di Castellabate, once a small fishing village and now a thriving seaside resort mainly patronised by Italian families. Fortunately, most of the new development has taken place at the other end. The ancient rooms of the Palazzo have been converted into apartments of various sizes, comfortably furnished and well equipped. It has a delightful flower-fringed swimming pool with bar, and a small private beach on the other side of the boundary wall. The beach is sandy and shelves gently - ideal for children. Lunch and dinner (if you don't want to cook your own or go out) are served under umbrellas on a grass terrace overlooking the sea, an ambience that seems more picnic than restaurant.

However, many teachers will get more from the \u00a3564m deal announced yesterday.</p> <p>New teachers receive a 6% rise, with other rank and file teachers getting increases on a sliding scale down to 3.7%. London allowances also increase by 30% as part of what Mr Blunkett described as a three Rs package - \"recruitment, retention and reward\".</p> <p>Schools will also have the option of encouraging teachers with \"golden handcuff\" bonuses of more than \u00a315,000 if they stay three years.</p> <p>Officials said the average teacher would earn \u00a327,900, compared with \u00a323,434 in March 1998.

      "bodyText": "Teachers' leaders in England and Wales last night dismissed as inadequate a pay rise of 3.7% and lambasted the education secretary, David Blunkett, for refusing to introduce the kind of package planned in Scotland. The rise from April is on a par with nurses and well above the headline inflation rate of 2.9%, but below the 4.2% average increase in earnings. However, many teachers will get more from the \u00a3564m deal announced yesterday. New teachers receive a 6% rise, with other rank and file teachers getting increases on a sliding scale down to 3.7%. London allowances also increase by 30% as part of what Mr Blunkett described as a three Rs package - \"recruitment, retention and reward\". Schools will also have the option of encouraging teachers with \"golden handcuff\" bonuses of more than \u00a315,000 if they stay three years. Officials said the average teacher would earn \u00a327,900, compared with \u00a323,434 in March 1998. Mr Blunkett angered unions by failing to follow the Scottish executive, which is phasing in a contracted 35-hour week and a maximum 25 hours' contact time.

In the new package, fresh recruits, who are crucial in a profession in which over half are over 45, will get a 6% rise, boosting their salaries to \u00a317,000 (or \u00a320,000 in inner London with its special weighting). Experienced teachers who pass the performance threshold - an expected 150,000 out of the 200,000 who have applied - will see their pay rise from \u00a324,000 to \u00a326,900 (or \u00a330,000 in London).

      "bodyText": "The government's flagship for a new type of local education authority outside London has been substantially changed in the face of a mutiny by the local Labour party and school staff. The schools minister, Estelle Morris, agreed yesterday to give Leeds city council full legal ownership of a joint venture company that is taking over the education authority after a highly critical Ofsted report a year ago. The switch abandons a plan to bolster the independence of the firm, EducationLeeds, by dividing ownership 50-50 between the council and the private sector. EducationLeeds' first chairman, Peter Ridsdale, chairman of Leeds United football club, said opposition to the plan had been made plain to him. \"I have spent a lot of time in the last four months visiting and listening to schools. I have heard what they say,\" he said. \"I have also been conscious that those staff who are providing support to schools have been very concerned.\" Protests at the takeover, which have included a march and moves towards a legal challenge, are likely to continue. Dave Roberts of Leeds' Campaign for State Education said the switch was a concession, but \"essentially a cosmetic change\". Leeds lost control of its \u00a3300m school education service after Ofsted highlighted political meddling in a report last February, which also described some support services as being in \"a parlous state\".",

The move, following weeks of negotiations with Mr Kiley and the direct intervention of Tony Blair, represents a notable victory for Mr Livingstone, who made opposition to the partial selloff of the London Underground the central plank of his bid to become the capital's first elected mayor. Under the terms of a compromise deal finalised between Mr Prescott and Mr Kiley yesterday morning, the transport commissioner will draw up changes to the government scheme, tenders and contracts, with the aim of maintaining unified management control of the tube. Monday's tube strike over safety by the traindrivers' union Aslef will still go ahead in the absence of management assurances and in an atmosphere which the union said had been poisoned by the outlawing of parallel industrial action by the Rail Maritime and Transport union. In the wake of the Hatfield rail disaster, widely blamed on the fragmentation of the mainline network under privatisation, the prospect of a similar breakup of control of London Underground has been a key factor in laying the ground for the shift in the government's thinking. The appointment of the internationally respected Mr Kiley, the breadth of opposition to the partial selloff across the political spectrum, the threat of legal action and industrial disruption in the run-up to a general election also helped to convince the government to change course. Mr Livingstone hailed the agreement as a \"victory for Londoners after months of deadlock\" and went out of his way to praise the efforts made by Mr Prescott - as opposed to the Treasury, which has been criticised by Mr Kiley for its role in the negotiations - to shift the government line. The shadow transport minister, Bernard Jenkin, said the deal between Mr Prescott and Mr Kiley amounted to a \"crushing\" defeat for the deputy prime minister, who had been forced to admit his plans were \"deeply flawed\". Mr Kiley, the man credited with turning round the New York subway, will submit his revised plans for a public-sector controlled modernisation of the tube by the end of the month. If they are accepted by the government, the existing private consortia will be invited to bid for new contracts. The likelihood is now that those contracts will not involve the breakup of the tube, nor the 30-year handover of stations, track and signalling to private compa nies envisaged under the government's scheme - if so, the \"modifications\" will be seen as marking a significant retreat in its wider part-privatisation programme for the public services. Mr Kiley said there were still points of difference between himself and the government, but those differences were \"narrowing\". Mr Prescott's department emphasised that there had been compromise on both sides, but the deputy prime minister left open the possibility that Mr Kiley's changes to the part-privatisation scheme might still be rejected, while praising Mr Kiley's \"strong management team\" and emphasising that they would be \"working closely\" together to \"enhance\" the existing plans. The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, insisted that the government had \"ruled nothing out and nothing in\", adding that \"unified management is a very big issue and that is a question we will be mulling over in the next few weeks\". The agreement was welcomed by business organisations in London. Peter Bishop, acting chief executive of the London chamber of commerce, said that Mr Kiley was \"clearly a man the government can do business with\". \"He will have to operate the system once the new arrangements are in place and it would have been untenable to proceed if he were not convinced they are workable.\" London Underground chairman and managing director, Derek Smith, described the deal as a \"platform to move forward\" after a funding structure that had been \"hit and miss\" for most of the last four decades. The agreement means that Mr Kiley, who has described the government's partial selloff plan as \"fatally flawed\", will finally have full access to all commercial details of the existing contracts and will take control of negotiations with the private consortia bidding to modernise the tube. Some of the companies involved in bidding for the existing multi-billion pound contracts yesterday privately expressed anger at the government's last-minute change of heart - the contracts were supposed to have been finalised by the end of last month - but a spokeswoman for Mr Prescott said that the decision would not have \"come as the most massive surprise\" to them.",

Indeed, in her recent, brilliant and completely bonkers book I'm a Man , the poet Ruth Padel makes that very claim, in mind-blown prose: \"It was ultimately Greek mythic ideals of relationship, quest, triumph and danger, of exploring self through impersonating other people, which powered this sci-fi mix of ancient and primitive, male and female, ultra-sophisticated electronics and crazed rawness, violence and darkness, all this theatrical dream of being male, in our time.\" </p> <p>Padel has a lot of interesting things to say about rock and gods, but almost nothing to say about rock and the good old-fashioned monotheistic God to whom many of the great rock and pop musicians of the 20th century paid lip-service. Al Green's extraordinary testimonial, Take Me to the River , puts God the Father back at centre stage: \"God has prepared Al Green for such a day as this, when I will lift my voice like the prophets of old to reveal His glory.\" </p> <p>The Reverend Al Green can be found serving God's glory these days at his church in Memphis, Tennessee, and also in his appearances in Ally McBeal , which he graces white-suited and with full gospel choir to serenade the eponymous heroine in her gradual descent into lip-syncing madness. But there was a period in the early 1970s, with \"Tired of Being Alone\", \"Let's Stay Together\", \"I'm Still in Love With You\", \"Call Me (Come Back Home)\" and \"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\", when Green was serving the Lord with some of the sweetest soul music ever to come out of the American south. </p> <p>Born into a sharecropping family in Arkansas in 1946, one of 10 children, Green started his singing career in church with his father and brothers as the Greene (sic) Brothers. After the family made the move north to Michigan and his father had thrown him out for playing Jackie Wilson's \"A Woman, A Lover, A Friend\" too often and too loudly, Green formed the Creations with Curtis Rogers and Palmer Jones, and they had their first and only hit as Al Greene and the Soul Mates in 1967 with \"Back Up Train\". </p> <p>It wasn't until Green went solo and teamed up with the legendary Willie Mitchell - band leader, producer and impresario - that he discovered his own unique style. Mitchell recognised what Green calls a \"surrendering feeling\" in his voice, and encouraged him to write his own material. What distinguishes both Green's delivery and his lyric writing to this day is its beguiling lack of force: there's no shouting, nor any of that horrible soothing that you get in a lot of soul and R&amp;B. It's not sentimental; it's genuinely sad. Of all the great soul voices, Green's perhaps expresses the greatest vulnerability. It's a voice seeking recognition. </p> <p>At first, there came no response. Green Is Blues , Green's first solo album, was released in the summer of 1969, but the first three singles from the album were a flop. Singles from the next album, Al Green Gets Next to You , didn't fare much better. The breakthrough came with the solid, chugging \"Can't Get Next to You\", and then, with increasing degrees of subtlety, \"Tired of Being Alone\", \"Let's Stay Together\" and \"Love and Happiness\". This early Hi Records sound isn't Stax, Motown or Atlantic - it's much smoother, with the drums high in the mix and the famous brothers Hodges creating the perfect rich complement to Green's apparent soft-spoken simplicity. You never get the feeling that he's having to fight the band. It's all obbligato . </p> <p>And also a winning of formula rather than just a winning formula: where Percy Sledge had gone before, trailblazing in 1966 with \"When a Man Loves a Woman\", the first big R&amp;B/pop crossover, Green followed, but in his own way and with a sound that appealed to black and white alike. With the release in 1974 of his seventh album, Al Green Explores Your Mind , Green looked set to consolidate his success. He was, as he says, \"in the groove\". He was also enjoying the considerable privileges - of every kind - to which a man of his celebrity feels entitled. \"Did I sin and then sin again,\" Green asks, \"with no thought to the consequences or the great and sure judgment I was bringing down upon myself?\" You bet he did. </p> <p>Then in October 1974 everything changed. As legend and The Virgin Encyclopedia of R&amp;B and Soul has it, \"Following an argument, his girlfriend, Mary Woodson, burst in while the singer was taking a bath and poured boiling grits over his back . . . a scarred and shaken Green vowed to devote more time to God.\" Green's version in Take Me to the River runs rather differently. Mary Woodson wasn't his girlfriend: she was one of several. And he wasn't in the bath: he was brushing his teeth. And he'd already been devoting more time to God since being born again and starting to speak in tongues in a hotel room in Anaheim, California, back in 1973. Whatever the details, the consequences are pretty much the same. Green sustained third- degree burns, and Woodson shot herself. If anything, Green now achieved an even greater, diabolical fame. The hits kept coming - \"L-O-V-E (Love)\" and \"Full of Fire\", both in 1975 - but something had come apart. </p> <p>In Take Me to the River Green attempts to pick up the pieces. \"Introducing the real Al Green,\" he says, \"is like introducing three different people, each one with his own point of view and each one with his own side of the story. And more often than not, they're all fighting with each other.\" These three Al Greens are, for reference, \"Al Green, the Last Great Soul Man; Al Green, the Country Preacher with the common touch; and Al Green, the family man\". The book is remarkable not for its candour or clarity, but because of these deep confusions, because it depicts a divided mind and tells the story of Green's seeking a wholeness that is not there to be had. This is also, one suspects, why people still listen to his songs. And incidentally, in case you were worrying, it's probably why you watch Ally McBeal .</p>",

Among his roles were those of poet, satirical wit, drinker, naval hero, duellist, kidnapper, philanderer, brothel-haunter, patron of the theatre, pornographer and public nuisance. Adored, banished, recalled, reviled, he died at home in bed, blind and in torment, of syphilis, aged 33. A deathbed convert to the Christianity he had formerly despised, he lived too soon to benefit from Pangloss's reflection that without syphilis we should never have had chocolate, though he might have seen the joke. </p> <p>Rochester was not a prolific or consistent poet. He could be fierce in defending the amateur's gift: \"Five Hundred Verses, every Morning writ,/ Proves you noe more a Poet, than a Wit\". His own poems show a fragmentary brilliance, and his fame has as much to do with his conduct as with his work, but even in a period whose major poetic figures include his friend the metaphysical poet, Andrew Marvell, and the ultimate literary professional, Dryden (with whom he quarrelled), Rochester's poems and letters stake a continuing claim to our attention. This is partly a matter of his complete disregard for decorum: his satire is based at least as much in personal loathing as in moral vision. </p> <p>\"A Ramble in St James's Park\" opens: \"Much wine had passed with grave discourse/ Of who fucks who and who does worse\", and describes a pleasure zone whose surplus of fallen semen meant that \"Rowes of Mandrakes tall did rise/ Whose lewd Topps Fuckt the very Skies\". If this were Rochester's only note, he wouldn't detain us. But his fleshy polymorphous relish, his sense that everyone's at it like knives with\"Signior Dildo\" and anything or anyone else they can get hold of, is combined with anger and hatred, often of women, and underlain by terror. \"Lampoone\" identifies the society names who carry \"A Fate, which no man can oppose,/ The losse of his heart and the fall of his Nose\". Nonetheless, he declared, in a translation from Ovid, \"Such sweet, dear, tempting Devills, Women are\". </p> <p>So it was all their fault, as usual, for making him do it. Rochester's attitudes are hard to take but he tells it as he sees it, and gives access to a world becoming incoherent. As in Jacobean tragedy, sexual licence and cruelty are symptoms of a wider disorder, which he construes philosophically (via Hobbes) as well as sexually, and with an undecorated power which owes more to the verse of Ben Jonson than to his immediate contemporaries. </p> <p>In his most famous poem, \"A Satire on Mankind\", inspired by Juvenal, Rochester attempts to think himself clear of the cast of mind that sought teleological explanations of human conduct and purpose through the application of reason to the alleged mysteries of the cosmos. Man, \"Stumbling from thought to thought, falls headlong down,/ Into doubts boundless Sea, where like to drown/ Books bear him up awhile, and make him try,/ To swim with bladders of philosophy\". There is nothing to discover, he contends, merely the senses to satisfy. </p> <p>Rochester anticipates Augustan balance and epigram here, but the rhetoric serves a rage that - necessarily - lacks an anchor of value and belief. He has nothing to speak on behalf of except himself. His loyalties were to the charming and improvident King, \"who never said a foolish thing/ Nor ever did a wise one\", and his own political interventions in the House of Lords were intermittent at best. He was more inclined to write to his wife than to visit her, leaving her in the clutches of his grimly puritan mother while he got on with drinking, whoring and dying. Although his love for his children was genuine, it too was distant. </p> <p>The poems are correspondingly claustrophobic, their vaunting aristo \"realism\" confined to a world whose possibilities are so shrunken as to make oblivion preferable. The wonderful translation from Seneca's Troas actually seems to draw sustenance from the prospect of nothingness: \"Dead, we become the Lumber of the World/ And to that mass of matter shall be swept,/ Where things destroy'd, with things unborn, are kept\". His abrasive energy is at times reminiscent of Donne, as in the great exercise in paradox, \"Upon Nothing\". In moments such as this we see the poet Rochester might have been: \"Nothing thou elder brother ev'n to Shade/ Thou hadst a being ere the world was made/ And (well fixt) art alone of ending unafraid\". </p> <p>It is unfair to speak ill of the dead, though such considerations would not have stopped Rochester. The late Cephas Goldsworthy QC, who died with this book in the press, has not been well served by his publishers. The Satyr scarcely seems to have been read, never mind edited. It is clearly a labour of love, but it is diffuse and repetitive. It sheds little light on the poems, and with neither index nor illustrations is clearly overpriced. The most interesting passages, guaranteed instructively to darken anybody's day, provide an account of syphilis and of its treatment with hot tubs and mercury in specially adapted whorehouses. The horror of the once-implacable disease is easily matched by the futile pains undergone by sufferers in pursuit of relief, which goes some way to account for Rochester's ire. </p> <p>Rochester provides a hectic portrait of a world whose futile indulgence has much in common with today's celebrity circuit, but the primary force of the poetry is felt at the intersection of talent, fury and the frenzied attempt to make something out of seeming nothingness. And he should appeal to a nation of boozers such as Britain. \"On drinking a Bowl\" might have been written for a falling rock star: \"Cupid and Bacchus, my Saints are,/ May drink, and Love, still reign,/ With Wine, I wash away my cares,/ And then to Cunt again.\" </p> <p>The Deregulated Muse , Sean O'Brien's collection of essays on contemporary poetry, is published by Bloodaxe Books.</p>",

New disciplinary powers to impose interim suspension pending further investigations were invoked during a three-hour emergency meeting in London, which was closed to the public. Professor van Velzen, 52, who is to be dismissed by the Dutch hospital that now employs him, did not appear at the hearing, despite being invited to attend, nor was he represented by a solicitor. The council's five-member interim order committee said the suspension would continue until final decisions were made on charges against Prof van Velzen, although the decision would be reviewed in six months. The GMC's professional conduct committee is expected to consider whether to strike him off as quickly as possible .

Michael Redfern QC, who headed the independent inquiry behind the report, had concluded Prof van Velzen \"must never be allowed to practise again\" after finding he lied when applying for the job of senior pathologist at Alder Hey children's hospital in Liverpool and falsified records and postmortem reports. Prof van Velzen, who may face criminal charges for the way he built up a collection of organs, is facing a trial in Canada over charges of illegally possessing children's and animals' organs. The Medisch Centruuk Haaglanden hospital in the Hague, where Prof van Velzen is now working, has said his contract will be terminated.

      "body": "<p>If only some restaurant conceptualists gave the same amount of thought to their restaurants as they do to their lavatories, eating out would be a vastly more entertaining and enjoyable experience. </p> <p>Tuscan Steak is the second dining experience to be had at American wunder hotel showman Ian Schrager's newish gaff, St Martin's Lane. I reviewed the other, Asia di Cuba, some months back with a mixture of wonderment (at the prices) and pleasure (at the Philippe Starck froufrou folie de th\u00e9tre design and the fact that the food wasn't as bad as I had expected). You might think that I was tempting fate to come back for a second bite at the St Martin's cherry, as it were. Indeed, it was tempting fate. And, do you know, fate just couldn't resist. </p> <p>Back to the lavvies for a moment. I'm not sure about the ladies, but the gents was a pleasure to visit - suave, smooth, soothing to the eye, and seductively utilitarian, a wonderful example of the unity of form and function. The dining room, meanwhile, certainly had the function part sorted, but is sadly lacking in the suave, smooth, soothing and pleasing to the eye business. It had more of the stripped-down sternness of the canteen of one of our more successful architectural practices about it - which, I suppose, makes a kind of sense by way of contrast with the camp froth of Asia di Cuba. </p> <p>The thing about canteens, however, as I understand them, is that the food is subsidised for the benefit of the consumers. Tuscan Steak seems to operate on the opposite principle.

Or should it be two? Or how about one? That is assuming, of course, that one and a half people want to eat the same dish. Which we didn't.

It included salami of that iridescent pink favoured by the Germans, rather than the more natural, darker burgundy of, say, Milanese salami. The soup appeared to have been made with industrial stock. The linguini had that dry, dense, rubbery quality that comes from reheating. The inclusion of anchovies with the prosciutto produced one of the most memorably mismatched combinations that I have ever encountered.

      "bodyText": "If only some restaurant conceptualists gave the same amount of thought to their restaurants as they do to their lavatories, eating out would be a vastly more entertaining and enjoyable experience. Tuscan Steak is the second dining experience to be had at American wunder hotel showman Ian Schrager's newish gaff, St Martin's Lane. I reviewed the other, Asia di Cuba, some months back with a mixture of wonderment (at the prices) and pleasure (at the Philippe Starck froufrou folie de th\u00e9tre design and the fact that the food wasn't as bad as I had expected). You might think that I was tempting fate to come back for a second bite at the St Martin's cherry, as it were. Indeed, it was tempting fate. And, do you know, fate just couldn't resist. Back to the lavvies for a moment. I'm not sure about the ladies, but the gents was a pleasure to visit - suave, smooth, soothing to the eye, and seductively utilitarian, a wonderful example of the unity of form and function. The dining room, meanwhile, certainly had the function part sorted, but is sadly lacking in the suave, smooth, soothing and pleasing to the eye business. It had more of the stripped-down sternness of the canteen of one of our more successful architectural practices about it - which, I suppose, makes a kind of sense by way of contrast with the camp froth of Asia di Cuba. The thing about canteens, however, as I understand them, is that the food is subsidised for the benefit of the consumers. Tuscan Steak seems to operate on the opposite principle. This may be because the workers lunching there that day seemed to have been taken exclusively from the stripped-down, modish Stakhavonites of advertising and associated meejah. Whatever the reason, it was the first time that I, or indeed Porthos, Aramis or Athos - all of whom have degrees with honours in eating - had ever seen steak on the menu at \u00a365 a helping.

      "body": "<p>February is a most encouraging month. The days are lengthening by leaps and bounds and the garden is visibly coming to life. Small bulbs are a major theme. Have we enough of them? If you visit the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) show in Westminster on Tuesday, February 13, you'll be bowled over by the assortment and choice on offer. Shouldn't your garden be joining in the bonanza? </p> <p>It is doubtless full of bare spaces, but they need assessing. First big question: what happens in those spaces during the summer? Shall I be wanting to dig in them, thereby disturbing my bulbs, when they should be allowed tranquillity and the chance to colonise where they are? Are they going to be visually in the way? Daffodils with large leaves become a menace once they have flowered, and will remain an eyesore until June. But the little ones, close to a species such as Narcissus cyclamineus or N. bulbocodium or even our own native Lent lily, N. pseudonarcissus , are no problem. Their leaves are small and narrow enough to be quickly absorbed. </p> <p>But what about those perennials I do not want to disturb for many years at a stretch - eryngiums, for instance, and Japanese anemones? They cry out for inter- or over-planting. I like lightweight narcissi - those that are classified as triandrus hybrids, for example - among my clumps of day lilies (hemerocallis). As the perennials grow up, their own strap leaves totally mask the bulbs. </p> <p>Deciduous shrubs have bare ground around them that is full of light, until their own foliage unfolds. To give the bulbs a little headroom, I may cut some of the lowest branches of Weigela florida 'Florida Variegata', for instance, away. That leaves room for sweet-scented violets, Viola odorata , for the hardy Cyclamen neapolitanum , whose marbled foliage makes such fine patterns from autumn to spring, and for primroses. I especially enjoy pale yellow primroses with the dwarf yellow trumpet daffodil, 'T te-\u00e0-T te'. This is a chunky little number with no pedigree to flaunt, but so cheerful and willing and a great multiplier. It is early, too; the first blooms should be out by now. </p> <p>Beneath rooty trees is a difficult place to colonise. Plants that will tolerate all that dry shade in the summer tend not to be really worth growing, anyway. And they would be a lot happier in the open. But early bulbs, out and growing while there is still moisture and light about, are ideal, especially if you spread an organic mulch over the surface in the autumn - leaf mould, well-rotted bark or mushroom compost (if its alkaline reaction won't upset anything). </p> <p> Crocus tommasinianus , slender and mauve, opening to the sun all this month, is an ideal coloniser as it is such a good self-sower. I consistently fail with winter aconites, Eranthis hyemalis , but many gardeners find them as easy as falling off a log and they make ideal partners under a tree (a beech tree, even) for the crocus. They are also good among hostas. These self- sowers are especially rewarding, as they'll put themselves where you could never plant - right into the crown of a late-developing hosta, such as H. sieboldiana var. elegans , for example. </p> <p>I am grateful to the many cranesbills, the hardy geraniums, that have a rambling habit but die back to a central crown in the autumn, leaving a lot of vacant space around them. In one of these I have a prosperous colony of the February-flowering Iris reticulata . The flowers of that are deep purple, and I thought they'd benefit from being enlivened with a paler, simultaneously flowering bulb, mixed in. So with them I have planted the little snowdrop 'Tiny'. It is a miniature form of the common Galanthus nivalis . I didn't want anything as muscular or competitive as 'Atkinsii' (of which I have a great deal). That would, anyway, have been flowering too early; it is one of the earliest. I have a great drift of it in a damp border that in summer is devoted to rodgersias, Euphorbia palustris and the herbaceous Aralia cachemirica . </p> <p>I am thinking of places for snowdrops all the time. Among the crowns of deciduous ferns is one of the best spots. Any of the male ferns, dryopteris, are good, and even the evergreen shield ferns, polystichum. They do not greatly object to having their fronds cut away in the new year, just as the snowdrops are pushing through. We also plant snowdrops among hydrangeas and among the stems of the suckering shrub, Clerodendrum bungei , which flowers in late summer and autumn but is utterly stark in winter and spring. Another suckering shrub that is a good host for early bulbs is the tree poppy, Romneya coulteri , if you can grow it. I don't know why I am having so much difficulty. When it takes off, it can become quite aggressive, but you can treat it like a herbaceous perennial and cut it right to the ground in winter, leaving the field clear for all sorts of bulbs. </p> <p>Early bulbs with small leaves are great among roses, if you are not neurotic about treating these as a monoculture. The scilla-like, blueand-white Chionodoxa luciliae , a self-sower, entirely filled a bed of HT roses in the garden of friends. They rated it a weed, but it kept coming back; personally, I don't mind that sort of weed at all. Dutch crocuses, at their best next month, love it under and among roses. True, their foliage is a bit of a mess later on, but then the roses are not yet worth looking at themselves. By the time they are, the crocuses will have gone </p>",

      "bodyText": "There is not much left of the once mighty conglomerate Rank. Under the guidance of chief executive Mike Smith, the company has embarked on a radical disposal programme selling its Odeon cinema chain, and its Butlins, Haven, Oasis and Warner holiday camps. Rank would be even slimmer if Mr Smith had found a buyer willing to match the \u00a3473m valuation he put on the video and film processing operation, Deluxe. But in recent days traders have been hearing rumours that Mr Smith is plotting to take the company, which is centred on Mecca bingo and Grosvenor casinos, private. Thanks to his disposal programme, group debt stands at \u00a3300m and the decision to keep Deluxe - the second largest contributor to profits - means Mr Smith has access to predictable cashflows that could be used to support a buyout.",

Once again, we come top of the European pops in all these things. But we've got our downside, too. As I'm not a killjoy, or someone who had a boring teenage and, therefore, envies kids today all these things, I am obviously not complaining about this state of affairs. If you can't smoke, take drugs, drink, eat tasty, fattening food and fornicate when you're young, when can you do it? Things will never slide off you so easily again, like scribbles off a child's Magic Slate; far better a juvenile delinquent than a senile swinger. </p> <p>But I do believe that these statistics are interesting in that they demonstrate the absolutely shameful waste of resources that is government propaganda, which is, of course, funded by the taxpayer. Perhaps some people respond to being bossed around - I was going to say that our German cousins, sadly, spring to mind, but their rate of teenage Aids and heroin addiction is far higher than ours, so there you go. Nobody likes it - but obviously the British aren't one of them. </p> <p>How much has been spent on stating the bleeding obvious by various health departments over the past 30 years? Billions? Trillions? It's obviously not working. Is it ever going to stop? Funny, we're always told that \"throwing money at a problem is never the answer\", but how do successive governments deal with the fact that their ingrate populations seem to be intent on living fast, dying young and having extremely fat corpses? Why, by spending yet another \u00a35m of our money on hiring a bunch of advertising airheads to think up ways to tell us not to drink, smoke or take drugs. </p> <p>Might this government therefore consider a brief moratorium on public health education, as it so obviously isn't working? And might they also consider throwing just a fraction of the money they throw at Touche, Snort &amp; Grabbit Partners at real alternatives to smoking, drinking and hanging around McDonald's? For instance, I know for a fact that teenagers love hanging around swimming pools, both indoor and outdoor. Swimming is a lovely way to keep fit, and you can't smoke, drink or eat while you're doing it. Yet local councils all around the country have, for the past 30 years, been closing down swimming pools and - especially - lidos with a zeal that borders on the obsessive. Brighton &amp; Hove council seems particularly bent on abolishing any rogue patch of water whatsoever, and after years of lidocide have even closed down the huge, glorious paddling pool by the West Pier, where generations of harassed women have kept the kiddies occupied for a blessed hour. This followed close on the heels of the crushing of the artisans' market just the other side of the pier. </p> <p>You can't help thinking that they're part and parcel of the same unholy crusade: to split up the entire Brighton seafront between the three big leisure corporations currently eating the town alive. Anything that doesn't turn a profit for these monsters - be it an artisans' market or a paddling pool - is now closed down as a point of principle. And all the pools, skating rinks and bingo halls - places where people have gone for decades to have good, cheap, healthy fun - end up as bars, restaurants and cinemas, where the good people of these islands can then proceed to eat, drink and goggle themselves into an early grave. </p> <p>In short, just a fraction of the billions that have been spent telling people not to do things could have been better spent providing distractions from eating, drinking, drugging and couch-potatoing. But no - that wouldn't create the right kind of jobs. It would only create jobs for working-class people, providing real, life-enhancing services to other working-class people - rather than jobs in public-health departments and advertising agencies for the thousands of useless graduates who swarm out of the universities every year having been told by the government that any education is good education. </p> <p>It's a long way from healthy eating to concentration camps, but I can't help feeling that Blair's Holocaust Day is a similarly misguided bit of bossiness. I remember finding out about What Happened In Germany when I was 10, through reading about it almost accidentally one summer afternoon in my dad's World At War magazines, and it still remains the most vivid and indelible memory of my whole life. The Holocaust is such a huge, ongoing trauma for the human race, so hard for any of us to understand and live with, that to have just one special day for it, as though it was National Prune Day or Take Your Child To Work Day, seems wildly inappropriate and gimmicky. Some things are best remembered in private. </p> <p>And while we're on the subject, let's remember that Hitler's Germans were an extremely sporty people, who did follow government guidelines on health and efficiency to the letter - proving once and for all what junk that \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\" stuff is. Paradoxically (or do I mean ironically?), it is that very strand of human perversity that says, \"DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO, POLITICIAN\" - be that about eating cheeseburgers or remembering the Shoah - which remains the best guarantee of all that stuff never happening again. Just say no to good advice. You know it makes sense. </p> <p>Just as the Telegraph letters page will invariably soon feature some sweet old buffer who has seen the first crocus of the year, so the Guardian letters page on Tuesday featured the first well-meaning MEP of the year who had just seen his first legalised European brothel and had to share it with the rest of us. Unreconstructed feminist I may be, but whenever I hear any man suggest that prostitution can be anything other than a degrading, soul-destroying blight and should be made more socially acceptable, I have to smile nicely and say, \"And would you like your wife to work as a paid whore, sir? Or your daughter?\" Somehow, they don't see it quite the same way then. Other jobs may be unpleasant, but none of us would really be ashamed to say that one of our loved ones was a drains inspector, undertaker or toilet attendant. I venture that most of us would, however, shrink from revealing at parties that our children or relatives were prostitutes, no matter how clean and legal their brothel. This is because we instinctively realise that prostitution is vile and exploitative. </p> <p>The Swedes, who tend to know a bit about sex, have the right idea; it is a crime to pay for sex anywhere, from anyone - but NOT to sell it. Let's try that instead, shall we? Oh, no - men wouldn't like it.</p>",

I will never forget my first sight of la belle France. As the ferry prepared to dock, Miss Elf gathered her class of 30 around her on the vomit-stained deck and said, \"Mes petits enfants, regardez vous la belle France, la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, de la Continent\". (Or words to that effect, diary. My French is a little rusty, as I rarely have occasion to use it.) </p> <p>We lost precious time in France because Barry Kent tried to leap from the ferry on to the harbour wall before the docking procedure was quite finished. He wasn't in the water long, but by the time the gendarmes had finished their paperwork, a couple of hours had been lost. </p> <p>On the coach, Miss Elf announced that, due to Barry Kent's foolhardy leap, there would now be no time for the planned visit to the war graves cemetery (we were doing a class project on first world war poetry). A few of the more sentimental girls wept, I recall, though Pandora was not among them. \"Instead,\" she said, \"we will sample French bread and French coffee, and we will visit a market and observe the care with which the French choose their fruit and vegetables.\" </p> <p>When I returned home late that night, my mother was waiting for me in the car park of Neil Armstrong comprehensive. As I stepped off the coach, I said to her, \"Maman, I have seen and tasted paradise. You must throw away your Maxwell House and your Mothers Pride thin-sliced and embrace the baguette and caf\u00e9 au lait.\" I can't recall her exact words of reply, but they were said with a snarl. </p> <p>Anyway, diary, what I said to Mohammed was, \"It was your own fault you got stopped by immigration at Dover - you were openly smoking a Disque Bleu fag and you were only 12 years old.\" </p> <p> <b> Sunday, January 28</b> </p> <p> My plan is to take Glenn to Paris for his birthday. It is to be a surprise, so my preparations must be made behind his back. Tonight, I washed and ironed his least gangsterish-looking clothes and hid them in my wardrobe. There is nothing I can do about his hair or the Buffy The Vampire tattoo he's now got on his wrist, but with luck it will be cold and he'll have to roll down his sleeves. I'm looking forward to showing him the Louvre - he's a very lucky boy; I was 26 before I saw that the Mona Lisa wasn't worth the wait in the queue. </p> <p> <b> Tuesday, January 30</b> </p> <p> I was checking and re-checking my travel necessities list tonight. Two Eurostar tickets, travellers' cheques, Nurofen, map of Paris, French/English dictionary, passports, umbrella. There was something missing. Then the realisation hit me like an orange thrown by a toddler in a supermarket trolley: GLENN DOES NOT HAVE A PASSPORT! </p> <p> <b> Wednesday, January 31</b> </p> <p> Pandora has refused to help fast-track a passport for Glenn. I phoned Keith Vaz MP, but there was nobody available to take my call. </p> <p><b> Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years is on BBC1 (not Scotland) on Fridays at 9.30pm. </b></p>",

(Or words to that effect, diary. My French is a little rusty, as I rarely have occasion to use it.) We lost precious time in France because Barry Kent tried to leap from the ferry on to the harbour wall before the docking procedure was quite finished. He wasn't in the water long, but by the time the gendarmes had finished their paperwork, a couple of hours had been lost. On the coach, Miss Elf announced that, due to Barry Kent's foolhardy leap, there would now be no time for the planned visit to the war graves cemetery (we were doing a class project on first world war poetry). A few of the more sentimental girls wept, I recall, though Pandora was not among them. \"Instead,\" she said, \"we will sample French bread and French coffee, and we will visit a market and observe the care with which the French choose their fruit and vegetables.\" When I returned home late that night, my mother was waiting for me in the car park of Neil Armstrong comprehensive. As I stepped off the coach, I said to her, \"Maman, I have seen and tasted paradise. You must throw away your Maxwell House and your Mothers Pride thin-sliced and embrace the baguette and caf\u00e9 au lait.\" I can't recall her exact words of reply, but they were said with a snarl. Anyway, diary, what I said to Mohammed was, \"It was your own fault you got stopped by immigration at Dover - you were openly smoking a Disque Bleu fag and you were only 12 years old.\" Sunday, January 28 My plan is to take Glenn to Paris for his birthday. It is to be a surprise, so my preparations must be made behind his back. Tonight, I washed and ironed his least gangsterish-looking clothes and hid them in my wardrobe. There is nothing I can do about his hair or the Buffy The Vampire tattoo he's now got on his wrist, but with luck it will be cold and he'll have to roll down his sleeves. I'm looking forward to showing him the Louvre - he's a very lucky boy; I was 26 before I saw that the Mona Lisa wasn't worth the wait in the queue. Tuesday, January 30 I was checking and re-checking my travel necessities list tonight. Two Eurostar tickets, travellers' cheques, Nurofen, map of Paris, French/English dictionary, passports, umbrella. There was something missing. Then the realisation hit me like an orange thrown by a toddler in a supermarket trolley: GLENN DOES NOT HAVE A PASSPORT! Wednesday, January 31 Pandora has refused to help fast-track a passport for Glenn. I phoned Keith Vaz MP, but there was nobody available to take my call. Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years is on BBC1 (not Scotland) on Fridays at 9.30pm.",

This is what they trumpeted before Christmas, and I must chide them for it (even though this week features their wines exclusively). It is alcohol that causes hangovers, and though organic wine must be made from grapes that are certified free of artificial fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, any infinitesimal residues of these - which, in my opinion, should be declared on every non-organic wine's label - are unlikely to give any normal brain a bad time unless taken in such horrendous quantities that the amount of alcohol ingested will see you in hell, anyway. Sulphur, which can cause an allergic reaction in asthmatics, is used by winemakers of all persuasions.</p> <p>Overindulgence in La Folie Domaine de Soulie Vin de Pays Monts de la Grage 1997, say, will induce a headache in anyone, for it is a massive 16% of alcohol (reached naturally, of course; there is none of the Bordeaux sugar additions here via the so-called chaptalisation). This is a wine to approach judiciously, then, but not so the food required to rebuff its hearty rusticity. With a savoury vegetable stew, La Folie is a triumph. Carnivores will find all manner of offal dishes appropriate: kidneys, pig's trotters, andouillettes. This huge, aromatic raisiny/liquoricey/herby wine parades figs, cherries, blackcurrants and tannins.

It has sweetness but dryness, liquorice richness and subtle, finely evolved tannins. This is a very interesting C-d-P, and one that would repay cellaring for a few more years to get even classier.</p> <p>Four terrific reds from Catalonia next. Penedes Syrah Col.leccio 1998 (\u00a311.50, 16.5 points) has gorgeous, chewy fruit, stunning texture, great tannins. Penedes Tempranillo Col.leccio 1998 (\u00a310.99, 17 points) is in a similar but richer vein, offering perfect ripeness of fruit and brilliance of tannins. Penedes Cabernet Sauvignon Col.leccio 1998 (\u00a311.25, 17 points) is a wine to make any claret producer gag with delicious disbelief. First, there is tremendous natural alcohol, 14.6%. Second, there are marvellous tannins. Third, which is the sum of these two things, the wine is mouthwateringly balanced and challenging to the mind - all manner of nuances are to be unearthed in this bottle. Reserva Marti 1996 (\u00a315.95, 17 points) is also a wine to set riddles that the enquiring palate will delight in solving.

Sauvignon Blanc Domaine Bassac Vin de Pays des Cotes de Thongue 1999 (\u00a35.15, 16.5 points) has lovely mineral vivacity and tanginess.

      "byline": "Suzie Mackenzie",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Style, Jean Cocteau said, is a simple way of saying something complex. Like art, its essence is effortlessness, no matter how great the effort that goes into its making. There is a modesty at its core that does not seek attention for attention's sake. Maybe this is why so many people who search for style miss it. As if to want it is somehow not to get the point. </p> <p>For 15 years, the German fashion designer Gabriele Strehle has been practising, modestly, quietly, the art of simple style - in her life and in her work. The pretty home that she shares with husband Gerd and daughter Clara is the perfect representation of this aesthetic. It is long, low and unpretentious, decorated with window boxes in spring - indistinguishable from the outside to the other artisanal houses that line N\u00f6rdlingen's canal. Nothing betrays the effort that went into converting the house from essentially a 14th-century medieval cottage into a contemporary home. Inside, the feel is warm, homely, the antithesis of formal. As is Strehle herself, who will greet you in black leggings, big pullover and barefoot. Quiet-spoken yet outspoken. Though shy. \"I have never been good at going out into the world.\" </p> <p>For the first 10 years, her name was not attached to the label she designs, Strenesse. \"No one knew it was me.\" But as she began to become more successful, people would increasingly ask, \"Who is Strenesse?\" And one day, at an international fashion show in Milan, she overheard someone say, Strenesse is a person who stays all the time behind. \"And for me this was the biggest compliment. That I am an identity - consistent, whole, recognisable - but not pushing myself or my name.\" It is this reticence that characterises her clothes. Classic, pure lines, but with a modern informed style that appeals to women such as herself. Women of confidence and authority, who have reached a certain level of sophistication and who have nothing to prove. Fashion has nothing to do with mimicry, Strehle says. It is not a style created by a designer and copied and commercialised. \"It is an expression of what we want to say about ourselves. 'I am at ease.' That is very hard to get right, and why I work so hard at making it perfect. Because if I can do it then women will come back.\" </p> <p>She went into the business straight out of college, having studied not fashion but tailoring - a craft. Always a perfectionist. \"I don't believe you can do anything without first learning how it is done.\" </p> <p>In 1973, she was hired as one of a number of designers by a middle-range utility clothing company in N\u00f6rdlingen, a small, robustly medieval town about an hour's drive north of Munich. The company was selling mainly raincoats to high-street outlets, but Gerd Strehle, who had inherited the factory from his father, wanted to develop something different. \"Something modern, of our time. My father's business had been created after the war, when there was no money, no certainty.\" Within two years, he had given Gabriele her own line. \"I was looking for somebody who could give the company an identity. A particular sort of sensibility that could find a balance between the modern and the classic. And that is Gabriele.\" </p> <p>As the company grew, the Strehles took the decision not to move their headquarters out of the town to, say, Munich, or even Milan, but to stay close to their roots, and to Gerd's family. Though much of the manufacturing has to be done elsewhere, for reasons of production and distribution, all prototypes are produced in the N\u00f6rdlingen factory. They like to think of it, too, as \"family\", which sounds corny until you realise that the only other major industry in N\u00f6rdlingen is tourism, and that Strenesse is the town's biggest employer by far. </p> <p>They also liked the connection with the town's history. In the middle ages, N\u00f6rdlingen was a thriving trade centre, a crossroads at the heart of Europe. Many crafts flourished here. A tanning industry, metal work. There was also a massive brewery. Through its affluence, great burgher houses were built in its centre alongside smaller master craftsman houses - pretty half- timbered buildings. When choosing their own home in 1977, it was one of these that they bought. \"You see that it is not a very rich person's house,\" Gerd says. \"We were poor then.\" But of course everything had to be done perfectly. Walls were stripped out, or pushed back - part of the house abuts the old city wall. Light was let in, but the spaces created were true to the architectural character of the building. Where possible, they kept to original materials: terracotta tiles, wide planed-wood floors. \"If you are false to what you start with then you lose all identity.\" </p> <p>\"The house feels intact,\" Gabriele says, \"like a home.\" Their sort of home. No clutter, not much furniture. A few carefully chosen craft objects. The doors of each room are beautifully carved and painted, medieval doors with ornate iron hinges - a gift from the town in recognition of the employment they have created here. Upstairs, in the gable of the house, is their white sitting room - the carpet pure as freshly fallen snow, on which stands Gerd's ebony-black grand piano. It is only in their young daughter's room that you find any colour. \"I am a person who is very black and white,\" Gabriele says. \"Children have a need to be more eloquent.\" </p> <p>It was having a child, quite late in life - she was 40 when Clara was born - that helped her to develop her philosophy. \"I think both Gerd and I had been, up to that point, totally perfectionist, quite rigid, inflexible at home and at work.\" As their daughter grew up - she is now 10 - they recognised that things had to change. Clara needed her own space. \"It's interesting with children. You see they need structure, but they also need freedom. Not complete freedom, but they have to have the two. But how to get this balance right is very difficult.\" </p> <p>So Clara changed their personal life, but in many ways their working life also. \"I remembered how my mother had brought us up: with clear lines to follow but in a very open way. We were expected to be correct with people, straight. Ego was discouraged. But our opinions were always our own. She educated us by bringing out our character.\" </p> <p>You can adapt this philosophy to anything, she says - home, life, clothes. \"Again you see it with children. How they dress is an expression of themselves as individuals and as part of a group. They are following in one way and they are separate in another. Their security comes with the expression of both. Now I take this as the basis of everything I do.\" </p> <p>Security is a word she uses often. Clothes, she says, should give a sense of \"personal security\", not in the sense of being something you conceal yourself beneath. \"Some labels do this, I know. They give identification, not identity, But this is not my sensibility.\" In the same way, home is security - somewhere you retreat to to be yourself. \"Where whatever you do, you do it with feeling. When you cook, you cook with passion. Otherwise there is no pleasure.\" </p> <p>She feels that time has caught up with her ideas. \"This is a good time for me.\" The 80s were a strange period. Superficial, flamboyant. \"But that cool, gourmet style - all presentation - gave way to something more natural.\" The influence of the Japanese aesthetic was important here. In Japan, as she says, everything is aestheticised. There is distance, discretion, a certain sparseness combined with a delicacy. \"It is via Asia that we found our way back to something more natural, traditional.\" That is their art of living. Perfection. Whereas hers, as she says, has moved on. \"Has become imperfectly perfect.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Gabriele Strehle's clothes are available at Harrods and Selfridges.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Style, Jean Cocteau said, is a simple way of saying something complex. Like art, its essence is effortlessness, no matter how great the effort that goes into its making. There is a modesty at its core that does not seek attention for attention's sake. Maybe this is why so many people who search for style miss it. As if to want it is somehow not to get the point. For 15 years, the German fashion designer Gabriele Strehle has been practising, modestly, quietly, the art of simple style - in her life and in her work. The pretty home that she shares with husband Gerd and daughter Clara is the perfect representation of this aesthetic. It is long, low and unpretentious, decorated with window boxes in spring - indistinguishable from the outside to the other artisanal houses that line N\u00f6rdlingen's canal. Nothing betrays the effort that went into converting the house from essentially a 14th-century medieval cottage into a contemporary home. Inside, the feel is warm, homely, the antithesis of formal. As is Strehle herself, who will greet you in black leggings, big pullover and barefoot. Quiet-spoken yet outspoken. Though shy. \"I have never been good at going out into the world.\" For the first 10 years, her name was not attached to the label she designs, Strenesse. \"No one knew it was me.\" But as she began to become more successful, people would increasingly ask, \"Who is Strenesse?\" And one day, at an international fashion show in Milan, she overheard someone say, Strenesse is a person who stays all the time behind. \"And for me this was the biggest compliment. That I am an identity - consistent, whole, recognisable - but not pushing myself or my name.\" It is this reticence that characterises her clothes. Classic, pure lines, but with a modern informed style that appeals to women such as herself. Women of confidence and authority, who have reached a certain level of sophistication and who have nothing to prove. Fashion has nothing to do with mimicry, Strehle says. It is not a style created by a designer and copied and commercialised. \"It is an expression of what we want to say about ourselves. 'I am at ease.' That is very hard to get right, and why I work so hard at making it perfect. Because if I can do it then women will come back.\" She went into the business straight out of college, having studied not fashion but tailoring - a craft. Always a perfectionist. \"I don't believe you can do anything without first learning how it is done.\" In 1973, she was hired as one of a number of designers by a middle-range utility clothing company in N\u00f6rdlingen, a small, robustly medieval town about an hour's drive north of Munich. The company was selling mainly raincoats to high-street outlets, but Gerd Strehle, who had inherited the factory from his father, wanted to develop something different. \"Something modern, of our time. My father's business had been created after the war, when there was no money, no certainty.\" Within two years, he had given Gabriele her own line. \"I was looking for somebody who could give the company an identity. A particular sort of sensibility that could find a balance between the modern and the classic. And that is Gabriele.\" As the company grew, the Strehles took the decision not to move their headquarters out of the town to, say, Munich, or even Milan, but to stay close to their roots, and to Gerd's family. Though much of the manufacturing has to be done elsewhere, for reasons of production and distribution, all prototypes are produced in the N\u00f6rdlingen factory. They like to think of it, too, as \"family\", which sounds corny until you realise that the only other major industry in N\u00f6rdlingen is tourism, and that Strenesse is the town's biggest employer by far. They also liked the connection with the town's history. In the middle ages, N\u00f6rdlingen was a thriving trade centre, a crossroads at the heart of Europe. Many crafts flourished here. A tanning industry, metal work. There was also a massive brewery. Through its affluence, great burgher houses were built in its centre alongside smaller master craftsman houses - pretty half- timbered buildings. When choosing their own home in 1977, it was one of these that they bought. \"You see that it is not a very rich person's house,\" Gerd says. \"We were poor then.\" But of course everything had to be done perfectly. Walls were stripped out, or pushed back - part of the house abuts the old city wall. Light was let in, but the spaces created were true to the architectural character of the building. Where possible, they kept to original materials: terracotta tiles, wide planed-wood floors. \"If you are false to what you start with then you lose all identity.\" \"The house feels intact,\" Gabriele says, \"like a home.\" Their sort of home. No clutter, not much furniture. A few carefully chosen craft objects. The doors of each room are beautifully carved and painted, medieval doors with ornate iron hinges - a gift from the town in recognition of the employment they have created here. Upstairs, in the gable of the house, is their white sitting room - the carpet pure as freshly fallen snow, on which stands Gerd's ebony-black grand piano. It is only in their young daughter's room that you find any colour. \"I am a person who is very black and white,\" Gabriele says. \"Children have a need to be more eloquent.\" It was having a child, quite late in life - she was 40 when Clara was born - that helped her to develop her philosophy. \"I think both Gerd and I had been, up to that point, totally perfectionist, quite rigid, inflexible at home and at work.\" As their daughter grew up - she is now 10 - they recognised that things had to change. Clara needed her own space. \"It's interesting with children. You see they need structure, but they also need freedom. Not complete freedom, but they have to have the two. But how to get this balance right is very difficult.\" So Clara changed their personal life, but in many ways their working life also. \"I remembered how my mother had brought us up: with clear lines to follow but in a very open way. We were expected to be correct with people, straight. Ego was discouraged. But our opinions were always our own. She educated us by bringing out our character.\" You can adapt this philosophy to anything, she says - home, life, clothes. \"Again you see it with children. How they dress is an expression of themselves as individuals and as part of a group. They are following in one way and they are separate in another. Their security comes with the expression of both. Now I take this as the basis of everything I do.\" Security is a word she uses often. Clothes, she says, should give a sense of \"personal security\", not in the sense of being something you conceal yourself beneath. \"Some labels do this, I know. They give identification, not identity, But this is not my sensibility.\" In the same way, home is security - somewhere you retreat to to be yourself. \"Where whatever you do, you do it with feeling. When you cook, you cook with passion. Otherwise there is no pleasure.\" She feels that time has caught up with her ideas. \"This is a good time for me.\" The 80s were a strange period. Superficial, flamboyant. \"But that cool, gourmet style - all presentation - gave way to something more natural.\" The influence of the Japanese aesthetic was important here. In Japan, as she says, everything is aestheticised. There is distance, discretion, a certain sparseness combined with a delicacy. \"It is via Asia that we found our way back to something more natural, traditional.\" That is their art of living. Perfection. Whereas hers, as she says, has moved on. \"Has become imperfectly perfect.\" \u0095 Gabriele Strehle's clothes are available at Harrods and Selfridges.",

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 1945, a skinny, dark-haired 16-year-old boy is walking along 172nd Street in The Bronx. He's carrying an unwieldy Graflex camera given to him by his father as a birthday present two years before. So as not to alert potential subjects, this self- possessed teenager has taken the precaution of concealing the camera in a paper shopping bag, with the top open and a hole for the lens; this way he can shoot incognito. On the corner of Grand Concourse and 172nd, he spots an unfolding drama. A news vendor bends over a banner headline announcing the death of President Roosevelt. Quickly the boy raises his bag, frames the shot, focuses, and presses the shutter. For the first time, Stanley Kubrick has sensed a collective feeling and captured it in a single image. What's more, the next day he sells that image to a leading US magazine, Look. </p> <p>Kubrick had visited the Look offices previously, but had been turned away because the editor's assistant thought he was a messenger. But that spring day in 1945, the Look editor, Lucy O'Brian, bought not only the Roosevelt picture, but all the other ones he brought with him. From then on, at an age when other boys were still at school - when he was still at school - the young Stanley covered more than 100 photo-stories for Look, the photo-monthly based in New York. He was allowed a remarkable degree of independence: often, he wasn't allotted a subject but chose his own stories. He travelled from one end of the country to the other on a huge range of assignments: light-hearted candid camerawork on juvenile dating habits, pseudo science projects such as How We Look To Monkeys, photo-reportage on an orphanage outside Chicago or a circus during a winter layoff in Sarasota, Florida, and an intimate photo-journal of the young Montgomery Clift living in Manhattan. Twenty years later, Kubrick said, \"It was an invaluable experience. It taught me how things work in the real world.\" </p> <p>It was also a way of operating that never left him. \"Just as a cop always carries a gun, Stanley always made sure he had a camera on set,\" says Kubrick's first producer, James B Harris. Which gives an insight into how some of the most effective images of 20th-century cinema were created. Whether or not we've seen the movies, Kubrick has etched into our collective psyche the nymphet Lolita in her heart-shaped sunglasses, 2001's light-suffused spaceman, and Alex, the Clockwork Orange droog, with his jaunty bowler and single mascara'd eye. What makes these images indelible is that, although they all come from motion pictures, they are also emphatically static, frozen in time - for before Stanley Kubrick became a master of movies, he was first one of America's leading photographers. </p> <p>Garrett Brown, best known as the inventor of the Steadicam camera that is now an indispensable part of any film shoot, worked with Kubrick on The Shining in 1978. It was, according to Kubrick's biographer Michael Herr, \"a technological marriage made in heaven\". Throughout the shoot, while Jack Nicholson hacked his way through doors and Shelley Duvall took repeated re-takes, Brown and Kubrick had endless conversations about the pursuit of what they called \"the elusiveness of perfection\". \"What is important about Stanley is that his images were all his alone,\" recalls Brown, who now lives in Philadelphia. \"All of us cameramen learn the rules of composition: the golden mean, the rule of thirds, and so on. Stanley had no time for that. That wasn't even in his universe. He made frames that were centred, but they were his own and, because they weren't orthodox compositions, that is one of the reasons why they are so powerful.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, since they were one-off shots produced for a magazine, Kubrick's early photo-journalism has, until now, very rarely been seen. But a German professor and Kubrick enthusiast, Rainer Crone, has curated an exhibition of the Look pictures which is currently on show in Edinburgh. He sees a direct link between Stanley's teenage work and his later career. \"What Kubrick tried to do in his own unconventional way was to create a moving picture through his stills camera,\" says Crone. \"Although he was very young, he did something entirely new in photography. He wasn't a social photographer like Walker Evans and he didn't try to catch the right moment like Cartier-Bresson. He told a story, but then he stopped it, he suspended it with his camera, and that's why I have called the show Still Moving Pictures.\" </p> <p>Kubrick's own story began in The Bronx. His father was a doctor and hoped his son would follow in his footsteps. By Bronx standards, the family was prosperous. \"They lived in a house,\" exclaims Kubrick's oldest living friend, Alexander Singer. \"I didn't know anybody who lived in a house. We all lived in apartments.\" </p> <p>Singer, now a robust 74-year-old, who has been living in California for more than 40 years, went to William Howard Taft High School with Kubrick. There, they both joined the photographic club. Stanley had been taught about photography from an early age by his father, and had another advantage over his friend: \"It was almost unimaginable for kids like me,\" says Singer, \"but Stanley had a darkroom at home. It took me a while to figure out how important this experience would be for him later on, when he became a master of light on a film set.\" </p> <p>Kubrick also very soon became adept at pushing film to high speeds to exploit natural available light. He needed that edge because at the age of 17 he was competing with New York veterans. \"The combination of his youth, technical skill and storytelling ability so early on was unbearable for photographers up to four times his age,\" says Singer. \"Stanley had an omnivorous appetite for every form of learning, but neither of us had much appetite for the rigidity and narrowness of the learning at Taft.\" </p> <p>Instead, both boys paid regular visits to the cinema at the Museum of Modern Art, where Kubrick watched the entire collection - twice. His favourite film was Eisenstein's rousing hymn to Russian statehood, Alexander Nevsky. Aside from closely studying Eisenstein's imagery and use of montage, Singer says, \"Stanley never got over the Prokofiev score for the battle on the ice in that movie. He bought a record of it and played it over and over until his kid sister couldn't stand it and broke it over his head.\" </p> <p>Contrasting his obsession with film and his truancy from school, Kubrick admitted in later years that his schooldays were dominated by fear - \"fear of failing grades, fear of not staying with your class\" - but he added, \"Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.\" Working for Look was at the very least a training. What such news-photo magazines wanted during the late 40s and 50s was not so much portraits or single shots, but photo essays; and, as Crone points out, \"Even then, there was a sense of unfolding drama in his pictures. In effect, he was learning how to direct his camera rather than merely taking a snapshot.\" Garrett Brown recalls: \"What interested Stanley was the moment of freezing motion... In one sense a still photograph is a motion that has stopped. You freeze nature for that moment.\" </p> <p>Kubrick's pictures began to look more and more like movie stills. In between his assignments, he composed his own stories, which looked as though they were real, had just happened to take place at that moment. In A Short Movie In A Movie Balcony, for example, a young couple appear to have just met in a cinema - but, Singer reveals, \"That was set up. The boy was a friend of Stanley's from school and he cast the girl from another class.\" </p> <p>And it wasn't just casting - which Kubrick would later say was \"75% of a movie\" - he also showed his determination to get the best possible performances out of his subjects by first telling the boy, \"to make a move on the girl\", then, without letting on, telling the girl, \"When he goes too far, let him have it.\" </p> <p>\"He caught the slap low down with an infra-red flash,\" says Singer. \"That kind of on-the-nose, direct, simple storytelling really paid off for Stanley, because those pictures had a structure. You wanted to know, 'What's going to happen next?'\" </p> <p>Singer, who would go with Kubrick to Hollywood in 1956 and later become a movie director himself, believes, \"That little story has the essential quality of his films: the appearance of honesty, which is carefully arranged, the framing of the picture so that it has the authenticity of photo-journalism, and the lighting, which looks as though it comes from natural, available sources but which actually came from a flash. All of those techniques fell naturally to his hand. For all practical purposes, Stanley was fully formed at 17. The changes were a matter of degree.\" </p> <p>With his continued absence from school, Kubrick gave up any chance of going to college. Not that he cared. He already had a career. He already knew what a mass audience wanted, and he had the means of giving it to them. By 1949, his pal Singer was working as an office boy for the March Of Time documentary news series - which was put out before the main feature in movie theatres. Why didn't Stanley contribute a little film to that, Singer suggested. After all, the money was good. But what to film? </p> <p>Kubrick turned to his most ambitious piece of photo-journalism, Prizefighter, a seven-page spread - a sequence of 19 shots - he had done for Look about a day in the life of middleweight boxer Walter Cartier. For his eight-minute film, Kubrick cut almost immediately to the end of that day, to the fight. Even so, the film is still a joined-up version of the photo-story. Both share stark overhead neon lighting, which concentrates on the combatants, leaving everything outside the ring in semi-darkness. Both the still and moving versions have figures in the foreground to pull you into the picture. And both feature the low-angle shot that would become a Kubrick signature - although, in fact, the angle was forced on Kubrick by the weight of his Graflex (nearly 4kg), which dictated a shooting position seldom higher than the waist and more often almost on the floor. </p> <p>Kubrick was later to boast that he did everything on this little film, including cleaning up afterwards, but he was actually helped by his old buddy, Singer, who worked as a general assistant. \"It took eight weeks,\" says Singer. \"We re-did and re-did everything. He took as much care with that movie as he did with 2001. He pulled out all the stops, and was learning very rapidly and applying everything that he had learned from his Look days - lighting, staging, positioning the camera. There was a visual acuity, a mind-eye connection that was already first-rate. I was looking over his shoulder, which, even then, I felt was a privileged position.\" </p> <p>Kubrick sold Day Of The Fight for a mere $100 profit. He went on to make five short movies, including two fiction films, over the next three years. But it wasn't until 1954 when he met James B Harris - through Singer - and secured more solid financing for his films that his directorial career began to take off. Singer had himself been tempted to \"buffalo\" Harris into one of his own \"idiot projects\", but he gracefully stood aside for his lifelong friend. Returning the favour, Kubrick gave Singer an entr\u00e9e into Hollywood the next year as associate producer on his first truly successful movie, The Killing. Singer, however, believes that any debt had actually been paid off by Kubrick five years earlier, \"when he took my wedding photographs\". </p> <p>The introduction was the start of a promising partnership. Beginning with The Killing, through Paths Of Glory, Spartacus and Lolita, and ending with Dr Strangelove in 1964,Jimmy Harris would produce some of Kubrick's greatest movies. Nowadays, likeSinger, Harris lives in Los Angeles and is also a director. Indeed, back in 1965, it was Kubrick who helped Harris in his move away from production into direction. </p> <p>By then a veteran director, Kubrick offered all sorts of suggestions to his erstwhile producer but, nearly four decades later, Harris remembers only one particular piece of advice: \"It was a war film,\" he says. \"I needed to do some research, and I didn't know what sort of camera would be best for taking black-and-white pictures on board an American destroyer. 'A 10 D,' Stanley fired back. 'It shoots half frames. It's made by Olympus.'\" </p> <p>\u0095 Stanley Kubrick: Still Moving Pictures, Photographs 1945-1950, is at Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, until April 1.</p>",

From then on, at an age when other boys were still at school - when he was still at school - the young Stanley covered more than 100 photo-stories for Look, the photo-monthly based in New York. He was allowed a remarkable degree of independence: often, he wasn't allotted a subject but chose his own stories. He travelled from one end of the country to the other on a huge range of assignments: light-hearted candid camerawork on juvenile dating habits, pseudo science projects such as How We Look To Monkeys, photo-reportage on an orphanage outside Chicago or a circus during a winter layoff in Sarasota, Florida, and an intimate photo-journal of the young Montgomery Clift living in Manhattan. Twenty years later, Kubrick said, \"It was an invaluable experience. It taught me how things work in the real world.\" It was also a way of operating that never left him. \"Just as a cop always carries a gun, Stanley always made sure he had a camera on set,\" says Kubrick's first producer, James B Harris. Which gives an insight into how some of the most effective images of 20th-century cinema were created. Whether or not we've seen the movies, Kubrick has etched into our collective psyche the nymphet Lolita in her heart-shaped sunglasses, 2001's light-suffused spaceman, and Alex, the Clockwork Orange droog, with his jaunty bowler and single mascara'd eye. What makes these images indelible is that, although they all come from motion pictures, they are also emphatically static, frozen in time - for before Stanley Kubrick became a master of movies, he was first one of America's leading photographers. Garrett Brown, best known as the inventor of the Steadicam camera that is now an indispensable part of any film shoot, worked with Kubrick on The Shining in 1978. It was, according to Kubrick's biographer Michael Herr, \"a technological marriage made in heaven\". Throughout the shoot, while Jack Nicholson hacked his way through doors and Shelley Duvall took repeated re-takes, Brown and Kubrick had endless conversations about the pursuit of what they called \"the elusiveness of perfection\". \"What is important about Stanley is that his images were all his alone,\" recalls Brown, who now lives in Philadelphia. \"All of us cameramen learn the rules of composition: the golden mean, the rule of thirds, and so on. Stanley had no time for that. That wasn't even in his universe. He made frames that were centred, but they were his own and, because they weren't orthodox compositions, that is one of the reasons why they are so powerful.\" Unsurprisingly, since they were one-off shots produced for a magazine, Kubrick's early photo-journalism has, until now, very rarely been seen. But a German professor and Kubrick enthusiast, Rainer Crone, has curated an exhibition of the Look pictures which is currently on show in Edinburgh. He sees a direct link between Stanley's teenage work and his later career. \"What Kubrick tried to do in his own unconventional way was to create a moving picture through his stills camera,\" says Crone. \"Although he was very young, he did something entirely new in photography. He wasn't a social photographer like Walker Evans and he didn't try to catch the right moment like Cartier-Bresson. He told a story, but then he stopped it, he suspended it with his camera, and that's why I have called the show Still Moving Pictures.\" Kubrick's own story began in The Bronx. His father was a doctor and hoped his son would follow in his footsteps. By Bronx standards, the family was prosperous. \"They lived in a house,\" exclaims Kubrick's oldest living friend, Alexander Singer. \"I didn't know anybody who lived in a house. We all lived in apartments.\" Singer, now a robust 74-year-old, who has been living in California for more than 40 years, went to William Howard Taft High School with Kubrick. There, they both joined the photographic club. Stanley had been taught about photography from an early age by his father, and had another advantage over his friend: \"It was almost unimaginable for kids like me,\" says Singer, \"but Stanley had a darkroom at home. It took me a while to figure out how important this experience would be for him later on, when he became a master of light on a film set.\" Kubrick also very soon became adept at pushing film to high speeds to exploit natural available light. He needed that edge because at the age of 17 he was competing with New York veterans. \"The combination of his youth, technical skill and storytelling ability so early on was unbearable for photographers up to four times his age,\" says Singer. \"Stanley had an omnivorous appetite for every form of learning, but neither of us had much appetite for the rigidity and narrowness of the learning at Taft.\" Instead, both boys paid regular visits to the cinema at the Museum of Modern Art, where Kubrick watched the entire collection - twice. His favourite film was Eisenstein's rousing hymn to Russian statehood, Alexander Nevsky. Aside from closely studying Eisenstein's imagery and use of montage, Singer says, \"Stanley never got over the Prokofiev score for the battle on the ice in that movie. He bought a record of it and played it over and over until his kid sister couldn't stand it and broke it over his head.\" Contrasting his obsession with film and his truancy from school, Kubrick admitted in later years that his schooldays were dominated by fear - \"fear of failing grades, fear of not staying with your class\" - but he added, \"Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.\" Working for Look was at the very least a training. What such news-photo magazines wanted during the late 40s and 50s was not so much portraits or single shots, but photo essays; and, as Crone points out, \"Even then, there was a sense of unfolding drama in his pictures. In effect, he was learning how to direct his camera rather than merely taking a snapshot.\" Garrett Brown recalls: \"What interested Stanley was the moment of freezing motion... In one sense a still photograph is a motion that has stopped. You freeze nature for that moment.\" Kubrick's pictures began to look more and more like movie stills. In between his assignments, he composed his own stories, which looked as though they were real, had just happened to take place at that moment. In A Short Movie In A Movie Balcony, for example, a young couple appear to have just met in a cinema - but, Singer reveals, \"That was set up. The boy was a friend of Stanley's from school and he cast the girl from another class.\" And it wasn't just casting - which Kubrick would later say was \"75% of a movie\" - he also showed his determination to get the best possible performances out of his subjects by first telling the boy, \"to make a move on the girl\", then, without letting on, telling the girl, \"When he goes too far, let him have it.\" \"He caught the slap low down with an infra-red flash,\" says Singer. \"That kind of on-the-nose, direct, simple storytelling really paid off for Stanley, because those pictures had a structure. You wanted to know, 'What's going to happen next?'\" Singer, who would go with Kubrick to Hollywood in 1956 and later become a movie director himself, believes, \"That little story has the essential quality of his films: the appearance of honesty, which is carefully arranged, the framing of the picture so that it has the authenticity of photo-journalism, and the lighting, which looks as though it comes from natural, available sources but which actually came from a flash. All of those techniques fell naturally to his hand. For all practical purposes, Stanley was fully formed at 17. The changes were a matter of degree.\" With his continued absence from school, Kubrick gave up any chance of going to college. Not that he cared. He already had a career. He already knew what a mass audience wanted, and he had the means of giving it to them. By 1949, his pal Singer was working as an office boy for the March Of Time documentary news series - which was put out before the main feature in movie theatres. Why didn't Stanley contribute a little film to that, Singer suggested. After all, the money was good. But what to film? Kubrick turned to his most ambitious piece of photo-journalism, Prizefighter, a seven-page spread - a sequence of 19 shots - he had done for Look about a day in the life of middleweight boxer Walter Cartier. For his eight-minute film, Kubrick cut almost immediately to the end of that day, to the fight. Even so, the film is still a joined-up version of the photo-story. Both share stark overhead neon lighting, which concentrates on the combatants, leaving everything outside the ring in semi-darkness. Both the still and moving versions have figures in the foreground to pull you into the picture. And both feature the low-angle shot that would become a Kubrick signature - although, in fact, the angle was forced on Kubrick by the weight of his Graflex (nearly 4kg), which dictated a shooting position seldom higher than the waist and more often almost on the floor. Kubrick was later to boast that he did everything on this little film, including cleaning up afterwards, but he was actually helped by his old buddy, Singer, who worked as a general assistant. \"It took eight weeks,\" says Singer. \"We re-did and re-did everything. He took as much care with that movie as he did with 2001. He pulled out all the stops, and was learning very rapidly and applying everything that he had learned from his Look days - lighting, staging, positioning the camera. There was a visual acuity, a mind-eye connection that was already first-rate. I was looking over his shoulder, which, even then, I felt was a privileged position.\" Kubrick sold Day Of The Fight for a mere $100 profit. He went on to make five short movies, including two fiction films, over the next three years. But it wasn't until 1954 when he met James B Harris - through Singer - and secured more solid financing for his films that his directorial career began to take off. Singer had himself been tempted to \"buffalo\" Harris into one of his own \"idiot projects\", but he gracefully stood aside for his lifelong friend. Returning the favour, Kubrick gave Singer an entr\u00e9e into Hollywood the next year as associate producer on his first truly successful movie, The Killing. Singer, however, believes that any debt had actually been paid off by Kubrick five years earlier, \"when he took my wedding photographs\". The introduction was the start of a promising partnership. Beginning with The Killing, through Paths Of Glory, Spartacus and Lolita, and ending with Dr Strangelove in 1964,Jimmy Harris would produce some of Kubrick's greatest movies. Nowadays, likeSinger, Harris lives in Los Angeles and is also a director. Indeed, back in 1965, it was Kubrick who helped Harris in his move away from production into direction. By then a veteran director, Kubrick offered all sorts of suggestions to his erstwhile producer but, nearly four decades later, Harris remembers only one particular piece of advice: \"It was a war film,\" he says. \"I needed to do some research, and I didn't know what sort of camera would be best for taking black-and-white pictures on board an American destroyer. 'A 10 D,' Stanley fired back. 'It shoots half frames. It's made by Olympus.'\" \u0095 Stanley Kubrick: Still Moving Pictures, Photographs 1945-1950, is at Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, until April 1.",

      "body": "<p>A quarter of a century ago, Liv Ullmann wrote a haunting autobiography called Changing. The great Norwegian actress had recently parted from the great Swedish film-maker Ingmar Bergman, and she could feel middle age encroaching. She wanted to embrace it, but was drowning in her fears - was she a bad mother, had she sacrificed her daughter's well-being to her own ambition, what would happen when her breasts started to sag, when she was no longer a desirable commodity? The only constant she could see in the future was Bergman. Although they had separated, although there was no prospect of reconciliation, in one way or another she knew that she and Bergman would never be apart. \"I was right - we never did leave each other,\" she says today. \"You know, soon after we met, Ingmar told me he had a dream that we would be painfully connected.\" </p> <p>We are sitting in a suite in a swanky Los Angeles hotel. It's such a strange place to meet her. Ullmann, the dour, heartbreaking actress who peeled off layer after layer until she revealed her raw, bleeding soul. If Bergman was the master of human misery, she was the canvas on which he painted. And here we are in LA, the home of have-a-nice-day fatuity, where the object of ageing is to remain unchanged, and the object of talking is not to communicate. If Bergman and Ullmann had a motto, it would probably be \"Have a bad day\". </p> <p>Ullmann is now 62, Bergman 82. Both have continued to evolve in the 25 years since she wrote Changing. Ullmann no longer acts and is now an established director in her own right. Bergman no longer directs (his last film, Fanny &amp; Alexander, won four Oscars in 1982) and is more reclusive than ever. Perhaps the relationship has been turned on its head. Ullmann has just directed Bergman's autobiographical screenplay, Faithless. But she has not just dutifully realised his vision. Instead, she has taken it, shaken it, rewritten it and created a film that might well turn out to be their greatest collaboration. </p> <p>Most of today's fans of Hollywood blockbusters will not have heard of either of them. Indeed, many of Bergman's fans presume that he is dead. But in the 60s and early 70s, they were one of the world's most celebrated couples. She was his muse, his star, his love. He was her inspiration, her director, her love. This was the golden age of European cinema. Godard and Truffaut in France, Bu\u00f1uel in Spain, Fassbinder in Germany, Antonioni in Italy, Tarkovsky in the Soviet Union and, of course, Bergman in Sweden. The golden age of cinema full stop. And Bergman was at the peak of his powers with a string of angst-soaked classics to his name - Wild Strawberries, The Virgin Spring, The Seventh Seal. </p> <p>Those were the days when films were taken seriously. And no one's films were more serious than Bergman's. It was cinema as psychoanalysis. His movies didn't have plots, as such, let alone special effects. Yet they were gripping. They were stripped to the essence - long, brutally cropped close-ups of characters talking and talking about love and hate, guilt and God, hope and despair. Bergman showed, more powerfully than any film-maker, how people tear each other apart in the name of love. Somehow, he showed cinema at both its most humane and at its cruellest. And Ullmann, with her complex, ever-changing face, was his ideal actress - chaste, frigid, hungry, sensual, lumpen, elegant, tormented, beatific Ullmann. She had an extraordinary knack of showing contrary emotions at any one time. In Cries And Whispers, she orgasms through tears of anguish after her husband announces that he is leaving her; in Autumn Sonata, she plays a quiet, kindly daughter whose bitterness rages behind her selfless love. </p> <p>Within seconds of meeting Ullmann, you realise why she was so pivotal to Bergman. She can't do small talk. She says that her head is so full of stuff these days that she is selective with her memories, and suddenly she's talking about how images define memory, and how smell is one of the strongest images, and how she's spent a lifetime trying to recapture the smell of childhood security. \"My grandmother's neck smelled of safety. She was my best friend, and I used to sit on her lap when I was a little girl, and she'd tell me all these wonderful stories, and she always said the stones and the trees talked to us. If I fell asleep I would have this wonderful smell in her neck, and I would always search for this smell.\" </p> <p>What was the smell? \"Maybe just being old, but in a good way. Being old in a safe way. Being human, being understandable.\" For a while, she thought Bergman smelled of her grandmother, but... \"he took the safety out of the smell, so it didn't smell like her any more.\" Years later, she discovered the smell again - on an old woman dying of leprosy whom she met while visiting refugees in Macau. </p> <p>Ullmann was born in Tokyo to Norwegian parents. Childhood was blessed with securities, but ruptured by loss and fear. By the close of the second world war, both her father and grandfather had been killed. \"My grandfather died in Dachau, but we are not Jewish. He was sent there because he had helped Jewish people escape from the town where he lived in Norway. Then they took 10 hostages instead, and he died there... the same time as his son, more or less.\" </p> <p>How did her father die? \"I was six, and we had been in Japan, then we went to Toronto, where there were many British and Norwegian pilots, and my father was a civil engineer. According to my mother, my father walked into the propeller of a plane. I didn't think you could survive that, but apparently he did for a year and then he died.\" </p> <p>She tells her war stories dispassionately, as if she's talking about people she doesn't know. You sense she doesn't want to exploit a false emotion. Does she remember her father? \"I only remember that he held my hand.\" </p> <p>Ullmann grew up in a house of women - mother, grandmother, older sister. She was always an unwieldy mix: strong and fearful, oppressed and free-spirit. As a young girl, she deliberately scalded her foot so she could miss her hated cookery lesson at school. Between 11 and 15, when she was left alone at home in the evening, she would sleep in the bath with the door locked until her mother or sister returned. She says that she still longs for the bathroom and then corrects herself: \"Not the bathroom, but for that tiny little space that is mine.\" Childhood was also the time of her greatest happiness. She talks about the times she would lift herself on to the handlebars and do a handstand on her bicycle, and says that she has never felt so liberated. </p> <p>Ullmann is tired. She's just flown into LA, and she massages her head, irons out the creases. As she talks about how her Lutheran faith has strengthened over the years, a shadow passes behind me. \"The man behind you, oh I think he's left again, he's Jewish.\" Who is he? \"He's my husband. We divorced, but we are living together.\" She says it so matter of factly that I laugh. They got back together as soon as they divorced? \"Yeah. I always seem to keep friends with the people after.\" Donald is from Boston, in his mid-60s and is big in property. </p> <p>She says the split with Donald was initially acrimonious. \"He divorced me, and I hoped I'd never see him again. But then I went on my plane back to Norway and he came on the plane and he said that no one else shall sit at your side. He came all the way to Norway and then took the plane back. I thought that was really romantic - I fall for those things very easily.\" So they got back together. They married in 1985 and divorced four years ago. \"It was when I did Private Confessions.\" Private Confessions was the first Bergman script she directed. </p> <p>When she first met Bergman, she was married to a psychiatrist and already an established actress in her 20s. Bergman cast her in Persona (1966), opposite Bibi Andersson, as an actress having a breakdown, tormented into silence. Andersson, who had had an affair with Bergman, warned her against the film-maker. Bergman was a serial star-fucker, who seemed to sleep with his actresses as a matter of course. He was nearing 50, had been married four times and had seven children. Ullmann and Bergman duly fell in love. She left her husband, moved in with him and they had a daughter, Linn. </p> <p>The most revealing film Ullmann starred in is Scenes From A Marriage, made in 1973, a few years after they split up. Both of them denied that this devastating account of a break-up was autobiographical, but it's hard to believe. Ullmann is Marianne, the repressed, diffident wife of a scientist, played by Bergman regular Erland Josephson, who leaves her for another woman. At the beginning of the film, the couple, being interviewed, are asked to describe themselves. The husband says that he is successful, clever, quite brilliant actually, moral, decent, popular, responsible, considerate and an absolute wow in bed. Marianne struggles to think of anything to say. Eventually, she manages, \"I am a mother.\" As so often with Bergman, it is an unsparing study of the neurotic loneliness of women and the savage egotism of men. </p> <p>Faithless could easily be called Scenes From A Marriage 2. Again, it's about the collapse of a relationship. Again, the leading woman, brilliantly played by Lena Endre, is called Marianne. But the wheel has turned. While Ullmann directs, Bergman is now the barely fictionalised character, David Bergman (played by Josephson), looking back on his life as a film-maker, lover and home-wrecker. Like much of Bergman's work, it is also about the nature of art. Faithless tells the story of a film-maker trying to recapture the pain of his old love so that he can exploit it; so he can turn it into the movie we are watching. Ullmann has a lighter touch than Bergman - somehow, there's more humour to the tears - but she directs with all his spartan vigour. It's an astonishing achievement to make such relentless misery so compelling. </p> <p>Do people expect her to be a misery-guts when they meet her? \"Yes, always. But I am not miserable. At times, I can be sad, but I love to play, I love to laugh.\" She pauses, mulling something over. \"I think I make people nervous at times.\" She tells me how the photographer Annie Leibovitz recently came to her Miami home and was unnerved by the way Ullmann looked her in the eye and listened to her so attentively. She left without a picture. </p> <p>Perhaps her strength has been a weakness? She nods enthusiastically. \"Oh, it is. All women know that we have to underplay strength at times, because men don't always like it.\" She says that she grew up at the same time as women's liberation, and her generation had two choices: \"To be the way our mothers brought us up to be - you know, pleasant, nice - or to be who we wanted to be. My choice was to be pleasant and nice.\" </p> <p>Did she downplay her success with Bergman? \"No. Yes . A little. I would say to him, 'With other directors, I think of what you would have said to me', and sometimes I'd say that and it wasn't true, because I like working with a lot of directors.\" </p> <p>It must have been tricky, when his success was so dependent on hers. \"No, it wasn't... well, it was intertwined. Maybe he could have found somebody, maybe they wouldn't have been as gifted as I was then as an actress, but the chances are not so big. I know I couldn't have found a better director. But now I'm already into that Ingmar thing, that [deferring to] man thing, saying, 'I could not have been what I am without him'. If you've done that all your life, it's very difficult to get away from it.\" </p> <p>Actually, she says, it's only with Faithless that she has overcome all that. \"I managed to say, for the first time in my life, that I'm very proud of this film, I think I know how to do this, I think I'm professional. I've never said these things, and now I'm saying it a lot. Now, it's almost natural.\" And it feels good? \"Oh, it feels fantastic.\" </p> <p>Next day, we meet up in Palm Springs, where Ullmann is receiving the International Film-Makers Award. Palm Springs is 100 or so miles from Los Angeles. Hollywood stars retire here to play golf. Plastic surgery is compulsory. Ullmann is interviewed on stage before Faithless is screened. She is wearing a little black dress, a fabulous, multicoloured coat and looks beautiful; huge, blue eyes; soft, heavy lips; a smile both seductive and maternal. She makes no attempt to disguise her lined skin. </p> <p>She appears so confident as she reveals how Bergman wrote the story of Faithless as a monologue and how she had to sculpt the characters out of that. \"Ingmar didn't want anything to do with it. He didn't see it for two years until it was finished. He expected to see a rough cut, but I know he's very controlling, so when he did see it, I said, 'Sorry, this is the movie.' \" One of her most important additions is the daughter, who becomes the emotional fulcrum of the movie. \"That was not in Ingmar's script, and he really liked it - he said, 'Oh, why didn't I think of that?' But now he's forgotten that, because now he feels he thought of it.\" </p> <p>In Scenes From A Marriage, we never saw Marianne's children. It was as if they didn't exist. And, for much of Bergman's life, his children haven't. He used to say, almost boast, that he didn't know the ages of his children, that he measured the years by his movies, not by his offspring. </p> <p>The on-stage interviewer tells the audience that Faithless is \"best described as 'not a date movie'\". Ullmann is unhappy with that. \"I disagree. It is a date movie - it teaches you about relationships.\" She says that, nowadays, in our godless world, few people believe in the sanctity of relationships because the core values aren't there.\" </p> <p>She talks about why she became a director: \"I was tired of working for bad directors. And, the older you get, the more bad directors you work for.\" Someone asks how big an influence Bergman is on her directing style. \"I'm not so conscious of him, but everyone else is,\" she says. \"If I have a man and a woman, they'll say it is inspired by Bergman and forget that everyone has a man and a woman.\" Directing is so much more fulfilling than acting, she says, because you get to be yourself and talk about what's important for you. And what is important for her is to make films about real people, unremarkable people, older people. \"I'm 62, and I started when I was 18. There's so much shame about age these days, and I don't know why.\" The applauserises in a crescendo. </p> <p>Ullmann tells the storyline of a short film she made a few years ago. \"An old man is lying in a big double bed by himself. He wakes up all alone, has a bath, goes into the kitchen, makes a picnic basket, puts his hat on, looks in the mirror and leaves. He walks through the streets and he's old and little and nobody notices him because he's just... old. He goes to the hospital, walks through the corridor, and no one notices. He enters the room, and then finally he smiles because she's there. His wife has lost her mind. He gives her the soup he has made for her, waters the flowers, kisses her, and leaves. No one sees him leave. He walks back down the corridor and through the streets unnoticed. But we know he is the carrier of love. That is the kind of film I want to make.\" </p> <p>Later, I suggest to her that the story about the old man seems to illustrate a crucial difference between her and Bergman. If Bergman had made the movie, the old man would have visited his senile wife and they would have torn each other apart. She laughs, and says he would find it sentimental. </p> <p>Did she never want to give Bergman a good slap and tell him to cheer up? \"No, I've never hit anyone. Not my child, not a man. I banged on somebody's chest, that's the closest. I have been hit, but I've never hit. I can get very angry, but I can't stay with anger. There is no one I can hate for ever. Ingmar is good at that.\" </p> <p>There must have been times when she was dragged down by his bleakness? \"I thought so at the time - five years on that miserable dark island, I thought I was dragged down, but I wasn't in a prison. I could have left, and I didn't. But we did quarrel a lot.\" What about? \"Everything. When we lived together, later when we made movies, and we have our disagreements now. Yes, I get very angry at him.\" She has always said that what makes it worse is that she sees so many of her own traits in him. \"I get angry when he tries to control me. He's very controlling. I'm probably controlling myself, but I don't recognise it so well in me.\" </p> <p>How could it not be a controlling relationship when for so much of their life together he doubled as her director? \"When he controls, he says this is how it is and there is no discussion.\" She says that she is more democratic. I smile as she talks, and suddenly she changes tack. \"He's a good listener, too. Things don't avoid him. Then he gets one of those little smiles that you have now, and you'd know the danger was coming. You'd see that smile and think, 'Oh my God, I should have never said that.'\" I tell her that Bergman sounds like an abuser. \"He uses strong language, but he's not abusive. He makes the law and he lives by it.\" </p> <p>Ullmann and Bergman lived together for five short and long years on Faro, his remote Baltic island . They never married, and when they separated in the early 70s, Bergman kept Ullmann's dog, Pett, and Ullmann kept their daughter, Linn. It was while making Cries And Whispers with Ullmann that Bergman began an affair with Ingrid von Rosen, who later became his wife and remained so until she died in 1995. </p> <p>Ullmann decided to escape the frozen darkness of the Scandinavian climate and Bergman's vision. She went to Hollywood, where she was sold as the new Ingrid Bergman. And she certainly gave it a go, most notably in 40 Carats, a romantic comedy somewhere between Shirley Valentine and The Graduate. But Hollywood never really took to her - Scandinavian melancholy was no longer considered exotic in Tinseltown, just morose. For a short time, she was entranced by the sun, the heated pools and Henry Kissinger. But she also worried. She was shy, she was made to feel stupid by Kissinger, she wondered whether she should be out on the town when she had a young daughter. She says that she only saw Kissinger socially because he did all the talking and made her feel less self-conscious. \"I absolutely disapprove of what he did politically, and I told him so, but he tells good stories. He just thought it was fun to be with me because I don't understand anything, because I'm stupid in politics and I'm on the wrong side.\" </p> <p>Does she consider herself political? \"Yes, living is political. The choices you make, the people you condone or do not condone. What you want to do with your life, how you want to connect with other people, how you want to use the time you're living here.\" What makes her most angry today, she says, is the way wealthy countries abuse asylum seekers. For many years she has been a Unicef ambassador. She tells me about a boy she fostered who had lost his parents in the bloodshed of Sierra Leone's civil war. \"He hated everybody when he came, especially me, because he had never had anybody. Now he is the most wonderful generous person - he calls me Mummy.\" </p> <p>Ullmann says people were so generous to her that it was only when she got home that she realised what a fiasco Hollywood had been. She achieved great success on Broadway, as Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House, but even then the roots lay in Norway. Over the years, she has made Nora, that trapped butterfly of a housewife who finally breaks free, her own. She still feels Norway in her bones. \"We are surrounded by mountains, we want to come out of it, we want to explore, we are not sophisticated, but we are more natural. We celebrate the light summers and shudder in the cold, dark winters.\" Where does she live now? \"I don't know.\" She has a home in Norway, lives in America with Donald, and spent two and a half years making Faithless in Sweden. </p> <p>I suggest that now Bergman no longer directs, he has entrusted his eyes to Ullmann. She looks sceptical. \" Well, in that case he has changed his tune. He's just come out in an interview and said film-making is whorish work and film-makers are whores. To say that because it's something he no longer wants to do or can do is shit .\" </p> <p>Have the men in her life been jealous of Bergman? \"Maybe, but none of them has said so. They may have been...\" </p> <p>I ask Donald why he got on the plane after divorcing her. \"Because I love her. I was never going to leave her, I was just changing the balance of the relationship. I don't think most marriages that continue are as honest and as clear as they pretend to be.\" </p> <p>\"That's his word, you know,\" Ullmann says. \"I think if you marry once, and you keep it, to stand in front of God and be together in sickdom and health, I think that is wonderful. I wish I had experienced it.\" </p> <p>Next day, Ullmann is smiling and chatty. The waiter comes over. She orders coffee and he her asks for her number. \"My phone number?\" She giggles flirtatiously. He giggles ecstatically: \"You're trying to make me a happy man, aren't you?\" </p> <p>She talks about Linn, who is now 35, and her 10-year-old boy, Ullmann's grandson, with such tender pride. In Changing, she wrote that when Linn grew up she wanted to be a trapeze artist. Did she succeed? \"No, she didn't. Well, she did in a way. She's a writer, she's a trapeze artist. Her writing is full of fantasy and images. Incredible.\" </p> <p>For so many years Ullmann considered herself a bad mother. \"Yes, I felt very guilty. When I look back now, I'm not guilty any more. I gave as much as I had in me, and could do. I failed, but who doesn't fail? And I didn't hit and I didn't deceive.\" She says she has grown up, that even Bergman has grown up into a better parent. Nowadays, most of his children visit him in summer on Faro. \"They live in different houses and they see him when he shows movies and he comes and has coffee with them. Now I think they are a wonderful source of life for him.\" </p> <p>She's been thinking about Changing, and changing, and the importance of optimism. \"Optimism wins out in the end. If you don't seek happiness, it is going to be a really sad life and it doesn't mean you have to be Polyanna. You know Polyanna? It doesn't mean you should smile at everything.\" </p> <p>Is that the main difference between her and Bergman? She says it's not so simple: \"I think he is, to a certain degree, optimistic in life, but he doesn't put it into his movies. And of course that has really helped him, because, in spite of them being pessimistic, looking very cold and unforgiving, he has also touched people. And he has won. He is looked upon as one of the best cinema people in the world. Probably if it had been more life-affirming, it wouldn't have been so complimented.\" She says it's a pity that he's not made more comedies, that even now no one makes her laugh like Bergman. </p> <p>It turned out that she had not attended the festival gala dinner the evening before, where she could have done her own bit of basking in glory. \"I don't know what to say to the people, I don't know this kind of conversation, I get panicked, I really get so panicked, dancing or anything.\" Maybe that is one of the great changes in Ullmann's life. It's not that she has overcome her fears, it's that she does everything she can to manage them. Ten years ago, she stopped drinking because she was worried that she drank to overcome social fears. The better solution was simply not to go to the events she didn't want to. </p> <p>She says that there have been so many uncomfortable silent nights in her life. Recently, she and Donald were invited to Clinton's farewell dinner. She put her fear to one side because she really wanted to meet him. \"Suddenly, I was placed beside Clinton and I couldn't say a word. I was 18 and I was terrified, and there were so many things I wanted to say to him.\" </p> <p>Then there was the night with Woody Allen and Bergman.\"I was doing A Doll's House a long time ago on Broadway and Woody Allen was kind of courting me, probably to get to know Ingmar . Then Ingmar came to New York to see me in A Doll's House. He stayed in a hotel with Ingrid, whom he had just married. I told him Woody Allen wanted to meet him. Ingmar wanted to meet him, and he said come to my suite and we will have dinner. Then Woody Allen came to get me and he was so excited, he was shivering and talking, talking. Anyway, Ingmar opened the door and said welcome. That's all he said. And the two of them looked at each other. Two geniuses met. We sat down at the table - and this is the honest to God truth, Ingrid was sitting there, I was sitting there, Ingmar there, and Woody Allen there - and they did not talk. They just looked at each other, almost lovingly.</p> <p> Ingrid, for once, was allowed to talk at the table, so she talked to me about meatballs. We talked about meatballs because I didn't know what to talk about. And in the middle of the thing she gave me my child support in an envelope and said this is for Linn next year. It was a little embarrassing in front of Woody Allen. So she did that and I hated her a little more. And the two of them would look at each other and smile, look at these two sweet women. I hated that - that I was only a meatball person - and probably she hated that, too. They never talked. They never talked. They laughed to each other but never said a word. Then it was over and they said goodbye . On the way home Woody Allen said, 'Thank you. He is an incredible man.' I couldn't believe it. Then, when I came home, Ingmar called, 'Thank you, Liv, what an incredible meeting.'\" </p> <p>These days, she would not so easily be patronised as a daffy little woman. When she was a young success, more militant feminists attacked her as a conservative. \"It was because I was pleasing. They were maybe right, but they are more pleasing now than I am.\" She is less pleasing than she used to be? \"Yes, I strive to be. I used to say, poor little me, I'm not strong. But I am strong.\" She laughs at the idea that she thought she'd reached her sell-by date in her mid-30s. Now, there's so much to look forward to. \"I want to be available... maybe for my grandson, for living, for whatever...\" Would she ever have plastic surgery? \"Never. Never did. Never will.\" Why not? \"Because I want to see what I was meant to be, what my face is meant to be.\" </p> <p>Donald joins us. They look happy together. Did she think things would work out okay when she started out? \"Yes, but in a different way. I thought my mother would praise me and my men would praise me, and my daughter would praise me, and they don't necessarily praise me. But I praise myself. I'm not big in my head, and I don't feel terrible about myself, and I'm not a drunk, and I've not burnt out, and I have feelings, and I feel very young inside. I think I'm a very okay person, and that's the best thing I've done in life.\" </p> <p>Ullmann tells me of the last time she saw Bergman. Yes, of course, they fought and disagreed, but they also realised that they had reached an understanding. \"We have found what real love is. It's respect, trust, admiration. It's everything except sex. But, you know, even that is there, the fondness, wanting to hug, wanting to hold hands. The last time I saw him he followed me down to my hotel in Stockholm. It was very late and I really wanted to go because I'd been sitting in his flat for a long time. And he said I'll follow you home and I said no, you don't have to. Then suddenly it was a wonderful, wonderful walk. We didn't say much. We went by a church where his father had been a preacher and it wasn't so much what he said, and it wasn't sex at all, but it was the same intimacy as sex, the way we were walking that night. And he was moved and I was moved because we hadn't been walking in the street in the dark alone for 30 years since we'd been lovers.\" </p> <p>Liv, Ingmar and Donald: it could be one of Bergman's films but, of course, in the movies things never turn out as well as in real life </p> <p>\u0095 Faithless is released on February 9.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A quarter of a century ago, Liv Ullmann wrote a haunting autobiography called Changing. The great Norwegian actress had recently parted from the great Swedish film-maker Ingmar Bergman, and she could feel middle age encroaching. She wanted to embrace it, but was drowning in her fears - was she a bad mother, had she sacrificed her daughter's well-being to her own ambition, what would happen when her breasts started to sag, when she was no longer a desirable commodity? The only constant she could see in the future was Bergman. Although they had separated, although there was no prospect of reconciliation, in one way or another she knew that she and Bergman would never be apart. \"I was right - we never did leave each other,\" she says today. \"You know, soon after we met, Ingmar told me he had a dream that we would be painfully connected.\" We are sitting in a suite in a swanky Los Angeles hotel. It's such a strange place to meet her. Ullmann, the dour, heartbreaking actress who peeled off layer after layer until she revealed her raw, bleeding soul. If Bergman was the master of human misery, she was the canvas on which he painted. And here we are in LA, the home of have-a-nice-day fatuity, where the object of ageing is to remain unchanged, and the object of talking is not to communicate. If Bergman and Ullmann had a motto, it would probably be \"Have a bad day\". Ullmann is now 62, Bergman 82. Both have continued to evolve in the 25 years since she wrote Changing. Ullmann no longer acts and is now an established director in her own right. Bergman no longer directs (his last film, Fanny &amp; Alexander, won four Oscars in 1982) and is more reclusive than ever. Perhaps the relationship has been turned on its head. Ullmann has just directed Bergman's autobiographical screenplay, Faithless. But she has not just dutifully realised his vision. Instead, she has taken it, shaken it, rewritten it and created a film that might well turn out to be their greatest collaboration. Most of today's fans of Hollywood blockbusters will not have heard of either of them. Indeed, many of Bergman's fans presume that he is dead. But in the 60s and early 70s, they were one of the world's most celebrated couples. She was his muse, his star, his love. He was her inspiration, her director, her love. This was the golden age of European cinema. Godard and Truffaut in France, Bu\u00f1uel in Spain, Fassbinder in Germany, Antonioni in Italy, Tarkovsky in the Soviet Union and, of course, Bergman in Sweden. The golden age of cinema full stop. And Bergman was at the peak of his powers with a string of angst-soaked classics to his name - Wild Strawberries, The Virgin Spring, The Seventh Seal. Those were the days when films were taken seriously. And no one's films were more serious than Bergman's. It was cinema as psychoanalysis. His movies didn't have plots, as such, let alone special effects. Yet they were gripping. They were stripped to the essence - long, brutally cropped close-ups of characters talking and talking about love and hate, guilt and God, hope and despair. Bergman showed, more powerfully than any film-maker, how people tear each other apart in the name of love. Somehow, he showed cinema at both its most humane and at its cruellest. And Ullmann, with her complex, ever-changing face, was his ideal actress - chaste, frigid, hungry, sensual, lumpen, elegant, tormented, beatific Ullmann. She had an extraordinary knack of showing contrary emotions at any one time. In Cries And Whispers, she orgasms through tears of anguish after her husband announces that he is leaving her; in Autumn Sonata, she plays a quiet, kindly daughter whose bitterness rages behind her selfless love. Within seconds of meeting Ullmann, you realise why she was so pivotal to Bergman. She can't do small talk. She says that her head is so full of stuff these days that she is selective with her memories, and suddenly she's talking about how images define memory, and how smell is one of the strongest images, and how she's spent a lifetime trying to recapture the smell of childhood security. \"My grandmother's neck smelled of safety. She was my best friend, and I used to sit on her lap when I was a little girl, and she'd tell me all these wonderful stories, and she always said the stones and the trees talked to us. If I fell asleep I would have this wonderful smell in her neck, and I would always search for this smell.\" What was the smell? \"Maybe just being old, but in a good way. Being old in a safe way. Being human, being understandable.\" For a while, she thought Bergman smelled of her grandmother, but... \"he took the safety out of the smell, so it didn't smell like her any more.\" Years later, she discovered the smell again - on an old woman dying of leprosy whom she met while visiting refugees in Macau. Ullmann was born in Tokyo to Norwegian parents. Childhood was blessed with securities, but ruptured by loss and fear. By the close of the second world war, both her father and grandfather had been killed. \"My grandfather died in Dachau, but we are not Jewish. He was sent there because he had helped Jewish people escape from the town where he lived in Norway. Then they took 10 hostages instead, and he died there... the same time as his son, more or less.\" How did her father die? \"I was six, and we had been in Japan, then we went to Toronto, where there were many British and Norwegian pilots, and my father was a civil engineer. According to my mother, my father walked into the propeller of a plane. I didn't think you could survive that, but apparently he did for a year and then he died.\" She tells her war stories dispassionately, as if she's talking about people she doesn't know. You sense she doesn't want to exploit a false emotion. Does she remember her father? \"I only remember that he held my hand.\" Ullmann grew up in a house of women - mother, grandmother, older sister. She was always an unwieldy mix: strong and fearful, oppressed and free-spirit. As a young girl, she deliberately scalded her foot so she could miss her hated cookery lesson at school. Between 11 and 15, when she was left alone at home in the evening, she would sleep in the bath with the door locked until her mother or sister returned. She says that she still longs for the bathroom and then corrects herself: \"Not the bathroom, but for that tiny little space that is mine.\" Childhood was also the time of her greatest happiness. She talks about the times she would lift herself on to the handlebars and do a handstand on her bicycle, and says that she has never felt so liberated. Ullmann is tired. She's just flown into LA, and she massages her head, irons out the creases. As she talks about how her Lutheran faith has strengthened over the years, a shadow passes behind me. \"The man behind you, oh I think he's left again, he's Jewish.\" Who is he? \"He's my husband. We divorced, but we are living together.\" She says it so matter of factly that I laugh. They got back together as soon as they divorced? \"Yeah. I always seem to keep friends with the people after.\" Donald is from Boston, in his mid-60s and is big in property. She says the split with Donald was initially acrimonious. \"He divorced me, and I hoped I'd never see him again. But then I went on my plane back to Norway and he came on the plane and he said that no one else shall sit at your side. He came all the way to Norway and then took the plane back. I thought that was really romantic - I fall for those things very easily.\" So they got back together. They married in 1985 and divorced four years ago. \"It was when I did Private Confessions.\" Private Confessions was the first Bergman script she directed. When she first met Bergman, she was married to a psychiatrist and already an established actress in her 20s. Bergman cast her in Persona (1966), opposite Bibi Andersson, as an actress having a breakdown, tormented into silence. Andersson, who had had an affair with Bergman, warned her against the film-maker. Bergman was a serial star-fucker, who seemed to sleep with his actresses as a matter of course. He was nearing 50, had been married four times and had seven children. Ullmann and Bergman duly fell in love. She left her husband, moved in with him and they had a daughter, Linn. The most revealing film Ullmann starred in is Scenes From A Marriage, made in 1973, a few years after they split up. Both of them denied that this devastating account of a break-up was autobiographical, but it's hard to believe. Ullmann is Marianne, the repressed, diffident wife of a scientist, played by Bergman regular Erland Josephson, who leaves her for another woman. At the beginning of the film, the couple, being interviewed, are asked to describe themselves. The husband says that he is successful, clever, quite brilliant actually, moral, decent, popular, responsible, considerate and an absolute wow in bed. Marianne struggles to think of anything to say. Eventually, she manages, \"I am a mother.\" As so often with Bergman, it is an unsparing study of the neurotic loneliness of women and the savage egotism of men. Faithless could easily be called Scenes From A Marriage 2. Again, it's about the collapse of a relationship. Again, the leading woman, brilliantly played by Lena Endre, is called Marianne. But the wheel has turned. While Ullmann directs, Bergman is now the barely fictionalised character, David Bergman (played by Josephson), looking back on his life as a film-maker, lover and home-wrecker. Like much of Bergman's work, it is also about the nature of art. Faithless tells the story of a film-maker trying to recapture the pain of his old love so that he can exploit it; so he can turn it into the movie we are watching. Ullmann has a lighter touch than Bergman - somehow, there's more humour to the tears - but she directs with all his spartan vigour. It's an astonishing achievement to make such relentless misery so compelling. Do people expect her to be a misery-guts when they meet her? \"Yes, always. But I am not miserable. At times, I can be sad, but I love to play, I love to laugh.\" She pauses, mulling something over. \"I think I make people nervous at times.\" She tells me how the photographer Annie Leibovitz recently came to her Miami home and was unnerved by the way Ullmann looked her in the eye and listened to her so attentively. She left without a picture. Perhaps her strength has been a weakness? She nods enthusiastically. \"Oh, it is. All women know that we have to underplay strength at times, because men don't always like it.\" She says that she grew up at the same time as women's liberation, and her generation had two choices: \"To be the way our mothers brought us up to be - you know, pleasant, nice - or to be who we wanted to be. My choice was to be pleasant and nice.\" Did she downplay her success with Bergman? \"No. Yes . A little. I would say to him, 'With other directors, I think of what you would have said to me', and sometimes I'd say that and it wasn't true, because I like working with a lot of directors.\" It must have been tricky, when his success was so dependent on hers. \"No, it wasn't... well, it was intertwined. Maybe he could have found somebody, maybe they wouldn't have been as gifted as I was then as an actress, but the chances are not so big. I know I couldn't have found a better director. But now I'm already into that Ingmar thing, that [deferring to] man thing, saying, 'I could not have been what I am without him'. If you've done that all your life, it's very difficult to get away from it.\" Actually, she says, it's only with Faithless that she has overcome all that. \"I managed to say, for the first time in my life, that I'm very proud of this film, I think I know how to do this, I think I'm professional. I've never said these things, and now I'm saying it a lot. Now, it's almost natural.\" And it feels good? \"Oh, it feels fantastic.\" Next day, we meet up in Palm Springs, where Ullmann is receiving the International Film-Makers Award. Palm Springs is 100 or so miles from Los Angeles. Hollywood stars retire here to play golf. Plastic surgery is compulsory. Ullmann is interviewed on stage before Faithless is screened. She is wearing a little black dress, a fabulous, multicoloured coat and looks beautiful; huge, blue eyes; soft, heavy lips; a smile both seductive and maternal. She makes no attempt to disguise her lined skin. She appears so confident as she reveals how Bergman wrote the story of Faithless as a monologue and how she had to sculpt the characters out of that. \"Ingmar didn't want anything to do with it. He didn't see it for two years until it was finished. He expected to see a rough cut, but I know he's very controlling, so when he did see it, I said, 'Sorry, this is the movie.' \" One of her most important additions is the daughter, who becomes the emotional fulcrum of the movie. \"That was not in Ingmar's script, and he really liked it - he said, 'Oh, why didn't I think of that?' But now he's forgotten that, because now he feels he thought of it.\" In Scenes From A Marriage, we never saw Marianne's children. It was as if they didn't exist. And, for much of Bergman's life, his children haven't. He used to say, almost boast, that he didn't know the ages of his children, that he measured the years by his movies, not by his offspring. The on-stage interviewer tells the audience that Faithless is \"best described as 'not a date movie'\". Ullmann is unhappy with that. \"I disagree. It is a date movie - it teaches you about relationships.\" She says that, nowadays, in our godless world, few people believe in the sanctity of relationships because the core values aren't there.\" She talks about why she became a director: \"I was tired of working for bad directors. And, the older you get, the more bad directors you work for.\" Someone asks how big an influence Bergman is on her directing style. \"I'm not so conscious of him, but everyone else is,\" she says. \"If I have a man and a woman, they'll say it is inspired by Bergman and forget that everyone has a man and a woman.\" Directing is so much more fulfilling than acting, she says, because you get to be yourself and talk about what's important for you. And what is important for her is to make films about real people, unremarkable people, older people. \"I'm 62, and I started when I was 18. There's so much shame about age these days, and I don't know why.\" The applauserises in a crescendo. Ullmann tells the storyline of a short film she made a few years ago. \"An old man is lying in a big double bed by himself. He wakes up all alone, has a bath, goes into the kitchen, makes a picnic basket, puts his hat on, looks in the mirror and leaves. He walks through the streets and he's old and little and nobody notices him because he's just... old. He goes to the hospital, walks through the corridor, and no one notices. He enters the room, and then finally he smiles because she's there. His wife has lost her mind. He gives her the soup he has made for her, waters the flowers, kisses her, and leaves. No one sees him leave. He walks back down the corridor and through the streets unnoticed. But we know he is the carrier of love. That is the kind of film I want to make.\" Later, I suggest to her that the story about the old man seems to illustrate a crucial difference between her and Bergman. If Bergman had made the movie, the old man would have visited his senile wife and they would have torn each other apart. She laughs, and says he would find it sentimental. Did she never want to give Bergman a good slap and tell him to cheer up? \"No, I've never hit anyone. Not my child, not a man. I banged on somebody's chest, that's the closest. I have been hit, but I've never hit. I can get very angry, but I can't stay with anger. There is no one I can hate for ever. Ingmar is good at that.\" There must have been times when she was dragged down by his bleakness? \"I thought so at the time - five years on that miserable dark island, I thought I was dragged down, but I wasn't in a prison. I could have left, and I didn't. But we did quarrel a lot.\" What about? \"Everything. When we lived together, later when we made movies, and we have our disagreements now. Yes, I get very angry at him.\" She has always said that what makes it worse is that she sees so many of her own traits in him. \"I get angry when he tries to control me. He's very controlling. I'm probably controlling myself, but I don't recognise it so well in me.\" How could it not be a controlling relationship when for so much of their life together he doubled as her director? \"When he controls, he says this is how it is and there is no discussion.\" She says that she is more democratic. I smile as she talks, and suddenly she changes tack. \"He's a good listener, too. Things don't avoid him. Then he gets one of those little smiles that you have now, and you'd know the danger was coming. You'd see that smile and think, 'Oh my God, I should have never said that.'\" I tell her that Bergman sounds like an abuser. \"He uses strong language, but he's not abusive. He makes the law and he lives by it.\" Ullmann and Bergman lived together for five short and long years on Faro, his remote Baltic island . They never married, and when they separated in the early 70s, Bergman kept Ullmann's dog, Pett, and Ullmann kept their daughter, Linn. It was while making Cries And Whispers with Ullmann that Bergman began an affair with Ingrid von Rosen, who later became his wife and remained so until she died in 1995. Ullmann decided to escape the frozen darkness of the Scandinavian climate and Bergman's vision. She went to Hollywood, where she was sold as the new Ingrid Bergman. And she certainly gave it a go, most notably in 40 Carats, a romantic comedy somewhere between Shirley Valentine and The Graduate. But Hollywood never really took to her - Scandinavian melancholy was no longer considered exotic in Tinseltown, just morose. For a short time, she was entranced by the sun, the heated pools and Henry Kissinger. But she also worried. She was shy, she was made to feel stupid by Kissinger, she wondered whether she should be out on the town when she had a young daughter. She says that she only saw Kissinger socially because he did all the talking and made her feel less self-conscious. \"I absolutely disapprove of what he did politically, and I told him so, but he tells good stories. He just thought it was fun to be with me because I don't understand anything, because I'm stupid in politics and I'm on the wrong side.\" Does she consider herself political? \"Yes, living is political. The choices you make, the people you condone or do not condone. What you want to do with your life, how you want to connect with other people, how you want to use the time you're living here.\" What makes her most angry today, she says, is the way wealthy countries abuse asylum seekers. For many years she has been a Unicef ambassador. She tells me about a boy she fostered who had lost his parents in the bloodshed of Sierra Leone's civil war. \"He hated everybody when he came, especially me, because he had never had anybody. Now he is the most wonderful generous person - he calls me Mummy.\" Ullmann says people were so generous to her that it was only when she got home that she realised what a fiasco Hollywood had been. She achieved great success on Broadway, as Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House, but even then the roots lay in Norway. Over the years, she has made Nora, that trapped butterfly of a housewife who finally breaks free, her own. She still feels Norway in her bones. \"We are surrounded by mountains, we want to come out of it, we want to explore, we are not sophisticated, but we are more natural. We celebrate the light summers and shudder in the cold, dark winters.\" Where does she live now? \"I don't know.\" She has a home in Norway, lives in America with Donald, and spent two and a half years making Faithless in Sweden. I suggest that now Bergman no longer directs, he has entrusted his eyes to Ullmann. She looks sceptical. \" Well, in that case he has changed his tune. He's just come out in an interview and said film-making is whorish work and film-makers are whores. To say that because it's something he no longer wants to do or can do is shit .\" Have the men in her life been jealous of Bergman? \"Maybe, but none of them has said so. They may have been...\" I ask Donald why he got on the plane after divorcing her. \"Because I love her. I was never going to leave her, I was just changing the balance of the relationship. I don't think most marriages that continue are as honest and as clear as they pretend to be.\" \"That's his word, you know,\" Ullmann says. \"I think if you marry once, and you keep it, to stand in front of God and be together in sickdom and health, I think that is wonderful. I wish I had experienced it.\" Next day, Ullmann is smiling and chatty. The waiter comes over. She orders coffee and he her asks for her number. \"My phone number?\" She giggles flirtatiously. He giggles ecstatically: \"You're trying to make me a happy man, aren't you?\" She talks about Linn, who is now 35, and her 10-year-old boy, Ullmann's grandson, with such tender pride. In Changing, she wrote that when Linn grew up she wanted to be a trapeze artist. Did she succeed? \"No, she didn't. Well, she did in a way. She's a writer, she's a trapeze artist. Her writing is full of fantasy and images. Incredible.\" For so many years Ullmann considered herself a bad mother. \"Yes, I felt very guilty. When I look back now, I'm not guilty any more. I gave as much as I had in me, and could do. I failed, but who doesn't fail? And I didn't hit and I didn't deceive.\" She says she has grown up, that even Bergman has grown up into a better parent. Nowadays, most of his children visit him in summer on Faro. \"They live in different houses and they see him when he shows movies and he comes and has coffee with them. Now I think they are a wonderful source of life for him.\" She's been thinking about Changing, and changing, and the importance of optimism. \"Optimism wins out in the end. If you don't seek happiness, it is going to be a really sad life and it doesn't mean you have to be Polyanna. You know Polyanna? It doesn't mean you should smile at everything.\" Is that the main difference between her and Bergman? She says it's not so simple: \"I think he is, to a certain degree, optimistic in life, but he doesn't put it into his movies. And of course that has really helped him, because, in spite of them being pessimistic, looking very cold and unforgiving, he has also touched people. And he has won. He is looked upon as one of the best cinema people in the world. Probably if it had been more life-affirming, it wouldn't have been so complimented.\" She says it's a pity that he's not made more comedies, that even now no one makes her laugh like Bergman. It turned out that she had not attended the festival gala dinner the evening before, where she could have done her own bit of basking in glory. \"I don't know what to say to the people, I don't know this kind of conversation, I get panicked, I really get so panicked, dancing or anything.\" Maybe that is one of the great changes in Ullmann's life. It's not that she has overcome her fears, it's that she does everything she can to manage them. Ten years ago, she stopped drinking because she was worried that she drank to overcome social fears. The better solution was simply not to go to the events she didn't want to. She says that there have been so many uncomfortable silent nights in her life. Recently, she and Donald were invited to Clinton's farewell dinner. She put her fear to one side because she really wanted to meet him. \"Suddenly, I was placed beside Clinton and I couldn't say a word. I was 18 and I was terrified, and there were so many things I wanted to say to him.\" Then there was the night with Woody Allen and Bergman.\"I was doing A Doll's House a long time ago on Broadway and Woody Allen was kind of courting me, probably to get to know Ingmar . Then Ingmar came to New York to see me in A Doll's House. He stayed in a hotel with Ingrid, whom he had just married. I told him Woody Allen wanted to meet him. Ingmar wanted to meet him, and he said come to my suite and we will have dinner. Then Woody Allen came to get me and he was so excited, he was shivering and talking, talking. Anyway, Ingmar opened the door and said welcome. That's all he said. And the two of them looked at each other. Two geniuses met. We sat down at the table - and this is the honest to God truth, Ingrid was sitting there, I was sitting there, Ingmar there, and Woody Allen there - and they did not talk. They just looked at each other, almost lovingly. Ingrid, for once, was allowed to talk at the table, so she talked to me about meatballs. We talked about meatballs because I didn't know what to talk about. And in the middle of the thing she gave me my child support in an envelope and said this is for Linn next year. It was a little embarrassing in front of Woody Allen. So she did that and I hated her a little more. And the two of them would look at each other and smile, look at these two sweet women. I hated that - that I was only a meatball person - and probably she hated that, too. They never talked. They never talked. They laughed to each other but never said a word. Then it was over and they said goodbye . On the way home Woody Allen said, 'Thank you. He is an incredible man.' I couldn't believe it. Then, when I came home, Ingmar called, 'Thank you, Liv, what an incredible meeting.'\" These days, she would not so easily be patronised as a daffy little woman. When she was a young success, more militant feminists attacked her as a conservative. \"It was because I was pleasing. They were maybe right, but they are more pleasing now than I am.\" She is less pleasing than she used to be? \"Yes, I strive to be. I used to say, poor little me, I'm not strong. But I am strong.\" She laughs at the idea that she thought she'd reached her sell-by date in her mid-30s. Now, there's so much to look forward to. \"I want to be available... maybe for my grandson, for living, for whatever...\" Would she ever have plastic surgery? \"Never. Never did. Never will.\" Why not? \"Because I want to see what I was meant to be, what my face is meant to be.\" Donald joins us. They look happy together. Did she think things would work out okay when she started out? \"Yes, but in a different way. I thought my mother would praise me and my men would praise me, and my daughter would praise me, and they don't necessarily praise me. But I praise myself. I'm not big in my head, and I don't feel terrible about myself, and I'm not a drunk, and I've not burnt out, and I have feelings, and I feel very young inside. I think I'm a very okay person, and that's the best thing I've done in life.\" Ullmann tells me of the last time she saw Bergman. Yes, of course, they fought and disagreed, but they also realised that they had reached an understanding. \"We have found what real love is. It's respect, trust, admiration. It's everything except sex. But, you know, even that is there, the fondness, wanting to hug, wanting to hold hands. The last time I saw him he followed me down to my hotel in Stockholm. It was very late and I really wanted to go because I'd been sitting in his flat for a long time. And he said I'll follow you home and I said no, you don't have to. Then suddenly it was a wonderful, wonderful walk. We didn't say much. We went by a church where his father had been a preacher and it wasn't so much what he said, and it wasn't sex at all, but it was the same intimacy as sex, the way we were walking that night. And he was moved and I was moved because we hadn't been walking in the street in the dark alone for 30 years since we'd been lovers.\" Liv, Ingmar and Donald: it could be one of Bergman's films but, of course, in the movies things never turn out as well as in real life \u0095 Faithless is released on February 9.",

      "byline": "Peter Lennon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For the past two weeks, Paris has been witnessing the spectacle of a former foreign minister, Roland Dumas,appearing in the dock to answer charges of corruption. There is some \u00a36m in kickbacks and a mistress at the heart of these charges, but what has devastated the French establishment is that Dumas was, at the time of the original accusation in 1997, France's highest legal authority, the president of the Constitutional Council. He finally resigned last year. </p> <p>What law officer could have dared to initiate and obstinately bring to its awful conclusion an investigation targeting the highest legal authority in the land? Well, it wasn't a Frenchman. It was, in fact, a former Norwegian au pair, Gro Eva Farseth, who married into a distinguished French family and then appalled them by transforming herself into the all-powerful Investigating Magistrate, Madame Eva Joly. As such, she has become the scourge of France's untouchables - the business moguls and political leaders. A co-defendant in the Dumas affair is the former president of the oil giant Elf-Aquitaine, one-time head of the state-owned railway network, SNCF. But this case forms only a small part of Eva Joly's spectacular reach. She was also instrumental in uncovering the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais banking scandal, described in 1997 as the world's biggest financial disaster. Her investigations into the Elf affair uncovered a political slush fund that went beyond the borders of France to touch Germany's former chancellor, Helmut Kohl. And then there was the affair of the frigates sold to Taiwan... All this was achieved in a post that Eva Joly has held for only seven years. </p> <p>It all started more than 30 years ago, when the 20-year-old Gro Eva Farseth travelled to Paris from her home in Oslo to study French. Already on the train down, there was a hint of the determination and steadiness of purpose to come: instead of preparing herself for Parisian life with Elle magazine or Paris Match, she passed the journey studying French verbs. She very soon found a position as au pair in an urban palace by the Luxembourg gardens, home of the Joly family. This was a family that had for generations contributed soldiers, scientists and academics to the glory of their country. </p> <p>When Gro was courteously permitted by her employers to dine with them, she became privy to the etiquette that distinguishes such a family of true taste from that of - well, plebeian is too base a concept - let's say the nouveau riche. As you stir your coffee, for instance, the ear must not be offended by the sound of the spoon touching the bottom. Nor must you ever cut your lettuce; it must be folded. </p> <p>Mlle Farseth caught on quickly that observance of a dozen or so rules would see you comfortably through the best drawing rooms. But what this condescending family of distinguished lineage did not realise about Growas that, while she might be what they would call brute de coffrage (unpolished), she had powerful values of her own. The most deadly proved to be an inherent lack of respect for hierarchy. There is no aristocracy in Norway. Gro is the daughter of a carpenter, and her family lived at one point in the same apartment block in Oslo as their prime minister. </p> <p>There is one photograph of Madame Eva Joly that delights egalitarians. It is January 23, 1998, and we see a reserved lady escorting a distinguished, grey-haired man into his residence in the 5th arrondissement. It is Joly arriving to conduct personally a search of the home of the president of the Constitutional Council, Roland Dumas. </p> <p>To give the full measure to the difficulties faced by Joly: before her appointment as Investigating Magistrate in 1994, no corporate financial prosecution of any real weight had ever been brought before a French tribunal. There was neither resource nor inclination for such an enterprise. </p> <p>To bring to justice some of the country's most powerful men and corporations, certain conditions must prevail: the perpetrators must be already vulnerable (usually when a belief in immunity makes them careless); tradition must be a shield for the magistrate, rather than a block; luck must provide opportunity; and, above all, you must have the character to want to act. Over many years, all these fell into place for Mme Joly. </p> <p>Seven years ago, Eva Joly (you couldn't go around France calling yourself \"Gro\") finally made it as a Juge d'Instruction (Investigating Magistrate). Many of the world's legal systems harbour a subversive corner, protected by tradition, that caters for society's need to guarantee a last-ditch stand against tyranny. Such a system operated successfully in Spain against Pinochet; and we saw similar independent legal powers abused in the Lewinsky/Clinton affair. A Juge d'Instruction is one of them: a legal officer with unlimited powers of investigation and rigorously protected independence. Not even the president of the republic can fire a Juge d'Instruction. The establishment's one recourse, when investigations become too embarrassing, is to promote him, or her, out of office, normally a very successful ploy creating only minimal criticism. Mme Joly has refused that kind of promotion. </p> <p>When Roland Dumas, who denies the allegations, was preparing to face the court, I met Eva Joly in Paris. She received me in the new headquarters of the Investigating Magistrates close to metro L'Op\u00e9ra. There is a certain symbolism in the recent removal of this department from the Palais de Justice, where it formerly occupied a few cubbyholes. For all its intimidating exterior, the Palais de Justice is not secure. Joly's office in the Palais was burgled more than once. </p> <p>The new spacious offices are protected by surveillance cameras, metal detectors and an armed policeman with his copy of Joly's book, Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous (Everybody's Business - a reference to the degree fiscal fraud affects us all). \"I haven't had the chance to ask her to autograph it yet,\" the policeman told me. Joly currently enjoys that rarest of honours in France: the hero worship of cops... well, some of them, at any rate. </p> <p>Inherently democratic (and still short of staff), Joly herself came down to the lobby to escort me back to her office. She wore a bright, sky-blue suit, very unmagisterial. You would have guessed an executive of a fashionable corporation. She is 57. It is only recently, she confided, that she has had the confidence to discard the traditional authoritarian black garb of the lawyer. She speaks with careful precision, but without the theatrical gravity one expects from lawyers, nor do you get any sense of a lawyer's perpetual calculation. The character that comes through is almost neighbourly - a confident, candid person, but not lacking in prudence. </p> <p>It's hard to know what the Joly family was thinking of, taking a 20-year-old Scandinavian into a family where there was a 21-year-old son. Aristocratic inattention might explain it. \"In opening their doors to me,\" she agrees, \"the Joly family were perhaps playing with fire.\" Very soon, the scion declared he would marry Gro Farseth. They disinherited him. Values must be maintained. </p> <p>Initially, the young couple went through the usual impecunious struggle with first one child and then another coming in close succession. He studied to be a doctor; she worked as a secretary in a factory. </p> <p>There was an early manifestation of Eva's determination to see justice done. To the astonishment of her employer, the young foreigner decided that the working conditions in the factory were \"not worthy\". She formed a branch of the CFDT (Christian trade union). \"We have nourished a viper in our bosom,\" wailed her boss, rather elegantly. </p> <p>But the successful crusader never allows a passion for justice to carry her to self-destructive extremes. \"I found,\" she says, \"that trades union organisation was too much for me while at the same time having to hold down a job and take care of children in a sixth-storey walk-up\". The time for action was not yet ripe. </p> <p>In 1973, her husband moved to a new practice in Essonne, to the south of Paris. By then, Eva had a law degree and quickly found work in a psychiatric hospital in the region. Her role was to deal with the legal problems of the mentally disturbed - for instance, a patient who (against Eva's advice) made a generous gift of all his money to his family and then found himself abandoned as his relatives grabbed the money and emigrated to Canada. The hospital had, she says, a congenial atmosphere of dedicated public service. \"I received my political education there.\" She dealt compassionately with socially dysfunctional creatures, recognised as such and treated accordingly - unlike the socially dysfunctional high-level thieves she was to deal with later, whom tradition protected from either treatment or restraint. </p> <p>But she was still a long way from the Palais de Justice. Being a foreigner, there was little possibility of making her way up the judicial ladder. She would be considered by the establishment as having \"an insufficiency of general French culture\". To break through that barrier would require a small miracle. <strong> </strong> Joly does not believe in miracles. But when I put to her the Shakespearean proposition that \"There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood\", she admitted this much: \"When you work hard, at one point a kind of resonance, a harmony, is created and there comes the moment when 'the mayonnaise takes'.\" </p> <p>In 1981, the French government decided to hold a one-off open competition for entry to the magistrature. French culture would not be crucial. Not only was it an opening to the magistrature, it was an accelerated one for those with 10 years' legal experience, which Joly now had. After a couple of months at magistrates' school, the successful applicant would go to work in the courts immediately. Suddenly, Eva Joly found herself assistant to the public prosecutor of Orl\u00e9ans. </p> <p>The first day was not propitious. When she greeted her new boss with a civil \"Bonjour, Monsieur\", he snapped: \"Please, Madame, in the time, which I hope will be short, that we will spend together, I ask you to address me as Monsieur le Procureur. We have not spent time together taking care of pigs.\" She left, disenchanted, after two years, convinced that the main preoccupations of her superior \"were problems of parking his car\". </p> <p>She gave up the magistrature and got a position with the CIRI, in the ministry of finance, in Paris. She was already 46, with apparently nothing but a routine future in store. But she entered the ministry at a time when the government was focusing on the industrial reconstruction of France, a noble national enterprise within which many a maggot was to find nourishment. Her job concerned \"businesses in difficulties\" - ie, bankruptcies - which were then reaching dizzying proportions in France. \"I was given genuine responsibility and this gave me wings,\" she says. </p> <p>After three years of desk duty, she was back in the magistrature. Appointed a Juge d'Instruction concerned with financial crimes, she moved to the Palais de Justice. \"It was only seven years ago,\" she said, \"and I was a million miles from imagining what I would discover. I still had confidence in the institutions.\" She assumed that her resources at the Palais would be as grandiose as that intimidating building. \"What I found was a poky little office,\" she said, \"with an old Olivetti typewriter. There was no fax and no Minitel [the French computer linked to the telephone system]. I had one clerk. </p> <p>\"No one said that you cannot deal with an affair involving great international banks, concerning tens of billions of francs, with one judge in a chambre de bonne, a ballpoint pen and a copy of the Penal Code. The contrast with the ministry of finance was shocking. I discovered that one of the most serious cases had been on the books for five years. At the CIRI, I had worked with people who could have cleared it up in 10 days.\" During the course of her investigation into the Elf case, she had to deal with more than 60 lawyers, studying 50 volumes of evidence. </p> <p>\"I dumped the typewriter in a cupboard. My daughter [now a doctor] had a basic computer bought from the supermarket; I borrowed it. I installed the Minitel from my own home. I bought a fax with my own money, not for comfort but efficiency - the Penal Code permits the use of fax in place of expensive registered letter,\" she says. \"I sold my old car to an architect and then persuaded him to redesign my office. The other magistrates were conquered, amused.\" </p> <p>Joly soon discovered the dubious worth of amused admiration: it vanished when she showed her combative side. The only hope for obtaining any real improvement in her working conditions was to go public. She took part in a short TV documentary exposing the farcical lack of resources granted to fiscal investigators. It created a sensation. Then she gave a long interview to an economic journal, La Tribune, which appeared the very day she descended on Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais with a search warrant. Horror at the Palais! But there was serious panic when the Garde des Sceaux (minister for justice), Elisabeth Guigou, made her displeasure at such publicity tactics known in an unsisterly interview in the newspaper Le Figaro. Joly was summoned before the vice-president of the courts and warned that she was overstepping the line (actually, he said she was walking outside the pedestrian crossing). </p> <p>Jacques Chirac's government learned of the serious problems at the state-owned Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais in October 1995. Although the losses, attributed to bad management, were estimated at a staggering \u00a312.8bn, no one believed there would be a criminal prosecution. Financial mismanagement was not thought to be a criminal offence. But this was not a belief shared by Mme Joly. The taxpayer had to meet these losses. The bank was headed by Jean-Yves Haberer, a high-flyer in the financial world and at one time fellow student of President Chirac at the elite Ecole National d'Administration (ENA). Haberer's most bizarre and ultimately fatal decision was, in 1991, to lend a dodgy Italian financier, Giancarlo Parretti, money to buy the Hollywood studio, MGM. After a number of farcical manoeuvres, which included giving Dustin Hoffman a six-figure rubber cheque, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais had to move in and become a working partner of MGM. It soon had to sell the studio at a huge loss. The bank became known as D\u00e9bit Lyonnais. </p> <p>Eva Joly will not, on principle, discuss any of her cases, past or current, but it is known that after a year of investigations at Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, when her team was getting uncomfortably close to essentials, there was a mysterious fire at the bank. More than 2,500 files relating to the case were destroyed. This is the kind of setback Mme Joly and her colleagues take in their stride. The Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais case still lumbers on, spawning other investigations that now suggest a presidential cover-up. </p> <p>She continued with her campaign for better facilities and suddenly one evening the president of the courts paid a visit to her chambre de bonne. \"He had probably never been in that part of the building,\" she says. Fellow magistrates had expressed approval for her stand, but none of them turned up for the confrontation with the president. \"Magistrates prefer more velvety t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates.\" By this time, Joly had a valuable new colleague, another Juge d'Instruction, Laurence Vichnievsky. If the men chose diplomatic absence, the two women were not intimidated in their confrontation with the president. </p> <p>From that day everything changed. \"Suddenly, there was nothing more urgent than to create a financial centre.\" That was only three years ago. Joly and Vichnievsky found themselves with a new HQ. They also established contact with a like-minded magistrate in a crucial financial area - Switzerland. </p> <p>Changes were already taking place in France that help explain Eva Joly's success. Following the economic crisis of the 80s and the increase in bankruptcy frauds, a new law on bankruptcy was passed. The role of the courts was reinforced. There was a new breed of lawyers and there was also a new generation of better-informed police; the economic crisis had attracted police with more diplomas than the earlier ones. The commissaire who handled the Elf case was a product of St Cyr (an elite academy for the military and gendarmerie), and only 29 years old. But one vital factor was for her to have, at a crucial moment, a colleague of similar resolution and courage in Laurence Vichnievsky. </p> <p>The main facts of the Elf case are now in the open. There are many strands. The former French foreign minister is not only accused of accepting kickbacks indirectly from the bagman of the affair, a former director of Elf-Aquitaine now said to be in hiding in the Philippines, but is also accused of having inexplicably (at the time) reversed a government embargo on arms sales to Taiwan and encouraged the sale of frigates to go through (which involved generous comissions for some). Elf was also involved in this affair. And so was Christine Deviers-Joncour, Dumas's mistress and Elf's favourite lobbyist. Elf allegedly gave her a company credit line of \u00a320,000 a month and a \u00a31.7m apartment on the Left Bank for entertainment. Joly and Vichnievsky allege that she passed on expensive \"gifts\" to Dumas. The 53-year-old Mme Deviers-Joncour has now become a notorious performer on French TV, following the publication of her memoirs called, The Whore Of The Republic. </p> <p>\"To deal with an affair such as Elf,\" Joly says, \"common sense suggests the mobilisation of dozens of policemen, the collaboration of public services such as the secret service, of tax officials, and that all the weight of the republic be brought to bear on foreign countries who refuse to aid us. But the state, that is you and I, and all taxpayers, allow ourselves to be robbed without reacting.\" </p> <p>What is behind this curious laxity? Joly says that the intrinsic problem is that high-class financial crimes \"were not really considered a crime\". There was also the undermining tradition that those at a certain level of power and influence were above the law. \"The great fiscal frauds involved very powerful and respectable people who were convinced - and still are - that they are entitled to be above the law. There is a culture of passe droit. That the law is not equal for everybody. Because you are a minister or a high-ranking personage, you could have immunity. In Norway, there is not this submission to power, to the establishment. Here, there is a notion that this kind of thing does not concern Justice [the courts]. There is also a tradition of 'proximity' regarding government and the law. Some of the attorney generals in France were collaborators of ministers and the president. </p> <p>\"But I realised I would have to treat financial scandals like any other crime. Someone robs a petrol station. He is pursued methodically; the culprit is caught, his home searched and he is sentenced to 10 years. But when the head of an organisation steals a hundred million, Justice surrounds itself with precautionary luxuries. There are prolonged preliminary enquiries, interviews, interminable strings of 'experts'.\" </p> <p>Joly was determined, so far as possible, to speed up the process. \"We investigated,\" she said, \"put a tail on people and searched premises, no matter whose.\" In the past year alone, Joly took part in 40 searches. In five years, she has dealt with 200 cases. </p> <p>What was the initial reaction when she started to put a tail on distinguished citizens as if they were common thieves, and went rummaging through their private property? At first, they blamed it on her \"Protestantism\" and her nationality. </p> <p>\"People tried to get the public to believe that, because I was a Norwegian and a Protestant, I did not understand anything of what was going on in France,\" she says. \"Actually, I have little contact with religion. This line worked for a while because most people did not want to believe that you can't always have confidence in elected chiefs.\" </p> <p>There were also indignant articles in the press, of a kind familiar to us in Britain, about the cruel treatment of wealthy offenders whose \"poor health\" becomes a major issue. Dumas succeeded in putting off his court appearance for months on these grounds. Then the attacks took a more sophisticated and deadly turn. \"They began to say that the independent powers of the Juge d'Instruction were an attack on liberty, that the judges were dangerous. There was a public debate, which totally falsified the issues. It nearly succeeded.\" </p> <p>To begin with, public opinion was not always 100% behind her. The public and the media can be indulgent towards popular figures. One example is Bernard Tapie. A rather reckless businessman and one-time minister for urban affairs, he was briefly revered as the owner of European Cup winners, Olympique Marseille. He became bankrupt (he owed Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais more than \u00a3100m) and went to prison for corruption. How supportive was the media in these affairs, I asked. </p> <p>For the first time, Joly becomes extremely guarded. She is only too well aware that taking on the press can be a losing game. She hints at disappointment, not just with the popular press (although in France they are nothing like as muckily \"popular\" as our crowd), but also with the more responsible papers. She rarely responds to such attacks, but when one newspaper, alluding to prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigations into the Clinton/Lewinsky affair in the US, carried the headline, \"EVA - OUR STARR IN STILETTOS\", and Joly felt it implied that she had suspects beaten up, she fought back. The story was based on a mythical remark, supposedly made to a police escort: \"Why did you bring him to me so fresh?\" Joly invoked her right of reply. Sternly quoting the legal reference - article 13 of the law of July 29, 1881 - she took apart these fictions about \"this blonde capable of humiliating [people] and making them tremble\". \"I felt I must answer. It was the messenger they wanted killed.\" </p> <p>So, are the media more supportive now? All she would say to this is: \"The newspapers still don't adequately cover this issue.\" </p> <p>The next day, Saturday, I waited for her in a cafe across from the Palais de Justice. When on weekend duty, she is obliged to work again from the Palais. Any crime of a serious nature taking place that weekend in Paris, she and her clerk had to deal with. As she crossed the road, I noted she had reverted to black. With her was a tall, athletic man in running shoes. He was attentive, but with the air of a discreet servant rather than a friend. He showed no sign of wanting to take part in our conversation, but every now and then he spoke into his coat collar. </p> <p>Fifty yards away, another man was putting on one of those performances of taking no interest in us, but he also nosed his collar at intervals. At one point, she made a puzzling remark: \"I got my first new car in 1996, but I still have not driven it.\" I realised then why she never managed to drive her new car. She has permanent, around-the-clock driver-bodyguards. At crucial moments in her investigations, her office in the Palais was burgled, drawers ransacked or locks tampered with. There was clear intimidation in the absence of any attempt to conceal traces of forced entry. There have also been death threats. </p> <p>When she went jogging the next morning at 8am, the tall discreet man jogged alongside, a weapon somehow concealed in his jogging gear. The other drove the car. She trotted around the grounds, bereft of any vanity aids. So I was surprised when she agreed to be photographed panting around in sweaty gear. She admitted later that it was a deliberate decision. This magistrate has another mission - to demonstrate to other women that life is by no means over at 57. This is one of the reasons she dares nowadays to dress colourfully, to declare her femininity even on duty. \"I lost a lot of time to get to this point,\" she admitted. </p> <p>Gradually, there was a transformation in her manner, a definite shift from jurisprudential objectivity to bubbling, subterranean exuberance, hinting at satisfaction with the joys of life. Now that she is - at least for the moment - master of her trade, such satisfaction would be understandable. But a recent long holiday in the heartstopping beauty and purity of the fjords of her native Norway might have contributed to her joie de vivre. </p> <p>What does her family-in-law now think of little Gro Farseth? There appears to have been something of a reconciliation. \"They think it is funny that I am a judge, but some of the family still think it is not right that a Norwegian-born person should be judging French people.\" </p> <p>Eva Joly is under no illusion as to how successful this fight against global financial crime can be. She says only a tiny fraction of the crimes are being dealt with. \"The one achievement is that it is now more difficult to suppress cases... But we are still like sheriffs in those westerns, where you chase the bad men to the Rio Grande and they just ride across the river and we can't follow.\" Global crime, she believes, requires a global force. To create one will be her next crusade </p> <p>\u0095 Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous, by Eva Joly, is published by Les Arenes, 33 rue Linn\u00e9, Paris 5005, priced Fr99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the past two weeks, Paris has been witnessing the spectacle of a former foreign minister, Roland Dumas,appearing in the dock to answer charges of corruption. There is some \u00a36m in kickbacks and a mistress at the heart of these charges, but what has devastated the French establishment is that Dumas was, at the time of the original accusation in 1997, France's highest legal authority, the president of the Constitutional Council. He finally resigned last year. What law officer could have dared to initiate and obstinately bring to its awful conclusion an investigation targeting the highest legal authority in the land? Well, it wasn't a Frenchman. It was, in fact, a former Norwegian au pair, Gro Eva Farseth, who married into a distinguished French family and then appalled them by transforming herself into the all-powerful Investigating Magistrate, Madame Eva Joly. As such, she has become the scourge of France's untouchables - the business moguls and political leaders. A co-defendant in the Dumas affair is the former president of the oil giant Elf-Aquitaine, one-time head of the state-owned railway network, SNCF. But this case forms only a small part of Eva Joly's spectacular reach. She was also instrumental in uncovering the Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais banking scandal, described in 1997 as the world's biggest financial disaster. Her investigations into the Elf affair uncovered a political slush fund that went beyond the borders of France to touch Germany's former chancellor, Helmut Kohl. And then there was the affair of the frigates sold to Taiwan... All this was achieved in a post that Eva Joly has held for only seven years. It all started more than 30 years ago, when the 20-year-old Gro Eva Farseth travelled to Paris from her home in Oslo to study French. Already on the train down, there was a hint of the determination and steadiness of purpose to come: instead of preparing herself for Parisian life with Elle magazine or Paris Match, she passed the journey studying French verbs. She very soon found a position as au pair in an urban palace by the Luxembourg gardens, home of the Joly family. This was a family that had for generations contributed soldiers, scientists and academics to the glory of their country. When Gro was courteously permitted by her employers to dine with them, she became privy to the etiquette that distinguishes such a family of true taste from that of - well, plebeian is too base a concept - let's say the nouveau riche. As you stir your coffee, for instance, the ear must not be offended by the sound of the spoon touching the bottom. Nor must you ever cut your lettuce; it must be folded. Mlle Farseth caught on quickly that observance of a dozen or so rules would see you comfortably through the best drawing rooms. But what this condescending family of distinguished lineage did not realise about Growas that, while she might be what they would call brute de coffrage (unpolished), she had powerful values of her own. The most deadly proved to be an inherent lack of respect for hierarchy. There is no aristocracy in Norway. Gro is the daughter of a carpenter, and her family lived at one point in the same apartment block in Oslo as their prime minister. There is one photograph of Madame Eva Joly that delights egalitarians. It is January 23, 1998, and we see a reserved lady escorting a distinguished, grey-haired man into his residence in the 5th arrondissement. It is Joly arriving to conduct personally a search of the home of the president of the Constitutional Council, Roland Dumas. To give the full measure to the difficulties faced by Joly: before her appointment as Investigating Magistrate in 1994, no corporate financial prosecution of any real weight had ever been brought before a French tribunal. There was neither resource nor inclination for such an enterprise. To bring to justice some of the country's most powerful men and corporations, certain conditions must prevail: the perpetrators must be already vulnerable (usually when a belief in immunity makes them careless); tradition must be a shield for the magistrate, rather than a block; luck must provide opportunity; and, above all, you must have the character to want to act. Over many years, all these fell into place for Mme Joly. Seven years ago, Eva Joly (you couldn't go around France calling yourself \"Gro\") finally made it as a Juge d'Instruction (Investigating Magistrate). Many of the world's legal systems harbour a subversive corner, protected by tradition, that caters for society's need to guarantee a last-ditch stand against tyranny. Such a system operated successfully in Spain against Pinochet; and we saw similar independent legal powers abused in the Lewinsky/Clinton affair. A Juge d'Instruction is one of them: a legal officer with unlimited powers of investigation and rigorously protected independence. Not even the president of the republic can fire a Juge d'Instruction. The establishment's one recourse, when investigations become too embarrassing, is to promote him, or her, out of office, normally a very successful ploy creating only minimal criticism. Mme Joly has refused that kind of promotion. When Roland Dumas, who denies the allegations, was preparing to face the court, I met Eva Joly in Paris. She received me in the new headquarters of the Investigating Magistrates close to metro L'Op\u00e9ra. There is a certain symbolism in the recent removal of this department from the Palais de Justice, where it formerly occupied a few cubbyholes. For all its intimidating exterior, the Palais de Justice is not secure. Joly's office in the Palais was burgled more than once. The new spacious offices are protected by surveillance cameras, metal detectors and an armed policeman with his copy of Joly's book, Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous (Everybody's Business - a reference to the degree fiscal fraud affects us all). \"I haven't had the chance to ask her to autograph it yet,\" the policeman told me. Joly currently enjoys that rarest of honours in France: the hero worship of cops... well, some of them, at any rate. Inherently democratic (and still short of staff), Joly herself came down to the lobby to escort me back to her office. She wore a bright, sky-blue suit, very unmagisterial. You would have guessed an executive of a fashionable corporation. She is 57. It is only recently, she confided, that she has had the confidence to discard the traditional authoritarian black garb of the lawyer. She speaks with careful precision, but without the theatrical gravity one expects from lawyers, nor do you get any sense of a lawyer's perpetual calculation. The character that comes through is almost neighbourly - a confident, candid person, but not lacking in prudence. It's hard to know what the Joly family was thinking of, taking a 20-year-old Scandinavian into a family where there was a 21-year-old son. Aristocratic inattention might explain it. \"In opening their doors to me,\" she agrees, \"the Joly family were perhaps playing with fire.\" Very soon, the scion declared he would marry Gro Farseth. They disinherited him. Values must be maintained. Initially, the young couple went through the usual impecunious struggle with first one child and then another coming in close succession. He studied to be a doctor; she worked as a secretary in a factory. There was an early manifestation of Eva's determination to see justice done. To the astonishment of her employer, the young foreigner decided that the working conditions in the factory were \"not worthy\". She formed a branch of the CFDT (Christian trade union). \"We have nourished a viper in our bosom,\" wailed her boss, rather elegantly. But the successful crusader never allows a passion for justice to carry her to self-destructive extremes. \"I found,\" she says, \"that trades union organisation was too much for me while at the same time having to hold down a job and take care of children in a sixth-storey walk-up\". The time for action was not yet ripe. In 1973, her husband moved to a new practice in Essonne, to the south of Paris. By then, Eva had a law degree and quickly found work in a psychiatric hospital in the region. Her role was to deal with the legal problems of the mentally disturbed - for instance, a patient who (against Eva's advice) made a generous gift of all his money to his family and then found himself abandoned as his relatives grabbed the money and emigrated to Canada. The hospital had, she says, a congenial atmosphere of dedicated public service. \"I received my political education there.\" She dealt compassionately with socially dysfunctional creatures, recognised as such and treated accordingly - unlike the socially dysfunctional high-level thieves she was to deal with later, whom tradition protected from either treatment or restraint. But she was still a long way from the Palais de Justice. Being a foreigner, there was little possibility of making her way up the judicial ladder. She would be considered by the establishment as having \"an insufficiency of general French culture\". To break through that barrier would require a small miracle. Joly does not believe in miracles. But when I put to her the Shakespearean proposition that \"There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood\", she admitted this much: \"When you work hard, at one point a kind of resonance, a harmony, is created and there comes the moment when 'the mayonnaise takes'.\" In 1981, the French government decided to hold a one-off open competition for entry to the magistrature. French culture would not be crucial. Not only was it an opening to the magistrature, it was an accelerated one for those with 10 years' legal experience, which Joly now had. After a couple of months at magistrates' school, the successful applicant would go to work in the courts immediately. Suddenly, Eva Joly found herself assistant to the public prosecutor of Orl\u00e9ans. The first day was not propitious. When she greeted her new boss with a civil \"Bonjour, Monsieur\", he snapped: \"Please, Madame, in the time, which I hope will be short, that we will spend together, I ask you to address me as Monsieur le Procureur. We have not spent time together taking care of pigs.\" She left, disenchanted, after two years, convinced that the main preoccupations of her superior \"were problems of parking his car\". She gave up the magistrature and got a position with the CIRI, in the ministry of finance, in Paris. She was already 46, with apparently nothing but a routine future in store. But she entered the ministry at a time when the government was focusing on the industrial reconstruction of France, a noble national enterprise within which many a maggot was to find nourishment. Her job concerned \"businesses in difficulties\" - ie, bankruptcies - which were then reaching dizzying proportions in France. \"I was given genuine responsibility and this gave me wings,\" she says. After three years of desk duty, she was back in the magistrature. Appointed a Juge d'Instruction concerned with financial crimes, she moved to the Palais de Justice. \"It was only seven years ago,\" she said, \"and I was a million miles from imagining what I would discover. I still had confidence in the institutions.\" She assumed that her resources at the Palais would be as grandiose as that intimidating building. \"What I found was a poky little office,\" she said, \"with an old Olivetti typewriter. There was no fax and no Minitel [the French computer linked to the telephone system]. I had one clerk. \"No one said that you cannot deal with an affair involving great international banks, concerning tens of billions of francs, with one judge in a chambre de bonne, a ballpoint pen and a copy of the Penal Code. The contrast with the ministry of finance was shocking. I discovered that one of the most serious cases had been on the books for five years. At the CIRI, I had worked with people who could have cleared it up in 10 days.\" During the course of her investigation into the Elf case, she had to deal with more than 60 lawyers, studying 50 volumes of evidence. \"I dumped the typewriter in a cupboard. My daughter [now a doctor] had a basic computer bought from the supermarket; I borrowed it. I installed the Minitel from my own home. I bought a fax with my own money, not for comfort but efficiency - the Penal Code permits the use of fax in place of expensive registered letter,\" she says. \"I sold my old car to an architect and then persuaded him to redesign my office. The other magistrates were conquered, amused.\" Joly soon discovered the dubious worth of amused admiration: it vanished when she showed her combative side. The only hope for obtaining any real improvement in her working conditions was to go public. She took part in a short TV documentary exposing the farcical lack of resources granted to fiscal investigators. It created a sensation. Then she gave a long interview to an economic journal, La Tribune, which appeared the very day she descended on Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais with a search warrant. Horror at the Palais! But there was serious panic when the Garde des Sceaux (minister for justice), Elisabeth Guigou, made her displeasure at such publicity tactics known in an unsisterly interview in the newspaper Le Figaro. Joly was summoned before the vice-president of the courts and warned that she was overstepping the line (actually, he said she was walking outside the pedestrian crossing). Jacques Chirac's government learned of the serious problems at the state-owned Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais in October 1995. Although the losses, attributed to bad management, were estimated at a staggering \u00a312.8bn, no one believed there would be a criminal prosecution. Financial mismanagement was not thought to be a criminal offence. But this was not a belief shared by Mme Joly. The taxpayer had to meet these losses. The bank was headed by Jean-Yves Haberer, a high-flyer in the financial world and at one time fellow student of President Chirac at the elite Ecole National d'Administration (ENA). Haberer's most bizarre and ultimately fatal decision was, in 1991, to lend a dodgy Italian financier, Giancarlo Parretti, money to buy the Hollywood studio, MGM. After a number of farcical manoeuvres, which included giving Dustin Hoffman a six-figure rubber cheque, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais had to move in and become a working partner of MGM. It soon had to sell the studio at a huge loss. The bank became known as D\u00e9bit Lyonnais. Eva Joly will not, on principle, discuss any of her cases, past or current, but it is known that after a year of investigations at Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, when her team was getting uncomfortably close to essentials, there was a mysterious fire at the bank. More than 2,500 files relating to the case were destroyed. This is the kind of setback Mme Joly and her colleagues take in their stride. The Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais case still lumbers on, spawning other investigations that now suggest a presidential cover-up. She continued with her campaign for better facilities and suddenly one evening the president of the courts paid a visit to her chambre de bonne. \"He had probably never been in that part of the building,\" she says. Fellow magistrates had expressed approval for her stand, but none of them turned up for the confrontation with the president. \"Magistrates prefer more velvety t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates.\" By this time, Joly had a valuable new colleague, another Juge d'Instruction, Laurence Vichnievsky. If the men chose diplomatic absence, the two women were not intimidated in their confrontation with the president. From that day everything changed. \"Suddenly, there was nothing more urgent than to create a financial centre.\" That was only three years ago. Joly and Vichnievsky found themselves with a new HQ. They also established contact with a like-minded magistrate in a crucial financial area - Switzerland. Changes were already taking place in France that help explain Eva Joly's success. Following the economic crisis of the 80s and the increase in bankruptcy frauds, a new law on bankruptcy was passed. The role of the courts was reinforced. There was a new breed of lawyers and there was also a new generation of better-informed police; the economic crisis had attracted police with more diplomas than the earlier ones. The commissaire who handled the Elf case was a product of St Cyr (an elite academy for the military and gendarmerie), and only 29 years old. But one vital factor was for her to have, at a crucial moment, a colleague of similar resolution and courage in Laurence Vichnievsky. The main facts of the Elf case are now in the open. There are many strands. The former French foreign minister is not only accused of accepting kickbacks indirectly from the bagman of the affair, a former director of Elf-Aquitaine now said to be in hiding in the Philippines, but is also accused of having inexplicably (at the time) reversed a government embargo on arms sales to Taiwan and encouraged the sale of frigates to go through (which involved generous comissions for some). Elf was also involved in this affair. And so was Christine Deviers-Joncour, Dumas's mistress and Elf's favourite lobbyist. Elf allegedly gave her a company credit line of \u00a320,000 a month and a \u00a31.7m apartment on the Left Bank for entertainment. Joly and Vichnievsky allege that she passed on expensive \"gifts\" to Dumas. The 53-year-old Mme Deviers-Joncour has now become a notorious performer on French TV, following the publication of her memoirs called, The Whore Of The Republic. \"To deal with an affair such as Elf,\" Joly says, \"common sense suggests the mobilisation of dozens of policemen, the collaboration of public services such as the secret service, of tax officials, and that all the weight of the republic be brought to bear on foreign countries who refuse to aid us. But the state, that is you and I, and all taxpayers, allow ourselves to be robbed without reacting.\" What is behind this curious laxity? Joly says that the intrinsic problem is that high-class financial crimes \"were not really considered a crime\".

But a recent long holiday in the heartstopping beauty and purity of the fjords of her native Norway might have contributed to her joie de vivre. What does her family-in-law now think of little Gro Farseth? There appears to have been something of a reconciliation. \"They think it is funny that I am a judge, but some of the family still think it is not right that a Norwegian-born person should be judging French people.\" Eva Joly is under no illusion as to how successful this fight against global financial crime can be. She says only a tiny fraction of the crimes are being dealt with. \"The one achievement is that it is now more difficult to suppress cases... But we are still like sheriffs in those westerns, where you chase the bad men to the Rio Grande and they just ride across the river and we can't follow.\" Global crime, she believes, requires a global force. To create one will be her next crusade \u0095 Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous, by Eva Joly, is published by Les Arenes, 33 rue Linn\u00e9, Paris 5005, priced Fr99.",

      "body": "<p>Marie Jos\u00e9, the last Queen of Italy, who has died in Geneva at the age of 94, was an independent-minded royal whose opposition to fascism might have offered a last chance to save the discredited House of Savoy and therefore the Italian monarchy. She was known as \"the May Queen\" because she and her husband, King Umberto II, reigned for just 27 days, from May 9 1946.</p> <p>On June 2 that year, Italians voted in a referendum to abolish the monarchy, mindful of King Victor Emmanuel III's close association with fascism and the disasters it had brought on their country. Republicans won the vote by only a narrow margin and a plan, proposed by the philosopher Benedetto Croce, to replace Umberto with his infant son Victor Emmanuel, and have the beautiful and unconventional queen act as regent, might possibly have tipped the balance in favour of the monarchy.</p> <p>The daughter of Albert I, King of the Belgians, Marie Jos\u00e9 was related through her Wittelsbach mother, Elizabeth, to Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria and to Empress Sissi of Austria. Herself of a free-thinking and artistic disposition, she found life in the rigidly regimented court of Savoy stiflingly dull.</p> <p>A fairy-tale wedding at the Quirinale Palace in 1930 was arranged, more for the benefit of the fascist regime than for that of the monarchy. Though it produced four children, the union between the luminously beautiful young woman and the handsome Prince Umberto was only apparently happy. And Marie Jos\u00e9's friendship with anti-fascist intellectuals poisoned relations with her difficult father-in-law. \"You know, I don't have much to do with the House of Savoy,\" she confided to the journalist Indro Montanelli in 1940. \"It's not a family, it's a Frigidaire.\"</p> <p>Marie Jos\u00e9 took her royal duties seriously, serving for a while with the Red Cross in Libya. With the arrival of the second world war, she was the first - and only - member of the Savoys to appreciate that Mussolini was leading the country to ruin.</p> <p>She made contact with opponents of the regime, holding a secret meeting with Croce under the guise of an archaeological visit to Pompeii, and with the allies via Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI. She was even in contact with the Italian resistance, whom she reportedly supplied with arms and money.</p> <p>She appears to have been simultaneously attracted and repelled by Mussolini, who tolerated her political plotting as he judged it to be of no practical consequence. In a 1993 interview, she spoke of his magnetic physical presence and fierce temper. \"He was a lion. I, too, am a lion. And we both feared one another.\"</p> <p>There was no such sympathy for Hitler, who was struck by her beauty and complimented her on her eyes, \"the colour of the German sky\". She met him on a visit to Berchtesgaden in 1940 to plead for the release of food to the starving Belgians, and for a more humane treatment for her brother Leopold, who was confined to one of his castles. The answer, on all counts, was \"Nein.\"</p> <p>Having read Mein Kampf, Marie Jos\u00e9 appreciated what Hitler represented, and said she might have killed him if she had had a pistol. \"I think I would have had the strength to do it,\" she said.</p> <p>Following the abolition of the monarchy, she sailed to Portugal to await her husband. But in exile, the couple drifted apart, the ex-king remaining in Portugal, his consort living in Switzerland, ostensibly for health reasons.</p> <p>A keen painter, competent pianist and chain-smoker, Marie Jos\u00e9 devoted her maturity to travel, and to writing books about the early Savoys. Like her father, who died in a climbing accident, she loved skiing and walking in the mountains. She was a refreshingly rebellious royal, who prized her own liberty and despised her husband's deference towards his father. \"It seemed as though we were in China, with all that bowing,\" she remarked.</p> <p>She did actually visit China, her reception by Mao earning her the epithet of the \"communist queen.\" Her political views were not quite that radical, but she claimed to have learned socialism from her father, and they were sufficiently progressive to be out of tune with those of the rest of the Savoys.</p> <p>The outpouring of sympathy prompted by the death of this maverick queen may hasten the end of the constitutional ban that prevents the male heirs of the Savoy family and their consorts from returning to Italy. There is, today, no reason to fear a monarchist challenge to the republican constitution and, therefore, no reason for the prohibition. Marie Jos\u00e9 herself returned for a visit in 1988, after the government ruled that a widow could not be considered a consort and lifted the ban.</p> <p>Most of her Savoy relatives have done little to add lustre to the family reputation, and her son, Prince Victor Emmanuel, has often been his own worst enemy when it came to pleading his case with Italian public opinion.</p> <p>Marie Jos\u00e9 was an eccentric acquisition to the Savoys, and gave Italians a glimpse of an alternative monarchy with a human face.

She was attacking, or thought she was attacking, the racism implicit in the prevailing liberal view of it which suspended proper judgment and sought to raise it to the status of a masterpiece, a view which she felt to be deeply patronising. </p> <p>However, the way in which she attempted to express these views in the column brought accusations of racism, or at least of gross insensitivity, directed at her. Speaking of the performances, she had said, \"Because they were oriental, everyone presumed this was understatement, rather than woodenness.\" The script, in Chinese, was \"delivered inscrutably\". </p> <p>These and other points were picked up in a letter published three days later in the Guardian under the heading Crouching Tiger, not very well-hidden prejudices. \"Only in Britain are pundits commenting on oriental 'inscrutability',\" said the writer (a couple of letter writers agreed with the columnist's view that the film was greatly overrated). </p> <p>Several complaints about the piece were made to me. Rather more were made directly to the editor of G2 responsible for publishing the column. His view was that it was absolutely clear that the columnist's target was the assumptions, or prejudices, of British audiences. My own view is that it was not absolutely clear because it was partially obscured by the phrases complained of, which did cause real offence. </p> <p>For those with internet access, the best way to judge for yourselves is to visit the Chinese community website, <a href=\"http://www.dimsum.co.uk\">www.dimsum.co.uk</a>. This contains practically all the relevant material: the column from the Guardian, correspondence with the editor of G2, a comment from one of the co-founders of Dimsum, and an opportunity to register a vote if you thought the column in the Guardian was racist or offensive. </p> <p>Dimsum's view is, I think we can say, absolutely clear: \"Such racially insensitive opinion is not uncommon in the tabloid media. What is surprising is to find such offensive opinion in the Guardian. It is a review that shows no consideration for the feelings of the Chinese community and as such has done us a disservice.\" Not the least interesting point made is the expectation of a higher standard from the Guardian than from others. It is an expectation still, perhaps, too frequently disappointed. </p> <p>We need to pause and think a little longer to make sure that when we use the word \"inscrutable\" we free it from the racial cliche that clings to it. Its meaning is perfectly clear. Inscrutable: incomprehensible; mysterious or enigmatic (Collins Millennium dictionary).

      "body": "<p> The two most striking features of Carlos Ghosn's 15th floor office in Nissan's headquarters in Ginza are distinctly Japanese: An angry red Mount Fuji glowers from a picture hung on the north wall, where it is supposed to bring luck. </p> <p>Facing it, high on a stack of shelves on the other side of the room, is a dharma doll winking with only one eye painted in - a reminder of unfinished business, work in progress, dreams not yet fulfilled. </p> <p>Nissan's president seems quite at home among these symbols, which is hardly surprising: his upbringing and career have made him a consummate cultural chameleon. Of Lebanese heritage, he was born in Brazil and educated in France. Three of his four children were born in the United States. </p> <p>\"Home is not one particular place or country, but a collection of places in several countries,\" he says. \"For me, the greatest sin is to consider cultural difference as a problem. I see it as an opportunity.\" </p> <p>The boy from Brazil has a CV that reads like that of a Red Adair of the business world. For the past 10 years he has flown around the globe putting out increasingly large fires at multinational corporations: first at Michelin, where he rebuilt the firm's struggling North American operations, and then in Europe at Renault, where he revitalised another company that had been virtually written off. </p> <p>But Nissan has been his greatest triumph. When he took the wheel of the troubled car maker in June 1999, the company was skidding towards the scrapyard. The product line was stodgy, the management notoriously conservative, the weight of $22bn (\u00a315bn) debt was stifling growth and numerous attempts to jump-start the firm had merely flooded it with red ink. </p> <p>Enter Ghosn, who was dispatched from Renault after the French firm paid \u00a33.25bn for a 36.8% stake in the troubled Japanese company. He drove through the Nissan revival plan, a new corporate road map that was thrashed out in the whirlwind first three months of his tenure. The plan to close five factories and trim 21,000 jobs was attacked at first for its \"un-Japanese\" ruthlessness. </p> <p>Ghosn (pronounced \"gone\") admits that he had his doubts when he took up the post of chief operating officer after just one week to practice Japanese. \"I was in a country I didn't know and I had to turn this firm around,\" he recalls. \"I knew I had to give my best and maybe even that was not enough.\" </p> <p>Today, however, such uncertainties have largely been dispelled and not just in Ghosn's mind. In May, the executive expects to announce annual results that will show the company has returned to the black for the first time in seven years with growth of at least the 4.5% level targeted in the revival plan. This follows October's stunning half-year performance, when Nissan quadrupled its net profit forecast. \"At first we relied upon motivation, but now we are able to talk about precise quantitative performance. This is very important to give the plan credibility,\" says Ghosn. </p> <p>As well as impressive business figures, analysts are also starting to talk once again about Nissan style - a word that has not been associated with the company for some time. French flair was apparent on Tuesday, when Ghosn launched the sleekly redesigned Primera at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. </p> <p>\"We are starting to deliver, the wheels are now rolling in the opposite direction,\" says Ghosn. \"This is by the far the largest, fastest, most intense and most stretching operation of my professional life.\" </p> <p>As he has got used to Japan, Japan has begun to get used to him and his tough \"foreign\" methods. In Japan, he is an icon of change. The initial scepticism about his methods is being replaced by adulation. </p> <p><strong>Trendsetter </strong></p> <p>Young go-getting executives have even begun to emulate his style of dress and presentation. The changes of perception are apparent in the nicknames he has inspired. When he arrived with promises to slash factories and jobs, he was reviled as \"le cost cutter\". He says: \"I never liked the nickname - cutting costs is only part of what I am trying to do at Nissan.\" </p> <p>His ability to plough through Japan's Inc's crusty corporate culture earned him the monicker of \"the ice breaker\". Now, his admirers are more likely to call him \"7-Eleven\" for the long hours he works, which have impressed even the most workaholic Japanese. </p> <p>It is Europe where Ghosn had his foot hard on the accelerator until the announcement that Sunderland - and not a French plant - would build the Micra. Last October, the Nissan boss singled out the region as the biggest drag on the company after European operations posted a loss of \u00a3155m. The problem was that the strong pound had turned Sunderland, Europe's most productive car plant, into one of the company's biggest loss makers. </p> <p>Something would have to be done, Mr Ghosn announced darkly at the time, raising fears that he favoured building the new Micra inside the eurozone at Renault's factory in Flins, near Paris. Mr Ghosn, a dab hand at bridge, then played his trump card - the threat of 1,300 job losses near Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency - for all it was worth. </p> <p>By the time, he publicly made up his mind last Thursday, the British government and the plant's management had given him everything he wanted: a regional selective assistance grant of \u00a340m, a pledge to cut costs by 30% and a government promise to pursue a \"stable and competitive currency environment\". </p> <p>Despite forcing suppliers to bear 65% of the forex risks, Mr Ghosn came away from Britain not as le cost cutter, but as \"le job saver\". In France, nobody batted an eyelid that the Flins plant had lost out on the Micra business, prompting cynics to ask whether the factory had ever been in the running in the first place. </p> <p>Ghosn angrily denies that he finessed the British government. \"There are a lot of rumours about how much effort we made to prepare Flins, but these are based on speculation rather than fact.\" So what tipped the balance towards Sunderland? \"A convergence of factors,\" he insists, though he puts Tony Blair's consistent stance on the issue of foreign exchange rates at the top of his list. </p> <p>The decision-making process also suggests that a \u00a3230m investment was clinched by Downing Street. At a Nissan board meeting one week before the decision Ghosn said it was clear that momentum was moving Sunderland's way. </p> <p>The Nissan executives, however, did not give the plant the nod. Instead they mandated Ghosn to make a final decision after meeting the prime minister. Exactly what reassurances were given by Blair remain the subject of intense speculation, but the Nissan boss rejects claims that a promise was made by the prime minister or trade secretary Stephen Byers on when Britain would enter the single currency. \"The prime minister has said it, Mr Byers has said it and now I want to say it: There was no secret deal between Nissan and the UK,\" says Ghosn. </p> <p><strong>The road ahead </strong> </p> <p> An agreement on the single currency may not have been necessary. By the time the decision was made, the weakening of the pound and a decision to use euro for 65% of its supply purchases has already lessened the foreign exchange pain to the point where Ghosn says Nissan can start to make money again in Europe this year. </p> <p>As to the future, he predicts that there will be \"some kind of stability between the pound and the euro\" in 2002, though he evaded questions on the single currency saying that it is a \"political matter\". The prospect of a pick-up in Europe, where Ghosn hopes Nissan can expand on its \"unacceptable\" 3% market share, is timely given the slowdown in the US, where Nissan notched up its strongest growth rate of 14% last year. </p> <p>For Ghosn a world view is essential. He argues that his is a blend of management styles - not just a western-style restructuring. None of the 21,000 job cuts are being made by forced lay-offs, and employees at factories due to close are given generous grants to relocate. </p> <p>As Japan has learned, so has Ghosn. Fluent in seven languages, Nissan's president has just finished his weekly one-hour lesson in Japanese, where he says progress is slow. \"I cannot impose my childish Japanese in business discussions and this is frustrating. The president of a company must be able to communicate and that is difficult with an interpreter.\" </p> <p>But this drawback is more than offset, he says, by the fresh ideas and energy that he brought to the company as an outsider (he is careful to make the distinction with \"foreigner\"). \"This is not specific to Japanese corporate culture. When you are questioning your business system, outside help is very important.\" And not just in business either, it seems: Ghosn said he was curious to see how England's football team would fare under its first \"outside\" manager: Swede, Sven-Goran Eriksson. </p> <p>How does he choose which country's football team to follow? His answer is not only a model of global political correctness, but an indication, perhaps, of the criteria used to decide where to build the Micra. </p> <p>\"Nationalism plays a part of course, but if the team is lazy then I don't want to support them.

But as one looks through Dreyfus's own account of his sufferings (Five Years of My Life, published in 1901), the parallels become irresistible. </p> <p>Both men were high-fliers, suddenly hauled before what they saw as kangaroo courts. Both found hard and unremitting opponents lying in wait: in the case of Dreyfus, a band of bullying and unscrupulous commandants, backed up by the secret police; in Mandelson's, Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell. Both passionately asserted their innocence - Dreyfus throughout his interrogation and subsequent trial, Mandelson once it was over. Both were then banished to grim, inaccessible spots on a distant coast: Dreyfus to Devil's Island in French Guinea, on the north east coast of South America; Mandelson to the no less forbidding Hartlepool on the north-east coast of England. </p> <p>Admittedly, the privations that Dreyfus went through on the Ile du Diable may exceed anything Hartlepool has to offer. This soi-disant island was simply a barren rock which had formerly been a leper colony. Now it was cleared, except for him and his guards. They berthed him in a stone hut about 13ft square. At first he was given a space of some 200 yards for exercise, though in time that too was taken away from him. </p> <p>As I say, the efforts of Zola (a part played in this present case by Harris) finally righted this wretched injustice. Dreyfus was restored to the rank of staff officer 12 years after his conviction and in time for the first world war; on which basis Mandelson ought to be back in Stormont some time in 2013. The man chiefly responsible for cooking up the case against Dreyfus killed himself out of remorse. </p> <p> <strong>Next week in Smallweed: </strong> Is Peter the new Count of Monte Cristo? by Jeffrey Archer. </p> <p> <strong>So what</strong> exactly is a kangaroo court? You may choose one of two answers. 1) A court composed of kangaroos sitting in judgment on fellow marsupials. (I'd go for that if I were you: it's much the simpler). 2) A late-19th-century US term, meaning a court constituted without legal standing, for instance by strikers, prisoners or mutineers. How kangaroos got into this concept seems to me far from clear, but you know how agile they are. Some books say the connection occurred because of the way that kangaroos jump - in a headstrong and arbitrary way, I suppose they mean. Others aver that the expression arose because kangaroos are such cruel beasts. I find this surprising: I always thought of them as cuddly creatures with pouches, more likely to let you off with a caution than impose some ferocious arbitrary sentence. But then one should never judge by appearances. </p> <p> <strong>There was</strong> heartening news this week for admirers of the composer Gustav Holst. Apparently the planet Pluto is thought by some good judges not to be a real planet at all. It ought to be degraded, they say, to the rank of comet. If so, this would vindicate the judgment of Holst in keeping his suite, The Planets, to the number he started out with. People offered Holst the chance to expand the work after Pluto swam into the general consciousness round about 1930, four years before he died. \"Look here, Holst, old chap,\" they told him, \"we seem to have found this new planet. Wouldn't you like to tag it on to your suite?\" \"Thanks very much,\" Holst replied, \"but I think I'll stick to the suite as it stands, if you don't mind.\" (I paraphrase, but not much.) </p> <p>And thus things continued till the final days of the 20th century, when the composer Colin Matthews, at the invitation of Kent Nagano and the Hall\u00e9, added a Pluto, which was first performed in Manchester last May. To much acclaim, it has to be said, though Smallweed continued to think that Matthews was taking a liberty. This was not, after all, like Mahler's 10th or Bartok's third piano concerto, a work which had to be completed by others because the composer died. Holst was still around and said no, and that should have been the end of the matter. Thank goodness for science, which now seems likely to relegate Pluto to some brand new suite called The Comets. </p> <p> <strong>There's one</strong> source on which the steelworkers about to be sacked by Corus can surely depend for a sympathetic hearing. The Daily Telegraph, not always over the years a source of compassion for people in dying industries, has lately developed a pretty compassion for those who fall victim to modernisation. Its pages over the past year or so have regularly been full of understanding accounts of such people's predicaments, especially where their skills are irrelevant to other forms of employment, or where job cuts occur in places where no other work is available. True, virtually all of this coverage has been concerned with those who would suffer if blood sports were banned. But surely the Telegraph will be no less generous now to the apprehensions and fears of communities such as Llanwern? Just because its editor is a fanatical huntsman, rather than a fanatical steelworker (there are not so many of those in my trade nowadays), he wouldn't want to condone double standards, would he? Of course not. </p> <p> <strong>Moved perhaps</strong> by the example of John Adams's celebrated orchestral piece, The Chairman Dances, BBC television the other night invented a sequel which might have been called The Ombudsman Prances. The parliamentary ombudsman, Elizabeth Filkin, who is involved in investigations featuring Keith Vaz, was pictured advancing past parliament in a kangaroid fashion, as if bouncing from step to step. Maybe this was simply the product of slow-motion filming, though it looked to Smallweed as if technicians lying in wait for her had adroitly carpeted Parliament Square with miniature trampolines. It made her, I have to say, look a trifle ridiculous. But it made the BBC look very silly indeed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Smallweed@theguardian.com\">Smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>One of the most evil partnerships in British criminal history was brought to justice yesterday when the serial killer and rapist David Mulcahy was jailed for life after his former accomplice finally testified against him.</p> <p>Married father-of-four Mulcahy and his friend, John Duffy, murdered three women - the youngest only 15 - and raped another seven during a \"reign of terror\".</p> <p>Duffy was jailed for his part in the attacks in 1988, but though police were convinced that Mulcahy was his partner, he remained free. Duffy finally admitted to a prison psychologist that his schoolboy friend was his accomplice.</p> <p>Detectives last night said there could be more victims of the pair who had yet to come forward. And they were not ruling out the possibility that Mulcahy may have continued to attack women after Duffy was jailed. Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy said: \"There may be victims of Mulcahy in relation to single attacks.\" At least one woman has come forward to say she was raped by Mulcahy alone.</p> <p>Mulcahy, 41, was given three life sentences for the murders. He received 24-year jail terms on each of seven rapes he committed with Duffy, and 18 years each for five conspiracies to rape.</p> <p>He was convicted after Duffy, who has been told he will die in prison, spent 14 days in the witness box describing their crimes to an Old Bailey jury. It was the first time a Category A inmate had testified against a co-defendant.</p> <p>During the five-month trial the court heard that the pair, whose relationship was described as \"unique but wicked\", played the Michael Jackson track Thriller on the car stereo as they went on \"hunting\" expeditions for lone women to rape in the 1980s.</p> <p>They terrorised their victims with threats and became ever more violent until eventually they killed. Mulcahy was said to have enjoyed \"playing God\" with their victims.</p> <p>Duffy, 41, who was dubbed the \"railway rapist\" because so many of the crimes were committed near stations, was convicted of two murders and five rapes. He said he could not remember his crimes, and police did not have enough evidence to charge his accomplice.</p> <p>For 18 years after his first offence, Mulcahy continued to live an apparently normal life with his wife and children in north London. Then recent advances in scientific techniques, coupled with Duffy's decision to name his partner, allowed him to be put on trial.</p> <p>There were gasps from the public gallery when the jury returned its unanimous verdicts after deliberating for five days. Three of the victims hugged each other. Others were too upset to attend.</p> <p>Judge Michael Hyam, the recorder of London, said the murders had been \"sadistic killings.\" He told Mulcahy: \"Of the two of you, I have no doubt it was you who derived gratification from the act of killing. These were acts of desolating wickedness. You descended to the depths of depravity in carrying them out.\"</p> <p>Detectives said afterwards that the science which had allowed them to match Mulcahy's DNA profile to material found after one of the attacks, and to discover a fingerprint linking him to another crime scene, had not been available at the time of Duffy's trial.</p> <p>However, there was strong criticism from one rape victim, who said she had to approach the police four times before they even took a statement from her.</p> <p>Detectives said there could be more victims who had been too frightened to come forward. One of the pair's tactics had been to obtain personal information from their victims to dissuade them from going to the police.</p> <p>The police will now work with the national crime faculty to re-examine any unsolved murders or rapes which the pair may have been responsible for. The original inquiry looked at 68 sex attacks suspected of being linked. The detectives will also speak to officers working on Operation Enigma, a review of around 100 unsolved violent crimes.</p> <p>After the verdicts, Mulcahy's wife Sandra insisted: \"David is innocent. I will fight on to prove him innocent.\"</p> <p>Mulcahy, a builder, of Chalk Farm, north London, had denied raping and murdering three women during 1985 and 1986. Alison Day, 19, was strangled at Hackney Wick, east London, on December 29 1985. Schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was strangled near her home in Horsley, Surrey, on April 17 1986. Newly married Anne Lock, 29, was killed - probably suffocated - as she returned home to Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Mulcahy also denied seven other rapes and five charges of conspiracy to rape between 1982 and 1985.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most evil partnerships in British criminal history was brought to justice yesterday when the serial killer and rapist David Mulcahy was jailed for life after his former accomplice finally testified against him. Married father-of-four Mulcahy and his friend, John Duffy, murdered three women - the youngest only 15 - and raped another seven during a \"reign of terror\". Duffy was jailed for his part in the attacks in 1988, but though police were convinced that Mulcahy was his partner, he remained free. Duffy finally admitted to a prison psychologist that his schoolboy friend was his accomplice. Detectives last night said there could be more victims of the pair who had yet to come forward. And they were not ruling out the possibility that Mulcahy may have continued to attack women after Duffy was jailed. Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy said: \"There may be victims of Mulcahy in relation to single attacks.\" At least one woman has come forward to say she was raped by Mulcahy alone. Mulcahy, 41, was given three life sentences for the murders. He received 24-year jail terms on each of seven rapes he committed with Duffy, and 18 years each for five conspiracies to rape. He was convicted after Duffy, who has been told he will die in prison, spent 14 days in the witness box describing their crimes to an Old Bailey jury. It was the first time a Category A inmate had testified against a co-defendant. During the five-month trial the court heard that the pair, whose relationship was described as \"unique but wicked\", played the Michael Jackson track Thriller on the car stereo as they went on \"hunting\" expeditions for lone women to rape in the 1980s. They terrorised their victims with threats and became ever more violent until eventually they killed. Mulcahy was said to have enjoyed \"playing God\" with their victims. Duffy, 41, who was dubbed the \"railway rapist\" because so many of the crimes were committed near stations, was convicted of two murders and five rapes. He said he could not remember his crimes, and police did not have enough evidence to charge his accomplice. For 18 years after his first offence, Mulcahy continued to live an apparently normal life with his wife and children in north London. Then recent advances in scientific techniques, coupled with Duffy's decision to name his partner, allowed him to be put on trial. There were gasps from the public gallery when the jury returned its unanimous verdicts after deliberating for five days. Three of the victims hugged each other. Others were too upset to attend. Judge Michael Hyam, the recorder of London, said the murders had been \"sadistic killings.\" He told Mulcahy: \"Of the two of you, I have no doubt it was you who derived gratification from the act of killing. These were acts of desolating wickedness. You descended to the depths of depravity in carrying them out.\" Detectives said afterwards that the science which had allowed them to match Mulcahy's DNA profile to material found after one of the attacks, and to discover a fingerprint linking him to another crime scene, had not been available at the time of Duffy's trial. However, there was strong criticism from one rape victim, who said she had to approach the police four times before they even took a statement from her. Detectives said there could be more victims who had been too frightened to come forward. One of the pair's tactics had been to obtain personal information from their victims to dissuade them from going to the police. The police will now work with the national crime faculty to re-examine any unsolved murders or rapes which the pair may have been responsible for. The original inquiry looked at 68 sex attacks suspected of being linked. The detectives will also speak to officers working on Operation Enigma, a review of around 100 unsolved violent crimes. After the verdicts, Mulcahy's wife Sandra insisted: \"David is innocent. I will fight on to prove him innocent.\" Mulcahy, a builder, of Chalk Farm, north London, had denied raping and murdering three women during 1985 and 1986. Alison Day, 19, was strangled at Hackney Wick, east London, on December 29 1985. Schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer, 15, was strangled near her home in Horsley, Surrey, on April 17 1986. Newly married Anne Lock, 29, was killed - probably suffocated - as she returned home to Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire. Mulcahy also denied seven other rapes and five charges of conspiracy to rape between 1982 and 1985.",

Leaders of the FNV union yesterday told Corus's Dutch management in Amsterdam that workers at the group's Ijmuiden plant on the North Sea coast would not undertake work previously done in Wales and other parts of the UK. Corus insisted it did not intend switching production to Ijmuiden, but admitted that it intended to replace loss-making UK exports to continental customers with \"profitable\" output from the Dutch plant. Ijmuiden's output of such products, used in the car and domestic appliance industries, is due to rise by 1.3m tonnes a year while its overall production of steel should go up from 6.3m tonnes to nearer 7m tonnes. The move came as the European commissioner for re gional aid, Michael Barnier, offered to refocus EU aid to help create jobs in Wales, which is bearing the brunt of Corus's cuts. But Tony Blair, in a speech setting out the limits of the state's role in fostering British manufacturing, ruled out large-scale intervention to save steel jobs. He said businesses must succeed or fail on their own strengths. He said jobs were lost as well as created in dynamic economies, but pointed out that overall employment in the UK continued to rise. The executive of the main UK steel union, the ISTC, said it was working with the government and other unions on a package that could save most of the jobs under threat. It refused to give details but insiders said it was \"solid\". Meanwhile, the AEEU union has drawn up a plan which envisages Corus agreeing to mothball plants such as Llanwern, Ebbw Vale and parts of Shotton and Redcar until better trading prospects, helped by a weaker pound, enable it to revive them. Corus has agreed to listen to union counter-proposals during the two-week moratorium before redundancies and closures are set in train, but has indicated that it is unlikely to change its mind. Neil Kinnock, vice-president of the European commission, said: \"There's a moral to be drawn when we've got the pound 25% overvalued.

She said Mr Barnier was ready to discuss proposals from the Welsh assembly and other regional organisations for refocusing existing EU aid programmes on the stricken areas. Corus's Ebbw Vale and Llanwern plants are within areas targeted by the EU for aid under the structural funds - currently totalling \u00a31.23bn over a seven-year period that began last year. Wales also benefits from European social fund money, which could be used to help retrain the redundant workforce from the Shotton plant.

His roof terrace offers a dazzling view of an apparent jumble of warehousing and wasteground, a scene of brutal slate-grey beauty. It is the perfect view for one of the great urban enthusiasts of our age. </p> <p>Chicagoan by birth, New Yorker by temperament, Sennett has settled in London only recently. Now 58, he took up the post of school professor of social and cultural theory at the London School of Economics in 1999. But he is a great deal more than a senior working, writing, administering sociologist. He is also a successful public intellectual, one of that special breed of writers and thinkers who cover a range of so-called specialisms but are called upon to tell us as a society who we are and how we got here. </p> <p> Chiefly known for his elegant and scholarly writing, Sennett has produced a dozen books, including three novels, since the late 60s, mostly on aspects of the urban experience and the interconnection between authority, modernism and public life. His knowledge spans the disciplines of architecture, design, music, art, literature, history, and political and economic theory, but he adds to all that a rare anthropological hunger for the details of human experience. One of his apparent paradoxes is that while he so fiercely argues for a more disciplined form of public life over any therapeutic-style navel-gazing, he possesses a rare genius for getting into other people's heads and hearts. </p> <p> He is also a socialist, who has returned to radical politics in late middle age. Ruth Levitas, reader in sociology at the University of Bristol, says he thinks class is important and fundamental, \"which lots of people don't, but he also talks about what class means for real lives without drifting off into stuff about identity. He also writes beautifully\". </p> <p> It may be his politics or it may be the complex and wide-ranging nature of his enthusiasms which bring him just short of celebrity intellectual status. The author Victoria Glendinning, a friend for more than 25 years, says of his work, \"It really ought to be better known. I will sometimes read some work of social theory and want to say, 'Oh, well, Richard said that'. His work isn't always as acknowledged as it should be because he's not just a sociologist but also a novelist, so his work doesn't fit into any easy slot. It is kind of uncategorisable and all the better for it.\" </p> <p> But Sennett's work can also be understood as a life-long attempt to come to terms with his radical heritage, to both honour the idealism of an old left and re-mould it in the light of contemporary realities. Born in Chicago in 1943, he was a classic child of the left. His father and all his uncles were in the Communist party and his mother \"was always involved in the labour movement\", he says. His father and uncle fought in the Spanish Civil War, first against the fascists, and then against the communists. Proudly he shows me a portrait on his study wall of the Lincoln section of the International brigade. It includes his father and uncle, upright men in caps prepared to die to defend someone else's freedom. </p> <p> His parents were together for only a few months after his birth. His father returned to Spain, to be with a fellow freedom fighter with whom he had fallen in love. He later became a translator of Spanish and popular Catalan poetry, which Sennett describes as \"his one great love\". Sennett never met him, although as child of a volunteer in the civil war, he was offered Spanish citizenship in 1988. But he did keep in touch with his uncle, William Sennett, who left the Communist party in 1958 and became boss of a transportation company while never losing his radical politics. Sennett was raised alone by his mother, Dorothy, whom he describes as a \"remarkable woman and a fantastic writer. She had wanted to be a writer in the 30s but after my father left she was down on her luck and her dream was shattered.\" </p> <p> She later became a distinguished social worker, an occupation she took up, says Sennett, \"to arm her against pity\". Now 91, and still living in the States, she continued to write until a few years ago. From the mid to late 40s mother and son lived on the Cabrini Green public housing project in Chicago, notorious for its poverty and violence. In book to be published by Penguin, provisionally entitled Socialism: An Essay On Honour And Dishonour, Sennett describes Cabrini Green, which was built during the second world war, as a \"mixed community of blacks, the wounded, and the deranged (which) defined all-too tangibly what it meant to be left behind during the post-war boom\". </p> <p> A certain number of places were reserved for the white poor. In the so called \"glass wars\" black and white youths would sling sheets of broken glass across the street at each other. A young black girl nearly died of cuts to her neck. Yet, as Sennett has since written, this dangerous pursuit was more about the dubious satisfactions of gang warfare than racial revenge. The poor whites saw paternalistic social workers as part of the same threatening \"them\" as their black neighbours. </p> <p>The Sennetts lived in two rooms with a bath, but were to some extent isolated from the wider \"screaming, laughing, wailing, shouting life\" of the housing projects. Playing the cello at six and composing at eight, living in a flat filled with books, the serious young boy could see a way out. \"We had a tough time financially, but in the bohemian, radical milieu in which we lived, we were just another family,\" he says. \"It had a curious class composition, this world. Most were Jewish, but it was a cultural milieu, not an ethnic one.\" </p> <p>Sennett still remembers at school, \"seeing a couple of men in a car watching me play. They wanted to find out who my playmates were. I think they assumed they could get into a network of activities through me. McCarthyism produced a horrible period in American history.\" By 13 Sennett was already performing in public. He was driven in a little VW bus to play Bach cantatas to exhausted miners in a small town in Minnesota, \"people who had never heard classical music before. It was wonderful.\" It was also on a visit to France to perform that he learned to speak the language fluently and began to make contacts with influential artistic and intellectual figures such as Pierre Boulez and Michel Foucault. </p> <p>Sennett's hopes of becoming a professional cellist were dashed in 1962, when he developed a form of carpal tunnel syndrome. A disastrous hand operation made his condition worse. His performing career was over. But then the Harvard sociologist David Riesman invited him to Harvard to \"figure out what you want to do\". It was, Sennett says, a lot easier to get into Harvard in those days. He was then caught up \"in all this political stuff, in the 60s\". He also discovered that with the help of an electric typewriter he could write painlessly. \"I can still recall the joy of being able to do something expressive that wasn't physically painful.\"</p> <p> Sennett began teaching at Yale in the late 60s. In the early 70s he went to New York University, where he later set up the influential New York Institute of the Humanities. The young sociologist made his name with his first two books, The Uses Of Disorder, a study of the effect of city life on personal identity, and The Hidden Injuries Of Class, written with Jonathan Cobb, a study of working-class confusion about self and status in a more affluent world. </p> <p>Sennett and Cobb had set out to understand why an \"increase in material power and freedom of choice should be accompanied by a crisis in self respect\". Sennett says now that they were innocents. \"Sociologists traditionally tended towards opinion surveys. We conducted the work rather as an anthropologist might have done. And we began with completely the wrong intuition, as I so often do in my work. I think it's going to be about politics and outer-world stuff, about economics. But it is often people talking out their subjectivity. In The Hidden Injuries Of Class, people are ashamed that they're not middle class, even though they have contempt for that class. </p> <p> \"In The Corrosion Of Character, published in 1998, the class issue is somewhat effaced and it is more about the long term organisation of one's activity, the narrative of one's own life, rather than one's relation to others. In both cases, though, the issue is lack of mastery over one's life.\" </p> <p> The Hidden Injuries Of Class still makes fascinating reading, largely because of its sensitive and subtle exploration of working-class lives. It dissects the ways in which doctrines of equality may work against most people in the modern world; with inherited social distinctions now apparently erased, \"social difference can now appear as a question of character, of moral resolve, will and competence\". It is an argument which has as much resonance in the age of so-called depressed affluence as it had 30 years ago. </p> <p> It was clear from these early books that Sennett was a skillful writer. At its best, his sociology reads like a subtle, psychological novel, an absorbing biography or a piece of really good journalism. It amply fulfils his claim to be \"a report on the act of thinking\". His aim, he says, is to make sociology a form of literature, \"as it was in the 19th century. This question of style is a huge issue in sociology,\" he says. \"There's a great gap between politics and expression. So many academics are closed, anxious about performance and status. Foucault wrote in clear evocative French, but his followers have a possessive obscurity. Roland Barthes was a wonderful writer but there is a paralysis about his acolytes.\" </p> <p> In 1974 Sennett published what was to become probably his best known book, The Fall Of Public Man, a study of changing forms of public and city life which was also a powerful argument for a more formal public culture and a swipe against the rise of a self-indulgent counter-culture. \"Masses of people are concerned with their single life histories and particular emotion as never before; this concern has proved to be a trap rather than a liberation,\" he wrote. Given that each self is \"in some measure a cabinet of horrors, civilised relations between selves can only proceed to the extent that nasty little secrets of desire, greed or envy are kept locked up\". </p> <p> Homi Bhabha, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, first met Sennett only a few years ago, but as early as 1980 or 1981, he says, \"a colleague had urged me to read The Fall Of Public Man. It was a book I'd flirted with but never really read. I realised that it brought in a whole range of social and intellectual interests and experience. </p> <p>It was completely different from the evaluative, numerical view of experience of his number-crunching contemporaries. If I had to sum up Richard's work, I would say he is always interested in the relation between authority and experience.\" But the book was not without its critics. The radical commentator Russell Jacoby described it as \"diffuse, vague, uncritical. Few pages attain clarity; few seem crafted.\" In Sennett's intellectual world, says Jacoby, \"everyone adds a little piece to the story; everyone points out, reminds, or discovers something Sennett finds interesting. The pluralism and graciousness are estimable but also costly. Sennett nods to and compliments everyone he encounters. The warm collegiality that flows through his books douses the spark of ideas.\" </p> <p> Such \"warm collegiality\" may have found its perfect expression in the New York Institute of Humanities, which Sennett co-founded and ran from the late 70s. He describes the institute as \"an effort to create a 'town-gown' intellectual centre in new York, combining academia, the worlds of publishing and writing, musicians, diplomats, journalists, politicians, painters... a kind of All Souls with lousy food and lots of good talk\".</p> <p> Sennett ran the institute with the writer Edmund White, and its first fellows included Susan Sontag, Joseph Brodsky, Thomas Kuhn and Michel Foucault. White later wrote the experience up in his book Caracole as the \"chat shop\". Sennett says, \"We did chat but we also supported a lot of starving intellectuals.\" It was in the mid to late 80s that Sennett also published three novels, The Frog That Dared To Croak, An Evening With Brahms, and Palais Royal, which were undertaken partly as a way \"of recovering my word craft\".</p> <p> City life, with its promise of anonymity and community, is one of the great loves of Sennett's life. In The Uses Of Disorder he observes that \"the city alone can make us conscious of a kind of equilibrium of disorder... the enemies lose their clear image, because every day one sees so many people who are alien but are all alien in the same way\". Much of his later work, such as The Conscience Of The Eye, (1990) and Flesh And Stone, (1994) are attempts to trace the history between humans and the built environment. </p> <p> The architect Richard Rogers, who has known Sennett for 15 years, says, \"We are very much on the same intellectual wavelength. Richard believes in the importance of the public domain, that people should have direct involvement in relation to public space and buildings. We are both interested in sustainable development and the role of cities in a civil society.\" </p> <p>City life also fosters the kind of intense but unclaustrophobic friendships that Sennett thrives on. \"He has a near genius for contacts and friendship,\" says Victoria Glendinning. LSE director Anthony Giddens describes Sennett as \"very lively, well-connected, good at talking to people. He has always had a wider coverage than the rest of us.\" Such friends describe Sennett as full of plans and curiosity, \"always building castles in the air... some of which he will make happen\" and as a good cook and generous host. </p> <p> \"Richard has the most astonishing ability to re-invent himself. He must be in about his fifth life by now,\" says the writer and old friend Marina Warner. However, on his private life, Sennett is guarded to a point of gracious stubbornness. He first married in 1968, the marriage being annulled later that year. He says only \"I married very young and I divorced young.\" He was married again between 1974-78. He is more forthcoming on his present marriage to Saskia Sassen, 53, a formidable academic in her own right whom he met in New York in the early 80s and to whom he has been married for 14 years. Sassen, a specialist on the global economy, holds chairs in sociology at the University of Chicago and in political economy at the LSE. Sennett says \"Saskia and I write about many of the same things. People imagine our pillow talk is all about the global economy. Well it isn't, well not much.\" Richard Rogers describes the couple as a \"very interesting twosome, overlapping in their interests, but specialising in different areas. They are a powerhouse, but a very nice, humanist powerhouse.\" </p> <p>Glendinning tells a story about the couple staying at a mutual friend's country house. The host told her that after everyone had gone to bed, peals of laughter were heard coming from their bedroom. Glendinning thinks that \"for a couple who are apart an awful lot of the time, it works very well when they are together\". Sennett, who has no children of his own, is by all accounts a devoted stepfather to Saskia's only son, Hilary, 25, a sculptor in New York. </p> <p> Sennett's alliance with Sassen may have prompted him to the more international and economic emphasis of The Corrosion Of Character, published in 1998, a lucid study of the insecurities of the new economy and the ways in which it has warped the qualities of loyalty, trust, commitment and self-discipline. It is vintage Sennett, moving easily between 19th century political theory and 20th century interview and reportage. There is a masterly if somewhat ambiguous account of a visit to Davos, the Swiss resort that hosts the annual meeting of world business and political leaders. Here, one can almost feel Sennett torn between his sympathy and admiration for the skills of global leaders and an emotion bordering on contempt fortheir \"ethical neutrality\".</p> <p>But if he is rarely critical of individuals, he holds nothing back in his criticism of the new economy in which \"to make it you really have to plunge into much more superficial social relations. It is dysfunctional to feel loyalty to an organisation. The notion of accumulating a life history with an institution or a person doesn't work in this economy. The boom gave people the impression that the class divide was going to end - that there would be no losers. In fact, it has made it worse.\" </p> <p> He is currently overseeing a research project in New York which involves interviewing young people in their 20s, who have gone into financial services, IT and the new media. They are confused, he says: \"Everyone thinks they are going to be the next Martha Lane Fox but they are learning very quickly that all these fantasy worlds just aren't going to happen. Don't commit, don't be dependent, stay loose. Loyalty is very low on this list. But if you think dependence is bad, what you produce is a damaged human being.\" </p> <p>Ruth Levitas of the University of Bristol describes The Corrosion Of Character as a \"wonderful description of the way in which insecure work has taken away the basics for a certain kind of character\". But she also thinks there's something about the thesis \"that doesn't work in relation to women, something that's not quite right. Ultimately, I felt the book doesn't address gender\".</p> <p>Sennett has, he says \"a complicated relationship with my country, an incredible ambivalence. I am uneasy when I am outside New York. The United States is very rich, but not very realistic. All the good things in US life are hidden while what is on the surface is stupid. America probably has the most sustained set of voluntary social relationships, charitable groups and citizen participation. Yet most small-town Americans have political attitudes to the right of Atilla the Hun. It's a real conundrum.\" The Corrosion Of Character was a bestseller in Germany, which may contribute to a feeling in some quarters that Sennett is \"an American read by Europeans\". </p> <p>In his work in progress, Socialism: An Essay On Honour And Dishonour, he attempts to find a place for socialism after communism, \"in particular to understand what notions of dependence and mutuality mean in the context of capitalism which is really focused on issues of individual competence\". Even New Labour, which he broadly supports, \"fosters this impossible image of a kind of New Labour superman\". </p> <p> In middle age, Sennett says he has returned to his political roots. \"I started out in the 60s when it was pretty fevered on the left. And then I moved right in reaction to all the bullshit of the counter- culture. I got fed up with that anti intellectualism, the rejection of serious ideas, of serious art and the measurement of reality by psychological categories of the moment, an emphasis on immediate gratification.\"</p> <p> The Fall Of Public Man was anti-psychological, an anti-touchy-feely book and in American terms, that was anti-radical. But the error he made, he says, was to draw political consequences from his rejection of the counter-culture... a trajectory that has finally brought him back to the left. \"This genetic socialism reasserted itself and I've returned to overtly writing about socialism. In America, I voted Green at the last election for the simple reason that it has become a party with a single overarching ideal - electoral reform, which means ending the private funding of politics in the US. </p> <p> \"Even when I had this period of disillusion with the cultural left, I still voted Socialist Worker. I voted for the party not in one of its Trotskyist phases, which I hated, but in one of its Green, multicultural, pluralist phases, which I like.\" He talks about meeting President Clinton, who said to him\"It's always good to meet an intelligent Democrat.\" \"When I told him I voted Socialist Worker the famous Clinton smile froze.\" </p> <p> Sennett lives most of the year in London, returning to the States for three months. Sassen similarly divides her time between the two countries. Although Sennett describes London as \"our emotional base\" he appears genuinely outraged at \"the degree of bureaucratic micro-management in [British] academia. My colleagues, particularly the younger ones, are very depressed by it. Academics are constantly filling out forms, their emails can be looked at by the government. In America, there is far more appreciation of academics than in official Britain. Here there is an institutionalised contempt which makes it hard to do good work.\"</p> <p> At the same time he describes his students here, \"as the best I've ever had\". Sennett claims he has written enough. He would like to end his days as he began them, as a professional performer or possibly running a music festival, maybe somewhere like the Wigmore Hall in London. When he has finished the current book on socialism, \"I have probably only one book left in me. I would like to do something on the sociology of performing.\" </p> <p> Music remains his great love and he has returned to playing the cello after several operations on his hand. \"The ability to play again is one of the greatest gifts middle age has brought me.\" He plays in a small chamber group, with, among others, the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, on clarinet. But the popular reception for a work like The Corrosion Of Character suggests there is a hunger out there for the informed, exploratory, and in some ways gentle anti-capitalism that Sennett represents. With his grasp of history, his sympathy for the radical cause, his understanding of city life and his own professional success, he is one of the few writers who can puncture the pretensions and false hopes of the New Economy with some authority. </p> <p>He was also one of the first writers to predict, again with admirable restraint, the economic and political turbulence that may lie ahead. For, as the chilling last line of the Corrosion Of Character observes, a regime \"which provides human beings no deep reasons to care about one another cannot long preserve its legitimacy\".</p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: </strong>Richard Sennett </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> January 1 1943, Chicago. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Breck School; University of Chicago; Juilliard Conservatory New York (external student); Harvard University. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> First married 1968 (annulled 68); Caroline Rand Herron 74-78; Saskia Sassen 87. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Yale University, lecturer 68-70; Brandeis University, asst. professor 70-72; New York University, professor 72-98.

      "bodyText": "Richard Sennett enjoys the nearest to loft-style living that central London offers. His spacious, almost surreally well-ordered flat tops a maze of Farringdon offices. His roof terrace offers a dazzling view of an apparent jumble of warehousing and wasteground, a scene of brutal slate-grey beauty. It is the perfect view for one of the great urban enthusiasts of our age. Chicagoan by birth, New Yorker by temperament, Sennett has settled in London only recently. Now 58, he took up the post of school professor of social and cultural theory at the London School of Economics in 1999. But he is a great deal more than a senior working, writing, administering sociologist. He is also a successful public intellectual, one of that special breed of writers and thinkers who cover a range of so-called specialisms but are called upon to tell us as a society who we are and how we got here. Chiefly known for his elegant and scholarly writing, Sennett has produced a dozen books, including three novels, since the late 60s, mostly on aspects of the urban experience and the interconnection between authority, modernism and public life. His knowledge spans the disciplines of architecture, design, music, art, literature, history, and political and economic theory, but he adds to all that a rare anthropological hunger for the details of human experience. One of his apparent paradoxes is that while he so fiercely argues for a more disciplined form of public life over any therapeutic-style navel-gazing, he possesses a rare genius for getting into other people's heads and hearts. He is also a socialist, who has returned to radical politics in late middle age. Ruth Levitas, reader in sociology at the University of Bristol, says he thinks class is important and fundamental, \"which lots of people don't, but he also talks about what class means for real lives without drifting off into stuff about identity.

The radical commentator Russell Jacoby described it as \"diffuse, vague, uncritical. Few pages attain clarity; few seem crafted.\" In Sennett's intellectual world, says Jacoby, \"everyone adds a little piece to the story; everyone points out, reminds, or discovers something Sennett finds interesting. The pluralism and graciousness are estimable but also costly. Sennett nods to and compliments everyone he encounters. The warm collegiality that flows through his books douses the spark of ideas.\" Such \"warm collegiality\" may have found its perfect expression in the New York Institute of Humanities, which Sennett co-founded and ran from the late 70s. He describes the institute as \"an effort to create a 'town-gown' intellectual centre in new York, combining academia, the worlds of publishing and writing, musicians, diplomats, journalists, politicians, painters... a kind of All Souls with lousy food and lots of good talk\". Sennett ran the institute with the writer Edmund White, and its first fellows included Susan Sontag, Joseph Brodsky, Thomas Kuhn and Michel Foucault. White later wrote the experience up in his book Caracole as the \"chat shop\". Sennett says, \"We did chat but we also supported a lot of starving intellectuals.\" It was in the mid to late 80s that Sennett also published three novels, The Frog That Dared To Croak, An Evening With Brahms, and Palais Royal, which were undertaken partly as a way \"of recovering my word craft\". City life, with its promise of anonymity and community, is one of the great loves of Sennett's life. In The Uses Of Disorder he observes that \"the city alone can make us conscious of a kind of equilibrium of disorder... the enemies lose their clear image, because every day one sees so many people who are alien but are all alien in the same way\". Much of his later work, such as The Conscience Of The Eye, (1990) and Flesh And Stone, (1994) are attempts to trace the history between humans and the built environment. The architect Richard Rogers, who has known Sennett for 15 years, says, \"We are very much on the same intellectual wavelength. Richard believes in the importance of the public domain, that people should have direct involvement in relation to public space and buildings. We are both interested in sustainable development and the role of cities in a civil society.\" City life also fosters the kind of intense but unclaustrophobic friendships that Sennett thrives on. \"He has a near genius for contacts and friendship,\" says Victoria Glendinning. LSE director Anthony Giddens describes Sennett as \"very lively, well-connected, good at talking to people. He has always had a wider coverage than the rest of us.\" Such friends describe Sennett as full of plans and curiosity, \"always building castles in the air... some of which he will make happen\" and as a good cook and generous host. \"Richard has the most astonishing ability to re-invent himself. He must be in about his fifth life by now,\" says the writer and old friend Marina Warner. However, on his private life, Sennett is guarded to a point of gracious stubbornness. He first married in 1968, the marriage being annulled later that year. He says only \"I married very young and I divorced young.\" He was married again between 1974-78. He is more forthcoming on his present marriage to Saskia Sassen, 53, a formidable academic in her own right whom he met in New York in the early 80s and to whom he has been married for 14 years. Sassen, a specialist on the global economy, holds chairs in sociology at the University of Chicago and in political economy at the LSE. Sennett says \"Saskia and I write about many of the same things. People imagine our pillow talk is all about the global economy. Well it isn't, well not much.\" Richard Rogers describes the couple as a \"very interesting twosome, overlapping in their interests, but specialising in different areas. They are a powerhouse, but a very nice, humanist powerhouse.\" Glendinning tells a story about the couple staying at a mutual friend's country house. The host told her that after everyone had gone to bed, peals of laughter were heard coming from their bedroom. Glendinning thinks that \"for a couple who are apart an awful lot of the time, it works very well when they are together\". Sennett, who has no children of his own, is by all accounts a devoted stepfather to Saskia's only son, Hilary, 25, a sculptor in New York. Sennett's alliance with Sassen may have prompted him to the more international and economic emphasis of The Corrosion Of Character, published in 1998, a lucid study of the insecurities of the new economy and the ways in which it has warped the qualities of loyalty, trust, commitment and self-discipline. It is vintage Sennett, moving easily between 19th century political theory and 20th century interview and reportage. There is a masterly if somewhat ambiguous account of a visit to Davos, the Swiss resort that hosts the annual meeting of world business and political leaders. Here, one can almost feel Sennett torn between his sympathy and admiration for the skills of global leaders and an emotion bordering on contempt fortheir \"ethical neutrality\". But if he is rarely critical of individuals, he holds nothing back in his criticism of the new economy in which \"to make it you really have to plunge into much more superficial social relations. It is dysfunctional to feel loyalty to an organisation. The notion of accumulating a life history with an institution or a person doesn't work in this economy. The boom gave people the impression that the class divide was going to end - that there would be no losers. In fact, it has made it worse.\" He is currently overseeing a research project in New York which involves interviewing young people in their 20s, who have gone into financial services, IT and the new media. They are confused, he says: \"Everyone thinks they are going to be the next Martha Lane Fox but they are learning very quickly that all these fantasy worlds just aren't going to happen. Don't commit, don't be dependent, stay loose. Loyalty is very low on this list. But if you think dependence is bad, what you produce is a damaged human being.\" Ruth Levitas of the University of Bristol describes The Corrosion Of Character as a \"wonderful description of the way in which insecure work has taken away the basics for a certain kind of character\". But she also thinks there's something about the thesis \"that doesn't work in relation to women, something that's not quite right. Ultimately, I felt the book doesn't address gender\". Sennett has, he says \"a complicated relationship with my country, an incredible ambivalence. I am uneasy when I am outside New York. The United States is very rich, but not very realistic. All the good things in US life are hidden while what is on the surface is stupid. America probably has the most sustained set of voluntary social relationships, charitable groups and citizen participation. Yet most small-town Americans have political attitudes to the right of Atilla the Hun. It's a real conundrum.\" The Corrosion Of Character was a bestseller in Germany, which may contribute to a feeling in some quarters that Sennett is \"an American read by Europeans\". In his work in progress, Socialism: An Essay On Honour And Dishonour, he attempts to find a place for socialism after communism, \"in particular to understand what notions of dependence and mutuality mean in the context of capitalism which is really focused on issues of individual competence\". Even New Labour, which he broadly supports, \"fosters this impossible image of a kind of New Labour superman\". In middle age, Sennett says he has returned to his political roots. \"I started out in the 60s when it was pretty fevered on the left. And then I moved right in reaction to all the bullshit of the counter- culture. I got fed up with that anti intellectualism, the rejection of serious ideas, of serious art and the measurement of reality by psychological categories of the moment, an emphasis on immediate gratification.\" The Fall Of Public Man was anti-psychological, an anti-touchy-feely book and in American terms, that was anti-radical. But the error he made, he says, was to draw political consequences from his rejection of the counter-culture... a trajectory that has finally brought him back to the left. \"This genetic socialism reasserted itself and I've returned to overtly writing about socialism. In America, I voted Green at the last election for the simple reason that it has become a party with a single overarching ideal - electoral reform, which means ending the private funding of politics in the US. \"Even when I had this period of disillusion with the cultural left, I still voted Socialist Worker. I voted for the party not in one of its Trotskyist phases, which I hated, but in one of its Green, multicultural, pluralist phases, which I like.\" He talks about meeting President Clinton, who said to him\"It's always good to meet an intelligent Democrat.\" \"When I told him I voted Socialist Worker the famous Clinton smile froze.\" Sennett lives most of the year in London, returning to the States for three months. Sassen similarly divides her time between the two countries. Although Sennett describes London as \"our emotional base\" he appears genuinely outraged at \"the degree of bureaucratic micro-management in [British] academia. My colleagues, particularly the younger ones, are very depressed by it. Academics are constantly filling out forms, their emails can be looked at by the government. In America, there is far more appreciation of academics than in official Britain. Here there is an institutionalised contempt which makes it hard to do good work.\" At the same time he describes his students here, \"as the best I've ever had\". Sennett claims he has written enough. He would like to end his days as he began them, as a professional performer or possibly running a music festival, maybe somewhere like the Wigmore Hall in London. When he has finished the current book on socialism, \"I have probably only one book left in me. I would like to do something on the sociology of performing.\" Music remains his great love and he has returned to playing the cello after several operations on his hand. \"The ability to play again is one of the greatest gifts middle age has brought me.\" He plays in a small chamber group, with, among others, the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, on clarinet. But the popular reception for a work like The Corrosion Of Character suggests there is a hunger out there for the informed, exploratory, and in some ways gentle anti-capitalism that Sennett represents. With his grasp of history, his sympathy for the radical cause, his understanding of city life and his own professional success, he is one of the few writers who can puncture the pretensions and false hopes of the New Economy with some authority. He was also one of the first writers to predict, again with admirable restraint, the economic and political turbulence that may lie ahead. For, as the chilling last line of the Corrosion Of Character observes, a regime \"which provides human beings no deep reasons to care about one another cannot long preserve its legitimacy\".

In a long life, Seawell has played many parts: lawyer, Broadway producer, newspaper proprietor and presidential speechwriter. But it was as chairman of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts that he personally authorised the spending of $8m that turned Tantalus from a tantalising dream into a theatrical reality. Talking to him at London's Connaught Hotel, I was struck by Seawell's old-world courtesy and passionate liberalism; but there is something in his piercing gaze that persuades me he is a man who also likes to get his way. </p> <p>As an RSC governor, Seawell has known John Barton - and Peter Hall - for 40 years and was well aware of the prolonged gestation of Barton's Trojan epic. \"As soon as I read the manuscript,\" he says, \"I knew this was something I wanted to be involved in. When it started out there were six potential backers, but one by one they all fell out. Finally, there was only the Denver Center left so I had to gulp and say, 'OK, we'll do it.' The money actually comes from a foundation that was set up in 1981 when I sold the Denver Post to the Times-Mirror group. Backing Tantalus was entirely a personal decision, which my board happily went along with.\" </p> <p>A classic case of enlightened patronage. But given Tantalus's well-documented rehearsal problems, did Seawell ever have doubts? \"Oh, many,\" he says. \"But I have only one regret, and that is the rift it has caused between John Barton and Peter Hall, which I hope can be patched up. John's complaint basically is that Peter has cut one of his plays and that he wasn't notified in advance of the textual changes. Peter's argument was that there was too much exposition and no proper ending. Having been a Broadway producer, I can sympathise with both sides. I think what John wants is for Peter to say, 'I went too far and I'm sorry.' But I doubt that Peter will say that and I'm not even sure he feels it.\" </p> <p>Whatever Tantalus's internal tensions, Seawell was thrilled with the result, especially by the fact that at one of Denver's packed- out performances there were people from 14 countries. But while Tantalus may be the crowning example of Seawell's gift for backing the right horse - even a Trojan one - what is extraordinary is his lifelong ability to move between different worlds. For instance, how did he, as a New York lawyer, become adviser and producer to such showbiz icons as No\u00ebl Coward, Tallulah Bankhead and the celebrated acting duo Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne? </p> <p>\"They were all friends of my wife, Eugenia Rawls, who was an actress, and they all asked me to represent them. I was especially close to the Lunts, who often referred to me as the son they never had. Alfred used to write to me every day. But, after I'd moved to Denver to publish the Post, one of the partners in my New York office cleaned out all the files - something lawyers do every six years - and so all the letters were lost. That broke my heart.\" </p> <p>Slightly more surprising is Seawell's closeness to Tallulah. She had a famous gift for outrage that once led her to remark that she favoured the conventional position for love-making because the alternatives gave her either claustrophobia or lockjaw. \"Sex to Tallulah,\" Seawell suggests, \"was no more important than shaking hands. Once that was out of the way, she was the most caring and devoted person. She was also a remarkable, if undisciplined, actress: when she played Blanche in Streetcar, Tennessee Williams, who had written the part for her, went backstage, got down on his knees and said she was the greatest Blanche he ever expected to see.\" </p> <p>On another occasion, Williams also told her, given their shared appetites and religious upbringing: \"Tallulah, you and I are the only two constantly high High Episcopalians I know.\" But what Seawell prefers to remember is her active endorsement of civil liberties and universal justice. </p> <p>Seawell's own life has also been devoted to liberal causes. Everything from the National Endowment for the Arts to Family Health International. He was also a speechwriter for Roosevelt and Truman and was asked by Kennedy to start a performance series for his cabinet, which led to him bringing Barton's the Hollow Crown to the State Department. But did he get on equally well with Republican incumbents? </p> <p>\"Well, I worked in counter- intelligence with Eisenhower during the war, and as a general he was wonderful. But I remember Ike circulating a memorandum to his staff in which he said he'd been approached to run for president. He said, 'I want you to know that under no circumstances will I accept the nomination. No military man should because his training has been too narrow.' He certainly turned out to be a hands-off president: he played golf more than 600 times during his eight years but the economy was booming so it didn't matter too much. </p> <p>\"Nixon was altogether different. In fact, I made his enemies-list. I was chairman of the American National Theatre and Academy and we'd been commissioned to send plays abroad, one of which Nixon vetoed on political grounds. I wrote to him to protest. At the time I was also publishing the Denver Post and we didn't support Nixon. So when my name was submitted as a trustee for the Kennedy Center, he struck it out, wrote 'This man is against me' and inserted Trisha Nixon's name instead.\" </p> <p>Seawell's liberalism, however, is balanced by strong convictions. As publisher of the Denver Post he encouraged columns expressing every shade of political opinion. But, in a crucial presidential election, his editorial board came to him and said they'd voted 16 to nil for one particular candidate. \"I said to them, 'You're now outvoted one to 16.' The candidate they had chosen was Ronald Reagan, who was a personal friend of mine, but I didn't let that stand in my way.\" </p> <p>But Seawell's lasting memorial will be the Denver Center for Performing Arts. When he first proposed the idea of an arts centre back in the early 1970s, the local mayor told him that it was an impossible dream because fewer than 3,000 people in the metropolitan area had ever been to a live performance. </p> <p>Now the centre is a vast, booming complex that houses eight performance spaces, boasts its own resident theatre company and has sundry offshoots including a media studio and an acting academy. \"Last year,\" says Seawell, \"a million and a half people in Denver came to see theatre alone, and that's not including ballet, symphony and opera. For a city of under two million that's not bad.\" </p> <p>Seawell embodies a kind of plutocratic liberalism that is peculiarly American: one based on private wealth and public service, and the notion that it's everyone's duty to leave the world a little better than they found it. I suspect there is a good deal of toughness under the silvery charm and that, having encouraged plurality of opinon, he enjoys having the final say. But as he takes his seat in Salford tonight, he can congratulate himself on the fact that, but for his swiftly unilateral action, Tantalus would have remained nothing more than a deskbound Attic dream. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Lowry, Salford (0161-876 2000), tonight then touring.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Flowers for their Size </strong></p> <p>\"I love flowers,\" says a friend, \"but I don't like plants.\" I can easily understand the distinction. Plants involve mess and responsibility and edaphic (\"of or pertaining to the soil\") requirements. They perhaps expect a commitment of us that we are not, at this stage in our lives, prepared to give. Flowers can seem to come out of nowhere. Bought, arranged, admired, chucked out - they are given no chance to reproach us. Arum lilies are like this: spotless, exotic, unreal. One can tell from his photographs that Robert Mapplethorpe loved flowers. One hardly expects him to have liked plants. </p> <p>Among the plants for people who don't really like plants is the recently popular category called \"architectural\"? What is an architectural plant? It is something big, and possibly expensive, and of a bold shape - above all something that promises to make an immediate and permanent impact on the space we are filling - but its resemblance to actual architecture may be minimal. A stand of bamboo does not remind me of any architecture I know, even though I have lived in countries where much of the architecture uses bamboo. And what building looks like a phormium? </p> <p>If I gaze up at a giant hogweed ( Heracleum mantegazzianum , a plant which we may not grow - an irresponsible plant), I may indeed be reminded of gothic fan vaulting. But a giant hogweed is not an architectural plant in the popular sense, because by the end of the year it is going to let us down: this beautiful structure will die back. I might add that if the giant hogweed looks architectural in its structure, then so do many umbellifers of different scale: cow-parsley, dill, and (a crop failure for us last year) Ammi majus , known in one of my books as false bishop's weed. (False bishops! When have you ever met a bishop who wasn't false?) </p> <p>Still, if we are to be thwarted in our ambitions to have the giant hogweed romping around the periphery, the angelicas are there as our reward, the grand old sentinels of vegetable gardens. I would choose (no 11) the oriental Angelica gigas , purple stemmed and purple flowered, although we have found it to be monocarpic (that is, it dies after flowering). </p> <p>In general, experimenting with various angelicas, we have found them easiest to keep going by shaking the seeds out of the ripe seedheads and allowing them to grow where they fall (they do not remain viable long). A plant, then, which may take a couple of years to reach full size. There follows one summer of glory, before it goes over.

      "bodyText": "Flowers for their Size \"I love flowers,\" says a friend, \"but I don't like plants.\" I can easily understand the distinction. Plants involve mess and responsibility and edaphic (\"of or pertaining to the soil\") requirements. They perhaps expect a commitment of us that we are not, at this stage in our lives, prepared to give. Flowers can seem to come out of nowhere. Bought, arranged, admired, chucked out - they are given no chance to reproach us. Arum lilies are like this: spotless, exotic, unreal. One can tell from his photographs that Robert Mapplethorpe loved flowers. One hardly expects him to have liked plants. Among the plants for people who don't really like plants is the recently popular category called \"architectural\"? What is an architectural plant? It is something big, and possibly expensive, and of a bold shape - above all something that promises to make an immediate and permanent impact on the space we are filling - but its resemblance to actual architecture may be minimal. A stand of bamboo does not remind me of any architecture I know, even though I have lived in countries where much of the architecture uses bamboo. And what building looks like a phormium? If I gaze up at a giant hogweed ( Heracleum mantegazzianum , a plant which we may not grow - an irresponsible plant), I may indeed be reminded of gothic fan vaulting. But a giant hogweed is not an architectural plant in the popular sense, because by the end of the year it is going to let us down: this beautiful structure will die back. I might add that if the giant hogweed looks architectural in its structure, then so do many umbellifers of different scale: cow-parsley, dill, and (a crop failure for us last year) Ammi majus , known in one of my books as false bishop's weed. (False bishops! When have you ever met a bishop who wasn't false?) Still, if we are to be thwarted in our ambitions to have the giant hogweed romping around the periphery, the angelicas are there as our reward, the grand old sentinels of vegetable gardens. I would choose (no 11) the oriental Angelica gigas , purple stemmed and purple flowered, although we have found it to be monocarpic (that is, it dies after flowering). In general, experimenting with various angelicas, we have found them easiest to keep going by shaking the seeds out of the ripe seedheads and allowing them to grow where they fall (they do not remain viable long). A plant, then, which may take a couple of years to reach full size. There follows one summer of glory, before it goes over. Such a habit cannot easily be accommodated in the kind of garden in which every scrap of space is supposed to be maximally active, year in, year out. All those umbels, all those umbellules.

      "body": "<p>Rotterdam film festival has always had a reputation for being leftfield, but this year it leapt straight into the realm of the conceptual. It didn\u2019t have an opening film - it had 18, screening simultaneously in all of the festival\u2019s various venues. The catch was that punters had no idea what they were going to get. So, on a strictly lucky-dip policy, you could have ended up with Memento, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or In the Mood For Love. Or, like your correspondent, you could have got the short straw - a downbeat German comedy about go-kart racing. Rotterdam\u2019s sprawling programme means that you can usually be sure of finding something to set your teeth on edge; this year it was Le Rat, a film touted as the French answer to Eraserhead, but in reality a morbid serial-killer fantasy.</p> <p>But you are equally sure to find a gem or two. One hot topic this year was the rediscovery of the small but fascinating back catalogue of the Swedish director Roy Andersson, whose apocalyptic Songs From the Second Floor - soon to be released in Britain - came 25 years after his last feature, the bizarre Giliap. And there was the Iranian film Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine, the toast of Tehran\u2019s festival last year. Its director, Bahman Farmanara, didn\u2019t make films for two decades because he was prevented from working by the Iranian authorities. He has now made a subtle, sometimes bitterly comic and angry fictionalised self-portrait. He himself plays an elderly film-maker pondering on mortality, loss and the peculiar inner death that faces an artist who is not allowed to work.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, Rotterdam is also good on seedy cult thrills. This year\u2019s undisputed hot ticket was Battle Royale, the new feature by veteran yakuza-thriller specialist Kinji Fukasaku, who had a retrospective here in the last festival. Currently doing massive box office in Japan, Battle Royale is about a game in which the country\u2019s worst-behaved class of high-school kids are sent to an isolated island, given weapons and ordered to kill each other until only one is left standing. All this under the watchful eye of their teacher, played by Takeshi Kitano. It\u2019s hard to tell whether Battle Royale really is the youth-hating authoritarian fantasy that it seems, or whether there\u2019s any more subversive intent. I suspect not, and that it\u2019s just the gloating, mean-spirited shoot-up game that it seems. But it feels like the sort of cheap and cheerfully vicious exploiter that used to come out of the Roger Corman stable in the 1970s. Thoroughly tawdry, Battle Royale is impossible not to enjoy.

      "bodyText": "Rotterdam film festival has always had a reputation for being leftfield, but this year it leapt straight into the realm of the conceptual. It didn\u2019t have an opening film - it had 18, screening simultaneously in all of the festival\u2019s various venues. The catch was that punters had no idea what they were going to get. So, on a strictly lucky-dip policy, you could have ended up with Memento, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or In the Mood For Love. Or, like your correspondent, you could have got the short straw - a downbeat German comedy about go-kart racing. Rotterdam\u2019s sprawling programme means that you can usually be sure of finding something to set your teeth on edge; this year it was Le Rat, a film touted as the French answer to Eraserhead, but in reality a morbid serial-killer fantasy. But you are equally sure to find a gem or two. One hot topic this year was the rediscovery of the small but fascinating back catalogue of the Swedish director Roy Andersson, whose apocalyptic Songs From the Second Floor - soon to be released in Britain - came 25 years after his last feature, the bizarre Giliap. And there was the Iranian film Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine, the toast of Tehran\u2019s festival last year. Its director, Bahman Farmanara, didn\u2019t make films for two decades because he was prevented from working by the Iranian authorities. He has now made a subtle, sometimes bitterly comic and angry fictionalised self-portrait. He himself plays an elderly film-maker pondering on mortality, loss and the peculiar inner death that faces an artist who is not allowed to work. At the other end of the spectrum, Rotterdam is also good on seedy cult thrills. This year\u2019s undisputed hot ticket was Battle Royale, the new feature by veteran yakuza-thriller specialist Kinji Fukasaku, who had a retrospective here in the last festival. Currently doing massive box office in Japan, Battle Royale is about a game in which the country\u2019s worst-behaved class of high-school kids are sent to an isolated island, given weapons and ordered to kill each other until only one is left standing. All this under the watchful eye of their teacher, played by Takeshi Kitano. It\u2019s hard to tell whether Battle Royale really is the youth-hating authoritarian fantasy that it seems, or whether there\u2019s any more subversive intent. I suspect not, and that it\u2019s just the gloating, mean-spirited shoot-up game that it seems. But it feels like the sort of cheap and cheerfully vicious exploiter that used to come out of the Roger Corman stable in the 1970s. Thoroughly tawdry, Battle Royale is impossible not to enjoy. And the Hollywood remake would be even better - perhaps directed by Paul Verhoeven, with Britney and Eminem getting to shoot it out at last? No less grisly was the latest from the Czech maestro Jan \u0160vankmajer. He unveiled not only his new feature Otesanek, but an exhibition of paintings, sculptures and other work by him and his wife and collaborator Eva \u0160vankmajerova.

      "body": "<p>In 1967, when the American director Joseph Strick was filming Ulysses in Dublin, a notice appeared in a reputable bookshop: \"There are over 8,000 books banned in Ireland. If by chance we have one on display, please inform us and it will be destroyed .\" </p> <p>\"The funny thing,\" says Strick, now 77 and living in Paris, \"is that James Joyce's novel was not one of them. As it had never been published in Ireland, it had never been censored, and under-the-counter copies were available.\" But when Strick's film was submitted to the Irish film censor's office the following year, it was rejected outright. </p> <p>The script was lifted straight from the book, and its reception mirrored the response to Ulysses in 1922 when the Dublin press howled that it was \"written by a perverted lunatic who has made a speciality of the literature of the latrine\". In 1968, a civil servant considering Ulysses on behalf of the then prime minister Jack Lynch reported that if the film was cleared for showing to \"any class\" of Irish audience, it would bring \"discredit\" on the government. </p> <p>The fortunes of Strick's film, which has now finally been passed for release in Ireland with a 15 certificate, are a measure of the enormous distance that Ireland has travelled in the last 30 years from what Brian Moore called \"a nation of masturbators under priestly instruction\". </p> <p>True to the book, the film records a series of episodes that take place in Dublin on June 16 1904. Much of the action is related through the consciousness of the three principal characters: Stephen Dedalus (Maurice Roeves), Leopold Bloom (Milo O'Shea) and Molly Bloom (Barbara Jefford). The script, like the text, switches between the spoken word and soliloquy. Strick says he always regarded Joyce as a great cinematic writer, and attributes much of the modern cinema to his inventions in Ulysses. Joyce had worked with the Russian cinematographer Sergei Eisenstein (maker of Ivan the Terrible) and founded the Volta cinema in Dublin. </p> <p>Despite the radical politics that swept the campuses of Europe and America in the 60s, Ireland remained immune to the ensuing social changes. Rosaleen Lenihan, who plays the dominatrix whore-mistress in the film's Circe episode, says she remembers the police forcing a small Dublin theatre to close after a contraceptive was dropped on stage during a performance of Tennessee Williams's The Rose Tattoo. </p> <p>Certainly Ireland, where women had even fewer rights than their European counterparts, was not judged to be ready for what Strick calls \"the pure magic: the mental pyrotechnics\" of Molly Bloom, languishing in bed and falling out of her nightdress. There is no surviving explanation of the film censor's decision, but the ban reflected the official reception it received in other countries. If it was rejected in Australia, and only shown to audiences segregated by sex in New Zealand, Ulysses was not going to be welcomed with open arms in a tiny theocratic backwater such as Ireland, where dancing was deemed to be the cause of bastards. </p> <p>If Dublin was not ready for Ulysses on film, neither was Cannes. Robert Favre Le Bret, the director of the 1967 film festival, obliterated 29 subtitles, proclaiming: \"There are certain things that can be read but not heard!\" Lady Dartmouth (later Raine Spencer, stepmother of Princess Diana), then a city councillor for London, stated -<sub> </sub>without having seen the film - that if someone did not protest, \"you'll have people making love in the streets\". </p> <p>The British Board of Film Censors demanded 29 cuts. Almost all were from Molly's monologue, which takes up a fifth of the film's running time. One can surmise what Lady Dartmouth's reaction would have been to Molly's musings amid the sex-stained sheets hours after cuckolding her husband: \"Never in all my life felt one so full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after what's the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us like a stallion driving it up into you...\" Strick's response was to insert in lieu of the removed sections 29 blank screens backed by a high-pitched shriek. The British censor relented. </p> <p>Sheamus Smith, the current censor in Dublin, says Strick's film is \"innocent stuff now\". He says the reason the ban has had to wait until now to be lifted is that \"nobody thought to bring it back before. I'm sure that if it had been resubmitted to me 14 years ago, when I first became censor, I would have made the same decision.\" </p> <p> Strick says he is \"over the moon\" that Ulysses has finally been passed, but is scathing of the censor's office: \"That is like saying that a prisoner could have been released from an unjust sentence if they'd only had the courtesy to ask to be let out of the hoosegow. They are craven. They pretend to be buffs when they're buffoons. They don't care about anything but the box office. They have combined to create a self-censoring industry.\" </p> <p>After the ban Strick made two appeals to the censor before giving up, then left Ireland for 25 years. In the meantime the film censor's office evolved from an institution that, in 1968 alone, banned over 100 films, to one that in the past 15 years has rejected only seven (including Natural Born Killers). The office owes its existence to 1923 legislation which judged films by \"subversive content\" and \"threat to public morality\". Now, however, it is principally a classification body. </p> <p>Strick finally returned to Ireland last year, to direct a bawdy comedy by Aristophanes in Cork, and says he found the country \"transformed\". He decided it was time to resubmit Ulysses. Women he had encountered in pre-Mary Robinson Ireland, he says, were \"fearful. When I returned I saw that they were barristers and doctors.\" While filming Ulysses, Strick had seen Dubliners \"foraging on corporation rubbish tips not yards from the beach. Nowadays unemployment is 4%!\" </p> <p>After 33 years Joyce's own nation will finally cease to be the only one in Europe where audiences are not allowed to see the sole film of Ulysses made in English. Many will be introduced to the work for the first time. Smith, passing the film uncut, told Strick: \"We owe you one.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Ulysses opens in Dublin next Friday. Tanya Sillem's TV report on Ulysses will be shown on Channel 4 News at 7pm next Thursday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Just when it seems that the solitary, snow-bound highway might really lead nowhere, the ghost town of Oktyabrskiy peers over the permafrost, its skyline a grim, gap-toothed leer. As we approach, a hammer-and-sickle-encrusted sign by the roadside announces what was once one of the busiest fishing ports in the Russian far east, a model soviet enterprise bustling with life. </p> <p>Stretching away behind, however, Oktyabrskiy's main Lenin Street now looks little more than a sliver of wasteland, lined on both sides by abandoned apartment blocks, their sunken windows staring blankly, their facades in the advanced stages of decay. Dilapidated wooden cottages, stripped to timber skeletons, clutter the moul dering side-streets. Everywhere, tatty scraps of open ground appear to have been seeded with trash and twisted metal. And all along the pier, the rotting shells of trawlers lie entombed in ice. </p> <p>Only occasionally do the last sad remnants of Oktyabrskiy's population stumble into this desolate scene, some of them sullen teenagers who pass without expression, but the majority hunched and elderly, the human detritus of an unprecedented decade of decline: \"It's difficult to believe this place was once crammed with people,\" says Lidia Ivanovna, the town's current governor, and our guide through the ruins. \"All we have left are the very young, the very old and the sick - the people who couldn't leave. We're trapped between the tundra on one side and the sea on the other. Oktyabrskiy has been condemned to a gradual death.\" </p> <p>Over the past 10 years, Russia has been haemorrhaging humanity at a rate unprecedented for a modern, industrialised nation, except during times of famine or war. At the fall of communism, the population stood at 148.3m, a number that has been steadily sinking by between 300,000 a year, in 1993, and almost 800,000 in 1999, the most dramatic 12-month slump to date, a net loss of 0.5 % of Russia's total inhabitants. In an atmosphere of deep pessimism about the country's future, the traditionally high birth rate has plummeted to 1.3 children per woman, the lowest in Russia's history. At the same time, the death rate has soared; average life expectancy for the Russian male is now just 59, some 10-15 years less than in any western country, while women can expect to live to 72, six to eight years less than their European sisters. In yet another symptom of the Russian demographic malaise, this male/female discrepancy is the largest in the world. </p> <p>Other indicators are equally alarming: infant mortality is on the rise, 15.8 per 1,000 births in 1999 as against 6.9 in the US that year; Russia has become one of the world's TB hot spots, and Aids is said to threaten an epidemic of sub-Saharan proportions; meanwhile, migration is depleting the human resources of the far-flung regions. As the scale of the situation was becoming clear in 1998 and '99, the Russian Duma included genocide among the charges in an impeachment drive against the then president Boris Yeltsin, regarded as the architect of the debilitating reforms widely seen as the catalyst for the population collapse. However, if the projections of Russia's state statistics department, GosKomStat, are correct, the mammoth scale of the demographic catastrophe has yet to unfold. By the year 2016, they predict that Russia will lose another 8-10m, making the total loss for the post-soviet period more than the combined victims of Stalin's purges. </p> <p>Even in relatively thriving Moscow, which serves as a magnet for impoverished migrants from all over the former Soviet Union, there is still foreboding evidence of demographic subsidence: a precipitous 27% drop in the numbers of pre- and primary school infants has forced the closure of scores of the city's kindergartens and junior classes. Just a few hundred kilometres south of the capital, there are already dwindling villages, each one home to a meagre handful of pensioners. </p> <p>However, it is at the exposed and vulnerable extremities of the vast Russian territories that the atrophy of the population has been most acute. Perhaps the most startling example is Chukotka, a massive chunk of the far east three times the size of Britain, where the population has withered by a staggering 60%, from 180,000 in 1990 to just 65,000 today, a figure that is expected to slump to just 20,000 within the next five years, making the region's infrastructure unsustainable. Others include the Taimyr region in the far north, which enjoys 10 months of arctic winter and two of \"polar night\", which has bled more than 20% of its inhabitants and may now be in considerable danger of being evacuated by central government, and Kamchatka, an isolated peninsula, and the region where Oktyabrskiy is located. </p> <p>The final approach into Kamchatka after a nine-hour Aeroflot flight affords a view that might pass for an aerial vision of the edge of the earth. Its capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, is surrounded by a crescent of gently smouldering volcanoes, just a few of the 800 scattered throughout the peninsula, including Asia's largest and most lethal, the Klyuchevskaya Sopka. The ground beneath hides a mesh of grinding fault lines; we had barely stepped from the plane when an earthquake struck, jolting the ground for a few unnerving seconds. </p> <p>Since the fall of communism, almost a quarter of the overall population has seeped away. Unemployment in the grubby, low-lying capital is running at about 30%; 40% of its people live below Russia's already low poverty line, healthcare is nonexistent and fuel shortages have meant that until recently, heating and electricity were routinely shut down for as much as 17 hours a day. </p> <p>However, as we venture outside Petropavlovsk in the company of a Red Cross contingent, the situation worsens exponentially. Mountain-locked microclimates send the temperatures crashing to -30F. For hours, we encounter no other vehicles, just the occasional group of fishermen trudging through the snow. And then, at the end of one of the world's bleakest stretches of roadway, a desolate strip of asphalt separating the heaving lead-coloured waters of the Okhotsk Sea on one side and a huge frozen lake on the other, we finally encounter Oktyabrskiy. </p> <p>Perhaps fittingly, governor Lidia Ivanovna begins not with the physical wreckage of the town, but with a virtual tour of how it once was: \"Right here there used to be two rows of houses.\" She gestures towards sawn-off foundations in a completely deserted district known as Basa II. \"That was once a small port, where supplies were delivered before the road was built...\" </p> <p>The decay began, she explains, in the early 90s, with the liquidation of the fish-processing plant and cannery; in the new, market-driven environment, harsher even than the merciless natural climate the town had survived for decades, no one could justify the ballooning costs of transporting canned fish across the vastness of Russia. Since then almost 60% of the population of 4,500 has evaporated, and the spirit of the town with them. A heavy-set woman in her 50s who brooks little sentimentality, Lidia Ivanovna finds herself continually fighting back tears: \"People once lived well in Oktyabrskiy,\" she says. \"People once lived very well...\" </p> <p>By anyone's estimation, however, many of the remaining inhabitants of Oktyabrskiy now endure an almost bestial existence. One filthy apartment we visited, home of an alcoholic and his retarded son, was the most sordid imaginable, strewn with vodka bottles, stinking mattresses and the guts of ancient televisions. Across the stairwell, we find a woman of Koryak origin in a dark and sooty living room with her two youngest children, a mischievous boy and pretty moon-faced girl called Veronika, both suffering from tuberculosis. Ironically, because of spells in the TB hospital in Petropavlovsk receiving proper nutrition, they look infinitely healthier than the three emaciated older boys. </p> <p>Most of these pitiable human beings pray for escape - in any form - from their grimy purgatory. In the first block we visit, pen sioner Maria Riabchenko shows us round her two almost entirely bare, unheated rooms. Aged 72 and virtually blind, she has carefully stacked all of her possessions in one corner, in preparation for a journey she was almost certainly never going to make: \"I want to get out of this prison,\" she hisses. \"Many people have already fled but the rest of us would also get out if we could. I have everything packed. I'd have left long ago, except that I don't have any money.\" With tears streaming, she adds, bitterly: \"But I can wait. I'm very patient...\" In the next stairwell, we call on Valintin Igulayev, an amiable old man who arrived in Oktyabrskiy in the 50s, brimming with idealism: \"A friend of mine said one day: 'Let's go to Kamchatka' and I immediately answered, 'Why not?'. I was up for some romance and adventure.\" His elderly wife, Lilia, has just been diagnosed with cancer of the colon; but with their combined pensions totalling about $70 (\u00a345) a month, she has no hope of getting adequate treatment. Physically shaking and with tears welling up in her eyes, she explains that her only option is to sit at home and wait for the tumour to consume her: \"The doctor says that I must pay 15,000 roubles for the treatment, but I don't even have 40 roubles for fish in the market...\" </p> <p>Oktyabrskiy's clean but impossibly spartan hospital, which is forced to rely on the Red Cross for basic commodities such as soap and washing powder, has almost given up trying to help the seriously ill. Instead, certain wards serve as a rest home for the most chronically destitute. </p> <p>In one upstairs room, Alexei, who has lost all coordination because of the devastation wrought by alcohol on his nervous system and looks 25 years older than his actual age of 48, shares a room with Vladimir, whose binge drinking caused a cerebral haemorrhage that deprived him of the use of one arm and his legs. \"We don't hope to cure them,\" Oktyabrskiy's head doctor, Nikolai Kuznetsov, tells me, \"but if we let them out now, they wouldn't survive long. The only option is to look after them here until we find a place for them in the old people's home in Petropavovsk or until they die...\" </p> <p>Our final stop is Oktyabrskiy's modest, two-storey school, which has seen numbers fall from 680 students 10 years ago to 240 today. This will sink further as every one of the children intends to flee the ailing town immediately on graduation: \"Oktyabrskiy is just a long street with the sea on both sides of it,\" says Oksana, a forthright 16-year-old who intends to move to Petropavlovsk, \"It's boring here. There are no sports facilities or anything. I want to study psychology and there are no higher education facilities. And I won't come back - there is no work and nothing to do.\" Another 16-year-old, Spartak, hopes to move either to England or Greece: \"Of course I'll miss Oktyabrskiy. It's my home,\" he says. \"But I have to survive and, for that reason, I have to move. I know that without us, Oktyabrskiy will die, but what can I do? Not a single one of my friends wants to stay...\" </p> <p>\"Russia has been shunted back a century,\" says Sergei Kaleshnikov of the statistics committee, GosKomStat. \"A contemporary man who is 50 can, according to statistics, live for another four to 10 years It's almost the same as it was 100 years ago.\" As is obvious from the situation in Oktyabrskiy, the primary causes of the demographic catastrophe are brutally simple: poverty, bad diet, poor living conditions and, in more industrialised parts of Russia, a polluted environment. </p> <p>This has been fatally compounded by an almost total implosion of the healthcare system, even in the more populous cities. The TB hospital in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy relies entirely on a 50-year-old fleurography machine, a hulking piece of apparatus that produces tiny imprints of lungs the size of postage stamps. In St Petersburg and Moscow, very few hospitals have the resources to perform what have become routine operations in the west such as heart bypasses; the leading TB hospital in St Petersburg can only afford to spend about 55p per day on its patients, much less than is required to cure many of them. Contemporary Russia is also an ideal breeding ground for infectious diseases such as TB which, incubated in the labyrinthine prison system, are now raging through the population. </p> <p>\"We are now on the verge of an epidemic,\" says Tatyana Suprun, one of St Petersburg's leading TB doctors. \"It's a consequence of the way we live now in Russia, often three generations in a tiny flat. If one person gets sick, everyone does.\" Aids too is rumbling beneath the surface, due to a potent combination of rising intravenous drug use, the post-soviet sexual revolution and an almost total lack of safe-sex education. </p> <p>However, the Russian populace is not only being corroded by disease, but also by its own self-destructive social reflexes. Alcohol consumption in Russia is the highest in the world, and deaths from alcohol poisoning far outstrips those in any other country: about 50,000 cases in 1999 as opposed to just 350 in the US, mostly as a result of a national predilection for binge drinking and the nature of the alcohol itself: \"Since about 1990 there has been no control of alcohol production,\" says Viktor Petrovich, head of Petropavlosk's addiction clinic. \"This has led to the availability of very low-grade spirits. People also started to brew their own, low-quality home brews that led to a lot of poisoning. In some cases, people even drank technical spirits.\" </p> <p>Finally, there is the issue of violent death: the Russian murder rate per capita, which has doubled since 1990, is the highest in the world, three times more than the US and four times more than France. And in the atmosphere of social gloom, suicides are also rising, up by a third from their 1990 levels. </p> <p>Russia and its long-suffering people have, throughout most of the country's demographic history, had a complicated, almost intimate relationship with the mechanics of death. As Catherine Merridale reported in her recent book on the death culture of Russia, Night of Stone (Granta \u00a325), crude death rates in Russia in the 1870s were far higher than for any European country: 38 deaths per 1,000 members of the population per year, compared to the corresponding rate in France and England of just over 22 per 1,000. </p> <p>If the situation continues to deteriorate today, Russia's accelerating population decline could become the most important challenge to the country's already unstable economic and political status in the world: \"If this trend does not change in 15 to 20 years,\" claims Valentin Pokrovsky, of the Russian Academy of Medical Science, \"for each working person, there will be one or two people who cannot work. It will be very difficult for the country.\" However, despite an insulating fatalism nurtured by Russians over centuries, the ultimate toll is a very human and individual one. </p> <p>The cemetery in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy is probably one of the most beautiful spots in the city, a sweeping, steep, snow-covered hill framed by the icy peaks of volcanoes. On one of the most picturesque slopes, a small army of youthful gravediggers is opening the frozen earth with picks, working simultaneously on three or four graves at once. All around, small picnic tables are piled with food, sustenance for the dead on their journey, while ravens, believed by Russians to be celestial pallbearers, circle hungrily overhead. One funeral (pictured above) is already in progress, the deceased an unemployed man of 44 who died suddenly from a heart attack, leaving behind a wife and young daughter. \"It was totally unexpected,\" said his brother, \"He was so young, still relatively healthy. Life killed him.\" </p> <p>As soon as it ends, another gets underway, this time of a 21-year-old man who had been kicked to death by a group of soldiers: \"He was just coming home and they beat him up. Five or six of them just set upon him,\" says his father. \"They beat him up and took his clothes. He was just left there lying naked in the snow; people just walked around him, nobody helped him. They only found him in the morning lying there dead - he didn't have a chance because of the cold.\" </p> <p>Once the body has been laid in the ground, the entire mountainside, as bleak and depleted a stretch of wilderness as any we have encountered during our journey to Kamchatka's depopulated margins, seems to fill up with the keening of his mother as she is led away.</p>",

Life killed him.\" As soon as it ends, another gets underway, this time of a 21-year-old man who had been kicked to death by a group of soldiers: \"He was just coming home and they beat him up. Five or six of them just set upon him,\" says his father. \"They beat him up and took his clothes. He was just left there lying naked in the snow; people just walked around him, nobody helped him. They only found him in the morning lying there dead - he didn't have a chance because of the cold.\" Once the body has been laid in the ground, the entire mountainside, as bleak and depleted a stretch of wilderness as any we have encountered during our journey to Kamchatka's depopulated margins, seems to fill up with the keening of his mother as she is led away.",

Supremely confident, he decides he can afford to take a nap by the roadside and allows the tortoise to catch up a bit. The plodding tortoise duly overtakes the sleeping hare and wins the race. The moral of the tale: slow and steady does it. Isa investors, considering where to place their equity allowance, can draw a few lessons from that tale. For when it comes to investment, slow and steady can often be a much better bet than the flashy performer which promises much then fizzles out. Just like the health warnings on packets of cigarettes, the messages that \"equity investment should be considered as long term\" are ignored by investors at their peril, yet, large numbers seem to find the latest bandwagon almost impossible to resist.

It is significant perhaps, that while at any one time it may be the sexy funds that head the one-year performance tables, over longer terms it is quite often the less flamboyant funds (the steady tortoises of the fund world) that produce the goods. Statistics from the performance analyst S&amp;P Micropal show that seven of the top 10 funds over the past 20 years come from the staid UK income and growth sectors. For investors unsure about where to put their Isa money this year, we asked independent financial advisers to nominate funds suitable for a hare (a higher risk bet) and one for a tortoise (a good steady fund for, say, a 10-year period). Mark Robinson of Berry Asset Management reckons that, given the fall, technology is a much better buy this year than last. For the hares, he goes for Henderson Global Technology.

      "body": "<p>January is often a month of clear-outs and two of the main London auction houses, Phillips and Christie's, have just held sales of the contents of country houses. These sales are not held as frequently as they once were, but are always extremely popular and well attended when they do occur. They are the antiques and collectibles trades version of finding buried treasure.</p> <p>Really valuable pieces have been locked away for ages, and because they have not chopped and changed hands are often in very good condition. These auctions contain not just rare and beautiful pieces but also bizarre oddities reflecting the diverse interests of different generations of families rich enough to buy fine things.</p> <p>Part one of the Phillips sale of the contents of Elm Hill a country house in Worcestershire, held at Knowle in the Midlands on January 10, al most doubled expectations to realise nearly \u00a3467,000.</p> <p>Elm Hill was the home of the Gibbons family, archetypal Victoria industrialists whose wealth came from banking and mining. The contents on offer ranged from toys and nursery items to expensive paintings. One highlight was The Shell, a family portrait by Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1849) and commissioned by John Gibbons who was a noted collector. The painting made \u00a331,050, against an estimate of \u00a37,000 to \u00a310,000.</p> <p>The Christie's, South Kensington, sale on January 24 comprised collections from three country houses in Buckinghamshire, Scotland and the Cotswolds and covered Georgian and Regency furniture, pictures, silver, ceramics and works of arts, as well as collectibles liking sewing boxes and Tunbridgeware pieces with estimates ranging from \u00a3200 to \u00a315,000.</p> <p>The first collection consisted of mainly fine Georgian and Regency furniture, removed from Cairness House in the north-east of Scotland. Built in 1791 by the noted Scottish architect James Playfair, the house was said to be one of the finest examples of neo classical architecture in Scotland. Until ill health forced a return south, Phillip Miller, an architect and design historian, together with wife Pat, a decorator specialising in period house design, spent six years restoring the house to its former glory.</p> <p>Highlights of the sale included a three pillar mahogany dining table estimated at \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000, and a William IV drum top library table which fetched \u00a317,625. At the lower end a collection of four various Tunbridgeware souvenir boxes sold in line with the estimate of \u00a3700 to \u00a31,100 and a late George III specimen wood and parquetry inlaid sewing box sold for \u00a3450, against an estimate of \u00a3300 to \u00a3500.</p> <p>The second was called Property From the Collection of Mr and Mrs Geoffrey Gomme, built up during the 1960s and 1970s and sourced almost entirely from auctions at the time. There was again an array of regency furniture including a pair of gilt wood eagle console tables carved with plumage estimated at \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000.</p> <p>The third sale - The Property of a Clergyman - consisted of the contents of a house in Gloucestershire. This also included some Regency furniture and a number of curiosities. There was a George III mahogany chamber barrel organ by Longman and Broderip, one of the best-known 18th century London barrel organ builders known today as Chappells, the piano manufacturers. It was thought this piece would make \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000.

      "bodyText": "January is often a month of clear-outs and two of the main London auction houses, Phillips and Christie's, have just held sales of the contents of country houses. These sales are not held as frequently as they once were, but are always extremely popular and well attended when they do occur. They are the antiques and collectibles trades version of finding buried treasure. Really valuable pieces have been locked away for ages, and because they have not chopped and changed hands are often in very good condition. These auctions contain not just rare and beautiful pieces but also bizarre oddities reflecting the diverse interests of different generations of families rich enough to buy fine things. Part one of the Phillips sale of the contents of Elm Hill a country house in Worcestershire, held at Knowle in the Midlands on January 10, al most doubled expectations to realise nearly \u00a3467,000. Elm Hill was the home of the Gibbons family, archetypal Victoria industrialists whose wealth came from banking and mining. The contents on offer ranged from toys and nursery items to expensive paintings. One highlight was The Shell, a family portrait by Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1849) and commissioned by John Gibbons who was a noted collector. The painting made \u00a331,050, against an estimate of \u00a37,000 to \u00a310,000. The Christie's, South Kensington, sale on January 24 comprised collections from three country houses in Buckinghamshire, Scotland and the Cotswolds and covered Georgian and Regency furniture, pictures, silver, ceramics and works of arts, as well as collectibles liking sewing boxes and Tunbridgeware pieces with estimates ranging from \u00a3200 to \u00a315,000. The first collection consisted of mainly fine Georgian and Regency furniture, removed from Cairness House in the north-east of Scotland. Built in 1791 by the noted Scottish architect James Playfair, the house was said to be one of the finest examples of neo classical architecture in Scotland. Until ill health forced a return south, Phillip Miller, an architect and design historian, together with wife Pat, a decorator specialising in period house design, spent six years restoring the house to its former glory. Highlights of the sale included a three pillar mahogany dining table estimated at \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000, and a William IV drum top library table which fetched \u00a317,625. At the lower end a collection of four various Tunbridgeware souvenir boxes sold in line with the estimate of \u00a3700 to \u00a31,100 and a late George III specimen wood and parquetry inlaid sewing box sold for \u00a3450, against an estimate of \u00a3300 to \u00a3500. The second was called Property From the Collection of Mr and Mrs Geoffrey Gomme, built up during the 1960s and 1970s and sourced almost entirely from auctions at the time. There was again an array of regency furniture including a pair of gilt wood eagle console tables carved with plumage estimated at \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000. The third sale - The Property of a Clergyman - consisted of the contents of a house in Gloucestershire. This also included some Regency furniture and a number of curiosities. There was a George III mahogany chamber barrel organ by Longman and Broderip, one of the best-known 18th century London barrel organ builders known today as Chappells, the piano manufacturers. It was thought this piece would make \u00a33,000 to \u00a35,000. In the event it realised five times the estimate selling for \u00a327,025. This reflects the fact that the Georgian and Regency periods were the golden age of British furniture making; the time of Hepplewhite and Chippendale. The top 10 was dominated by furniture. Eight of the ten were Georgian pieces and mostly mahogany. By contrast the Edward Seaga painting did not sell at all. The William IV (just about Georgian) mahogany drum top library bookcase, estimated at \u00a35,000 to \u00a38,000, realised \u00a317,525. A George III mahogany tallboy chest, estimated at \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000, fetched \u00a316,450. Nicholas Orchard, a specialist at Christie's, says: \"It was the wood - the mahogany - which sold these pieces. It was so rich, so textured.

A BP spokesman said that the Kashagan consortium, set up in 1997, was a large one with a number of members, including TotalFina, with stakes of more than 14%. \"We looked at the possibility of increasing our stake, to become a bigger player and to have more influence over the development, but were unable to do so,\" he said. He added that BP still had other interests in Kazakhstan, including a stake in the Tengiz oil field and in the CPC pipeline from Tengiz into Russia. The group recently sold its 7% stake in Lukoil, Russia's largest crude oil producer. It acquired the stake when it took over the US oil major, Atlantic Richfield. TotalFinaElf, which has a 14.3% stake in the Kashagan consortium, will become the largest shareholder when it completes the deal with BP, possibly this month. If the $400m figure - the price essentially of at least one billion barrels - is correct, it would value the Kashagan field at $4bn. Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev is determined to ensure that his country will become an oil superpower - even boasting that it will rival Saudi Arabia as the world's largest oil producer by 2015. Towns and villages on the Caspian Sea such as Atyrau have been touted as a future Aberdeen or Houston. Already \"American suburbs\" of large US-style executive homes and hotels have sprung up there. \u0095 US-owned utility TXU Europe said yesterday that it has sold its UK North Sea gas business, including assets and licences, to British company Consort Resources for $201m. Consort will also take over the operation of the Johnston gas field and an energy trading company linked to Consort will become the buyer under the life-of-field Johnston gas purchase agreement.

      "bodyText": "Most investors depend on others to manage their funds. Many wonder whether they could do better themselves. Pension schemes apart, portfolios are often erratic accumulations. Saving in unit trusts is the most popular and trouble-free method, though expensive. Next come investment trust shares with a quoted life of their own, or, increasingly, the Open Ended Investment Companies (Oeics) that hope to combine the best features of both. Yet direct investment was boosted by privatisations and once enthusiasm is aroused it may be the preferred course for the growing army of active retirees. Such basic goods as food and drink might be expected to provide sound investment prospects. In fact, returns have often been less than wholesome. The biggest and often best investment in the sector in recent years has been the Swiss giant Nestl\u00e9. For years Mars set the pace, but it remains in US family ownership.

There is now one childcare place for every 6.9 children under eight, down from one in nine three years ago, and a number of initiatives are now under way to expand and improve the provision of childcare to accommodate the needs of working parents.</p> <p>But there is still a long way to go before all parents will have the choice of quality, affordable and accessible childcare, which is what the campaigners want.</p> <p>To start with, British par ents' childcare bills have reached record heights, according to a survey from national childcare charity Daycare Trust to be published on Monday.</p> <p>A typical full-time nursery place for a two-year-old now costs more than \u00a3110 a week - more than \u00a35,700 a year and more than the average family with two children spends on housing or food.</p> <p>Regional variations (see table) mean that in some regions, notably London and the south-east, the cost of a typical nursery place rises to \u00a3135 a week, with some parents paying much more than this. And the typical cost of a childminder looking after a two-year-old full-time, which is often seen by parents as a more affordable and flexible option than using a nursery, is almost \u00a390 a week nationally, in other words, still more than \u00a34,500 a year.</p> <p>A serious gap in childcare provision is the continuing dearth of affordable places for children aged under three. According to Daycare Trust there are currently only 42,740 free or subsidised places for the 600,000 under-threes living in poverty.</p> <p>Also worrying is the fact that, while 124,000 families are getting help with childcare costs through the new Childcare Tax Credit (CTC) - three times the number getting help under the previous system - four out of five lone parents who could get help through the CTC for childcare costs are still not claiming it.</p> <p>\"Part of the reason for the lack of take-up is that parents are simply not aware of what they could be claiming, so there is a need to raise awareness and promote the availability of CTC,\" says Stephen Burke, director of Daycare Trust. CTC is available to parents on lower incomes (up to \u00a322,000 for one child and \u00a330,000 for two children) and contributes a maximum of \u00a370 for one child and \u00a3105 for two children per week towards childcare costs.</p> <p>But another major barrier is that parents are only eligible for CTC if they are using \"registered\" childcare, which includes childminders and nurseries registered and inspected by local authorities.

Three years on from the launch of the government's National Childcare Strategy, Britain's \"childcare gap\" is steadily closing. There is now one childcare place for every 6.9 children under eight, down from one in nine three years ago, and a number of initiatives are now under way to expand and improve the provision of childcare to accommodate the needs of working parents. But there is still a long way to go before all parents will have the choice of quality, affordable and accessible childcare, which is what the campaigners want. To start with, British par ents' childcare bills have reached record heights, according to a survey from national childcare charity Daycare Trust to be published on Monday. A typical full-time nursery place for a two-year-old now costs more than \u00a3110 a week - more than \u00a35,700 a year and more than the average family with two children spends on housing or food. Regional variations (see table) mean that in some regions, notably London and the south-east, the cost of a typical nursery place rises to \u00a3135 a week, with some parents paying much more than this. And the typical cost of a childminder looking after a two-year-old full-time, which is often seen by parents as a more affordable and flexible option than using a nursery, is almost \u00a390 a week nationally, in other words, still more than \u00a34,500 a year. A serious gap in childcare provision is the continuing dearth of affordable places for children aged under three. According to Daycare Trust there are currently only 42,740 free or subsidised places for the 600,000 under-threes living in poverty. Also worrying is the fact that, while 124,000 families are getting help with childcare costs through the new Childcare Tax Credit (CTC) - three times the number getting help under the previous system - four out of five lone parents who could get help through the CTC for childcare costs are still not claiming it. \"Part of the reason for the lack of take-up is that parents are simply not aware of what they could be claiming, so there is a need to raise awareness and promote the availability of CTC,\" says Stephen Burke, director of Daycare Trust.

But another major barrier is that parents are only eligible for CTC if they are using \"registered\" childcare, which includes childminders and nurseries registered and inspected by local authorities. The many parents who pay relatives to look after their children, unless the relative registers as a childminder, are ineligible for CTC. So too are parents who employ nannies to care for children in their own homes because, despite calls for a change in legislation, nannies remain unregistered at present. Average salaries for a daily nanny are now \u00a322,000 in central London, \u00a317,750 in Greater London and the home counties, \u00a315,000 in urban areas elsewhere in Britain and \u00a314,000 in rural areas, according to a recent survey in the magazine Nursery World. \"The ceilings in CTC also need to be reviewed,\" Mr Burke says. \"It is critical that parents on lower incomes can afford the cost of a typical nursery which clearly now exceeds the CTC ceiling. The geographical lottery in childcare prices means parents in London, and the south-east particularly, benefit least from CTC and the ceiling should be raised or removed completely.\" Other major gaps in existing childcare provision include the lack of formal childcare services for children with special needs, for black and minority ethnic children, for shiftwork ing parents who need childcare outside the pattern of the traditional nine-to-five working day, and for student parents, who often struggle to find affordable care at or near their college. Mr Burke says: \"We are seeing real change. The childcare revolution we are now witnessing can be compared to the 1880s, when schools became available to all. But we are only at the beginning. \"The childcare revolution is still invisible to most parents in the country. Every day parents call our helpline searching for financial help or simply saying no childcare is available where they live.\" So what is being done so far and what more could be done to further the provision of quality, affordable childcare for all? The government has now met its target of providing free nursery places, guaranteeing five two-and-a-half hour sessions per week for all four-year-olds and has recently pledged to extend this provision to all three-year-olds by September 2004. Announcing the provision of a further 80,000 free nursery places for three-year-olds this year, education secretary David Blunkett said that many of these places will be integrated with childcare so that children can be looked after on one site throughout the day, allowing parents the chance to return to work, education or training. Five \"wrap-around care\" pilot schemes to test the benefits of providing early education and childcare on one site will begin later this year and run until March 2003 in Cornwall, Ealing, Kirklees, Lancashire and York. Recognising that parents who live in the most deprived areas have particular problems finding affordable childcare, the government has committed \u00a3203m over the next three years to fund some 900 new Neighbourhood Nurseries, which will create a minimum of 45,000 childcare places in disadvantaged communities. Mr Blunkett confirmed last Friday that a further \u00a3155m from the New Opportunities Fund, a National Lottery distributor, will be used to provide capital support for the new nurseries and start-up funds for around 50,000 out of school childcare places in disadvantaged areas. Mr Blunkett said: \"By March 2004, the government's ambition is for every lone parent living in a disadvantaged area to have a childcare place when they enter work.\" Pioneers of the neighbourhood nursery approach include centres like the Robert Owen Early Years Centre in Greenwich, London, which combines childcare with a nursery school in all-year-round provision and provides a range of family support services. Behind these initiatives, aimed at developing different types of childcare to suit different needs, is the government's stated objective to offer parents diversity and choice in childcare. Finding out what parents and children really want and need from childcare was the primary aim of the independent Childcare Commission, a one-year-old body set up by Kids' Clubs Network at the beginning of 2000, which reported its findings and recommendations this week. The commission is now proposing building a fairly radical \"integrated childcare system\" on the foundations of the government's existing childcare initiatives, including a children's centre in every area, tax relief on childcare outlay and financial support for families in the first three years of a child's life. Daycare Trust runs a childcare helpline for parents on 020 7739 2866, open for calls Monday to Friday, 10am-5pm. Parents can also visit www.daycaretrust.org.uk for advice on paying for childcare. The government's ChildcareLink service, which parents can contact for details of facilities in their area, is on freephone 0800 096 0296 or online at www.childcarelink.gov.uk. Copies of the Childcare Commission's full report (price \u00a315) are available from Kids' Clubs Network. Email orders to publications.sales@kidsclubs.co.uk or fax to 020 7512 2010.

      "bodyText": "President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia tried to secure a political future for himself yesterday by appealing to the people while trying to ignore the parliamentary accusers who claim he is corrupt. One day after parliament decided to send Mr Wahid a formal warning, which could lead to his dismissal if MPs are dissatisfied with his response, the half-blind Muslim cleric insisted that he would not resign. \"I will not step down,\" he said during a meeting with worshippers at a Jakarta mosque. \"I will complete my presidential term.\" It ends in 2004. He was also bullish at a press conference at the presidential palace, saying MPs had acted improperly in censuring him based on their interpretation of events in two corruption scandals, rather than on the facts. \"There are people who talk about public lies and words which are not ethical, but they are still being used by those who consider themselves to be the people's representatives,\" he said. The presidential spokesman, Wimar Witolar, said that Mr Wahid would reply to parliament's memorandum of warning \"as soon as possible\" but would focus on responding \"to what's a very clear call for acceleration of reform, so he will accelerate action against corruption and violators of the law\". He was speaking in reference to the fact that among several thousand demonstrators on Jakarta's streets in the past two days, a number have been calling for an end to corruption, rather than an end to this presidency. But in a society where corruption is endemic and so many influential people want him out, it is unlikely Mr Wahid will be able to make much headway in the three months he has before parliament can issue its second and final warning. Mr Wahid would then have 30 days to appease parliament before it could initiate impeachment proceedings. Even if the president did prove successful in fighting corruption, it might not save him because a majority of legislators have decided they want him out.

On the face of it, a pardon for a man who boasted of committing 21 killings, one for each year of his nasty, brutish and short life, looks like a bit of a long shot in a nation that has just acquired a president who vigorously defends the death penalty. But, ever since William Bonney was gunned down by Sheriff Pat Garrett outside Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in July 1881, the legend of Billy the Kid has never stopped growing.

Mr Rios says the then governor of New Mexico, Lew Wallace, who was just finishing writing his novel Ben-Hur at the time, had led the Kid to expect he would get a pardon. Mr Rios made his move after being approached by constituents in Las Cruces claiming to be direct descendants of Billy the Kid. \"They just wanted to see if Billy could be pardoned, for the peace of mind of whoever is left whose family knew Billy,\" Mr Rios said this week. \"The passing of more than 100 years should have healed many of the wounds left in his wake.\" Unsurprisingly, Mr Rios's proposal has caused consternation among descendants of Sheriff Brady, who was shot 16 times in the back by Billy and his gang. \"Oh boy,\" said Bennett Brady, of Roswell. \"Whoever said something like that has got to be crazy.

      "body": "<p>When psychologist Jennie Cutler first sat down with John Duffy in November 1997 she thought it would be the start of possibly harrowing but essentially routine counselling.</p> <p>Instead Dr Cutler sat spellbound as in a series of highly charged sessions Duffy confessed to the brutal crimes he had always insisted he could not remember - then named his childhood friend, David Mulcahy, as his accomplice.</p> <p>These sessions led to one of Britain's biggest and most complex police investigations, culminating in Duffy facing his old friend across a courtroom to lay bare their horrific crimes.</p> <p>Dr Cutler, head of forensic psychology at Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire, saw Duffy when a prison officer suggested he needed individual counselling. He had nightmares, including one in which a girl ran along a canal towpath - the circumstances of one of the murders.</p> <p>In the first interview Duffy mentioned that the \"other kid's a friend\". Dr Cutler, who had little knowledge of Duffy, assumed he was talking about a partner who had stood trial. She asked him which prison his co-defendant was in, and was astonished when told he was still at large.</p> <p>As the interviews progressed, Duffy recalled his offences. The first attack he spoke about was when he and Mulcahy raped two au pairs on Hampstead Heath in north London. The memories, Dr Cutler said, flowed. Duffy clearly trusted her, and some believe he became infatuated with her. He finally admitted to 16 rapes and three murders, conceding there may have been others he had forgotten.</p> <p>His attitude to Mulcahy, which emerged during the interviews, is fascinating. Dr Cutler recorded in her notes: \"Has mixed feelings about David. It worries him he might still be offending, thinks he should pay for what he's done.\"</p> <p>But he also expressed concern over the welfare of Mulcahy's family, whom he had sworn to protect if Mulcahy had been caught instead of him.</p> <p>By the time Duffy's confession began, police had already turned their attention back to Mulcahy. They had long believed he was Duffy's partner, but in 1988 did not have enough evidence to prosecute.</p> <p>Operation Hart, the original inquiry that resulted in the conviction of Duffy, had been the largest since the Yorkshire Ripper investigation.</p> <p>Hart examined 68 offences in south-east England between 1982 and 1986 which detectives believed could be linked. Sometimes the offences were committed by two men, sometimes by one. Often they were near railway stations, leading to Duffy being called the Railway Rapist.</p> <p>As in the Ripper investigation, the sheer scale troubled the police. To their credit, they were prepared to innovate. The Hart inquiry was the first to call upon a psychologist, David Canter, then of Surrey University, to draw up a \"criminal profile\" of a suspect.</p> <p>But the detectives did not get close to Duffy and Mulcahy until the former came to their attention after an attack on his wife in July 1985. The police dug into Duffy's background and found that Mulcahy was his sole friend. Both were arrested but released pending inquiries.</p> <p>Within months they had murdered for the first time, perhaps because they now realised how vital it was not to leave witnesses, and were not rearrested until November 1986. Duffy was charged; but though Mulcahy was arrested three times, there was insufficient evidence to proceed against him.</p> <p>There were mistakes, possibly inevitable in an investigation of this size. After the pair had killed Alison Day, a woman recognised a photofit of Duffy and reported her suspicions three times; twice her message went unheeded, the third time it was lost.</p> <p>And while Duffy was on bail for the attack on his wife he was caught with a \"butterfly knife\". Though such a weapon had been used in some of the Hart attacks the link was not made. It is hardly surprising. At the start of the investigation officers had to document information manually and only towards the end had pilot computer systems. The foren sic scientists could not provide a breakthrough. DNA science, today a decisive tool, was then in its infancy. Police made do with trying to find links through blood grouping. In Duffy's case this was possible, as he had a rare blood type; in Mulcahy's it gave no conclusive help.</p> <p>Again, towards the end of Hart, some primitive DNA testing was done, but nor did this link Mulcahy with the crimes. In addition, seven victims failed to pick him out at identity parades.</p> <p>Mulcahy remained free. The police say there is no evidence that he went on to attack women alone after Duffy was jailed. But, disturbingly, they have said Mulcahy will be questioned about at least five other rapes. Professor Canter believes that Mulcahy's mindset makes it likely that he would have continued to offend after his friend's conviction.</p> <p>At least one woman, the Guardian has learned, who has come forward to allege she was a victim of Mulcahy alone, is considering bringing a complaint because she feels police did not do enough. She was attacked in 1983 when Duffy was free, but this shows that Mulcahy seems to have been prepared to operate alone. Duffy certainly carried out attacks by himself.</p> <p>One of the problems for the Hart team was their premise that Duffy had murdered alone. They knew that if they suggested that two men had been present at the killings, it would be much more difficult to convict the single man they had charged.</p> <p>At least they had some sort of result. Duffy was convicted of five rapes and two murders in 1988. He was acquitted of Anne Lock's murder on the judge's direction but now concedes he and Mulcahy did kill her.</p> <p>Then, between June 1996 and September 1998, there was a new series of sex attacks in Hampstead, near where Duffy used to live and Mulcahy was still based.</p> <p>Operation Loudwater was launched and found striking similarities with the Hart crimes. To see if the attacks were linked fresh DNA tests using improved techniques were carried out on evidence from the earlier inquiry, and compared with those of the Loudwater investigation. There was no link.</p> <p>But Mulcahy was also arrested in connection with Loudwater and a sample of his DNA taken. It ruled him out of the Loudwater series - but on a detective's hunch a \"speculative search\" of the DNA database was carried out and finally matched him with traces of semen found on the clothing of one of the Hart victims. At last, the evidence that had been missing in 1986 was there.</p> <p>By this time, the police discovered, Duffy was talking.</p> <p>In December 1998 Operation Marford, which ended with Mulcahy's conviction, was launched, the first \"cold case\" inquiry into serial murder undertaken in Britain.</p> <p>The team were determined not to let Mulcahy escape.

      "bodyText": "When psychologist Jennie Cutler first sat down with John Duffy in November 1997 she thought it would be the start of possibly harrowing but essentially routine counselling. Instead Dr Cutler sat spellbound as in a series of highly charged sessions Duffy confessed to the brutal crimes he had always insisted he could not remember - then named his childhood friend, David Mulcahy, as his accomplice. These sessions led to one of Britain's biggest and most complex police investigations, culminating in Duffy facing his old friend across a courtroom to lay bare their horrific crimes. Dr Cutler, head of forensic psychology at Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire, saw Duffy when a prison officer suggested he needed individual counselling. He had nightmares, including one in which a girl ran along a canal towpath - the circumstances of one of the murders. In the first interview Duffy mentioned that the \"other kid's a friend\". Dr Cutler, who had little knowledge of Duffy, assumed he was talking about a partner who had stood trial. She asked him which prison his co-defendant was in, and was astonished when told he was still at large. As the interviews progressed, Duffy recalled his offences. The first attack he spoke about was when he and Mulcahy raped two au pairs on Hampstead Heath in north London. The memories, Dr Cutler said, flowed. Duffy clearly trusted her, and some believe he became infatuated with her. He finally admitted to 16 rapes and three murders, conceding there may have been others he had forgotten. His attitude to Mulcahy, which emerged during the interviews, is fascinating. Dr Cutler recorded in her notes: \"Has mixed feelings about David. It worries him he might still be offending, thinks he should pay for what he's done.\" But he also expressed concern over the welfare of Mulcahy's family, whom he had sworn to protect if Mulcahy had been caught instead of him. By the time Duffy's confession began, police had already turned their attention back to Mulcahy. They had long believed he was Duffy's partner, but in 1988 did not have enough evidence to prosecute. Operation Hart, the original inquiry that resulted in the conviction of Duffy, had been the largest since the Yorkshire Ripper investigation. Hart examined 68 offences in south-east England between 1982 and 1986 which detectives believed could be linked. Sometimes the offences were committed by two men, sometimes by one. Often they were near railway stations, leading to Duffy being called the Railway Rapist. As in the Ripper investigation, the sheer scale troubled the police. To their credit, they were prepared to innovate. The Hart inquiry was the first to call upon a psychologist, David Canter, then of Surrey University, to draw up a \"criminal profile\" of a suspect. But the detectives did not get close to Duffy and Mulcahy until the former came to their attention after an attack on his wife in July 1985. The police dug into Duffy's background and found that Mulcahy was his sole friend. Both were arrested but released pending inquiries. Within months they had murdered for the first time, perhaps because they now realised how vital it was not to leave witnesses, and were not rearrested until November 1986. Duffy was charged; but though Mulcahy was arrested three times, there was insufficient evidence to proceed against him. There were mistakes, possibly inevitable in an investigation of this size. After the pair had killed Alison Day, a woman recognised a photofit of Duffy and reported her suspicions three times; twice her message went unheeded, the third time it was lost. And while Duffy was on bail for the attack on his wife he was caught with a \"butterfly knife\". Though such a weapon had been used in some of the Hart attacks the link was not made. It is hardly surprising. At the start of the investigation officers had to document information manually and only towards the end had pilot computer systems. The foren sic scientists could not provide a breakthrough. DNA science, today a decisive tool, was then in its infancy. Police made do with trying to find links through blood grouping. In Duffy's case this was possible, as he had a rare blood type; in Mulcahy's it gave no conclusive help. Again, towards the end of Hart, some primitive DNA testing was done, but nor did this link Mulcahy with the crimes. In addition, seven victims failed to pick him out at identity parades. Mulcahy remained free. The police say there is no evidence that he went on to attack women alone after Duffy was jailed. But, disturbingly, they have said Mulcahy will be questioned about at least five other rapes. Professor Canter believes that Mulcahy's mindset makes it likely that he would have continued to offend after his friend's conviction. At least one woman, the Guardian has learned, who has come forward to allege she was a victim of Mulcahy alone, is considering bringing a complaint because she feels police did not do enough. She was attacked in 1983 when Duffy was free, but this shows that Mulcahy seems to have been prepared to operate alone. Duffy certainly carried out attacks by himself. One of the problems for the Hart team was their premise that Duffy had murdered alone. They knew that if they suggested that two men had been present at the killings, it would be much more difficult to convict the single man they had charged. At least they had some sort of result. Duffy was convicted of five rapes and two murders in 1988. He was acquitted of Anne Lock's murder on the judge's direction but now concedes he and Mulcahy did kill her. Then, between June 1996 and September 1998, there was a new series of sex attacks in Hampstead, near where Duffy used to live and Mulcahy was still based. Operation Loudwater was launched and found striking similarities with the Hart crimes. To see if the attacks were linked fresh DNA tests using improved techniques were carried out on evidence from the earlier inquiry, and compared with those of the Loudwater investigation. There was no link. But Mulcahy was also arrested in connection with Loudwater and a sample of his DNA taken. It ruled him out of the Loudwater series - but on a detective's hunch a \"speculative search\" of the DNA database was carried out and finally matched him with traces of semen found on the clothing of one of the Hart victims. At last, the evidence that had been missing in 1986 was there. By this time, the police discovered, Duffy was talking. In December 1998 Operation Marford, which ended with Mulcahy's conviction, was launched, the first \"cold case\" inquiry into serial murder undertaken in Britain. The team were determined not to let Mulcahy escape. They debriefed Duffy, corroborating every piece of evidence possible. His evidence proved \"chillingly accurate\". But why did Duffy come clean? He claims it was to salve his conscience, saying: \"I feel a lot of guilt and want to make a clean slate of it and own up. I am also worried I had a co-defendant who is still at large.\" His avowals have to be treated with caution. Though Duffy has been told he will spend the rest of his life in prison, it is possible his confession may lead to his category A status eventually being reassessed. Whatever his motive, his decision allows police to draw a line under one of the most horrific series of offences in history.",

When they were 13, Mulcahy was caught torturing and killing a hedgehog in the playground as Duffy watched.</p> <p>Often they played truant together on nearby Hampstead Heath. They enjoyed creeping up on courting couples and leaping out to frighten them. After they left school they would prowl the heath.</p> <p>They also became fascinated with martial arts and both had a treasured collection of knives. Duffy, for one, studied Zen Budo, a form of martial arts with the motto \"Leave no witnesses\".</p> <p>A copy of the notorious manual The Anarchist's Cookbook, which instructs on how to kill with bare hands, was found in Duffy's home. There is no reason to believe Mulcahy did not also learn such skills.</p> <p>The pair left school in 1975 with no qualifications. Mulcahy did building work and helped out in his father's pubs while Duffy went on to work for British Rail. This gave him the intimate knowledge of the railway system which the pair were to use to find secluded places for their attacks.</p> <p>In 1976 they were convicted of assault after taking shots with an airgun at passersby from the balcony of a pub in west London. And then there were those first two botched attempts at rape.</p> <p>Their motive - according to Duffy - was to get back at the two intended victims. This supports the idea that their bond stemmed from their feelings of alienation.</p> <p><b> Marriage</b><br></p> <p>By their next attack both had married. Mulcahy met Sandra in 1976. They married in 1978 and went on to have five sons. Duffy married Margaret in 1980 but they could not have children because of his low sperm count, which put great pressure on the relationship.</p> <p>The first rape took place in October 1982. Margaret was away and they planned to abduct a woman and rape her in Duffy's flat. They pounced on a woman in nearby Kilburn High Road but decided against taking her back. Instead they raped her in a building site.</p> <p>Back at the flat, according to Duffy: \"We were both very excited and said we should do it again.\" They got away with it despite Margaret returning unexpectedly and believed they would never get caught because they were cleverer than the police.</p> <p>The pair began to plan the attacks in detail. They plotted where to take their victims, what they should call each other and arranged escape routes.</p> <p>Duffy explained: \"We normally travelled by car. We called it hunting. Part of it was looking for a victim, finding her and tracking her. David had a tape of Michael Jackson's Thriller. We used to put that on and sing along to it as part of the build-up.\"</p> <p>They armed themselves with knives and on at least one occasion a replica gun, and wore dark clothes and balaclavas or hooded tops.

He once forced a handkerchief down Margaret's throat. He claimed that problems with his marriage led to his offending: \"I think I just wanted to strike back at my wife by raping women.\"</p> <p>Mulcahy told a work colleague his wife was \"completely submissive\" but there is little evidence he treated her badly. Last night she continued to insist he was innocent.</p> <p>It is unusual, but not unique, for two men to rape together. The pattern of offending, however, beginning with childish high jinks before progressing to minor offences then on to serious crimes, is common.</p> <p>Forensic psychologist Dan Wilcox, who has a consultancy role with the West Midlands probation service, said it was likely the pair had started fantasising about rape as early as the age of 12.</p> <p>Mr Wilcox said each would have justified the other's actions in much the same way as sex offenders would do in paedophile rings. \"They change what normality is and justify each other's actions,\" he said.</p> <p><b> Excitement</b><br></p> <p>The excitement level grew. Duffy said: \"We used to compare the attacks. We would feed off each other's emotions.\" They also became proficient at hiding their tracks, trying to cover up evidence they might have left behind.</p> <p>Between October 1982 and March 1985, by which time they were working together at Westminster council, they raped or conspired to rape 12 times. The youngest of the victims was just 16.</p> <p>The attacks bound them ever closer. One victim said they were like \"two bodies with one brain, soulmates\".</p> <p>The pair's hunger for excitement led them to grow ever more violent until killing seemed a logical next step. Duffy said Mulcahy had liked the idea of \"playing God\" with their victims and considered himself an \"immortal warrior\".</p> <p>In December 1985 they killed for the first time. The victim, 19-year-old Alison Day, infuriated Mulcahy by trying to flee after she had been raped by the pair, who this time had not bothered to cover their faces. They strangled her with a strip of her clothing and dumped her body in a canal.</p> <p>The following April they ambushed Maartje Tamboezer as she rode her bicycle. Duffy raped her and Mulcahy put her belt around her neck and ordered Duffy to twist it. They murdered for the final time in May 1986, this time killing 29-year-old Anne Lock. Duffy raped her and then went and sat in the car. When Mulcahy returned he said she would not be identifying them.</p> <p>Now the police were closing in on Duffy. He raped once more - alone this time - in October 1986 at a time when he knew the police were watching him.</p> <p>The pair had vowed to protect each other if one got caught. For a decade Duffy kept his side of the bargain.</p>",

They carried tape to cover the victims' mouths and eyes and terrified them by threatening to slash them. But how could Mulcahy and Duffy leave their wives at night and do what they did? Psychologists agree that in almost all cases where sex offenders are married, their wives are victims of an abusive relationship. Duffy's definitely was. He once forced a handkerchief down Margaret's throat. He claimed that problems with his marriage led to his offending: \"I think I just wanted to strike back at my wife by raping women.\" Mulcahy told a work colleague his wife was \"completely submissive\" but there is little evidence he treated her badly. Last night she continued to insist he was innocent. It is unusual, but not unique, for two men to rape together. The pattern of offending, however, beginning with childish high jinks before progressing to minor offences then on to serious crimes, is common. Forensic psychologist Dan Wilcox, who has a consultancy role with the West Midlands probation service, said it was likely the pair had started fantasising about rape as early as the age of 12. Mr Wilcox said each would have justified the other's actions in much the same way as sex offenders would do in paedophile rings. \"They change what normality is and justify each other's actions,\" he said. Excitement The excitement level grew. Duffy said: \"We used to compare the attacks. We would feed off each other's emotions.\" They also became proficient at hiding their tracks, trying to cover up evidence they might have left behind. Between October 1982 and March 1985, by which time they were working together at Westminster council, they raped or conspired to rape 12 times. The youngest of the victims was just 16. The attacks bound them ever closer. One victim said they were like \"two bodies with one brain, soulmates\". The pair's hunger for excitement led them to grow ever more violent until killing seemed a logical next step. Duffy said Mulcahy had liked the idea of \"playing God\" with their victims and considered himself an \"immortal warrior\". In December 1985 they killed for the first time. The victim, 19-year-old Alison Day, infuriated Mulcahy by trying to flee after she had been raped by the pair, who this time had not bothered to cover their faces. They strangled her with a strip of her clothing and dumped her body in a canal. The following April they ambushed Maartje Tamboezer as she rode her bicycle. Duffy raped her and Mulcahy put her belt around her neck and ordered Duffy to twist it. They murdered for the final time in May 1986, this time killing 29-year-old Anne Lock. Duffy raped her and then went and sat in the car. When Mulcahy returned he said she would not be identifying them. Now the police were closing in on Duffy. He raped once more - alone this time - in October 1986 at a time when he knew the police were watching him. The pair had vowed to protect each other if one got caught. For a decade Duffy kept his side of the bargain.",

It all began in 1980 when India became worried about the build-up of Pakistan's defence forces with hi-tech equipment from the United States.

By the end of May the corporation had three Swiss bank accounts with the code names Mont Blanc, Tulip and Lotus.</p> <p>Swiss banking records show that Mont Blanc was opened at the request of Prakash P Hinduja, who lives in Switzerland. Prakash confirmed that \"we are the beneficial owner of MacIntire Corp (sic)\" and added that the account was to receive more than 11m Swedish kroners sent by AB Bofors.</p> <p>Two further accounts linked to the Hinduja family and the McIntyre Corporation were opened by May 30.</p> <p>Between May and December, \u00a321m in Swedish kroners flowed into the accounts.</p> <p>The Hindujas were not the only players on the scene. In the autumn of 1985 the British director of a shell company in Guildford, Surrey, A E Services, had been approached by an Italian businessman, Ottavio Quattrocchi, a family friend of Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi. In November, a contract was signed between the company and Bofors and an account was opened in Zurich, which in September 1986 received more than $7m from Bofors. This then migrated via Panama, Geneva, Guernsey and Austria to accounts controlled by Quattrocchi and his wife Maria.</p> <p>The first whiff of a scandal came within a year when Swedish public radio alleged that commissions had been paid on the deal and that the Hindujas were recipients. The brothers immediately issued a denial saying \"there is a clear-cut conspiracy to malign the name of the family.\" Rajiv Gandhi described the allegations as \"false, baseless and mischievious.\" Bofors insisted that no bribes or commissions had been made.</p> <p>Reluctantly, \"to set the controversy at rest\" as he put it, Gandhi asked Sweden to investigate and a report was drawn up by the national audit office but never published in full. An Indian joint parliamentary committee started investigations and senior Bofors executives gave evidence.</p> <p>According to the CBI, they lied. Yes, a consultancy agreement had been entered into with three companies for advice about banking and counter trade, but this had been cancelled in January 1986 before the Bofors deal was signed.</p> <p>The committee exonerated the government of wrongdoing and Rajiv was able to claim: \"To the best of my belief the Swedish audit report upholds the government of India position and does not contradict it.\"</p> <p>There the matter may have been fallen off the political radar screens were it not for some tenacious digging by the Madras-based Hindu newspaper. Over two years, the Hindu published Swiss banking documents and sensational parts of the audit report. The documents linked the Hindujas to the commissions but the brothers immediately claimed they were false and fabricated. \"Baseless and malicious lies,\" said Gopichand (GP) Hinduja, who with his brother Srichand (SP) had by then established the headquarters of their multimillion business empire in London.</p> <p>But the audit report was devastating. It had found \"entirely proven commission payments to companies/accounts in Switzerland in relation to the Bofors deal.\" It went on: \"[That] these payments unquestionably relate to this deal is based on the fact that this has been communicated in writing by A B Bofors to the Bank of Sweden.\"</p> <p>The details of the three Hinduja accounts identified by the Swedes and the money transferred coincided exactly with the Swiss documents that eventually would be released in Geneva 10 years later.</p> <p>The Hindu also published extracts from the personal diary of Martin Ardbo, the former president of Bofors, in which Rajiv Gandhi was personally implicated. The sleaze was too much for the Indian electorate and in the elections of 1989 Gandhi and the Congress party were decisively defeated.</p> <p>Faced with such prima facia evidence, the Indian central bureau of investigaton began to show its mettle. On February 7 1990, it requested banking documents from the Swiss authorities. Two weeks later both G P and SP Hinduja, then assiduously courting Tory politicians, made their first unsuccessful applications for British passports.</p> <p>For the next seven years vigorous attempts were made to block the Swiss legal process. In 1992 the Indian foreign minister was forced to resign after it was revealed that he had surreptitiously asked the Swiss to stop the inquiries.</p> <p>The first decision by the Swiss courts to release the documents in 1993 led to Quattrocchi fleeing to Malaysia where he was arrested last December and awaits an extradition hearing.</p> <p>In 1997 the first batch of documents were ceremoniously handed over to the Indians and at the end of 1999 the first CBI charge sheet named Rajiv Gandhi, Quattrocchi, the agent W N 'Win' Chadha, Martin Arbdo of Bofors and the former defence minister, S K Bhatnagar, as criminal conspirators.</p> <p>The Hindujas were left to fight on but their final appeal against disclosure was dismissed in August 1999. As a last shot they petitioned Ruth Metzler, the Swiss federal councillor, asking her to stop the process on the grounds that the legal assistance to India might \"injure the sovereignty, the public order or other essential interests of Switzerland'.\" The petition was dismissed two months later.</p> <p>By that time, both GP and SP had their British passports granted in November 1997 and March 1999.</p> <p>The second batch of Swiss papers duly arrived in India in December 1999 and last October the brothers were named on a supplementary charge sheet.</p> <p>There was speculation that the new British nationals might have to be extradited but last month they flew to Delhi for hours of questioning by the CBI.</p> <p>The police described their explanations as \"evasive\" and the court refused them permission to leave the country.</p> <p>The brothers have not yet been formally charged but a reader of the robust Indian press might think they had already been convicted. The suggestion is, if there was nothing to hide, why did successive Indian governments, Bofors and the brothers themselves go to such elaborate and expensive lengths to keep the L'affaire Bofors under wraps?</p>",

Prakash confirmed that \"we are the beneficial owner of MacIntire Corp (sic)\" and added that the account was to receive more than 11m Swedish kroners sent by AB Bofors. Two further accounts linked to the Hinduja family and the McIntyre Corporation were opened by May 30. Between May and December, \u00a321m in Swedish kroners flowed into the accounts. The Hindujas were not the only players on the scene. In the autumn of 1985 the British director of a shell company in Guildford, Surrey, A E Services, had been approached by an Italian businessman, Ottavio Quattrocchi, a family friend of Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi. In November, a contract was signed between the company and Bofors and an account was opened in Zurich, which in September 1986 received more than $7m from Bofors. This then migrated via Panama, Geneva, Guernsey and Austria to accounts controlled by Quattrocchi and his wife Maria. The first whiff of a scandal came within a year when Swedish public radio alleged that commissions had been paid on the deal and that the Hindujas were recipients. The brothers immediately issued a denial saying \"there is a clear-cut conspiracy to malign the name of the family.\" Rajiv Gandhi described the allegations as \"false, baseless and mischievious.\" Bofors insisted that no bribes or commissions had been made. Reluctantly, \"to set the controversy at rest\" as he put it, Gandhi asked Sweden to investigate and a report was drawn up by the national audit office but never published in full. An Indian joint parliamentary committee started investigations and senior Bofors executives gave evidence. According to the CBI, they lied. Yes, a consultancy agreement had been entered into with three companies for advice about banking and counter trade, but this had been cancelled in January 1986 before the Bofors deal was signed. The committee exonerated the government of wrongdoing and Rajiv was able to claim: \"To the best of my belief the Swedish audit report upholds the government of India position and does not contradict it.\" There the matter may have been fallen off the political radar screens were it not for some tenacious digging by the Madras-based Hindu newspaper. Over two years, the Hindu published Swiss banking documents and sensational parts of the audit report. The documents linked the Hindujas to the commissions but the brothers immediately claimed they were false and fabricated. \"Baseless and malicious lies,\" said Gopichand (GP) Hinduja, who with his brother Srichand (SP) had by then established the headquarters of their multimillion business empire in London. But the audit report was devastating. It had found \"entirely proven commission payments to companies/accounts in Switzerland in relation to the Bofors deal.\" It went on: \"[That] these payments unquestionably relate to this deal is based on the fact that this has been communicated in writing by A B Bofors to the Bank of Sweden.\" The details of the three Hinduja accounts identified by the Swedes and the money transferred coincided exactly with the Swiss documents that eventually would be released in Geneva 10 years later. The Hindu also published extracts from the personal diary of Martin Ardbo, the former president of Bofors, in which Rajiv Gandhi was personally implicated. The sleaze was too much for the Indian electorate and in the elections of 1989 Gandhi and the Congress party were decisively defeated. Faced with such prima facia evidence, the Indian central bureau of investigaton began to show its mettle. On February 7 1990, it requested banking documents from the Swiss authorities. Two weeks later both G P and SP Hinduja, then assiduously courting Tory politicians, made their first unsuccessful applications for British passports. For the next seven years vigorous attempts were made to block the Swiss legal process. In 1992 the Indian foreign minister was forced to resign after it was revealed that he had surreptitiously asked the Swiss to stop the inquiries. The first decision by the Swiss courts to release the documents in 1993 led to Quattrocchi fleeing to Malaysia where he was arrested last December and awaits an extradition hearing. In 1997 the first batch of documents were ceremoniously handed over to the Indians and at the end of 1999 the first CBI charge sheet named Rajiv Gandhi, Quattrocchi, the agent W N 'Win' Chadha, Martin Arbdo of Bofors and the former defence minister, S K Bhatnagar, as criminal conspirators. The Hindujas were left to fight on but their final appeal against disclosure was dismissed in August 1999. As a last shot they petitioned Ruth Metzler, the Swiss federal councillor, asking her to stop the process on the grounds that the legal assistance to India might \"injure the sovereignty, the public order or other essential interests of Switzerland'.\" The petition was dismissed two months later. By that time, both GP and SP had their British passports granted in November 1997 and March 1999. The second batch of Swiss papers duly arrived in India in December 1999 and last October the brothers were named on a supplementary charge sheet. There was speculation that the new British nationals might have to be extradited but last month they flew to Delhi for hours of questioning by the CBI. The police described their explanations as \"evasive\" and the court refused them permission to leave the country. The brothers have not yet been formally charged but a reader of the robust Indian press might think they had already been convicted. The suggestion is, if there was nothing to hide, why did successive Indian governments, Bofors and the brothers themselves go to such elaborate and expensive lengths to keep the L'affaire Bofors under wraps?",

      "body": "<p>With its ornate balconies and air of eccentric majesty, the old palace in Bhuj used to be the town's star tourist attraction. </p> <p>Built in the early 18th century by a formidable princely ruler, Maharajah Lakhpatji, Bhuj's palace delighted in an architectural style unique in India, and showed the influence of the Moorish traders who came to Bhuj from far across the sea. But last week the palace suffered a terrible blow. The earthquake that flattened the town in Gujarat state saved its worst destruction for the old quarter, for its narrow alleys, tightly packed shops and the palace itself. </p> <p>\"One has to face reality,\" the current maharajah's now homeless cousin, Raghurajsinh Jabeja, said yesterday, sitting on a chair in a palace courtyard strewn with rubble. </p> <p>\"As much as one would like to see it restored, it is a Herculean task. We are trying to save as much as we can but so much has fallen down.\" </p> <p>The palace's ceremonial arch to his right, 50 yards away, had half collapsed. Its dome lies upside down in a mountain of old masonry and dust. \"The entire arch may have to be partly demolished, \" Mr Jabeja said. </p> <p>Many of the palace's lovely balconies - from where the womenfolk would have watched the world through wooden shutters - have survived. But the colonnaded square where Mr Jabeja used to play as a boy is filled with shattered teak beams. </p> <p>\"I was born here. So were my father and grandfather,\" he said. </p> <p>The eunuchs' quarters have been destroyed. The last eunuch belonging to the court died as late as 1965. \"We used eunuchs to guard the treasury along with local staff and Arab mercenary soldiers. Eunuchs were considered loyal because they did not have families.\" Mr Jabeja said. </p> <p>The large ceiling tiles in the palace's subterranean passageways are now perilously loose. Mr Jabeja and the maharajah's brother, Ghanysham Singh, have not yet ventured into the palace's museum which used to attract 75 to 100 foreign tourists a day. The curator who has the keys has been busy, tending to his daughter who was injured in the quake. </p> <p>The museum included the old maharajah's personal living quarters walled with dozens of decaying gilt mirrors, together with a collection of armour, turbans, coins, clocks and bad European art. \"We suspect the 18th century collection of European glassware may have been totally damaged,\" Mr Singh said. </p> <p>The music room with its ornamental fountain, where Lakhpatji used to compose poetry surrounded by dancing girls, is also in poor shape. </p> <p>The two brothers were the only people inside the palace a week ago when the tremors started. \"I had taken a bath. I knew immediately it was an earthquake. I ran outside and stood under the doorframe. I could hear the girders come crashing down around me. I was saved by the will of God,\" Mr Singh said. </p> <p>The present maharajah, who lives his life mostly in Bombay and London, was in Bhuj but not in the palace at the time of the quake. He survived the destruction in the town. An elderly man, he has no children. </p> <p>The history of the palace - the only building of architectural significance damaged in the catastrophic earthquake that took at least 20,000 lives in western India when it struck on January 26 - is also the history of Kutch, the barren and alluring desert region in Gujarat. During the monsoon season Kutch becomes an island fiefdom, encircled by water. </p> <p>The palace has long been associated with intrigue. An early maharajah, Raydhanji II, who converted to Islam under the influence of an Arab holy man, was imprisoned by courtiers for his whole 75-year reign, Mr Jabeja said. Raydhanji is said to have roamed the building at night, sword drawn and holding a candle, shouting \"Hail be to Allah!\". </p> <p>Another boy prince who joked that a tubby local chieftain might be hanged from the palace's elm tree was swiftly deposed in a coup. This experience of civil strife led, inevitably, to the arrival of the British. </p> <p>The first British adventurer to reach Kutch, Captain MacMurdo, came disguised as a sadhu or holy man. But in 1819 an army regiment blasted through the walls and Kutch followed other areas of Gujarat in being brought under the administration of the British East India Company. </p> <p>That same year the last great earthquake hit Bhuj, destroying 7,000 houses and killing 1,000 people. The maharajahs survived but when India became independent in 1947 they were divested of their powers. </p> <p>Last night it was not clear who, if anybody, would take on the bill for restoration of the palace, estimated off the cuff at \u00a33.5m. </p> <p>\"We don't want the money for ourselves. And we don't particularly want it from the Indian government. But we would like it with no strings attached, \" Mr Singh said. </p> <p>One suspects that unless a generous benefactor comes forward to rescue the beautiful but broken palace, the maharajahs of Bhuj have, after 500 turbulent years, reached the end of the line. </p> <p><strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/giving/donate/donform.asp?app=\" india\"\">Unicef</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Graphic</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

      "bodyText": "President George Bush has taken the first step towards making the overthrow of Saddam Hussein an explicit goal of US policy on Iraq, a move which could cause a significant split within his new team. The Bush administration has issued an order permitting Iraqi opposition groups to begin limited moves inside Iraq using US government funding. The decision followed a meeting on Iraq policy at the White House on Tuesday, chaired by Mr Bush. The moves are limited to a programme described as the \"collection of informational materials\", but they signal further steps in the same direction and cross a line in the sand which the Clinton administration was exceptionally reluctant to pass. The new order allows the Iraqi National Congress (INC) - the main umbrella opposition group in the north of the country - to draw on $4m (\u00a32.7m) which was authorised by the US Congress late last year, to compile information inside Iraq relating to Baghdad's war crimes, military operations and other internal developments. It marks the first time since 1996 that the US has directly funded Iraqi opposition activities inside Iraq itself. Further orders not yet authorised would permit the INC to use US funds to open a permanent centre of operations in northern Iraq, where overt activities would include the publication of a newspaper and other propaganda. The INC then wants to tap into a further $12m to establish a distribution system for food, medicine and other humanitarian relief efforts inside parts of Iraq still under the control of President Saddam. The new order is a clear sign that the Bush administration intends to push US policy towards Iraq in a different direction from the containment policy followed by President Clinton and US allies including Britain. But first the new administration must resolve an internal power struggle between the secretary of state, Colin Powell, who favours caution and containment, and the Pentagon chief, Donald Rumsfeld, who is a supporter of active engagement in support of the Iraqi opposition. Asked this week about Iraq policy, Mr Powell said: \"Iraq is a problem for its own people,\" and described the situation in the region as \"an arms control problem\" involving weapons of mass destruction. \"They made a commitment to do away with those weapons and I think the international community and the United Nations has to hold them to that commitment,\" Mr Powell said. However, that view is not necessarily shared so strongly by the Bush administration's more hawkish members and advisers, including Mr Rumsfeld and the vice president, Dick Cheney. An INC official was reported yesterday to have said that the new money would enable it to extend its operations within as little as two weeks. The US funds could pay for some 40 INC agents to develop their networks within Iraq, linking up with thousands of sympathisers, the official said.",

What she found in the secluded house three miles from one of the leading universities in the United States were the bodies of Susanne and Half Zantop, lying in their own blood.</p> <p>The couple, advocates of liberal causes at Dartmouth College, which has a reputation as one of the more Waspish conservative Ivy League schools, had been killed for, well, what? If the police know, they are not saying.</p> <p>The two professors seem to have been well liked, loved even, by the friends, colleagues and students who will be at their memorial service in Hanover, New Hampshire, today. They had a large social circle, helped and counselled those in need, and performed quiet acts of charity from their home, set among barns and stone walls in the village of Etna.</p> <p>Hanover is a close-knit community of 9,600 where everybody knows everybody else, most have some connection with the campus, and people take pride in not having to lock their doors. At least, that was the case until the Zantops, German immigrants born during the second world war, were killed. Sadly, the couple were among those who did make a habit of locking up when they were home.</p> <p>\"These are the two most remarkable people we knew,\" said Phil Pochoda, an associate director of the University Press of New England.</p> <p>\"How can they be the only two people that fate would obliterate? The thought that we would go on without them is now inconceivable.\"</p> <p>Zantop, 62 and his wife, 55, arrived separately in the US in pursuit of opportunities not available in Germany to people of their generation, friends said.

      "bodyText": "When Roxana Verona arrived at her friends' home for dinner she thought she knew what to expect there: strong margaritas mixed to a special recipe and conversation bridging the shores of academia and popular culture. But she was wrong. What she found in the secluded house three miles from one of the leading universities in the United States were the bodies of Susanne and Half Zantop, lying in their own blood. The couple, advocates of liberal causes at Dartmouth College, which has a reputation as one of the more Waspish conservative Ivy League schools, had been killed for, well, what? If the police know, they are not saying. The two professors seem to have been well liked, loved even, by the friends, colleagues and students who will be at their memorial service in Hanover, New Hampshire, today. They had a large social circle, helped and counselled those in need, and performed quiet acts of charity from their home, set among barns and stone walls in the village of Etna. Hanover is a close-knit community of 9,600 where everybody knows everybody else, most have some connection with the campus, and people take pride in not having to lock their doors. At least, that was the case until the Zantops, German immigrants born during the second world war, were killed. Sadly, the couple were among those who did make a habit of locking up when they were home. \"These are the two most remarkable people we knew,\" said Phil Pochoda, an associate director of the University Press of New England. \"How can they be the only two people that fate would obliterate? The thought that we would go on without them is now inconceivable.\" Zantop, 62 and his wife, 55, arrived separately in the US in pursuit of opportunities not available in Germany to people of their generation, friends said. He wanted more than his father's box-making business; she wanted an academic career. They met at Stanford University in California and Zantop's work as a geologist for mining companies took them to Central America, Argentina and Spain before they settled in Hanover 25 years ago, where he took a job in the earth sciences department. She was a late starter who did not earn her Harvard doctorate until 1984, the year she took a post at Dartmouth. She began in the Spanish department, changed to German, and became chairwoman of that department five years ago. She was considered one of the leading German studies scholars in the US. In addition, she taught women's studies and comparative literature. \"It's pretty extraordinary for someone who got her PhD at a later age to have such a stellar career,\" Susannah Heschel, head of Jewish studies at Dartmouth, said. This is by no means the only aspect of the lives and deaths of the Zantops considered extraordinary. Jourdan Abel, a second-year Dartmouth student from Miami, said: \"I'm from a big city where tons of people get killed every week and no one really cares. But there's this feeling that this is the perfect school, the perfect town. It's like something has disturbed our perfectness. \"Yesterday my room-mates and I locked the door while we were in our room. That's definitely a new thing.\" Murder, if not a new thing in Hanover, is rare. There have been only two cases in the past 50 years, and local people are finding the authorities' refusal to give much away about the Zantop case frustrating. It was five days after their death before the New Hampshire attorney general, Philip McLaughlin, was prepared to concede that they had been stabbed, and even then he would not speculate on the weapon. \"It's probable that the person or persons who entered their home were probably let into their home,\" he said. \"We are also told that the Zantops were very generous and might have let a stranger into the home.\" Earlier had said little more than that there was no need to panic, and that he did not want to disclose too much for fear of prejudicing a trial.

Veronika Zantop, 29, and her sister Mariana, 27, will be at today's memorial service, a week after their parents performed one of their final characteristic acts: they emailed friends asking them to oppose John Ashcroft, President Bush's nominee for US attorney general and a bete noir of the left.

Despite the efforts of his minders to repackage him as a peacemaker by restricting interviews and banning a debate with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, Mr Sharon raised hackles this week in Egypt and Jordan, the two countries which have peace agreements with the Jewish state. Mr Sharon's soft new image has also been undermined by pronouncements from extreme rightwing allies - potential cabinet ministers in the next government - that he would be prepared to bomb Tehran and Cairo. After engaging in a spat with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, Mr Sharon compounded his blunder by claiming that Jordanian officials had confessed to him their secret fears that their country would be swallowed up by a Palestinian state stretching from the edges of Tel Aviv to Iraq. The Palestinians, too, appear unnerved by the implications of a Sharon victory. Despite the deaths of more than 320 Palestinians during the four-month uprising, Mr Sharon has repeatedly criticised Mr Barak for not cracking down hard enough on protesters. Earlier this week, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abd Rabbo, called Mr Sharon a \"rabid and dangerous\" man with \"hostile intentions to reopen a wider conflict\". Leading Mr Barak by 17 to 21 percentage points in yesterday's opinion polls, Mr Sharon does not want to see a near certain victory snatched from his grasp by Israeli fears of a regional war. On Thursday, he told a Likud youth rally in Tel Aviv: \"I know Arabs and they know me. They take me at my word; they know my yes is yes, and my no is no, and they know I say exactly what I think.

      "body": "<p>When Tony Blair faced the Peter Mandelson crisis he was tackling a problem that is emerging to dominate organisations - how to manage talent. Even Mandelson's enemies acknowledge his role in turning Labour from an unelectable political relic to the dominant force in modern UK politics. His achievements can be compared with any industrialist who has transformed a fading enterprise.</p> <p>The modern economy is not the e-conomy, even the knowledge economy but the talent or T-conomy. The formula for success is R(KxT)=S, where R is resources, K is knowledge, T is talent and S is success. The link between knowledge and talent decides the returns from any given amount of resource.</p> <p>Competition for talent is a battleground for all types of organisations. Leaders are judged by their ability to spot and get the best from talent. This is especially true in knowledge-based organisations where most of the value is generated by talent not cap ital equipment. Managing talent is different to managing other resources. Highly talented people do not operate by the same rules. Typically they change or reject rules. This willingness to rethink ideas, challenge convention or rewrite the rules is central to their appeal.</p> <p>The talent paradox is that managers recruit gifted people for these capabilities, but strive to impose rules and structures upon people whose greatest value may lie in challenging rules, systems and structures. Little wonder that control oriented managers and bureaucrats find them awkward and difficult.</p> <p>Traditionally, the balance of power lay with managers and organisations. Switching jobs was hard. The security of a pension could make the most creative person sit tight.</p> <p>The dot.com revolution changed this. New companies offered capital gains that compensated for lost pension rights. The pattern set among internet firms spread rapidly. Banks, consultants, retailers, the leisure industries, media companies, other service businesses and ambitious manufacturers saw the link between knowledge, talent and success.</p> <p>New management strategies are needed, underpinned by strong and supportive relationships. Equally important are mutually agreed boundaries and effective mentoring. These can only be built on negotiated outcomes, not imposed processes.</p> <p>These systems are crucial in overcoming the Icarus effect after the character in Greek legend who built wings that enabled him and his son to fly, but in flying too close to the sun was destroyed.</p> <p>Talent can behave in the same way. Gifted people can believe they are inviolable, take too many risks or simply ignore warning signs. Organisations that want their abilities need systems to handle these risks.</p> <p>Many of these systems are surprisingly easy to design and develop. The three Rs of talent management are Recognition, Resources and Reinforcement.</p> <p>There are two aspects of recognition. First, recognise that managing talent is different and rethink approaches to accommodate this.

      "bodyText": "When Tony Blair faced the Peter Mandelson crisis he was tackling a problem that is emerging to dominate organisations - how to manage talent. Even Mandelson's enemies acknowledge his role in turning Labour from an unelectable political relic to the dominant force in modern UK politics. His achievements can be compared with any industrialist who has transformed a fading enterprise. The modern economy is not the e-conomy, even the knowledge economy but the talent or T-conomy. The formula for success is R(KxT)=S, where R is resources, K is knowledge, T is talent and S is success. The link between knowledge and talent decides the returns from any given amount of resource. Competition for talent is a battleground for all types of organisations. Leaders are judged by their ability to spot and get the best from talent. This is especially true in knowledge-based organisations where most of the value is generated by talent not cap ital equipment. Managing talent is different to managing other resources. Highly talented people do not operate by the same rules. Typically they change or reject rules. This willingness to rethink ideas, challenge convention or rewrite the rules is central to their appeal. The talent paradox is that managers recruit gifted people for these capabilities, but strive to impose rules and structures upon people whose greatest value may lie in challenging rules, systems and structures. Little wonder that control oriented managers and bureaucrats find them awkward and difficult. Traditionally, the balance of power lay with managers and organisations. Switching jobs was hard. The security of a pension could make the most creative person sit tight. The dot.com revolution changed this. New companies offered capital gains that compensated for lost pension rights. The pattern set among internet firms spread rapidly. Banks, consultants, retailers, the leisure industries, media companies, other service businesses and ambitious manufacturers saw the link between knowledge, talent and success. New management strategies are needed, underpinned by strong and supportive relationships. Equally important are mutually agreed boundaries and effective mentoring. These can only be built on negotiated outcomes, not imposed processes. These systems are crucial in overcoming the Icarus effect after the character in Greek legend who built wings that enabled him and his son to fly, but in flying too close to the sun was destroyed. Talent can behave in the same way. Gifted people can believe they are inviolable, take too many risks or simply ignore warning signs. Organisations that want their abilities need systems to handle these risks. Many of these systems are surprisingly easy to design and develop. The three Rs of talent management are Recognition, Resources and Reinforcement. There are two aspects of recognition. First, recognise that managing talent is different and rethink approaches to accommodate this. Second, recognise and acknowledge individual contributions - constantly. Adequate resources are vital in retaining the enthusiasm and commitment of talent. A sense of worth and control can reinforce the feeling of value that helps people to realise their potential. Reinforcing the importance and value of talent becomes a key leadership role. Tony Blair claimed that the New Labour project would not be completed until the party learned to love Peter Mandelson. The pleasure in so many quarters at his fall suggests that the Prime Minister failed in this, with unknown costs to his government. Professor Tom Cannon is chief executive of RespectLondon",

At issue is the purchase of planes, ships and submarines from European countries, including Britain. The investigation was ordered after the auditor general said there may have been kickbacks and nepotism in the awarding of contracts, and raised questions about the skyrocketing cost of the huge deal. The ANC's leadership's handling of the crisis has only deepened public suspicions and undermined the confidence of some of its MPs. The party has tried to paint a leading judge as racist, and tried to get its own members of parliament to water down the inquiry. Mr Mbeki also made a bizarre TV address in which he wrongly accused investigators of smearing Nelson Mandela. The president's advisers continue to insist there is no scandal. But the defence minister, Mosiuoa Lekota, has conceded that ANC MPs have accused some fellow parliamentarians of taking bribes to influence the arms deal. It was \"not impossible\", he said, that senior politicians took kickbacks. \"No one will invest in a country which is perceived as essentially corrupt. Suddenly this government is accused of stealing money from the populace,\" he said. \"The South African government must get rid of this image that it stole money from the people. We must get rid of it.\" Two weeks ago, Mr Mbeki was accused of riding roughshod over democracy by rejecting a demand from parliament for a leading investigative judge, Willem Heath, and his special investigations unit to join an inquiry into alleged graft in the arms deal. Last week the party removed one of its most highly rated MPs, Andrew Feinstein, as head of a public accounts oversight committee. He strongly wanted Mr Heath in the arms inquiry. Three other agencies are to take part, but they are said to lack the investigative powers of the Heath unit. Then the ANC said that its chief whip, Tony Yengeni, would \"sit in\" on investigation meetings even though he is listed among the suspects. When the cry of foul went up from the opposition, church leaders and a good deal of public opinion, the government responded by trying to paint Mr Heath as a cowboy who refuses to hold himself accountable to the executive. Mr Mbeki demanded that the judge give the justice ministry whatever evidence of graft he already had. Mr Heath refused, saying it would be irregular to give such infor mation to government officials, some of whom may be implicated. To do so \"would jeopardise the investigation, lead to victimisation of whistle-blowers and threaten the lives of potential witnesses\". On television, Mr Mbeki said the judge was \"out of control\". He also produced a diagram which he claimed came from Mr Heath's files and was evidence that the judge was trying to implicate Nelson Mandela in corruption. The move backfired: Mr Heath said he had never seen the document; it proved to be the work of an investigative journalist who said it merely showed the links between leading politicians and South African firms that have won contracts under the arms deal. A few days later, the government leaked a letter from senior black members of the special investigations unit alleging that there had been \"lack of transformation\" under Mr Heath, a coded way of saying he is racist.",

Everyone else in financial services has been doing the same, for once this year's opportunity to get tax relief on \u00a37,000 worth of new investment is gone, the allowance will go to waste. But investment trusts have an advantage. The industry's \"its\" advertising campaign, designed to demystify the business, has proved a controversial, success in its first incarnation, doubling sales to private investors in the six months to the end of the present tax year. Now the campaign has come out of cold storage, as the trusts spend \u00a38m on press and television advertising. Many have even started paying commission to independent financial advisers at the same rates as on unit trusts. The \"its\" campaign may be wacky but many people are wary of the trusts, partly because they are complex and, more importantly, can involve higher risks than unit trusts. Unit trust mechanics are easy: the value of your holding rises and falls in line with the underlying assets the trust happens to hold. In contrast, putting money into an investment trust means buying its shares, and there is no direct link between the share price and the value of the assets the trust hold. Only supply and demand shifts in the share price decide what your holding is worth.

      "body": "<p>When, back in 1995, corporate bonds were finally allowed into the Pep fold, they proved immensely popular, mainly because of the high tax-free yield they offered.</p> <p>Six years on, investors holding corporate bond funds within Isas can still save 40% of yields currently averaging 7.5% if they are higher rate taxpayers.</p> <p>But those same funds spent most of last year in the doldrums. So do corporate bond Isas still represent good value? Or are savers being lured by the tax breaks into a poor investment?</p> <p>The answer needs an understanding of how corporate bonds are measured. As with equities, their performance is ranked in terms of total return - the change in capital value plus all income received. Bondholders generally expect to get most of the return in the form of income.</p> <p>And while the level of income a bond pays out should be stable, its capital value fluctuates according to market views on inflation, interest rates, and how well the company itself is doing.</p> <p>\"Last year was a year of two halves,\" says John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&amp;G. \"Until August bonds were not doing very well, because investors were buying government-issued gilts.</p> <p>\"But then in August the government announced that pension funds were allowed to buy corporate bonds in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements. That was enough to raise corporate bond prices.\"</p> <p>That led to a strong rally and by the year's end the total return on M&amp;G's corporate bond fund was 7%. Of this, 6.1% came in the second half. The average bond fund returned 4.7%. This compares with a total return for the average unit trust of -6.9%.</p> <p>But the story was different for junk bonds with their lower credit rating, based on a higher chance of default on loan interest and capital. Junk weakened last summer as the British economy slowed down and the market feared increased defaults.</p> <p>Over the year, the M&amp;G high yield bond fund (which holds 60% sub-investment grade bonds, such as Orange and Colt Telecom) returned -1.9%. Advisers say investors need to understand what they're buying, and to pitch their choice according to their risk profile.</p> <p>\"There are some very safe corporate bond funds, and some aggressive funds,\"says John Pattullo, corporate bond manager with Henderson Global Investors. \"There is a myth that corporate bonds are risky, but they are generally safer than equities, as they rank before them in any payout to creditors.

      "bodyText": "When, back in 1995, corporate bonds were finally allowed into the Pep fold, they proved immensely popular, mainly because of the high tax-free yield they offered. Six years on, investors holding corporate bond funds within Isas can still save 40% of yields currently averaging 7.5% if they are higher rate taxpayers. But those same funds spent most of last year in the doldrums. So do corporate bond Isas still represent good value? Or are savers being lured by the tax breaks into a poor investment? The answer needs an understanding of how corporate bonds are measured. As with equities, their performance is ranked in terms of total return - the change in capital value plus all income received. Bondholders generally expect to get most of the return in the form of income. And while the level of income a bond pays out should be stable, its capital value fluctuates according to market views on inflation, interest rates, and how well the company itself is doing. \"Last year was a year of two halves,\" says John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&amp;G. \"Until August bonds were not doing very well, because investors were buying government-issued gilts. \"But then in August the government announced that pension funds were allowed to buy corporate bonds in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements. That was enough to raise corporate bond prices.\" That led to a strong rally and by the year's end the total return on M&amp;G's corporate bond fund was 7%. Of this, 6.1% came in the second half. The average bond fund returned 4.7%. This compares with a total return for the average unit trust of -6.9%. But the story was different for junk bonds with their lower credit rating, based on a higher chance of default on loan interest and capital. Junk weakened last summer as the British economy slowed down and the market feared increased defaults. Over the year, the M&amp;G high yield bond fund (which holds 60% sub-investment grade bonds, such as Orange and Colt Telecom) returned -1.9%. Advisers say investors need to understand what they're buying, and to pitch their choice according to their risk profile. \"There are some very safe corporate bond funds, and some aggressive funds,\"says John Pattullo, corporate bond manager with Henderson Global Investors. \"There is a myth that corporate bonds are risky, but they are generally safer than equities, as they rank before them in any payout to creditors. They are fine for people who are retired, and don't need capital growth, but a safe and reliable income flow.\" Mark Bolland of independent financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe says: \"I suspect a lot of people have corporate bonds in their port folio when they shouldn't have. The real reason they're there is to provide income. We've got clients who have built up their Pep portfolios to \u00a3130,000. With a yield just over 6%, they get \u00a38,000, so higher rate taxpayers are saving \u00a33,200.\" Mr Bolland also points out that non-taxpayers with equity and fixed interest investments may be better off choosing to hold the equity funds in an Isa, and the fixed interest investments outside. \"As a non-taxpayer, you can reclaim the tax on income from fixed interest investments, but you can't reclaim the tax credit from equities unless they're in an Isa.\" But he warns that investors should always do their investment calculations first, and work out the tax implications afterwards. \"The tax aspect should be a side-effect, not the main reason for investing.\" But even if all the fundamental reasons are there, is now the right time to be getting into corporate bonds? \"There is a strong possibility that interest rates will be cut after the next Bank of England meeting,\" says Mr Hatherly. \"This makes deposit-based investments less attractive, and we might see switches to alternative sources of income, such as corporate bond funds.\"",

The irony of all this is that the arena where the Magic play is found in the most depressed part of Orlando, the deprived, decayed and exclusively black ghetto of Passmore.

      "body": "<p>Christian Karembeu strides out of the changing room, talking in French on a mobile phone and tricked out in a sharp suit smacking of catwalk couture. His team-mates are long gone but, as one of Europe's most decorated footballers, the Middlesbrough midfielder naturally needs extra time to spruce himself up. </p> <p>\"I go home to New Caledonia every three years, but I'm in constant touch with my family,\" the 30-year-old says, glancing towards reception at Boro's Hurworth training ground before joking: \"Mr Venables pays the mobile bill.\" </p> <p>Karembeu's mane of dreadlocked hair gives him the air of Ruud Gullit in his prime and recently his performances have justified the comparison. Yet this afternoon Boro welcome Manchester City, three points below them, to the Riverside for Teesside's latest relegation battle. </p> <p>Such a predicament is alien to a player who has won league titles in Spain and France, two European Cups with Real Madrid, and the World Cup and European Championship with France. In Boro's trophy cabinet, by contrast, the 1976 Anglo-Scottish Cup continues its lonely wait for some meaningful company. </p> <p>Karembeu, admittedly, was hardly an integral part of either the Real Madrid or France teams that won their most recent trophies, although he has 46 caps. However, he stresses other reasons for his move to the north-east. \"I had everything I could ever have wanted in Madrid, apart from a challenge. It is easy to win the title at Real. You can swap the players around but the machine is always working and winning. They have a special word for their culture of victory: madridismo . Coming here was a totally different experience. </p> <p>\"But the first steps have already been taken - Boro have the players, the stadium, the training ground - and I want to be a part of the second stage. We could win the title. Why not?\" </p> <p>Such talk passes over Karembeu's torturous introduction to the Premiership after his \u00a32.3m move, which could serve as a microcosm of Boro's season. Despite a rousing opening-day success at Coventry, the Teessiders quickly nose-dived towards the foot of the table. The Frenchman, groping blindly around midfield, looked alarmingly out of his depth. </p> <p>\"It's very hard to adapt,\" he admits. \"There's less time on the ball; basically it's another sport. At Nantes I learned technique, how to move and create space; in Italy it was more tactical and every player has a quick-thinking, tactical brain. In Spain you got more open games, but here they hit you in the first second.\" </p> <p>From early October there were eight defeats in nine games under Bryan Robson. Karembeu's personal nadir came in the first match of that losing streak. Against Newcastle at the Riverside he cut a forlorn figure, his passing consistently abysmal as he laboured in a spineless formation - \"I worked myself up, didn't sleep a wink the night before and was awful on the day\" - but his display was symptomatic of Boro's malaise. </p> <p>\"It was a mental thing,\" he says. \"We kept losing our concentration. Sometimes two players would go for one ball; other times nobody would go for it at all. When you keep losing every week you steadily forget what it is you are actually good at. </p> <p>\"We were too frightened to play and towards the end of that sequence we had often lost even before the kick-off. Outsiders found it easy to criticise, but we were working, talking and trying to change things with Bryan. Perhaps he trusted us too much, but it is very difficult to manage and one of Bryan's strongest ideas was to bring Mr Venables here.\" </p> <p>The transformation since Terry Venables arrived as coach in December has been staggering. Since a 1-0 defeat at Sunderland grounded them at rock bottom, Boro have been unbeaten in nine matches. Everton's first goal in Wednesday's 2-2 draw was only the third conceded in that period, and the other two were a penalty and an own goal respectively.

      "bodyText": "Christian Karembeu strides out of the changing room, talking in French on a mobile phone and tricked out in a sharp suit smacking of catwalk couture. His team-mates are long gone but, as one of Europe's most decorated footballers, the Middlesbrough midfielder naturally needs extra time to spruce himself up. \"I go home to New Caledonia every three years, but I'm in constant touch with my family,\" the 30-year-old says, glancing towards reception at Boro's Hurworth training ground before joking: \"Mr Venables pays the mobile bill.\" Karembeu's mane of dreadlocked hair gives him the air of Ruud Gullit in his prime and recently his performances have justified the comparison. Yet this afternoon Boro welcome Manchester City, three points below them, to the Riverside for Teesside's latest relegation battle. Such a predicament is alien to a player who has won league titles in Spain and France, two European Cups with Real Madrid, and the World Cup and European Championship with France. In Boro's trophy cabinet, by contrast, the 1976 Anglo-Scottish Cup continues its lonely wait for some meaningful company. Karembeu, admittedly, was hardly an integral part of either the Real Madrid or France teams that won their most recent trophies, although he has 46 caps. However, he stresses other reasons for his move to the north-east. \"I had everything I could ever have wanted in Madrid, apart from a challenge. It is easy to win the title at Real. You can swap the players around but the machine is always working and winning. They have a special word for their culture of victory: madridismo . Coming here was a totally different experience. \"But the first steps have already been taken - Boro have the players, the stadium, the training ground - and I want to be a part of the second stage. We could win the title. Why not?\" Such talk passes over Karembeu's torturous introduction to the Premiership after his \u00a32.3m move, which could serve as a microcosm of Boro's season. Despite a rousing opening-day success at Coventry, the Teessiders quickly nose-dived towards the foot of the table. The Frenchman, groping blindly around midfield, looked alarmingly out of his depth. \"It's very hard to adapt,\" he admits. \"There's less time on the ball; basically it's another sport. At Nantes I learned technique, how to move and create space; in Italy it was more tactical and every player has a quick-thinking, tactical brain. In Spain you got more open games, but here they hit you in the first second.\" From early October there were eight defeats in nine games under Bryan Robson. Karembeu's personal nadir came in the first match of that losing streak. Against Newcastle at the Riverside he cut a forlorn figure, his passing consistently abysmal as he laboured in a spineless formation - \"I worked myself up, didn't sleep a wink the night before and was awful on the day\" - but his display was symptomatic of Boro's malaise. \"It was a mental thing,\" he says. \"We kept losing our concentration. Sometimes two players would go for one ball; other times nobody would go for it at all. When you keep losing every week you steadily forget what it is you are actually good at. \"We were too frightened to play and towards the end of that sequence we had often lost even before the kick-off. Outsiders found it easy to criticise, but we were working, talking and trying to change things with Bryan. Perhaps he trusted us too much, but it is very difficult to manage and one of Bryan's strongest ideas was to bring Mr Venables here.\" The transformation since Terry Venables arrived as coach in December has been staggering. Since a 1-0 defeat at Sunderland grounded them at rock bottom, Boro have been unbeaten in nine matches. Everton's first goal in Wednesday's 2-2 draw was only the third conceded in that period, and the other two were a penalty and an own goal respectively. Karembeu, too, has rediscovered his sparkle, forging a close relationship with the side's other big-name performer, Alen Boksic. It was the Frenchman's sweeping cross, headed back by Boksic, which enabled Hamilton Ricard to open the scoring at Goodison Park. \"Terry is strong and thorough at repeating details,\" he says. \"We're professionals, but sometimes you need to be reminded of how to approach games. He spoke to every player, telling us what each of our strengths was, and suddenly we can run, we can pass, we can do anything. The defence is more organised and with those foundations in place the game is so much simpler. We have generated a positive energy. Now we believe that we are winners.

      "body": "<p>Bullying is something we like to laugh off as a childhood rite of passage, but according to recent figures, there's a high probability you've seen bullying at close range in more recent years. A study of 5,500 employees by Manchester university UMIST found that almost half had witnessed bullying at work, and one in four had been bullied in the last five years.

A study of 5,500 employees by Manchester university UMIST found that almost half had witnessed bullying at work, and one in four had been bullied in the last five years. In three out of four cases, the boss was to blame. \"Bullying is endemic in the workplace, and it's getting worse,\" says Val Wallace, general manager of anti-bullying charity The Andrea Adams Trust.

      "body": "<p>If you fancy a career in the corridors of power at Brussels or Strasbourg there is a unique opportunity to find out more about studying in Europe later this month - a special fair to promote European integration postgraduate study courses in universities is being held in Brussels on February 17. </p> <p>Graduates who might want to work in the commission or who fancy a career in the private sector but with a strong European flavour will discover that a European intergration studies qualification can be an impressive addition to their CV. </p> <p>And at the fair they can find out what is on offer from universities and academic institutions all over Europe, including the UK, with the knowledge that the courses have been identified by a unit of the European Commission itself </p> <p>This is the second such fair - last year's event attracted 300 students - and it is expected to be even more popular. </p> <p> European Voice, a Brussels-based newspaper which is dedicated entirely to the coverage of European affairs, has teamed up with the European Commission's Action Jean Monnet to organise the fair which is free to all students with an interest in European postgraduate study. </p> <p> The Guardian, along with Belgian newspapers The Bulletin, La Libre Belgique and Le Soir , is sponsoring the event. </p> <p>And to coincide with the Swedish presidency of the EU, Ericsson is a major sponsor along with the University Association for Contemporary European Studies. </p> <p>Part of the role of the Action Jean Monnet unit is to support the promotion of European integration studies in member states and other countries around the world and it holds a database of more than 500 postgraduate study courses in the subject of European intergration. </p> <p>Action Jean Monnet also provides start-up funds for new courses, chairs and modules as long as the academic institution promises to keep its teaching activities going for at least seven years. </p> <p>In the ten years since the start of this project, some 491 Jean Monnet chairs have been established and more than 1,300 new courses have been set up.

      "bodyText": "If you fancy a career in the corridors of power at Brussels or Strasbourg there is a unique opportunity to find out more about studying in Europe later this month - a special fair to promote European integration postgraduate study courses in universities is being held in Brussels on February 17. Graduates who might want to work in the commission or who fancy a career in the private sector but with a strong European flavour will discover that a European intergration studies qualification can be an impressive addition to their CV. And at the fair they can find out what is on offer from universities and academic institutions all over Europe, including the UK, with the knowledge that the courses have been identified by a unit of the European Commission itself This is the second such fair - last year's event attracted 300 students - and it is expected to be even more popular. European Voice, a Brussels-based newspaper which is dedicated entirely to the coverage of European affairs, has teamed up with the European Commission's Action Jean Monnet to organise the fair which is free to all students with an interest in European postgraduate study. The Guardian, along with Belgian newspapers The Bulletin, La Libre Belgique and Le Soir , is sponsoring the event. And to coincide with the Swedish presidency of the EU, Ericsson is a major sponsor along with the University Association for Contemporary European Studies. Part of the role of the Action Jean Monnet unit is to support the promotion of European integration studies in member states and other countries around the world and it holds a database of more than 500 postgraduate study courses in the subject of European intergration. Action Jean Monnet also provides start-up funds for new courses, chairs and modules as long as the academic institution promises to keep its teaching activities going for at least seven years. In the ten years since the start of this project, some 491 Jean Monnet chairs have been established and more than 1,300 new courses have been set up. At least 250,000 students each year are now on Jean Monnet courses in member states as well as the United States, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. \"This is a unique opportunity for students and young professionals to find out exactly which EU study courses are available, to meet programme directors and to decide which courses would be most appropriate for them,\" says Adrian Scally, head of enterprise at the European Voice . \"Our objective is to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to sample what is on offer academically and to prepare them for a career in EU- related professions. The event also includes seminars and workshops to give graduates a more detailed understanding of what a European intergration course can achieve. For example Christopher Burghardt from consulting firm Hill and Knowlton is organising a seminar aimed at giving people a better perspective on the kind of practical experiences they can expect after a course. \"The most popular option is to do an internship in the European Commission,\" he says. An internship or 'stage' in Brussels-speak is a six-month stint working on a specific subject in a directorate general, or with cabinets in the commission. It can often mean working with people at a very senior level. With this experience to call on, European integration students can work directly for the commission or take their inside knowledge into the private sector, working for consultancy practices, law firms, chambers of commerce, think tanks and other companies. Christopher Burghardt, for example progressed through a masters at the College of Europe in Brussels and served an internship at the commission's office in Washington. He is now an account director with Hill and Knowlton in Brussels, advising clients on how EU affairs affect their businesses, on how to promote their interests and how to lobby within the EU for a regulatory framework in which businesses can comfortably operate. His job would have been almost impossible without his integration studies background, he says. A workshop hosted by the University Association for Contemporary European Studies aims to help students understand the nature of European studies and will run twice a day at the fair. There will be three speakers, one who works in the European Commission and also writes on the subject, an academic who teaches European studies in the UK and will giv a UK perspective on the discipline, and a student who has worked for an MEP and is continuing with their European studies. The workshops will also show how European Studies courses have a practical application to careers. www.uaces.org www.european-voice.com/eustudy",

Out of nowhere, someone you've never heard of is saying you've been recommended for a job you hadn't even considered with an organisation you'd never thought of approaching. Within a few weeks you've accepted a job offer and your career worries are over. </p> <p>This is headhunting student-style, and such is the pressure to find graduates, it is no longer anything unusual on higher-ranking campuses. </p> <p>\"People tend to think headhunting only happens at a very senior level,\" says Amanda Powell, head of graduate headhunting at Moloney Search, which claims to be the only organisation finding students in this way. \"But what we have done is take the techniques used for the boardroom and apply them to the junior level. </p> <p>\"We work very closely with clients in defining the sort of person they're looking for, and once we've got the brief we go out and look for them. We're not an agency and we don't have a database of students. We approach tutors on relevant courses and ask them to recommend their most appropriate students, or we network through student unions, JCRs, and student societies, asking people for recommendations.\" </p> <p>Being headhunted when you're still a student can be a shock. \"I was really surprised,\" says Laura Cope, aged 24, who was studying for a BA in French and economics at the University of Durham when the call came. </p> <p>\"It had never occurred to me that headhunting happened to students. At the time, I was doing my finals so I had put jobs to one side in order to focus on my degree. I found out that a friend had recommended me, and although I was initially unsure that I had the right background for the job, which was with Tesco.com, I did pursue it. I'm glad I did because I am very pleased with the situation I am in. </p> <p>\"When you're in the throes of student life you don't really have a picture of what working life is like, and a lot of graduates rush to apply for companies without actually realising what they will be good at. In a way having someone else help with your decision can be very relaxing.\" </p> <p>Apart from the obvious ego trip of being chased rather than having to do the chasing, there are other advantages to being headhunted. </p> <p>\"Because the search company does the first interview, you're much more relaxed because you know that they're not going to be your future employer,\" says Rachel Carr. \"They can see who you really are, whereas with the employer, you are so aware that you're being interviewed that you never really relax. I could also say things - like how I had never considered accountancy - which you wouldn't dream of saying to a prospective employer.\" </p> <p>Laura Cope says: \"I wouldn't call it insider information, but it is definitely useful being able to chat things through with an intermediary. In an ordinary application you wouldn't get the opportunity to speak to people one-on-one until the interview stage. In headhunting you can do it straight away. The other big benefit is missing out on all the form filling at the primary application stage.\" </p> <p>Of course, being approached by a headhunter does not mean that you are going to be offered a job. An initial chat over the phone will be followed by an informal interview, and only then will your name go forward to the company itself. Even then you may have tests to pass and there will always be other candidates to beat at the final interview. </p> <p>However, once your name has gone forward, your chances of getting the job are probably about one in two so you know you are a serious contender. </p> <p>The reason companies use headhunters is to ensure they get exactly the people they need. By gathering recommendations from tutors and leading students, and by interviewing informally over the phone, an experienced headhunter can quickly gauge whether someone has the right mix of personality, interests and abilities. </p> <p>\"We used a headhunter because we were looking for someone who had shown a very specific interest in treasury rather than just finance,\" says Andrew Kirby-Pugh, human resources manager at Tesco, \"and we didn't think we would find them through our conventional recruitment methods. It looks expensive, but the results are so good it is actually cost effective.\" </p> <p>So, if you do want to be headhunted what should you do? \"Extracurricular activities are one of the most important factors,\" says Amanda Powell. \"If you are active in the JCR, the student union, or in sports and social clubs we're much more likely to contact you. Companies want team-players and potential leaders, and extracurricular activities demonstrate this perfectly.\"</p>",

Now, she basically has her pick of top movie roles, and she's been picking up a storm lately. Among others, she played the female leads in the two top-grossing films at America's Christmas box office, What Women Want and Cast Away.

But I didn't work for about 18 months after Mad About You, probably because I wanted to stop for a while and partly because I was sort of spoiled by As Good As It Gets, and there wasn't a part that knocked me out. So by the time this group of movies came up I felt, for the first time in a decade, not exhausted.

You deserve one now, so go to see the gaffer.' God, they stitched me up. </p> <p>\"I knocked on the gaffer's door and gave him my best speech. 'I'm playing regularly now, I've done well and I think I deserve a car.' He killed me: 'A club car? One of the club cars? More like a club bike, you mean'.\" </p> <p>Giggs can smile at his youthful impudence now, because the hot blast of Sir Alex Ferguson's notorious hairdryer treatment taught him a valuable lesson about the mechanics of England's premier club. \"It's fair to say I understood the position after that,\" he says. \"Put it this way: I never went into his office again.\" </p> <p>At the start of next month it will be 10 years since Giggs offered Old Trafford its first tantalising glimpse of his precocious talents. This slip of a lad, all bony elbows and lung-bursting acceleration, had the air crackling with anticipation, although he could not prevent United going down to a 2-0 defeat to Everton. </p> <p>In his next game, two months later, he had the audacity to score the only goal in the Manchester derby. Time and again he slalomed through City's bewildered defence with the grace and carefree abandon that sets apart the select few for whom elegance comes naturally. \"The new George Best,\" roared the red-tops, and the public was smitten. </p> <p>From that opening bud, a hardy perennial has bloomed. This afternoon Everton will again provide the opposition and, apart from Denis Irwin, Giggs is now the longest-serving player on United's payroll, with a testimonial to come next season.

      "bodyText": "Ryan Giggs expects this month to sign a new contract binding him to Manchester United for a cool \u00a32.75m a year, but he can still remember the days when the club that is now the richest in the world would not even give him a Vauxhall Astra. \"I was 17 and I'd played about 20 to 25 games in the first team,\" the Wales winger recalls. \"There were a lot of people getting club cars so I went up to Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce and said: 'Do you think I would be able to get one?' \"They were like: 'Yeah, yeah, no problem. You deserve one now, so go to see the gaffer.' God, they stitched me up. \"I knocked on the gaffer's door and gave him my best speech. 'I'm playing regularly now, I've done well and I think I deserve a car.' He killed me: 'A club car? One of the club cars? More like a club bike, you mean'.\" Giggs can smile at his youthful impudence now, because the hot blast of Sir Alex Ferguson's notorious hairdryer treatment taught him a valuable lesson about the mechanics of England's premier club. \"It's fair to say I understood the position after that,\" he says. \"Put it this way: I never went into his office again.\" At the start of next month it will be 10 years since Giggs offered Old Trafford its first tantalising glimpse of his precocious talents. This slip of a lad, all bony elbows and lung-bursting acceleration, had the air crackling with anticipation, although he could not prevent United going down to a 2-0 defeat to Everton. In his next game, two months later, he had the audacity to score the only goal in the Manchester derby. Time and again he slalomed through City's bewildered defence with the grace and carefree abandon that sets apart the select few for whom elegance comes naturally. \"The new George Best,\" roared the red-tops, and the public was smitten. From that opening bud, a hardy perennial has bloomed. This afternoon Everton will again provide the opposition and, apart from Denis Irwin, Giggs is now the longest-serving player on United's payroll, with a testimonial to come next season. It has been a remarkable decade. United have been transformed from a club wondering when their next championship would be achieved to one dominating the skyline of English football. It has brought him a life among the glitterati, a fleet of high-powered cars and a picture-book house.

Pewsey hams up the boy's idealism something rotten, but then the Foreign Office spooks who warn Larry about honey-traps are similarly caricatured: public school equals poof.

Hasn't it heard nobody's interested in that kind of thing...? A memory: six or seven, visiting a dying uncle. Cocked against his sickbed I flashed my new Swiss Army knife, and fanned the blades, grinning, as if I'd hauled that shine out from some pristine darkness of my own. 'What do you want to show me such things for?' he muttered. I was hurt! I'd thought the gesture would please him. I begin to understand.",

Gary Wills's new preface wafts about half-heartedly; it makes a useful point or two, but looks slapdash. Had you or I presented it as an undergraduate essay, we would have been sent off with a flea in our ear and a stern warning to work harder next time. </p> <p>So you may wonder why you should have this translation. That's easy: it's poetry, and matters of mere comprehension or strict literalism need not detain us. You may well have the Penguin E V Rieu prose translation: use it as a crib. But it is dry in its serviceability, which perhaps fits the austere era in which it was produced (1946). Each age approaches Homer, and particularly the Odyssey , with a kind of astonishment, even gratitude, that the earliest (or second-earliest) narrative text in the history of the world should be so mature, should bespeak such a recognisable range of emotional response. (Whereas, for the sake of comparison, just about everything written before Chaucer in English or Old English, and even chunks of the Iliad , elicits the aggrieved observation \"Christ, this is primitive\".) So every version of the poem is a snapshot of the fully engaged poetic sensibility of the day. </p> <p>Chapman was Shakespeare's contemporary: he might not have been as good - who was? - but he was playing in the same ballpark. At times, noticing the epic sustainability of his verse, you get the feeling that he occupies a point on an imaginary line between Shakespeare and Milton; it's from the most vibrant literary heritage this country, and perhaps the world, ever produced. Here is Alcinous, king of the fun-loving Phaeacians, in Rieu's version: \"To any man with the slightest claim to common sense, a stranger and a suppliant is as good as a brother.\" And here's Chapman: \"A Guest, and suppliant, too, we should esteeme / Deare as our brother; / one that doth but dreame / He hath a soule, or touch but at a mind / Deathlesse and manly, should stand so enclin'd.\" </p> <p>Chapman has attracted the epithet \"gnarled\", but there is real beauty in those lines. And sometimes it is important to go for the twisty, gnarled version. You may wonder why you should read this when you haven't even got round to looking at anything on the latest Booker or Whitbread shortlists; look on it as practising for a game of pool in the pub by playing on a full-size snooker table.

My nine-year-old daughter is as enthralled as I was by the adventures of Katy Carr, defying her prissy Aunt Izzy and always getting into scrapes, Jo March, determined to become a writer, and the feral Mary Lennox, restoring bloom to the secret garden. Like me before her, she never questions why these wild, rebellious girls grow up to be such sweet, submissive women - why Katy's fall from the swing, subsequent paralysis and miraculous cure (certainly not one known to medical science) also brings about an astonishing change of personality in which the wild Katy is permanently tamed. Or why after the death of Beth in Good Wives , the sequel to Little Women , Jo sacrifices her ambitions and settles down with a duster and the dull, middle-aged Professor Bhaer. </p> <p>Death, disability and cure, suggests Lois Keith, were pivotal to the novels of the golden age of literature for girls and young women that spanned the mid-19th century to the late-Edwardian period. The women writers of the era - Louisa May Alcott, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Joanna Spyri and Ethel Turner, whose 1894 Seven Little Australians is still read worldwide - were brutal. They killed off their characters, or had them endure disability, particularly paralysing illness during their adolescent years followed by miraculous and generally improbable cures as womanhood approached, just so that they and their sisters could learn to be good, submissive little women. </p> <p>Gentle Helen Burns in Jane Eyre and sweet Beth in Little Women must die so that the emotionally unruly protagonists Jane and Jo can be redeemed through their example of suffering and resignation. Similarly Katy Carr, Clara in Heidi and even the strongly feminised Colin in The Secret Garden overcome their natures and disability to take their dead mothers' places. Katy first comes downstairs on her deceased mother's birthday, Clara steps metaphorically into her dead mother's shoes, and Colin's father gasps when he finds his son walking in the garden, such is Colin's resemblance to his wife. </p> <p>Disability as a punishment for boisterousness or a lack of femininity would seem to be a particularly Victorian way of thinking, but Keith argues that while attitudes to women may have changed substantially over the past 100 years, our attitudes to disability are still stuck in the past. We may now dismiss the moral lessons of these books as they apply to women, but we unquestionably accept what they tell us about disability: \"(1) there is nothing good about being disabled; (2) disabled people have to learn the same qualities of submissive behaviour that women have always had to learn: patience, cheerfulness and making the best of things; (3) impairment can be a punishment for bad behaviour, for evil thoughts, for not being a good enough person; (4) although disabled people should be pitied rather than punished, they can never be accepted; and (5) the impairment is curable. If you want to enough, if you love yourself enough (but not more than you love others), if you believe in God enough, you will be cured.\" Keith argues the latter case particularly well, pointing to the continued popularity of the \"overcoming\" story. Clara is cured in Heidi because, according to Grandad, \"she's made the effort and won the day\". </p> <p>Newspapers are full of admiring stories about the actor Christopher Reeve, paralysed in an accident, who refuses to accept life in a wheelchair and focuses on hopes of a cure in the future; many subscribe to self-help philosophies arguing that the individual is responsible for illness and can cure him or herself. Keith tartly points out that more mysterious conditions such as paralysis and cancer are particularly prone to this interpretation, but few attempt to cure chickenpox with willpower. </p> <p>After an enthralling start, the book and its arguments slightly tail off, not least because Keith writes much more robustly and cogently about the classic books than she does about more recent fictions. But in part it is because Keith, who is disabled herself, is surprisingly forgiving of writers' continuing inability to accept that disabled people live fulfilled lives, and their reliance on murder and miracles. She seems resigned to the fact that disabled people will continue to be relegated to the realm of metaphor. This is a good book, but a little more of Jane Eyre's anger, Jo March's indignation and Katy Carr's militancy would have made it a better one.</p>",

While Tobias Hill's first novel, Underground , united the clamour of contemporary London with a childhood in rural Poland, The Love of Stones brings together a modern-day search for a triplet of rubies known as the Three Brethren with a historical narrative that traces the jewel's passage across two continents and six centuries. </p> <p>At first, it's hard going.

As the treasure trail leads her to Turkey, London and Tokyo, her painstaking observations relate just about everything she does or sees, which allows Hill to impress with moments of poetry. He is adept at rendering cities, especially their cheap hotels and tawdriness, which he plays off against the pristine jewel to good effect.

Hill takes us from the seedy glamour of back-street traders and the smoke and wet sawdust of inns to the murkiness of small jewellery workshops: \"congealed in the cold, a tin of olive oil and diamond dust. A dish of jeweller's rouge and a polishing cloth.\" These and similar passages read like embedded poems: London is \"the stink of oystershells. Rain and light. Halls of smog\". </p> <p>Yet at other times, especially in Sterne's narration, Hill opts for a steady, often cumbersome accretion of detail when a single metaphor may have sufficed. Here, his devotion to verisimilitude is surprising for a published poet. Worst of all, Hill can impede the dramatic intensity of a scene with an occasional portentous phrase (the Brethren is \"an eye opening in a dead head\"). </p> <p>In the 19th-century sections, the book picks up the factually based story of the Levy brothers, Jewish jewellers from Iraq, who came to London to set up shop with the Brethren sewn into the lining of their clothes. They eventually designed Queen Victoria's crown, and were forced into poverty when their stones were taken and they were not paid. Their fate exemplifies the moral of the story: everyone who has possessed the stones has soon lost them. Whether a signifier of imperialism, money, power or greed, the Brethren defies ownership. </p> <p>Throughout the book, Hill relays the suspense of every meeting involving these ill-fated stones, and the filmic moment of disclosure - the box opening - is just as thrilling each time. But this paradoxically rambling and clean-cut novel would have benefited from fewer characters and less striving. For every successful character (such as Frau von Gott, the eccentric German collector and Sterne's mother figure), there is a superfluous one: the Dickensian sewer child, Martha, is a grubby-faced stereotype, a \"please mister\" delinquent whose dealings with the jewel seem little more than a closing device.</p>",

However, while it is accepted in most western cultures that science and religion occupy largely distinct intellectual domains, the situation is much more complicated in the USA, and only with this appreciation is it possible to understand why anyone would bother writing a book like Rocks of Ages . </p> <p>Stephen Jay Gould, an American paleontologist and the closest thing to a polymath that science has produced in the last 30 years, is acutely aware that many of his fellow countryfolk are not in their right minds. His principle problem is with young-earth creationists, a frighteningly well-organised group of pseudo-intellectuals who insist on adhering to a literal interpretation of the Bible. To these people the world really is less than 10,000 years old and really was created by God in six days. </p> <p>Creationism is not entirely an American phenomenon, but it has become a grave problem there because a great many people take it seriously. Indeed, so powerful is the Christian fundamentalist lobby that in 1987 creationists and scientists (including Gould) ended up duking it out in the Supreme Court over the issue of whether evolution and creationism should be taught side by side in schools. Fortunately science won the day, but no one expects the conflict to end there. Truth be told, the spectre of creationism continues to scare the bejesus out of liberal intellectuals right across the USA. </p> <p>So, in large part to head off the creationists at the pass, Gould has penned an extended essay dedicated to the achingly simple argument that science and religion have absolutely no common ground and thus should not be confused with one another. He encapsulates this idea in the phrase Non-Overlapping Magisteria, or NOMA. A magisterium is a domain within which a particular school of teaching has the right tools to engineer meaningful discourse. Magisteria may overlap, but if, as Gould argues, those of science and religion do not, then the investigative and explanatory tools of science will not work anywhere within the magisterium of religion, and vice versa. Thus Gould maintains that religion has nothing meaningful to say about the empirical realm, while science has nothing to say about morality or ultimate meaning. The two magisteria are as chalk and cheese, and those who choose to eat the former or draw with the latter are being either pig-headed or just plain stupid. </p> <p>By exploring a number of historical examples ranging from Galileo's spat with the Catholic church to the flowering of American creationism in the 1980s, Gould shows how violation of the NOMA principle inevitably generates tension between science and religion. Acknowledgment of the immiscibility of magisteria, he says, renders such conflicts meaningless; thus respectful adherence to the principle of NOMA might in the future prevent a lot of ill feeling and save everyone time and trouble. Here Gould is at his brilliant best, illuminating the present with the past, dissecting and reinterpreting historical events and ideas, and effectively cementing the principle of NOMA in the reader's mind by sheer force of example. For those sympathetic to the basic idea (and patient with Gould's convoluted prose), it is a typically convincing performance. </p> <p>But not everyone, I suspect, even in post-fundamentalist Britain, will be sympathetic to the principle of NOMA. Many ordinary Christians (although probably not many theologians) are likely to balk at the idea because it threatens two of their most cherished beliefs, namely that God can perform miracles and answer prayers. If the devout surrender the empirical world entirely to science, this is tantamount to admitting that God imbued the universe with natural law at the beginning of time and has not meddled with it since. But if God can alter the empirical world, either by temporarily suspending natural law (miracles) or intervening in response to prayer, then the magisteria of science and religion do overlap, and tools from both domains are required to understand reality. As science cannot countenance divine intervention, the only way to separate the two magisteria would be for the devout to accept a completely hands-off God, and I suspect that for many this is simply not an option. </p> <p> Rocks of Ages is also likely to annoy some of the author's perennial enemies within science. Few in the profession will fail to notice Gould's implied swipe at those in his own camp who violate the principle of NOMA, in particular a vocal band of scientists - among them some prominent British biologists with whom he has had a running battle for many years - who seem to wear their antitheism as a badge of intellectual honour. These scientific fundamentalists will undoubtedly take extreme pleasure in savaging Gould for his liberal woolly-mindedness, but I suspect the great man is long past caring. Regardless, whether one has an axe to grind or just an interest in science, religion and the hall of mirrors that is American culture, Rocks of Ages is well worth the read.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'Remember, Stalin was a failed writer, Hitler was a failed painter,\" says Andrzej Stasiuk, the latest cult writer to emerge from post-communist Europe. \"The worst people - the root of all evil in the world - are failed artists. You guys were lucky because Winston Churchill was a hell of a good writer.\" </p> <p>Born in the Ukraine, but living in the mountains of South-east Poland (and writing in Polish), 40- year-old Stasiuk has already written nine books in various genres, and his 1993 novel, White Raven , has just been published by Serpent's Tail. It's a story about a group of men, led by a struggling writer, who escape to the mountains to rediscover a purpose to their lives but end up recreating the rebellious days of drinking and whoring under the Russians. Several critics have nominated Stasiuk as the Polish Jack Kerouac, and his rugged good looks, heavy smoking and whisky-drinking certainly fit the bill. </p> <p>But Stasiuk denies that White Raven is a macho survival tale. \"There's just one fight, let's be honest, just one fist-fight,\" he says. \"The book is very balanced. It is shot through with feeling, and it's very feminine in its sensibility. My heroes are not like Hemingway's heroes. His lose, and they are not all that great.\" </p> <p>Instead, the novel is a light allegory of Poland's faltering first steps as a republic, the clash between the restrictions of the past and the dizzying choices of an increased freedom. Yet it's also about the journey from adolescence to maturity. \"Back then,\" says Stasiuk, referring to the early 1980s, \"I was both an irresponsible boy and a grown-up man with responsibilities. And White Raven is also about Poland as an infantile country, and a very grown-up one as well.\" </p> <p>Throughout, the characters experience a muted nostalgia for the days of insurrection. \"The old system fitted very young people with ambition and the will to expand; they had no future and they realised that, so they created a most wonderful present,\" Stasiuk explains. \"But under capitalism there are more rational, more mature beings who weigh the odds and position themselves.\" </p> <p>\"Under communism,\" he continues, \"I did not write one word against the system or for the system. I was writing about myself and my most immediate life. And my belief is that any decent book - maybe not even aimed against the system - is against the system just by being a good book. Besides, we still have enemies.\" </p> <p>What's more, Stasiuk's mountain home gives him a unique perspective on the European situation. \"My wife and I live next to Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the peripheries of these countries - the peripheries of Europe - are very interesting and open-ended. At the borders a lot of stuff seems to fall off the European edifice.\" </p> <p>And it's this detritus that Stasiuk observes. His characters travel the borders, collecting objects and stories, from which they must make the narratives of their lives. Here, Stasiuk's writing is again comparable to the Beats. \"Yes,\" he says, \"for one thing, the on-the-road style is a very convenient literary gimmick; you can walk your protagonist through anything.\" </p> <p>Along with his friend, Marcin Swietlicki, the enfant terrible of Polish poetry, Stasiuk is seen as a spokesman for the post-communist generation. \"It could be the case,\" he says, \"but my generation didn't read books at all, they listened to rock, the simple registers of rock. Iggy Pop, for example. Also, I go to Hungary and Romania to listen to folk-bands, to gypsy music.\" </p> <p>Other influences have to be carefully regulated. \"In the city, I would want the fast life - drinks and drugs and rock'n'roll - so I wouldn't write a single line.

      "bodyText": "'Remember, Stalin was a failed writer, Hitler was a failed painter,\" says Andrzej Stasiuk, the latest cult writer to emerge from post-communist Europe. \"The worst people - the root of all evil in the world - are failed artists. You guys were lucky because Winston Churchill was a hell of a good writer.\" Born in the Ukraine, but living in the mountains of South-east Poland (and writing in Polish), 40- year-old Stasiuk has already written nine books in various genres, and his 1993 novel, White Raven , has just been published by Serpent's Tail. It's a story about a group of men, led by a struggling writer, who escape to the mountains to rediscover a purpose to their lives but end up recreating the rebellious days of drinking and whoring under the Russians. Several critics have nominated Stasiuk as the Polish Jack Kerouac, and his rugged good looks, heavy smoking and whisky-drinking certainly fit the bill. But Stasiuk denies that White Raven is a macho survival tale. \"There's just one fight, let's be honest, just one fist-fight,\" he says. \"The book is very balanced. It is shot through with feeling, and it's very feminine in its sensibility. My heroes are not like Hemingway's heroes. His lose, and they are not all that great.\" Instead, the novel is a light allegory of Poland's faltering first steps as a republic, the clash between the restrictions of the past and the dizzying choices of an increased freedom. Yet it's also about the journey from adolescence to maturity. \"Back then,\" says Stasiuk, referring to the early 1980s, \"I was both an irresponsible boy and a grown-up man with responsibilities. And White Raven is also about Poland as an infantile country, and a very grown-up one as well.\" Throughout, the characters experience a muted nostalgia for the days of insurrection. \"The old system fitted very young people with ambition and the will to expand; they had no future and they realised that, so they created a most wonderful present,\" Stasiuk explains. \"But under capitalism there are more rational, more mature beings who weigh the odds and position themselves.\" \"Under communism,\" he continues, \"I did not write one word against the system or for the system. I was writing about myself and my most immediate life. And my belief is that any decent book - maybe not even aimed against the system - is against the system just by being a good book. Besides, we still have enemies.\" What's more, Stasiuk's mountain home gives him a unique perspective on the European situation. \"My wife and I live next to Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the peripheries of these countries - the peripheries of Europe - are very interesting and open-ended. At the borders a lot of stuff seems to fall off the European edifice.\" And it's this detritus that Stasiuk observes. His characters travel the borders, collecting objects and stories, from which they must make the narratives of their lives. Here, Stasiuk's writing is again comparable to the Beats. \"Yes,\" he says, \"for one thing, the on-the-road style is a very convenient literary gimmick; you can walk your protagonist through anything.\" Along with his friend, Marcin Swietlicki, the enfant terrible of Polish poetry, Stasiuk is seen as a spokesman for the post-communist generation. \"It could be the case,\" he says, \"but my generation didn't read books at all, they listened to rock, the simple registers of rock. Iggy Pop, for example. Also, I go to Hungary and Romania to listen to folk-bands, to gypsy music.\" Other influences have to be carefully regulated. \"In the city, I would want the fast life - drinks and drugs and rock'n'roll - so I wouldn't write a single line. I would die rather quickly. When I'm in the countryside, I drink very little. I don't do drugs at all, and the rock'n'roll is down to a moderate level. I can sleep as long as I want. If I don't feel like shaving, if I want to walk around dirty, then that's precisely what I do. It's this very elemental kind of freedom.\" When he's not writing, he has several other projects to pursue. \"I am building a house, setting up a 40-acre garden, and re-foresting the area.\" Oh, and he breeds llamas, too - all a far cry from the year and a half he spent in prison in the 1980s. \"If you are a decent writer anything can give you the thrust, even a prison sentence.

Art historians and medieval architectural buffs are usually associated more with ivory towers than with war zones; yet such is the embattled nature of Jerusalem that it draws into its controversies even the most detached academics. Palestinian and Israeli archaeologists and historians differ radically in their interpretation of almost every turn in their capital city's past. </p> <p>Israeli historians have traditionally tended to look to the Hebrew Bible to back up the Jewish claim to Jerusalem. They point to the Book of Samuel to show how King David established his capital in the city 1,500 years before an Arab army first appeared below the walls. Palestinians reply that King David's Jerusalem has only the most shadowy basis in the archaeological record, while his empire - one of the principal Zionist claims to great tracts of the Middle East - is more a religious poet's patriotic fantasy, written 1,000 years after the events it describes, than a secu lar historian's solid fact. </p> <p>The arguments are no less bitter for later periods, those 1,900 years of Christian and Islamic Palestinian history which were more or less erased from the collective Israeli memory as the new nation leap-frogged backwards two millennia and looked to the ancient past for its sustenance and inspiration. The symbols of the young Israeli state - the national seal, the medals, even the postage stamps - all drew on symbols from ancient Jewish history. </p> <p>Despite the attempts at rapprochement over the last 10 years, the official Israeli line is still to write off the entire Islamic period as a period of unmitigated decline, with nomad conquerors sweeping in from the desert, massacring or wiping out the indigenous population and leaving the area a semi-depopulated desert until the birth of the Zionist movement in the 19th century. Despite the fact that no serious historian, in Israel or elsewhere, would even begin to try to defend such a crude distortion of Palestine's medieval history, this version still possesses a half-life in Israeli government propaganda. </p> <p>Take, for example, Facts About Israel , the introduction to the country produced by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Here, following an extremely detailed 11-page account of the Biblical Israelite kingdoms, 1,400 years of Islamic history is written off in just one paragraph: \"Arab migration in and out of the country started at the time of the Arab conquest of the Land in the seventh century, fluctuating thereafter with economic growth and decline. Towards the end of the 19th century, when increased Jewish development stimulated economic and social revival in the Land, many Arabs from surrounding countries were attracted to the area by its employment opportunities, higher wages and better living conditions.\" </p> <p>The rest of the historical section of Facts About Israel is given over to a highly dubious account of the creation of the modern state of Israel, which fails to mention what to Palestinians is the central event of the modern history of the region: the Catastrophe of 1948, in which nine-tenths of the indigenous Palestinian population were ethnically cleansed from their ancestral homes in an organised operation codenamed Plan Dalit. Four hundred of the recently deserted Palestinian villages were then systematically bulldozed. In the process Palestinian society was uprooted and destroyed. Israeli embassies across the globe continue to disseminate Facts About Israel in huge quantities. </p> <p>Israeli propagandists have been filling newspapers with different versions of this sort of politically motivated fantasy, which aims to dispossess the Palestinians of their history as fully as they have been dispossessed of their land. Conrad Black-owned papers, such as the Jerusalem Post and the Daily Telegraph , have been particularly susceptible to this sort of nonsense. The Spectator gave over its cover to an article by Daniel Pipes called \"Not so Holy City\", which put forward the thesis that under Muslim rule Jerusalem was always an \"economic laggard and cultural backwater - Muslims have shown interest in Jerusalem only when inspired by pressing concerns, and have lost interest when those concerns lapse. It is then a mistake to equate the city's holiness for the two faiths.\" Pipes echoes the standard Israeli line that under Ottoman rule in particular, \"lack of interest translated into decline and impoverishment\". </p> <p>Thankfully, a book has now been published that is the closest we are ever likely to get to a definitive historical statement on the subject. Ottoman Jerusalem , edited by Professor Robert Hillenbrand and Sylvia Auld, is the result of a major international project, bringing together the work of a team of 33 scholars. Running to two volumes and 1,100 pages, it is a grand historical landmark, and must be the most detailed survey ever published of a Middle Eastern city. </p> <p>The essays on Ottoman Jerusalem include surveys of the political, social and religious history of the period, studies of Ottoman Jerusalem's intellectual and commercial life, its university, libraries, hammams and sufi monasteries, its costumes and songs and music. There is a fascinating pair of essays contrasting Ottoman Jerusalem in Islamic and western travel accounts, and the whole massive project culminates in a detailed architectural survey of every significant Ottoman feature in the entire city, from tiny pieces of decorative tilework and carved and painted ceilings to entire systems of fortification. </p> <p>This degree of detail is particularly welcome, as Ottoman history as a whole is an unusually neglected subject. For 200 years from the mid-15th century, the Ottoman Empire was the most powerful force in all Eurasia: from behind the Sublime Porte, the sultan and his viziers ruled an empire comparable in size and importance to that of Rome, whose last capital it had conquered as its own. The documents in the huge Ottoman state archives - only partially opened to historians 10 years ago and still vigorously censored - are written in a difficult clerical shorthand version of Ottoman Turkish, itself an extinct language with an extinct script that can be read by only a handful of modern scholars. The Turks, taking their lead from Ataturk, deliberately ignore an imperial past they tend to think of as decadent and embarrassing. Few scholars have the necessary language skills to prove them wrong. These difficulties only add to the immense achievement of Ottoman Jerusalem . The result is a revelation. </p> <p>It becomes clear that Jerusalem was never neglected by its Muslim rulers: almost every Ummayad, Mameluk and Ottoman sultan contributed something to the existing fabric of the city. The two most beautiful buildings in Palestine - the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque - were built soon after the Arab conquest, while the overwhelming majority of the buildings the traveller admires today in the streets of the Old City - the bazaars, tombs, colleges, courtyard houses and monumental street fountains as well as the great city gates - were built during the Mameluk and Ottoman periods. This 400-year Ottoman interlude provided, among other monu ments, the great spice bazaars and the city's astonishing white walls, the gift of Suleiman the Magnificent. They remain arguably the most decorative set of Ottoman fortifications in existence, just as the city as a whole remains probably the best preserved Ottoman cityscape to survive from the pre-modern Middle East. </p> <p> Ottoman Jerusalem also nails one particularly pernicious myth: that Jerusalem was never an important cultural or religious centre for Muslims. In Ummayad times the city witnessed an unparalleled flourishing of the arts of which the Dome of the Rock is the most potent symbol. Later, in the Middle Ages, Jerusalem was a key centre of Sufi activity, as well as a renowned centre of book illumination and Islamic jurisprudence. Its streets filled with sufis, artists, scholars, lecturers, jurists and pilgrims from all over the Islamic world. The Ottoman traveller Eviliye Chelebi, who visited Jerusalem in 1648, describes the platform around the Dome choked night and day with pilgrims and dervishes from India, Persia, Central Asia, Kurdistan and Asia Minor. There are similar descriptions from Muslim travellers throughout the Middle Ages. In political and economic terms, Ottoman Jerusalem may not have been a major regional capital, but as one of the three Holy Places of Islam, it is impossible to overestimate its religious significance. </p> <p>William Dalrymple is the author of From the Holy Mountain (Flamingo, \u00a38.99).

      "body": "<p><strong> One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate</strong><br> Tom Segev<br> Little, Brown, \u00a325, 612pp <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502369978,00.htm\" target_new>Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p> When General Allenby entered Jerusalem in December 1917 to claim the Holy Land for the Empire, he inaugurated a 30-year period of political confusion which culminated in the establishment of the state of Israel and the large-scale exodus of one of its national communities. As many as 12,000 British soldiers died in the conquest of Palestine; more were to die in the decades to come. The German residents of Jerusalem were expelled and British officers appropriated their homes. Both sides welcomed the British and were glad to see the backs of the Turks, who had treated them with equal inhumanity. </p> <p>Yet both had played the game under Ottoman rule. The imams of the Al Aqsa mosque had called for a jihad or holy war in Turkey's name, while the Jews of Tel Aviv had celebrated Lord Kitchener's loss at sea. A few weeks earlier, the British government had issued the Balfour Declaration, which had promised \"a national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine. This was, in part, due to the diplomatic contacts that CP Snow, the editor of the Manchester Guardian , had facilitated for Chaim Weizmann, later the first President of Israel. </p> <p>Tom Segev's extremely interesting book tells the story of the British mandate, emphasising both British benevolence and the fundamental irreconcilability of the two national movements, Jewish and Palestinian. It is indeed more story-telling than popular history, since the strength of his soothsaying lies in seeing this tale of passionate devotion to the land and the violent means to win it through the eyes of symbolic participants. Diaries, memoirs and letters back to Blighty have been mustered to create this landscape. It is a kind of literary theatre rather than history, and Segev moves his actors on and off stage with great skill. </p> <p>Many political figures in this drama, such as Lloyd George, based their support for Zionism on Victorian education and Christian dispensationalist understanding of the Jewish return - as well as a determination to keep the French out of Palestine. Indeed, the Governor of Jerusalem, Ronald Storrs, uses the Hebrew word \"shechina\" - divine presence - in his memoirs. Yet some also believed that the Jews were a mystical all-powerful group which manipulated both capitalism and communism, and with whom an alliance could and should be struck. Shortly after Louis John Bol's arrival as an administrative official in 1919, he described the Zionist Commission as \"a tyrannical and Bolshevik organisation\". Several years later, General Sir Evelyn Barker, head of the British forces in Palestine after Hitler's war, wrote to his mistress, \"Just think of all this life and money being wasted for these bloody Jews. Yes I loathe the lot - whether they be Zionists or not.\" </p> <p>Yet many were indifferent, or professed to seek a way to satisfy the legitimate claims of both Jews and Arabs. \"I am not for either, but for both,\" Storrs wrote. \"Two hours of Arab grievances drive me into the synagogue while after an intense course of Zionist propaganda I am prepared to embrace Islam.\" It was perhaps more a question of getting the job done. The British left Israel in much better shape than they had found Ottoman Palestine; yet they had not instituted compulsory school attendance, and only three out of every 10 Arabs went to school. The imperial legacy to the rest was a romanticised illiteracy. This manifested a lack of national cohesion for which the Palestinian cause paid so dearly in 1948. </p> <p>Segev's use of diaries portrays the human qualities of all sides, the individual friendships of Arab and Jew who nonetheless professed unremitting belief in the justice of their causes.

      "bodyText": "One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate Tom Segev Little, Brown, \u00a325, 612pp Buy it at a discount at BOL When General Allenby entered Jerusalem in December 1917 to claim the Holy Land for the Empire, he inaugurated a 30-year period of political confusion which culminated in the establishment of the state of Israel and the large-scale exodus of one of its national communities. As many as 12,000 British soldiers died in the conquest of Palestine; more were to die in the decades to come. The German residents of Jerusalem were expelled and British officers appropriated their homes. Both sides welcomed the British and were glad to see the backs of the Turks, who had treated them with equal inhumanity. Yet both had played the game under Ottoman rule. The imams of the Al Aqsa mosque had called for a jihad or holy war in Turkey's name, while the Jews of Tel Aviv had celebrated Lord Kitchener's loss at sea. A few weeks earlier, the British government had issued the Balfour Declaration, which had promised \"a national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine. This was, in part, due to the diplomatic contacts that CP Snow, the editor of the Manchester Guardian , had facilitated for Chaim Weizmann, later the first President of Israel. Tom Segev's extremely interesting book tells the story of the British mandate, emphasising both British benevolence and the fundamental irreconcilability of the two national movements, Jewish and Palestinian. It is indeed more story-telling than popular history, since the strength of his soothsaying lies in seeing this tale of passionate devotion to the land and the violent means to win it through the eyes of symbolic participants. Diaries, memoirs and letters back to Blighty have been mustered to create this landscape. It is a kind of literary theatre rather than history, and Segev moves his actors on and off stage with great skill. Many political figures in this drama, such as Lloyd George, based their support for Zionism on Victorian education and Christian dispensationalist understanding of the Jewish return - as well as a determination to keep the French out of Palestine. Indeed, the Governor of Jerusalem, Ronald Storrs, uses the Hebrew word \"shechina\" - divine presence - in his memoirs. Yet some also believed that the Jews were a mystical all-powerful group which manipulated both capitalism and communism, and with whom an alliance could and should be struck. Shortly after Louis John Bol's arrival as an administrative official in 1919, he described the Zionist Commission as \"a tyrannical and Bolshevik organisation\". Several years later, General Sir Evelyn Barker, head of the British forces in Palestine after Hitler's war, wrote to his mistress, \"Just think of all this life and money being wasted for these bloody Jews. Yes I loathe the lot - whether they be Zionists or not.\" Yet many were indifferent, or professed to seek a way to satisfy the legitimate claims of both Jews and Arabs. \"I am not for either, but for both,\" Storrs wrote. \"Two hours of Arab grievances drive me into the synagogue while after an intense course of Zionist propaganda I am prepared to embrace Islam.\" It was perhaps more a question of getting the job done. The British left Israel in much better shape than they had found Ottoman Palestine; yet they had not instituted compulsory school attendance, and only three out of every 10 Arabs went to school. The imperial legacy to the rest was a romanticised illiteracy. This manifested a lack of national cohesion for which the Palestinian cause paid so dearly in 1948. Segev's use of diaries portrays the human qualities of all sides, the individual friendships of Arab and Jew who nonetheless professed unremitting belief in the justice of their causes. It is about idealism, but it is also about ordinary - and sometimes extraordinary - people expressing ordinary concerns. Segev has utilised Israeli archive material to document further black spots in Zionist history. The reputation of Orde Wingate, the British commander of the Jewish \"special night squads\", receives a battering after revelations of the killings at the village of Hitin. Unfortunately there are no sources from Arab archives; Segev relies on the Hebrew translation of Khalil al-Sakakini's memoirs and English-language recollections to allow the Palestinian members of the cast to say their piece. The writer Michael Andre Bernstein defined \"backshadowing\" as a \"retroactive foreshadowing in which the shared knowledge of the outcome of a series of events by a narrator is used to judge the participants in those events - as though they too should have known what was to come.\" Segev views the mandate through post-Zionist spectacles for an Israeli audience examining their history. Such selectivity adds to our knowledge of the period, but the full history remains to be stripped of its secrets - at least on the Arab side. That history in all its complexity would perhaps not make such exciting reading, but Segev's use of eccentric anecdotes, bizarre facts and fascinating vignettes certainly achieves that end.

He closed the evening with the seven Rellstab settings from Schwanengesang, done so immaculately that you wanted the cycle in its entirety. The famous Serenade was full of seditious urgency. In Der Ferne encapsulated extremes of emotional exhaustion. The final Abschied (Farewell) combined wit with a tender nostalgia. That Henschel and Banse have yet to achieve star status is perhaps surprising. The evening revealed both of them to be great artists, ranking among the finest Lieder singers of our times.",

Argos is not alone. Most major department stores and retail chains promote an in-house card charging rates way in excess of those available on bank credit cards. </p> <p>Jaeger's is 29.8%, Country Casuals charges 30.7%, all Creation cards, which can be used in shops such as Liberty, Millets and Selfridges, have a rate of 30.9%, while The Timecard, which can be used at Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths, Superdrug and Next, charges customers who fail to pay off their total balance each month a massive 31.9%. </p> <p>This is at a time when credit is coming down in price. All the major credit card providers have been forced to bring down their rates by competition from new entrants to the market, but store cards continue to charge more than double credit cards. Buy your \u00a3100 dress on your Egg card, for instance, and you would be subject to a rate of just 11.9%, following an introductory offer period of six months' free credit. </p> <p>In-store credit is not only expensive, it is also very readily available, even pushed. In one morning of shopping I was offered \u00a36,000 to spend in various shops. Sometimes I had to ask for it, but in other stores the offer was made without my initiating the conversation. In shops selling clothes aimed at the teenage market, advertisements scream: \"It couldn't be easier to apply - do it now! \" and: \"Up to \u00a3500 to spend instantly.\" </p> <p>And in the week when the government is slapping down banks and other credit card providers for not making their interest rates prominent, I found that the annual percentage rate (APR) did not appear in the majority of store card leaflets. When questioned on the mechanics of the cards which their stores were selling in the same way as any other merchandise, the assistant often did not understand the most basic details of the card and, at other times, their information was either misleading or wrong. In Ted Baker, when asked about the annual percentage rate, I was given the monthly interest rate. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Arcardia, the group whose portfolio includes Warehouse and Miss Selfridge, insists: \"All our staff are trained within two weeks of starting. They should know what the rates are and help the customer fill out the form.\" So, why do people continue to take out these cards? Why would you want to sign up for a card which can be used in a limited set of stores, with way above average interest rates for credit and which allows a shop to consider you as part of its \"family\" - giving it access to raid your details on its database for marketing needs? </p> <p>For some people, this sense of belonging is, in fact, what persuades them to take a card in the first place, and in some cases, the emotional worth of card membership is echoed by its financial worth. For others, it is the range of special deals to which card membership gives access, although these are generally \"feelgood\" offers, such as invitations to exclusive shopping evenings, which are of low commercial value.</p> <p>Lorraine Brannan, head of marketing at Marks &amp; Spencer, which now accepts bank credit cards, admits that she is puzzled, adding that applications for the M&amp;S card have been at the steady rate of around 4,000 a month for at least two years. </p> <p>\"The company is currently conducting research into quite why so many people do opt for the card,\" she says. Steve Worthington, professor of marketing of financial services at Staffordshire University, suggests that customers opt for these cards because they like to have a line of credit which is unknown to their bank. </p> <p>Yet shops can afford to offer credit lines for less and one or two do John Lewis's card has a standard rate of just 13%, aping the main credit card providers. It goes to show that the 25%-30% rates charged by are store groups are little more than a rip-off. </p> <p>M&amp;S has cut its card rate to 18.9% (Barclaycard, the number one provider of credit cards, charges 19.4%). Ms Brannan says: \"We took a decision to ensure that our card is in line with other means of payment ... that option is open to other retailers: it is a commercial decision that they take.\" </p> <p>Professor Worthington adds that one reason why store cards are so expensive relative to credit cards is that the card administrators do not have the same range of alternative income streams available to them: \"These finance companies do not have the benefit of the annual fee which is charged on some credit cards, nor do they have the merchant service charge (1%). Having said this, however, the charges are still very high.\" </p> <p>The Arcadia spokeswoman says: \"We have a long-standing relationship with our partner who provides the card.

      "body": "<p>In every high street retailers are urging consumers to \"buy one and get one free\" or snap up a once in a lifetime half-price purchase as the new year sales stumble into February. Housebuilders are now playing the same game. In many areas of the country the market is quiet and, in a bid to sell homes, builders are offering part-exchange, legal fees paid, even free fitted carpets. </p> <p>As trading standards officers will confirm, offers that appear too good to be true usually are, and experts warn buyers against signing up to the deals without taking independent advice. According to Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers Charcol, builders include a margin in the asking price to cover the costs of buyer incentives. </p> <p>One of the most popular incentives on offer is part-exchange, a gimmick that housebuilder Barratt claims to have pioneered in 1971. Since then about 75,000 homebuyers have taken advantage of it, says Barratt group chairman Frank Eaton.</p> <p>After buyers have reserved their new home under a part-exchange offer, Barratt will arrange for their present property to be valued by an independent chartered surveyor or valuer. The company then makes the seller an offer on the property (subject to contract and any surveys) within seven days. The sale progresses as normal and the customer remains in their current home until the new one is ready.</p> <p>In order to qualify, movers need to move upmarket and buy a home that is worth at least 30% more than the value of their current home. According to Barratt, the schemes save movers the hassle of selling their home, estate agent's fees, the possibility of getting stuck in a chain and last-minute price haggling. </p> <p>Barratt is advertising part-exchange deals at Westfield Place, a development of houses and apartments in Feltham, west London. Fairclough Homes' part-exchange deals at Hartham Place in Hertford stipulate the new home must cost 30% more than buyers' current home and come from the Hertfordshire area. Here, small four-bedroom homes are on offer for \u00a3280,000. </p> <p>Part-exchange offers usually only apply to specific properties on a development, often to the less appealing plots that the developer may have difficulty shifting. The most obvious benefit of part-exchange is that sellers don't have to worry about finding a buyer for their home or about getting stuck in a chain, says Mr Boulger. </p> <p>But he advises movers thinking of taking this route to ensure they get a reasonable price from the builder for the property they're selling. Usually, developers will get a couple of estate agents or surveyors to value the property and take a price in the middle of the two valuations. The developer will offer the seller anything between 93-100% of the value of the property, says Mr Boulger. </p> <p>Prudent sellers will check how much their home is worth with estate agents before they enter into a part-exchange contract. However, those selling an unusual property should proceed with caution. </p> <p>On some developments Barratt offers a free agency selling service. This means buyers can reserve a Barratt home \"off plan\" or at an early stage of construction. Buyers secure their new home at a fixed price while Barratt sells their existing home following a valuation and after agreeing a \"realistic\" asking price with the owner. </p> <p> Barratt says it then markets the property professionally - \"using marketing skills and selective sales incentives to find a buyer\". In the heady days of the 1980s the absence of savings to put down as a deposit on a house failed to prevent many first time buyers from securing their first home. </p> <p>Housebuilders are targeting the same group of aspiring homeowners by offering to pay a 5% deposit to allow them to buy a new home. Fairview New Homes is offering to pay deposits on properties in Cricklewood, North Woolwich, Enfield and Greenwich. Wimpey Homes will pay a 5% deposit on selected homes at developments in Chessington, Hillingdon and Hounslow. Fairclough Homes North West is offering first-time buyer properties in Oswaldwhistle under similar schemes. </p> <p>In theory the offers are very attractive. However, buyers may have problems when it comes to applying for a mortgage. If a property costs \u00a3100,000 and the builder says it will pay 5%, the buyer will apply for a \u00a395,000 mortgage, says Mr Boulger. But what if the lenders' valuer says the property is only worth \u00a395,000 because that is the final cost. Then the buyer will have to come up with 5% of the \u00a395,000 as a deposit. The only way forward will be to get a 100% mortgage, generally with a higher interest rate. </p> <p>Some builders will get particular lenders to agree to accept the 5% reduction as a deposit rather than as a reduction in purchase price. This means \"on completion the builder gets 95% of the theoretical purchase price from the lender and the remaining 5% is written off\", he says. </p> <p>Mr Boulger urges buyers to haggle. \"The sales consultant will have some leeway in terms of negotiating. Maybe 5%, maybe less. Whatever price the builders are quoting is a guide price.\" </p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.faircloughhomes.com\">Fairclough Homes</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.barratthomes.co.uk\">Barratt Homes</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wimpeyhomes.co.uk\">Wimpey Homes</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fairview.co.uk\">Fairview Homes</a></p>",

Part-exchange offers usually only apply to specific properties on a development, often to the less appealing plots that the developer may have difficulty shifting. The most obvious benefit of part-exchange is that sellers don't have to worry about finding a buyer for their home or about getting stuck in a chain, says Mr Boulger. But he advises movers thinking of taking this route to ensure they get a reasonable price from the builder for the property they're selling. Usually, developers will get a couple of estate agents or surveyors to value the property and take a price in the middle of the two valuations. The developer will offer the seller anything between 93-100% of the value of the property, says Mr Boulger. Prudent sellers will check how much their home is worth with estate agents before they enter into a part-exchange contract. However, those selling an unusual property should proceed with caution. On some developments Barratt offers a free agency selling service. This means buyers can reserve a Barratt home \"off plan\" or at an early stage of construction. Buyers secure their new home at a fixed price while Barratt sells their existing home following a valuation and after agreeing a \"realistic\" asking price with the owner. Barratt says it then markets the property professionally - \"using marketing skills and selective sales incentives to find a buyer\". In the heady days of the 1980s the absence of savings to put down as a deposit on a house failed to prevent many first time buyers from securing their first home. Housebuilders are targeting the same group of aspiring homeowners by offering to pay a 5% deposit to allow them to buy a new home. Fairview New Homes is offering to pay deposits on properties in Cricklewood, North Woolwich, Enfield and Greenwich. Wimpey Homes will pay a 5% deposit on selected homes at developments in Chessington, Hillingdon and Hounslow. Fairclough Homes North West is offering first-time buyer properties in Oswaldwhistle under similar schemes. In theory the offers are very attractive. However, buyers may have problems when it comes to applying for a mortgage. If a property costs \u00a3100,000 and the builder says it will pay 5%, the buyer will apply for a \u00a395,000 mortgage, says Mr Boulger. But what if the lenders' valuer says the property is only worth \u00a395,000 because that is the final cost. Then the buyer will have to come up with 5% of the \u00a395,000 as a deposit. The only way forward will be to get a 100% mortgage, generally with a higher interest rate. Some builders will get particular lenders to agree to accept the 5% reduction as a deposit rather than as a reduction in purchase price. This means \"on completion the builder gets 95% of the theoretical purchase price from the lender and the remaining 5% is written off\", he says. Mr Boulger urges buyers to haggle. \"The sales consultant will have some leeway in terms of negotiating. Maybe 5%, maybe less. Whatever price the builders are quoting is a guide price.\" Useful links Fairclough Homes Barratt Homes Wimpey Homes Fairview Homes",

What prompted the most interest was the revelation that the Treasury is considering capping the interest rates people pay by insisting they are set at no more than a certain amount above the Bank of England base rate (currently 6%). But this idea is likely to face opposition from some of the industry's big players who will say the government shouldn't be meddling in the setting of rates. </p> <p>However, where the government seems less likely to back down is on its proposal that, in order to win the CAT-mark of quality, a card would not be able to charge an annual fee. </p> <p>One of the players which will come under pressure to shape up is Barclaycard, the UK's largest credit card issuer with 7.8m cardholders, whose annual percentage rate (APR) is 19.4% - more than three times the base rate - and which is one of the few providers which still impose an annual fee. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the proposed rules are voluntary, so card issuers won't have to comply - but ministers will be hoping that a large proportion of the UK's issuers will adopt them, and there will clearly be pressure on firms to do this or risk losing customers to rivals. </p> <p>Strictly speaking, the new rules don't apply to store cards, many of which are notorious for extremely high rates - typically around 29-30% APR. But some of the more responsible store card providers might decide to adopt them. Marks &amp; Spencer, the UK's largest store card issuer with 6.1m cards and one of the lowest APRs (18.9%), said it would be studying the new rules \"to see whether there are things we should be looking at\". </p> <p>Ministers say the new standards - which are likely to be in force by the end of the year - will help people to shop around for the best deal and ensure they are not hit by hidden charges. It spells good news for the UK's 25m credit card holders who between them have \u00a324bn of outstanding debt attracting interest. </p> <p>The Treasury says it has not yet made up its mind about whether it will insist interest rates are linked to the bank base rate. They could decide that a card's interest rate must be within X percentage points of the base rate (it hasn't yet said what the \"X\" might be). </p> <p>Alternatively, it could insist that the interest rate must track any downward movement in the base rate within, say, 28 days, so people are not left stranded on high rates when interest rates are dropping. The other main requirements of the new regime are: </p> <p>\u0095 All credit card statements must clearly state the annual percentage rate (APR); from what date interest is charged (some card issuers charge interest from the date the item is charged to the account, others charge from the date the goods are bought) and all other charges. </p> <p>\u0095 No annual fee (aside from Barclaycard, those who still charge customers a fee include Abbey National, Clydesdale Bank) and Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>\u0095 No minimum spending limit. </p> <p>\u0095 All information to be expressed in language that is fair, clear and not misleading. </p> <p>\u0095 Any late payment penalty must be no higher than \u00a320 and the fee for exceeding your credit limit can be no more than \u00a35 (these two figures are provisional). </p> <p> The second of these two could really sort the men from the boys, as many providers currently charge a fee for going over your credit limit well in excess of \u00a35. In the case of NatWest, Lloyds TSB and RBS Advanta the fee is currently \u00a315, while Egg charges a whopping \u00a320 </p> <p>\u0095 For cash withdrawals, the fee must be no more than 1.5% (among those charging more than this are Tesco Personal Finance and Smile). </p> <p>Broadly speaking, credit cards tend to fall into two different camps. There are those such as Barclaycard, which don't offer particularly competitive interest rates but don't impose any of the nasty small-print fees. Then there are others such as Egg's card, which offers a great rate but has lots of fees lurking around. </p> <p>You should choose a card based on how you use plastic. If you pay off your credit card bill in full each month, thereby avoiding interest charges, the interest rate is pretty irrelevant. So look at the perks on offer. Cashback and air miles are both popular - the Alliance &amp; Leicester MoneyBack card is one of several that gives you cash back depending on how much you spend. </p> <p>If you don't usually pay off your balance at the end of each month your priority should be a low interest rate. Egg and Capital One Bank are both offering cards with zero per cent introductory APRs for the first six months - after that the rate rises to a not-bad 11.9% and 12.9% respectively. </p> <p>Egg's card offers the added plus of a cashback scheme. RBS Advanta's card has an introductory APR of 1.9 that lasts longer - until January 1 next year - but after that date the rate jumps to 17.9%.</p>",

Ministers say the new standards - which are likely to be in force by the end of the year - will help people to shop around for the best deal and ensure they are not hit by hidden charges. It spells good news for the UK's 25m credit card holders who between them have \u00a324bn of outstanding debt attracting interest. The Treasury says it has not yet made up its mind about whether it will insist interest rates are linked to the bank base rate. They could decide that a card's interest rate must be within X percentage points of the base rate (it hasn't yet said what the \"X\" might be). Alternatively, it could insist that the interest rate must track any downward movement in the base rate within, say, 28 days, so people are not left stranded on high rates when interest rates are dropping. The other main requirements of the new regime are: \u0095 All credit card statements must clearly state the annual percentage rate (APR); from what date interest is charged (some card issuers charge interest from the date the item is charged to the account, others charge from the date the goods are bought) and all other charges. \u0095 No annual fee (aside from Barclaycard, those who still charge customers a fee include Abbey National, Clydesdale Bank) and Royal Bank of Scotland. \u0095 No minimum spending limit. \u0095 All information to be expressed in language that is fair, clear and not misleading. \u0095 Any late payment penalty must be no higher than \u00a320 and the fee for exceeding your credit limit can be no more than \u00a35 (these two figures are provisional). The second of these two could really sort the men from the boys, as many providers currently charge a fee for going over your credit limit well in excess of \u00a35. In the case of NatWest, Lloyds TSB and RBS Advanta the fee is currently \u00a315, while Egg charges a whopping \u00a320 \u0095 For cash withdrawals, the fee must be no more than 1.5% (among those charging more than this are Tesco Personal Finance and Smile). Broadly speaking, credit cards tend to fall into two different camps. There are those such as Barclaycard, which don't offer particularly competitive interest rates but don't impose any of the nasty small-print fees. Then there are others such as Egg's card, which offers a great rate but has lots of fees lurking around. You should choose a card based on how you use plastic. If you pay off your credit card bill in full each month, thereby avoiding interest charges, the interest rate is pretty irrelevant. So look at the perks on offer. Cashback and air miles are both popular - the Alliance &amp; Leicester MoneyBack card is one of several that gives you cash back depending on how much you spend. If you don't usually pay off your balance at the end of each month your priority should be a low interest rate. Egg and Capital One Bank are both offering cards with zero per cent introductory APRs for the first six months - after that the rate rises to a not-bad 11.9% and 12.9% respectively. Egg's card offers the added plus of a cashback scheme. RBS Advanta's card has an introductory APR of 1.9 that lasts longer - until January 1 next year - but after that date the rate jumps to 17.9%.",
