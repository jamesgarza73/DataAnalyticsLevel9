The one thing we do not need now in an divisive internal debate.\" Donnachadh McCarthy, a critic of co-operation with Labour, claimed direct election for key party bodies would end political accountability in the party.",

      "byline": "Sally Weale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You've got a good job, you're doing well, you're climbing the career ladder as fast as you can. But have you ever stopped to think what will happen when you reach the top rung? Is it possible to be too successful, too young? </p> <p>The prime minister touches on this very issue this week in an interview in the Blairs' favourite women's magazine, Prima. In an illuminating aside, he pauses to consider what life will hold for him once he leaves office. \"I don't know whether I believe in a mid-life crisis,\" Blair says enigmatically. \"But there is a point where you think back and wonder, what were the ambitions I started with, what am I going to do for the rest of my life and what will I do when I have fulfilled my ambitions.\" </p> <p>He still has a lot he wants to achieve as prime minister, he says - but it's what he will do afterwards that is more troubling. Having done the most important job in the country, having fulfilled his greatest ambitions, what can possibly lie ahead? What happens when you've done it all - and you're still not even 50? It is a predicament that reflects a growing trend in society. People are achieving their goals, realising their ambitions and making their fortunes at a younger age than ever before. </p> <p>Traditionally, in business and in politics, it might take decades to work one's way to the top; even the most talented had to \"do their time\", fortunes were accrued slowly but surely and highfliers often did not peak until their late 50s. Today, you can be prime minister at 44, a chief executive in your 30s and an e-millionaire before you've left home. </p> <p>American internet tycoon Mark Cuban was just 41 when he sold his company for $6b. He had always known he would be wealthy - he worked hard to make his company, broadcast.com, a success. After selling up to Yahoo, he celebrated in Las Vegas and the Bahamas, then came home to face the rest of his life. His ambition had always been to make a fortune - having made it so early in life, what came next? \"His plan to get rich had never included a plan to be rich,\" as one American journalist pointed out. </p> <p>But Cuban, it seems, is coping very well with the problem of being young and rich. First he bought himself all the usual billionaire's trappings - a $13m Dallas chateau, a $40m jet. Then he realised another lifelong ambition and bought a basketball team, for $280m. The Dallas Mavericks are one of the worst teams in the league, making Cuban's next challenge to turn around their fortunes and start making more money. </p> <p>For people like Cuban and Blair, the drive and ambition that have brought them such extraordinary success so early in life is simply redirected into something else. \"This phenomenon is more prevalent than ever before,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology at Manchester University. \"People are getting to senior positions much younger. Twenty years ago, a chief executive of a company would have been about 55. Now they are between 35 and 40, and they are looking around and saying: 'Now what am I going to do?' I don't call it a mid-life crisis, I call it a mid-career crisis.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Cooper believes such people will find something to do. \"They all do. Quite a lot of senior executives in industry go through a period of uncertainty after they've become an entrepreneur, built up a company - you've done that, you've been there, what do you do now? What these people should say to themselves is: 'I've achieved everything I wanted to achieve, what use can I make of the experience I have?' It frees you up to achieve something you really care about, something you almost certainly could not achieve when you were in office.\" </p> <p>This was certainly the case for Jimmy Carter. Chased out of the White House at the age of 56 after a disastrous term as US president, he went on to become a freelance global diplomat of enormous influence. \"I'm one of the youngest survivors of the White House,\" he said, \"and I've been able to utilise the experience and knowledge and prestige and access to leaders, and to complete some of the things I was not able to complete in the White House.\" </p> <p>More often, deposed politicians set up their foundations, write their memoirs, then sit on the sidelines reminiscing about their time in office. For loss of power is not the only blow to the highly successful: loss of visibility also hurts. </p> <p>\"In a role like prime minister or chief executive of a company, you are in the public eye all the time,\" Cooper points out. \"It may have a cost in terms of your private life, it may constrain a whole range of activities you'd like to do but can't - but lots of people miss that visibility. Being in the public eye makes you feel important and when you leave office, you don't have the reinforcement of your role by the media.\" As Carter said of leaving the White House and returning to his failing peanut farm in his home town: \"Nobody was begging for my presence.\" </p> <p>So what do those thrusting entrepreneurs who have set up thriving businesses and made millions in their 20s dream about for the future? Are they worried that they're doing it all too young and there will be little left to strive for? </p> <p>Jason Drummond certainly isn't losing any sleep over it. Just 30, he is the founder of Virtual Internet and is worth an estimated \u00a340m. \"There's no doubt the world of work has changed,\" he says. \"You know how you used to have to do your time, no matter how good you were? That's certainly all gone. What will come out at the other end, I've no idea. Probably people will aspire to different things, not only in business but in other aspects of their life, too. I've got two young children and they are probably the thing I'm most proud of.\" </p> <p>As for his own future, Drummond says: \"Since I was 16, my ambition was to build a successful business. We are now a fully listed, fully quoted PLC and that's quite a good achievement. But there are always new challenges. Now I'm excited about going up from a medium-sized to a large business.\" Then what? \"Even larger.\" </p> <p>Entrepreneurs like Drummond will always find alternative goals. They don't just set up one business and make it successful, they do it again and again. Others develop a philanthropic impulse - 51-year-old computer millionaire Peter Ogden last year donated \u00a325m to fund talented children from modest backgrounds to attend top fee-paying schools. </p> <p>\"Human beings are very resilient,\" Cooper concludes. \"Yes, there are people who never recover, who never come to terms with losing their influence and their visibility. But the majority ultimately find another niche, another role.\"</p>",

He described the company's reported talks with several takeover targets including Campbell's Soup of the US as \"smoke and mirrors\". Unilever said it would employ an \"all-star team approach\" to selecting which managers should stay with the combined group. Niall Fitzgerald, Unilever co-chairman, predicted savings of \u00a3750m before 2003. \"We were quite determined to be patient and deliberate about it as we wanted Bestfood's management to come in willingly.\"",

Bits of black lace, phallic elephant's tusk, shower curtain and saucy snapshots tell us this is a self-exposing male sexual confession. Desire is a will-o'-the-wisp and so is the content of this installation. The best bit is only visible through a glass window as you look down the length of Clark's wooden structure to see the spine of iron columns concealed by his painted rooms. The spookiness of this sealed space drew attention to the fussiness of the rooms. As he seems to be aware, this artist is a bit of a ham. Until June 17.

      "body": "<p>The organisers of Euro 2000 admitted yesterday that their supposedly watertight security policy of allowing into grounds only fans who are carrying tickets bearing their names is already showing worrying signs of leakage. </p> <p>And, with thousands of fans set to converge on Belgium and the Netherlands this week, the ambitious plan appears to be impossible to implement given the congestion expected in and around stadiums. </p> <p>\"Perhaps our threat to turn away fans who are carrying tickets which do not bear their names has not been properly thought out,\" said the Euro 2000 spokesman Michel van Schie. \"We will not have the resources to implement this policy. There is no way that we will be able to check every fan that is going into a ground.\" </p> <p>Euro 2000 organisers, like their predecessors at France '98, had hoped that the names-on-tickets policy might deter supporters from buying them on the black market. But, as in France, those who have bought a ticket through a third party, assuming they behave reasonably, are unlikely to have a problem gaining admission to a ground. </p> <p>All tickets for Euro 2000 will carry a name. Those that are purchased through national football associations will bear the name of the relevant organisation, while those that have been purchased independently will carry the name of the person who bought them. </p> <p>Tournament organisers concede that their sales policy was designed to ensure that all tickets are traceable to somebody.

      "bodyText": "The organisers of Euro 2000 admitted yesterday that their supposedly watertight security policy of allowing into grounds only fans who are carrying tickets bearing their names is already showing worrying signs of leakage. And, with thousands of fans set to converge on Belgium and the Netherlands this week, the ambitious plan appears to be impossible to implement given the congestion expected in and around stadiums. \"Perhaps our threat to turn away fans who are carrying tickets which do not bear their names has not been properly thought out,\" said the Euro 2000 spokesman Michel van Schie. \"We will not have the resources to implement this policy. There is no way that we will be able to check every fan that is going into a ground.\" Euro 2000 organisers, like their predecessors at France '98, had hoped that the names-on-tickets policy might deter supporters from buying them on the black market. But, as in France, those who have bought a ticket through a third party, assuming they behave reasonably, are unlikely to have a problem gaining admission to a ground. All tickets for Euro 2000 will carry a name. Those that are purchased through national football associations will bear the name of the relevant organisation, while those that have been purchased independently will carry the name of the person who bought them. Tournament organisers concede that their sales policy was designed to ensure that all tickets are traceable to somebody. All national football associations have had to provide a list of fans who have purchased tickets from them while a large number of tickets, almost 30% of the total allocation of 1.2m, have been sold over the internet. Fans buying tickets over the counter in Holland and Belgium have had to produce proof of identification and declare their address. \"We know the names of everybody who has bought tickets and our sales policy is connected to the security of stadiums,\" said Van Schie. \"One way or another, we will be able to trace who has bought tickets.\" But, while all tickets have been sold directly by Euro 2000, the tournament's organising body, officials admit that there is little they can do if a fan in England sells on a ticket to another supporter who is then arrested for causing trouble at a match. \"Technically the person whose name is on the ticket is responsible for that ticket,\" he added. \"They can be held accountable if it finds its way into somebody else's hands.

I say modern because I suspect the notion of the eccentric between the posts is of recent provenance. Certainly there were goalkeepers in the distant past who were wild and wacky but surely not so many as there are today. </p> <p>A few years ago football was branded \"the new rock 'n' roll\". Later in some eyes comedy became \"the new rock 'n' roll\", presumably leaving football as the new skiffle. I do not hold with this development. To my mind football is still the new rock 'n' roll and goalkeepers are the drummers. They are men who have to behave in an outlandish manner in order to draw attention to themselves - because, just as no one fancies the drummer, likewise it is a sad child indeed who dons a replica goalkeeper's jersey. </p> <p>Over the past couple of decades this notion of the crazy goalkeeper has been re-inforced by the endless propaganda put out by Bob Wilson. Though many of the ITV frontman's contemporaries, Pat Jennings and Ray Clemence for instance, were such slaves to dull rationality that they make Delia Smith look like Don King, the Arsenal old boy rarely misses an opportunity to remind us of the sheer lunacy of the netminding fraternity. </p> <p>Possibly this is because Bob himself was very much the Keith Moon of his profession. The Who drummer infamously drove his Rolls Royce into an LA swimming pool. </p> <p>The Arsenal goalkeeper, meanwhile, is reported to have once steered his Rover 2000 in through the out gate of a car park in Hatfield. Like many of the wilder celebrity stories, though, this may be apocryphal. </p> <p>Ever since Wilson began his campaign more and more mad goalkeepers have appeared - mad, I should say, in a footballing sense. Jorge Campos wears flamboyant outfits but he does not sit at the back of the team coach rambling about space monkeys. Ed de Goey may look like the eponymous anti-hero of some straight-to-video stalk-and-slash movie but he does not march around the West End wearing a sandwich board predicting armageddon unless we all stop eating peanuts this minute. </p> <p>Some types of weirdness would probably not be encouraged even by Bob Wilson. But Sweden's defence in the 1994 World Cup was doubtless strengthened by the presence of wild-eyed Tomas Ravelli. It would surely increase the concentration of any centre-half to know the man standing behind him looked as if he would have been happier chasing Shelley Duvall around the Overlook Hotel with an axe than picking the ball out of the net. </p> <p>Wilson's tireless campaign has had an impact on football thinking. Nowadays one suspects that, just as coaches look for pace in strikers, they are also actively seeking delirium in potential keepers.</p>",

Certainly there were goalkeepers in the distant past who were wild and wacky but surely not so many as there are today. A few years ago football was branded \"the new rock 'n' roll\". Later in some eyes comedy became \"the new rock 'n' roll\", presumably leaving football as the new skiffle. I do not hold with this development. To my mind football is still the new rock 'n' roll and goalkeepers are the drummers. They are men who have to behave in an outlandish manner in order to draw attention to themselves - because, just as no one fancies the drummer, likewise it is a sad child indeed who dons a replica goalkeeper's jersey. Over the past couple of decades this notion of the crazy goalkeeper has been re-inforced by the endless propaganda put out by Bob Wilson. Though many of the ITV frontman's contemporaries, Pat Jennings and Ray Clemence for instance, were such slaves to dull rationality that they make Delia Smith look like Don King, the Arsenal old boy rarely misses an opportunity to remind us of the sheer lunacy of the netminding fraternity. Possibly this is because Bob himself was very much the Keith Moon of his profession. The Who drummer infamously drove his Rolls Royce into an LA swimming pool. The Arsenal goalkeeper, meanwhile, is reported to have once steered his Rover 2000 in through the out gate of a car park in Hatfield. Like many of the wilder celebrity stories, though, this may be apocryphal. Ever since Wilson began his campaign more and more mad goalkeepers have appeared - mad, I should say, in a footballing sense. Jorge Campos wears flamboyant outfits but he does not sit at the back of the team coach rambling about space monkeys. Ed de Goey may look like the eponymous anti-hero of some straight-to-video stalk-and-slash movie but he does not march around the West End wearing a sandwich board predicting armageddon unless we all stop eating peanuts this minute. Some types of weirdness would probably not be encouraged even by Bob Wilson. But Sweden's defence in the 1994 World Cup was doubtless strengthened by the presence of wild-eyed Tomas Ravelli. It would surely increase the concentration of any centre-half to know the man standing behind him looked as if he would have been happier chasing Shelley Duvall around the Overlook Hotel with an axe than picking the ball out of the net. Wilson's tireless campaign has had an impact on football thinking. Nowadays one suspects that, just as coaches look for pace in strikers, they are also actively seeking delirium in potential keepers.",

      "bodyText": "Ieuan Wyn Jones, the odds on favourite to succeed Dafydd Wigley as leader of Plaid Cymru, yesterday declared his hand. At his campaign launch in Cardiff Bay Mr Jones, the MP and Assembly Member for Ynys Mon (Anglesey), said Plaid Cymru, which stunned Labour by capturing the Rhondda and Islwyn in last year's assembly election, must reach out to new supporters in urban and city areas and \"build on the support from non-Welsh speakers\". He would be putting forward a \"positive programme\" outlining how to achieve Plaid's immediate objective of full law making powers for the national assembly while maintaining a belief in eventual \"full national status\" within the EU. Mr Wigley announced last week that he is to stand down as head of the party on medical grounds after almost a decade as president. Mr Jones, 51, who will relinquish his Westminster seat at the general election, favours splitting the roles of president of the party and assembly leader but is putting his name forward for both so the party as a whole can decide who the leader in the assembly should be. Two other potential candidates for the leadership, the MEP Jill Evans, and Helen Mary Jones, who chairs the Plaid Cymru group in the assembly, are expected to make their intentions known later this week. Nominations close on June 30 and voting will take place on a one member one vote basis at branch meetings in July.",

      "byline": "Lee Elliot Major",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Top American universities are opening their arms to students from the UK, urging them to apply for places for the next academic year. The lure of state-of-the-art sports facilities, multi-million pound libraries, large scholarships and admissions procedures which bend over backwards to judge applicants on potential not privilege could trigger a stampede to campuses across the Atlantic.</p> <p>This threatens to be the unintended consequence of Chancellor Gordon Brown's attack on Oxford University for being elitist after one of its colleges rejected Laura Spence, the Tyneside comprehensive sixth-former with 10 A-starred GCSEs. She later secured a place and a \u00a365,000 scholarship at Harvard.</p> <p>Now the government's attempts to strike a populist note before the next election look like backfiring among other school-leavers. Many are now being tempted to follow in Spence's footsteps. Only they are unlikely to bother applying to Oxbridge or other UK universities in the first place.</p> <p>Professor David Blanchflower, head of economics at Dartmouth College, urges more UK students to apply to his college - which along with Harvard, Princeton and Yale is one of the prestigious Ivy League institutions in the north-eastern US: \"The college would be interested in receiving a limited number of talented students' applications from the UK.\"</p> <p>Harvard, meanwhile, has reported an increase in applications from UK students in the past year. But Sally Baker, head of admissions, stressed that UK students still make up only a tiny proportion of undergraduates - only 16 out of 6,500 students enrolled last year were from the UK. These few benefit from the university's huge endowment reserves, estimated at $15bn (\u00a310bn). Last year the university raised an extra $200m (\u00a3134m) from almumni and private donations for student financial aid in particular - an extra $2,000 (\u00a31,340) a year for students on scholarships.</p> <p>Even US institutions with smaller reserves put our richest universities to shame. Dartmouth College and Oxford have roughly the same financial reserves (\u00a31.5bn) and similar student intakes (4,000 undergraduates a year). Dartmouth recently spent \u00a367m updating its library; its sports facilities include a 20,000 seater stadium. Oxford's facilities are small scale by comparison. The local professional football team, Oxford United, let alone the university, would envy Dartmouth's all-seater stadium.</p> <p>Reports suggest, though, that it is Harvard's transformation from \"a finishing school for elites\" into an institution open to talent from all backgrounds, colours and classes that has inspired Brown in his summer breaks in the US. Nearly a quarter of Dartmouth's students are from minority backgrounds, against 6% at Oxford.</p> <p>Many government advisers behind the scenes at Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street also experienced at first hand the Ivy League's meritocratic admissions system. New Labour's inner circle won exclusive scholarships to study in the US after Oxbridge. Brown's right-hand man Ed Balls, for instance, went to Oxford then Harvard. The head of the prime minister's policy unit, David Miliband, went to MIT.</p> <p>The government plans to announce measures to widen access in universities when Whitehall's spending review ends next month. This will include money for Harvard-style recruiters to trawl state schools in search of talent.</p> <p>Yet the US universities employ radical measures to enrol gifted students. Needs-blind admissions systems ensure students' financial backgrounds are only probed after they have been accepted. Recommendations from high-school peers and aptitude tests are taken into account. And institutions recruit as many valedictorians - students coming top of their high school - as possible. In the UK this would mean that coming top at a local comp with good A-levels would give you a better chance at Oxbridge entrance than coming 57th at Eton.</p> <p>But all this comes at a price. US institutions are free to charge their own tuition fees. And economists will tell UK university heads this week that unless they embrace a similar commercial stance, they will be unable to stem the brain drain of academic talent leaving for US universities. </p> <p><strong>Why money matters</strong></p> <p><strong> Dartmouth College</strong> is a private university based in New Hampshire in the US. It is one of eight prestigious academic institutions, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, all in the north-eastern US, known as the Ivy League - which began as an amateur intercollegiate football league in the 1930s. Dartmouth has an endowment fund approaching $2bn (\u00a31.33bn) and has 4,200 undergraduates and around 500 graduate students.</p> <p><strong> Fees:</strong> Many US universities charge fees for tuition and board in excess of $30,000 (\u00a320,000), even those outside the Ivy League that do not have large endowments. At Dartmouth, tuition and fees for 1998/9 were approx $24,000 (\u00a316,000). </p> <p><strong> Scholarships:</strong> Dartmouth spent $26.2m (\u00a317.5m) on needs-blind scholarships in 1997-98. Students are only asked about their financial needs after being accepted. Two-fifths of students received financial aid at an average of $15,058 (\u00a310,000) per year.</p> <p>Scholarships at Dartmouth are skewed heavily to minority groups. In 1996-97, 89% of African-American students received on average $18,300 (\u00a312,200) a year; 80% of Native American students received on average $18,581 (\u00a312,400) a year; 69% of Latino students re ceived on average $17,639 (\u00a311,750) a year; 46% of Asian-American students received on average $15,435 (\u00a310,300) a year; two-thirds of international students received on average $24,000 (\u00a316,000) a year. </p> <p><strong> Social diversity:</strong> Dartmouth's class of 2001 included 5% African-American, 12% Asian-American, 5% Hispanic, and 2% Native American students. </p> <p><strong> School intake:</strong> 31% of students are from private schools at Dartmouth. But 28% of students are valedictorians (first in their high-school class) and 9% salutatorians (second). </p> <p><strong> Graduate debts:</strong> $50,000 (\u00a333,330) isn't unusual and much more than this for graduates of medical, law or business schools. </p> <p><strong> University resources: </strong> Harvard spent $67m (\u00a344.7m) in 1998/9 on its library - with 991 staff. Dartmouth is about to spend $100m (\u00a366.65m) improving its library. </p> <p><strong> Student facilities at Dartmouth include:</strong> a golf course, ski area, five gyms, two swimming pools, a 20,000-seater stadium, indoor and outdoor tracks and a range of sports and social facilities. </p> <p><strong> Lecturers' pay: </strong> At Dartmouth, assistant profs - equivalent to junior lecturers in the UK - are paid $51,800 (\u00a334,500). Full professors are paid $88,700 (\u00a359,100). </p> <p>With assets accrued over 800 years, <strong>Oxford University</strong>'s 36 colleges are thought to have \u00a31.58bn in endowment capital. Their joint endowments generate \u00a363m every year. In 1997-98, the university enrolled 4,023 undergraduates. Oxford is autonomous but fees are largely paid by the state. The vice-chancellor is one of 19 university heads which make up the Russell Group, named after the London hotel they meet in. This week the group will consider a report by economists on moves to a US-type funding system of fees and scholarships.</p> <p><strong> Fees:</strong> Full-time undergraduates whose family income exceeds \u00a328,000 have to contribute the maximum \u00a31,025 flat-rate tuition fee. The government estimates that a third of students in universities pay the full fee, a third pay a contribution and the rest pay nothing. </p> <p><strong> Scholarships/loans:</strong> The government has scrapped its maintenance grant for living costs. Student loans are replacing this grant, with a maximum of \u00a34,480 available in London, and \u00a33,635 outside London for the academic year 1999/2000. There are no scholarships for undergraduates, although University College plans to award two or three bursaries in a scheme to fund students from state schools with no tradition of Oxford applicants. There are some university and college grants for travel, hardship and books. The government provides \u00a3654,311 Access Funds. The university also has Hardship Funds administered by the Committee on Student Hardship. </p> <p><strong> Social diversity:</strong> According to the latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 6.24% of Oxford students were from ethnic minority backgrounds in 1997-98. </p> <p><strong> School intake:</strong> According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, 47% of Oxford's student intake came from state schools and colleges, 53% from private schools (which make up 7% of UK schools). </p> <p><strong> Graduate debts:</strong> students graduating in 1999 faced on average \u00a35,286 debt, up 17.5% on the previous year. These are the last students to graduate without paying fees. </p> <p><strong> University resources:</strong> In 1998-99 Oxford spent \u00a318.36m on central library and information services. This does not include college libraries - every college has its own. Oxford is building a new swimming pool and increasing its sporting facilities. Colleges have (or share) a boat house, tennis, football and cricket facilities. Some colleges also have gyms. </p> <p><strong> Lecturers' pay:</strong> In old universities, a young lecturer earns on average \u00a319,396, a professor \u00a342,836. </p> <p><strong>A tale of two students</strong></p> <p>Personal recommendations from fellow high school pupils are among a raft of measures used by Dartmouth College to make sure students are selected in the fairest possible way, according to Jesse Cook-Dubin, a third year Dartmouth undergraduate. </p> <p>The application process for Ivy League institutions is a long and arduous task - lasting over a year - with students assessed on high-school grades, aptitude tests, interviews and peer reviews. Only when students are finally accepted are they probed for financial details. </p> <p>Like many students, Cook-Dubin is only able to study at Dartmouth because of the scholarship offered by the college. \"I come from a family who live in a very average rural community,\" he says. \"There would have been no way that the family could pay for me to go to an institution such as Dartmouth.\" </p> <p>Cook-Dubin's parents invested a small amount of money when he was born, and this fund now pays for the costs not covered by the Dartmouth scholarship. Fees for tuition and board are $33,000 (\u00a322,000) a year. And like most US degrees, his American and English literature course will last four years. </p> <p>There was a day when Dartmouth was known as an all-white all Christian school. But now the onus is placed on opportunity for all. And the student intake at Dartmouth has become increasingly diverse. \"We all have the same opportunities for education - this has been drummed into us since school,\" he says. \"We are raised to believe that anyone can grow up to be president.\" A small minority complain that scholarships benefit those from families who have not worked as hard as others, but he says so many students are on financial aid that it is not big issue. </p> <p>Oxford's colleges must do much more to improve links with inner city schools and under-represented groups in universities if they want to broaden their student intake, says Oxford graduate Rosna Mortuza. Even with top A-level grades, most school students from poor or ethnic minority backgrounds still perceive Oxbridge as an enclave for the privileged white middle classes. A bigger barrier can be the preconceptions of teachers, who see Oxford and Cambridge as off-bounds for their pupils. </p> <p>\"I don't think the colleges and university are doing enough to promote themselves to show that they are serious about taking on more able students from inner city state schools and ethnic backgrounds,\" she says. </p> <p>During sixth form, Mortuza was lucky enough to meet a black Oxford undergraduate, who helped her to overcome the \"absurdity of perceptions of Oxford as a place only for white, public school boys\". She eventually graduated from Oxford with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics. During the degree, she became involved in the Oxford University Access Scheme and the Target Schools programme, both student-led and student-run schemes to encourage applicants to Oxbridge from \"non-traditional\" backgrounds. </p> <p>The Oxford Access Scheme encourages youngsters from inner-city and ethnic minority backgrounds to apply to Oxford by using undergraduates from similar backgrounds to challenge perceptions and raise aspirations. \"Although some colleges are beginning to be proactive,\" says Mortuza, \"there is much colleges can learn from the Access Scheme.\" </p> <p>While at Mansfield College, Rosna Mortuza was elected to be the college's first black and Muslim JCR president.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Top American universities are opening their arms to students from the UK, urging them to apply for places for the next academic year. The lure of state-of-the-art sports facilities, multi-million pound libraries, large scholarships and admissions procedures which bend over backwards to judge applicants on potential not privilege could trigger a stampede to campuses across the Atlantic. This threatens to be the unintended consequence of Chancellor Gordon Brown's attack on Oxford University for being elitist after one of its colleges rejected Laura Spence, the Tyneside comprehensive sixth-former with 10 A-starred GCSEs. She later secured a place and a \u00a365,000 scholarship at Harvard. Now the government's attempts to strike a populist note before the next election look like backfiring among other school-leavers. Many are now being tempted to follow in Spence's footsteps. Only they are unlikely to bother applying to Oxbridge or other UK universities in the first place. Professor David Blanchflower, head of economics at Dartmouth College, urges more UK students to apply to his college - which along with Harvard, Princeton and Yale is one of the prestigious Ivy League institutions in the north-eastern US: \"The college would be interested in receiving a limited number of talented students' applications from the UK.\" Harvard, meanwhile, has reported an increase in applications from UK students in the past year. But Sally Baker, head of admissions, stressed that UK students still make up only a tiny proportion of undergraduates - only 16 out of 6,500 students enrolled last year were from the UK. These few benefit from the university's huge endowment reserves, estimated at $15bn (\u00a310bn). Last year the university raised an extra $200m (\u00a3134m) from almumni and private donations for student financial aid in particular - an extra $2,000 (\u00a31,340) a year for students on scholarships. Even US institutions with smaller reserves put our richest universities to shame. Dartmouth College and Oxford have roughly the same financial reserves (\u00a31.5bn) and similar student intakes (4,000 undergraduates a year). Dartmouth recently spent \u00a367m updating its library; its sports facilities include a 20,000 seater stadium. Oxford's facilities are small scale by comparison. The local professional football team, Oxford United, let alone the university, would envy Dartmouth's all-seater stadium. Reports suggest, though, that it is Harvard's transformation from \"a finishing school for elites\" into an institution open to talent from all backgrounds, colours and classes that has inspired Brown in his summer breaks in the US. Nearly a quarter of Dartmouth's students are from minority backgrounds, against 6% at Oxford. Many government advisers behind the scenes at Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street also experienced at first hand the Ivy League's meritocratic admissions system. New Labour's inner circle won exclusive scholarships to study in the US after Oxbridge. Brown's right-hand man Ed Balls, for instance, went to Oxford then Harvard. The head of the prime minister's policy unit, David Miliband, went to MIT. The government plans to announce measures to widen access in universities when Whitehall's spending review ends next month. This will include money for Harvard-style recruiters to trawl state schools in search of talent. Yet the US universities employ radical measures to enrol gifted students. Needs-blind admissions systems ensure students' financial backgrounds are only probed after they have been accepted. Recommendations from high-school peers and aptitude tests are taken into account. And institutions recruit as many valedictorians - students coming top of their high school - as possible. In the UK this would mean that coming top at a local comp with good A-levels would give you a better chance at Oxbridge entrance than coming 57th at Eton. But all this comes at a price. US institutions are free to charge their own tuition fees. And economists will tell UK university heads this week that unless they embrace a similar commercial stance, they will be unable to stem the brain drain of academic talent leaving for US universities. Why money matters Dartmouth College is a private university based in New Hampshire in the US. It is one of eight prestigious academic institutions, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, all in the north-eastern US, known as the Ivy League - which began as an amateur intercollegiate football league in the 1930s. Dartmouth has an endowment fund approaching $2bn (\u00a31.33bn) and has 4,200 undergraduates and around 500 graduate students. Fees: Many US universities charge fees for tuition and board in excess of $30,000 (\u00a320,000), even those outside the Ivy League that do not have large endowments. At Dartmouth, tuition and fees for 1998/9 were approx $24,000 (\u00a316,000). Scholarships: Dartmouth spent $26.2m (\u00a317.5m) on needs-blind scholarships in 1997-98. Students are only asked about their financial needs after being accepted. Two-fifths of students received financial aid at an average of $15,058 (\u00a310,000) per year. Scholarships at Dartmouth are skewed heavily to minority groups. In 1996-97, 89% of African-American students received on average $18,300 (\u00a312,200) a year; 80% of Native American students received on average $18,581 (\u00a312,400) a year; 69% of Latino students re ceived on average $17,639 (\u00a311,750) a year; 46% of Asian-American students received on average $15,435 (\u00a310,300) a year; two-thirds of international students received on average $24,000 (\u00a316,000) a year. Social diversity: Dartmouth's class of 2001 included 5% African-American, 12% Asian-American, 5% Hispanic, and 2% Native American students. School intake: 31% of students are from private schools at Dartmouth. But 28% of students are valedictorians (first in their high-school class) and 9% salutatorians (second). Graduate debts: $50,000 (\u00a333,330) isn't unusual and much more than this for graduates of medical, law or business schools. University resources: Harvard spent $67m (\u00a344.7m) in 1998/9 on its library - with 991 staff. Dartmouth is about to spend $100m (\u00a366.65m) improving its library. Student facilities at Dartmouth include: a golf course, ski area, five gyms, two swimming pools, a 20,000-seater stadium, indoor and outdoor tracks and a range of sports and social facilities. Lecturers' pay: At Dartmouth, assistant profs - equivalent to junior lecturers in the UK - are paid $51,800 (\u00a334,500). Full professors are paid $88,700 (\u00a359,100). With assets accrued over 800 years, Oxford University's 36 colleges are thought to have \u00a31.58bn in endowment capital. Their joint endowments generate \u00a363m every year. In 1997-98, the university enrolled 4,023 undergraduates. Oxford is autonomous but fees are largely paid by the state. The vice-chancellor is one of 19 university heads which make up the Russell Group, named after the London hotel they meet in. This week the group will consider a report by economists on moves to a US-type funding system of fees and scholarships. Fees: Full-time undergraduates whose family income exceeds \u00a328,000 have to contribute the maximum \u00a31,025 flat-rate tuition fee. The government estimates that a third of students in universities pay the full fee, a third pay a contribution and the rest pay nothing. Scholarships/loans: The government has scrapped its maintenance grant for living costs. Student loans are replacing this grant, with a maximum of \u00a34,480 available in London, and \u00a33,635 outside London for the academic year 1999/2000. There are no scholarships for undergraduates, although University College plans to award two or three bursaries in a scheme to fund students from state schools with no tradition of Oxford applicants. There are some university and college grants for travel, hardship and books. The government provides \u00a3654,311 Access Funds. The university also has Hardship Funds administered by the Committee on Student Hardship. Social diversity: According to the latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 6.24% of Oxford students were from ethnic minority backgrounds in 1997-98. School intake: According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, 47% of Oxford's student intake came from state schools and colleges, 53% from private schools (which make up 7% of UK schools). Graduate debts: students graduating in 1999 faced on average \u00a35,286 debt, up 17.5% on the previous year. These are the last students to graduate without paying fees. University resources: In 1998-99 Oxford spent \u00a318.36m on central library and information services. This does not include college libraries - every college has its own. Oxford is building a new swimming pool and increasing its sporting facilities. Colleges have (or share) a boat house, tennis, football and cricket facilities. Some colleges also have gyms. Lecturers' pay: In old universities, a young lecturer earns on average \u00a319,396, a professor \u00a342,836. A tale of two students Personal recommendations from fellow high school pupils are among a raft of measures used by Dartmouth College to make sure students are selected in the fairest possible way, according to Jesse Cook-Dubin, a third year Dartmouth undergraduate. The application process for Ivy League institutions is a long and arduous task - lasting over a year - with students assessed on high-school grades, aptitude tests, interviews and peer reviews. Only when students are finally accepted are they probed for financial details. Like many students, Cook-Dubin is only able to study at Dartmouth because of the scholarship offered by the college. \"I come from a family who live in a very average rural community,\" he says. \"There would have been no way that the family could pay for me to go to an institution such as Dartmouth.\" Cook-Dubin's parents invested a small amount of money when he was born, and this fund now pays for the costs not covered by the Dartmouth scholarship. Fees for tuition and board are $33,000 (\u00a322,000) a year. And like most US degrees, his American and English literature course will last four years. There was a day when Dartmouth was known as an all-white all Christian school. But now the onus is placed on opportunity for all. And the student intake at Dartmouth has become increasingly diverse. \"We all have the same opportunities for education - this has been drummed into us since school,\" he says. \"We are raised to believe that anyone can grow up to be president.\" A small minority complain that scholarships benefit those from families who have not worked as hard as others, but he says so many students are on financial aid that it is not big issue. Oxford's colleges must do much more to improve links with inner city schools and under-represented groups in universities if they want to broaden their student intake, says Oxford graduate Rosna Mortuza. Even with top A-level grades, most school students from poor or ethnic minority backgrounds still perceive Oxbridge as an enclave for the privileged white middle classes. A bigger barrier can be the preconceptions of teachers, who see Oxford and Cambridge as off-bounds for their pupils. \"I don't think the colleges and university are doing enough to promote themselves to show that they are serious about taking on more able students from inner city state schools and ethnic backgrounds,\" she says. During sixth form, Mortuza was lucky enough to meet a black Oxford undergraduate, who helped her to overcome the \"absurdity of perceptions of Oxford as a place only for white, public school boys\". She eventually graduated from Oxford with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics. During the degree, she became involved in the Oxford University Access Scheme and the Target Schools programme, both student-led and student-run schemes to encourage applicants to Oxbridge from \"non-traditional\" backgrounds. The Oxford Access Scheme encourages youngsters from inner-city and ethnic minority backgrounds to apply to Oxford by using undergraduates from similar backgrounds to challenge perceptions and raise aspirations. \"Although some colleges are beginning to be proactive,\" says Mortuza, \"there is much colleges can learn from the Access Scheme.\" While at Mansfield College, Rosna Mortuza was elected to be the college's first black and Muslim JCR president.",

In a further new development, the 14 winning teachers will be invited to take part in \"best practice\" workshops in London in October to provide opportunities to network and share ideas. Winners of awards in the leadership categories will also be offered the chance to go on courses run by the Leadership Trust based in Ross-on-Wye, which aims to enhance and influence leadership development in all aspects of society. </p> <p>The awards were the brainchild of the Oscar-winning film producer David (Lord) Puttnam, who is now well established as a key figure in education as the chairman of the fledgling General Teaching Council and a member of many government education committees.

The Guardian is involved for the second year running, this year sponsoring the Teacher of the Year award. Watch this space - we will will be running detailed reports of the regional events over the next three weeks as well as a full-colour supplement on the national winners in the autumn. </p> <p><strong> Flo Witcombe</strong></p> <p>It's 2.00pm on a half-term Saturday and Flo Witcombe, winner of the Dorling Kindersley award for best new primary teacher, is in her classroom at Inverteign Junior School in Teignmouth. She has been at work creating a hanging display, Our Art Gallery. \"Anything that comes into range tends to get laminated,\" she explains. \"I wanted to get this done earlier on in the week but I went down with flu. It's classic - the immune system knows there's a chance of a rest and it tells the bugs 'come and get me'.\" </p> <p>Her thoughts return to the awards ceremony last July. \"When I realised I had won I felt sick with shock. The BBC had filmed me teaching but the crew said they were doing the same for all the finalists. Apparently, when it was announced on TV a yell went up from the houses near the school - someone said it sounded like England scoring a World Cup goal.\" </p> <p>Flo's nomination had been popular among parents. \"I grew up on an estate like the one many of our children come from and this definitely helped me relate to the parents. I also tried not to be too stiff. Just asking people to call me by my first name helped diffuse some of the tension at my first parents' evening.\" </p> <p>Flo was pleased to see the money she won benefiting pupils. The \u00a38,000 went on a minibus. \"It was provided by Leyland Daf at about half price - my winning definitely raised the profile of the school and helped us attract sponsorship.\" </p> <p>Her advice to anyone nominated for the 2000 award in her category is \"Go for it - it has been entirely positive for the school. It was also a huge pleasure for me being able to thank colleagues publicly for helping me during my first teaching years. You will have a lot of attention from the press and that can be hard to fit in. I was on the front page of the local newspaper for about four weeks running. But then they sorted out their news priorities and got back to other top stories, like children losing toys on the beach, so it didn't go to my head.\" </p> <p><strong> David Waugh</strong></p> <p> \"People should not be scared of taking flak from colleagues by accepting a nomination,\" says David Waugh, the first winner of the Dorling Kindersley best new secondary teacher award. His colleagues at Beauchamp College outside Leicester were right behind him all the way. \"But then the process was handled well there,\" he explains. \"It was democratic. Teachers, governors, parents and students all voted and my progress was public knowledge. </p> <p>\"It is quite a long haul. You are inspected as part of the regional assessments and again ahead of the final award. I had Ian Beer, the chairman of the Independent Schools' Council, with me for three lessons and students and colleagues were interviewed about me. On the day, at Alexandra Palace, I thought that the awards were going to be like the Oscars with a short film about each candidate, but no sooner had they shown my sequence than they were announcing my name. Then I was concentrating on the steep flight of stairs down to the stage, thinking 'Please don't let me fall'.\" </p> <p>David was keen that the money he won should buy something lasting. A portion of his \u00a33,500 regional winner prize money went to create an annual Beauchamp College Citizen of the Year Award aimed at the student who has made the biggest positive impact. The remaining cash awaits a special project. </p> <p>David's view of the awards is entirely positive. \"Some people may have confused the scheme with performance-related pay and fast tracking, and no doubt a lot of heads threw the award pack into the bin - but it had the support of all the teaching unions - an amazing thing. And after all, what is wrong with giving teachers some recognition and applause? If headteachers chuck out the chance for their staff to participate this year, it's my view they are failing in their duty as effective leaders.\" </p> <p><strong> Diana Sperry</strong></p> <p>Twenty thousand pounds seems like a lot of money until you come to spend it. That was the experience of Moat Farm Junior School in Sandwell. Diana Sperry, who won the Guardian award for the most creative use of information technology in a primary school, brought the Plato, the crystal statuette, back to a staff who had been busy constructing lists. </p> <p>\"We could have spent the money two, three times over,\" she said. Everyone was involved in the process - \"Parents, children, dinner ladies - everybody.\" Suggestions included a swimming pool and an adventure playground. Diana was concerned that the money shouldn't automatically be spent on technology, as the school's readiness to invest heavily in ICT was one of the factors that led to the win. </p> <p>The final shopping list reflects the reality of financial planning in hard-pressed urban schools. The biggest spend is on carpets and projection screens, followed by an upgraded security system. </p> <p>Evidence of the creativity that won the school the award in the first place is provided by the \u00a31,200 that is to be spent on a model dinosaur - a huge diplodocus, which will stand astride the school's main corridor with its head snaking down the walls. \"We wanted something that will be a lasting memento,\" said Diana. </p> <p>It's been a good year for her, with a visit to Australia to see their \"Navigator\" schools working with the very latest technology. </p> <p>The ceremony itself was a bit of a blur. \"The whole occasion was spectacular. I wish I could relive it knowing that I'd won.\" She's had hundreds of letters, some from complete strangers, some from names from the past: \"One from my old primary school headteacher. Phone calls from people I hadn't heard from for some time, letters from parents and children - including some I don't teach.\" </p> <p>Some people expected Diana to capitalise on the award and leave teaching for a career as a consultant. Presumably they hadn't met her. The day after the awards she returned to Moat Farm, where her class was being taught by a supply teacher. \"I just wanted to be with my class,\" she recalled. \"I'm not ready to leave that behind yet.\" </p> <p><strong> Keith Parry</strong></p> <p>In one of the less-than-affluent parts of Tameside in Greater Manchester, the Hyde Technology School is using the prize money from this year's awards to reach out into the community. Director of ICT Keith Parry picked up a \u00a320,000 cheque as the winner of the Guardian award for the most creative use of ICT in a secondary school. </p> <p>He's using half the award to buy 200 PCs at \u00a350 a time under the Tools for Schools scheme. The machines have been donated by commercial companies which might otherwise have dumped them in a landfill site. They will be refurbished and loaded with appropriate software - but they won't see any use in Hyde's classrooms. They'll be loaned out to families who can not afford a computer. </p> <p>\"Those with machines at home have an advantage when it comes to developing their skills,\" said Parry. \"We want to give that advantage to as wide a cross-section of students as possible.\" And the project isn't just aimed at the children. Parry also wants to see parents developing their confidence. Tameside has been hit badly with a series of factory closures and he sees the scheme as a means of allowing people to develop marketable skills. </p> <p>\"The likelihood is that as people get a feel for the machines, there will be a growing realisation of the kind of training they are going to require.\" And he's hoping the school could be there to deliver some of the training. </p> <p>The other half is going to support the school's already impressive video production facilities. \"We've bought some laptop computers that double as projection units,\" he explains. \"This makes it possible to work with whole classes.\" </p> <p>Hyde's pupils have produced a CD-Rom covering all aspects of life at the school. \"It will be distributed to all visitors on open night in November,\" says Parry. The advantage of the work with video is the way it can act as a motivator for pupils. </p> <p>Parry is very positive about the award. \"No downsides for me at all, it's been a great pleasure. We've been a bit reluctant to fly the flag here, but now people have been doing that on our behalf. It's the way we have projected it - as very much a school success.\"</p>",

You will have a lot of attention from the press and that can be hard to fit in. I was on the front page of the local newspaper for about four weeks running. But then they sorted out their news priorities and got back to other top stories, like children losing toys on the beach, so it didn't go to my head.\" David Waugh \"People should not be scared of taking flak from colleagues by accepting a nomination,\" says David Waugh, the first winner of the Dorling Kindersley best new secondary teacher award. His colleagues at Beauchamp College outside Leicester were right behind him all the way. \"But then the process was handled well there,\" he explains. \"It was democratic. Teachers, governors, parents and students all voted and my progress was public knowledge. \"It is quite a long haul. You are inspected as part of the regional assessments and again ahead of the final award. I had Ian Beer, the chairman of the Independent Schools' Council, with me for three lessons and students and colleagues were interviewed about me. On the day, at Alexandra Palace, I thought that the awards were going to be like the Oscars with a short film about each candidate, but no sooner had they shown my sequence than they were announcing my name. Then I was concentrating on the steep flight of stairs down to the stage, thinking 'Please don't let me fall'.\" David was keen that the money he won should buy something lasting. A portion of his \u00a33,500 regional winner prize money went to create an annual Beauchamp College Citizen of the Year Award aimed at the student who has made the biggest positive impact. The remaining cash awaits a special project. David's view of the awards is entirely positive. \"Some people may have confused the scheme with performance-related pay and fast tracking, and no doubt a lot of heads threw the award pack into the bin - but it had the support of all the teaching unions - an amazing thing. And after all, what is wrong with giving teachers some recognition and applause? If headteachers chuck out the chance for their staff to participate this year, it's my view they are failing in their duty as effective leaders.\" Diana Sperry Twenty thousand pounds seems like a lot of money until you come to spend it. That was the experience of Moat Farm Junior School in Sandwell. Diana Sperry, who won the Guardian award for the most creative use of information technology in a primary school, brought the Plato, the crystal statuette, back to a staff who had been busy constructing lists. \"We could have spent the money two, three times over,\" she said. Everyone was involved in the process - \"Parents, children, dinner ladies - everybody.\" Suggestions included a swimming pool and an adventure playground. Diana was concerned that the money shouldn't automatically be spent on technology, as the school's readiness to invest heavily in ICT was one of the factors that led to the win. The final shopping list reflects the reality of financial planning in hard-pressed urban schools. The biggest spend is on carpets and projection screens, followed by an upgraded security system. Evidence of the creativity that won the school the award in the first place is provided by the \u00a31,200 that is to be spent on a model dinosaur - a huge diplodocus, which will stand astride the school's main corridor with its head snaking down the walls. \"We wanted something that will be a lasting memento,\" said Diana. It's been a good year for her, with a visit to Australia to see their \"Navigator\" schools working with the very latest technology. The ceremony itself was a bit of a blur. \"The whole occasion was spectacular. I wish I could relive it knowing that I'd won.\" She's had hundreds of letters, some from complete strangers, some from names from the past: \"One from my old primary school headteacher. Phone calls from people I hadn't heard from for some time, letters from parents and children - including some I don't teach.\" Some people expected Diana to capitalise on the award and leave teaching for a career as a consultant. Presumably they hadn't met her. The day after the awards she returned to Moat Farm, where her class was being taught by a supply teacher. \"I just wanted to be with my class,\" she recalled. \"I'm not ready to leave that behind yet.\" Keith Parry In one of the less-than-affluent parts of Tameside in Greater Manchester, the Hyde Technology School is using the prize money from this year's awards to reach out into the community. Director of ICT Keith Parry picked up a \u00a320,000 cheque as the winner of the Guardian award for the most creative use of ICT in a secondary school. He's using half the award to buy 200 PCs at \u00a350 a time under the Tools for Schools scheme. The machines have been donated by commercial companies which might otherwise have dumped them in a landfill site. They will be refurbished and loaded with appropriate software - but they won't see any use in Hyde's classrooms. They'll be loaned out to families who can not afford a computer. \"Those with machines at home have an advantage when it comes to developing their skills,\" said Parry. \"We want to give that advantage to as wide a cross-section of students as possible.\" And the project isn't just aimed at the children. Parry also wants to see parents developing their confidence. Tameside has been hit badly with a series of factory closures and he sees the scheme as a means of allowing people to develop marketable skills. \"The likelihood is that as people get a feel for the machines, there will be a growing realisation of the kind of training they are going to require.\" And he's hoping the school could be there to deliver some of the training. The other half is going to support the school's already impressive video production facilities. \"We've bought some laptop computers that double as projection units,\" he explains. \"This makes it possible to work with whole classes.\" Hyde's pupils have produced a CD-Rom covering all aspects of life at the school. \"It will be distributed to all visitors on open night in November,\" says Parry. The advantage of the work with video is the way it can act as a motivator for pupils. Parry is very positive about the award. \"No downsides for me at all, it's been a great pleasure. We've been a bit reluctant to fly the flag here, but now people have been doing that on our behalf. It's the way we have projected it - as very much a school success.\"",

Why? Possibly because males are most comfortable with the Sat's emphasis on speed. The College Board reports that female test-takers come from families with lower incomes and have parents with less education. And yet female college records are consistently better - challenging the test as a predictor of first-year college grades.</p> <p>White students' closest competitors are Asian students, who sometimes outperform them. Schaeffer attributes this to the high pressure cultures from which these students hail.

The language barrier also presents major burdens for Hispanic students.</p> <p>The lowest scores come from African-Americans and low-income minorities.

Many don't even finish them. Coaching devices can improve scores by 100 points, but some cost $700 or more. FairTest literature says this also \"skews scores in favour of higher-income test-takers\".</p> <p>Schaeffer applauds colleges that don't rely on the Sat and says the rest should make the test optional, and also use other measures such as high-school grades, class rank, leadership skills and non-academic factors such as community service to avoid distorting admissions. He also maintains that the Sat should never be used alone - if it is, \"College Board should enforce the user guidelines and stop making the test scores available to them\".</p> <p>It is only America's top 100, extremely competitive universities that are most likely to be misusing the Sat. But even they have former students who broke the mould and did not achieve a top Sat score.</p> <p>One of them will be the next president of the US.

His promise to restore headteachers' right to exclude unruly pupils at will was condemned last night by the government as incoherent, uncosted and unworkable.

He will also emphasise that heads have the right to exclude violent or severely disruptive pupils immediately, amid efforts to reduce exclusions overall. Mr Hague's references to the \"elitism\" of the New Labour government as \"the real enemy of good education in Britain\" are intended to hit back at the government over its claims to be seeking greater fairness in education with attacks on Oxbridge \"elitist\" selection systems. The Tory leader, whose education team has frequently stated party opposition to current government policy on exclusion, will also use his speech to condemn what he calls the \"politically correct nonsense\" of the liberal elite, including moves to abolish section 28 and recent criticism of the game of musical chairs as unfair to children who lose. But teaching unions are certain to despair that day-to-day classroom concerns have become the latest political football to be kicked between the parties, just as the complexities of university selection were lost amid the row over the refusal of an Oxford place to the Tyneside teenager Laura Spence.

He intended to cause \"murder, mayhem, chaos and damage\" and \"to spread fear, resentment and hatred throughout the country\", the jury heard.</p> <p>His third bomb, left at the bar of the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, central London, on April 30 last year, was not, however, a political statement, said Nigel Sweeney, QC, prosecuting. \"It was personal. The defendant told police that he was very homophobic. He hated gay men and he said his hatred stemmed from the way his parents had treated him as a child. He regarded gay men as perverted degenerates who were no use to society and should be put to death.\"</p> <p>Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant, John Light, 32, and Nick Moore, 31, were killed by the blast.

He came up with the idea when a bomb went off in Centennial park during the Olympic Games in Atlanta four years ago.</p> <p>\"He told police that the Notting Hill carnival was on at about the same time,\" said Mr Sweeney. \"He began to wish that someone would blow up the Notting Hill carnival. To start off with he treated the thought as a joke, but he could not get it out of his head. The thought became stronger. He woke up one day and decided he was going to do it.\"</p> <p>Copeland wanted to make \"proper bombs\". In April, 1997, he downloaded a manual called the Terrorists' Handbook at a cyber cafe in Victoria, central London. But he found it difficult to follow the instructions for making one of the chemical ingredients and gave up.</p> <p>One night in 1998 when he was bored, he looked at the manual again and saw instructions for making a \"pipe bomb\", which was less sophisticated. Referring to another guide on the internet, How to Make Bombs part 2, he set about collecting the materials.</p> <p>Copeland bought \u00a31,500 of fireworks from two stores in Farnborough, Hants, and ignition devices from a firm in Dorset. He used old-fashioned alarm clocks as his timers. He packed up to 1,500 nails in each completed device, which he taped into sports holdalls.</p> <p>Before heading to Brixton for the first attack, he experimented with different mixtures of \"flash powder\" to get the biggest explosion, blowing up small lengths of pipe at a common near the bedsit he rented from a local vicar.</p> <p>With the bomb, primed to go off at 5.30pm, in a bag slung over his shoulder, Copeland took a train to London on Saturday, April 17, last year, and then a taxi to Brixton, which he believed to be the heart of London's black community.</p> <p>He told detectives he was surprised to find so many white people shopping there. \"He did not care about hurting them,\" Mr Sweeney told the court. \"He told the police: 'If they want to live there, that's up to them'.\"</p> <p>After scouting the area, Copeland decided to leave the bag next to a bus stop outside the busy Iceland store on the corner of Electric Avenue.</p> <p>But before it detonated, an unlicensed street trader picked it up. Another man took the bomb out of the bag and put it on a stack of wooden pallets at the side of the Iceland shop.</p> <p>The jury was shown CCTV pictures of the scene just before the explosion. The bomb was clearly visible and a security guard from the store was trying to usher people away from it, though nobody was taking him seriously.

Forty people were injured, including two who lost an eye and a 23-month-old child who had a nail embedded in his skull.</p> <p>A week later, Copeland went to Brick Lane, which he believed to be the centre of London's Asian community. He wanted to plant a bomb in the middle of the busy market, but discovered he was a day early.</p> <p>Mr Sweeney said Copeland dumped the bag, but a passerby, Gerrard Lynch, spotted it and tried to hand it in to a local police office, which was closed.

A number of other victims suffered dreadful injuries.\"</p> <p>Four people lost one or both of their lower limbs, another lost an arm.</p> <p>By the time Copeland returned home, the police were on his trail.

      "bodyText": "More than 800 known or suspected English football hooligans could be prevented from attending the Euro 2000 football tournament this summer, after British police passed their names to authorities in Belgium and Holland. The list includes more than 500 hooligans with domestic or international banning orders against them, plus 300 people suspected of football violence whom police believe are intent on causing violent disorder. Both Holland and Belgium, the tournament's co-hosts, have laws permitting preventative detention of undesirables, and have made it clear that they will refuse entry to anyone they believe may cause trouble. Last month Jack Straw, home secretary, turned down the opportunity to introduce legislation allowing the passports of known hooligans to be confiscated, as it would not be passed before the four-week tournament begins this Saturday. After a meeting with Dutch, Belgian and British police and Football Association representatives yesterday, Mr Straw blamed \"Conservative mavericks\" and \"a pusillanimous Tory front bench\" for failing to support the legislation when it was introduced last year. Rejecting the criticism, Ann Widdecombe, shadow home secretary, said Mr Straw had abdicated responsibility by leaving it up to the host countries to turn hooligans away at their borders. \"Why don't we stop them at ours?\" Mr Straw said he was confident that the authorities in the host countries and British police had done everything within their power to prevent violence. \"The preparations for this tournament have been far more intensive than they were for the World Cup in France in 1998, and we have built on that experience,\" he said. \"In the end it is down to the Dutch and Belgian authorities.\" English hooligans were widely condemned after rioting in Marseille during the World Cup. Tension has been heightened recently by disturbances abroad involving English supporters. Two Leeds fans were killed in Istanbul after travelling to see their club play Galatasaray, and there were running battles between Arsenal and Galatasaray fans in Copenhagen last month. Detective Superintendent Brian Drew, head of the football unit of the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS), said: \"Dutch and Belgian police have attended every one of England's qualifying matches in the run-up to the tournament, and they have seen how English fans behave both at home and away. \"They were also present in Copenhagen, and I am confident that they have the power to stop that sort of thing taking place.\" At yesterday's meeting Dutch and Belgian authorities assured Mr Straw that they would charge and convict English supporters involved in violence - rather than deporting troublemakers, as the Danes did last month - allowing the British courts to issue orders banning them from travelling to future matches abroad. The National Federation of Football Supporters' Clubs insisted that, despite intelligence provided to the Dutch and Belgians by the NCIS, not enough had been done to prevent hooligans from travelling to the competition. \"It is inevitable that there will be trouble at Euro 2000,\" said Ian Todd, the federation's chairman. \"The government is struggling to recover from a situation they made for themselves when they chickened out of introducing that legislation.\" England's first match, against Portugal, is in Eindhoven, Holland, next Monday, followed five days later by one against Germany in the small Belgian town of Charleroi, which many believe will be a flashpoint for serious trouble.",

      "body": "<p><strong>PELE WHIPS UP A STORM</strong></p> <p>Earlier today, when Edson Arantes do Nascimento skipped out of his Rio beach house in his skimpy Koogan-style briefs, he was greeted by a thunderous downpour - which was strange because it hadn't rained in nearly a decade. But while the sight was greeted by gasps of amazement by Brazilian weathermen, and sighs of bewilderment from the children in the barrios, there was one person who just shrugged her head and thought: \"Here we go again.\"</p> <p>That person was Mrs Pele, wife of Brazilian legend Pele, who'd heard him cheerfully predict sunny times ahead just the night before. But that setback didn't stop the great man turning his gaze to the low countries and picking Steve McManaman and Henrik Larsson as the men who will stand out in Euro 2000. \"Four years ago when England were the hosts, McManaman was one of the players who impressed me most in the tournament,\" claimed Pele, who'd obviously been watching on radio. \"He had great pace and skill and wasn't afraid to take defenders on and beat them,\" the great man continued. \"I don't know what happened to McManaman in the last few years, but I see he is back where he should be - as one of the finest players in Europe.\" </p> <p>And because Pele's state-of-the-art satellite system also picks up the finest Swedish TV (it's for the football, Mrs Pele), he also felt qualified to talk about Henrik Larsson. \"He had the injury, but if I were the coach I might take the risk,\" Pele told the Daily Record. \"You have 22 players and you can take a risk with one - otherwise after only three matches it might be too late. I think that coaches sometimes need to show more courage.\" Just the kind of stirring words to get our Kelvin and Swedish coach Tommy Svensson talking up their Euro 2000 prospects - at least until they realise that Pele also predicted that Colombia would win the World Cup in 1994 and an African nation would win it by 2000.

Plagued by a chronic need to indulge in ginormous amounts of hard drugs? Chances are you're suffering from Diegorrhea, an excessive amount of sympathy for the plight of poor old stumpy Argentine cheat Diego Maradona. Help is at hand however, as Diego himself appears to be making a miraculous recovery from his recent 'heart difficulties'.</p> <p>\"After a spectacular improvement he has reached a plateau and now the advance will come bit by bit. I think we will succeed,\" said Diego's personal doctor Alfredo Cahe this week. Dr Cahe, who has treated Maradona since he was 16 - and what sterling work he's done - went on to explain just how successful the treatment has been. \"Diego has achieved abstinence from drugs,\" he said. \"He has achieved an understanding of abstinence.\" Er, right. The Fiver has an understanding of abstinence too, but that doesn't stop us from indulging in all-night sex orgies with glamour models.</p> <p>Oh, alright, it does, but you get our point. Anyway, the wonderful Dr Cahe believes that, as long as Diego stays in Cuba, he'll be well again by the end of the year. And as far as Diego is concerned his heart is now 60% fit, up 30% from his last professional self-assessment. Which should explain why he has reportedly spent the last week indulging in endless barbecues with his Argentine mates whilst diving into swimming pools fully clothed screaming \"Gooooooool!\". \"In Cuba, I am happy. I love Cuba,\" he said this week. Sounds like.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I may look different, but everyone knows that inside I am the same player and same person.

      "byline": "Matthew Norman",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br>A colleague sends me something from the internet - the summary of a research paper by Professor Giovanni Andrea Fava, editor of that popular top shelf publication Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics. \"Hypochondriasis can be treated, but is nurtured by medical information,\" is the title. Even if this makes Prof Fava sounds like ante-post favourite for editorship of Bleeding Obvious Monthly, I suppose there may be something in his \"explanatory theory\". However, I feel much too sinusy to examine the matter today. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br>I awake, as always, feeling thick-headed and with a face that aches from the forehead to the cheekbones that lie buried beneath so much fat. More and more I regret cancelling the submuchosal resection on my significantly deviated septum, because my breathing is worse than ever. I am even thinking about a homeopath recommended by a friend with chronic cystitis - a practitioner more likely to improve my quality of life, it occurs to me, than Prof Fava of the University of Bologna. </p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong><br>I still cannot read the hypochondriasis paper, as I tell Rebecca while she is juicing some mouldy mangos - a diet-related activity which, in her hands, takes on an unsettlingly Freudian air. \"You don't want to read it in case it's helpful,\" she says, grabbing a particularly withered piece of fruit. \"You're terrified of being cured. If you lost your hypochondria, you'd lose the crutch on which you limp through life.\" Somehow the pedantic mid-sentence placement of the preposition irritates me even more than the sentiment, but I respond maturely by saying \"yaiss, yaiss, very wise, oh yaiss\", while nodding my head in savagely ironic agreement, until a familiar tinkling sends me scurrying for dustpan and brush. </p> <p><strong>Friday</strong><br>\"Hypochondriasis (the conviction of being seriously ill despite no objective medical evidence) is often regarded as a chronic and disabling condition, refractory to treatment,\" writes Prof Fava. \"A randomized controlled trial performed at the University of Bologna would suggest this is not the case.\" The finding, if this isn't too technical, seems to be that patients whose doctors explain why they can't possibly have the illnesses they fear tend to worry less than those whose doctors don't. And all those years I thought Italian medicine began and ended with prescribing suppositories. </p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong><br>Over the years, I reflect while browsing through the vitamins at the Pestle and Mortar chemist, I have enjoyed a fair amount of \"explanatory therapy\" from my physician Sarah Jarvis, of the \"You do not have colon cancer because you do not have any symptoms\" variety, and from my wife. And yet the hypochondriasis is, if anything, worse than in 1991, the year I first entered Room 19 at the Grove surgery and later became shackled by the bonds of holy wedlock. </p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong><br>After lunch, we put explanatory theory into practice when I complain vigorously of pain in my left thumb and elbow. I diagnose the onset of motor neurone disease, but Rebecca, taking the role of Prof Fava, dissents. \"Can you think of any activity that might explain it?\" she asks pleasantly, allowing the good cop half of her routine an early outing in the tacit understanding that the bad cop was not too far away. \"Nothing,\" I reply, \"nothing at all.\" \"What were you doing until 2.30am with your friend Giles?\" \"Playing FIFA 2000 football on the Playstation.\" \"Show me how you hold the thing when you play.\" Reluctantly I mime. My elbow is held at an artificially raised angle, while the thumb is extended and at full pressure to the button. I take her point. Perhaps there is something in explanatory theory after all. </p> <p><strong>Monday</strong><br>I awake feeling nervy and distressed, having passed a very troubled night. In this dream, I am lying on the mortuary slab while Dr Jarvis and Rebecca discuss what they should put down as cause of death. \"Well, literally, it was the colono-rectal cancer,\" says the doctor. \"Yes,\" says my widow, \"but every time he complained of passing blood, I pointed to all the empty jars of beetroot and told him not to be so silly. If he'd been treated sooner, he might have been all right.\" \"Perhaps,\" says Dr Jarvis, \"but at least you cured him of his hypochondriasis.\" Taking a fountain pen to the death certificate, the doctor writes \"explanatory theory\" under cause of death, and pausing only to laugh at the irony, the two women leave me to eternity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tuesday A colleague sends me something from the internet - the summary of a research paper by Professor Giovanni Andrea Fava, editor of that popular top shelf publication Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics. \"Hypochondriasis can be treated, but is nurtured by medical information,\" is the title. Even if this makes Prof Fava sounds like ante-post favourite for editorship of Bleeding Obvious Monthly, I suppose there may be something in his \"explanatory theory\". However, I feel much too sinusy to examine the matter today. Wednesday I awake, as always, feeling thick-headed and with a face that aches from the forehead to the cheekbones that lie buried beneath so much fat. More and more I regret cancelling the submuchosal resection on my significantly deviated septum, because my breathing is worse than ever. I am even thinking about a homeopath recommended by a friend with chronic cystitis - a practitioner more likely to improve my quality of life, it occurs to me, than Prof Fava of the University of Bologna. Thursday I still cannot read the hypochondriasis paper, as I tell Rebecca while she is juicing some mouldy mangos - a diet-related activity which, in her hands, takes on an unsettlingly Freudian air. \"You don't want to read it in case it's helpful,\" she says, grabbing a particularly withered piece of fruit. \"You're terrified of being cured. If you lost your hypochondria, you'd lose the crutch on which you limp through life.\" Somehow the pedantic mid-sentence placement of the preposition irritates me even more than the sentiment, but I respond maturely by saying \"yaiss, yaiss, very wise, oh yaiss\", while nodding my head in savagely ironic agreement, until a familiar tinkling sends me scurrying for dustpan and brush. Friday \"Hypochondriasis (the conviction of being seriously ill despite no objective medical evidence) is often regarded as a chronic and disabling condition, refractory to treatment,\" writes Prof Fava. \"A randomized controlled trial performed at the University of Bologna would suggest this is not the case.\" The finding, if this isn't too technical, seems to be that patients whose doctors explain why they can't possibly have the illnesses they fear tend to worry less than those whose doctors don't. And all those years I thought Italian medicine began and ended with prescribing suppositories. Saturday Over the years, I reflect while browsing through the vitamins at the Pestle and Mortar chemist, I have enjoyed a fair amount of \"explanatory therapy\" from my physician Sarah Jarvis, of the \"You do not have colon cancer because you do not have any symptoms\" variety, and from my wife. And yet the hypochondriasis is, if anything, worse than in 1991, the year I first entered Room 19 at the Grove surgery and later became shackled by the bonds of holy wedlock. Sunday After lunch, we put explanatory theory into practice when I complain vigorously of pain in my left thumb and elbow. I diagnose the onset of motor neurone disease, but Rebecca, taking the role of Prof Fava, dissents. \"Can you think of any activity that might explain it?\" she asks pleasantly, allowing the good cop half of her routine an early outing in the tacit understanding that the bad cop was not too far away. \"Nothing,\" I reply, \"nothing at all.\" \"What were you doing until 2.30am with your friend Giles?\" \"Playing FIFA 2000 football on the Playstation.\" \"Show me how you hold the thing when you play.\" Reluctantly I mime. My elbow is held at an artificially raised angle, while the thumb is extended and at full pressure to the button. I take her point. Perhaps there is something in explanatory theory after all. Monday I awake feeling nervy and distressed, having passed a very troubled night. In this dream, I am lying on the mortuary slab while Dr Jarvis and Rebecca discuss what they should put down as cause of death. \"Well, literally, it was the colono-rectal cancer,\" says the doctor. \"Yes,\" says my widow, \"but every time he complained of passing blood, I pointed to all the empty jars of beetroot and told him not to be so silly. If he'd been treated sooner, he might have been all right.\" \"Perhaps,\" says Dr Jarvis, \"but at least you cured him of his hypochondriasis.\" Taking a fountain pen to the death certificate, the doctor writes \"explanatory theory\" under cause of death, and pausing only to laugh at the irony, the two women leave me to eternity.",

Or take a midnight walk around the neon-lit entertainment districts of Shinjuku or Namba and it's clear from the crumpled figures on the pavement that this is also a land of heroic drinking - and a growing alcohol problem. Yet for all this, the 126 million Japanese can expect to live longer and more active lives than anyone else, according to a new report from the World Health Organisation. The average healthy life expectancy in Japan is now 74.5 years, comfortably ahead of France, in second place with 73.2 years, and leagues ahead of Britain, in 14th spot with 71.7 years. </p> <p>The most commonly cited and convincing explanation is Japan's traditional low-fat and varied diet. Raw fish, green tea, seaweed and pickled plums (so sour that they make your eyes water) are all believed to contribute to some of the lowest rates of cancer and heart disease in the world. </p> <p>Take the Abe family, a fairly typical household living on the outskirts of Tokyo. Steelworker Hideo Abe is a smoker and a drinker but he expects to live past 70. The reason, he says, is that his grandparents and great grandparents all lived well into their 90s on a diet that was very similar to his own. </p> <p>The Abes start the day with a bowl of miso and tofu soup, white rice and a few strips of nori (laver seaweed). As a breakfast, it might not sound as tasty as a British fry-up, but it wins hands down in terms of calories and good nutrition. </p> <p>For lunch, Mr Abe orders a \"bento\", a boxed meal that contains at least 10 different - all neatly compartmentalised - types of food ranging from pickles and salad to fish and the staple white rice. Mothers send their children off to school with similar bentos, which ensure a far more balanced diet than the usual British fare of sandwiches or meat and two-veg. Mr Abe also makes sure he has a piece of fruit. </p> <p>For the evening meal, Mrs Abe prepares numerous small dishes. Fish is usually the main one - more than half of the Japanese intake of protein comes from the sea. On the occasions when the Abes do have red meat, they prefer it as \"shabu shabu\": wafer thin slices of meat that are boiled for just a few seconds. </p> <p>The Abes wash these meals down with green tea. Although it's made from the same leaves as the black tea popular in the west, it is not fermented, which means it retains more polyphenols, antioxidants that are believed to fight cancer. It is also drunk without milk or sugar, which ensures less fat and fewer calories. </p> <p>The Abes enjoy alcohol, but like many Japanese, they have recently cut down on beer and sake, and started drinking more red wine. Underlining the health-consciousness of the country, imports of Burgundy have more than tripled since researchers found that red wine may reduce the risk of heart disease. </p> <p>Such a diet helps to explain why Japanese waistlines are less likely to bulge. Obesity is three times lower than in America and, as a result, there is a less risk of a heart attack or diabetes. </p> <p>But food alone cannot explain why the country is so healthy. The state has also played a key role, not only as a nanny, but as a nurse, policeman and personal trainer. To keep the nation in trim, the state-run NHK channel broadcasts music and instructions for calisthenic exercises at the crack of dawn each day. More importantly - and unlike the US, which was 24th on the WHO list - Japan is a truly egalitarian society. Once described as the only successful example of socialism, Japan has an average wage of \u00a322,000 and high standards of health care that are within reach of almost everyone. </p> <p>Change, though, is on the way, with western food and habits gradually catching on.

      "body": "<p>Thirty weeks into her first pregnancy, Jenny Chambers' limbs began to itch. She was told not to worry: at that time doctors and consultants were taught that itching during pregnancy was unimportant. But shortly before she was due to give birth, her daughter, Victoria, died in the womb. It was classed as an \"unexplained still birth\". These things happen, she was told, and it wouldn't happen next time. </p> <p>In 1988, pregnant for the second time, the itching began at 28 weeks. This time Chambers broke her kneecap in a fall and was admitted to hospital. Confined to her bed and constantly monitored, her baby was induced at 38 weeks. The little boy, Alex, was fine. </p> <p>In 1990 she was pregnant again with her daughter Olivia, and this time she became unbearably itchy after 27 weeks - hands, feet, arms, legs - \"an army of ants was marching under my skin\". She couldn't sleep. She scratched until she bled. </p> <p>Convinced there must be a link between the itching and the loss of the first baby, she and her husband begged the hospital to induce this one by 38 weeks, but they were repeatedly told they were worrying unnecessarily. \"No one was listening,\" Chambers says. Eventually, the doctors announced they would induce her at 39 weeks. </p> <p>Two days before the date set a hand-held heart monitor showed the baby - little Olivia - alive and well. Yet within six hours the baby was dead. After a short labour, Jenny held her in her arms. \"What amazed me was, she was so warm. So perfect. I didn't want to give her away. I wanted to get off the bed and run out of the hospital with her.\" </p> <p>The maternity unit called it another unexplained still birth, but Chambers was certain there was an explanation. A senior registrar suggested she talk to a different obstetrician called Judith Weaver in the same hospital. Chambers went to see her and asked: \"Do you know why my babies died?\" Weaver replied: \"Yes. I know exactly why they died.\" </p> <p>Weaver told her about obstetric cholestastis, an under-reported and under-diagnosed condition of pregnancy which for some reason can cause stillbirth in pregnancies. Weaver explained that certain blood tests Jenny had during pregnancy had showed a disorder of her liver function - her bile production wasn't flowing normally, and bile had built up in her blood. This hadn't been picked up because her doctors had been taught it didn't matter as she wasn't jaundiced. But what they'd been taught was wrong. Weaver told Jenny that if her baby had been delivered by 38 weeks, \"she would have been alive today\". </p> <p>Grieving and shocked, Jenny and her husband considered suing the hospital. But instead they \"decided it was better to make sure it never happened again, to anyone else\". She threw herself into researching the disease. A friend - a GP who, like most, had never heard of obstetric cholestasis - downloaded articles from the internet. It was clear that if a woman itched in pregnancy, and her liver function tests proved abnormal, the chances were that she had OC, and the solution was simple - delivery by 37 or 38 weeks could prevent nearly every still birth caused by the disease. </p> <p>Chambers realised that just because a few top doctors had heard of the condition, it didn't mean the message had got into the system. So she began her intensive campaign to raise the OC profile. Through the helpline she set up, she met other women who had lost babies, and encouraged them to join her fight to spread the word. </p> <p>She never went back to her building society job. Instead she became a phlebotomist - someone trained to take blood - as a way into the NHS. Once inside the system, she spoke to people in labs working in clinical chemistry. She linked up with doctors who were starting research projects in Birmingham and London, and travelled the country lecturing to members of the medical profession. </p> <p>She sat on the board of a government inquiry into perinatal mortality and, at her insistence, the board included checks for liver function and bile acid in its battery of tests. Results showed that nearly 5% of unexplained still births were probably related to OC. This meant one baby a week in Britain was dying an easily preventable death. </p> <p>It was solely down to Jenny Chambers that during my latest pregnancy I reported itching to my consultant at Whipps Cross hospital in London. None of the (up-to-date) pregnancy books I'd bought mentioned OC in the index, but I'd read one of the paragraphs Chambers had placed in a baby magazine, and also the entry in the NHS pregnancy guide. My consultant referred me to a colleague, Catherine Nelson-Piercy, who diagnosed OC, a condition currently being researched at Whipps Cross. I was monitored daily, and induced just before 37 weeks. (Twins Imogen and Se\u00e1n are doing well). </p> <p>I was amazed how much respect Chambers, a lay person, had among medical professionals. Nelson-Piercy refers to her as her \"very good friend\" and credits her with the fact that a lot more people know about the disease now than did eight years ago. Andrew Shennan, a senior lecturer at St Thomas's hospital in London, who leads London-based research into the prevalence of OC, also considers Chambers to be \"hugely instrumental\" in raising understanding of the condition. He refers to her single-handed campaign as \"unique\". </p> <p>Current studies are far from complete. The prevalence research only began last August and relies for funding on the perinatal charity Tommy's Campaign. No one is yet sure how many pregnant women get OC (the guess is around 1% to 2% in this country), or how many of those pregnancies are likely to end in still birth if they go to term (possibly 2%). Nobody yet knows why there is a connection between OC and still birth - only that the connection exists. It is very much the case that most women who itch in pregnancy will suffer no ill effects. But there is no need to take chances, because the diagnosis is simple, as is the solution. </p> <p>Thanks to Chambers, most hospital consultants today are aware that itching is not necessarily benign and will investigate further. Nelson-Piercy agrees, however, that many GPs and midwives are still behind the times. Her message for pregnant women is: \"If you itch, don't just request a medical opinion - ask firmly to be given a liver function test.\" </p> <p>As for Jenny Chambers, after Olivia's death she vowed never to try for another child. But later, with Weaver as her consultant, she went on to have another son. Baby Tim was induced for everyone's peace of mind at 35 weeks, after another horribly itchy OC pregnancy. </p> <p>Now 42 years old, Chambers is sad she's never had another daughter, but she cannot regret the two she had. \"My work can't bring back my girls,\" she says, \"but it can make sure they didn't die in vain. I feel their deaths have achieved so much.\" </p> <p>For more information, call the Obstetric Cholestasis Support Group on: 0121-353 0699</p>",

It's not a wonder slimming drug or a new tantric meditation technique, but a relatively straightforward and relatively new laser treatment to correct short sight. A gaggle of celebs are queueing up to rave about Lasik laser surgery, each in terms more breathless than the last. \"It's a miracle, I feel I've been given a new life,\" Cox says. Before she had the surgery, she could not read cue cards or an autoprompt, and even had difficulty telling her Friends co-stars Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston apart (one is blonde, the other a brunette). Cox's eyesight was so bad that she qualified as legally blind. Now, she says, \"every day is a new experience of vibrant images\". </p> <p>It may sound too good to be true, but Lasik surgery (Lasik stands for \"laser in situ kertatomileusis\") does promise something little short of miraculous. An almost entirely painless technique to correct chronically poor eyesight, with immediate improvement in vision, the technique takes only 10 minutes for each eye. You can even have it done the day you walk into a surgery, so long as you have \u00a33,000 in your pocket. </p> <p>Tempted by a while-you-wait one-stop eyesight shop, 12,000 myopic patients in the UK and close to 1m in the US are signing up for it each year. It's now the most common form of elective surgery in America and accounts for 90% of all laser eye operations each year in this country. \"People walk into a surgery and 20 minutes later they throw away their glasses,\" says a spokesman for the Moorfields eye hospital. </p> <p>It is six years since Lasik treatment was first offered in the UK and five years since it was licensed in the US, but the long-term safety of the procedure is far from proven. In 1998 the Home Office suggested that police forces reject any candidates who had undergone any form of laser eye surgery as its efficacy was unproven. Now some eye experts are questioning its safety, in particular whether it can lead to long-term vision deterioration or even disintegration of the eyeballs. </p> <p>The procedure, in which the surgeon lifts a sliver of the cornea with a knife, removes some tissue beneath it with a laser and replaces the sliver, is known as \"flap and zap\" because of its supposed speed and ease. But, warn experts, if the surgery goes awry it can lead to the cornea bulging, or parts of it becoming dislodged. In extreme cases some patients may even need a complete corneal transplant. </p> <p>John Marshall, professor of ophthalmology at St Thomas's hospital in London and the country's leading expert on laser eye surgery, has this week expressed reservations about the long-term safety of the Lasik technique. He was involved in the development of Lasik's more conservative predecessor, the photo-refractive keratectomy (PRK) treatment, in which microscopic amounts of tis sue are removed from the surface of the cornea with an ultraviolet beam of light. It can take some months for the eyes to heal, during which time there can be some pain and clouding. </p> <p>\"If you are offered two types of surgery, one of which is painless, the other of which involves some pain, there is virtually no doubt that you will go for the former,\" says Marshall. \"If I said in the second operation I will remove less than 5% of the wall of your eye, whereas in the other I'll cut into a third of your eyeball, you might think again. And if I said that in the case of PRK I have 10 years of follow-up data, but in the second I don't know if it will be stable, your decision might be very different. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying that one is bad and the other isn't. It is just that Lasik is a much more aggressive procedure and we don't have a lot of information about the long-term effects.\" </p> <p>Certainly Lasik treatment galloped into use in the US, passed by the Food and Drug Administration after only two years. Marshall says he is concerned \"because before doing such huge numbers it would have been nice to have had more long-term follow-up.\" </p> <p>Those worried about the potential scale of the problem should look to the US, where a support group called Surgical Eyes exists for people whose laser treatment has gone wrong. Executive director Ron Link says it is difficult to measure the scale of the problem, but that he knows of 1,000 people who have suffered long-term eye damage, with another 4,000 potential cases waiting to be assessed. </p> <p>I'm not saying that Lasik is a bad procedure, but it is not being used appropriately,\" he says. \"Secondly, people do not realise that if they have a bad result, there is no Plan B. The impression is that you can go back into glasses and contact lenses, and nothing is further from the truth.\" If the surgery goes wrong, you may need reconstructive surgery - or end up almost blind. </p> <p>Marshall agrees that the key is being as informed as possible before paying for surgery. The treatment is not appropriate, for instance, for those with vision worse than -12 diaopters (extreme short sight). If a private clinic tells you otherwise, be suspicious, and walk away if they offer to do the procedure on the same day as the first consultation. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists publishes guidelines for practitioners and potential patients. The only way the latter will know whether their surgeon follows these guidelines, says a spokeswoman, is to make sure they are well-informed themselves. </p> <p>\"The fact remains that with a 95% success rate, this procedure has one of the highest success rates of any operation,\" says Marshall. It is just that when it goes wrong, it goes very wrong - and no one knows the real risks. \"I'm not saying that it is going to ruin your eyes, but I just want people to be aware that there are potential risks. You have no idea of what will happen in four or five years' time.\"</p>",

Why is it that in Britain there is such a strong anti-scientific bias, especially among opinion formers and commentators? Why do most people feel unsure that they could accurately judge the merits of the use of scientific knowledge but easily fall prey to scare-mongering about GM food? The reasons are many and some are easy to identify - the paucity of scientific training among Britain's politicians, mandarins and media gurus, the English upper-class loathing of getting one's hands dirty, and our awful school science education. </p> <p>This fear and loathing of science, engineering and technology, damages both British society and our chances of meeting the challenges ahead. \"Northern chemists\" are sneered at by the Oxbridge literateurs and in the City greed and gambling for short-term gain have edged out prudent, long-term investment in research and development. British commerce and industry spend only \u00a3130 per head of population on research and development, whereas in the United States it is six times as much. The only truly vibrant research-led British industry is the pharmaceutical industry (the developing electronics industry of the 70s having been effectively killed by Tories), but even this is under great threat. </p> <p>Jan Leschly and Richard Sykes, bosses of soon to be merged SmithKline Beecham/Glaxo Wellcome, recently told the House of Commons science and technology committee that Britain is in danger of becoming a poor place to run a science-based industry. This is partly because of public hostility, but also because of the lack of government investment in science and technology in universities, which is now only 85% of what it was in 1995. Leschly and Sykes's veiled threat is probably serious. In the 70s the hysterical reactions of green activists against the bio-manufacture of medicines forced German pharmaceutical companies to relocate manufacturing and R&amp;D in Ireland and the US. Germany is only now catching up. </p> <p>What can be done about the current situation? Of course scientists must bear some responsibility. We must engage and be open minded, and eschew the arrogance we so often hide behind. We must be careful to prove that while being pro-science we are against its misuse - where it can be genuinely shown. But we must also stand up for ourselves and our community in stop ping the headlong rush towards unreason. Wherever possible, working scientists should point out the difference between hazard (a potential for harm) and risk (the actual probability of harm occurring); the inability to see this difference is probably the single biggest difficulty non-specialists have in deciding whether a science-related development is good or bad. Science, in any case, cannot provide absolute answers: such certainties are ruled out by the scientific method, without which we would still believe that the sun went round the earth. </p> <p>Journalists will also have to learn these inescapable truths. I find it immensely ironic that after amplifying all the self-righteous guff from GM food campaigners concerning the so-called precautionary principle, the media were immensely frustrated by Bill Stewart's report on the safety of mobile phones. He and his committee refused absolutely to proscribe the use of mobile phones for children but instead pointed out that there was an identifiable hazard to people whose nervous systems were still developing and that more research should be carried out to determine the risk. It might be messy but the universe is like that. </p> <p>However, the major task facing society in respect of public understanding of science is the problem of science education in schools. Ideally we should educate children to understand that by and large science works - it produces reliable knowledge capable of proving, for example, that Halley's comet will reappear periodically or that certain patterns of DNA can only have come from a particular criminal suspect. More importantly, however, we should teach children how to weigh evidence and how to identify plausible but meaningless propositions (such as that evolution is \"only\" a theory). At the moment consideration of what science is, what it can do and the limits of its usefulness are crowded out of the school curriculum by an over-emphasis on facts. </p> <p>Considering that only a small proportion of the population ever needs to use these facts, attempting to force them into the brains of unwilling recipients has caused wholesale rejection. Hence science education must be reformed so that by 16, our children have sufficient understanding of the way science works, the reliability of its findings and the relevance and applicability to our lives, so that they can make informed and sensible decisions about what they want. </p> <p>Only those school students who have a particular scientific bent should be helped to acquire the detailed scientific knowledge needed prior to advanced study at universities. Unless we do this, we will have a population which is effectively disenfranchised due to a lack of adequate decision-making tools; worse, it will be open to be manipulated by sectional interests, whether of the religious right, the eco-fascists or the stockmarket wide boys. </p> <p>Michael J Rennie is Symers professor of physiology at Dundee University. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

I find it immensely ironic that after amplifying all the self-righteous guff from GM food campaigners concerning the so-called precautionary principle, the media were immensely frustrated by Bill Stewart's report on the safety of mobile phones. He and his committee refused absolutely to proscribe the use of mobile phones for children but instead pointed out that there was an identifiable hazard to people whose nervous systems were still developing and that more research should be carried out to determine the risk. It might be messy but the universe is like that. However, the major task facing society in respect of public understanding of science is the problem of science education in schools. Ideally we should educate children to understand that by and large science works - it produces reliable knowledge capable of proving, for example, that Halley's comet will reappear periodically or that certain patterns of DNA can only have come from a particular criminal suspect. More importantly, however, we should teach children how to weigh evidence and how to identify plausible but meaningless propositions (such as that evolution is \"only\" a theory). At the moment consideration of what science is, what it can do and the limits of its usefulness are crowded out of the school curriculum by an over-emphasis on facts. Considering that only a small proportion of the population ever needs to use these facts, attempting to force them into the brains of unwilling recipients has caused wholesale rejection. Hence science education must be reformed so that by 16, our children have sufficient understanding of the way science works, the reliability of its findings and the relevance and applicability to our lives, so that they can make informed and sensible decisions about what they want. Only those school students who have a particular scientific bent should be helped to acquire the detailed scientific knowledge needed prior to advanced study at universities. Unless we do this, we will have a population which is effectively disenfranchised due to a lack of adequate decision-making tools; worse, it will be open to be manipulated by sectional interests, whether of the religious right, the eco-fascists or the stockmarket wide boys.

      "byline": "William Hague",

      "body": "<p> \"Today I have come to Archbishop Tenison's School, to see for myself what good teaching and excellent school leadership can do to bring excellence in education to pupils in one of the more deprived areas of our capital. </p> <p>\"Archbishop Tenison's was for many years a monument to the absolute failure of a liberal establishment and its dogmatic ideas. A former grammar school and centre of excellence, it was forced to become a comprehensive under Harold Wilson's government. Its sixth form then withered away and, under the rule of the loony left in Lambeth, it became what some people would have described as an inner city sink school. </p> <p>\"Then, in 1993, under the leadership of headmaster Brian Jones, it opted out of local authority control and became grant-maintained. A couple of years later, it got back its sixth form. Since then it has gone from strength to strength. According to the HM Chief Inspector of Schools, it is one of the 29 most improved schools in the country. It is heavily over-subscribed, has earned much confidence within the local community and even has three ex-pupils playing in the Premier League. Last year, twenty four of its pupils gained places at university including one pupil who won a place at Cambridge university. </p> <p>\"Ignorant chancellors of the exchequer who lecture our best universities about elitism should come to inner city comprehensives like this one to find out what a liberal elite did to destroy standards in our schools. And they should learn from schools like Archbishop Tenison's about the dramatic improvements can happen when schools are freed from bureaucratic controls and left wing political interference. </p> <p>\"For the real enemy of good education in Britain is the elitism of a New Labour government increasingly in thrall to the obsessions of the liberal establishment. </p> <p>\"New Labour and its liberal elite have abolished the Assisted Places Scheme that helped children from less well off backgrounds go to some of the best schools in the country because of their ideological hatred of private education. </p> <p>\"New Labour and its liberal elite have scrapped grant maintained schools - the very mechanism that rescued schools like Archbishop Tenison's and hundreds of others from the clutches of politically motivated local education authorities. </p> <p>\"New Labour and its liberal elite have unleashed Labour party activists in a war against our excellent grammar schools, that only the good sense of parents has stopped becoming a national tragedy. </p> <p>\"Now New Labour and its liberal elite are trying to force feed our nation's school children with their politically correct nonsense by seeking to abolish important safeguards like Section 28. And the latest news is that they even want to ban musical chairs because it is unfair to the child without a chair when the music stops. </p> <p>\"For decades we have had to put up with the classroom obsessions of the Labour party and the liberal elite. And we have paid the price in our schools with falling standards, poor discipline and children who can't spell the word 'Oxford' let alone aspire to go there. </p> <p>\"Is it any wonder that the percentage of students at Oxford and Cambridge who went to state schools has dropped considerably since the liberal establishment got hold of our education policy in the 1960s? </p> <p>\"The last Conservative government succeeded in turning the liberal tide with grant maintained schools, city technology colleges and the national curriculum. But we did not go far enough, and we were hampered in our efforts by left-wing local education authorities. </p> <p>\"The next Conservative government will not just turn the tide - we will defeat the liberal elite that has brought our education system to its knees. </p> <p>\"In the next few weeks, I will be setting out our education policy in a whole range of areas. Today I want to start by telling you about how my party is going make discipline in our schools a key plank of our education policy for the next general election. </p> <p>\"I want to tell you about how we are going to give teachers the backing they deserve, and head-teachers the freedom they need, to deal with unruly pupils. </p> <p>\"I want to tell you about how the next Conservative government is going to put the right of the many to a decent and ordered education before the rights of the disruptive and violent few. </p> <p>\"Sadly, that is not the case today. For this government has put the interests of the small minority of children with behaviour problems first, and the interests of the great majority of teachers and parents and well-behaved pupils a distant second. </p> <p>\"David Blunkett has set schools the completely arbitrary and unacceptable target of cutting the number of expulsions or - to use the current jargon - the number of permanent exclusions by a third over the next two years. And to make sure his targets are met, the education secretary is fining schools up to \u00a36,000 for every disruptive pupil beyond the targets set by civil servants in Whitehall. </p> <p>\"In short, four thousand more young thugs, are going to be allowed to hold our classrooms to ransom just to satisfy the politically correct targets of this Labour government. </p> <p>\"To education ministers who will no doubt say that this is not a very important issue in our schools, I say: </p> <p>\"Listen to the story of two London secondary schools which last month were forced to re-admit pupils they had permanently excluded for wielding knives and conducting gang-like vendettas. 'Now', say the headteachers, 'all the other pupils are desperately frightened' and the education of hundreds of children has been jeopardised for the sake of a tiny minority. </p> <p>\"Or listen to the story of Angeles Walford, a head-teacher seconded to a failing school, who said recently: 'I excluded a boy who hit a teacher but was forced to give him a second chance. He came back and hit another teacher'. </p> <p>\"Or listen to David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers who spoke for all teachers when he said last week 'the fact is that in order to meet the government's target, more and more intolerable behaviour will have to be tolerated in schools... It seems to me that the interests of the violent, drug dealing and bullying few are increasingly given precedence over the interests of the quiet, law-abiding many'. </p> <p>\"The latest government gimmick that is supposed to be an answer these problems is the 'sin bin'. Like most education initiatives from New Labour, they obviously spent more time thinking up the name than in devising the policy. For David Blunkett's idea is that difficult pupils will be put in special classes within the very schools where they are being disruptive. As anyone with any experience of working in a school could have told him, all that is going to happen is that the problem is moved from the classroom to the playground and classroom corridor. </p> <p>\"I agree with Nigel de Gruchy who attacked what he called the government's 'softly softly approach' by pointing out that 'we are trying to get the message across to youngsters that violent and disruptive behaviour is totally unacceptable anywhere near schools, and that they must go elsewhere. That message is not achieved when \"elsewhere\" is just across the corridor or down the playground'. </p> <p>\"David Blunkett's policy on school discipline is a slap in the face to every teacher and parent in the country who want government to be on their side; it is a blow to law-abiding people across the country who hope and expect that schools teach children in our society about respect for authority and for the law; and it is a denial of the basic right of every school child to get the best education possible in a classroom environment where they are both free to learn and free from intimidation. </p> <p>\"Where this Labour government has failed, the next Conservative government will succeed. We offer a common sense approach that puts the rights of the many ahead of the problems of the few. This is what we will do: </p> <p>\"One, we will abolish Labour's artificial targets for school exclusions that are tying the hands of teachers, and forcing schools to keep disruptive or violent pupils. </p> <p>\"Two, we will abolish the absurd financial penalties that are used by the government to bully schools into meeting those targets. Schools will no longer face the stiff fines for excluding pupils. Good school discipline will no longer mean a heavy blow to school budgets. </p> <p>\"Three, we will give head-teachers and school governors the complete freedom, within the law, to set the standards and rules of discipline in their classrooms. That is what our Free Schools policy is all about - trusting teachers instead of issuing diktats from Whitehall. </p> <p>\"Four, we will help pupils with behavioural problems. There is absolutely no point excluding disruptive children from schools if you are unable to provide them with support. Or else, as we all know to our cost, today's child terrorising a class room becomes tomorrow's youth criminal terrorising a whole community. </p> <p>\"So we will draw on the pioneering work of the Zacchaeus Centre in Birmingham that has achieved remarkable results with difficult and disruptive children. We will establish a network of centres - what we shall call Progress Centres - that will provide everything from a one week's special teaching for a child at risk of being excluded to full-time education for those pupils who are permanently excluded. </p> <p>\"These Progress Centres could be financed either by schools buying a course for a disruptive pupil; or, in the case of permanent exclusions, the Centre being paid the funds that would otherwise have gone to the school. We will also abolish the government's ineffective and gimmicky on site school 'sin bins' and use part of the money saved to help fund the work of the Progress Centres. </p> <p>\"Abolishing the government's school exclusion targets and penalties. Giving schools the freedom to set their own standards of discipline. Helping excluded pupils and schools alike by replacing the gimmick of sin bins with Progress Centres. \"With common sense on school discipline we will give teachers the backing they deserve and children the ordered education that should be theirs by right. </p> <p>\"With common sense on school discipline we will start winning the battle in our classrooms against New Labour and its liberal elite. </p> <p>\"Today, the Conservative party is broadening its agenda and speaking up for the mainstream majority of the British people not just on tax and Europe and crime, but on pensions and now education too. We are coming forward with new ideas and challenging old orthodoxies. </p> <p>\"The contrast with the Labour government is clear. They are running out of ideas and running out of steam. Tomorrow we are told that Tony Blair is going to give another speech that tries to tell us all where his government is going.

      "bodyText": "\"Today I have come to Archbishop Tenison's School, to see for myself what good teaching and excellent school leadership can do to bring excellence in education to pupils in one of the more deprived areas of our capital. \"Archbishop Tenison's was for many years a monument to the absolute failure of a liberal establishment and its dogmatic ideas. A former grammar school and centre of excellence, it was forced to become a comprehensive under Harold Wilson's government. Its sixth form then withered away and, under the rule of the loony left in Lambeth, it became what some people would have described as an inner city sink school. \"Then, in 1993, under the leadership of headmaster Brian Jones, it opted out of local authority control and became grant-maintained. A couple of years later, it got back its sixth form. Since then it has gone from strength to strength. According to the HM Chief Inspector of Schools, it is one of the 29 most improved schools in the country. It is heavily over-subscribed, has earned much confidence within the local community and even has three ex-pupils playing in the Premier League. Last year, twenty four of its pupils gained places at university including one pupil who won a place at Cambridge university. \"Ignorant chancellors of the exchequer who lecture our best universities about elitism should come to inner city comprehensives like this one to find out what a liberal elite did to destroy standards in our schools. And they should learn from schools like Archbishop Tenison's about the dramatic improvements can happen when schools are freed from bureaucratic controls and left wing political interference. \"For the real enemy of good education in Britain is the elitism of a New Labour government increasingly in thrall to the obsessions of the liberal establishment. \"New Labour and its liberal elite have abolished the Assisted Places Scheme that helped children from less well off backgrounds go to some of the best schools in the country because of their ideological hatred of private education. \"New Labour and its liberal elite have scrapped grant maintained schools - the very mechanism that rescued schools like Archbishop Tenison's and hundreds of others from the clutches of politically motivated local education authorities. \"New Labour and its liberal elite have unleashed Labour party activists in a war against our excellent grammar schools, that only the good sense of parents has stopped becoming a national tragedy. \"Now New Labour and its liberal elite are trying to force feed our nation's school children with their politically correct nonsense by seeking to abolish important safeguards like Section 28. And the latest news is that they even want to ban musical chairs because it is unfair to the child without a chair when the music stops. \"For decades we have had to put up with the classroom obsessions of the Labour party and the liberal elite. And we have paid the price in our schools with falling standards, poor discipline and children who can't spell the word 'Oxford' let alone aspire to go there. \"Is it any wonder that the percentage of students at Oxford and Cambridge who went to state schools has dropped considerably since the liberal establishment got hold of our education policy in the 1960s? \"The last Conservative government succeeded in turning the liberal tide with grant maintained schools, city technology colleges and the national curriculum. But we did not go far enough, and we were hampered in our efforts by left-wing local education authorities. \"The next Conservative government will not just turn the tide - we will defeat the liberal elite that has brought our education system to its knees. \"In the next few weeks, I will be setting out our education policy in a whole range of areas. Today I want to start by telling you about how my party is going make discipline in our schools a key plank of our education policy for the next general election. \"I want to tell you about how we are going to give teachers the backing they deserve, and head-teachers the freedom they need, to deal with unruly pupils. \"I want to tell you about how the next Conservative government is going to put the right of the many to a decent and ordered education before the rights of the disruptive and violent few. \"Sadly, that is not the case today. For this government has put the interests of the small minority of children with behaviour problems first, and the interests of the great majority of teachers and parents and well-behaved pupils a distant second. \"David Blunkett has set schools the completely arbitrary and unacceptable target of cutting the number of expulsions or - to use the current jargon - the number of permanent exclusions by a third over the next two years. And to make sure his targets are met, the education secretary is fining schools up to \u00a36,000 for every disruptive pupil beyond the targets set by civil servants in Whitehall. \"In short, four thousand more young thugs, are going to be allowed to hold our classrooms to ransom just to satisfy the politically correct targets of this Labour government. \"To education ministers who will no doubt say that this is not a very important issue in our schools, I say: \"Listen to the story of two London secondary schools which last month were forced to re-admit pupils they had permanently excluded for wielding knives and conducting gang-like vendettas.

Je me pose plein de questions sur mon avenir. J'ai fait des \u00e9tudes de danse classique mais je n'ai pas pu continuer \u00e0 cause de probl\u00e8mes de tune. En faisant la statue, je gagne assez pour vivre, mais c'est pas grand-chose. \u00c0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, je fais de la figuration pour des films, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9 dans plusieurs courts-m\u00e9trages. Mais mon r\u00eave c'est de recommencer \u00e0 danser. C'est vrai qu'\u00e0 Paris il y a beaucoup de gens qui font ce boulot, mais \u00e7a continue \u00e0 \u00e9tonner les passants. Heureusement, sinon j'aurais du mal \u00e0 gagner ma vie. Parfois, les gens ont des r\u00e9actions bizarres - ils vont te regarder pour essayer de te d\u00e9concentrer. L'autre jour, une petite fille est pass\u00e9e avec ses parents. Elle s'est mise \u00e0 pleurer en me voyant. Pour essayer de la calmer, je lui ai fait un clin d'oeil et un petit sourire discret, juste pour elle. C'\u00e9tait magique, elle s'est tout de suite arr\u00eat\u00e9e de pleurer. Je pense qu'on peut faire de vraies rencontres, m\u00eame sans paroles.

But it requires self-confident leadership to do so\".</p> <p>The implications run counter to weekend advice from pro-euro campaigners that Tony Blair should start fighting to change public opinion now with a view to taking sterling into the eurozone as soon as the promised referendum has been won.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Brown insist on a \"wait and see\" policy and public opinion remains hostile. esterday's paper says Mr Brown's five tests have become harder to pass as UK inflation and unemployment falls and Europe's rates do less well.</p> <p>Some ministers are getting restless that delay will damage national interests.</p> <p>But the New Europe paper insists: \"So far we detect no political or economic evidence which suggests that exclusion is harming British interests.\" Last night it attracted a counterblast from another weighty Tory ex-chancellor, Lord Howe, who said: \"The euro-economies are already enjoying the benefit of currency stability in respect of 85% of their trade.

      "bodyText": "The battle over British membership of the European Union's single currency flared again last night after two former chancellors of the exchequer endorsed claims that, far from converging, the UK and EU economies are drifting further apart. The claim came as EU finance ministers (Ecofin) failed to break the deadlock over the controversial withholding tax on savings - guaranteeing renewed conflict between Britain and its allies at the Portugeuse summit in mid-June. A paper published yesterday by the New Europe group, which includes Labour's Lord Healey and the Conservative Lord Lawson, said the UK economy was further than ever from meeting Gordon Brown's five economic tests for euro membership. It said that in contrast to Britain's parlous position 25 years ago, the country is now \"strong enough economically and politically to carve out a distinctive position firmly within the enlarged EU. But it requires self-confident leadership to do so\". The implications run counter to weekend advice from pro-euro campaigners that Tony Blair should start fighting to change public opinion now with a view to taking sterling into the eurozone as soon as the promised referendum has been won. Mr Blair and Mr Brown insist on a \"wait and see\" policy and public opinion remains hostile. esterday's paper says Mr Brown's five tests have become harder to pass as UK inflation and unemployment falls and Europe's rates do less well. Some ministers are getting restless that delay will damage national interests. But the New Europe paper insists: \"So far we detect no political or economic evidence which suggests that exclusion is harming British interests.\" Last night it attracted a counterblast from another weighty Tory ex-chancellor, Lord Howe, who said: \"The euro-economies are already enjoying the benefit of currency stability in respect of 85% of their trade. But for British traders the pound, so far from being under our 'sovereign' control, will remain a punchball currency with its value at the mercy of euro-dollar exchange rate fluctuations.\" Quite separately Brussels was quivering last night at the news that one of Britain's most combative diplomats has been appointed as the ambassador to the EU. Nigel Sheinwald, 47, the Foreign Office's director for the EU, has the reputation of being confident, assertive, and capable of driving through radical change. Mr Sheinwald was spokesman for Robin Cook and Malcolm Rifkind before that. He replaces Sir Stephen Wall, returning to London in the summer to head the European secretariat in the Cabinet Office, which works closely with Downing Street. In Luxembourg yesterday Britain again backed an exchange of information between national tax authorities, a measure countries like Luxembourg claim is incompatible with banking secrecy. The two-year dispute over how to eliminate tax avoidance without introducing a tax that would damage the City will now have to be discussed again on the eve of the EU summit at Santa Maria de Feira in two weeks. \"I'm not so very optimistic about Feira,\" said the Finnish finance minister, Sauli Niinisto. \"Britain is loading the boat to prevent an agreement,\" complained Didier Reynders, the Belgian finance minister. If the issue is not resolved it is likely to cause even greater ructions during the French presidency of the EU, beginning on July 1. But diplomats predicted that it would be extremely difficult to overcome objections by Luxembourg, the EU's smallest member, because of the perceived threat to its thriving international banking centre. Austria and Belgium are also angry because Britain will only agree to exchange information on a reciprocal basis, and not with countries that opt for a withholding tax to preserve their banking secrecy. Britain also faces opposition to its demand for the proposed EU directive to set a firm time limit on the retention of banking secrecy within the EU. \u0095 Some encouragement for Mr Blair's long-term hope of euro entry came last night in a poll for ITN which showed that 50% of the British public think the UK should join the euro either as soon as possible or as soon as conditions are right. Only 45% of those polled think joining the single currency should be ruled out for all time, or for the next few years.",

The coming referendum on the euro was seen in 1996, when the Major government promised it over the fuming resistance of Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine, as a terrible defeat for those who favoured more integration. As in 1975, the fear and loathing were all on the pro-Europe side. Now, with 2002 as the likely date for another test, the scene is extraordinarily different.</p> <p>Those who do not want a referendum are all on the Eurosceptic side. They do not, of course, oppose referendums in principle, though Michael Portillo lined up with Clarke and Heseltine in 1996. Nor have they moderated their hostility to the euro. If entry were contemplated without a referendum, they would choke on the foam of their own outrage. But they don't want this one to take place. Preventing it is a key part of their strategy. Just about their entire game-plan is so to magnify the certainty of their own victory as to intimidate the government from putting the question to the test.</p> <p>This tactic has had some success. The referendum seems to have receded from the realm of fixed expectations. The pound-euro exchange rate could be said to make the issue academic. The domestic economy is doing well enough to suggest there are few costs in exclusion from the single cur rency, and public opinion evidently makes clear the risk any referendum would bring to the government that proposed it. Most of the media, as intimidators-in-chief, are complicit in the strategy, and have strong influence on making it work. In the perfect world of almost all anti-euro opinion, the referendum will be postponed for ever.</p> <p>How can this be, when they're so convinced of their case that they should surely welcome popular proof that they have won it? Their reasons for hesitation, though seldom admitted, are revealing. One exposes a chink in their certainty. They know that a referendum, once called, could not be guaranteed to underwrite their claims about public opinion: ie, they're terrified of losing. They naturally prefer to keep that possibility locked and unexamined in the closet, a risk avoided not confronted.</p> <p>Secondly, some are conscious of what the referendum could yield. They worry about winning almost as much as losing. For a \"no\" vote would have consequences beyond the euro. The campaign would, without a doubt, have been about Britain's entire European identity. The nation would have declared, in a strong sense, against further integration of any kind. Such a vote would be but the prelude to marginalisation of this country away from a central EU role. That would be an existential decision of the profoundest magnitude, bringing pleasure to the few people who honestly desire Britain to leave Europe, but consternation to the larger number of sceptics who, while willing this means of exit, would be horrified when confronted with the end they had recklessly brought about.</p> <p>No wonder, therefore, that the parents of the referendum are now anxious to abort it. As it looms, they privately quail before the twin discomforts. But this doesn't mean the referendum has no friends. On the contrary, the pro-Europeans now want it very badly. Role-reversal is complete. Those who want a public consultation are all on the other side. The friends of the referendum are the friends of Europe. All they lack is the voice to shout about it - and the confidence they should take from this telling desire of their enemies to avoid the final battle.</p> <p>Tony Blair is inexorably moving that way, after some interim wobbles. The economics must still stack up, he tells visitors. He can't be certain that they will. Obviously if the currency loses a member, all bets are off. Convergence between the pound and the euro needs to have proceeded for some time. But the bias towards entry has renewed its tilt, assisted by the visibly harsh consequences of the high pound for manufacturing jobs, and likely to be further assisted by manifest instability when the pound starts going down faster than the Bank and Treasury would ever want. Mr Blair is already preparing for the referendum which his side once regarded as anathema.</p> <p>How he's going about it is a matter of debate. There are arguments about whether he should do more to make the case before the election. For my part, I think the statement of a desired timetable would do most to reassure markets and investors that the government was no longer uncertain of its purpose, while holding its hand on a final decision. Hanging over too large a portion of the scene is the shadow of the chancellor, who opposes such committing clarity, and appears to revel in the speculation caused by his apparent indecision. Is he a closet sceptic? Why does he disdain other finance ministers? What's his game? Even Number 10 asks the questions.</p> <p>But the pressure from the other side is beginning to gather, with a new force. When ministers such as Stephen Byers, and especially Peter Mandelson, make a public case against the status quo, Mr Brown may be furious but Mr Blair is quietly pleased. They show the downside of being out of the euro. This is likely to go on, even if the prime minister himself chooses not to press the point. He has his proxies. Trade unions will soon start piling in. The figures on inward investment may go on looking rosy, but there are potent cases the other way, and anyway everyone knows this is a trend-line where the lags are long. A critical mass, composed of events and words, is building.</p> <p>Whether the referendum is held depends now, in my opinion, on only one unknown: the size of Labour's majority at the election. Below a certain level, it may be unholdable. Above 80-100, the intimidatory power of those who want to stop the test being made will be swept aside. The parallels with 1975, when the government carried the yes vote home by 2-1, may not all be so apt as Bob Worcester makes them sound in his new pamphlet (How to win the Euro Referendum: lessons of 1975, Foreign Policy Centre). But his contention that the outcome depends on Blair's image as a credible leader more than on the minutiae of popular attitudes to the currency, or even sovereignty, will rightly encourage the leader to take the plunge.</p> <p>In doing so, he will run a risk. But it has to be run. It means exposing those very existential questions that the eurosceptics fear to face. It would be a clarifying process. For better or worse, the referendum is a pledge - let it be for the better. Desired by one side, rejected or fended off or schemed against by the other, it will expose which is the side of democratic virtue. There are those so sure of their own case that they couldn't believe Mr Blair would dare hold it.

On top of this, he has to deal with latent alcoholism, his daughter (Annabel Gish) and his wife's divorcee sister (Ellen Barkin) adding pressure to the already spatially and financially stretched environment. Good performances from all of the leads, but an excess of issues finds the film unable to hold together all of its elements. (WH) Bram Stoker's Dracula (Francis Ford Coppola, 1992) 10pm, FilmFour Coppola reads the great gothic tale as a grand amour: in the blood-weltered middle ages, Gary Oldman's grieving Dracula (pictured) condemns himself to the undead when his woman dies; he exists in torment for centuries until, in London, he discovers her living image in Winona Ryder. Anthony Hopkins plays Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves the foolish Jonathan Harker.

Most of the models are owned by the majority of twenty-something whizz kids who make up Psygnosis's 220 staff. </p> <p>\"Our staff are quite well paid compared to the average Joe out there,\" said John Bickley, general manager at Psygnosis. \"They have a disposable income and we have helped play a small part in the rejuvenation of the Liverpool economy which is definitely on the up. It's almost literally every month now that new bars and restaurants are opening up, which to me is a significant sign of economic resurgence.\" </p> <p>Life - one of the growing number of trendy bars and restaurants in Bold Street - is one of the popular haunts for both the \"techies\" and the stars of the local soaps, Brookside and Hollyoaks. </p> <p>Meanwhile, penthouses are selling in the dockland renovated loft warehouses for \u00a3500,000. Unlike London, however, you can still buy a three bedroom semi for between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3130,000. A \u00a360m investment has also been announced for five 40-storey buildings along the city's river front. </p> <p>\"Obviously the new technology-related businesses are fast growing and a very important aspect of our regional economy,\" said John Burrows, the North-West Development Agency's business development director. The agency is now fielding 300 inquiries annually from large hi-tech firms, which are considering investing in the area and want to rationalise their European operations. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sony.com\">Sony</a> saw the potential early and bought Psygnosis back in 1993 to support its Playstation business. The local firm's latest big project is updating the Formula One game for the Playstation2 which has already been released in Japan and is expected in the US and UK later this year. </p> <p>Now a queue has formed to follow Sony's Liverpool lead. The French games giant <a href=\"http://www.infogrames.com\">Infogrames</a> has also been drawn in to the hub of creativity and bought another gaming group, <a href=\"http://www.infogrames.co.uk\">Ocean</a>. </p> <p>Another of Europe's largest games developers, <a href=\"http://www.rage.co.uk\">Rage Software</a>, is also based on Merseyside - but has remained independent, with a full listing on the London stock market. </p> <p>The growth of hi-tech business has helped to offset the demise of manufacturing and port industries which drove unemployment in the region to almost 20% in the depths of the recession in the early 1990s. The latest figure is 9.5%. It has also lifted house prices, boosted new restaurants and bars - and left salesmen at glitzy car showrooms rubbing their hands with glee. </p> <p>Almost \u00a31bn in investment finance from the European Development Fund has contributed to Liverpool's economic revival and its increasing attractiveness to business. </p> <p>But Pete Fulwell, who lectures at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts and acts as a digital industry adviser, warned that new funding needed to be spent wisely for the region's success. \"It's the beginning of something really important in the next five years in this area and we've got to get the next round of European Development Funding right. That will see us continue to grow in the next 50 years,\" he said. \"Otherwise we will carry on the old depression and fault lines.\" </p> <p>While the north-west doesn't have London or Heathrow on its doorstop to lure the likes of Microsoft, the half-hour drive to Manchester's international airport is almost as adequate, says Burrows. </p> <p>The argument of a better quality of life goes a long way with many of the companies which have decided to locate in Liverpool and the surrounding area. Housing is cheaper than in the south-east, commuting is easy and there is a thriving cultural scene. And of course Liverpool is one of the few British cities apart from London with what amounts to a world brand. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amaze.co.uk\">Amaze</a>, an internet company that emerged from Liverpool University and which now employs 125 people, does not consider its location a disadvantage. Stuart Melhuish, chief executive of the web design and software company, admits Liverpool can be a difficult location for long-distance travel. </p> <p>But he adds: \"We are in the e-business, location isn't necessarily an issue. The reality is with our client handling skills we can work with customers remotely.\" It boasts clients such as pharmaceutical group Warner Lambert, Saatchi and Saatchi and Volkswagen. </p> <p>Melhuish said a lot of Amaze's employees were graduates - and the company relied on the surrounding universities, which he listed as a major plus for the region. \"Creativity is definitely one of the region's strengths,\" he said. \"Finding a way to ensure that talent pool stays in the north-west is the difficult thing.\" </p> <p>The region has to entice more government and venture capital funding into the area - and ensure that support is provided for local entrepreneurial flair. </p> <p>One example of how the area can be bypassed was provided by <a href=\"http://www.bt.com\">BT</a>. The initial roll-out of <a href=\"http://www.adsl.com\">ADSL</a> - the new technology that provides high-speed internet access using ordinary telephone lines - did not include Liverpool, even though it could be crucial to many local hi-tech firms. </p> <p>But many of the e-businesses in the city are serving world markets, rather than just the UK, says Melhuish: \"Liverpool has a much greater chance of success in Europe than it does within the UK ... there are a lot of cities like Liverpool across Europe that are trying to produce sustainable economies.\" </p> <p>Even so, the area is still competing with centres like Cambridge and the south-east which have attracted large foreign investment and become powerful economic regions. The clusters of new businesses in Liverpool are small by comparison and need commitment and continued government backing to achieve anywhere near the growth of their counterparts in the south.</p>",

There's a Porche Boxster, a dozen BMWs. various4WD's and a scattering of MX5 coup\u00e9s. Most of the models are owned by the majority of twenty-something whizz kids who make up Psygnosis's 220 staff. \"Our staff are quite well paid compared to the average Joe out there,\" said John Bickley, general manager at Psygnosis. \"They have a disposable income and we have helped play a small part in the rejuvenation of the Liverpool economy which is definitely on the up. It's almost literally every month now that new bars and restaurants are opening up, which to me is a significant sign of economic resurgence.\" Life - one of the growing number of trendy bars and restaurants in Bold Street - is one of the popular haunts for both the \"techies\" and the stars of the local soaps, Brookside and Hollyoaks. Meanwhile, penthouses are selling in the dockland renovated loft warehouses for \u00a3500,000. Unlike London, however, you can still buy a three bedroom semi for between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3130,000. A \u00a360m investment has also been announced for five 40-storey buildings along the city's river front. \"Obviously the new technology-related businesses are fast growing and a very important aspect of our regional economy,\" said John Burrows, the North-West Development Agency's business development director. The agency is now fielding 300 inquiries annually from large hi-tech firms, which are considering investing in the area and want to rationalise their European operations. Sony saw the potential early and bought Psygnosis back in 1993 to support its Playstation business. The local firm's latest big project is updating the Formula One game for the Playstation2 which has already been released in Japan and is expected in the US and UK later this year. Now a queue has formed to follow Sony's Liverpool lead. The French games giant Infogrames has also been drawn in to the hub of creativity and bought another gaming group, Ocean. Another of Europe's largest games developers, Rage Software, is also based on Merseyside - but has remained independent, with a full listing on the London stock market. The growth of hi-tech business has helped to offset the demise of manufacturing and port industries which drove unemployment in the region to almost 20% in the depths of the recession in the early 1990s. The latest figure is 9.5%. It has also lifted house prices, boosted new restaurants and bars - and left salesmen at glitzy car showrooms rubbing their hands with glee. Almost \u00a31bn in investment finance from the European Development Fund has contributed to Liverpool's economic revival and its increasing attractiveness to business. But Pete Fulwell, who lectures at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts and acts as a digital industry adviser, warned that new funding needed to be spent wisely for the region's success. \"It's the beginning of something really important in the next five years in this area and we've got to get the next round of European Development Funding right. That will see us continue to grow in the next 50 years,\" he said. \"Otherwise we will carry on the old depression and fault lines.\" While the north-west doesn't have London or Heathrow on its doorstop to lure the likes of Microsoft, the half-hour drive to Manchester's international airport is almost as adequate, says Burrows. The argument of a better quality of life goes a long way with many of the companies which have decided to locate in Liverpool and the surrounding area. Housing is cheaper than in the south-east, commuting is easy and there is a thriving cultural scene. And of course Liverpool is one of the few British cities apart from London with what amounts to a world brand. Amaze, an internet company that emerged from Liverpool University and which now employs 125 people, does not consider its location a disadvantage. Stuart Melhuish, chief executive of the web design and software company, admits Liverpool can be a difficult location for long-distance travel. But he adds: \"We are in the e-business, location isn't necessarily an issue. The reality is with our client handling skills we can work with customers remotely.\" It boasts clients such as pharmaceutical group Warner Lambert, Saatchi and Saatchi and Volkswagen. Melhuish said a lot of Amaze's employees were graduates - and the company relied on the surrounding universities, which he listed as a major plus for the region. \"Creativity is definitely one of the region's strengths,\" he said. \"Finding a way to ensure that talent pool stays in the north-west is the difficult thing.\" The region has to entice more government and venture capital funding into the area - and ensure that support is provided for local entrepreneurial flair. One example of how the area can be bypassed was provided by BT. The initial roll-out of ADSL - the new technology that provides high-speed internet access using ordinary telephone lines - did not include Liverpool, even though it could be crucial to many local hi-tech firms. But many of the e-businesses in the city are serving world markets, rather than just the UK, says Melhuish: \"Liverpool has a much greater chance of success in Europe than it does within the UK ... there are a lot of cities like Liverpool across Europe that are trying to produce sustainable economies.\" Even so, the area is still competing with centres like Cambridge and the south-east which have attracted large foreign investment and become powerful economic regions. The clusters of new businesses in Liverpool are small by comparison and need commitment and continued government backing to achieve anywhere near the growth of their counterparts in the south.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.carlton.com\">Carlton Communications</a> chairman Michael Green said yesterday that the ITV companies needed to extract further value from their collective brand name and develop the <a href=\"http://www.itv.co.uk\">itv.co.uk</a> website. </p> <p>He conceded that the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com\">BBC</a> had stolen a lead in this area by developing a seamless transition between its free-to-air radio and television programming and its internet offering. </p> <p>Mr Green said that the ITV website would gain much of its strength through closer relationships with the pay-television group <a href=\"http://www.ondigital.com\">ONdigital</a>. At present, ONdigital - jointly owned by Carlton and <a href=\"http://www.granada.co.uk\">Granada</a> - provides e-mail only, but the launch of full internet access is imminent. </p> <p>The other way of strengthening and capitalising on ITV.com as a \"huge asset\" would be through consolidation among the ITV franchises, Mr Green said at the <a href=\"http://www.merilllynch.com\">Merill Lynch</a> technology, media and telecoms conference in London. </p> <p>Carlton is merging with <a href=\"http://www.unm.com\">United News &amp; Media</a> in a move that will streamline the ITV industry and also strengthen their clout in the fight for advertising revenue. The advertising revenues of both companies have suffered strong competition from cable, satellite, digital and internet media. </p> <p>As part of the merger both companies are selling off a number of businesses. One of these is <a href=\"http://www.technicolor.com\">Technicolor</a> - the leading video duplicator and cin\u00e9 film processing business owned by Carlton, which has attracted strong interest. It is expected to fetch almost \u00a32bn and at least 10 parties are said to be vying for it. </p> <p>Granada has threatened to spoil the merger with a bid for one or other company but this depends on it gaining regulatory approval. </p> <p>Mr Green refused to speculated on Granada's intentions. </p> <p>\"We believe in the consolidation of ITV,\" Mr Green said. \"This is something that is going to help our industry. However, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what Granada may or may not do.\" </p> <p>He said Carlton was \"still very confident that ONdigital will get a listing\". </p> <p>Analysts have put a value on ONdigital of almost \u00a32bn following the release of figures which showed that it had signed up a total of 673,000 subscribers by the end of March. </p> <p>In another conference presentation, Stuart Prebble, chief executive of ONdigital, said the pay-TV group would continue to fight fiercely to win the rights to Premier League Football. </p> <p>\"The rights market is now far more competitive and open to regulatory scrutiny,\" Mr Prebble said. \"We completely understand what the value of those rights are to our business\", and ONdigital was confident its subscribers would have access to Premier League football. </p> <p>ONdigital is also expected to announce shortly the outcome of negotiations with <a href=\"http://www.bt.com\">BT</a> on the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.adsl.com\">ADSL</a>. </p> <p>This is the new technology that enables high-speed internet access using ordinary telephone cabling. It is now being rolled out by BT - but ONdigital will have to modify its set-top boxes to use the ADSL service rather than a standard analogue connection. </p> <p>\"We do an enormous amount of business with BT,\" Mr Prebble said. \"We are discussing all the opportunities with BT and other players but we are not ready to make an announcement at the moment.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carlton Communications chairman Michael Green said yesterday that the ITV companies needed to extract further value from their collective brand name and develop the itv.co.uk website. He conceded that the BBC had stolen a lead in this area by developing a seamless transition between its free-to-air radio and television programming and its internet offering. Mr Green said that the ITV website would gain much of its strength through closer relationships with the pay-television group ONdigital. At present, ONdigital - jointly owned by Carlton and Granada - provides e-mail only, but the launch of full internet access is imminent. The other way of strengthening and capitalising on ITV.com as a \"huge asset\" would be through consolidation among the ITV franchises, Mr Green said at the Merill Lynch technology, media and telecoms conference in London. Carlton is merging with United News &amp; Media in a move that will streamline the ITV industry and also strengthen their clout in the fight for advertising revenue. The advertising revenues of both companies have suffered strong competition from cable, satellite, digital and internet media. As part of the merger both companies are selling off a number of businesses. One of these is Technicolor - the leading video duplicator and cin\u00e9 film processing business owned by Carlton, which has attracted strong interest. It is expected to fetch almost \u00a32bn and at least 10 parties are said to be vying for it. Granada has threatened to spoil the merger with a bid for one or other company but this depends on it gaining regulatory approval. Mr Green refused to speculated on Granada's intentions. \"We believe in the consolidation of ITV,\" Mr Green said. \"This is something that is going to help our industry. However, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what Granada may or may not do.\" He said Carlton was \"still very confident that ONdigital will get a listing\". Analysts have put a value on ONdigital of almost \u00a32bn following the release of figures which showed that it had signed up a total of 673,000 subscribers by the end of March. In another conference presentation, Stuart Prebble, chief executive of ONdigital, said the pay-TV group would continue to fight fiercely to win the rights to Premier League Football. \"The rights market is now far more competitive and open to regulatory scrutiny,\" Mr Prebble said. \"We completely understand what the value of those rights are to our business\", and ONdigital was confident its subscribers would have access to Premier League football. ONdigital is also expected to announce shortly the outcome of negotiations with BT on the introduction of ADSL. This is the new technology that enables high-speed internet access using ordinary telephone cabling. It is now being rolled out by BT - but ONdigital will have to modify its set-top boxes to use the ADSL service rather than a standard analogue connection. \"We do an enormous amount of business with BT,\" Mr Prebble said. \"We are discussing all the opportunities with BT and other players but we are not ready to make an announcement at the moment.\"",

The 1,400 delegates to the Communication Workers Union's annual conference in Bournemouth voted overwhelmingly against a rise, reflecting growing anger within the union about a string of government policies including threats to sell off part of the post office. Up to \u00a3200,000 more for Labour would have been raised by putting up the political levy from 10p to 12p a week, or from 45p to 55p a month. But Pete Boswell, a Labour member and secretary of the union's Oxfordshire branch, said that would effectively endorse the 75p a week rise in pensions and \u00a31,000 a year university tuition fees. The conference also threatened to withdraw \"financial and moral\" support for Labour if the government privatised part or all of the post office. A number of union leaders have privately warned the prime minister of a backlash in their ranks among traditional Labour supporters. The CWU's leadership had recommended a levy increase and the decisive no vote followed a speech by Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, which was received politely. Derek Hodgson, CWU general secretary, who sits on Labour's national executive committee, complained that delegates had earlier warmly welcomed Mr Byers. \"You gave him a round of applause and the minute he turns his back you say you don't believe him,\" said Mr Hodgson. Mr Byers said: \"We will seek consensus, but no vested interest can have a veto, or stand in the way of policies which are in the national interest. \"Our task, the historic responsibility of the Labour party, is to break down those barriers that deny opportunity and hold people back.\" The Labour party declined to comment on the CWU vote.",

There is a colour picture of Mickey dressed as a morris dancer, with a scarlet sash and red and yellow ribbons on his hat, bizarrely carrying what appear to be two small trees, like a careful dog who doesn't want to be caught short.

Earlier this session the Commons finished with the bill, and sent it off to the Lords, who have just returned it with 675 amendments spread over 91 pages.

      "bodyText": "Labour's heartland areas have been hardest hit by manufacturing job losses since Tony Blair became prime minister, according to a survey identifying a clear north-south divide in the labour market. Figures from the Labour Research Department show that eight out of 10 redundancies which could be linked to particular regions occurred in Scotland or the north of England. The survey traced more than 170,000 redundancies since May 1997. The periods with the highest job losses were in January and March this year. The findings, published yesterday by the trade union-backed research organisation, will add fuel to the claims of some northern Labour MPs that the government is failing to do enough to address the specific needs of heartland communities. Mr Blair has always dismissed talk of a straightforward north-south divide, insisting that variations in unemployment and deprivation within regions were as great as those between them. The survey comes less than two months after MPs on the Commons select committee on education and employment challenged the government's determination to play down the jobs gap. Their report said: \"The benefits of a strong economy have not been shared equally.\" It concluded: \"There is still a distinctive north-south pattern. Unemployment in southern regions, with the exception of London, is still substantially below the average regional level.\" The unemployment rate in the north-east was almost three times the rate in the south-east, said the report entitled, Is there a jobs gap? The committee chairman, Derek Foster, MP for Bishop Auckland, warned at the time: \"In recent months there has been a tendency for ministers to take the view that there are plenty of jobs in all parts of the country. \"We have received a good deal of evidence which refutes that view. Our findings point to the continuing existence of slack labour markets in certain parts of the country ... A failure by the government to recognise this will result in a less sophisticated response to a problem which should concern us all.\" The Labour Research survey, based on 578 redundancy announcements made by manufacturing industry in the past three years, found job losses from a wide range of firms, including new industries such as electronics and biotech com panies, as well as older ones such as steel and textiles. The study concluded: \"Of the 86,607 redundancies which could be allocated to a region (around half of the total), 80% were above the recognised north-south dividing line of the Severn to the Wash.\" Scotland was the hardest-hit region, with 18,275 of the regional job losses, followed by the West Midlands. Paul Convery, director of the Unemployment Unit, sounded a cautious note over the figures, saying that initial redundancy announcements frequently did not translate into real job losses. But he said the Labour Research Department was \"bang on\" over the geographical divide in job losses. \"Manufacturing industry is primarily in the north and in Scotland. Where the jobs are is where the job losses are going to be located.\" The government needed to offer retraining more swiftly to those made jobless from manufacturing, he said.

Their new venture, the Seahorse Group, wants to create a racing brand that would exploit the internet and find economies of scale by combining Redcar with other physical racing facilities. </p> <p>They are aware that future competitors such as Arena Leisure have become hot stocks by successfully combining race course ownership with net-based betting services. Akers made his money through the Sports Internet Group and used to be chairman of Leeds United FC. Zetland is the second largest shareholder in Redcar Racecourse Ltd. </p> <p>The two men are working with Tarek Kassem, a banking adviser with strong Middle East contacts and Akers's sidekick Rodger Sargent, who is on the board of a number of technology companies. </p> <p>Seahorse wants to buy and sell Redcar, near Middlesbrough, and then acquire from Zetland a 537- acre site two miles south of the town. Money would be raised by floating Seahorse on the AIM. </p> <p>Redcar offers 18 race meetings a year between April and November with its most celebrated event being an event for two-year-olds in September with a prize worth up to \u00a3160,000. Zetland says running one-off events in this way is common in racing but makes it difficult to make money as staff have got to be hired specially and then released. </p> <p>He explains: \"We want to provide entertainment 365 days a year and make it a day out for all the family in the way Americans organise their baseball games.\" </p> <p>The organisers are aware that some people might be sceptical about creating a super racecourse close to a traditional northern town. \"But the north of England has always been a centre of racing and road networks are excellent here. Research shows that people will drive two hours - which would take in places such as Liverpool - to have a family day out,\" says Zetland. </p>",

They want to spend anywhere up to \u00a3200m, partly through a stock market listing to turn Redcar from a middle-ranking race course into a recreational centre with theme park, hotels and restaurants. But they are also keen to acquire some of the other nearby courses, such as York, Catterick and Doncaster. Their new venture, the Seahorse Group, wants to create a racing brand that would exploit the internet and find economies of scale by combining Redcar with other physical racing facilities. They are aware that future competitors such as Arena Leisure have become hot stocks by successfully combining race course ownership with net-based betting services. Akers made his money through the Sports Internet Group and used to be chairman of Leeds United FC. Zetland is the second largest shareholder in Redcar Racecourse Ltd. The two men are working with Tarek Kassem, a banking adviser with strong Middle East contacts and Akers's sidekick Rodger Sargent, who is on the board of a number of technology companies. Seahorse wants to buy and sell Redcar, near Middlesbrough, and then acquire from Zetland a 537- acre site two miles south of the town. Money would be raised by floating Seahorse on the AIM. Redcar offers 18 race meetings a year between April and November with its most celebrated event being an event for two-year-olds in September with a prize worth up to \u00a3160,000. Zetland says running one-off events in this way is common in racing but makes it difficult to make money as staff have got to be hired specially and then released. He explains: \"We want to provide entertainment 365 days a year and make it a day out for all the family in the way Americans organise their baseball games.\" The organisers are aware that some people might be sceptical about creating a super racecourse close to a traditional northern town. \"But the north of England has always been a centre of racing and road networks are excellent here. Research shows that people will drive two hours - which would take in places such as Liverpool - to have a family day out,\" says Zetland.",

More than half of the missiles carried by the Royal Navy's Harriers were unserviceable within just two months because of heat and vibration problems, and nearly half of the Harriers depended on spares \"robbed\" from other aircraft, the audit office says. A quarter of all \"precision bombing\" missions by British aircraft had to be aborted due to bad weather.

David Davis, Conservative chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said yesterday that the MoD's failure to manage a \u00a3113m contract to provide hard-walled units left British troops in tents through the cold Balkan winter. \"And they wasted \u00a3228,000 on a hospital project which they approved but then cancelled.\" The audit office also chided the MoD for failing to disclose the true, complete cost of the Kosovo conflict. It says that the additional cost to the taxpayer of operations in Kosovo is estimated to total \u00a3866m over five years. In its report, the MoD says the cost of the first year of the operation has been estimated at \u00a3342m. This figure, however, does not include the cost of replacing ammunition or the 12 unmanned reconnaissance drone aircraft that crashed or were shot down. The MoD points to an authoritative Human Rights Watch report, which estimates that between 488 and 527 Yugoslav civilians were killed during Nato's bombing campaign. It says that from a total of about 10,500 Nato strike sorties, which unleashed 23,600 bombs, less than 1% of all the missions led to unintended fatalities. \"It is not possible to avoid some collateral damage in any significant armed conflict. This fact is recognised by international law,\" the MoD says in its report.

The human rights group also pointed to a number of other attacks, including that on the Grdelica railway bridge, of April 12, on the road bridge in Luzane on May 1, and on the Varvarin bridge on May 30, when Nato forces failed to suspend bombing after it was clear that they had struck civilians.

But I want to extend the hand of friendship to the Protestant and unionist community in this city.\" Mr Crumley was jailed in 1976 and served four years for IRA membership. He was re-arrested in 1982 on the evidence of IRA supergrasses. After two years on remand, he was convicted on charges including conspiracy to murder. He was given nine life sentences, but the convictions were overturned at the court of appeal in 1986. Sinn Fein first won a council seat in Derry in 1985. It now has eight councillors. The SDLP, the largest party with 14 seats, said it was fulfilling a pledge it made to Sinn Fein to back a republican mayor if the IRA ceasefire held. Gregory Campbell, a Democratic Unionist councillor and an assembly member, said: \"Community relations are already poor, but this will make them plumb the depths.\"",

      "bodyText": "Every police force in Britain should have to put in place new emergency procedures to help women who report being forced into marriage by their parents, according to a report to be published this month. The study, the first national examination of the practice said to involve at least 1,000 British Asian women a year, will argue that forced marriage should be put on the same footing as domestic violence and child abuse, stressing that it contravenes women's human rights. However, it will not propose changes in the law, concluding that existing offences such as kidnap, rape and assault are sufficient to curb the practice, provided that police are more aware of its nature. The working party on the issue, chaired by two Labour peers, will recommend a \"trigger mechanism\" for police forces, so that complaints from young people who fear their family is trying to compel them to marry against their will, often in ceremonies abroad, will automatically bring help from social services, the victim's school or college and, where necessary, consular services overseas. At present, according to one working party source, police treatment of the issue, which mainly affects women whose families come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, but also others from some African and Middle Eastern countries, is \"very scant and inconsistent\". The Metropolitan police has established a working group in its racial and violent crime task force, but is now considering creating a separate reporting category for forced marriages to understand the extent of the problem better. The report will also call revision of the procedure for issuing visas for entry to Britain, amid government concern that the vast majority of forced marriage victims end up sponsoring applications for their spouses to settle in the UK. It will propose that the problem of young people being too scared to make formal complaints about such coercion should be addressed. Ministers are concerned that many victims tell entry clearance officers that they have been forced into marriage, with some threatening to kill themselves if the visa is granted, but are unwilling to put anything in writing. The government announced this year that teachers are to be encouraged to go direct to police or social services if they suspect that a female pupil is being forced into marriage - a move endorsed by the report. Teenage magazines, TV soap operas and pop radio stations are urged to carry stories that show Asian girls that a forced marriage is wrong and that they have a right to resist it. The working party, chaired by the Asian peers Baroness Uddin and Lord Ahmed, was set up eight months ago following a high court ruling that parents who took their daughters abroad to marry against their will were guilty of child abduction. It also followed the conviction of a mother and brother for murdering a young Muslim woman who became pregnant from an affair while the man she had been forced to marry was abroad. Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley, raised concerns with home office ministers after Asian women in her West Yorkshire constituency privately called on her to act. Working party members are divided over how far the solution can be left to ethnic minority communities to resolve. Baronness Uddin warned against alienating community leaders, saying: \"We have got to carry the communities with us, or the whole problem will simply go underground.\" But Pragna Patel, of the women's pressure group Southall Black Sisters, said community leaders did not necessarily represent the concerns of women and children. \"Enough is enough - we look to the state to uphold women's rights.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ukraine pledged yesterday that the stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station, where the world's worst nuclear disaster erupted 14 years ago, would be closed down forever by the end of the year. The announcement by President Leonid Kuchma in Kiev in the presence of Bill Clinton crowned the US president's week-long valedictory tour of Europe and concluded seven years of wrangling over the fate of the power station, which spewed clouds of radioactive debris across Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986. \"We will switch Chernobyl off permanently by December 15 this year,\" said Mr Kuchma after the two presidents had toasted the decision with champagne. Mr Clinton said Washington would provide $80m (\u00a350m) to Ukraine to help with the effort to render the disaster site safe and for investment in the moribund Ukrainian energy industry. Most of the money will be spent on repairing or renewing the creaking concrete and steel \"sarcophagus\" which has entombed the stricken reactor since the disaster. Describing the Ukrainian decision as \"a historic announcement\", Mr Clinton said: \"The final reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be shut down and the entire plant closed on December 15.

The vet came to see her and just shook his head and said: 'That is a lamb'.\" Ms Lane added: \"We suspect our Sussex ram because he is a big, tough guy.\" Expert opinion yesterday suggested that a goat-sheep hybrid was unheard of, but not beyond the bounds of possibility. David Noakes, professor of veterinary obstetrics at London University, said: \"It is well known that if you cross goats and sheep you will get fertilisation and the development of an embryo, but invariably the embryo does not survive.\" Agnes Winter, of Liverpool University veterinary school, said it was \"physiologically impossible\" for a goat to give birth to a lamb.",

      "bodyText": "Launching France's biggest constitutional reform for four decades, President Jacques Chirac was due yesterday to propose cutting the seven-year presidential term to five years - a move that not only avoids future power-sharing between right and left, but also improves his chances of winning the next election. In an interview with the two biggest television stations, to be broadcast last night, Mr Chirac was expected to back down from his longstanding opposition to a shorter presidential term and announce an amendment to the constitution that could be put to a referendum as early as October and implemented in 2002. The Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, has long favoured the idea of bringing the presidential and parliamentary terms into line, believing that this would increase the chances of one political grouping - left or right - holding sway in both the parliament and the president's Elys\u00e9e palace. Three times in the last 14 years, including since Mr Chirac's disastrous early election call in 1997, the prime minister and the president have come from opposing sides of the political spectrum, an uncomfortable situation, known as \"cohabitation\", that many French politicians feel weakens the effectiveness of the government. The Gaullist Mr Chirac, a supporter of the strong but relatively hands-off \"imperial presidency\" envisaged by de Gaulle when he laid the foundations of the Fifth Republic in 1958, said a year ago that a five-year term would be \"a mistake\", which he would never support. He has now plainly changed his mind - partly because Mr Jospin has said that if necessary he would bypass the president and use parliament to launch the reform himself, and partly because the president, who is 67, realises that he stands a better chance of being re-elected for five years rather than seven in the next election in 2002. Both men were stung into action by a former rightwing president, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, who last month announced that he would put the reform before parliament if no one else did. Opinion polls have shown that nearly 75% of French voters approve of the plan. While the move is almost certain to obtain the two-thirds majority it needs in both houses of parliament before being put to the public vote, it by no means enjoys the full support of all politicians.

The singing could be heard streets away as the lorry slowly climbed the road leading to Masiaka, the base for the government attack on the rebel Revolutionary United Front.</p> <p>Kamajors, which means \"hunters\" in the Mende language, has come to describe the volunteer self-defence units formed in the southern region during the early years of the war in Sierra Leone.

Later, some moved to the capital, Freetown, often bringing along wives and children.</p> <p>But the growth of the Kamajors - who have been accused of recruiting children and killing prisoners - was also part of the dangerous proliferation of armed groups in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Frank Tabor Bassie, a commander just back from the fighting at Lunsar, 70 miles north-east of Freetown, said that child soldiers with the RUF were often taken prisoner, but that the older rebels resisted to the end. In any case: \"They can't be trusted. The few we have taken say they will reform, but I do not believe they will ever change.\"</p> <p>The young men at Brookfields, a former hotel which acts as the Kamajor base camp in Freetown, did not live up to their fearsome reputation, however. Most were wearing jeans or slacks, with a few in combat fatigues. Baseball caps sent their usual confused messages - Miami Beach, Marlboro, Man United - and all the men had amulets or lucky charms.</p> <p>Sam Hinga Norman, a twinkle-eyed man in his 60s, was prominent in raising some of the first civil defence units when he was a provincial administrator in the early 1990s. He has come to be regarded as the national leader of the Kamajors. He is also the deputy defence minister and was once a professional soldier.</p> <p>Chairing a meeting of what might be called the Kamajor general staff, he ticked off lists of groups on their way to the front, debriefed a returning commander, and pursued the question of getting enough pots and pans to the fighters.</p> <p>Afterwards we crunched through the once pleasant grounds, now metallic with discarded sardine cans, past cooking fires, laundry tubs and a tethered white goat, to examine the supplies.</p> <p>There were stacks of pans, rice, cassava and enamel bowls stencilled with roses. It was all domestic in scale, important in a war conducted in rushes and dashes by relatively small groups of men, and heavily influenced by whether or not stew and rice are available at the end of the day.</p> <p>But the Kamajors take more than rice and ammunition to the battlefield. Famously, they take magical protection against the bullets of the enemy.</p> <p>Momoka Mara, 27, from Pujehun in the east, is one of the corps of \"initiators\" and \"immunisers\" who maintain this magic armour. Baseball capped and T-shirted, swinging his legs over the edge of a table, he did not look like a medicine man. But he explained that when he was younger, he fell in a river and should have drowned, but emerged with special powers. His main tools, he said, were \"herbs, the Koran, and the Holy Bible\".</p> <p>\"You see\", Mr Hinga Norman said in his mellifluous English, \"You call them medicine men, but you have your own armour in western armies and sometimes it does not work, which is the same with us. Sometimes we get hurt and sometimes we get killed, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.\"</p> <p>On one level the initiators carry on social and religious customs that mark the transition to adulthood in rural Sierra Leone in peacetime. On another their function is not dissimilar to that of chaplains in western armies. But they also illustrate that, to Sierra Leoneans, reality includes a spirit world that influences individual and collective life.</p> <p>The outsider has to wonder whether herbs, the Koran, and the Holy Bible are going to be enough. In response, Mr Hinga Norman said simply: that they were \"the three most important things in life\" - and the Kamajor general staff exploded in approval.</p>",

Most were wearing jeans or slacks, with a few in combat fatigues. Baseball caps sent their usual confused messages - Miami Beach, Marlboro, Man United - and all the men had amulets or lucky charms. Sam Hinga Norman, a twinkle-eyed man in his 60s, was prominent in raising some of the first civil defence units when he was a provincial administrator in the early 1990s. He has come to be regarded as the national leader of the Kamajors. He is also the deputy defence minister and was once a professional soldier. Chairing a meeting of what might be called the Kamajor general staff, he ticked off lists of groups on their way to the front, debriefed a returning commander, and pursued the question of getting enough pots and pans to the fighters. Afterwards we crunched through the once pleasant grounds, now metallic with discarded sardine cans, past cooking fires, laundry tubs and a tethered white goat, to examine the supplies. There were stacks of pans, rice, cassava and enamel bowls stencilled with roses. It was all domestic in scale, important in a war conducted in rushes and dashes by relatively small groups of men, and heavily influenced by whether or not stew and rice are available at the end of the day. But the Kamajors take more than rice and ammunition to the battlefield. Famously, they take magical protection against the bullets of the enemy. Momoka Mara, 27, from Pujehun in the east, is one of the corps of \"initiators\" and \"immunisers\" who maintain this magic armour. Baseball capped and T-shirted, swinging his legs over the edge of a table, he did not look like a medicine man. But he explained that when he was younger, he fell in a river and should have drowned, but emerged with special powers. His main tools, he said, were \"herbs, the Koran, and the Holy Bible\". \"You see\", Mr Hinga Norman said in his mellifluous English, \"You call them medicine men, but you have your own armour in western armies and sometimes it does not work, which is the same with us. Sometimes we get hurt and sometimes we get killed, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.\" On one level the initiators carry on social and religious customs that mark the transition to adulthood in rural Sierra Leone in peacetime. On another their function is not dissimilar to that of chaplains in western armies. But they also illustrate that, to Sierra Leoneans, reality includes a spirit world that influences individual and collective life. The outsider has to wonder whether herbs, the Koran, and the Holy Bible are going to be enough. In response, Mr Hinga Norman said simply: that they were \"the three most important things in life\" - and the Kamajor general staff exploded in approval.",

Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs gave George Papandreou a sympathetic hearing when he appeared before the culture, media and sport committee to propose a partnership deal to return the marbles to the Acropolis in time for the 2004 Olympics. The hearing was marred by peremptory comments from Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's secretary, at the Downing Street lobby briefing, announcing that Britain had no intention of returning the treasures which are displayed in the British Museum, in central London. Conservatives MPs boycotted the hearing with Julie Kirkbride, MP for Bromsgrove, claiming that Mr Papandreou's visit was \"superfluous and unnecessary\" since the committee had already been briefed by the Greek foreign ministry when they went to Athens to view the site. She claimed that the culture committee was being used by Pasok (the Greek socialist party) which wanted to be seen fulfilling an election pledge to re-open a dialogue on the marbles. Ms Kirkbride also indicated that she would oppose any move by the select committee to suggest Greece had a moral case for their return. \"As far as I am concerned the marbles were acquired legitimately and the committee has far more important issues to discuss. \"I see no reason why ... the Conservative party which opposed their return for 18 years should change their mind. \" At the hearing Mr Papandreou told the MPs the issue of the 2,500-year-old marbles was \"a very sensitive one and a very important one\" to the people of Greece. \"We are talking about the Parthenon,\" he said. \"We are talking about the greatest national symbol of Greece.

      "body": "<p>The old photograph shows a group of well-dressed men and women on the deck of a ship on the ocean sometime during the Bertie Wooster era. Some look silly. A few are serious. With one exception, who somehow contrives to look both silly and serious, they are all now forgotten faces. But the exception makes the rest of the group important, for he is Arturo Toscanini. </p> <p>\"This is certainly the best- known photograph from the 1930 tour,\" explains Barbara Haws, the archivist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, handling her celebrated print with reverence. Haws is in her busy office in New York's Lincoln Centre, where she is preparing the orchestra's prize exhibits for shipment to London where they are on display this week. </p> <p>\"Here is Toscanini, with the bow tie and the cap,\" she explains as she pores over the picture. \"This is Bruno Labate, the oboist. You know that he talked back to the maestro? Not many people ever did that. But then he had real estate investments in Long Island, so he could afford it if he was fired.\" </p> <p>The New York Philharmonic was founded in 1842, and is altogether more venerable than any arriviste British orchestra, most of which were 20th-century foundations. What's more, when those New Yorkers in the picture took that voyage to make that first European tour in 1930, they came with the man who was then universally regarded as the greatest conductor of that or any other era. </p> <p>\"Ravel came to the concert in Paris,\" says Haws, \"though he thought Toscanini conducted Bolero twice too fast and refused to take a bow with the conductor. In Berlin, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter were in the audience. In Turin, true to his anti-fascist principles, Toscanini and the orchestra defied Mussolini's edict by refusing to play the fascist anthem Giovinezza (a local brass band played it instead). </p> <p>\"And this,\" Haws says, scanning the group photo once more, \"this is Harry Glantz, the trumpet player who took the home movie.\" </p> <p>Harry Glantz's home movies of the tour in 1930 are some of the more unlikely gems of an exhibition that is being mounted at the Barbican Centre to coincide with the orchestra's visit this month. \"It's a very typical home movie. We'll be showing about eight minutes of it, and it has a special quality all of its own. To see Toscanini and the orchestra in playful off-duty ways is a first for most people,\" Haws says. </p> <p>Did any of the players in the photograph play for Mahler, I ask. \"Benjamin Kohon certainly did,\" Haws replies, consulting her identification chart. \"Born 1889. Played with the orchestra from 1908. That would be in Mahler's first season with us.\" </p> <p>If there is one name that resonates across the entire 20th- century history of the NYPO it is not that of Toscanini, or even that of Bernstein, but Gustav Mahler, who spent three years with the orchestra before he returned to Austria to die in 1911.\"This orchestra today is a Mahler orchestra because they have a direct line back to Mahler himself as music director,\" Haws says proudly. \"I just wish we had one of his batons to show.\" </p> <p>What Haws does have, though, and what she now hands me to examine, is Mahler's very own score of his first symphony. On the first page there are two stamped imprints. One says \"New York Philharmonic Orchestra\". The other just says \"Gustav Mahler, Wien\". </p> <p>This precious score is still the orchestra's library copy, so if a conductor wants to use it while working with the orchestra, they can. Not surprisingly, they do. This much handled score is a symphonic icon. It contains markings in the hands of Mahler himself, some made obviously with care at a desk, others so crude they could only have been made in rehearsal. Then there are another batch by his pupil Bruno Walter who conducted the orchestra in the 40s, and still others by Bernstein, greatest of all Mahler's late 20th-century champions. </p> <p> When Bernstein died in 1990, his family bequeathed his 3,500 conducting scores. One that is coming to the Barbican is Bernstein's score of the Mahler's Symphony No 6, on whose opening page the conductor affixed a bumper sticker announcing MAHLER GROOVES. \"You've got to love him, haven't you?\" says Haws. </p> <p>Listen to Haws talking about her orchestra and you soon realise that the most special place in her heart belongs not to any of the famous names who have made the New York Philharmonic what it is, but to the very first conductor long ago, the delightfully named Ureli Corelli Hill, a musicians' musician from Connecticut who conducted the orchestra long before Bernstein ever claimed to be the first American to get the job. </p> <p>Haws hands me another ancient score. There is barely a mark on this one, befitting the Ureli Corelli Hill era, when the conductor simply kept the musicians together. But what a treasure this one is too. </p> <p>\"This is a first edition of the Beethoven fifth, published in Vienna, the first work we ever played in 1842,\" says Haws. \"When I showed it to Masur he said, 'Ah, you know there is a famous misprint in the first edition.' I was so worried that Ureli Corelli might not have known about the misprint, but Masur looked and, yes, they had blocked it out. Oh I was so relieved about that. I was so proud of them. Isn't that a thing to be able to do, to hold a first edition of the Beethoven fifth? Now you see why I became an archivist.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The New York Philharmonic plays at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 4141), on Saturday and Sunday. Items from the orchestra archive will be on display till Sunday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The old photograph shows a group of well-dressed men and women on the deck of a ship on the ocean sometime during the Bertie Wooster era. Some look silly. A few are serious. With one exception, who somehow contrives to look both silly and serious, they are all now forgotten faces. But the exception makes the rest of the group important, for he is Arturo Toscanini. \"This is certainly the best- known photograph from the 1930 tour,\" explains Barbara Haws, the archivist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, handling her celebrated print with reverence. Haws is in her busy office in New York's Lincoln Centre, where she is preparing the orchestra's prize exhibits for shipment to London where they are on display this week. \"Here is Toscanini, with the bow tie and the cap,\" she explains as she pores over the picture. \"This is Bruno Labate, the oboist. You know that he talked back to the maestro? Not many people ever did that. But then he had real estate investments in Long Island, so he could afford it if he was fired.\" The New York Philharmonic was founded in 1842, and is altogether more venerable than any arriviste British orchestra, most of which were 20th-century foundations. What's more, when those New Yorkers in the picture took that voyage to make that first European tour in 1930, they came with the man who was then universally regarded as the greatest conductor of that or any other era. \"Ravel came to the concert in Paris,\" says Haws, \"though he thought Toscanini conducted Bolero twice too fast and refused to take a bow with the conductor. In Berlin, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter were in the audience. In Turin, true to his anti-fascist principles, Toscanini and the orchestra defied Mussolini's edict by refusing to play the fascist anthem Giovinezza (a local brass band played it instead). \"And this,\" Haws says, scanning the group photo once more, \"this is Harry Glantz, the trumpet player who took the home movie.\" Harry Glantz's home movies of the tour in 1930 are some of the more unlikely gems of an exhibition that is being mounted at the Barbican Centre to coincide with the orchestra's visit this month. \"It's a very typical home movie. We'll be showing about eight minutes of it, and it has a special quality all of its own. To see Toscanini and the orchestra in playful off-duty ways is a first for most people,\" Haws says. Did any of the players in the photograph play for Mahler, I ask. \"Benjamin Kohon certainly did,\" Haws replies, consulting her identification chart. \"Born 1889. Played with the orchestra from 1908. That would be in Mahler's first season with us.\" If there is one name that resonates across the entire 20th- century history of the NYPO it is not that of Toscanini, or even that of Bernstein, but Gustav Mahler, who spent three years with the orchestra before he returned to Austria to die in 1911.\"This orchestra today is a Mahler orchestra because they have a direct line back to Mahler himself as music director,\" Haws says proudly. \"I just wish we had one of his batons to show.\" What Haws does have, though, and what she now hands me to examine, is Mahler's very own score of his first symphony. On the first page there are two stamped imprints. One says \"New York Philharmonic Orchestra\". The other just says \"Gustav Mahler, Wien\". This precious score is still the orchestra's library copy, so if a conductor wants to use it while working with the orchestra, they can. Not surprisingly, they do. This much handled score is a symphonic icon. It contains markings in the hands of Mahler himself, some made obviously with care at a desk, others so crude they could only have been made in rehearsal. Then there are another batch by his pupil Bruno Walter who conducted the orchestra in the 40s, and still others by Bernstein, greatest of all Mahler's late 20th-century champions. When Bernstein died in 1990, his family bequeathed his 3,500 conducting scores. One that is coming to the Barbican is Bernstein's score of the Mahler's Symphony No 6, on whose opening page the conductor affixed a bumper sticker announcing MAHLER GROOVES. \"You've got to love him, haven't you?\" says Haws. Listen to Haws talking about her orchestra and you soon realise that the most special place in her heart belongs not to any of the famous names who have made the New York Philharmonic what it is, but to the very first conductor long ago, the delightfully named Ureli Corelli Hill, a musicians' musician from Connecticut who conducted the orchestra long before Bernstein ever claimed to be the first American to get the job. Haws hands me another ancient score. There is barely a mark on this one, befitting the Ureli Corelli Hill era, when the conductor simply kept the musicians together. But what a treasure this one is too. \"This is a first edition of the Beethoven fifth, published in Vienna, the first work we ever played in 1842,\" says Haws. \"When I showed it to Masur he said, 'Ah, you know there is a famous misprint in the first edition.' I was so worried that Ureli Corelli might not have known about the misprint, but Masur looked and, yes, they had blocked it out. Oh I was so relieved about that. I was so proud of them. Isn't that a thing to be able to do, to hold a first edition of the Beethoven fifth? Now you see why I became an archivist.\" \u0095 The New York Philharmonic plays at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 4141), on Saturday and Sunday. Items from the orchestra archive will be on display till Sunday.",

A low and vacant plinth, waiting for something to happen, with more lightbulbs glowing around its edge, a tawdry halo of expectancy. A lone and distant bird in a high white sky, a huge distance caught in the camera's eye. Blue curtains sifting blue light on to a blue mirror, veiling the world outside and spilling over the silver cellophane wrappers of thousands of sweets. Walk through a blue and white bead curtain, and think for a moment that it could almost be rain (it is called Water). This is the work of Felix Gonzalez-Torres, currently at the Serpentine and on billboards around London (a single unexplained image - two dented pillows side by side, rumpled sheets, the aftermath of sleep or sex). </p> <p>There are more works, discretely displayed in the Print Room at the V&amp;A, and in the studios of the Royal College of Art across the way. More lightbulbs, too, strung out on Finchley Road near Camden Arts Centre, competing with north London streetlights and traffic lights, headlights and noise. </p> <p>Whenever one reads about him, one is told that a spirit of generosity pervades Gonzalez-Torres's work, and that his work is of seminal importance. Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine, goes so far as to claim that he was one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Lightbulbs, beads and sheer blue curtains, a number of newspaper-cutting jigsaws in plastic bags, a few photos, an endless supply of sweets (courtesy of Marks and Spencer), and some stacks of posters you can take away - the claim, surely, is going it a bit. </p> <p>Something is missing. Gonzalez-Torres, born in Cuba in 1957, raised in Spain and Puerto Rico, spent his working life in the US, where he died in 1996: a career and a life cut short by Aids. Justifying the \"generosity\" of Gonzalez-Torres's work, or its continuing significance, requires a little more than trust in the artist's intentions, or in the critical and curatorial affidavits filed in his name. Does his generosity go further than offering sweets to strangers? You can fill your pockets with them, and take any number of posters from the perfectly aligned stacks on the floor. For once no one will stop you, and however minimal and pure these arrangements of things might look, you won't make a dent in the heaps and piles and stacks. What you get with Gonzalez-Torres is a kind of deceptive minimalism, re-done in the wrong materials. Whatever you take will be replaced. And what exactly have you got, rolled-up in your hand, or soft on your tongue? </p> <p>\"Without the public these works are nothing,\" he said. \"I need the public to complete the work. I ask the public to help me, to take responsibility, to become part of my work, to join in.\" He said the sweets were a kind of gift - perhaps even a kind of profane communion wafer. Eating them becomes an act of transubstantiation. \"You put it in your mouth and you suck on someone else's body, and in this way my work becomes part of so many other people's bodies. For just a few seconds, I have put something sweet in someone's mouth, and that is very sexy.\" </p> <p>Sexy maybe, but also kind of deathly - the pile of endlessly replenished green sweets in a sugar candy corner between the walls and floor weighs in at 75lbs, the weight of the artist's lover, sick with Aids. The silver carpet of sweets on the gallery floor weighs a ton, and is called Placebo. Nothing is got for nothing. Like the public \"Carrying\" performances of the late Pepe Espaliu, in which the artist was passed along the street by a procession of friends and supporters, Gonzalez-Torres's sexy gifts can be understood in terms of disease and its transmission, as well as savoured in terms of an immediate pleasure, a sugar-rush. Illness is not a metaphor, but art always is, as it deals in the slippery language of things and images, stories and presences, things that are never quite themselves. Gonzalez-Torres understood this. His work was autobiographical, poetic and, however much grounded in the severities of theory, always open to the exigencies of real life and lived experience. </p> <p>One might think of his work in terms of a lightness of materials, and light-handedness in their use and display. The things he used were commonplace and ephemeral but like those planets where a thimble-full of matter weighs thousands of kilos, his work also had an unrelieving density of meaning. This is the point at which Gonzalez-Torres begins to reveal himself, and earns our respect. He makes many of his peers and followers look obvious and banal, even when he himself worked with things that seemed more banal than most. His work was allusive, deceptive, tactful. </p> <p>Gonzalez-Torres makes repeated reference to homoerotic desire: two identical, untitled metal rings on the wall; two dented pillows on a rumpled bed; two identical clocks placed side by side, set to precisely the same time, in perfect synchronicity. Two the same, together. The metaphor could not be plainer, or so understated. Two rings, two clocks, two nests of lightbulbs, two mirrors - Gonzales-Torres entertained the notion that these simple forms, at once resonant of the reserve and simplicity of the post-minimal gesture, could also be taken as deeply sexualised images, but ones that apoplectic congressmen could not condemn, unlike, say, images of two men having sex. </p> <p>Gonzalez-Torres was all for the multiplicity of readings his art still provokes. He knew that context slanted reason, that the narratives the audience bought to his works completed them. One needs to speak of his body of work as though it were an actual body. And of its place alongside other works, other artists and intentions, as among other bodies, other consciences. </p> <p> Part of his strength lay in what I can only call his disguise of passivity, the fluidity of his approach. His work makes me think of a man threading his way through a crowd, at once anonymous and particular. For a while he worked as a waiter and would come home and surf the TV channels. \"Everything,\" he said, \"boiled down to the same level of meaninglessness... the most horrific news next to the most glamorous gold ring next to the most glamorous celebrity next to cooking oil.\" </p> <p>He began to make word-portraits and lists, charting the flow of global news events alongside personal milestones and memories. These text pieces were too resonant and elegiac to be mere footnotes. As well as a number of texts set out on shiny black photostat paper (the screen is empty, but the news rolls on), one text runs around the inner lip of the Serpentine's cupola. \"Watercolors 1964. Blue Lake 1986. Our Own Apt. 1976. Ross 1983. Black Monday 1987. The World I Knew Is Gone 1991.\" He marks the fall of the Berlin wall, the foundation of the UN, vivid personal moments, deaths, places. Somewhere among the rolling news headlines we find equivalents to Citizen Kane's Rosebud, Proust's soggy madeleine. </p> <p>The vacant plinth stands directly below this text. Hang around long enough and that empty dias with its corona of footlights will eventually be occupied, by a man in gold lam\u00e9 trunks, go-go dancing to music only he can hear on his personal stereo. The performance lasts just five minutes, at an unappointed time, every single day. You might catch it, you might miss it. You are here anyway. Is this a good place to be? In the next room two stacks of posters, waist-high, stand together, the sheaves replenished every day. One poster says, \"Nowhere better than this place\". The other, \"Somewhere better than this place\". Some things you can take with you. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020 7402 6075), till July 16.</p>",

Like the public \"Carrying\" performances of the late Pepe Espaliu, in which the artist was passed along the street by a procession of friends and supporters, Gonzalez-Torres's sexy gifts can be understood in terms of disease and its transmission, as well as savoured in terms of an immediate pleasure, a sugar-rush. Illness is not a metaphor, but art always is, as it deals in the slippery language of things and images, stories and presences, things that are never quite themselves. Gonzalez-Torres understood this. His work was autobiographical, poetic and, however much grounded in the severities of theory, always open to the exigencies of real life and lived experience. One might think of his work in terms of a lightness of materials, and light-handedness in their use and display. The things he used were commonplace and ephemeral but like those planets where a thimble-full of matter weighs thousands of kilos, his work also had an unrelieving density of meaning. This is the point at which Gonzalez-Torres begins to reveal himself, and earns our respect. He makes many of his peers and followers look obvious and banal, even when he himself worked with things that seemed more banal than most. His work was allusive, deceptive, tactful. Gonzalez-Torres makes repeated reference to homoerotic desire: two identical, untitled metal rings on the wall; two dented pillows on a rumpled bed; two identical clocks placed side by side, set to precisely the same time, in perfect synchronicity. Two the same, together. The metaphor could not be plainer, or so understated. Two rings, two clocks, two nests of lightbulbs, two mirrors - Gonzales-Torres entertained the notion that these simple forms, at once resonant of the reserve and simplicity of the post-minimal gesture, could also be taken as deeply sexualised images, but ones that apoplectic congressmen could not condemn, unlike, say, images of two men having sex. Gonzalez-Torres was all for the multiplicity of readings his art still provokes. He knew that context slanted reason, that the narratives the audience bought to his works completed them. One needs to speak of his body of work as though it were an actual body. And of its place alongside other works, other artists and intentions, as among other bodies, other consciences. Part of his strength lay in what I can only call his disguise of passivity, the fluidity of his approach. His work makes me think of a man threading his way through a crowd, at once anonymous and particular. For a while he worked as a waiter and would come home and surf the TV channels. \"Everything,\" he said, \"boiled down to the same level of meaninglessness... the most horrific news next to the most glamorous gold ring next to the most glamorous celebrity next to cooking oil.\" He began to make word-portraits and lists, charting the flow of global news events alongside personal milestones and memories. These text pieces were too resonant and elegiac to be mere footnotes. As well as a number of texts set out on shiny black photostat paper (the screen is empty, but the news rolls on), one text runs around the inner lip of the Serpentine's cupola. \"Watercolors 1964. Blue Lake 1986. Our Own Apt. 1976. Ross 1983. Black Monday 1987. The World I Knew Is Gone 1991.\" He marks the fall of the Berlin wall, the foundation of the UN, vivid personal moments, deaths, places. Somewhere among the rolling news headlines we find equivalents to Citizen Kane's Rosebud, Proust's soggy madeleine. The vacant plinth stands directly below this text. Hang around long enough and that empty dias with its corona of footlights will eventually be occupied, by a man in gold lam\u00e9 trunks, go-go dancing to music only he can hear on his personal stereo. The performance lasts just five minutes, at an unappointed time, every single day. You might catch it, you might miss it. You are here anyway. Is this a good place to be? In the next room two stacks of posters, waist-high, stand together, the sheaves replenished every day. One poster says, \"Nowhere better than this place\". The other, \"Somewhere better than this place\". Some things you can take with you. \u0095 At the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020 7402 6075), till July 16.",

It was for my share of the deposit on a house we were buying together.

No. My own personal Ms Hyde took up residence and I treated him to the entire repertoire - furious ranting on irrelevant matters, petulant fight-picking, seething silence or irritable monosyllables, aggressive housework. In short, I metamorphosed into the harridan from hell.</p> <p>It took me a while to work out the reason for my unpleasant behaviour. It wasn't the idea of cohabiting that was bothering me - we have, after all, been living together for a year. It wasn't that I didn't like the house. It wasn't even that estate agents seemed to be incapable of getting their heads around the fact that I don't have the same surname as him. (If I'd been given a tenner for the number of times I answered the phone and had to say, no, they couldn't speak to my husband because I didn't have one, I could have bought the whole street.)

The money I handed over to my boyfriend is the economic representation of my whole life, right from money given at my christening, to savings from teenage waitressing jobs, to whatever slices of various salaries I could afford to put by, to the advance for my first novel. In turning all this over to him and committing myself to a shared space, I was, these eminent thinkers assured me, relinquishing my autonomy, my independence. I'd set myself full-tilt on a very slippery slope, at the bottom of which was me, chained to the dishwasher, manacled to the cooker, condemned to ironing his socks into Sisyphean eternity. I'd have no time for my own work. Forget the pram: this was the man in the hallway and he was a far more sinister figure.</p> <p>Or was he? When I'd steeled myself for a confrontation, I went to look for my boyfriend. What I found didn't exactly match up with the terrible Brocken Spectre of misogyny I'd conjured up in my fevered imagination: he was standing in the kitchen cooking our dinner. While I delivered my speech, he listened, simultaneously clearing the table, getting out plates, dishing up the food and laying out cutlery. When I'd finished, he looked both surprised and relieved. \"I wondered what was wrong with you,\" he said, dishtowel in hand.</p> <p>But this is not a happy ending to a story of paranoid stupidity. I've realised that my confused tantrums point to a strange hole in current feminist thought.

It's OK, we are told, to wear make-up, have a job, have sex. But what happens if you do all those things but just prefer your sex with the one man - and buy a house together to do it in?

From Elizabeth Wurtzel, a woman who poses nude for her books in what we are told is the spirit of irony, we get Bitch Rules on how to rationalise having a cleaner and not helping our fellow females to wash up after a dinner party, while Professor Greer incites a wide debate on the wearing (or not) of pants.</p> <p>It seems to me that somewhere along the line, theory has been dislodged from reality. What feminism needs to catch up with and adjust to is the generation of men that have been brought up within its strictures. My boyfriend and others like him have been raised by liberated, emancipated women with their own careers and their own lives. This is not to say that all blokes whose birth certificates postdate 1970 are OK, so our struggle is at an end. Far from it.

The revelations came on top of feverish speculation about the prospect of a royal wedding after the rapprochement between the Queen and Mrs Parker Bowles on Saturday. The 10-minute meeting at Highgrove, the prince's Gloucestershire home, was seen as the first step in drawing his mistress into an official royal role, a move which opens up the prospect of a wedding and a future Queen Camilla.

      "bodyText": "President Bill Clinton said yesterday that as he neared the end of his eight years in the White House, he did not know whether Washington and Moscow would be friends or foes, making it plain that he was unsure where Russia was heading under Vladimir Putin. In a muted, slightly melancholy 44-minute speech to the duma, the Russian parliament, Mr Clinton reflected on the past decade of tumultuous upheaval in Russia, preached the gospel of globalisation to its suffering people and called on its new leadership to make the right choices to cement partnership with the west. \"We are not destined to be adversaries. But it is not guaranteed we will be allies,\" the president said at the end of a trip that included his first formal summit with Mr Putin and was noteworthy for the lack of warmth between the two men. \"All my life I have wanted the people of my country and the people of your country to be friends and allies, to lead the world away from war towards the dreams of children. I have done my best to do that.\" It was Mr Clinton's fifth and final visit to Russia as president, and yesterday's speech was the first time a US president had addressed the duma. But the wistful, elegiac character of Mr Clinton's valedictory speech failed to elicit a sense of occasion from his audience. Mr Putin did not attend, leaving for Italy and a meeting last night with the Pope. Dozens of seats in the parliament were vacant. No applause interrupted the speech, and only brief, half-hearted, clapping was heard at the end. Nationalists and communists protested outside the duma in support of Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic, while inside, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist, heckled Mr Clinton. Weightier figures such as Boris Gryzlov, a key lieutenant of Mr Putin in parliament, and Andrei Nikolayev, the head of the duma defence committee, were either angry or dismissive of the Clinton speech. \"We have to learn to identify and manage our disagreements because the relationship is profoundly important to the future,\" Mr Clinton advised. \"Our interests are not identical and we will have our inevitable disagreements.\" He urged the new Russian government to diversify its economy, establish new tax and property laws, and tackle crime and corruption, all to make Russia more attractive to foreign investors. \"The people of Russia do not yet have the Russia they were promised in 1991,\" he said, saying it was difficult to \"weigh the gains of freedom against the pains of economic hardship, corruption and crime\". In a direct reference to Mr Putin's pledge to restore order and stability, Mr Clinton said: \"The answer to law without order is not order without law.\" Following the speech he briefly visited Boris Yeltsin at his country dacha outside Moscow, quipping that it was \"just like old times\". In contrast to the bonhomie and backslapping of the Bill-and-Boris years, there was no first-name greetings between Mr Clinton and Mr Putin, who was described by one US official as a \"cold fish\". Since the new year, Mr Putin has set his sights on bonding with Tony Blair, and Downing Street has hailed the instant rapport between the two leaders. But Mr Clinton appeared warier, while Mr Putin was polite but distant, clearly viewing Mr Clinton as a lame duck.",

The American divorcee engraved the tiny gem-encrusted box with the routes of their continental holidays together during the summers of 1934, 1935 and 1936 when the then Prince of Wales wooed her. Patricia Clarke, of Christie's, said the box was an \"important and quite emotive historical artefact\" which chronicled the development of the royal romance. The vanity case - which originally went under the hammer during the sale of items from the Windsors' Paris home in 1987 - is expected to make \u00a335,000. Edward VIII later abdicated so that he could marry her after American newspapers reported how the as yet uncrowned king was travelling openly with his unchaperoned, twice-married mistress. The British press had studiously ignored the romance as it blossomed over the previous two summers. The skiing party the prince took to Kitzb\u00fchel in the Austrian Tyrol the previous winter, when Mrs Simpson was chaperoned by her Aunt Bessie, is also detailed on the compact and lipstick holder. Her husband, Ernest Simpson, had been invited to join them on the slopes but declined - ostensibly because of business commitments back home in America.

      "body": "<p>The first thing you need to know is the difference between chat rooms, bulletin boards and mailing lists. Chat rooms or online web conferences involve live discussion, and tend to attract more social chat. Bulletin boards are held on websites, and anyone can post comments or read past contributions. Mailing lists require registration; you will be emailed all the contributions sent to the list and can email in your own. Some lists are open to anyone, others grant membership to certain groups. Most keep archives of previous messages. </p> <p>So what do these discussion forums offer? A chance to share practices, ideas and resources, says Debs Ayerst, education officer at Becta. \"They help prevent everyone reinventing the wheel. If you're searching for books for a particular part of the literacy hour, for instance, you may find someone has already looked into it, which can cut out an awful lot of research.\" </p> <p>According to Rachel Turner, administrator for the Early Language Learning Forum at the <a href=\"http://www.nacell.org.uk/networking/ell_forum.htm\">National Advisory Centre on Early Language Learning</a>, which has more than 150 people registered, discussion forums are particularly useful for teachers living in remote areas. </p> <p>To get started, focus on what you're most interested in, then sign up to a relevant list and lurk around, reading messages, while you decide whether it's for you. And when seeking advice, keep it succinct, advises Turner. \"You've got to be quite pertinent otherwise you may get 20 replies that are not relevant.\" </p> <p>So what's available?

      "bodyText": "The first thing you need to know is the difference between chat rooms, bulletin boards and mailing lists. Chat rooms or online web conferences involve live discussion, and tend to attract more social chat. Bulletin boards are held on websites, and anyone can post comments or read past contributions. Mailing lists require registration; you will be emailed all the contributions sent to the list and can email in your own. Some lists are open to anyone, others grant membership to certain groups. Most keep archives of previous messages. So what do these discussion forums offer? A chance to share practices, ideas and resources, says Debs Ayerst, education officer at Becta. \"They help prevent everyone reinventing the wheel. If you're searching for books for a particular part of the literacy hour, for instance, you may find someone has already looked into it, which can cut out an awful lot of research.\" According to Rachel Turner, administrator for the Early Language Learning Forum at the National Advisory Centre on Early Language Learning, which has more than 150 people registered, discussion forums are particularly useful for teachers living in remote areas. To get started, focus on what you're most interested in, then sign up to a relevant list and lurk around, reading messages, while you decide whether it's for you. And when seeking advice, keep it succinct, advises Turner. \"You've got to be quite pertinent otherwise you may get 20 replies that are not relevant.\" So what's available? The Virtual Teachers Centre offers conferences covering subjects such as curriculum areas, senior managers, special educational needs, and over 50 mailing lists devoted to a wide range of educational issues. Becta, also offers various SEN and inclusion focused mailing lists. Mailbase runs many electronic discussion lists for the UK higher education and research community. If it doesn't have a list that interests you, it will help you set one up. Teachers.net is a US site with a healthy UK contingent. Otherwise look on Liszt, which has a directory of worldwide mailing lists, including 112 covering education, and some more unusual areas like distance education and home-schooling.",

When the camp was finally liberated by American troops, Wiesel remembers that \"our first act as free men was to throw ourselves on to provisions. We thought only of that.

      "body": "<p>Have you heard about Gary Rhodes, the telly chef, and Baroness Lockwood of Dewsbury? Or, for that matter, Jimmy Choo, the shoe designer, and Kay Mellor, the celebrated TV playwright? Or Richard Griffiths, who played creepy Uncle Monty in the film Withnail and I, and Marco Marenghi, lead animator for the BBC telly series Walking with Dinosaurs?</p> <p>If by now you tingle with the juicy anticipation of something more usually found in the News of the Screws, you'll be disappointed. </p> <p>Gary Rhodes and the Baroness, who happens to be deputy speaker of the House of Lords, do share something, but it isn't romps on the Woolsack. In fact all six have this common trait: they all went to a further education college and they're all about to be honoured for it. </p> <p>Weather permitting, they'll all be basking on the Thames-side terrace at the House of Commons on Thursday, each the proud new possessor of a Gold Award. </p> <p>It seems a bit weird in one sense to be dishing out, decades later, honours to people simply for having once gone to a further education college. But, as in so many cases where well-known and important people get gonged, the awarder expects to get as much, if not more, out of it as the recipient. </p> <p>\"We feel it is important to raise the profile of further education in as many ways as possible,\" says Alice Brown, of the Association of Colleges, who has organised the awards. </p> <p>\"The Gold Awards afford us the opportunity to celebrate the way in which these colleges have had a direct impact on these individuals, who have gone on to excel in their chosen field.\" </p> <p>Five years ago, the association's predecessor ran a similar wheeze, but it fizzled out. Now it is being revived as the Gold Awards, and last October the call went out for colleges to bring out their famous and eminent former students. In fact only 32 out of about 450 institutions came up with the goods. It's disappointing, perhaps, but at least it means there will be plenty of untapped territory when the call goes out this autumn. </p> <p>For the judges, members of the Association of Colleges charitable trust, it has not merely been a case of creaming off the six biggest names. They have deliberately spread the awards between industries and not, for instance, picked six from showbiz. The key factor for winners has been their acknowledgement to the importance in their lives of their colleges. </p> <p>\"All these candidates have said that further education had a bearing on their success,\" says Brown. Gary Rhodes, for example, says: \"Thanet College was the base to my full catering career.\" He visits the college to give demonstrations and present awards. </p> <p>Kay Mellor, best known for her television series \"Band of Gold\" and \"Playing the Field\", enrolled on a part-time childcare course as a teen mum and discovered her \"thirst for education\" at Park Lane college, Leeds. A string of O and A levels followed, before she won a place at drama school in her mid 20s. </p> <p>\"I have grabbed every opportunity to live life to the full since,\" she says. </p> <p>Baroness Lockwood's early career in the Labour party led on from her secretarial studies course at Dewsbury College. Marco Marenghi did an HND Animation programme at Pontypridd College. Richard Griffiths studied O levels at Stockton and Billingham College after leaving secondary modern with no significant achievements.

      "bodyText": "Have you heard about Gary Rhodes, the telly chef, and Baroness Lockwood of Dewsbury? Or, for that matter, Jimmy Choo, the shoe designer, and Kay Mellor, the celebrated TV playwright? Or Richard Griffiths, who played creepy Uncle Monty in the film Withnail and I, and Marco Marenghi, lead animator for the BBC telly series Walking with Dinosaurs? If by now you tingle with the juicy anticipation of something more usually found in the News of the Screws, you'll be disappointed. Gary Rhodes and the Baroness, who happens to be deputy speaker of the House of Lords, do share something, but it isn't romps on the Woolsack. In fact all six have this common trait: they all went to a further education college and they're all about to be honoured for it. Weather permitting, they'll all be basking on the Thames-side terrace at the House of Commons on Thursday, each the proud new possessor of a Gold Award. It seems a bit weird in one sense to be dishing out, decades later, honours to people simply for having once gone to a further education college. But, as in so many cases where well-known and important people get gonged, the awarder expects to get as much, if not more, out of it as the recipient. \"We feel it is important to raise the profile of further education in as many ways as possible,\" says Alice Brown, of the Association of Colleges, who has organised the awards. \"The Gold Awards afford us the opportunity to celebrate the way in which these colleges have had a direct impact on these individuals, who have gone on to excel in their chosen field.\" Five years ago, the association's predecessor ran a similar wheeze, but it fizzled out. Now it is being revived as the Gold Awards, and last October the call went out for colleges to bring out their famous and eminent former students. In fact only 32 out of about 450 institutions came up with the goods. It's disappointing, perhaps, but at least it means there will be plenty of untapped territory when the call goes out this autumn. For the judges, members of the Association of Colleges charitable trust, it has not merely been a case of creaming off the six biggest names. They have deliberately spread the awards between industries and not, for instance, picked six from showbiz. The key factor for winners has been their acknowledgement to the importance in their lives of their colleges. \"All these candidates have said that further education had a bearing on their success,\" says Brown. Gary Rhodes, for example, says: \"Thanet College was the base to my full catering career.\" He visits the college to give demonstrations and present awards. Kay Mellor, best known for her television series \"Band of Gold\" and \"Playing the Field\", enrolled on a part-time childcare course as a teen mum and discovered her \"thirst for education\" at Park Lane college, Leeds. A string of O and A levels followed, before she won a place at drama school in her mid 20s. \"I have grabbed every opportunity to live life to the full since,\" she says. Baroness Lockwood's early career in the Labour party led on from her secretarial studies course at Dewsbury College. Marco Marenghi did an HND Animation programme at Pontypridd College. Richard Griffiths studied O levels at Stockton and Billingham College after leaving secondary modern with no significant achievements. Jimmy Choo studied footwear design at Cordwainers College and, on leaving, opened a small shoemaking company in Hackney.",

      "body": "<p>We've heard it so often, it's become a sort of leitmotif: the post-16 Learning and Skills reforms will save the country \u00a350m.</p> <p>Ministers made the promise last July and have reaffirmed it more than once when challenged by opposition MPs. This saving in running costs is one justification for the disruption and expense of the reforms, so the figures are worth a look. </p> <p>The first rule in making comparisons is know your starting point. You cannot verify the \u00a350 million saving without knowing the cost of the current arrangements. Reaching this figure is not easy, because much post-16 administration is covered by large departments whose activities cover a wider field. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment, for instance, will spend \u00a3265m in 2000/1 on administration, but does not publish figures to work out how much is spent on individual areas: schools, universities etc. The same is true of Ofsted (2000/1 budget: \u00a3106m) and the government offices for the regions. </p> <p>It's a complex picture. But there was some relief for number crunchers when Malcolm Wicks, the Lifelong Learning Minister, gave detailed estimates in the House of Commons in May. He reported that the current total spending on the national and local administration of post-16 education and training was \u00a3250-280m and that the \u00a350m saving would bring this down to \u00a3200-230m. </p> <p>Savings would come from reduced staffing in 10 regional government offices (\u00a315m) and from having 47 Local Learning and Skills Councils in place of 82 TECs (another \u00a335m). In other words, a 20% saving achieved by reducing the headcount, reorganising functions and minimising IT and office costs. Textbook rationalisation. Welcome if the \u00a350m saved is put to good use. </p> <p>In the short-term, the Learning and Skills reform results in increased expenditure. Malcolm Wicks also summarised this in May. \u00a335m is needed this year to set up the Learning and Skills Council, including \u00a310m for a new IT system. These short-term costs have their payback in the promised savings of \u00a350m, but they may not be the only expenditure in the pipeline. The transfer of assets, liabilities and staff contracts on April 1, 2001 could throw up further transactions not currently anticipated. Assets will include money owed by providers who have missed their targets. Liabilities: commitments under existing contracts, plus redundancy payments for staff who lose their jobs. </p> <p>DfEE civil servants have worked hard to anticipate every eventuality, but no plan is ever complete. A full account won't be available until after the event and, even then, it will be difficult to sort out cause and effect.

      "bodyText": "We've heard it so often, it's become a sort of leitmotif: the post-16 Learning and Skills reforms will save the country \u00a350m. Ministers made the promise last July and have reaffirmed it more than once when challenged by opposition MPs. This saving in running costs is one justification for the disruption and expense of the reforms, so the figures are worth a look. The first rule in making comparisons is know your starting point. You cannot verify the \u00a350 million saving without knowing the cost of the current arrangements. Reaching this figure is not easy, because much post-16 administration is covered by large departments whose activities cover a wider field. The Department for Education and Employment, for instance, will spend \u00a3265m in 2000/1 on administration, but does not publish figures to work out how much is spent on individual areas: schools, universities etc. The same is true of Ofsted (2000/1 budget: \u00a3106m) and the government offices for the regions. It's a complex picture. But there was some relief for number crunchers when Malcolm Wicks, the Lifelong Learning Minister, gave detailed estimates in the House of Commons in May. He reported that the current total spending on the national and local administration of post-16 education and training was \u00a3250-280m and that the \u00a350m saving would bring this down to \u00a3200-230m. Savings would come from reduced staffing in 10 regional government offices (\u00a315m) and from having 47 Local Learning and Skills Councils in place of 82 TECs (another \u00a335m). In other words, a 20% saving achieved by reducing the headcount, reorganising functions and minimising IT and office costs. Textbook rationalisation. Welcome if the \u00a350m saved is put to good use. In the short-term, the Learning and Skills reform results in increased expenditure. Malcolm Wicks also summarised this in May. \u00a335m is needed this year to set up the Learning and Skills Council, including \u00a310m for a new IT system. These short-term costs have their payback in the promised savings of \u00a350m, but they may not be the only expenditure in the pipeline. The transfer of assets, liabilities and staff contracts on April 1, 2001 could throw up further transactions not currently anticipated. Assets will include money owed by providers who have missed their targets. Liabilities: commitments under existing contracts, plus redundancy payments for staff who lose their jobs. DfEE civil servants have worked hard to anticipate every eventuality, but no plan is ever complete. A full account won't be available until after the event and, even then, it will be difficult to sort out cause and effect. For example, if reports that TEC staff have been leaving early are correct, then this will help keep the redundancy costs low in March 2001. We won't know the full story until 2002 and only then, if some body like the National Audit Office takes an interest and gathers some data. If not, we'll have to take it on trust. A more important issue than the level of the saving is the effectiveness of the new spending. One change is the plan to have strong national systems, locally administered. Another is the planning and improvement role for the local councils. These will have their own impact on the administration costs of providers. The costs - compliance costs - are often left out of the discussions about savings, but should not be.

And, even if it does, new initiatives could simply displace costs. The initiatives with the most political support - education maintenance allowances and learning accounts - are often the ones which impose the biggest administrative burden on providers. Their responsiveness to individual circumstances is an advantage, but it is also expensive if the right systems are not in place. So. This \u00a350 million saving - will it really happen? The honest answer is that we'll never really know. \u0095 Julian Gravatt is Registrar at Lewisham College.",

      "body": "<p>In 1941, Kurt Gerstein joined the Schutzstaffel (SS). Gerstein was not enticed by the magnetism of Hitler - he joined the SS to find out if rumours about the murder of patients with physical and mental disabilities were true. </p> <p>In the summer of 1942, he visited the death camps of Belzec and Treblinka, and witnessed the murder of thousands of Jews in the purpose-built gas chambers. This experience drove Gerstein in a personal mission to let the world know about the Nazis' crimes. His report, smuggled out to the Swedish and British governments, and the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches in Berlin, was met with a wall of silence. In 1945, filled with despair, Kurt Gerstein took his own life. </p> <p>But what Gerstein witnessed will not be forgotten, as it forms part of the Imperial War Museum's permanent Holocaust Exhibition in London, which the Queen formally opens today. Last Wednesday, pupils from the Notre Dame school in Lingfield, Sussex, visited the exhibition - Graham Smith, Pritesh Patel and Jonathan Gibbons in year 9, and Katy Turner and Heloise Brown in year 10. The boys have not yet studied the holocaust, but had a good general knowledge of what it was. The girls had already learnt of the holocaust through their history GCSE studies. </p> <p>Asked why the Jews in particular were persecuted, Graham thought people were jealous of their wealth. Katy pointed to the belief in Germany that a worldwide Jewish conspiracy had led to defeat in the first world war and the humiliation of Versailles. </p> <p>But, holocaust education co-ordinator Paul Salmons argued, these are reasons to look for a scapegoat, not why people hated the Jews. The students overlooked the religious dimension: that for centuries, the Christian church had erroneously laid the blame for Christ's death on the Jews. </p> <p>Schools who visit the museum receive a video, \"The way we were\", which combines personal recollections with original film footage to give a sense of the lives of Jews before the rise of Hitler. It shows the strong sense of community in Poland, and the fact that Jews living in Germany, mainly wealthy professionals, considered themselves German first, Jewish second. For them, the holocaust was a double betrayal. </p> <p>The exhibition features artefacts, with information presented on a striking backdrop of black or red tiled walls. Monitors relay authentic film footage - in one, Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels propounds his anti-Jewish rhetoric; in another, survivors weep when they recall the cruel separation of families. </p> <p>The pupils were also given audio guides that provided a commentary to the exhibition.

      "bodyText": "In 1941, Kurt Gerstein joined the Schutzstaffel (SS). Gerstein was not enticed by the magnetism of Hitler - he joined the SS to find out if rumours about the murder of patients with physical and mental disabilities were true. In the summer of 1942, he visited the death camps of Belzec and Treblinka, and witnessed the murder of thousands of Jews in the purpose-built gas chambers. This experience drove Gerstein in a personal mission to let the world know about the Nazis' crimes. His report, smuggled out to the Swedish and British governments, and the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches in Berlin, was met with a wall of silence. In 1945, filled with despair, Kurt Gerstein took his own life. But what Gerstein witnessed will not be forgotten, as it forms part of the Imperial War Museum's permanent Holocaust Exhibition in London, which the Queen formally opens today. Last Wednesday, pupils from the Notre Dame school in Lingfield, Sussex, visited the exhibition - Graham Smith, Pritesh Patel and Jonathan Gibbons in year 9, and Katy Turner and Heloise Brown in year 10. The boys have not yet studied the holocaust, but had a good general knowledge of what it was. The girls had already learnt of the holocaust through their history GCSE studies. Asked why the Jews in particular were persecuted, Graham thought people were jealous of their wealth. Katy pointed to the belief in Germany that a worldwide Jewish conspiracy had led to defeat in the first world war and the humiliation of Versailles. But, holocaust education co-ordinator Paul Salmons argued, these are reasons to look for a scapegoat, not why people hated the Jews. The students overlooked the religious dimension: that for centuries, the Christian church had erroneously laid the blame for Christ's death on the Jews. Schools who visit the museum receive a video, \"The way we were\", which combines personal recollections with original film footage to give a sense of the lives of Jews before the rise of Hitler. It shows the strong sense of community in Poland, and the fact that Jews living in Germany, mainly wealthy professionals, considered themselves German first, Jewish second. For them, the holocaust was a double betrayal. The exhibition features artefacts, with information presented on a striking backdrop of black or red tiled walls. Monitors relay authentic film footage - in one, Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels propounds his anti-Jewish rhetoric; in another, survivors weep when they recall the cruel separation of families. The pupils were also given audio guides that provided a commentary to the exhibition. Katy found this use of a variety of media good, but Heloise pointed out that sometimes there was so much going on that it was difficult to follow. However, by walking through the various sections, she had a clear sense of how events took on a horrible momentum, culminating in the death camps. Pritesh thought the use of photographs from the time brought it home that these were real people.

      "body": "<p>The proud Norman, Bishop Odo, commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry to show the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons on a battlefield near Hastings. Except it wasn't a tapestry, it was an embroidery. Nearly 1,000 years later, the staff, pupils and parents of Hampton junior school in Middlesex have produced their own triumph of the art of needlework - a visual representation of the Maths 2000 \"100\" square. Except it isn't a tapestry either.</p> <p>The square was the brainchild of maths co-ordinator, Jackie Stevens. The government drive to raise standards in numeracy places a strong emphasis on the number 100 to teach children about numbers. Stevens wanted to present this in a new, permanent way, as something that pupils would be able to see and use on a daily basis. She came up with the idea of producing a giant patchwork to represent this magical square.

      "bodyText": "The proud Norman, Bishop Odo, commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry to show the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons on a battlefield near Hastings. Except it wasn't a tapestry, it was an embroidery. Nearly 1,000 years later, the staff, pupils and parents of Hampton junior school in Middlesex have produced their own triumph of the art of needlework - a visual representation of the Maths 2000 \"100\" square. Except it isn't a tapestry either. The square was the brainchild of maths co-ordinator, Jackie Stevens. The government drive to raise standards in numeracy places a strong emphasis on the number 100 to teach children about numbers. Stevens wanted to present this in a new, permanent way, as something that pupils would be able to see and use on a daily basis. She came up with the idea of producing a giant patchwork to represent this magical square. With the help of a \u00a32,000 grant, the vision became a reality. Stevens says: \"I was aware of the need to produce something that would involve lots of parents and the school community as a whole.

      "body": "<p>There is a scene near the beginning of David Duchovny's new movie in which the actor is seen applying a hairdryer to his trousers in the moments before an important ceremony. He is goofing about on one foot while his wife, played by Joely Richardson, looks on in an \"isn't my husband adorable?\" reverie and the dog huffs and puffs on the floor between them. For those whose knowledge of Duchovny derives solely from his role as agent Fox Mulder in the X-Files, a man to whom the concepts of romance and comedy are the most alien he'll ever encounter, it is an uncomfortable moment. The very act of smiling seems undignified on the lips of an actor whose emotional range has come to be characterised by various shades of the unamused. </p> <p>Once over the initial shock, however, Return to Me is a surprisingly likeable film. Written and directed by Bonnie Hunt, it is the story of a woman who receives a heart transplant from the dead wife of the man she comes to fall in love with. Duchovny is the widower, Minnie Driver the post-op sweetheart and, if you can stomach the dodgy symbolism and the sentimental portrait of Chicago's ethnic communities, it is a witty and old-fashioned fairy tale that leaves you feeling well disposed towards them both. For Duchovny, it is a chance to prove that he has more expressions in his repertoire than scepticism, although he insists that's not why he did it. \"I know I'm funny, I don't have to go out and prove it. I don't understand why I would have to prove that I'm funny. I do what I do and I'll do what's interesting to me. But the idea of proving anything to anyone is just weird to me. I don't give a shit.\" </p> <p>This is delivered deadpan, like a well-buried joke, although he doesn't appear to be joking. While unfailingly courteous, his professional manner has the unfortunate effect of hanging somewhere between arrogance and conceit. When we return to the subject of him not having to prove himself, he mutters that it's \"bullshit\", as if it were a line he has grown weary of. He retains the faintly superior air of one whose inner life is beyond the reach of the people that surround him. </p> <p>Duchovny, who is 40 this year, was born in New York to a Scottish, working-class mother and a father whose family originally came from Russia. He was as American as the next kid, he says, but unlike many of his friends, was able to perceive his culture with a certain amount of detached interest. \"My mother was definitely an outsider and not shy about speaking about that. I felt like a New Yorker, but I knew there was another way of life.\" </p> <p>It is a perspective he values. When Duchovny won a scholarship to a prestigious prep school, he didn't establish himself as the loud kid or the show-off. He had skill on the sports field and, up until the end of high school his ambition was to become a professional athlete. But he was happier in the role of observer and it' i something he worries that success is denying him. \"As an actor and as a writer, I like to watch. But people become watchful when they come into contact with somebody famous. They don't act like themselves any more. It's sad. I can't complain about it, but I kind of miss... it is what it is.\" </p> <p>His watchfulness did not translate into infatuation or groupie-dom or any of the props of teenage identity crisis. The portrait Duchovny paints of his teenage self is of a boy as measured in his emotions as he is now, self-possessed, straightforward, so that you wonder where his private self is or what it would take to shake him out of composure. \"I kind of dreamed about being a famous athlete; not wanting to be famous but wanting to be good enough so that everybody knew who I was. But it wasn't fame for fame's sake. I didn't know what fame was really. I didn't know anyone famous; I didn't know any actors when I was growing up; I didn't understand what acting was. When I watched television I didn't think, I wonder what they do when they go home. I didn't want to read about them. I just watched TV. I never dreamed of shaking anyone's hand. Even with sports heroes, I liked watching them, I loved them from afar, but I didn't want to get to know them.\" </p> <p>When the X-Files became popular, its creator, Chris Carter, wanted to be photographed alongside the stars. Duchovny advised against it. \"I just said, you're so lucky, you're making money and you're creatively challenged, and you're doing what you want to do. Don't let go of your anonymity. People think that it's fun, but then there are repercussions.\" </p> <p>When he left school, Duchovny won a place at Princeton, and later a place to study for a masters degree in English literature at Yale, where he was taught by Harold Bloom. (\"I knew the work of Derrida and Paul de Man. It's like reading surgical text books. I know how to read them.\") He was a short way into a PhD thesis on magic and technology in contemporary poetry and prose, when he began acting to help fund his studies. At a friend's suggestion, he auditioned for and won the lead role in an advert for Lowenbrau beer. An agent spotted him and his career began. </p> <p>Writing is still a major interest. After years of making the X-Files, Duchovny was virtually on autopilot and revived his interest in the show by asking if he could have a go at writing an episode and if it was any good, directing it. To date, he has done two. His other passion, athletics, is something he still draws on as a metaphor for the challenges in his career. Of acting, he has said: \"It is not thinking, it is feeling. It is athletic, in the sense that it is instinctual. You can lose your self-consciousness, you become like an animal without notions of the past or the future. And that feels good.\" </p> <p>Minnie Driver is like a \"good tennis partner\", he says, always returning the ball. \"She is real quick and funny and game and she's real respectful. We got on really well.\" Appearing on confrontational US talk shows is like revving up for a football game: \"At first, when I did Letterman, it was like sports, it was terrifying and you'd come out of it and it was OK, it was a great achievement.\" </p> <p>Like a professional sportsman, articulating his personality is not a great priority. Near the end of the interview, however, a flash of something more interesting appears, calculated as a reward. \"My fear was that this could be a slushy movie,\" Duchovny says about Return to Me. \"There was a lot of anxiety. Even though I believed in it, it doesn't mean anything. It could still have been a piece of shit. It wasn't like I knew all along that this was the right tone. There were days when I thought, oh my god, I don't know whether what I'm doing is right or wrong for this movie, and I just agonised.\" Then, just as quickly, he is gone. </p> <p>\u0095 Return to Me is out on Friday.</p>",

Then, instead of taking a place at Christ Church, Oxford, he accepted an unpaid apprenticeship at Gaumont-British, and was sent to the Ufa studios in Babelsberg as a publicity writer and general assistant on the English version of a frothy operetta, Ich und die Kaiserin (The Only Girl), to be directed by Friedrich Hollaender, the composer for The Blue Angel and Congress Dances.</p> <p>To lower production costs and ensure the film an international market, German, French and English versions were shot simultaneously on the same sets - German in the morning, French in the afternoon, English in the evening. Dunbar was put to work as a dialogue coach to Lilian Harvey, one of the German leads. His other tasks involved entertaining visitors, and guiding the actor Ernest Thesiger round Berlin's homosexual night clubs.</p> <p>A month after the film opened in Germany, Hitler became chancellor and, along with other foreign film workers, Bob was expelled from the country. He returned to Gaumont-British and Gainsborough studios to take up modest duties as a scriptwriter, before becoming assistant director to the poet and film-maker Berthold Viertel on Little Friend. Dunbar was to co-write Viertel's next film, The Unchained Eagle, which depicted the poet Byron, not as a figure of sexual scandal but as a fighter for freedom. The studio head, Michael Balcon, concerned about the allusions to Hitler, consulted the Foreign Office and then rejected it.</p> <p>Within a year, Bob had moved to Alexander Korda's London Films, primarily as a production manager, working with Ren\u00e9 Clair on The Ghost Goes West and William Cameron Menzies on HG Wells's Things To Come, where his primary role was to keep the interfering author off the set by taking him for long walks around Denham studios.</p> <p>In 1937, with the near total collapse of British film production, Bob found it increasingly difficult to get work and, two years later, he took off for Hollywood, en route making a detour to Mexico, where he met his future wife, Tatiana, the daughter of elite Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. When the second world war broke out, he registered at the British consulate and they married. He was soon seconded to the Ministry of Information, and later moved to the Foreign Office as deputy head of the inter-allied information office in Mexico and the Caribbean.</p> <p>In November 1944, Bob was posted to Moscow in charge of press, public and cultural relations at the British embassy. He also edited a newspaper, British Ally. The film director Sergei Eisenstein would frequently dine at the Dunbars' rat-infested flat and, on one occasion, waited in the dark of the kitchen to catch a rodent, which he proudly presented on a covered dish.</p> <p>When the family returned to England in 1947, Bob contacted Alexander Korda, then producing Graham Greene's The Third Man. Carol Reed, its director, sent him from Vienna to Rome to persuade Orson Welles to play Harry Lime. Welles asked Bob how a person of \"such intellectual integrity could work for a fucking film company\" - but finally agreed an arrangement, which included two silk suits. Later, Bob produced a series of documentaries for Associated Rediffusion, half of which were to be directed by Welles, although, in the event, he failed to turn up.</p> <p>After a spell as production manager at Imperadio Pictures, Bob joined the founding father of British documentary films, John Grierson, as a producer at Group III, a film unit closely linked to the Association of Cinematographic Technicians (ACT), the then trade union of the industry. Michael Balcon, Group III's chairman, had sent Bob to invite Grierson to manage it. Group III took over a former Southall bus depot as a studio and produced some interesting projects, notably The Brave Don't Cry. But Group III quickly floundered. Bob considered that, in part, this was because Balcon, who was also head of Ealing Studios, forced scripts on it which Ealing had developed but not produced.</p> <p>After a spell making comedies for Hammer Films, including Life With The Lyons, Bob produced one of his best and most successful films, The Man Upstairs (1958), which was directed by Don Chaffey and starred Richard Attenborough, Bernard Lee and Donald Houston.</p> <p>With the industry in a continuous struggle for survival, he gradually moved towards teaching, first at a small art school in Brixton, south London, which he bought in 1957 and renamed the London School of Film Technique. Its success inspired the creation of numerous film schools throughout the country. In 1966, it became the London Film School, and still survives as the London International Film School.</p> <p>Bob was able to call on many young film directors - including Nicolas Roeg, Clive Donner and Charles Crichton - to teach there. Bob and Tatiana, who became the school's secretary, wanted it to become the National Film School, but this was vigorously opposed by the ACT general secretary, George Elvin, who believed that a state-maintained organisation was essential.</p> <p>In 1974, following Edward Heath's introduction of the three-day week, applications from abroad suddenly fell. Bob, who had never taken a salary, was forced out, and the school was taken over by a group that included many whom he had supported and helped over the years. Bob was not bitter, and maintained loyalty to friends and to the union.</p> <p>He spent his retirement going to film festivals and landscaping gardens for his friends. He was devoted to Tatiana and their four children, Marina, John, Jennifer and Margaret. He and Tat- iana were also legal guardians to Nicholas, the son John had with Marianne Faithfull.</p> <p>Robert Dunbar, film producer, writer, director and poet, born June 6 1914; died April 26 2000</p>",

After a spell as production manager at Imperadio Pictures, Bob joined the founding father of British documentary films, John Grierson, as a producer at Group III, a film unit closely linked to the Association of Cinematographic Technicians (ACT), the then trade union of the industry. Michael Balcon, Group III's chairman, had sent Bob to invite Grierson to manage it. Group III took over a former Southall bus depot as a studio and produced some interesting projects, notably The Brave Don't Cry. But Group III quickly floundered. Bob considered that, in part, this was because Balcon, who was also head of Ealing Studios, forced scripts on it which Ealing had developed but not produced. After a spell making comedies for Hammer Films, including Life With The Lyons, Bob produced one of his best and most successful films, The Man Upstairs (1958), which was directed by Don Chaffey and starred Richard Attenborough, Bernard Lee and Donald Houston. With the industry in a continuous struggle for survival, he gradually moved towards teaching, first at a small art school in Brixton, south London, which he bought in 1957 and renamed the London School of Film Technique. Its success inspired the creation of numerous film schools throughout the country. In 1966, it became the London Film School, and still survives as the London International Film School. Bob was able to call on many young film directors - including Nicolas Roeg, Clive Donner and Charles Crichton - to teach there. Bob and Tatiana, who became the school's secretary, wanted it to become the National Film School, but this was vigorously opposed by the ACT general secretary, George Elvin, who believed that a state-maintained organisation was essential. In 1974, following Edward Heath's introduction of the three-day week, applications from abroad suddenly fell. Bob, who had never taken a salary, was forced out, and the school was taken over by a group that included many whom he had supported and helped over the years. Bob was not bitter, and maintained loyalty to friends and to the union. He spent his retirement going to film festivals and landscaping gardens for his friends. He was devoted to Tatiana and their four children, Marina, John, Jennifer and Margaret. He and Tat- iana were also legal guardians to Nicholas, the son John had with Marianne Faithfull.
