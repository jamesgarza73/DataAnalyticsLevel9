      "body": "<p><strong> London Walking: A Handbook For Survival</strong> <br> Simon Pope <br>256pp, Ellipsis, \u00a310 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093509,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p><strong> Walking Literary London: 25 Original Walks Through London's Literary Heritage</strong> <br> Roger Tagholm <br>176pp, New Holland, \u00a39.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000352319,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p> Five minutes after finishing these books, on a winter lunchtime perfect for walking, I was halfway over a pedestrian crossing on my way out of central London when it became clear that the white van in the near distance was not going to stop. The sun caught its high sides as it crested the hill. The van was approaching fast enough to sway a little. </p> <p>But the road was straight. I was as easy to see as the van was. The driver slowed for a second, and looked at me through his dusty windscreen. His harassed deliveryman's eyes assessed the crossing. And then he accelerated. I had to stand very still to let him past. As he rattled off downhill in a slipstream of litter and exhaust fumes, another pedestrian, who had also been waiting to cross, caught my eye from the safety of the opposite kerb. There was a life of near-misses in his raised eyebrow. </p> <p>Walking in British cities is a mixed business. In some ways, it is increasingly encouraged, even mildly fashionable. The countryside is gated and poisonous, urban transport is clogged and unreliable; modern architects are in love with pedestrian schemes. Property developers heavily favour the phrase \"walking distance\". Meanwhile, writers such as Iain Sinclair have made the value of nosing around Britain's brick labyrinths into something close to an orthodoxy. The following manifesto of his from 1997, included in last year's Vintage Book of Walking edited by Duncan Minshull, could today come from an estate agent's catalogue: \"Walking is the best way to explore and exploit the city . . . Drifting purposefully is the recommended mode, trampling asphalted earth in alert reverie . . . noticing everything . Alignments of telephone kiosks, maps made from moss on the slopes of Victorian sepulchres . . .\" </p> <p>Yet while some people have been busily rediscovering this sort of pleasure, as old as the city itself, other people - a much greater number - have been driving around in their cars. Traffic in cities is getting heavier and more impatient. Deliveries are more frequent and more urgent. And developers, for all their talk of pedestrians, are still colonising pavements with their hoardings, blocking off river walks with their fortresses of apartments and attaching car parks to everything they can get away with. The air the urban walker breathes is exhaust and brickdust. The ground beneath his or her feet is uneven and ill-maintained. And then there's the dogshit, the trespassing cyclists . . . </p> <p>If you want to sense the British uncertainty about cities and how to use them - whether we want to be urban Europeans or suburban Americans; whether we can love gasometers and minicab offices as our national landscape as much as we used to love fields of cows - then you could try walking across a regenerated city centre such as Leeds or Hoxton in east London, and be half-murdered by their one-way systems. Or you could stay out of the rain, and read these books. Walking Literary London is the more traditional, and the more pessimistic: it presents the capital as a series of sights, with strolls kept to a minimum. \"The roar of traffic gets you down,\" Tagholm warns early on. His suggested routes twist nervously away from main roads and towards any green space available. He never mentions Sinclair; one of that author's favourite gothic East End flatlands is dismissed as merely \"a godforsaken place\". The guidebook prefers to spot Dickens landmarks and the \"former site of JM Dent Publishers\". </p> <p>Perhaps this is a rational response to the capital's present condition. But it feels a bit cowardly: there is an underground map on the inside cover for when the cracked pavements get too much. London Walking is altogether bolder. Part self-help book, part anti-car polemic, philosophy tract, trendy art spinoff and amateur work of sociology - and a satire, probably, of all of these - it celebrates strolling the same shabby alleys and high streets that Tagholm tries so hard to avoid. </p> <p>As with many walks, there is a certain amount of faffing around before we set off. The author describes himself as a slippery mixture of artist, lecturer, software designer and \"co-founder\" of something called \"Ice Cream for Everyone\", which turns out to be a sort of catering company with manifestos for London art parties. The first few pages of this tiny, heavily designed paperback are so busy with deadpan silliness that you wonder whether it is just a prank. \"How to recognise the kerb\", \"vital advice to consider before you cross a road\": the writing is mock-serious and relentlessly flat, with lots of lists and chapters in fragments, in the style of today's trendier young novelists. Pope's frame of reference wants to be cool, too. Hoxton Square and Bar Italia in Soho get namedropped; his bibliography proudly lists every vogueish wanderer's speculation on the capital, from Martin Amis's London Fields to a recent Historical Psychogeographical Report on Notting Hill ; there is much early showing off about \"liminal zones\" and London's \"lived experience\". </p> <p>But beneath the in-jokes, jargon and faux-na\u00eff sketches of paving slabs and which trainers to tread them with - all of which become quite addictive, as if Pope was the obsessive protagonist of some novel - a more universally applicable enthusiasm for snooping emerges. If country ramblers can play at being naturalists, why can't their urban counterparts pretend to be sociologists?

The sun caught its high sides as it crested the hill. The van was approaching fast enough to sway a little. But the road was straight. I was as easy to see as the van was. The driver slowed for a second, and looked at me through his dusty windscreen. His harassed deliveryman's eyes assessed the crossing. And then he accelerated. I had to stand very still to let him past. As he rattled off downhill in a slipstream of litter and exhaust fumes, another pedestrian, who had also been waiting to cross, caught my eye from the safety of the opposite kerb. There was a life of near-misses in his raised eyebrow. Walking in British cities is a mixed business. In some ways, it is increasingly encouraged, even mildly fashionable. The countryside is gated and poisonous, urban transport is clogged and unreliable; modern architects are in love with pedestrian schemes. Property developers heavily favour the phrase \"walking distance\". Meanwhile, writers such as Iain Sinclair have made the value of nosing around Britain's brick labyrinths into something close to an orthodoxy. The following manifesto of his from 1997, included in last year's Vintage Book of Walking edited by Duncan Minshull, could today come from an estate agent's catalogue: \"Walking is the best way to explore and exploit the city . . . Drifting purposefully is the recommended mode, trampling asphalted earth in alert reverie . . . noticing everything . Alignments of telephone kiosks, maps made from moss on the slopes of Victorian sepulchres . . .\" Yet while some people have been busily rediscovering this sort of pleasure, as old as the city itself, other people - a much greater number - have been driving around in their cars. Traffic in cities is getting heavier and more impatient. Deliveries are more frequent and more urgent. And developers, for all their talk of pedestrians, are still colonising pavements with their hoardings, blocking off river walks with their fortresses of apartments and attaching car parks to everything they can get away with. The air the urban walker breathes is exhaust and brickdust. The ground beneath his or her feet is uneven and ill-maintained. And then there's the dogshit, the trespassing cyclists . . . If you want to sense the British uncertainty about cities and how to use them - whether we want to be urban Europeans or suburban Americans; whether we can love gasometers and minicab offices as our national landscape as much as we used to love fields of cows - then you could try walking across a regenerated city centre such as Leeds or Hoxton in east London, and be half-murdered by their one-way systems. Or you could stay out of the rain, and read these books. Walking Literary London is the more traditional, and the more pessimistic: it presents the capital as a series of sights, with strolls kept to a minimum. \"The roar of traffic gets you down,\" Tagholm warns early on. His suggested routes twist nervously away from main roads and towards any green space available. He never mentions Sinclair; one of that author's favourite gothic East End flatlands is dismissed as merely \"a godforsaken place\". The guidebook prefers to spot Dickens landmarks and the \"former site of JM Dent Publishers\". Perhaps this is a rational response to the capital's present condition. But it feels a bit cowardly: there is an underground map on the inside cover for when the cracked pavements get too much. London Walking is altogether bolder. Part self-help book, part anti-car polemic, philosophy tract, trendy art spinoff and amateur work of sociology - and a satire, probably, of all of these - it celebrates strolling the same shabby alleys and high streets that Tagholm tries so hard to avoid. As with many walks, there is a certain amount of faffing around before we set off. The author describes himself as a slippery mixture of artist, lecturer, software designer and \"co-founder\" of something called \"Ice Cream for Everyone\", which turns out to be a sort of catering company with manifestos for London art parties. The first few pages of this tiny, heavily designed paperback are so busy with deadpan silliness that you wonder whether it is just a prank. \"How to recognise the kerb\", \"vital advice to consider before you cross a road\": the writing is mock-serious and relentlessly flat, with lots of lists and chapters in fragments, in the style of today's trendier young novelists. Pope's frame of reference wants to be cool, too. Hoxton Square and Bar Italia in Soho get namedropped; his bibliography proudly lists every vogueish wanderer's speculation on the capital, from Martin Amis's London Fields to a recent Historical Psychogeographical Report on Notting Hill ; there is much early showing off about \"liminal zones\" and London's \"lived experience\". But beneath the in-jokes, jargon and faux-na\u00eff sketches of paving slabs and which trainers to tread them with - all of which become quite addictive, as if Pope was the obsessive protagonist of some novel - a more universally applicable enthusiasm for snooping emerges. If country ramblers can play at being naturalists, why can't their urban counterparts pretend to be sociologists? Pope suggests judging areas by dropped sweet wrappers, offers tips for looking over fences, and gives droll warnings: \"Beware The White Van Bearing Gifts\". And then, 90 pages in, he and a friend set out across London. They start in windswept Canning Town, way out to the east, on a freezing December morning. The idea is to reach west London by nightfall. It is too cold and dark to do anything but set off, so they head into the wind. At first, the scenery seems bleak to Pope's sharp metropolitan eye: \"On the south side of the road, a recently built 'call centre'. This could be any other province: Wales, Scotland . . .\" Then the cold air, the low sun and the rhythm of feet on concrete begin to intoxicate. His writing loses its jerky cleverness for a calmer forward motion. \"We could make it as far as Reading by sunset,\" Pope declares grandly after stopping for breakfast. Walking can encourage delusions. The Vintage anthology, which is honest and eclectic enough to include embarrassments, has several examples of Bruce Chatwin at his baggiest, speculating unconvincingly about all people being natural nomads - the hoped-for great theory that the great travel writer endlessly and vainly spent his journeys refining, but never managed to publish. A melancholy extract from the German sociologist Walter Benjamin points out that urban walking, for all its pretensions to free-thinking and independence, is often dependent for points of interest on passing shops, billboards and other traces of the consumer capitalism it claims to spurn.

      "bodyText": "An \u00a38m seven floor London \"superclub\" that opened with hopes of becoming the best dance venue in the world was ordered to close yesterday amid police claims that it has a serious drug problem. The decision to revoke the music and dance licence of Leicester Square nightclub Home was taken by Westminster city council during an emergency session in which detectives claimed ecstasy was being given away free at the club, and that staff had ignored repeated warnings to tighten up security. Although class A drug dealing was taking place openly at Home, staff had managed to make only 74 seizures in the past seven months, the police report said. Yet at Heaven, another London nightclub with a smaller capacity, staff had managed 945 seizures over the same period. The move to close Home, which has a capacity of 2,500, has come 18 months after an opening night attended by Brad Pitt and Whitney Houston, and a publicity blitz which claimed it would take the capital's clubland by storm. With three dance floors, a private members' bar and restaurant, and boasting \"cutting edge modern design with 21st century technological chutzpah\", the club hoped to appeal to everyone. Although there were rumours that Home had not pulled in the crowds it had hoped for, the club had signed major DJs, including Paul Oakenfold and Dope Smugglaz, and had sets broadcast live on Radio 1. Among the regular guests, however, were undercover officers from Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit, who were more concerned with the level of drug dealing than the quality of the music. One ecstasy supplier was arrested by detectives last December, and warning letters were sent to the manager. Officers gave a talk to security staff on February 8, and returned undercover the following night to find nothing had changed. One dealer had offered the detectives free sample pills. Police were also astonished that only six people had been caught by staff and subsequently arrested for drug possession over the past seven months, even though the club has a closed circuit TV system. Deputy assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur wrote to the council warning that \"Home has a serious drug problem and there is no evidence of vigorous or effective security, despite repeated and continuing police advice .. the management seems to have scant regard of their responsibilities to self-police their premises in so far as drugs are concerned\". Chief Inspector Chris Bradford said yesterday: \"Our actions should act as a warning to other premises. We are prepared to take every step in our power to solve the problem.\" Westminster's licensing sub-committee agreed to revoke the club's licence \"in the interests of public safety\". \"There was clear evidence of open drug dealing at the club,\" said Carl Powell, director of planning and transportation. \"The decision to revoke the licence was not taken lightly.

Ron McCulloch, the owner of Home, said: \"The decision is incredible. The police are making an example of us. We have one of the best records of any club in the country for helping the police do their job and having a hard anti-drugs policy. \"The action is unwarranted in my view.

The firm made a pretax loss of \u00a325.4m last year. Napp fined for drug discount Napp Pharmaceuticals was fined \u00a33.2m in a ruling by the office of fair trading. Cambridge-based Napp was accused of supplying a morphine product to patients at excessively high prices while discounting the product for hospitals in a way that blocked competition. Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers described the ruling as an \"important milestone in UK competition history\". Champion performance The owner of Leeds United football club last night reported a 67% jump in half-year turnover after the team's strong performance in the European Champions League. Leeds Sporting said operating profit had more than doubled to \u00a36.2m, but pretax profits fell from \u00a35m to \u00a395,000 owing to fewer sales of players.

      "body": "<p>Kevin Maxwell kept us waiting outside his office for well over an hour. His secretary apologised repeatedly, in a manner suggesting that this happened all the time. At last her boss emerged to shake our hands perfunctorily and to confirm that he was giving Thornton Investment Managers the mandate to manage \u00a310m of the Mirror Group pension fund. </p> <p>Within 30 seconds he was gone. I'd not met him before and I have not met him since. But I've not forgotten. </p> <p>A year or so later I took a call from one of Mr Maxwell's staff to tell me that he was withdrawing our mandate as the Mirror had lost confidence in our investment style. I was mortified. Its portfolio's performance had been fine, and 12 months counts as very short term in the world of pension fund management. </p> <p>It was only as the Mirror Group empire imploded in the aftermath of Robert Maxwell's death that all became clear. When the charges were prepared for the court case in which Kevin and Ian Maxwell were eventually acquitted, one related to improper use of the slice of the Mirror pension fund that my firm had so briefly managed. I've often wondered why we were prepared to take on Mirror's business at the time. Our misgivings went much deeper than Kevin Maxwell's apparent lack of social graces. </p> <p>The pension fund's administrators, on the Maxwell payroll, chose not to use a custodian bank to hold its investments. Instead they kept all records, and share certificates, themselves. This was a highly unusual arrangement. In retrospect it is easy to see how the fund's assets could be diverted in an attempt to shore up the Maxwell family's crumbling empire. </p> <p>So why did we make such a monumental misjudgment of character? In part it was to please our chairman, Lord Walker - an appointee of our parent, Dresdner Bank and the source of our introduction to Kevin Maxwell. In part, also, it was the charm of his underlings. But most important, I guess, was a natural desire to further our own business. </p> <p>I was reminded of these salutary lessons of a decade past by two incidents this week. One, obviously, was the publication of the Department of Trade &amp; Industry report into the conduct of Robert Maxwell's business affairs - no surprises there, on my first swift perusal. </p> <p>The other was a meeting with colleagues to decide whether or not to take on a potential new corporate client. One of our team expressed concerns about the company's management, but couldn't quite articulate what made him feel uncomfortable. My colleague came under some pressure to explain what for him was essentially a gut feeling. It was easy to see both sides of the debate. A logical examination of the available facts gave one answer; one man's hunch another. </p> <p>The financial world has been lucky not to be cursed by the cult of celebrity. I bumped into a literary agent this week who insisted that, contrary to charges laid against her profession, the photogenic quality of authors is not a determinant of publishing rosters. \"I didn't know what Robert Ludlum looked like until I read his obit.\" </p> <p>The same can be said of commerce.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Maxwell kept us waiting outside his office for well over an hour. His secretary apologised repeatedly, in a manner suggesting that this happened all the time. At last her boss emerged to shake our hands perfunctorily and to confirm that he was giving Thornton Investment Managers the mandate to manage \u00a310m of the Mirror Group pension fund. Within 30 seconds he was gone. I'd not met him before and I have not met him since. But I've not forgotten. A year or so later I took a call from one of Mr Maxwell's staff to tell me that he was withdrawing our mandate as the Mirror had lost confidence in our investment style. I was mortified. Its portfolio's performance had been fine, and 12 months counts as very short term in the world of pension fund management. It was only as the Mirror Group empire imploded in the aftermath of Robert Maxwell's death that all became clear. When the charges were prepared for the court case in which Kevin and Ian Maxwell were eventually acquitted, one related to improper use of the slice of the Mirror pension fund that my firm had so briefly managed. I've often wondered why we were prepared to take on Mirror's business at the time. Our misgivings went much deeper than Kevin Maxwell's apparent lack of social graces. The pension fund's administrators, on the Maxwell payroll, chose not to use a custodian bank to hold its investments. Instead they kept all records, and share certificates, themselves. This was a highly unusual arrangement. In retrospect it is easy to see how the fund's assets could be diverted in an attempt to shore up the Maxwell family's crumbling empire. So why did we make such a monumental misjudgment of character? In part it was to please our chairman, Lord Walker - an appointee of our parent, Dresdner Bank and the source of our introduction to Kevin Maxwell. In part, also, it was the charm of his underlings. But most important, I guess, was a natural desire to further our own business. I was reminded of these salutary lessons of a decade past by two incidents this week. One, obviously, was the publication of the Department of Trade &amp; Industry report into the conduct of Robert Maxwell's business affairs - no surprises there, on my first swift perusal. The other was a meeting with colleagues to decide whether or not to take on a potential new corporate client. One of our team expressed concerns about the company's management, but couldn't quite articulate what made him feel uncomfortable. My colleague came under some pressure to explain what for him was essentially a gut feeling. It was easy to see both sides of the debate. A logical examination of the available facts gave one answer; one man's hunch another. The financial world has been lucky not to be cursed by the cult of celebrity. I bumped into a literary agent this week who insisted that, contrary to charges laid against her profession, the photogenic quality of authors is not a determinant of publishing rosters. \"I didn't know what Robert Ludlum looked like until I read his obit.\" The same can be said of commerce. Few industrialists are household names - old stagers such as Richard Branson and Anita Roddick, and parvenus such as Hans Snook, are the exceptions. The same is true of investment managers. Rarely do they make the front pages. One remembers Nicola Horlick storming the Deutsche Bank bastion in Frankfurt, the cross-dressing David Young in the dock, and, this week, the departure of one of the greatest names of British fund management, Carol Galley. The confinement of professional investors and captains of industry to the financial pages must be a good thing. When their personality transcends their performance then the system is at risk of distortion. This is not a charge that could be levelled at Ms Galley, and it is fitting that she should make headlines only on stepping down. Fund managers, half-jokingly, cite warning signals of impending megalomania among industrialists - the fountain in the lobby, or the corporate jet. These are unlikely to unearth fraud, however, merely overweening ambition. A more practical safeguard against megalomania and malpractice is the pressure exerted by investors to ensure that corporate boards are correctly balanced - in particular, that the chairman and chief executive are not the same individual. Many leading companies continue to re sist this pressure - misguidedly in my view - but the debate alone is a healthy sign that corporate governance is near the top of the agenda for companies and their shareholders alike. Little can be done, however, to avert sustained, wilful wrongdoing, especially if it is undertaken with intelligence, daring and a complete absence of conscience. Which leaves the whole system critically reliant on character judgments and gut feelings.

      "byline": "Julia Finch, City editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stephen Marks is making a fortune out of the f-word. Not the expletive, but \"fcuk\" - a clever and coincidental trademark and anagram. He has plastered the country with the nudge-nudge four letter logo on adverts as controversial, and publicity-generating, as Benetton in its heyday. The logo is a masterpiece of branding that has helped transform the 25-year-old French Connection from just another shop to an international name. </p> <p>The naughty label has not done all the work - the clothes are suitably edgy and spot-on their target market in quality and price, while the stores are light, bright and sharp. But the f-word has more than done its job. </p> <p>Since 1997, when the first fcuk campaign was launched, French Connection's profits have soared from \u00a36.4m to \u00a319m and its share price has rocketed from around 300p to 775p. Mr Marks' 61% stake in the company is now worth some \u00a390m. </p> <p>The fcuk brand was dreamed up in-house. The company used to send faxes back and forth between its London and Hong Kong offices using the abbreviations FCUK and FCHK. \"There was no thought of it being rude,\" insists Mr Marks, but advertising executive Trevor Beattie picked up on the abbreviation and came up with the \"fcuk fashion\" slogan. </p> <p>\"I thought it was bloody marvellous,\" say Mr Marks. \"We didn't even have an advertising budget at that time, but within four weeks we had the posters up and the rest is history.\" </p> <p>The hidden expletive has caused a good deal of huffing and puffing from self-appointed moral guardians and advertising watchdogs. The latest run-in with the authorities, last month, centred on the \"fcukinkybugger\" campaign, which Mr Marks had hoped to put on TV. </p> <p>The ads feature a couple peeling off their clothes and use straplines like \"full frontal collision until knackered\" and \"forefinger carefully undoing kecks\". </p> <p>The advertising watchdogs were having none of it. Not only did the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, which vets TV commercials, highlight the \"unacceptable level of innuendo,\" it also went on to say it was shocked the company \"had the gall to send the script in\". </p> <p>Resultant publicity probably caused almost as much of a furore as the advert would have generated and it is running on the company website, with useful pointers in the shop windows for anyone in need of a bit of forbidden titillation. </p> <p>Mr Marks - casual in jeans, fleece and leather and with a trim beard - feigns surprise at the reaction. \"It sounds crazy, but it wasn't the intention to push the limits of acceptability. To us (the phrase) kinky bugger is the same as cheeky monkey. Had I thought about it meaning anal sex I wouldn't have done it. In retrospect we should have changed it.\" </p> <p>That doesn't reconcile with his other, more strident, views about his advertising. \"If people think that sex doesn't sell then they are living in the stone age. My audience is 18-30s and I'm not upsetting them.\" </p> <p>Indeed not. He has sold 1m T-shirts emblazoned \"fcuk\" at \u00a320 a throw. \"The people I am upsetting are not my customers,\" he adds. \"Take Lynda Lee-Potter. She said she would never wear any of our clothes again. Well I say: 'Thank God for that'.\" </p> <p>Is he not concerned about parents facing awkward questions from their children about the more raunchy billboards? \"That's their problem. I'm pushing my clothes. My daughter is six and is learning to read. She thinks it says F-cuck\". </p> <p><strong> 'The Hotpants King'</strong><br> </p> <p> Born and brought up in Harrow in north London, Mr Marks, now 54, has spent most of his life in the rag trade. Had he been born a few years later it could all have been so different. His first love was tennis and in 1964 he won the plate at Junior Wimbledon. But the game was still amateur, \"and I had to earn a living, so I went to work for a coat manufacturer. They gave me the most wonderful training, although I didn't realise it at the time, learning about everything from cloth buying to designing.\" </p> <p>He joined Louis Feraud to launch a Miss Feraud label. When the collection succeeded he was offered a directorship. \"I asked if that meant I got a share of the company and they said: 'No, you just get called a director.' That made me very depressed, because I wanted to get on in life. I didn't care what I was called.\" </p> <p>A friend, who was willing to provide backing, suggested he go it alone. His first success was with an unforgettable fad. </p> <p>\"I was in Paris and saw some hotpants. I came back to London, had some run up and showed them to a buyer at Miss Selfridge. She took 36 pairs and sold them all in a day. She came back for 2,000 pairs and I became the Hotpants King.\" </p> <p>His next venture was his own label, making coats and suits. By year three he was racking up sales of \u00a3700,000 \"and I thought I must be doing something right here\". </p> <p>In 1972, he volunteered to go to Hong Kong to sort out a business problem for a friend. \"Once I saw Hong Kong I realised the potential of the far east. It was like a shining light in terms of price and quality. And so French Connection was born.\" </p> <p>His first order was for cheesecloth shirts. \"I ordered half long-sleeved and half short-sleeved. When they arrived they were a lovely black, white and red - but they all had one short sleeve and one long. But we cut off all the long sleeves and they sold out.\" </p> <p>His first shop, in London's Walton Street, stocked cane furniture and cheesecloth and was called Cane. The second, in South Molton Street, was called Friends. French Connection - a name \"thought up in a car parked at the back of the Palladium\" - started trading in the late 1970s with one outlet inside Top Shop. </p> <p>Today French Connection has 65 UK stores, plus an equal number of concessions in larger stores, and 25 in the US. Mr Marks believes there is potential for 300 in the US and will soon open his first outlet in Japan. </p> <p>French Connection is not his only fashion interest. At the top end of the market he also controls the Nicole Farhi label. In the 1970s Mr Marks and Ms Farhi were an item. But \"she was always criticising my designs and saying she could do better. So in the end I said 'bloody get on with it then', and she did.\" </p> <p>The couple had a baby - a daughter now aged 25 - \"but after 15 years we went our separate ways\". They still work together - he masterminds the development of her brand and her stores, including a New York store and a new one being planned for San Francisco - and they get on \"just like we always did\". </p> <p>He is now married with two young children, and another due in May, to Alisa, a former Elle fashion editor who now works at French Connection's headquarters in the heart of the West End rag trade, north of Oxford Street. </p> <p>Even some of his pastimes are profitable. With a friend he put up \u00a3600,000 to co-finance the Guy Ritchie movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He then backed its sequel, Snatch. </p> <p>The company is producing growth - sales up 24% last year - and is planning a new fragrance, a range of homewares and - it is a surprise he hasn't done it before - an Fcuk condom. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer can only dream of such performance. Mr Marks says he doesn't like to criticise anyone in the fashion business. He makes an exception for the ailing M&amp;S. \"They need a revolution and someone who understands product.\" </p> <p>Much of the problem, he fears, comes from lack of leadership. \"In other companies, people are more interested in their titles and where they sit than what is in the shop. If you are not passionate, why bother? I love what I do and we do the best we can. But then I'm not your normal businessman.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stephen Marks is making a fortune out of the f-word. Not the expletive, but \"fcuk\" - a clever and coincidental trademark and anagram. He has plastered the country with the nudge-nudge four letter logo on adverts as controversial, and publicity-generating, as Benetton in its heyday. The logo is a masterpiece of branding that has helped transform the 25-year-old French Connection from just another shop to an international name. The naughty label has not done all the work - the clothes are suitably edgy and spot-on their target market in quality and price, while the stores are light, bright and sharp. But the f-word has more than done its job. Since 1997, when the first fcuk campaign was launched, French Connection's profits have soared from \u00a36.4m to \u00a319m and its share price has rocketed from around 300p to 775p. Mr Marks' 61% stake in the company is now worth some \u00a390m. The fcuk brand was dreamed up in-house. The company used to send faxes back and forth between its London and Hong Kong offices using the abbreviations FCUK and FCHK. \"There was no thought of it being rude,\" insists Mr Marks, but advertising executive Trevor Beattie picked up on the abbreviation and came up with the \"fcuk fashion\" slogan. \"I thought it was bloody marvellous,\" say Mr Marks. \"We didn't even have an advertising budget at that time, but within four weeks we had the posters up and the rest is history.\" The hidden expletive has caused a good deal of huffing and puffing from self-appointed moral guardians and advertising watchdogs. The latest run-in with the authorities, last month, centred on the \"fcukinkybugger\" campaign, which Mr Marks had hoped to put on TV. The ads feature a couple peeling off their clothes and use straplines like \"full frontal collision until knackered\" and \"forefinger carefully undoing kecks\". The advertising watchdogs were having none of it. Not only did the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, which vets TV commercials, highlight the \"unacceptable level of innuendo,\" it also went on to say it was shocked the company \"had the gall to send the script in\". Resultant publicity probably caused almost as much of a furore as the advert would have generated and it is running on the company website, with useful pointers in the shop windows for anyone in need of a bit of forbidden titillation. Mr Marks - casual in jeans, fleece and leather and with a trim beard - feigns surprise at the reaction. \"It sounds crazy, but it wasn't the intention to push the limits of acceptability. To us (the phrase) kinky bugger is the same as cheeky monkey. Had I thought about it meaning anal sex I wouldn't have done it. In retrospect we should have changed it.\" That doesn't reconcile with his other, more strident, views about his advertising. \"If people think that sex doesn't sell then they are living in the stone age. My audience is 18-30s and I'm not upsetting them.\" Indeed not. He has sold 1m T-shirts emblazoned \"fcuk\" at \u00a320 a throw. \"The people I am upsetting are not my customers,\" he adds. \"Take Lynda Lee-Potter. She said she would never wear any of our clothes again. Well I say: 'Thank God for that'.\" Is he not concerned about parents facing awkward questions from their children about the more raunchy billboards? \"That's their problem. I'm pushing my clothes. My daughter is six and is learning to read. She thinks it says F-cuck\". 'The Hotpants King' Born and brought up in Harrow in north London, Mr Marks, now 54, has spent most of his life in the rag trade. Had he been born a few years later it could all have been so different. His first love was tennis and in 1964 he won the plate at Junior Wimbledon. But the game was still amateur, \"and I had to earn a living, so I went to work for a coat manufacturer. They gave me the most wonderful training, although I didn't realise it at the time, learning about everything from cloth buying to designing.\" He joined Louis Feraud to launch a Miss Feraud label. When the collection succeeded he was offered a directorship. \"I asked if that meant I got a share of the company and they said: 'No, you just get called a director.' That made me very depressed, because I wanted to get on in life. I didn't care what I was called.\" A friend, who was willing to provide backing, suggested he go it alone. His first success was with an unforgettable fad. \"I was in Paris and saw some hotpants. I came back to London, had some run up and showed them to a buyer at Miss Selfridge. She took 36 pairs and sold them all in a day. She came back for 2,000 pairs and I became the Hotpants King.\" His next venture was his own label, making coats and suits. By year three he was racking up sales of \u00a3700,000 \"and I thought I must be doing something right here\". In 1972, he volunteered to go to Hong Kong to sort out a business problem for a friend. \"Once I saw Hong Kong I realised the potential of the far east. It was like a shining light in terms of price and quality. And so French Connection was born.\" His first order was for cheesecloth shirts. \"I ordered half long-sleeved and half short-sleeved. When they arrived they were a lovely black, white and red - but they all had one short sleeve and one long. But we cut off all the long sleeves and they sold out.\" His first shop, in London's Walton Street, stocked cane furniture and cheesecloth and was called Cane. The second, in South Molton Street, was called Friends. French Connection - a name \"thought up in a car parked at the back of the Palladium\" - started trading in the late 1970s with one outlet inside Top Shop. Today French Connection has 65 UK stores, plus an equal number of concessions in larger stores, and 25 in the US. Mr Marks believes there is potential for 300 in the US and will soon open his first outlet in Japan. French Connection is not his only fashion interest. At the top end of the market he also controls the Nicole Farhi label. In the 1970s Mr Marks and Ms Farhi were an item. But \"she was always criticising my designs and saying she could do better. So in the end I said 'bloody get on with it then', and she did.\" The couple had a baby - a daughter now aged 25 - \"but after 15 years we went our separate ways\". They still work together - he masterminds the development of her brand and her stores, including a New York store and a new one being planned for San Francisco - and they get on \"just like we always did\". He is now married with two young children, and another due in May, to Alisa, a former Elle fashion editor who now works at French Connection's headquarters in the heart of the West End rag trade, north of Oxford Street. Even some of his pastimes are profitable. With a friend he put up \u00a3600,000 to co-finance the Guy Ritchie movie Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He then backed its sequel, Snatch. The company is producing growth - sales up 24% last year - and is planning a new fragrance, a range of homewares and - it is a surprise he hasn't done it before - an Fcuk condom. Marks &amp; Spencer can only dream of such performance. Mr Marks says he doesn't like to criticise anyone in the fashion business. He makes an exception for the ailing M&amp;S. \"They need a revolution and someone who understands product.\" Much of the problem, he fears, comes from lack of leadership. \"In other companies, people are more interested in their titles and where they sit than what is in the shop. If you are not passionate, why bother? I love what I do and we do the best we can. But then I'm not your normal businessman.\"",

      "byline": "Andrew Clark",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Within minutes of taking ownership of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1984, Robert Maxwell made it clear who was boss. The Czech-born farm labourer's son arrived at the company's offices at midnight and convened a board meeting at 2.45am. </p> <p>At that meeting, he demanded a change in the company's mandates allowing him to sign cheques or make transfers of the Mirror Group's money, based on his sole signature, for any amount. </p> <p>In a departure from their usual legalistic language, the Department of Trade and Industry's inspectors describe Maxwell as a \"bully and a domineering personality\". Their 374-page report details the failure of anyone around him to keep him in check. </p> <p>Maxwell bought the Mirror Group from Reed International for \u00a3113m, as part of his stated ambition to build a global communications company with revenues of \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn - he wanted to be a media baron to rival Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>He quickly restored the business's profitability by ending restrictive labour practices. But, by 1986, there were signs of trouble ahead - when the Mirror Group needed \u00a334m cash, Maxwell \"borrowed\" the money from the firm's pension fund in return for shares that the firm held in Reuters. When these shares were transferred back in 1989, the fund made a significant loss on the transaction. </p> <p>This pattern of plundering the pension fund became common practice. At a meeting with trade unions, Maxwell once referred to \"his\" fund. When this was queried by union officials, he turned to his company secretary and demanded who owned the pension trustee company. He was told that it was ultimately held by his private firm Pergamon Press, as parent company of the Mirror. Maxwell said: \"Exactly. So I own the pension scheme.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of the 1980s, Maxwell's financial position deteriorated as he bor rowed money for increasingly expensive acquisitions - including Quebecor Printing, Donohue and AGB Research. By 1989, Maxwell's private businesses owed nearly \u00a31bn and his listed vehicle, Maxwell Communications Corporation, had debts of \u00a32bn. </p> <p>When recession bit in 1990, he faced a squeeze to keep up repayments. So he decided to float a 49% stake in Mirror Group - a move that eventually raised \u00a3235m from the public and from institutions. </p> <p>A list of blue-chip advisers agreed to advise on the flotation - including stockbroker Samuel Montagu, investment bank Goldman Sachs and accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The DTI inspectors express surprise at their willingness, given that Maxwell had been branded unfit to \"exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company\" in a DTI investigation in the 1970s. </p> <p>They comment that there was no evidence Maxwell had \"changed his spots\", adding that there was no justification for acting towards him \"without a high degree of circumspection and care\". </p> <p>The prospectus for the flotation, the inspectors find, was \"materially inaccurate and misleading\" - it did not reveal the true reason for the offering, which was to provide cash and publicly quoted shares for use in bailing out the rest of Maxwell's business empire. </p> <p>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the Mirror Group's auditor, told the DTI it watched Maxwell \"like a hawk\", placing him in the highest category of difficult clients. But the inspectors point out that the firm's \"limited review\" entirely missed the \"serious financial position\" of his \"private side\". </p> <p><strong> No checks</strong><br> </p> <p> Once Mirror Group became a private company, there was no effective \"ring fence\" to keep a check on Maxwell's use of its cashflow. There was an ineffectual performance from heavyweight non-executive directors such as former TSB chairman Sir Robert Clark and former attorney-general Lord Williams of Elvel. </p> <p>A typical incident concerned a board meeting to approve the company's half-year results in July 1991. Robert Maxwell changed the date of the meeting at the last minute, with the result that six senior directors could not attend. No papers were made available to board members in advance, the discussion was \"brief\" and none of those present objected to the way the meeting was arranged or conducted. Maxwell's right-hand man was his son, Kevin, whose business ethics were learnt from his father and whose conduct is condemned in the report as \"inexcusable\". </p> <p>In September and October 1991, Maxwell borrowed \u00a380m from banks as pressure from his struggling private businesses became acute. This was partly through a series of foreign-exchange transactions - Mirror Group settled each one a few days late, so that each transaction was effectively a short-term loan. </p> <p>To sustain his ballooning overdrafts, Maxwell offered the banks Mirror shares as security. But he became agitated as the share price fell, devaluing this \"currency\". </p> <p>Maxwell wanted to buy Mirror Group shares to try to support the price. But at the flotation, he had given an undertaking to Samuel Montagu that he would not do so. To avoid this, he arranged for purchases in the names of a series of related companies. The purchase of \u00a326m of Mirror shares was carried out by Eric Sheinberg, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, who comes in for severe criticism for failing to ask questions. The inspectors say: \"Mr Sheinberg must have come to appreciate in due course that Maxwell was in fact the purchaser.\" </p> <p>Over the course of 1990 and 1991, Maxwell spent \u00a3344m on buying shares in Mirror Group and his other quoted vehicle, Maxwell Communications Corporation. His borrowings became so acute that he pledged his entire 51% stake in the Mirror Group to banks as security for loans. </p> <p>In August 1991, the position became unsustainable. Maxwell's lenders were hav ing doubts. NatWest, for instance, felt he was becoming \"unpredictable\" and believed he had not dealt \"fully and frankly\" with the bank. </p> <p><strong> First sign</strong><br> </p> <p> On August 12, Maxwell phoned Sheinberg and admitted he could not repay a $35m loan from Goldman Sachs that was due the next day. This was the first time he had reneged on a such a deal. Goldman was obliged by Stock Exchange rules to announce that it had a claim over 10% of Mirror Group and 4.8% of Maxwell Communications. </p> <p>This was the first public sign that Maxwell was in trouble. US bank Lehman Brothers demanded repayment of several large loans shortly afterwards. Maxwell obtained short-term help of \u00a350m from Bankers Trust, but he also began selling his treasured stakes in a series of promising Israeli companies. </p> <p>Spotting these transactions, Goldman concluded that Maxwell was in trouble, and lost hope of any repayment of its loans. It decided to sell the Mirror Group shares that Maxwell had offered as security - a move which would signal to other banks that it considered him a bad risk. </p> <p>On November 4, a senior Goldman executive telephoned Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, to inform him that these sales were imminent. </p> <p>Maxwell had been monitoring these events from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine. In the early hours of November 5, he disappeared overboard. His death was announced that afternoon to Mirror Group's board, which asked the Stock Exchange to suspend dealing in the company's shares. </p> <p>Maxwell's sons, Kevin and Ian, were left in charge as the Maxwell empire unravelled with frightening speed. Within weeks, huge shortfalls in the Mirror Group's pension fund emerged, and the Serious Fraud Office began the task of unpicking Maxwell's tangled financial web.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Within minutes of taking ownership of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1984, Robert Maxwell made it clear who was boss. The Czech-born farm labourer's son arrived at the company's offices at midnight and convened a board meeting at 2.45am. At that meeting, he demanded a change in the company's mandates allowing him to sign cheques or make transfers of the Mirror Group's money, based on his sole signature, for any amount. In a departure from their usual legalistic language, the Department of Trade and Industry's inspectors describe Maxwell as a \"bully and a domineering personality\". Their 374-page report details the failure of anyone around him to keep him in check. Maxwell bought the Mirror Group from Reed International for \u00a3113m, as part of his stated ambition to build a global communications company with revenues of \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn - he wanted to be a media baron to rival Rupert Murdoch. He quickly restored the business's profitability by ending restrictive labour practices. But, by 1986, there were signs of trouble ahead - when the Mirror Group needed \u00a334m cash, Maxwell \"borrowed\" the money from the firm's pension fund in return for shares that the firm held in Reuters. When these shares were transferred back in 1989, the fund made a significant loss on the transaction. This pattern of plundering the pension fund became common practice. At a meeting with trade unions, Maxwell once referred to \"his\" fund. When this was queried by union officials, he turned to his company secretary and demanded who owned the pension trustee company. He was told that it was ultimately held by his private firm Pergamon Press, as parent company of the Mirror. Maxwell said: \"Exactly. So I own the pension scheme.\" Towards the end of the 1980s, Maxwell's financial position deteriorated as he bor rowed money for increasingly expensive acquisitions - including Quebecor Printing, Donohue and AGB Research. By 1989, Maxwell's private businesses owed nearly \u00a31bn and his listed vehicle, Maxwell Communications Corporation, had debts of \u00a32bn. When recession bit in 1990, he faced a squeeze to keep up repayments. So he decided to float a 49% stake in Mirror Group - a move that eventually raised \u00a3235m from the public and from institutions. A list of blue-chip advisers agreed to advise on the flotation - including stockbroker Samuel Montagu, investment bank Goldman Sachs and accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The DTI inspectors express surprise at their willingness, given that Maxwell had been branded unfit to \"exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company\" in a DTI investigation in the 1970s. They comment that there was no evidence Maxwell had \"changed his spots\", adding that there was no justification for acting towards him \"without a high degree of circumspection and care\". The prospectus for the flotation, the inspectors find, was \"materially inaccurate and misleading\" - it did not reveal the true reason for the offering, which was to provide cash and publicly quoted shares for use in bailing out the rest of Maxwell's business empire. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the Mirror Group's auditor, told the DTI it watched Maxwell \"like a hawk\", placing him in the highest category of difficult clients. But the inspectors point out that the firm's \"limited review\" entirely missed the \"serious financial position\" of his \"private side\". No checks Once Mirror Group became a private company, there was no effective \"ring fence\" to keep a check on Maxwell's use of its cashflow. There was an ineffectual performance from heavyweight non-executive directors such as former TSB chairman Sir Robert Clark and former attorney-general Lord Williams of Elvel. A typical incident concerned a board meeting to approve the company's half-year results in July 1991. Robert Maxwell changed the date of the meeting at the last minute, with the result that six senior directors could not attend. No papers were made available to board members in advance, the discussion was \"brief\" and none of those present objected to the way the meeting was arranged or conducted. Maxwell's right-hand man was his son, Kevin, whose business ethics were learnt from his father and whose conduct is condemned in the report as \"inexcusable\". In September and October 1991, Maxwell borrowed \u00a380m from banks as pressure from his struggling private businesses became acute. This was partly through a series of foreign-exchange transactions - Mirror Group settled each one a few days late, so that each transaction was effectively a short-term loan. To sustain his ballooning overdrafts, Maxwell offered the banks Mirror shares as security. But he became agitated as the share price fell, devaluing this \"currency\". Maxwell wanted to buy Mirror Group shares to try to support the price. But at the flotation, he had given an undertaking to Samuel Montagu that he would not do so. To avoid this, he arranged for purchases in the names of a series of related companies. The purchase of \u00a326m of Mirror shares was carried out by Eric Sheinberg, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, who comes in for severe criticism for failing to ask questions. The inspectors say: \"Mr Sheinberg must have come to appreciate in due course that Maxwell was in fact the purchaser.\" Over the course of 1990 and 1991, Maxwell spent \u00a3344m on buying shares in Mirror Group and his other quoted vehicle, Maxwell Communications Corporation. His borrowings became so acute that he pledged his entire 51% stake in the Mirror Group to banks as security for loans. In August 1991, the position became unsustainable. Maxwell's lenders were hav ing doubts. NatWest, for instance, felt he was becoming \"unpredictable\" and believed he had not dealt \"fully and frankly\" with the bank. First sign On August 12, Maxwell phoned Sheinberg and admitted he could not repay a $35m loan from Goldman Sachs that was due the next day. This was the first time he had reneged on a such a deal. Goldman was obliged by Stock Exchange rules to announce that it had a claim over 10% of Mirror Group and 4.8% of Maxwell Communications. This was the first public sign that Maxwell was in trouble. US bank Lehman Brothers demanded repayment of several large loans shortly afterwards. Maxwell obtained short-term help of \u00a350m from Bankers Trust, but he also began selling his treasured stakes in a series of promising Israeli companies. Spotting these transactions, Goldman concluded that Maxwell was in trouble, and lost hope of any repayment of its loans. It decided to sell the Mirror Group shares that Maxwell had offered as security - a move which would signal to other banks that it considered him a bad risk. On November 4, a senior Goldman executive telephoned Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, to inform him that these sales were imminent. Maxwell had been monitoring these events from his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine. In the early hours of November 5, he disappeared overboard. His death was announced that afternoon to Mirror Group's board, which asked the Stock Exchange to suspend dealing in the company's shares. Maxwell's sons, Kevin and Ian, were left in charge as the Maxwell empire unravelled with frightening speed. Within weeks, huge shortfalls in the Mirror Group's pension fund emerged, and the Serious Fraud Office began the task of unpicking Maxwell's tangled financial web.",

Several City institutions apologised for their roles in the Maxwell affair. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which owns Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accepted that its conduct \"fell short\", while Goldman Sachs issued a statement expressing \"deep regret\". The stockbroker Samuel Montagu, banks Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley and the law firm Clifford Chance were also criticised. Lord Donoughue, who served as a junior agriculture minister from 1997 to 1999, was accused of failing to ask questions while serving on the board of one of Maxwell's companies. The report attacked other non-executive directors including Sir Robert Clark, a former director of the Bank of England. Sir Robert refused to apologise for his conduct. He said the report was written \"with the benefit of hindsight\", adding that as a non-executive director of the Mirror Group, he could not \"ask the finance director every five minutes\" what was going on. The report called on the DTI to formally publish how it has responded to investigations such as this one. It said: \"Recommendations are sometimes implemented, sometimes rejected, sometimes considered for long periods and sometimes ignored.\" The DTI said it was taking legal advice before deciding if directors' disqualification proceedings were appropriate. \u0095 Read the report in full at MediaGuardian.co.uk",

About 80 birds have died and many more have been found covered in fuel and unable to move.

Skulls are piled neatly in great pyramids, the blood on the altar cloth is dark brown, and the walls and ceilings where blood spurted are blackened. Four Belgian priests left, saying they could not protect the people, the guardian says.</p> <p>Some Rwandan priests killed in the genocide, others were complicit in rounding up thousands of terrified Tutsis for killing.

Odette Nyiramilimo is the minister for local administration and social affairs, a mother, and as is common in Rwanda, has several orphans of the genocide absorbed into her family. \"So the Italians want to keep them because here they are poor - we are all poor, do they want to take all the children of Rwanda? Would my children prefer to live with Bill Clinton because he's rich? How can we say that living in a rich family is better? \"These children may be called Italians, but they will never feel Italian, there is discrimination and racism everywhere. What is their future sense of identity? You are looking at children with very complex and individual needs, the young ones of course speaking no Kinyarwanda.\" In April 1994, when the priests arrived at the border, the soldiers let them through on the promise that they would bring the children back after the war. It ended in three months, but today many of the children have been adopted, told they are Italian, and given new names. The story of the lost children of Gashora goes to the heart of the poisoned relationship between the Roman Catholic church and the murder of 800,000 people in three months of 1994 and its continued denial. The church at Nyamata, near Gashora, is a memorial to 20,000 people killed inside it or in the next door priests' compound. Skulls are piled neatly in great pyramids, the blood on the altar cloth is dark brown, and the walls and ceilings where blood spurted are blackened. Four Belgian priests left, saying they could not protect the people, the guardian says. Some Rwandan priests killed in the genocide, others were complicit in rounding up thousands of terrified Tutsis for killing. Today many of them are protected by their orders in France, Italy and Belgium from returning to face justice in what has become a very different society from the one they left.",

They are even using pneumatic drills,\" he said. The cloisters lie between the Retiro park and the Prado Museum, which wants the land for expansion. The government says it is simply taking the cloisters away, granite block by granite block, to restore them. But architects' plans show that only the arches will be conserved, and they will be hidden inside a red-brick, cube-shaped museum extension. Madrid is by no means an ancient city, and these cloisters, together with the San Jeronimo el Real monastery and church, are part of a building begun more than six centuries ago. Mr Zaragora is not the only person in the city looking on in amazement and with increasing anger as they disappear. An architect on the site admitted yesterday that within weeks there would be nothing left. A hole big enough to drive as truck through has already been knocked through the outer wall. The roof of the ground-floor gallery has been pulled down. Yesterday workers could be seen taking down the crests and shields that decorate the two stories of arches lining the inside of the cloisters. The demolition raises serious questions about the Spanish government's ability and political will to protect historic monuments. \"We have so few historic buildings in Madrid. If this one goes, then we are lost,\" said Paloma Gomez Embuena, president of the residents' association in this exclusive district, who has fought for seven years to save the building. The decision to wipe the cloisters from the landscape has come directly from the culture ministry. The building is being sacrificed so the Prado museum can expand. Its exhibition space will increased by half. In the architect Rafael Moneo's scheme the space occupied by the cloisters will be divided into a shop, restaurant, cloakroom, reading room, restoration centre and auditorium for visitors and academics. The arches will mostly become the reading room's walls, visible only to a privileged few. The rest of the building, including what are believed to be the buried remains of some 12th-century cloisters, will be bulldozed and thrown away. From the outside, visitors to Madrid will see only the Moneo cube. The architect is not to blame. The government commissioned him to build on the cloisters site after it declared void an international architectural contest for the Prado expansion which attracted more than 400 entries. Challenged in court, the government argued that the cloisters, partially partly destroyed by invading French troops 200 years ago and largely untended since then, are not a protected monument. The Royal Academy of History has protested. \"This is totally contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the laws protecting Spain's historical buildings,\" it said in a recent letter to the culture ministry. But the supreme court has ruled that removal of the cloisters and restoration of a part of them should be allowed. In recent days, however, the regional government of Madrid has finally admitted that the building and space around it are \"cultural heritage\" areas. Campaigners have also turned up previously unseen culture ministry orders that the building should not be touched. A new petition is before the supreme court, but it will take more than a week to be heard. By then there will be very little left.",

In West Bank towns, youths hurled rocks at soldiers who fired live rounds from jeeps and fortified outposts. Palestinian gunmen shot at a Jewish enclave in divided Hebron, and Israeli tanks shelled Arab neighbourhoods there. In Israel, meanwhile, tens of thousands of Israeli Arabs marched peacefully in the northern Galilee town of Sakhnin in an annual commemoration of protests at land expropriations in 1976 in which six Israeli Arabs were killed by police. Nearby, others mourned three town residents shot dead by Israeli police in anti-government protests last autumn. For the first time yesterday, Israeli Jews joined the march against Israel's confiscation of 5,000 acres of fields and olive groves near the town. Yesterday's clashes in the West Bank and Gaza capped a tumultuous week that began with the killing of a 10-month Jewish baby, by a Palestinian sniper, and was followed by suicide bombings, shootings and rocket attacks. In Sakhnin, the epicentre of the Land Day protests, a woman in a blue headscarf huddled over a new grave in the town cemetery, heaped with wreaths of flowers and placards. Imad Ghaniam, aged 25, a salesman, was among 13 Israeli Palestinians killed by police last autumn when the Arab towns of the Galilee went out into the streets to support the intifada in the West Bank and Gaza. \"He was one of God's angels walking on earth,\" said his mother, Rukiya Ghaniam. For Israel's 1m Arab citizens, this Land Day had particular resonance. Scarred by the killing of the 13 protesters, and deeply suspicious of Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, the community is caught between its own struggle for civil rights inside the Jewish state and its sympathies for the Palestinians. But they are growing increasingly assertive. When Abid al-Munaim Abu Saleh arrived here yesterday to visit the grave of his son, Walid, aged 21, who was also shot dead by police last October, he was treated as a minor hero.

      "body": "<p>The neurosurgeon stepped back from the control panel and, for a moment, all went still as we listened to the strange music filling the operating bloc. A river was rushing down a mountain, tumbling in a white frenzy over rocks, cascading into icy green pools. Or so it sounded. In fact we were sharing what must surely count as one of the most intimate of human experiences, more intimate than sex or childbirth: we were listening to Michael's mind, its electrical activity picked up by electrodes plunged deep into his brain. </p> <p>It sounded like a force of nature: tireless, ceaseless, burbling with energy. But the impression was misleading. For at least the past 16 years, Michael Holman's brain has not functioned as those of other people. That fact explained why we were gathered in a room in Grenoble's university hospital last month, unrecognisable and anonymous in our blue gowns and white masks, listening to his cerebral concerto. </p> <p>In his late 30s, Michael was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, an illness which causes the brain to gradually stop producing dopamine, the chemical that transmits the brain's motor instructions to nerves and muscles. For years, like the 120,000 other Parkinson's sufferers in Britain, he had been allowed to lead something approaching a normal life by taking levodopa, the miracle drug discovered in the 1960s which acts as a partial substitute for dopamine. </p> <p>Watching Michael take levodopa was like witnessing a Jekyll and Hyde metamorphosis. One moment he seemed 100 years old, shaking uncontrollably, shuffling as he walked, a fragile figure just asking to get mugged. Minutes later, as the drug kicked in, he straightened to become the man his friends remembered of old - dynamic, humorous, frighteningly incisive. With one bound, he was free. </p> <p>Parkinson's, which affects one in 100 people over 65, doesn't kill you. It doesn't - in most cases - even affect your mental faculties. It just destroys your life. The longer you take levodopa, the less effect it has. Side-effects - a squirming known as \"dyskinesia\", which produces convulsive leg kicks and head movements worthy of a BSE-stricken Friesian - become more pronounced. By last year, Michael's \"off\" moments, when he would be stuck in a chair, trembling uncontrollably, were heavily outnumbering his \"on\" moments. Dr Jekyll was making his excuses, and Mr Hyde was taking over. </p> <p>Early retirement from his job as Africa editor of the Financial Times loomed. Woken in the early hours by his own shuddering, Michael fantasised about a full night's sleep. I would cajole him into going out, only to regret such Panglossian optimism. It is not much fun watching your dining companion becoming rooted to their chair, incapable of lifting fork to mouth without flicking food at the wall. At the cinema, I could feel the split-second when his medication wore off: a gentle trembling would escalate to a full-throttle judder rippling down the row of seats. \"One of these days,\" I'd think, \"someone is going to accuse him of wanking and there will be a scene.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, Michael simply avoided such awkwardness by staying at home, embarrassed by the stares of strangers who assumed he was drunk. With even holding a book requiring effort, existence was shrinking to a living room and a television screen. </p> <p>Time was running out, yet none of the available alternatives seemed viable. A lot of excitement was being generated by research into foetal stem cells, injected into patients' brains in the hope that they would start producing dopamine. Earlier this month, crushing the hopes of millions of sufferers around the world, a Columbia University study showed that in 15% of those treated in this way, the outcome was worse than the disease, with the stem cells producing so much dopamine that patients went into uncontrollable, permanent spasms. </p> <p>Another path was surgery. As far back as the 50s, doctors discovered that destroying part of the brain's basal ganglia, or thalamus, known as \"lesioning\", relieved many of the symptoms of Parkinson's. But Michael's specialist had long counselled him against this. Once destroyed, the brain cells would be gone for ever, ruling out any possibility of future revival. </p> <p>Just as this unpalatable prospect was becoming to seem the only option, Michael began hearing about a groundbreaking surgical alternative. Getting details proved extremely difficult. But eventually we learned that neurosurgeon Alim Louis Benabid and neurologist Pierre Pollak, professors based in the French city of Grenoble, had perfected a technique in which two electrodes were inserted inside the subthalamic nucleus, an area deep inside the brain. A battery - installed in the chest like a pacemaker - then sent a low-voltage current into surrounding tissue. For reasons that remained tantalisingly unclear, such stimulation had a similar effect to dopamine. </p> <p>Crucially, the treatment didn't involve burning away precious brain cells. It was reversible, which meant Michael could benefit if stem-cell treatment proved effective in a few years' time. This wasn't a cure for Parkinson's, we were repeatedly warned. But if it could alleviate the main symptoms, it would already have worked a miracle. </p> <p>Why go to France? Neurosurgeons in Oxford, Bristol and Dundee were just beginning to carry out deep-brain stimulation. But Professor Benabid was undisputed master in his field, and British operations numbered in the dozens, while Grenoble had carried out over 150. If the waiting list loomed as a major issue - most French patients waited three years for the operation - funding did not. To our complete lack of surprise, Michael had been told by his specialist that the NHS would not pay for the operation, available for free under the French public health system. Whether carried out in Britain or France, the \u00a320,000 procedure would have to be privately funded - in this case by generous FT management. </p> <p>With Michael ensconced in a room in Grenoble's university hospital, boasting telephone, cable television and a view of the snow-topped Alps, it was swiftly clear we had fallen on our feet. There was none of the bureaucratic chaos or plain, old-fashioned filth experienced in a recent encounter with a London hospital. Wards were spotlessly clean, and staff consideration far greater than strictly necessary. When they said a procedure would be carried out on a particular day, it was - if not the day before. There was a special budget hostel for people visiting patients, a hospital hairdresser selling an impressive range of wigs for the newly operated, a hospital travel agency organising return trips; my God, even the food at the hospital cafe was decent. </p> <p>\"Be prepared. It's no cakewalk,\" warned a colleague who had watched a friend's father go through the procedure. She was right. But it was actually to prove far less gruelling than expected, an intense, uplifting experience which left me as rapturous and moved as a new father reeling punch-drunk from the delivery room. </p> <p>In the first of the three operations involved, Michael had his head shaved and five bolts, a little like the screws provided with Ikea shelving, drilled into his skull. The bolts meant he could be literally screwed into a rigid metal frame, ensuring his head was kept stationary during both the main operation itself and a preliminary scan to establish the exact location of Michael's brain structures. </p> <p>The second operation was the big one; the one teeth were gritted for and spines stiffened over. We had been warned to expect anything up to 20 hours. The previous week, a surgical team had emerged exhausted at three in the morning. Michael would have to be conscious throughout, guiding the surgeons to exactly the right spot with a running commentary on his sensations. The comforting oblivion of anaesthesia was not on offer, but Michael should not feel pain: the brain, paradoxically, does not have much sensation. </p> <p>With the surgeons' blessing, we had asked if a film director friend could video the procedure and I could take notes. It was a very journalistic way of dealing with personal crisis. But there was also a practical point to the request: a video logged with the Parkinson's Society would help to ensure that others did not repeat our tedious trawl for information. In any case, I wanted to be there as possible interpreter, should Michael find himself struggling to communicate with French staff. </p> <p> I stayed out of the operating bloc for the first few hours, warned that queasiness was most likely to strike at the start, when the surgeons used a high-pitched drill to pierce the skull. But I was called inside in time to hear the white noise of Michael's mind, picked up by five test electrodes delicately inserted through the hole in one side of his head. It is a sobering experience seeing someone you know splayed on a surgeon's table, blue-shrouded figures hovering, scalpels laid in neat rows. But there was not much blood: after all, not many tissues had been sliced into. Locked into his frame, with a physiotherapist massaging his limbs, Michael seemed cheerful and alert enough. </p> <p>Over the next few hours it became clear just why the operation took so long. Using what looked like the gadget for lowering a garage door, the neurophysicians sent currents to varying depths along each electrode, painstakingly monitoring Michael's reactions and the suppleness of his joints - floppy when sensitive cells were hit, stiff when the electrode was in the wrong place. \"I feel nauseous,\" he would say. Or: \"That was like a strong electric jolt.\" </p> <p>For minutes at a time, they would peer at his lips, watching for the slightest of tremors. The area of the brain controlling facial movement is just beyond the target area, so a trembling there was a helpful clue, indicating they had overshot. Once all electrodes had been tested, the team decided which was best positioned, then inserted a permanent one in its place. Working with the delicate precision of a sushi chef, the surgeon first patched the skull hole, then sealed it with dental cement. </p> <p>If the first insertion went swimmingly, the second seemed more alarming. With one side \"fixed\", Michael's second side became far more sensitive. The electrical jolts sent his body flipping around on the table like a fish on a marble slab, convulsions rippling down his face. \"He's not going be able to take much more of this,\" I thought as he wiggled and slithered. But as far as the surgeons were concerned, things were going just fine. </p> <p>Indeed, we finished in just 11 hours - an ultra speedy operation. As he realised that the end was near, Michael got a second wind. Euphoric, he chattered excitedly with the surgeon stitching him about French politics, and as they finally unbolted the metal frame, he was seemingly beside himself with relief, seizing the hands of those he was convinced had released him from a 16-year hell. \"The men and women who have imprisoned me have set me free,\" he said, and I found I had tears in my eyes. I had witnessed something very like a birth - the granting of a new life to a man who had nearly given up. </p> <p>That night, leaving a hyped-up Michael to rest, I celebrated at a local brasserie with the friend who had videoed the procedure and his French soundman, who impressed us both by coolly ordering tete de veau. Deposited in front of him with a flourish, the tranche of calf's brain was an exact replica of the X-rays of Michael's brain that we had spent the day gazing at with the medical profession's finest. \"Don't you think that's a bit inappropriate?\" we asked him, aghast. </p> <p>There was one last operation to go: the installing of a battery the size of a cigarette-lighter below Michael's collarbone, linked to the electrodes via wires snaking invisibly under his skin. Michael then spent a few weeks roaming the hospital in a wrinkled cream cap that made him look rather like an over-sized condom, as the doctors tinkered with medication and battery voltage, adjusted using a mouse held over Michael's chest. </p> <p>He's not quite there yet. Boasting scars that make it look as though a shark took his head in its mouth, then thought better of it, he still has a slight tremor and does a lot of sleeping. But the dyskinesia is gone, and the interminable periods where Michael shuddered and sweated, unresponsive to drugs, are a thing of the past. He has stopped taking dopamine entirely, and dropped two of his three other key drugs: a change that in itself will save the NHS over \u00a33,000 a year. The fact that a well-paid professional remains a taxpayer, rather than retiring early to claim disability benefit, also means the operation begins to pay its way. </p> <p>Michael goes back to Grenoble in three months for fine-tuning, by which time his chicklet's fuzz will have grown into real hair. But his voice has already become more forceful: he raps out questions at machine-gun speed, as though determined to make up for years of lost time. He radiates well-being and his joie de vivre has spilled over on to those who love him. \"In a way, I feel as though we've all been liberated,\" a Dutch friend in Kenya said over the phone the other day. </p> <p>Freedom looms, and with it huge questions. Given the chance to start again, where does a 56-year-old workaholic begin? Will Michael simply put in more hours at the office? Or will he discover Buddhism, go round the world with a backpack, learn to play the piano? Anything seems possible. For the moment, he is planning to retake a long-defunct driving test and talks of a driving holiday. Where would he like to go first? Why, France, of course. </p>",

At the cinema, I could feel the split-second when his medication wore off: a gentle trembling would escalate to a full-throttle judder rippling down the row of seats. \"One of these days,\" I'd think, \"someone is going to accuse him of wanking and there will be a scene.\" Increasingly, Michael simply avoided such awkwardness by staying at home, embarrassed by the stares of strangers who assumed he was drunk. With even holding a book requiring effort, existence was shrinking to a living room and a television screen. Time was running out, yet none of the available alternatives seemed viable. A lot of excitement was being generated by research into foetal stem cells, injected into patients' brains in the hope that they would start producing dopamine. Earlier this month, crushing the hopes of millions of sufferers around the world, a Columbia University study showed that in 15% of those treated in this way, the outcome was worse than the disease, with the stem cells producing so much dopamine that patients went into uncontrollable, permanent spasms. Another path was surgery. As far back as the 50s, doctors discovered that destroying part of the brain's basal ganglia, or thalamus, known as \"lesioning\", relieved many of the symptoms of Parkinson's. But Michael's specialist had long counselled him against this. Once destroyed, the brain cells would be gone for ever, ruling out any possibility of future revival. Just as this unpalatable prospect was becoming to seem the only option, Michael began hearing about a groundbreaking surgical alternative. Getting details proved extremely difficult. But eventually we learned that neurosurgeon Alim Louis Benabid and neurologist Pierre Pollak, professors based in the French city of Grenoble, had perfected a technique in which two electrodes were inserted inside the subthalamic nucleus, an area deep inside the brain. A battery - installed in the chest like a pacemaker - then sent a low-voltage current into surrounding tissue. For reasons that remained tantalisingly unclear, such stimulation had a similar effect to dopamine. Crucially, the treatment didn't involve burning away precious brain cells. It was reversible, which meant Michael could benefit if stem-cell treatment proved effective in a few years' time. This wasn't a cure for Parkinson's, we were repeatedly warned. But if it could alleviate the main symptoms, it would already have worked a miracle. Why go to France? Neurosurgeons in Oxford, Bristol and Dundee were just beginning to carry out deep-brain stimulation. But Professor Benabid was undisputed master in his field, and British operations numbered in the dozens, while Grenoble had carried out over 150. If the waiting list loomed as a major issue - most French patients waited three years for the operation - funding did not. To our complete lack of surprise, Michael had been told by his specialist that the NHS would not pay for the operation, available for free under the French public health system. Whether carried out in Britain or France, the \u00a320,000 procedure would have to be privately funded - in this case by generous FT management. With Michael ensconced in a room in Grenoble's university hospital, boasting telephone, cable television and a view of the snow-topped Alps, it was swiftly clear we had fallen on our feet. There was none of the bureaucratic chaos or plain, old-fashioned filth experienced in a recent encounter with a London hospital. Wards were spotlessly clean, and staff consideration far greater than strictly necessary. When they said a procedure would be carried out on a particular day, it was - if not the day before. There was a special budget hostel for people visiting patients, a hospital hairdresser selling an impressive range of wigs for the newly operated, a hospital travel agency organising return trips; my God, even the food at the hospital cafe was decent. \"Be prepared. It's no cakewalk,\" warned a colleague who had watched a friend's father go through the procedure. She was right. But it was actually to prove far less gruelling than expected, an intense, uplifting experience which left me as rapturous and moved as a new father reeling punch-drunk from the delivery room. In the first of the three operations involved, Michael had his head shaved and five bolts, a little like the screws provided with Ikea shelving, drilled into his skull. The bolts meant he could be literally screwed into a rigid metal frame, ensuring his head was kept stationary during both the main operation itself and a preliminary scan to establish the exact location of Michael's brain structures. The second operation was the big one; the one teeth were gritted for and spines stiffened over. We had been warned to expect anything up to 20 hours. The previous week, a surgical team had emerged exhausted at three in the morning. Michael would have to be conscious throughout, guiding the surgeons to exactly the right spot with a running commentary on his sensations. The comforting oblivion of anaesthesia was not on offer, but Michael should not feel pain: the brain, paradoxically, does not have much sensation. With the surgeons' blessing, we had asked if a film director friend could video the procedure and I could take notes. It was a very journalistic way of dealing with personal crisis. But there was also a practical point to the request: a video logged with the Parkinson's Society would help to ensure that others did not repeat our tedious trawl for information. In any case, I wanted to be there as possible interpreter, should Michael find himself struggling to communicate with French staff. I stayed out of the operating bloc for the first few hours, warned that queasiness was most likely to strike at the start, when the surgeons used a high-pitched drill to pierce the skull. But I was called inside in time to hear the white noise of Michael's mind, picked up by five test electrodes delicately inserted through the hole in one side of his head. It is a sobering experience seeing someone you know splayed on a surgeon's table, blue-shrouded figures hovering, scalpels laid in neat rows. But there was not much blood: after all, not many tissues had been sliced into. Locked into his frame, with a physiotherapist massaging his limbs, Michael seemed cheerful and alert enough. Over the next few hours it became clear just why the operation took so long. Using what looked like the gadget for lowering a garage door, the neurophysicians sent currents to varying depths along each electrode, painstakingly monitoring Michael's reactions and the suppleness of his joints - floppy when sensitive cells were hit, stiff when the electrode was in the wrong place. \"I feel nauseous,\" he would say. Or: \"That was like a strong electric jolt.\" For minutes at a time, they would peer at his lips, watching for the slightest of tremors. The area of the brain controlling facial movement is just beyond the target area, so a trembling there was a helpful clue, indicating they had overshot. Once all electrodes had been tested, the team decided which was best positioned, then inserted a permanent one in its place. Working with the delicate precision of a sushi chef, the surgeon first patched the skull hole, then sealed it with dental cement. If the first insertion went swimmingly, the second seemed more alarming. With one side \"fixed\", Michael's second side became far more sensitive. The electrical jolts sent his body flipping around on the table like a fish on a marble slab, convulsions rippling down his face. \"He's not going be able to take much more of this,\" I thought as he wiggled and slithered. But as far as the surgeons were concerned, things were going just fine. Indeed, we finished in just 11 hours - an ultra speedy operation. As he realised that the end was near, Michael got a second wind. Euphoric, he chattered excitedly with the surgeon stitching him about French politics, and as they finally unbolted the metal frame, he was seemingly beside himself with relief, seizing the hands of those he was convinced had released him from a 16-year hell. \"The men and women who have imprisoned me have set me free,\" he said, and I found I had tears in my eyes. I had witnessed something very like a birth - the granting of a new life to a man who had nearly given up. That night, leaving a hyped-up Michael to rest, I celebrated at a local brasserie with the friend who had videoed the procedure and his French soundman, who impressed us both by coolly ordering tete de veau. Deposited in front of him with a flourish, the tranche of calf's brain was an exact replica of the X-rays of Michael's brain that we had spent the day gazing at with the medical profession's finest. \"Don't you think that's a bit inappropriate?\" we asked him, aghast. There was one last operation to go: the installing of a battery the size of a cigarette-lighter below Michael's collarbone, linked to the electrodes via wires snaking invisibly under his skin. Michael then spent a few weeks roaming the hospital in a wrinkled cream cap that made him look rather like an over-sized condom, as the doctors tinkered with medication and battery voltage, adjusted using a mouse held over Michael's chest. He's not quite there yet. Boasting scars that make it look as though a shark took his head in its mouth, then thought better of it, he still has a slight tremor and does a lot of sleeping. But the dyskinesia is gone, and the interminable periods where Michael shuddered and sweated, unresponsive to drugs, are a thing of the past. He has stopped taking dopamine entirely, and dropped two of his three other key drugs: a change that in itself will save the NHS over \u00a33,000 a year. The fact that a well-paid professional remains a taxpayer, rather than retiring early to claim disability benefit, also means the operation begins to pay its way. Michael goes back to Grenoble in three months for fine-tuning, by which time his chicklet's fuzz will have grown into real hair. But his voice has already become more forceful: he raps out questions at machine-gun speed, as though determined to make up for years of lost time. He radiates well-being and his joie de vivre has spilled over on to those who love him. \"In a way, I feel as though we've all been liberated,\" a Dutch friend in Kenya said over the phone the other day. Freedom looms, and with it huge questions. Given the chance to start again, where does a 56-year-old workaholic begin? Will Michael simply put in more hours at the office? Or will he discover Buddhism, go round the world with a backpack, learn to play the piano? Anything seems possible. For the moment, he is planning to retake a long-defunct driving test and talks of a driving holiday. Where would he like to go first? Why, France, of course.",

      "body": "<p>In a huge rehearsal studio at the Royal Opera House, Alina Cojocaru is learning the choreography of her latest role, Giselle. Dominated by the vastness of the room, she seems more like an earnest student than one of the company's most hotly tipped ballerinas. One leg of her training pants is rolled to the knee showing a disregarded ladder snaking down the tights beneath. Her serious face is scrubbed as plain as an old-fashioned school girl. But as soon as she dances the choreography full out, her tiny body grows with the music. Her delicate arms lengthen, her legs soar and hover. It is the kind of transformation that makes thosewatching guess she could be fabulous on the night. </p> <p>The fact that Cojocaru is dancing this iconic role aged only 19 might in itself seem newsworthy, given that she last appeared in the ballet several months ago as an anonymous member of the corps de ballet. But for anyone who has followed her career since she joined the Royal Ballet in November 1999, this is just one more debut to add to a remarkable list. </p> <p>The first came 13 months ago when Cojocaru suddenly appeared in the lead role of Frederick Ashton's Symphonic Variations - taking over at five day's notice. No one knew who she was but by the interval everyone in the theatre was asking how to pronounce her name. Not only had she just demonstrated a rare instinct for the poetry and music of this elusive role, but the quality of her stage presence was uncannily reminiscent of the ballerina who had created it, Margot Fonteyn. </p> <p>Last December another injured dancer caused Cojocaru to be bumped up the cast lists - dancing Clara on the opening night of The Nutcracker in a performance that was also televised. Yet another injury in February resulted in her making a debut as Juliet, learning this huge role in only eight days. </p> <p>By then it was not only apparent that Cojocaru was a quick study but that technically there was little she could not do. All of this makes Cojocaru's story sound as if it has been scripted for a little girl's ballet book, as if she has been marked out by the ballet fairies for stardom. Off stage, she has the demeanour of a deserving Cinderella, so modest that when she walks down the corridor with me after rehearsal she ducks her head slightly as if apologising for taking up space. But as soon as she starts talking, it is obvious that ambition runs down her spine like solid steel. She is a dancer in control of her destiny. </p> <p>Cojocaru first took ballet classes in her native Romania, but when she was nine talent scouts offered her a place at the Kiev Ballet School. Even though this was a 27-hour train ride away, Cojocaru and her parents did not hesitate and she went to study there for the next seven years. </p> <p>At 17 she won an award at the Prix de Lausanne, which paid for six months' study at the Royal Ballet School in London. But the Ukrainians kept an eye on their prodigy and before Cojocaru's time in London was over asked her to dance with the Kiev Ballet. The Royal offered her a contract too. But while Britain was inviting her to join only at corps de ballet level, Ukraine was offering her principal status. For an ambitious teenager there was no contest. </p> <p>Cojocaru thus spent a year dancing a repertoire that most dancers only fantasise about - Aurora, Kitri, Cinderella - but being centre stage was not her only aim. She was hungry for a much wider range of ballets, and knowing the Royal Ballet's varied repertory she sent her CV asking for an audition. </p> <p>Monica Mason, the Royal's assistant director, says that \"when Alina was in the school, everyone obviously recognised she was a special talent, so of course we were delighted when she wanted to come back to us\". Cojocaru still had to enter at corps de ballet level but while she admits it was odd for her to be dancing in line for the first time - \"it is very difficult trying to be in the same style as everyone else, but still keeping your individuality\" - she maintains it was never a blow to her ego. \"You get a much bigger sense of the stage, of the whole ballet when you are in the corps than when you are a soloist.\" And it is clear that she never expected to be in the corps for long. While some dancers use their daily class as a gentle warm up, Cojocaru treated it as a performance. \"I danced class, I didn't just do it. I worked really hard so I supposed I would be noticed.\" And so she was, getting her first principal role within three months. </p> <p>Cojocaru was scared her rapid success might cause resentment in the corps, but even though ballet is predicated on a climate of open competition, dancers always respect hard work. As Mason says, \"when a talent is really special, everyone recognises it\". So when Cojocaru performed her first Juliet she says she \"never felt so much support\" in her life. \"The wings were crowded with people watching me and everyone wished me luck.\" She loses herself momentarily in the memory. \"It had always been my dream to dance this role. I loved everything in it. I don't have words to describe how I felt.\" </p> <p>The only flaw in that perfect night was the absence of her family, who had no time to arrange a visa. Cojocaru's physical delicacy makes her look too young to be cut off from her sister and parents. You want to put her in your pocket. Her English is fluent and she has good friends with whom she goes to the cinema and out for meals. But much of her free time is spent reading, listening to music and watching films. Everything feeds in to her work, especially studying the way actors work. \"I want to make my acting as natural as possible,\" she says. When she was preparing for Juliet she went through the whole ballet making up dialogue for each scene and acting it out in front of the mirror. </p> <p> Cojocaru would talk all day about ballet if you let her - about why she is trying to wean herself off hard pointe shoes, about why she prefers act one of Giselle to act two. But she is neither a bore nor a prig. She is funny, animated and happy about her work - it is her hobby as well her cause. She loves the fact that it allows her \"to be so many things on stage\" - not only the virginal maidens of classical ballet but most recently a sluttish babe in Ashley Page's This House Will Burn. (\"I was so happy to be in that ballet, to get the chance to show that there was another way for me.\") All she asks now is to remain in the Royal and learn many new roles. Later on she hopes to guest with other companies to meet new people and be around different companies even if they are very small\". </p> <p>Technically, it is easy to imagine Cojocaru maturing into a dancer who could pick and choose whatever role she wanted. Barring injury, burnout or personal wobbles she could well be phenomenal. What is harder to imagine is Cojocaru flaunting all the trappings that would come with international stardom. The fairy-tale successes of modern ballerinas are now coupled with photo shoots in Vogue, glossy advertising deals and spreads in Hello, none of which seem remotely part of her world. Cojocaru's modesty, stoicism and passion are unfashionable virtues, learned in the austerity of eastern Europe. It could be fascinating to see how they adapt to the fashion-led climate of western celebrity. </p> <p>\u0095 Alina Cojocaru makes her debut in Giselle at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), on April 14.</p>",

One leg of her training pants is rolled to the knee showing a disregarded ladder snaking down the tights beneath. Her serious face is scrubbed as plain as an old-fashioned school girl. But as soon as she dances the choreography full out, her tiny body grows with the music. Her delicate arms lengthen, her legs soar and hover. It is the kind of transformation that makes thosewatching guess she could be fabulous on the night. The fact that Cojocaru is dancing this iconic role aged only 19 might in itself seem newsworthy, given that she last appeared in the ballet several months ago as an anonymous member of the corps de ballet. But for anyone who has followed her career since she joined the Royal Ballet in November 1999, this is just one more debut to add to a remarkable list. The first came 13 months ago when Cojocaru suddenly appeared in the lead role of Frederick Ashton's Symphonic Variations - taking over at five day's notice. No one knew who she was but by the interval everyone in the theatre was asking how to pronounce her name. Not only had she just demonstrated a rare instinct for the poetry and music of this elusive role, but the quality of her stage presence was uncannily reminiscent of the ballerina who had created it, Margot Fonteyn. Last December another injured dancer caused Cojocaru to be bumped up the cast lists - dancing Clara on the opening night of The Nutcracker in a performance that was also televised. Yet another injury in February resulted in her making a debut as Juliet, learning this huge role in only eight days. By then it was not only apparent that Cojocaru was a quick study but that technically there was little she could not do. All of this makes Cojocaru's story sound as if it has been scripted for a little girl's ballet book, as if she has been marked out by the ballet fairies for stardom. Off stage, she has the demeanour of a deserving Cinderella, so modest that when she walks down the corridor with me after rehearsal she ducks her head slightly as if apologising for taking up space. But as soon as she starts talking, it is obvious that ambition runs down her spine like solid steel. She is a dancer in control of her destiny. Cojocaru first took ballet classes in her native Romania, but when she was nine talent scouts offered her a place at the Kiev Ballet School. Even though this was a 27-hour train ride away, Cojocaru and her parents did not hesitate and she went to study there for the next seven years. At 17 she won an award at the Prix de Lausanne, which paid for six months' study at the Royal Ballet School in London. But the Ukrainians kept an eye on their prodigy and before Cojocaru's time in London was over asked her to dance with the Kiev Ballet. The Royal offered her a contract too. But while Britain was inviting her to join only at corps de ballet level, Ukraine was offering her principal status. For an ambitious teenager there was no contest. Cojocaru thus spent a year dancing a repertoire that most dancers only fantasise about - Aurora, Kitri, Cinderella - but being centre stage was not her only aim. She was hungry for a much wider range of ballets, and knowing the Royal Ballet's varied repertory she sent her CV asking for an audition. Monica Mason, the Royal's assistant director, says that \"when Alina was in the school, everyone obviously recognised she was a special talent, so of course we were delighted when she wanted to come back to us\". Cojocaru still had to enter at corps de ballet level but while she admits it was odd for her to be dancing in line for the first time - \"it is very difficult trying to be in the same style as everyone else, but still keeping your individuality\" - she maintains it was never a blow to her ego. \"You get a much bigger sense of the stage, of the whole ballet when you are in the corps than when you are a soloist.\" And it is clear that she never expected to be in the corps for long. While some dancers use their daily class as a gentle warm up, Cojocaru treated it as a performance. \"I danced class, I didn't just do it. I worked really hard so I supposed I would be noticed.\" And so she was, getting her first principal role within three months. Cojocaru was scared her rapid success might cause resentment in the corps, but even though ballet is predicated on a climate of open competition, dancers always respect hard work. As Mason says, \"when a talent is really special, everyone recognises it\". So when Cojocaru performed her first Juliet she says she \"never felt so much support\" in her life. \"The wings were crowded with people watching me and everyone wished me luck.\" She loses herself momentarily in the memory. \"It had always been my dream to dance this role. I loved everything in it. I don't have words to describe how I felt.\" The only flaw in that perfect night was the absence of her family, who had no time to arrange a visa. Cojocaru's physical delicacy makes her look too young to be cut off from her sister and parents. You want to put her in your pocket. Her English is fluent and she has good friends with whom she goes to the cinema and out for meals. But much of her free time is spent reading, listening to music and watching films. Everything feeds in to her work, especially studying the way actors work. \"I want to make my acting as natural as possible,\" she says. When she was preparing for Juliet she went through the whole ballet making up dialogue for each scene and acting it out in front of the mirror. Cojocaru would talk all day about ballet if you let her - about why she is trying to wean herself off hard pointe shoes, about why she prefers act one of Giselle to act two. But she is neither a bore nor a prig. She is funny, animated and happy about her work - it is her hobby as well her cause. She loves the fact that it allows her \"to be so many things on stage\" - not only the virginal maidens of classical ballet but most recently a sluttish babe in Ashley Page's This House Will Burn. (\"I was so happy to be in that ballet, to get the chance to show that there was another way for me.\") All she asks now is to remain in the Royal and learn many new roles. Later on she hopes to guest with other companies to meet new people and be around different companies even if they are very small\". Technically, it is easy to imagine Cojocaru maturing into a dancer who could pick and choose whatever role she wanted. Barring injury, burnout or personal wobbles she could well be phenomenal. What is harder to imagine is Cojocaru flaunting all the trappings that would come with international stardom. The fairy-tale successes of modern ballerinas are now coupled with photo shoots in Vogue, glossy advertising deals and spreads in Hello, none of which seem remotely part of her world. Cojocaru's modesty, stoicism and passion are unfashionable virtues, learned in the austerity of eastern Europe. It could be fascinating to see how they adapt to the fashion-led climate of western celebrity. \u0095 Alina Cojocaru makes her debut in Giselle at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), on April 14.",

      "body": "<p>The popular and interesting tropical look that has returned to our gardens, giving a place for certain flamboyant plants which might previously have failed a taste test, is the result of an ingenious mix and match. It does not resemble a real tropical garden very closely. Rather, it gives an impression of lush colourfulness and rampant growth, using whatever plant material suits the fantasy of the designer. </p> <p>When an actual habitation is established in your actual tropics, the first plants to surround the house will be economic staples such as coconut, banana, bamboo and papaya. None of these will perform for us in their tropical varieties, although papaya grows so fast from seed it would be worth trying in the conservatory. Real bananas are always grown from offsets. </p> <p>The first ornamental plants to grace an actual tropical garden are the same the whole world round (tropical gardens can pall after a while): bougainvillea, hibiscus and some sort of impatiens will be sure evidence of human habitation. Orchids hanging under the eaves, or tied on to tree trunks, will show that the garden has passed stage one. But often this is as far as things will go. Barrio gardens are seldom very elaborate, just as cottage gardens, in the days of cottagers, were much less fancy than legend suggests. </p> <p>Two flowers of use in the temperate garden, both of which can be grown from seed, are widespread in the tropics. The first is Lantana camara , a small shrub with bright flower heads in a mixture of red, orange and yellow. A kind of verbena, it has become a roadside weed in the tropics. Thompson and Morgan offers , Lantana Camara Mixed Hybrids (no 86) while Chiltern Seeds has a dwarf version. The second is No 87, the familiar Thunbergia alata , Black-eyed Susan, available from both catalogues, a small climber sold here for hanging baskets. The best easily available photographic reference book for tropical flowers is the two-volume Conservatory and Indoor Plants by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix (Pan), a work somewhat mislabelled since it is full of photographs of plants in their natural habitats.

      "bodyText": "The popular and interesting tropical look that has returned to our gardens, giving a place for certain flamboyant plants which might previously have failed a taste test, is the result of an ingenious mix and match. It does not resemble a real tropical garden very closely. Rather, it gives an impression of lush colourfulness and rampant growth, using whatever plant material suits the fantasy of the designer. When an actual habitation is established in your actual tropics, the first plants to surround the house will be economic staples such as coconut, banana, bamboo and papaya. None of these will perform for us in their tropical varieties, although papaya grows so fast from seed it would be worth trying in the conservatory. Real bananas are always grown from offsets. The first ornamental plants to grace an actual tropical garden are the same the whole world round (tropical gardens can pall after a while): bougainvillea, hibiscus and some sort of impatiens will be sure evidence of human habitation. Orchids hanging under the eaves, or tied on to tree trunks, will show that the garden has passed stage one. But often this is as far as things will go. Barrio gardens are seldom very elaborate, just as cottage gardens, in the days of cottagers, were much less fancy than legend suggests. Two flowers of use in the temperate garden, both of which can be grown from seed, are widespread in the tropics. The first is Lantana camara , a small shrub with bright flower heads in a mixture of red, orange and yellow. A kind of verbena, it has become a roadside weed in the tropics. Thompson and Morgan offers , Lantana Camara Mixed Hybrids (no 86) while Chiltern Seeds has a dwarf version. The second is No 87, the familiar Thunbergia alata , Black-eyed Susan, available from both catalogues, a small climber sold here for hanging baskets. The best easily available photographic reference book for tropical flowers is the two-volume Conservatory and Indoor Plants by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix (Pan), a work somewhat mislabelled since it is full of photographs of plants in their natural habitats. Two pages of Thunbergias here are enough to provoke the appetite for a flower, climbing or trailing, which turns out, surprisingly, to be an acanthus relative.

A classic \"thief-taker\", the accolade most prized by officers, his exploits led the Daily Express to hail him in 1972 as the \"Nation's Number One Gangbuster\". He was also in charge of the anti-terrorist squad in 1973 when 10 people were arrested hours after leaving four huge car bombs in the capital, becoming famous for his \"close England\" edict which caught the culprits before they fled the country. He was peripherally involved in the investigations into the Guildford pub bombings, and the blowing up of an army coach on the M62 in 1972, which led to the jailing of Judith Ward.

It is social housing, for rent at just \u00a375.58 per week - no more than the Woolstons paid for their council house on a hectic nearby estate.</p> <p>Social housing has finally started to challenge the traditional stereotypes. Local authorities, in partnership with housing associations, have taken the best lessons learnt by architects and realised them as an investment. Forget the grim tower blocks and bland, shoddy, low-rises of the past. This new social housing is typified by contemporary design, energy-efficiency and \"flexible living\" (the buzzwords of modern architecture) within a high-quality environment.</p> <p>The change has been social, as well as architectural. Social housing is no longer segregated off on estates; it is \"pepper-potted\" in among private homes. Adjustment has to come from both sides.</p> <p>At the Greenwich Millennium Village, social housing will eventually make up 20% of the properties. The Woolstons' house, rented through Moat Housing Association, is one of the first to be built. It is one of eight, two- and three-bed homes with identical designs to some of the nearby private homes on the market. The Woolstons' timber-framed house, designed by London architects Proctor Matthews, is clad in a colourful combination of modular aluminium, cedar and blue render panels, and topped with an aluminium roof.</p> <p>Ceilings are 20cm higher than average to give a more spacious interior - also helped by the generous glazed windows that blur the boundary with the outside. Everything is built around an open-plan design, to accommodate changing tenants' needs throughout their lives. There are wide corridors and doorways to allow wheelchairs, and a rubber-floored toilet downstairs, plumbed to take a shower if the ground floor needs to be converted to include a bedroom.</p> <p>For the Woolstons, who are coming up to retirement age, the new two-bedroom house is a blessing after their three-storey council house where the kitchen was on a different floor to the dining room.</p> <p>\"We just wanted a smaller place. We're not getting any younger and I don't want all those stairs,\" says Janice, tired of putting her dinner on a tray to carry up to the lounge and delighted with the spacious layout of her new home.</p> <p>\"It's the best house we've had,\" adds Ronald. \"It's a step up from what councils normally build - a bit more thought has gone into it.\"</p> <p>Despite living on a construction site while the rest of the village is built, the couple are glad of the peace and quiet after the rowdy estate they lived on before. \"It's so lovely and warm, even when it's cold outside. We've only used two radiators since we've been here,\" says Janice. The heating bills are only \u00a370 a quarter, thanks to good insulation, energy-efficient appliances and low-cost electricity from a combined heat and power plant.</p> <p>This kind of energy-efficient design has infiltrated social housing across the country. At the recently completed Millennium Homes development, in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, green issues were at the heart of a design for 15 new houses built for Tewkesbury Borough Council and Gloucestershire Housing Association. Architects Cater Day won awards for a design featuring a \"sunspace\" on each house that resembles a giant conservatory. This acts as a passive solar collector, supplemented by solar panels in the steel roof that help to heat the water. Heat is retained in the highly-insulated timber-framed structure. These measures, along with water-saving bathroom equipment and energy-saving lighting, have already yielded dividends for the tenants.</p> <p>Resident Sharon Deniss is delighted with her new home, especially her bills, which like the Woolstons' are much lower than she'd been used to. \"The houses are absolutely super - there's plenty of space in them. I've had my first gas bill and it's certainly a lot cheaper.\"</p> <p>With two daughters, she appreciates the flexibility of the spacious 6.4m by 4.2m living room, and plans to put in glass partitions to create play and quiet areas. The house abuts the pavement, and she feels happier with her 3.3m sun porch now that she has put up some blinds for greater privacy.</p> <p>An interplay between indoor and outdoor space was also a feature of the stunning social housing within Glasgow's Homes For The Future development, at Glasgow Green: a medley of apartments and houses designed by different architects as part of the city's 1999 Year Of Architecture &amp; Design festival.</p> <p>Designed by the acclaimed firm Ian Ritchie Architects, for the New Housing Association, the block of 12 two-bed flats is every inch the contemporary urban development, with glass and copper facade, and great views over Glasgow Green from a generous outdoor terrace running around each flat.</p> <p>\"Everyone thought I'd landed loads of money when I got the flat because no one could believe that housing of that standard is rented,\" says Lucy Kennedy, a co-tenant of one of the top-floor flats, who moved in a few months ago. \"People think that if it's social housing, it won't be that good. I really like it - its location and the view of the city, and how it's really modern.\"</p> <p>Again, Kennedy enjoys a large, flexible living space which runs the length of the flat, intended by the architects to be customised according to different tenants' needs. \"Every person has their flat a different way. We have the eating area in the middle, the living room at one end and a quiet area at the other,\" says Kennedy. While the Glasgow development is on a relatively small scale, high-quality contemporary architecture is also finding its way into mass social housing. Regeneration of the once-notorious Stonebridge estate, in Brent, north London, by the Stonebridge Housing Action Trust, seeks to restore a human scale and sense of place to the properties under the auspices of master planners and lead architects, Shepheard Epstein Hunter.</p> <p>When consulted, tenants rejected another dense, high-rise design and voted for less open space but more houses, and so the grim towers are gradually being replaced by 1,400 low-rise houses and apartments in a variety of styles by different architects, intended to break down the previously monotonous character of the estate.</p> <p>Alain Head, director of Shepheard Epstein Hunter, says that while the regeneration is in some ways playing safe by going back to traditional street patterns of terraced housing and small apartment blocks, at least it is a formula that works. \"There's nothing pretentious,\" he says. \"We're not trying to be experimental. You make a mistake here and you do it 1,400 times. The thing that really is innovative is that while many developments are very monotone - with the same brick - here suddenly you turn a corner and there's something different.\"</p> <p>David Richards, a long-time resident of Stonebridge, was one of the first to move into one of the new houses with his daughter and granddaughter. It is a low-built, three-bedroom house. \"I used to live in Haskell House, one of the worst of the tower blocks, so it's a big difference,\" he says, appreciating having his own front door and garden after nine years of high-rise living. \"It's not what we expected. The house almost feels like you're not on Stonebridge. It's very quiet, very peaceful. Before, there were disturbances, but we're completely out of that now.\"</p> <p>It's not surprising that he and tenants of other innovative housing projects are feeling the change to their lives so soon after moving in. Perhaps the whole ethos of social housing, which was once to provide pleasant, thriving communities for people who had been marginalised by the high-earning, house-buying populace, is finally coming to fruition. Perhaps the 21st century will make up for some of the post-war mistakes we made on our council estates.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In this month's Talk, a reader by the unlikely name of Frank D Troutman (mind you, with such splendidly Runyonesque types as Michael Q Bullerdick, Steven Henry Madoff and Mike Fish on their staff, they're kind of asking for it) gets very excited by a recent profile of the young film actor Matt Damon which ran under the strapline MATT DAMON NEEDS A BED. In it, Mr Damon says, rather unconvincingly\u00e2 \"I literally have nowhere to sleep.\" In response, Mr Troutman rages, \"That someone of Damon's financial status would make such a statement is unacceptable. Poverty and homelessness are significant problems in this country and not to be taken lightly. All anyone has to do,\" he trails off rather disappointingly, \"is pick up a newspaper to see the number of people in this country who truly have nowhere to sleep...\" But building up to a fine finish, he thunders, \"It was thoughtless, untrue and inconsiderate towards those less fortunate.\"</p> <p>But oh, so cool! I, for one, fear for the viability of Mr Troutman's writing hand this month, for everywhere one looks in the exceedingly small world of glossy newsprint there seem to be glowing young actors boasting about their homelessness. A piece in Premiere starts \"Paul Walker is homeless\", and goes on to tell us that the 27-year-old star of Pleasantville and Varsity Blues likes it fine that way: \"I'd feel restricted.\" Elsewhere, Johnny Depp, who earns a fortune per picture, talks yearningly of a life on the open road with one bag and a guitar as the highest state of grace available to modern man.</p> <p>As if to rub in how very tiny-minded and uncool having a home is, the Daily Mail (whose manifesto might best be summed up as the overwhelming fear that someone, somewhere, is having fun) is full of its current Ideal Home Show.

      "bodyText": "In this month's Talk, a reader by the unlikely name of Frank D Troutman (mind you, with such splendidly Runyonesque types as Michael Q Bullerdick, Steven Henry Madoff and Mike Fish on their staff, they're kind of asking for it) gets very excited by a recent profile of the young film actor Matt Damon which ran under the strapline MATT DAMON NEEDS A BED. In it, Mr Damon says, rather unconvincingly\u00e2 \"I literally have nowhere to sleep.\" In response, Mr Troutman rages, \"That someone of Damon's financial status would make such a statement is unacceptable. Poverty and homelessness are significant problems in this country and not to be taken lightly. All anyone has to do,\" he trails off rather disappointingly, \"is pick up a newspaper to see the number of people in this country who truly have nowhere to sleep...\" But building up to a fine finish, he thunders, \"It was thoughtless, untrue and inconsiderate towards those less fortunate.\" But oh, so cool! I, for one, fear for the viability of Mr Troutman's writing hand this month, for everywhere one looks in the exceedingly small world of glossy newsprint there seem to be glowing young actors boasting about their homelessness. A piece in Premiere starts \"Paul Walker is homeless\", and goes on to tell us that the 27-year-old star of Pleasantville and Varsity Blues likes it fine that way: \"I'd feel restricted.\" Elsewhere, Johnny Depp, who earns a fortune per picture, talks yearningly of a life on the open road with one bag and a guitar as the highest state of grace available to modern man. As if to rub in how very tiny-minded and uncool having a home is, the Daily Mail (whose manifesto might best be summed up as the overwhelming fear that someone, somewhere, is having fun) is full of its current Ideal Home Show.

      "body": "<p>It is essential to have spiky plants in any British garden, where most of the vegetation is soft-looking. They give an immediate lift (much like the first glass of champagne on a Sunday morning). The eye homes in on them, and only then seeks out the supporting cast. When I begin to think about them individually, they all seem to have one fault or another, but then that\u00d5s no worse than with people. <br></p> <p>One of the trickiest is hardiness. But this is a good time of the year to be writing about less hardy plants. We can worry about how to carry them over once we have enjoyed them through the summer. Grasses obviously qualify as spiky plants, but many of them have too narrow a leaf to look truly noble. Exceptionally, Setaria palmifolia has quite a broad leaf with handsome parallel ridges along its entire length. By the end of the season it will have made a large clump and you\u00d5ll be tremendously proud of it, but it is tender and must be potted up and overwintered under frost-free glass \u00d1 well worth the trouble, I assure you. It will grow about 0.5m tall, but more than double that height if it decides to flower in the autumn. <br></p> <p>Of course, there are many other grasses. Stipa gigantea is one of the best, flowering at 2.5m in June and remaining presentable for at least three months if not exposed to fierce winds. But here, it is the flowering stalks rather than the spiky leaves that holds our attention. The leaves themselves are pretty mundane. I am a great protagonist of blue lyme grass, Leymus arenarius (0.7m), which is tough as they come and very blue on its young foliage in early summer; either harmonise it with blue flowers (siting it at the border\u00d5s front) or contrast it with red. I find that one clump is generally enough and it is the devil of a spreader, like a nightmare version of couch. Every spring, you need to dig it out and trace all runners that have strayed a metre or more; then replant the core material, cutting it back so that all its foliage is young and fresh. Fergus does this willingly, but not everyone would. <br></p> <p>The desert-loving agaves from North America have a wonderful presence, the best known being Agave americana, which is glaucous, and, even more popular, \u00d4Variegata\u00d5, which has a broad yellow stripe either side of its long, fleshy leaves. These leaves, arranged in a loose rosette, take on seductive curves, and they are intriguingly marked with the shadow, so to speak, of the neighbouring leaf, left on it when the two were tightly furled together. These agaves are hardy only on our coastal resorts, but it is well worth growing a few of them in pots and plunging these in key positions for the summer, as Beth Chatto does in her gravel garden, where the flattened domes of Sedum \u00d4Autumn Joy\u00d5 make a telling background. <br></p> <p>Another way to use an agave is in a cluster of pots arranged for summer display on your patio or outside your entrance porch. Other plants around it can then be as soft as you like but the agave will hold everything together. Yuccas, also from North America, are as spiky as they come. Boldest, stiffest and as hardy as any is Yucca gloriosa. This makes a large globe of rather dangerously spiky leaves, and when a rosette is large enough it will flower dramatically, at 2m, with a huge candelabrum of waxy, cream-coloured bells. They may be borne any time from July to October. This yucca is so domineering that some people resent its overbearing presence, but it certainly makes its mark. It needs looking after; feed it well if you want flowers, and do not allow too many competing foliar crowns. It is also important, for the sake of smartness, to pull off old, dead foliage. The variegated form is a lot less solemn; also less vast. <br></p> <p>Furcraea longaeva bears a strong resemblance to a yucca, but has a notably blue bloom on its leaves which are neither stiff nor sharply pointed. But it is not hardy and must be transferred in and out of doors as and when the weather demands. Given milder winters, many phormiums have proved hardy. This is the New Zealand flax. Phormium tenax and its many named cultivars will make huge clumps, 2m or more high, which are, I have to say, rather awkward to manage. A clump can outgrow its allotted space and need reducing, but this is easier said than done. Even if you don\u00d5t kill yourself lifting a colony and dividing it, the phormium itself will take a dim view of the proceedings and sulk for a long while afterwards. Still, you can\u00d5t be ruled by your plants forever. <br></p> <p>P. cookianum is hardier and has flexible, not stiff, foliage. I am fond of P. c. \u00d4Tricolor\u00d5, which has green, purple and cream striping. It also flowers regularly, which is quite an event, although unconventional. On a low scale, Sisyrinchium striatum (0.5m), with spiky, iris-like leaves, makes a pretty plant in youth and has pale yellow flowers in early summer, but plants age badly, their leaves turning black. The variegated \u00d4Aunt May\u00d5 is a charmer in youth, but must be frequently renewed. <br></p> <p>Irises themselves, especially the bearded kinds, are notably spiky, but generally become an eyesore once they have flowered. They do in my garden, anyway, whatever your claims (which I don\u00d5t have to believe). If you repeatedly replant Iris pallida \u00d4Argentea Variegata\u00d5 (white variegated) and \u00d4Variegata\u00d5 (yellow-variegated) in spring, forgetting about their flowers, they will remain smart foliage plants right through summer and autumn</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>He juts; he pouts; he poses. The flimsiest of loincloths struggles to stay around the top of his thighs. We never glimpse him more or less than teasingly stripped. Boyish, yet muscular. Pale-skinned; slender, soft and taut. And by further schematic consent, his attitude is one of mild gyration at the midriff - just enough to make his hips incline. So he invites as he recoils. He flaunts an allure of delicious vulnerability. <br></p> <p>And, indeed, he is wounded. Quite severely, we should say. Pierced by arrows - through his lungs, his legs, his torso, his brow, and more. Sometimes the arrows are so densely clustered into his flesh he can look like a porcupine. Yet he does not split the skies with anything so unseemly as an agonised howl. He may concede a gasp or a wince. More often, though, he just purses his lips - as if for a kiss. <br></p> <p>This is the typical image of St Sebastian and it is no revelation to hail it as a gay icon. How could it not be? But the image goes far beyond that. It brings us to the bewildering place where beauty and wretchedness, delight and disgust, ecstasy and torment, all conspire to lose their normal polar opposition. <br></p> <p>A painting of St Sebastian is put on display as a work of art, an object of admiration, connoisseurship. Gallery labels tell of an artist; they may supply a provenance, too. Because this is the image of a saint, its original position to viewers was invariably in some sacred setting, with prayer or reverence the appropriate attitude of respect. But to be aware of that fact only doubles our sense of bewilderment. <br></p> <p>Pious as it once was, every picture of St Sebastian remains a full-tilt assault upon aesthetic complacency. The sort of language routinely applied to the S&amp;M photography of Robert Mapplethorpe or the art-stunts of 'Brit Art' belongs no less to the hallowed iconography of this Christian martyr. It is sensational, deplorable, macabre, and morally confused. And yet it is exquisite, too.<br></p> <p>It is a paradox that beauty can cohabit with, or arise from, grievous bodily harm, but it is not a novel problem. In the 18th century, men of letters earnestly debated whether it was right to take aesthetic delight in a classical statue showing a man and his two sons beset by giant serpents. In our own time, it is almost an annual Hollywood routine that someone in or out of the film industry will flagellate the moguls for their excess of entertaining violence. A few centuries ago, the prospect of a public execution would have emptied any London theatre. Cameramen have to work harder to conjure the same thrill of horror now; but it is all the more memorable when they do. Are we sick, to take pleasure from pain? What is the good of ghastly art? Let us see if he has the answers - this pouting, punctured Saint Sebastian. <br> Was there ever such a person as the 'historical' Sebastian? Presumably; but - in common with the many sanctified heroes and heroines of early Christian witness - not definitively. The tale of Sebastian's testimony - the passionate insubordination of one of the emperor's close bodyguards - is chronologically located in the reign of the Roman tetrarch Diocletian, who in AD303 conducted the last campaign of Christian persecutions by imperial Rome. Sebastian, a Christian member of the elite cohort known as the Praetorian Guard, serves with honour in a promising military career, yet ultimately is forced to put his loyalty to Christ before obedience to his superiors (the joint emperors Diocletian and Maximian). His punishment is be used as target practice by his fellow guardsmen; yet Sebastian survives, and is nursed back to health by a co-believer called Irene, only to reaffirm his faith with extra vigour.<br></p> <p>Diocletian then has him flogged, or pulverised, to death within imperial precincts, and his body flung into the great sewer of Rome, the Cloaca Maxima. Somehow the corpse is recovered. Final defilement only proves another step toward the accolade of sainthood. No classical author records the episode, but this narrative is to be found in The Golden Legend (Legenda aurea) of one Jacobus da Voragine (1230-98) whose omnibus collection of saintly lives was one of the world's first best-sellers, rolling off prototype presses throughout Europe (personally translated by pioneer printer William Caxton, The Golden Legend went through nine editions in English alone between 1483 and 1527). <br></p> <p>It is true that when The Golden Legend became exposed to the learned scrutiny of Italian humanists in the late 15th century, it was held up to ridicule as a farrago of improbable evangelising antics. Still, it was the principal literary source for European painters commissioned to produce an image of St Sebastian - even if, in graphic terms, the description verged on the grotesque. It is The Golden Legend that says Sebastian \"was needled like a hedgehog with the strikes of the arrows\". That particular aspect was mostly eschewed by the artists, perhaps because it risked making a laughably odd metamorphosis of the saint who was the staunch \u00dc\"Soldier of Christ\". At the same time, The Golden Legend account of Sebastian's ordeal helps to explain the aspect of noble passivity conventionally bestowed upon the saint in art. For Jacobus allows no purple swell of empathy for the pangs of pierced Sebastian. His Sebastian does not writhe or struggle, nor scream, as the arrows puncture his flesh. Jacobus locates the firing-squad in Rome's Campus Martius, \"the Field of Mars\u00ee. <br></p> <p>Perhaps because the image is so superficially \"familiar\" to us, it is a story rarely relayed in any detail. One of those rare retellings comes in the autobiographical novel of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, Confessions Of A Mask (1949). Centuries after Jacobus, it is Mishima who most clearly voices the homoerotic response to Sebastian's distress. As a youth, he recalls, he came across a reproduction of an image of St Sebastian attributed to Guido Reni. Instinctually, the sight of the image called forth the boy's first ardent, rapid and productive act of masturbation. And it was not the last of the fascination. Later - prefiguring the suicidal act of public hara-kiri which he committed in 1970 - Mishima would imitate Sebastian's posture and punishment: such was the extent of his empathetic adoration of the saint. Mishima was a body-builder, imbued with the logic of \"no pain, no gain\"; he may also have been conditioned by a Samurai tradition of warrior-heroics with its own decorum of pain and beautified cruelty. But he was not entirely eccentric in his eroticised viewing of St Sebastian. In Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's thinly fictional fantasy Venus In Furs (1870), St Sebastian is named - along with several other spectacular Christian martyrs - as an incitement to the sexual pleasure now categorised as \"masochism\". More discreetly, in 1877, the British aesthete and historian John Addington Symonds published a fervent judgment upon one Italian Renaissance image of St Sebastian: to the effect that \"suffering, refined and spiritual, without contortion or spasm, could not be presented with more pathos in a form of more surpassing loveliness\". Symonds, who sublimated his own homosexuality as \"a problem of Greek ethics\", applied his superlatives to a tellingly-chosen picture. It was St Sebastian as rendered by a Sienese-based painter who enjoyed the sobriquet of Il Sodoma, \"the Sodomite\" - \"a spirited and licentious man\", we are told, \"who always had about him boys and beardless lads, whom he loved more than was decent\". <br></p> <p>That censorious information comes from Giorgio Vasari, biographer to so many of the virtuosi of the Italian Renaissance. If we rove further in his Lives Of The Artists, we find an anecdote about the Florentine painter Fra Bartolommeo who, according to Vasari, once created an image of St Sebastian in order to prove that he, a regular Dominican friar, could master the nude figure as well as any artist. The result had to be removed from the church where it was first exposed. Female viewers were coming to the confessional, as Vasari puts it, \"having sinned [peccato] at the very sight of the allure and suggestive realism given to the figure by Fra Bartolommeo\". <br></p> <p>Vasari leaves us in little doubt that one reason for Sebastian's favour within the artistic repertoire lay precisely in the opportunities offered by the saint for representing \"a nice nude body\" (un bel corpo ignudo) - give or take the flimsy loincloth, or a pair of diaphanous briefs. The earliest representations of the saint had eschewed the shooting drama altogether: in sixth- or seventh-century mosaics at Rome (in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli) and Ravenna (in the Basilica of St Apollinare Nuovo), St Sebastian appears robed and bearded and simply carrying the crown of martyrdom. Later on, few artists would ever show the ultimate fate of the saint - his beating and deposition in a sewer. <br></p> <p>The depiction of the covert removal of arrows by Sebastian's Christian nurse Irene eventually gains some popularity in the 17th century (a subject well-suited for such \"baroque\" candle-lighting specialists as Georges de la Tour). But it is fair to say that St Sebastian's formulaic popularity among Italian Renaissance painters (and some sculptors) is almost exclusively located in the target-practice episode. And they made the most of their respectably pious cover. <br></p> <p>So, for Cima da Conegliano (an altarpiece in the National Gallery), St Sebastian was a barely pubescent boy. To Piero della Francesca, as a figure in his Misericordia Polyptych at Sansepolcro in Umbria, Sebastian was a distinctly stumpy youth, utterly oblivious to the thick darts lodged around his body. Giovanni Bellini, for an attributed altarpiece in the church of saints Giovanni e Paolo (Venice), flagrantly used Sebastian's heroic near-nudity for the purpose of making contrast with the robed clerical sanctity of his central subject, the preacher St Vincent Ferrer. Antonio Pollaiuolo's version of 1475 earned praise from Vasari, not only for the figure of St Sebastian but also for the circle of archers - each one of them imaginable as some strutting Florentine blade. Pollaiuolo set his scene quite distinctively - out of town, with the Arno valley unwinding beyond. By contrast, Antonello da Messina (in his version now at Dresden, painted c1474-5, and latterly much admired by Samuel Beckett) chose a location in a piazza, allowing for more nuances of urbane heartlessness: dames chatting from their balconies; a soldier sprawled on the pavement; carpets hanging out to air. <br></p> <p>Whatever the setting, one thing is clear: these artists used a model for their images of the tough and tender guardsman. The almost bas-relief subcutaneous forms of Botticelli's Sebastian are surmised to be the effect of the artist working from a figure posing in candlelight. Vasari tells how one North Italian painter, called Bonsignori, was happily painting a picture of St Sebastian in his studio, using a bound-up porter as a model, when the ducal patron of the piece came in and commented how unconvincing the picture appeared. Did this Sebastian look like a man being assailed by archers? The next day, a charade was staged. The duke burst into the studio with a gang of armed followers, and ran towards the bound model with threats to kill him on the spot. The model howled and frenziedly tried to burst his ropes. \"There\" said the duke to the artist, \"that's how you should be painting him.\" Whether Bonsignori considered this strategy for verisimilitude bad practice, or in bad taste, we do not know. At any rate, the Bonsignori version of St Sebastian is as calm and sexy as any other of the time.<br></p> <p>Is it the transcendent marvel of martyrdom that faith serves as an inner armoury, or anaesthetic; that God (as the medieval theologian St Thomas Aquinas argued) instils His witnesses with special strength and resistance? If that were the case, then what purpose would it serve to show the agony of any man shot at with arrows? A studio-model is not energised with divine, delirious conviction. Priests and secular authorities commissioned the image of St Sebastian because they shared a joint interest in fostering the cult of St Sebastian. For along with St Anthony, St Christopher and St Roch, St Sebastian counted as a \"thaumaturgic\" or wonder-working figure. And he was reckoned specifically efficacious against every medieval European's bete noire: the plague. Paintings of the saint are known that still carry marks of candle smoke, sure sign of a picture's one-time liturgical or votive use.<br></p> <p>It may be unwise to try to clarify the logic behind such popular-sacral traditions, but in this case some reasoning can be sketched. It goes like this. In both biblical and classical poetry (see respectively Psalm 7:13 and Homer's Iliad I, 10-68), arrows may be metaphoric for the shower or prickings of divine wrath. Bubonic plague, which left its victims scabbed and pocked all over, was often glossed by clerics as a sort of heaven-sent trial of humanity. And Sebastian offers the hope of survival. Any picture caption of St Sebastian invaded by arrows which entitles it \"The Death of St Sebastian\" is terribly careless. The power of the saint's legend lies in its association of recovery against all odds from physical ailment or assault. Hence his availability in time of epidemic outbreaks. <br></p> <p>Sebastian was invoked in this way regularly from the seventh century onwards. The report of St Sebastian delivering the citizens of Rome from some affliction in the year 680 earned him the status of Rome's third patron-protector, after saints Peter and Paul. Thereafter the medieval image of St Sebastian in any civic or sacred context can usually be taken as a marker of plague. Benozzo Gozzoli's twin images of the saint in the Tuscan town of San Gimignano, for example, are just that: commissioned in the years 1465-6, when Black Death menaced one Tuscan town after another, Gozzoli first showed Sebastian near-naked and pincushioned (at the Collegiata), then clothed and in prayer (at Sant'Agostino). \"Pincushioned\" - as the plague left the bodies of its victims spotted with multiple sores, so the exemplary pangs of St Sebastian ought to be manifold. <br></p> <p>Giovanni del Biondo's Sebastian, bristling with arrows, in a tryptych painted for the Duomo in Florence may have been precisely occasioned by a documented outbreak of Black Death or suchlike at Florence in 1376. In drastic circumstances such as these, we can imagine, aesthetic decorum might well be suspended in the cause of public health. Who cared if Sebastian looked like a hedgehog or an athlete - when, as the local poet Boccaccio claims, pigs were rummaging amid the extra-mural mass graves of the plague*s urban victims? But for all the circumstantial misery, see how the image bears up. Even when Sebastian can scarcely be seen for arrows, he keeps his cool. His blood issues only in droplets. He seems contentedly tethered at his stake. The halo burgeons about his head. He enjoys close conversation with a visiting seraph. What are we to conclude? It has been remarked, by the Italian historian Lionello Puppi, that some Renaissance painters show first-hand acquaintance with techniques of execution and torture. That is, they had sufficient opportunities provided by the penal codes of their own cities to observe the motions of flogging, hanging and decapitation. Puppi describes Domenico Beccafumi's early 16th-century picture of the execution of St Paul as \"disturbingly professional\". <br></p> <p>With St Sebastian, however, as with the Crucifixion, there was no such opportunity for a Renaissance artist to \"document\" the reality of violence. But it was not entirely unthinkable. In Vasari's time, the rumour circulated that Michelangelo had put one of his models through death by crucifixion. A story also arose regarding the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini's sojourn in Istanbul at the Ottoman court of Mehmet II, in 1479-80, wherein the Sultan, unimpressed by Bellini's rendition of the severed head of St John the Baptist, had a passing slave immediately decapitated in order to show how the neck muscles react. We may not believe such tales. But we can begin to understand how they were generated.<br></p> <p>After all, the Italian Renaissance was a place and a time when art's claim to virtual reality was dauntlessly asserted. \"Your pen will be worn out before you can fully describe what the painter can demonstrate forthwith by the aid of his science,\" boasted Leonardo da Vinci, \"and your tongue will be parched with thirst . . . before you can describe with words what a painter is able to show you in an instant.' But this was a boast too far. And the iconography of St Sebastian proves it so. For ultimately, Leonardo's artist-peers refrained from showing Sebastian in agony not because they thought him immune to pain, or else enjoying it. They may have had some inkling of what it is like to be shot through with arrows - a thorn in the foot, or a nasty splinter, if not an actual arrow. But in any case they knew what most of us know, too: the truth that pain defies description, whether in words or in images. It is an essential component of what pain is. <br></p> <p>Eastertime, and in particular Good Friday, is the occasion when the Christian calendar solicits faithful focus upon a body put through extremes of pain. Matthias Grunewald's rendering of the Crucifixion remains unparalleled as a representation of human form in a state of gradual wreckage. To know that he painted it for the altarpiece of a monastic hospital, a place where lepers might seek aid, may explain the particular stress laid by Grunewald, a contemporary of Leonardo, upon a flesh surface gone so pustulent and raw. And yet it is what it is: a representation. It may needle our conscience; it cannot do more to us than that - just as we, for our part, remain powerless to salve or save that body there. <br></p> <p>Pain's nature keeps a fortress of its own, as all migraine sufferers know. So ultimately, for the image of Christ's witness Sebastian, there was no need to show howling, or fountains of blood. Reality will always be the world's most dogged iconoclast. Art cannot express pain: it can only sublimate it. And that is one good reason for art to exist.</p>",

      "bodyText": "He juts; he pouts; he poses. The flimsiest of loincloths struggles to stay around the top of his thighs. We never glimpse him more or less than teasingly stripped. Boyish, yet muscular. Pale-skinned; slender, soft and taut. And by further schematic consent, his attitude is one of mild gyration at the midriff - just enough to make his hips incline. So he invites as he recoils. He flaunts an allure of delicious vulnerability. And, indeed, he is wounded. Quite severely, we should say. Pierced by arrows - through his lungs, his legs, his torso, his brow, and more. Sometimes the arrows are so densely clustered into his flesh he can look like a porcupine. Yet he does not split the skies with anything so unseemly as an agonised howl. He may concede a gasp or a wince. More often, though, he just purses his lips - as if for a kiss. This is the typical image of St Sebastian and it is no revelation to hail it as a gay icon. How could it not be? But the image goes far beyond that. It brings us to the bewildering place where beauty and wretchedness, delight and disgust, ecstasy and torment, all conspire to lose their normal polar opposition. A painting of St Sebastian is put on display as a work of art, an object of admiration, connoisseurship. Gallery labels tell of an artist; they may supply a provenance, too. Because this is the image of a saint, its original position to viewers was invariably in some sacred setting, with prayer or reverence the appropriate attitude of respect. But to be aware of that fact only doubles our sense of bewilderment. Pious as it once was, every picture of St Sebastian remains a full-tilt assault upon aesthetic complacency. The sort of language routinely applied to the S&amp;M photography of Robert Mapplethorpe or the art-stunts of 'Brit Art' belongs no less to the hallowed iconography of this Christian martyr. It is sensational, deplorable, macabre, and morally confused. And yet it is exquisite, too. It is a paradox that beauty can cohabit with, or arise from, grievous bodily harm, but it is not a novel problem. In the 18th century, men of letters earnestly debated whether it was right to take aesthetic delight in a classical statue showing a man and his two sons beset by giant serpents. In our own time, it is almost an annual Hollywood routine that someone in or out of the film industry will flagellate the moguls for their excess of entertaining violence. A few centuries ago, the prospect of a public execution would have emptied any London theatre. Cameramen have to work harder to conjure the same thrill of horror now; but it is all the more memorable when they do. Are we sick, to take pleasure from pain? What is the good of ghastly art? Let us see if he has the answers - this pouting, punctured Saint Sebastian. Was there ever such a person as the 'historical' Sebastian? Presumably; but - in common with the many sanctified heroes and heroines of early Christian witness - not definitively. The tale of Sebastian's testimony - the passionate insubordination of one of the emperor's close bodyguards - is chronologically located in the reign of the Roman tetrarch Diocletian, who in AD303 conducted the last campaign of Christian persecutions by imperial Rome. Sebastian, a Christian member of the elite cohort known as the Praetorian Guard, serves with honour in a promising military career, yet ultimately is forced to put his loyalty to Christ before obedience to his superiors (the joint emperors Diocletian and Maximian). His punishment is be used as target practice by his fellow guardsmen; yet Sebastian survives, and is nursed back to health by a co-believer called Irene, only to reaffirm his faith with extra vigour. Diocletian then has him flogged, or pulverised, to death within imperial precincts, and his body flung into the great sewer of Rome, the Cloaca Maxima. Somehow the corpse is recovered. Final defilement only proves another step toward the accolade of sainthood. No classical author records the episode, but this narrative is to be found in The Golden Legend (Legenda aurea) of one Jacobus da Voragine (1230-98) whose omnibus collection of saintly lives was one of the world's first best-sellers, rolling off prototype presses throughout Europe (personally translated by pioneer printer William Caxton, The Golden Legend went through nine editions in English alone between 1483 and 1527). It is true that when The Golden Legend became exposed to the learned scrutiny of Italian humanists in the late 15th century, it was held up to ridicule as a farrago of improbable evangelising antics. Still, it was the principal literary source for European painters commissioned to produce an image of St Sebastian - even if, in graphic terms, the description verged on the grotesque. It is The Golden Legend that says Sebastian \"was needled like a hedgehog with the strikes of the arrows\". That particular aspect was mostly eschewed by the artists, perhaps because it risked making a laughably odd metamorphosis of the saint who was the staunch \u00dc\"Soldier of Christ\". At the same time, The Golden Legend account of Sebastian's ordeal helps to explain the aspect of noble passivity conventionally bestowed upon the saint in art. For Jacobus allows no purple swell of empathy for the pangs of pierced Sebastian. His Sebastian does not writhe or struggle, nor scream, as the arrows puncture his flesh. Jacobus locates the firing-squad in Rome's Campus Martius, \"the Field of Mars\u00ee. Perhaps because the image is so superficially \"familiar\" to us, it is a story rarely relayed in any detail. One of those rare retellings comes in the autobiographical novel of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, Confessions Of A Mask (1949). Centuries after Jacobus, it is Mishima who most clearly voices the homoerotic response to Sebastian's distress. As a youth, he recalls, he came across a reproduction of an image of St Sebastian attributed to Guido Reni. Instinctually, the sight of the image called forth the boy's first ardent, rapid and productive act of masturbation. And it was not the last of the fascination. Later - prefiguring the suicidal act of public hara-kiri which he committed in 1970 - Mishima would imitate Sebastian's posture and punishment: such was the extent of his empathetic adoration of the saint. Mishima was a body-builder, imbued with the logic of \"no pain, no gain\"; he may also have been conditioned by a Samurai tradition of warrior-heroics with its own decorum of pain and beautified cruelty. But he was not entirely eccentric in his eroticised viewing of St Sebastian. In Leopold von Sacher-Masoch's thinly fictional fantasy Venus In Furs (1870), St Sebastian is named - along with several other spectacular Christian martyrs - as an incitement to the sexual pleasure now categorised as \"masochism\".

For once, all three were home: Tom, a student, doesn't really need an excuse not to study; Chris, an architect, has a day's holiday; and Neil, a barber, is off sick with a git of a cold and taking swigs from a bottle of Benylin in a forlorn attempt to make himself feel better.</p> <p>\"So,\" asks Rosie excitedly, \"you all cook then?\"</p> <p>\"Nah,\" replies a bunged-up Neil.</p> <p>\"I usually eat out, Chinese takeaway, or something.\" Ah, so they're not such paragons, thinks Rosie, an observation backed up by the withered pot plants in the front room.</p> <p>\"Tom fancies himself as a bit of a cook,\" says Chris, \"but us two can't do a thing, and eat anything he makes.\"</p> <p>\"Which is why we need your help,\" adds Tom, \"so I can make stuff that we can all eat as and when.\"</p> <p>\"Very commendable,\" says Rosie, before adding with motherly concern, \"those plants could do with a good watering, though.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, so that's what is wrong with them,\" says Chris, enlightened.</p> <p>\"Er, yes,\" says Rosie. \"But we're not here to talk horticulture; we've got some serious cooking to do.\"</p> <p>\"Anything you need help with?\" asks Tom eagerly as Neil and Chris take up positions on the sofa with bottles of beer and the TV remote.</p> <p>\"Sure,\" says Rosie, \"there's lots to prepare. You start with the plantain and veg for tamale pie.\" Tom sets to, while Rosie busies herself with prepping the meat dishes. \"Um, that looks a bit... rude,\" she says of Tom's rather phallic plantain-holding technique. \"How does it feel?\"</p> <p>\"Pardon!\" exclaims Tom.</p> <p>\"I didn't mean it like that,\" says Rosie. \"Is it hard or soft?\"</p> <p>\"You're doing it deliberately now,\" replies Tom.</p> <p>\"Honest, I'm not,\" says a blushing Rosie, then admits that she's never cooked plantain and is inquisitive as to its texture. \"It looks quite woody.\" Tom raises an eyebrow. \"I mean, it looks like an unripe banana.\"</p> <p>\"It's sticky, too,\" says Tom.</p> <p>\"See!\" says Rosie triumphantly. \"It's not that easy to avoid, is it?\"</p> <p>Before the dialogue descends any further into smut, Rosie volunteers Chris for the next job: \"You make the cornbread,\" she says authoritatively.</p> <p>Chris looks worried, Tom looks relieved, Neil looks ill. \"But I can't cook,\" moans Chris. \"I was Poynton's Crusty King Junior Masterchef of 1989, but that was a long time ago, and all I made was jelly.\"</p> <p>\"Cornbread's a cinch,\" says Rosie, rummaging in the cupboards and emerging with a worried look on her face. \"There seems to be a lack of basic implements, such as whisks, bowls and the like.\" The boys turn to each other nonplussed. \"Never mind,\" says Rosie, \"we'll just have to make do.\" With that, she guides Chris through the \"cinch\" that is making cornbread with none of the right equipment, then enlists Neil to complete the final stages of pie-making, amalgamating the dough and pouring it over the cooked veg; 45 minutes later, an impressive-looking pie emerges from the oven.</p> <p>\"Neil, look what you've made!\" says an amazed Tom. Neil seems rather pleased with himself, but then pleads sickness and heads back to collapse on the sofa. Rosie, charitably, does not summon him back for further chores, and instead gets Chris and Tom to prepare a salad for roast belly pork, and herbs for a spicy chicken dish. Tom, grinning, brandishes the cucumber suggestively. \"Oi, behave!\" says Rosie.</p> <p>\"Okay,\" says Tom, and changes the subject: \"So, this chicken, is it Thai, what with the chilli and coconut?\"</p> <p>\"More Balinese,\" says Rosie. \"The the concept is a bit fusiony, which I don't usually go in for because most of it is so silly. It's for when you want to impress the 'birds'.\"</p> <p>\"Like we did the other night,\" says Tom nudging Chris.</p> <p>\"Not sure they'd agree,\" says Chris.</p> <p>He and Tom sidle off to join Neil on the couch to drink yet more beer, watch daytime TV and slag off Manchester United, as you do. The abandoned KD doesn't seem to mind being left to finish off, and is soon serving up the chicken and pork dishes, along with sumptuous steak sandwiches. The three flatmates descend on the food as if they haven't eaten in a week.</p> <p>\"You should have stirred the salsa,\" says a startled Rosie.</p> <p>\"I did,\" says Tom. \"I gave it a really good toss.\"</p> <p>\"Now don't start that again!\"</p> <p><b>Tamale Pie</b><br> This recipe comes from my brother, and is, as I recall, a great pre- or post- pub dinner. He adds kidney beans to the filling, but I left them out because one of the other dishes I made for the boys has pulses in it. Serves four.</p> <p><b>For the filling</b><br> 2 onions, finely sliced<br> 3 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 1 half tbsp olive oil<br> half tsp chilli powder<br> 2 large chilli peppers (ie, the ones that are sweet and not very hot), de-seeded and finely sliced<br> 2 sticks celery, chopped<br> 1 plantain (optional), peeled, sliced down the middle and chopped<br> 100g sweetcorn<br> 45g green olives, chopped<br> 600g chopped tinned tomatoes<br> 1 heaped tbsp parsley, chopped<br> Salt and pepper<br></p> <p><b>For the cornbread topping</b><br> 185g polenta<br> 1? tbsp plain flour<br> 75g salt<br> 3 tsp baking powder<br> 2 eggs, beaten<br> 135ml milk<br> 1? tbsp olive oil<br> 75g cheddar, grated<br> 2 spring onions, finely chopped<br> 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped<br></p> <p>First, make the filling. Heat the oil in a big pan, add the onion, garlic and chilli powder, and soften for 10 minutes. Add the chilli peppers, celery and plantain, and saut\u008e for the same time. Add the olives, sweetcorn and tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Season to taste, and add the parsley. Cook gently while you preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6 and make the topping.</p> <p>In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients, including the herb, onion and cheese. Beat the egg, milk and oil together in a jug. Make a well in the centre of the dry mix, pour in the liquid and stir until you have a good dough.</p> <p>Pour the filling into a large oven dish, pour over the cornbread mix and smooth out. Bake in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes, until the bread topping is golden and set.</p> <p><b>Spicy fried chicken</b><br> This should appeal to anyone who likes crispy fried chicken. Also, most of the preparation is done in advance. These quantities will serve four, or six if served with one of the accompaniments listed afterwards.</p> <p>420ml tinned coconut milk<br> 1 lime, zest grated<br> 2 lime leaves (optional)<br> 15g fresh ginger, peeled and diced<br> 4 cloves garlic, crushed<br> 4 shallots, finely chopped<br> 5 small green chillies, de-seeded and chopped fine<br> 6 coriander stalks<br> 1 half tsp turmeric<br> Big pinch salt<br> 8 free-range organic chicken thighs, skin on<br> Sunflower oil, for frying<br></p> <p>Pour the coconut milk into a large pan, then add one and a half times the amount of water. Add the lime zest, lime leaves, ginger, garlic, shallots, chillies, coriander and turmeric, and bring up to a simmer. Season the chicken with salt, and poach gently in the liquor until just cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon, and set aside to cool.</p> <p>When it's time to eat, heat enough oil in a frying pan to shallow fry the chicken (around 1-2cm). Lay in the thighs skin-side down, turn after five or so minutes, when crisp and golden, and cook for a few minutes more until done. Serve with the following two dishes and a bowl of chilli sauce.</p> <p><b>Coconut rice and beans</b><br> It would be a real waste not to make use of the delicious cooking liquor from the chicken, so I came up with this simple and tasty side dish to do complement the crispy fowl. Serves six.</p> <p>1 onion, sliced<br> 1 small green pepper, sliced<br> 1 tbsp groundnut oil<br> 400g long grain rice<br> 400g tin black-eye beans<br> 1 big handful each fresh coriander and parsley, roughly chopped<br> Salt<br></p> <p>Heat the oil in a big pan, add the onion and pepper, and soften for 10 minutes. Add the rice and stir. Measure out one litre of the chicken cooking liquor, bits and all. Check for seasoning, add to the pan, stir, and simmer, covered, for 12 minutes. Test the rice, and if it's almost ready (which it should be; if not, carry on cooking a little longer), stir in the beans, together with a little more cooking liquor if the rice is on the dry side. Allow the beans a few minutes to heat through, then stir in the herbs and serve straight away.</p> <p><b>Avocado salad</b><br> The idea for this dish came to me when I was reading a recipe for Caribbean rice that suggested serving radishes, cucumber and avocado alongside.</p> <p>1 red onion, finely diced<br> 1 lime, zested<br> 1 and a half limes, juiced<br> half tsp salt<br> 6 radishes, diced<br> 1 small piece cucumber, de-seeded and finely chopped<br> 1 large ripe avocado, peeled and finely chopped<br> 1 handful fresh coriander<br></p> <p>Place the lime juice in a bowl, add the salt, stirring to dissolve, then add the lime zest and onion. Five minutes before serving, add the remaining ingredients, give it all a good stir, a grind of black pepper and a little more salt, if needed.</p> <p><b>Marinated steak sandwich with onions and peppers </b><br> The beef can be marinated for several days and cooked as and when. Ditto the onions, which can be reheated in the steak pan while the meat rests.</p> <p>The good thing about marinating meat is that you can use an inexpensive cut. I'd favour skirt, but I had to buy something called 'frying steak' from Chris, Tom and Neil's local supermarket. Serves four.</p> <p>950g steak<br> 1 bottle hefty red wine<br> 6 cloves garlic, crushed<br> Salt and pepper<br> 1 loaf crusty white bread, sliced<br> 3 tbsp olive oil<br> 4 onions<br> 3 red onions<br> 1 tsp sugar<br> 100g roasted red peppers (buy a jar to save time)<br> 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br> 1 sprig thyme<br> 1 small bayleaf<br></p> <p>Mix together the wine, garlic, half a tablespoon of olive oil, bayleaf and lots of black pepper, and then add alternate layers of steak and onions. Cover and marinate for a couple of hours. Lift out the onions, and turn over the meat so it gets a good even dip.</p> <p>Heat one and a half tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan, add the onions and thyme, cover with a tight lid and leave to sweat down over a very gentle heat for about 40 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the onions are very soft). Add the sugar, raise the heat for a few minutes to caramelise a little, then add a couple of tablespoons of the marinade and the vinegar. Reduce the liquor until it just coats the onions. Taste for seasoning, stir in the peppers and it is ready to serve or store in the fridge.</p> <p>Now for the meat. If you have left it in the marinade for a day or two, take it out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking. Lift the meat from the marinade, season to taste, then lay in a very hot griddle pan or heavy-based frying pan. The idea is to sear the meat until it has a nice brown exterior, then flip it over and do the same on the other side. Remove from the pan, and leave to rest in a warm place while you reheat the oniony gear.</p> <p>Drizzle olive oil over your slices of bread (put a few rocket leaves on the base, too, if you want), then slice the steak, pour any juices over the bread, lay in some meat and onions, and top with another slice of oil-drizzled bread.</p> <p><b>Crisp pork belly salad with blood oranges</b><br> I came across blood oranges in Unicorn, a wonderful organic shop we found in Chorlton, 10 minutes from the boys' flat, and just had to buy some. Serves four.</p> <p>500g belly pork<br> 3 blood oranges <br> 1-2 tbsp fresh basil<br> 2 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes<br> 100g French beans<br> 15g pinenuts, toasted; watch them very carefully as they burn easily <br> 1 tbsp Dijon mustard<br> Salt and pepper<br> 100ml olive oil<br> Selection of salad leaves (watercress, in particular, is a fine complement to orange)<br></p> <p>Slash the skin of the pork with a knife and rub it with a generous amount of coarse salt. Grate the zest of one orange over the meat, strew over a few torn basil leaves, and press them in gently. If possible, leave the meat to sit for an hour or two before cooking.</p> <p>Blanch the beans for a couple of minutes in salted water, then drain, refresh in cold water and set to one side. Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/ gas mark 7. Put the meat on a baking tray, skin-side up, and cook at the top of the oven for about 40 minutes, until the skin is good and crispy, then leave to rest. About 25 minutes into roasting, drain off the fat, pass it through a fine sieve and add a couple of tablespoons to a frying pan. In this, saut\u008e the potato over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, and season.</p> <p>Meanwhile, make the dressing: peel the two remaining oranges, and cut the flesh into segments, reserving any juices. Juice the grated orange and add this to the juice from preparing the others: you should have around 50ml. Put the mustard in a bowl, stir in the juice, then gradually add the oil. Season, and add the rest of the basil. If the dressing is too sweet, add a tablespoon of vinegar (cider would be best).</p> <p>To serve, place the leaves, pinenuts, beans and orange segments in a large bowl, season and mix gently. Drain the potatoes on kitchen paper, and add these to the salad mixture along with a generous amount of dressing, and toss. Slice the pork into good-sized chunks, and lay on top of the salad</p> <p>Do you have a culinary dilemma that needs the Kitchen Doctor's expert treatment?

But that's exactly what Tom Sabin, Chris Crookes and Neil O'Donnell wanted Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, to do for them. \"I'm one of three hard-working lads,\" wrote Tom, \"and like to cook when I have time. Our problem is having nutritious meals available for us all to feast on at short notice due to our differing schedules. If we could have great food in the fridge to pick up and reheat, or quick, fresh cooking, that would be great.\" No sooner had she finished reading than the KD was making her way to the boys' flat in Hulme, Manchester, eager to meet such rare examples of post-teen manhood. For once, all three were home: Tom, a student, doesn't really need an excuse not to study; Chris, an architect, has a day's holiday; and Neil, a barber, is off sick with a git of a cold and taking swigs from a bottle of Benylin in a forlorn attempt to make himself feel better. \"So,\" asks Rosie excitedly, \"you all cook then?\" \"Nah,\" replies a bunged-up Neil. \"I usually eat out, Chinese takeaway, or something.\" Ah, so they're not such paragons, thinks Rosie, an observation backed up by the withered pot plants in the front room. \"Tom fancies himself as a bit of a cook,\" says Chris, \"but us two can't do a thing, and eat anything he makes.\" \"Which is why we need your help,\" adds Tom, \"so I can make stuff that we can all eat as and when.\" \"Very commendable,\" says Rosie, before adding with motherly concern, \"those plants could do with a good watering, though.\" \"Oh, so that's what is wrong with them,\" says Chris, enlightened. \"Er, yes,\" says Rosie. \"But we're not here to talk horticulture; we've got some serious cooking to do.\" \"Anything you need help with?\" asks Tom eagerly as Neil and Chris take up positions on the sofa with bottles of beer and the TV remote. \"Sure,\" says Rosie, \"there's lots to prepare.

      "bodyText": "More than a million adults who are suffering from a crippling disorder which can lead to criminal behaviour are being overlooked because doctors believe the condition is confined to childhood, it was claimed yesterday. A leading forensic psychologist, Susan Young, told the British Psychological Society's annual conference in Glasgow yesterday that as much as 3% of the adult population could have attention defecit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These people, however, are not receiving essential treatment and medication because many psychiatrists and psychologists believe children grow out of the disorder. Dr Young, of the Institute of Psychiatry, said some studies estimate the condition - which is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness - may affect up to 25% of the prison population. Little work has been done on the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood, but Dr Young said that 6% of children have the disorder and around half of them will carry it through to adulthood. \"I think what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. We cannot possibly have identified all the adults in the population with ADHD.\" ADHD in adults can be treated successfully with the controversial drug Ritalin - which has been heavily criticised over its effect on children - but adult patients can often become depressed and need additional psychological help. Dr Young studied 30 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD later in life and compared their progress with a group of 30 adults who had other personality problems, but not ADHD, and a group of 30 \"normal\" adults. All of the people involved in the survey were from middle class backgrounds and were of average intelligence. But Dr Young found \"huge differences\" in their lifestyles. Around one third of ADHD sufferers had attended special schools for children with learning difficulties against only 7% of those with other personality disorders. No one from the \"normal\" group had gone to a special school. People with ADHD also found it much more difficult to hold down jobs and two thirds were unemployed, compared to only 3% of the \"normal\" group. They also had severe social problems and had difficulty forming friendships. Dr Young also found that 25% of people with ADHD had been to prison. \"They were stealing, fire-setting, being cruel to animals - all the way up to homicide,\" she added. Dr Young set up the first clinic for adults with ADHD at Maudsley hospital, south London, in 1994. There is only one other specialist clinic in the UK. \u0095 Simple relaxation and hypnotherapy techniques could extend the lives of lymphatic cancer patients by up to 32 months, according to new research by a team of psychologists led by Leslie Walker, of Hull University. The psychological therapies were administered to help the patients deal with nausea, vomiting and other side effects inherent in chemotherapy. But the researchers found that, not only did the treatments reduce nausea and vomiting, the patients also survived longer. When they looked at the patients 13 years on, those who had been given relaxation therapy survived for an average of 104.5 months and those who had hypnotherapy and relaxation therapy survived for 125.8 months.

He says it was after her birthday in November; she says it was in December when she agreed to meet him at a hotel after he went to his work's party. Whatever the case, by New Year's Day, he had walked out on his wife and young daughter and son. The two families, who lived side by side in a terraced row, had been close and Mr Hone had built a pathway linking both gardens, so that their children could play together.</p> <p>The pair began a sexual relationship and used only the withdrawal method during intercourse. Soon Ms Hansell, who has a four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, was pregnant. Mr Hone says he was overjoyed. She says she was not.

The pair sat through all the interviews together, and she signed the consent form for the abortion. He claims that he believed they were just confirming the pregnancy; she says he has had children before and knows that this is \"nonsense\".</p> <p>After the visit to the clinic, Mr Hone began to read books on abortion and studied American anti-abortion websites. He contacted the anti-abortion group Life, which put him in touch with the Pro-Life Alliance. \"If it hadn't been for the Pro-Life Alliance I would never have been in court,\" he says. \"I wasn't so vocally anti-abortion. It was after I read more about it. When I found out about the abortion I couldn't believe it. She has murdered our child. It's not just her body, it's the child's body as well - it's an innocent child's body.\"</p> <p>Last week, when Mr Hone discovered that the abortion had taken place, he decided to pursue the foetal remains. Sitting in a deckchair in his rented house, where a picture of a baby sits on the mantelpiece in a silver frame, he says: \"I want to be able to bury my son or daughter. I want to know that it's not going to some lab rat to be tested on or chucked in a skip. I will have a funeral and say goodbye to it and then get on with my life.

Ernie Gordon Swaffham, Norfolk \u0095 Our local Tory party news-letter claims Oxford is a \"soft touch\" for asylum seekers. This makes it difficult for Conservative central office to claim the Dagenham Tories' leaflet is an isolated incident (Tory leaflets inflame race issue, March 29). Dominic and Lucy Vickers Oxford \u0095 Presumably the reason the plague of foot and mouth has been visited upon us is that the prime minister has been skimping on his prayers (Blair puts his faith in religious partners, March 30). David Ross London \u0095 Is there any significance in the fact that former MI5 director general Stella Rimington is a director of Marks and Spencer - a floundering entity with a glorious past but, apparently, no future?

      "body": "<b>Why online bank transfer has put me off</b> <p>I recently moved some funds from an on-line account at NatWest to an e-savings account at Nationwide. The NatWest website told me that I first had to add the Nationwide account to my list of \"beneficiaries\". </p> <p> This took two days. I then tried to pay the funds to my new beneficiary, only to be told that the amount to be transferred \"exceeded the payment limit\", without saying what the limit was, or why! Eventually, by trial and error I managed to break the sum down into three separate payments, acceptable even though all three were sanctioned within a minute of each other. The website then told me that these payments would take four days to reach their destination. </p> <p>What it didn't add was that my NatWest account would be debited immediately, the money sent to languish in cyberspace or, I suspect, in an interest-bearing holding account. The transfer took me six days, I lost four days interest on the money, and I did all the work. Online banking? We're being taken for a ride! <br><b> IB</b> <br> Leicestershire </p> <p>\u0095 At NatWest, there are two ways that an online banking customer can set up a payment to a third party. The first is via an online 'form' that generally takes 24-48 hours to set up as the details are checked first in the back office. </p> <p>The other way is by telephone banking and is generally slightly faster as the details are checked while the customer is on the phone. So if you want to speed things up next time, you know what to do. </p> <p>The bank's payment limit, which it says is sufficient for over 95% of its personal and small business customers, is not publicised for security reasons. </p> <p>But, you are right, it does not have system limits for multiple payments so customers can get round this by breaking up a large sum that exceeds the payment limit into several smaller payments. </p> <p>On the four-day transfer, NatWest says the payment goes through the normal three-day clearing cycle just as a cheque would and is processed by BACS.</p> <p><b> What savings plan for a grandchild </b></p> <p> I am shortly to become a grandparent for the first time. I want to set up a savings plan for the baby that can't be touched until she or he reaches 18 or 21. I can only afford \u00a325 a month so our independent financial adviser is not interested. <br><b> KS</b><br> North Yorkshire </p> <p>\u0095 A friendly society plan would suit your book - and your budget. They have a maximum \u00a325 a month, are totally tax free, and can be arranged so that the child cannot touch the money until adulthood. They must run for at least 10 years. </p> <p>If your IFA is not interested, try another. They earn around \u00a360 from the sale. Leading friendly society names include Family Assurance, Tunbridge Wells, Homeowners and Shepherds - the last named offers free \"treats\" such as visits to theme parks and Christmas parties to young policyholders. </p> <p> <b> Is mortgage exit penalty correct? </b></p> <p> A close friend has had a \u00a327,000 Halifax mortgage since 1996. Now she's married with a child, they need a larger home. With her husband, she applied to the Halifax for a \u00a390,000 loan. But the Halifax branch said she would have to pay a \u00a31,000 exit penalty as she was \"breaking her original agreement\". Please tell me this is a mistake! <br><b>IW</b><br> Somerset </p> <p>\u0095 It is a mistake. She would only have to fork out the \u00a31,000 if she left the Halifax. Halifax loans with penalties are \"portable\" - they move with you. Borrowers who want to trade up can mix'n'match - in this case, your friend could keep her \u00a327,000 fixed rate and take out another \u00a363,000 Halifax loan from the bank's range. This second loan could be variable rate, discounted, capped or fixed. </p> <p> <b> Daily v. annual rates of interest </b></p> <p> There has been a lot of fuss in some newspapers about how we're being ripped off by mortgage lenders who charge annual interest. We're told daily interest is better. But surely it all depends on interest rates and how you repay? <br><b>TK</b><br> Birmingham </p> <p>\u0095 You're right. If the interest rates are the same, \"daily rest\" - to use the trade term - is cheaper. But if the annual interest rate is 0.15% or more lower - on your current mortgage - you save money with the old method unless you make several small irregular payments. Even banks using the annual method will reduce the balance outstanding if you deposit a minimum extra sum - usually \u00a3250 or \u00a3500. For most people, it is the monthly bill rather than the interest rate or method of computation that counts. </p> <p> <b> How can I combat windfall loss? </b></p> <p> My Standard Life 10-year endowment is about to mature. One option is continuing with Standard Life via a with-profits bond. I would keep voting rights but that would mean I could lose out on a future windfall as these are based on the length of the policy. How can you combat this unfairness? <br><b>AH</b><br> Derbyshire </p> <p>\u0095 If you stick with Standard Life, your membership would be reborn rather than continued. The rule banning new policyholders from windfalls would not apply to you. Any payments are compensation for the remaining life of a contract because demutualisation typically reduces with-profits payouts by 10%. The bond has no set life and no contractual period so the basis for compensation would be different in this case. </p> <p><b> Egg that's taken months to boil </b></p> <p> Attracted by seeing the Boots Advantage Egg Visa Card featured consistently on your \"best buy\" table, I applied for one online just after Xmas. I was given the OK almost instantaneously and a paper application form followed within several days, which I returned by mid January. </p> <p>After four weeks having heard nothing I contacted Egg, which told me that the paper application must have got lost. It sent me another which I returned by mid February. Boots Egg advertising says that the card will be delivered within 10 working days of them receiving the forms. </p> <p>The direct debit instruction was set up on February 22 and a PIN arrived the next week. On enquiring again, I was told that my card should arrive by March 8 which it did not. When I contacted Egg again on March 11, it said it would order me another card. </p> <p>It's now March 21 and I still have no card. I wonder if Boots Egg is a victim of its own success and unable to keep up with the demand for this card? I also wonder whether the offer of six months at 0% interest will be two months by the time I receive mine! <br><b>GL</b><br> Sheffield</p> <p>\u0095 Boots and Egg extend their apologies and are emphatic that cases like yours are extremely rare. They say they are coping well with demand and are generally having no problem getting cards to applicants within the promised 10 days. </p> <p>What's more worrying in your case, however, is that it's almost unheard of for a customer to receive a PIN before they receive their card. For security reasons, Egg always sends out a card before the associated PIN, so the implication is that someone could have intercepted your card. For this reason an Egg official will be contacting you and sorting out your case personally. And rest assured, the six months at 0% introductory offer will start only once you have received your card. </p> <p> <b> Tax on estate when you die abroad </b></p> <p> My father moved to Australia four years before his death and took out two Australian pension schemes. One of them (scheme A) was a private scheme and the other (scheme B) was operated via his employer. The trustees of scheme A accepted that my father's partner was an eligible dependant and paid her a lump sum at their discretion. </p> <p>But the trustees of scheme B did not accept this and, there being no other dependants, the payment was made to the estate. Though he died abroad, he was UK domiciled and therefore his estate is being taxed here. The Capital Tax Office argue that the benefits paid under both schemes are liable for inheritance tax because they were not UK-approved schemes and therefore are treated as gifts with reservation. </p> <p>Is its argument correct or do you think some or all of the money should be exempt from tax? <br><b> RM</b><br> Hertfordshire</p> <p>\u0095 Inheritance tax specialists at accountants Ernst &amp; Young say the Capital Tax Office's decision sounds correct. </p> <p>Whether the pension in question is Australian or UK based is largely irrelevant. It all boils down to the powers the trustees do or don't have to give pension benefits to a specified person. If this is not in their remit, the money becomes part of the estate and consequently liable to inheritance tax, provided of course that the estate exceeds the IHT threshold (\u00a3234,000 in the 2000/2001 tax year). </p> <p>It sounds as if the Inland Revenue may have challenged the discretionary power of the scheme A trustees to pay benefits to your father's partner. But, without knowing all the details, it is impossible to say whether this challenge is worth questioning. To take things further you would need to get professional help from a qualified tax adviser. </p> <p> <b> Should we dump our endowment? </b></p> <p> We've got an Equitable Life endowment to pay off our mortgage - taken out in December 1997. My shaky knowledge of the Halifax takeover is that it hasn't taken over the endowments bit. Our instinct is to sell up, change to a repayment mortgage and get term assurance instead. <br><b>BW</b><br> Brighton </p> <p>&amp;149; # In fact, Halifax swallowed Equitable Life's entire with-profits fund, including endowments, which will be handled by its subsidiary, Clerical Medical. The fund is currently invested largely in gilts. You should wait to see if it is allowed to invest more in equities again before making a decision. Selling up will realise very little return. You could switch to a repayment mortgage and keep your endowment free standing, but you stand to lose almost all your three-year investment.</p>",

Good managers, in contrast, trust their colleagues, keep them informed and give them a chance to play a role in solving problems.</p> <p>Training budgets are often among the first items to be reviewed when conditions tighten. Sharp cutbacks can harm performance in the short and long term. Precious skills erode, while talented people see the writing on the wall and seek better outlets for their abilities.</p> <p>The first victims of any decline in capability are customers. Just when they expect more for their money, they get less. Customer care is vital as markets tighten. Many firms, however, make the mistake of conceding quality for quantity in busi ness development. This creates opportunities for \"vulture marketing\". Vulture marketers seek out rivals that ignore the needs of existing, quality clients in favour of new customers. They circle above, watching as buyers become impatient with deteriorating service - then strike.</p> <p>A powerful market focus calls for more than direct customer care.

Organisations play a vital role in the communities they serve. Last week's Association of Chartered Certified Accountants UK environmental reporting awards showed how large companies such as Shell International and small firms like Bovince combined good business performance with environmental responsibility.</p> <p>In a global marketplace, this challenge to business goes further. The recent African Leaders programme organised by the British Council highlighted the potential of the new generation of African leaders and their need for help in transforming their economies. The acid test of globalisation is whether organisations sustain their investment.</p> <p>Evidence from the past is that these people-centred attitudes are jettisoned when conditions get tough. Harsher times shifted the emphasis to resource management, budgets and controls.</p> <p>The test of the new leaders is their ability to balance these priorities.</p> <p>Professor Tom Cannon is chief executive of Respect London</p>",

Good managers, in contrast, trust their colleagues, keep them informed and give them a chance to play a role in solving problems. Training budgets are often among the first items to be reviewed when conditions tighten. Sharp cutbacks can harm performance in the short and long term. Precious skills erode, while talented people see the writing on the wall and seek better outlets for their abilities. The first victims of any decline in capability are customers. Just when they expect more for their money, they get less. Customer care is vital as markets tighten. Many firms, however, make the mistake of conceding quality for quantity in busi ness development. This creates opportunities for \"vulture marketing\". Vulture marketers seek out rivals that ignore the needs of existing, quality clients in favour of new customers. They circle above, watching as buyers become impatient with deteriorating service - then strike. A powerful market focus calls for more than direct customer care. Innovation is perhaps even more important. One of the oldest, recorded examples of success during difficult conditions is the story of Vickers during the recession of the 1880s. Tom Vickers, the founder, was asked why the company prospered, when so many of its rivals failed. He replied that they had \"innovated a way through it, exploiting rather than mislaying their technical strengths\". New value-added products and services allied to the constant improvement in production processes are essential. Innovation is a crucial factor in business success, but it cannot be confined to products, processes or markets. Organisations play a vital role in the communities they serve. Last week's Association of Chartered Certified Accountants UK environmental reporting awards showed how large companies such as Shell International and small firms like Bovince combined good business performance with environmental responsibility. In a global marketplace, this challenge to business goes further. The recent African Leaders programme organised by the British Council highlighted the potential of the new generation of African leaders and their need for help in transforming their economies. The acid test of globalisation is whether organisations sustain their investment. Evidence from the past is that these people-centred attitudes are jettisoned when conditions get tough. Harsher times shifted the emphasis to resource management, budgets and controls. The test of the new leaders is their ability to balance these priorities.

Managers swap roles with other managers, join them at their work and then act as hosts in return, giving each side an insight into how the other works.

This is followed by training in observation, which clarifies for the manager how they construct their observations about other people and what they read into situations. For a manager facing change, a merger or takeover, for example, lead2lead can give experience with another manager who has already faced and dealt with the same issues. Gosling cites managers from a European power company who were facing deregulation and who learned from others who had already been through this change and were now operating in the commercial world. James Patterson, who is in charge of management development programmes at AstraZeneca, took part in an exchange with human resources executive Kerry Chandler while they were both doing their IMPM. \"You have to decide what kind of experience would be useful for you,\" he explains. \"I was running a large department with 70 people and I was interested in meeting someone who had had to deal with lots of change. Kerry was in charge of HR at Motorola at the time. She was interested in our career plan and personal development.\" He spent five days in the US with Kerry - she has since moved on to IBM - and describes the experience as \"particularly special\". He explains: \"The idea is that you go and literally sit in with them and live with them doing their job. You get an insight into the company's culture and the hierarchy and real insights into how the other person sees their role in the organisation and how the organisation sees their role.\" As close observers, the exchange managers can assist each other with suggestions and Patterson says that if the partners are reasonably perceptive and responsive, a genuine bond is created. The companies also benefit from close links and ongoing relationships with other companies that have been involved in the exchange. AstraZeneca has since developed connections with IBM through Kerry and the Royal Bank of Canada. \u0095 For further information visit Lead2lead or write to Jonathan Gosling, director, Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster LA1 4YX or email gosling@lead2lead.net",

It produces 50 individual titles, including Target Law, Target Construction and Target Engineer; 650,000 copies of careers guides are distributed in total.</p> <p>His idea was simply to come up with a careers advice publication that would be the vehicle for prospective employers, alongside independent editorial, which would be distributed to appropriate university careers offices and undergraduates around the UK. The publication would be targeted to a specific career.

Blythe says: \"I had lots of big breaks but I think the best one was meeting Adrian Wood, a fellow rower at the university rowing club, and telling him about my plans.

He brought solid Yorkshire principles of thinking things through.\"</p> <p>A third partner was co-opted because he owned a computer.

They carried on their lectures in the day and planned their company by night. \"To be quite honest, none of us could necessarily write but we briefed other people to do it and we edited. We managed to blag a design student from university to do the desktop publishing,\" recalls Blythe.</p> <p>The next big break was Blythe's summer job. His property company employers loved the idea so much that they let him work from their offices to drum up business. The first issue, aimed at chartered surveyors, was put together at the beginning of their final year. They drove around the country delivering it by hand to the universities to save money on postage.</p> <p>At that stage Blythe admits the thought of making a real business wasn't uppermost in their minds. \"It was still a bit of a laugh, just something to do,\" he recalls. But the career guide for chartered surveyors made an agreeable profit and they began to realise that this idea could be rolled out into other subject areas. In between doing their finals they added construction, civil engineering and food titles to their list.</p> <p>Did they work every hour? \"We did work very hard and our social lives suffered,\" says Blythe. After university, both Blythe and Wood were offered jobs by clients who had advertised in their publications. But they turned them down and carried on playing with GTI.</p> <p>Blythe, 34, feels the defining moment which transformed GTI from a hobby into a proper business was when it entered the legal market in 1993. \"This was an area with masses of competitors and 10 times as many students.

Yes, it's Reg Presley, the UFO-loving leader of the Troggs, the man who has spent much of his fortune hoping to prove that crop circles are created by visitors from another planet. \"I wrote it originally for Euro 2000,\" he tells me. \"What I wanted was a tribal effort, something people could relate to in the primordial state they get into at football matches. Trouble was the company I was releasing it through went into liquidation before the tournament and it was too late to release it with someone else. So I was left with it. I was wondering what to do with it when a friend who was into football told me Manchester United have about 50m fans. I'm never shy of an opportunity so I thought they might like to make it their official song. It's got this penny whistle and drum vibe about it, which I imagine in my mind as your red coats marching into battle. Now wouldn't that look terrific on the pitch before a big game?\" And you imagine Sir Alex would be thrilled to watch a few hundred drummers in fancy dress re-enacting the American war of independence while churning up his greensward. Still, if Fergie is taken by the number's naggingly catchy chorus, maybe Reg could use the royalties to combine his two interests and fund research into the most compelling question of our times: when aliens arrive from Planet Zorg to stamp around in the corn making those esoteric patterns from the cover of Led Zeppelin albums, will they turn out to be Manchester United fans?",

      "body": "<p>As Owl and Blade prepare to joust in the Steel City's 100th league derby, it was strangely appropriate that Peter Shreeves, Sheffield Wednesday's perennial caretaker manager, spent yesterday being overshadowed once again. \"You can sit next to me,\" he said to his midfielder Trond Egil Soltvedt before facing the press, \"but you'll show me up. You're too good-looking.\" </p> <p>Having assisted David Pleat and Ron Atkinson in south Yorkshire, Shreeves has more recently become Wednesday's own temporary Red Adair. Yet the majority of tomorrow's 39,800 sell-out crowd, the biggest of the Nationwide League season, will be singing the caretaker's name. The second fiddle is on the verge of being given an orchestra to lead. </p> <p>\"I think I'm making a fair fist of the job,\" said the 60-year-old who, from near certainties for a second successive relegation, has inspired Wednesday to six wins in eight. \"First and foremost I have to keep the club up and, whatever the result on Sunday, that will not be determined. Many a favourite has come round Tattenham Corner in the derby only to finish sixth. So my future won't be decided, but I'm comfortable with that situation.\" </p> <p>The supporters clearly are not. \"He should be at least given first refusal on the job and it should be done now,\" said Barry Birks, chairman of the Wednesday Independent Supporters' Association. \"Any delay could be represented as a real slap in the face and he's done a superb job. He should have been given the position before Paul Jewell.\" </p> <p>The Owls' transformation has been remarkable. On being promoted from assistant manager after Jewell's dismissal six weeks ago, Shreeves was set the goal of First Division survival. For a club who had just spent nine seasons in the top flight, that should not have sounded outlandish but, crippled by debt and playing to a half-empty stadium, Wednesday appeared to be sinking fast. </p> <p>A horrendous start to the campaign left them at the foot; a brief revival towards the end of October flickered and died, swamped in gloomy defeats made all the more galling by Sheffield United's surge towards the play-offs. </p> <p>The shambles in which Shreeves found the team smacked of last season's traumas, when he oversaw the last 11 games of Wednesday's doomed Premiership existence. Now, after 19 points from a possible 24, Wednesday look down on the relegation scrap from the giddy heights of 15th. </p> <p>\"They were heading for the Conference with no money under Jewell,\" said Joe Ashton, MP for Bassetlaw whose public criticism of the then manager Danny Wilson polarised the Owls' support last season. \"But everyone expected things to get better under Peter. His record at Wednesday has been exemplary - he was Pleat's assistant when we finished seventh in the Premiership - and he never had any problem handling Paolo di Canio or Benito Carbone. They knew Peter was good. </p> <p>\"The old coaches survive in the game because they know their stuff. When people like Danny Wilson talk to players some of them must just ask: 'What do you know? You're younger than my dad'.\" </p> <p>\"Players always want you to get the job when you are winning,\" cautioned Shreeves. \"It's when you're getting beaten that there are whispers in the corridor. The biggest factor in the turnaround has been our determination not to come second. We've got stickability.\" </p> <p>Thankfully such obduracy comes cheap. With the club still an estimated \u00a312m in debt, Andy Booth was sold for \u00a3200,000 on deadline day and Wim Jonk, Gilles de Bilde, Kevin Pressman and Andy Hinchcliffe will leave on Bosman transfers in the summer. But Shreeves persuaded Coventry to loan him Carlton Palmer, who played 205 games for Wednesday earlier in his career, and Soltvedt arrived from Southampton for free. </p> <p>\"They have been massive for us,\" said the manager. \"I remember the bus journey back from Wimbledon - Paul's last game in charge - after we'd been beaten 4-1 and were on the floor. We were on our mobiles desperately trying to get Trond and Carlton in. They make my job so much easier. If a player appears to be slacking, he gets a verbal torrent from Carlton.\" </p> <p>One suspects there will be no shortage of gee-ups from the former England midfielder tomorrow as United, still in contention for a play-off place, storm Hillsborough. Although it will be Shreeves's first all-Sheffield affair in sole charge, it is by no means his first derby: in 1985 he took his Tottenham side to Arsenal and won 2-1 to stay top of the league. </p> <p>\"It's normally a frenzy of local pride and passion,\" he said. \"But it's the quieter moments, the flashes of skill, that win you derby games. One fan from Sheffield came up to me the other day and said he'd trade in the last four results for a win against United. I had to disagree with him, but then I am the manager, aren't I?\"</p>",

He said: \"Too many people in today's world never have enough time to stop and think about anyone but themselves and, hopefully, this clock may remind us all that there are more important things in life than clock-watching.\" Taylor's design places the numbers in random order and includes the handwritten legend: \"Who cares?

Fans are invited to \"join the 'English madam' for an unforgettable evening full of stories from the woman the establishment loved to hate - author, politician, inmate and more famously the best hostess in London.\" The Diary, of course, would never stoop so low as to point out Coventry's current inability to score in one of Ms Payne's establishments. </p> <p><strong>Word of the week comes from a surprising source. Full marks to Strathclyde police for the first recorded use of \"Sammarinese\" in a UK press statement. Obviously they don't read the Scotsman, where \"San Marinans\" is the preferred usage. </strong></p> <p>Terry McDermott, interviewed in Tuesday's Newcastle Evening Chronicle, claims controversially that Alan Shearer \"can appear desperately boring on telly\". However, he may soon reveal more of his vivacious off-screen personality. \"He's working at things,\" Terry reveals. \"He phones me when I'm in bed now to say: 'Did you see that telly interview? I cracked a couple of funnies!'\" A fantastic Diary prize will go to any reader who can send us an example of a Shearer TV \"funny\". </p> <p><strong>Ian Joyce writes to share memories of inappropriate pre-match music at Hereford. The players' entry to the field, he says, used to be announced by Lobo's Me And You And a Dog Named Boo. A sarcastic nod to the size of the crowd, perhaps. </strong></p> <p>Last week we claimed that Bury had played God Save The Queen before their memorable Festival of Britain match against Rapid Vienna. Reader Dave Goodacre correctly chides us that 1951 was, in fact, before the old King died. \"I do not suppose for one minute that I am the only sad anorak among your readers to point this out,\" he says. Actually Dave, you are. </p> <p><strong>A notable contribution to the annals of quirky football violence last weekend, as 40 fans of Gresford Athletic and Cogan Coronation battled it out when their teams met in the FAW Trophy semi-finals at Caersws.

      "bodyText": "Graham Taylor was one of several football personalities asked to design a \"celebrity clock\" for an internet charity auction this week (list.auctions.yahoo.com/uk, though his was sold last night). He said: \"Too many people in today's world never have enough time to stop and think about anyone but themselves and, hopefully, this clock may remind us all that there are more important things in life than clock-watching.\" Taylor's design places the numbers in random order and includes the handwritten legend: \"Who cares? We do.\" He'll be missed. The air will be thick with innuendo at Highfield Road on April 26 when Cynthia Payne is the guest at Ladies' Evening in the Premier Suite (or possibly by then the Nationwide Suite). Fans are invited to \"join the 'English madam' for an unforgettable evening full of stories from the woman the establishment loved to hate - author, politician, inmate and more famously the best hostess in London.\" The Diary, of course, would never stoop so low as to point out Coventry's current inability to score in one of Ms Payne's establishments. Word of the week comes from a surprising source. Full marks to Strathclyde police for the first recorded use of \"Sammarinese\" in a UK press statement. Obviously they don't read the Scotsman, where \"San Marinans\" is the preferred usage. Terry McDermott, interviewed in Tuesday's Newcastle Evening Chronicle, claims controversially that Alan Shearer \"can appear desperately boring on telly\". However, he may soon reveal more of his vivacious off-screen personality. \"He's working at things,\" Terry reveals. \"He phones me when I'm in bed now to say: 'Did you see that telly interview? I cracked a couple of funnies!'\" A fantastic Diary prize will go to any reader who can send us an example of a Shearer TV \"funny\". Ian Joyce writes to share memories of inappropriate pre-match music at Hereford. The players' entry to the field, he says, used to be announced by Lobo's Me And You And a Dog Named Boo. A sarcastic nod to the size of the crowd, perhaps. Last week we claimed that Bury had played God Save The Queen before their memorable Festival of Britain match against Rapid Vienna. Reader Dave Goodacre correctly chides us that 1951 was, in fact, before the old King died. \"I do not suppose for one minute that I am the only sad anorak among your readers to point this out,\" he says. Actually Dave, you are. A notable contribution to the annals of quirky football violence last weekend, as 40 fans of Gresford Athletic and Cogan Coronation battled it out when their teams met in the FAW Trophy semi-finals at Caersws. It all started, it seems, after a Gresford fan hit someone over the head with his crutch. Things then got rapidly out of hand. \"A police dog was dispatched to the ground to try and deal with the trouble,\" one report said, although without mentioning how it found its way there. Gresford won (the match) 4-3 and meet Ragged School in the final. Could be an untidy affair. Chelsea and Arsenal fans may remember the Cup-Winners' Cup exploits of Real Zaragoza's Juan Esnaider in 1995.

Now she has allowed him to grow into adulthood, and the oddities of this horrifying changeling have an explanation. Barrel-chested, hirsute and a creature of instinct, not intellect, he is a genetic throwback, a noble neanderthal. Poor, uncomprehending Ben is abused by the author as well as her characters. Grunting his way through a series of highly improbable scenarios, he is bent clumsily to Lessing's enumeration of the ways in which homo sapiens has sinned against nature. The result is a crude fictionalised lecture on ethics. </p> <p> <strong> Ovid Metamorphosed</strong><br> ed Philip Terry<br> (Vintage, \u00a37.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000435249,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> With A S Byatt, Joyce Carol Oates and Margaret Atwood agreeing to contribute to the anthology, it is hard to imagine that Terry had trouble finding a publisher for this score of stories inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses . So few everyday readers know the original, but they can always refer to Ted Hughes's bestselling Tales From Ovid . The brief here provides a well-defined space for everyone to stretch, change or redefine the original. Sure, some contrivances work better than others, and there are more monsters from the subconscious than beautiful spirits of the imagination, but this is a clever conception that is both cerebral and enjoyable. </p> <p> <strong> American by Blood</strong><br>Andrew Huebner<br> (Black Swan, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000514677,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> The story of how the west was won has been told as victor's history and guilty tragedy, but Huebner's account is rather more messy. His starting point is the true story of how his great-great-grandfather, August Huebner, turned up late for Custer's last stand. Huebner sends his ancestor off as a scout, first to report back on Little Bighorn, then to hunt down the Cheyenne and Sioux armies. Until he mans a Gatling gun against an Indian encampment, Huebner's anger at the rout of the white man is subdued, whereas his two companions alternate between apocalyptic despair and murderous violence.

      "bodyText": "Ben, in the World Doris Lessing (Flamingo, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL Lessing first introduced us to Ben as \"The Fifth Child\", a destructive antithesis of infant innocence who tore the Lovatt family apart. Now she has allowed him to grow into adulthood, and the oddities of this horrifying changeling have an explanation. Barrel-chested, hirsute and a creature of instinct, not intellect, he is a genetic throwback, a noble neanderthal. Poor, uncomprehending Ben is abused by the author as well as her characters. Grunting his way through a series of highly improbable scenarios, he is bent clumsily to Lessing's enumeration of the ways in which homo sapiens has sinned against nature. The result is a crude fictionalised lecture on ethics. Ovid Metamorphosed ed Philip Terry (Vintage, \u00a37.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL With A S Byatt, Joyce Carol Oates and Margaret Atwood agreeing to contribute to the anthology, it is hard to imagine that Terry had trouble finding a publisher for this score of stories inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses . So few everyday readers know the original, but they can always refer to Ted Hughes's bestselling Tales From Ovid . The brief here provides a well-defined space for everyone to stretch, change or redefine the original. Sure, some contrivances work better than others, and there are more monsters from the subconscious than beautiful spirits of the imagination, but this is a clever conception that is both cerebral and enjoyable. American by Blood Andrew Huebner (Black Swan, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL The story of how the west was won has been told as victor's history and guilty tragedy, but Huebner's account is rather more messy. His starting point is the true story of how his great-great-grandfather, August Huebner, turned up late for Custer's last stand. Huebner sends his ancestor off as a scout, first to report back on Little Bighorn, then to hunt down the Cheyenne and Sioux armies. Until he mans a Gatling gun against an Indian encampment, Huebner's anger at the rout of the white man is subdued, whereas his two companions alternate between apocalyptic despair and murderous violence. Sparse and graphic, Huebner's is a very impressive debut. The Chase Lorna Fergusson (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL France, in fiction as in life, offers the English a bolt-hole from reality. But reality is inescapable, and so Fergusson makes Gerald and Netty pack their skeletons when they move to Le Sanglier, a hunting lodge in the Dordogne.

Other mediums (or should that be media?) did it too, but Mrs Duncan produced buckets of the stuff, from all orifices (yes, all). Sceptics suspected that she must simply be pulling out tightly packed yards of diaphanous material previously secreted in vaginal, rectal or nasal cavities. The fact that the alleged ectoplasm often emerged damp, soggy and horribly smelly apparently added weight to this theory, as well as a whole new level of meaning to the phrase \"Here's one I made earlier\". </p> <p>But, despite the fact that he devotes pages to its description, it is not mere love of ectoplasm that drives Malcolm Gaskill's \"biography of sorts\". Duncan is on the historians' map because, in 1944, she was tried at the Old Bailey under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in jail. This was more than unusual. Media (I can't resist) usually got off with a light fine for scaring the horses. </p> <p>So why was MI5 so worried about her? It seems that ectoplasm wasn't the only thing that flowed from Mrs Duncan: so did information. Somehow she was able to tell relatives about the sinking of a Portsmouth ship before the Admiralty confirmed it. And is it really so weird to hear that MI5 was fretting over a big fat lady with a fanny full of chiffon? Gaskill aptly reminds us that the War Office actually employed an astrologer to cast Hitler's horoscope (Aries: a bad month to invade Poland, enjoy withdrawing from Stalingrad). </p> <p>Yet why, when its social context is so unnerving, its gynaecological detail so thorough, is Gaskill's book so dull? The first clue lurks in his careful preface, where he goes to great pains to state what the book is not about - now that's what I call hitting the ground running. Apparently it is not an attempt to explain or justify Duncan's art or to talk about witchcraft. He's more interested, he says, in the \"cluster of ideas and values\" that surrounded these practices. He has, he insists, done his best to \"vanish\" in the presence of his subjects. </p> <p>Point taken, but he has vanished a tad too determinedly. Of course, to some extent his cautiousness about the whole malarkey is understandable - we need books that don't come down on either side of the supernatural debate. But on the other hand, this is such downright weird material. When Duncan's husband goes into a trance one night in bed and travels 64 miles to call on his sister (who happily confirms the visit), you do need to know where Gaskill stands. Trance or hangover? Diaphanous manifestation or Awayday Supersaver? Equally, when dead ectoplasmic flappers and babes come trooping out of Helen's nostrils like something from an Esther Williams finale, it's a bit much to expect us to read on without asking the obvious question. So Houdini-ishly has the author disappeared from his narrative that he has left us with something as amorphous and slippery as the outpourings from Duncan's own front bottom. </p> <p>It's a shame because, embedded in all this rambling, inconclusive prose is a sharp, acrid sense of how and why spiritualism took off after the Great War. So many dead, so many bereaved, such crowds queuing noisily on the Other Side. It is not that I doubt for a moment Gaskill's grip on his subject, more that I lament his inability to communicate it. I almost wept at his verbal knitting, his ostentatious wordiness. Whether you're a Cambridge don or a Huntingdon taxi driver, it's no good knowing lots of long words if you can't use them to bring your meaning alive. So I leave you with this 62-worder about Houdini: \"A passion for debunking was fuelled by failure to contact his beloved mother, disappointment which peaked in Atlantic City in June 1922 when the entranced wife of his friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle acted as amanuensis for a letter from a spirit which used the correct idiom but the wrong language: English rather than an inimitable mishmash of Hungarian, German and Yiddish.\" If that isn't uncontrolled ectoplasm, what is?</p>",

And one wearies of poems where the poet is obliged to strangle an animal he has just run over in his car. </p> <p>But this is the business. From the start, you realise that you are in the presence of a sharp, subversive and observant intelligence, a writer with an ear for a story and the easy narrative manner of someone who - it comes as an instant relief to notice this - isn't going to bore you once. </p> <p>Now, the whole point of criticism is to explain why certain poems are good, but sometimes only quotation will do; and this is a very quotable book.

Secondly, notice the artfully concealed control of the metre; it looks like bog-standard chopped-up prose, but note the smile behind the words \"irregular strides\" which alludes to this very effect, and the almost corny poise with which the line steps over the crack of the break in \"avoiding / the cracks\" (the draw of breath you make at the words \"stopped / to draw breath\" is another masterly touch). And thirdly, relish the cheek with which both poet and poem boldly announce their own technique and mission, as if daring you to see the operation of the muscles beneath the face: \"keeping a weather eye open / for the humdrum but telling detail\". As a frank statement of intent, and coming where it does - at the beginning - it is as welcoming as a handshake. (That the whole episode itself may, of course, be invented, makes it all even funnier.) And you know what? The poem gets even better. I won't spoil it for you by saying what happens next. (Can you imagine saying that about any other contemporary poet?) </p> <p>Boyle's poems aren't all fun and games, though. There are moments of sinister import, murderous hints recalling, now I come to think of it, Eliot's Sweeney; a series of poems called, fascinatingly, \"Alibis\"; and, overall, a mind continually on the qui vive , not quite vexed but, as it were, considering it. The voice is quite beguiling: completely unpretentious yet still resonant and lyrical; linguistically precise and emotionally evasive, often at the same time. We like that.</p>",

(That the whole episode itself may, of course, be invented, makes it all even funnier.) And you know what? The poem gets even better. I won't spoil it for you by saying what happens next. (Can you imagine saying that about any other contemporary poet?) Boyle's poems aren't all fun and games, though. There are moments of sinister import, murderous hints recalling, now I come to think of it, Eliot's Sweeney; a series of poems called, fascinatingly, \"Alibis\"; and, overall, a mind continually on the qui vive , not quite vexed but, as it were, considering it. The voice is quite beguiling: completely unpretentious yet still resonant and lyrical; linguistically precise and emotionally evasive, often at the same time. We like that.",

Lurid visions described by skryver Kelley at a seance and recorded by Dee in his diaries are reported by Woolley as though both men actually saw the apparition. Dee writes that \"Suddenly, there seemed to come out of my Oratory a Spiritual Creature, like a pretty girl of seven or nine years of age, attired on her head with her hair rolled up before, and hanging down very long behind, with a gown of Sey changeable green and red, and with a train . . . And so I considered . . . the divers reports which Edward Kelley made to me of this pretty maiden.\" Here Woolley lets us believe Dee too saw (or thought he saw) her skipping about the room. In fact, as always, Kelley was the medium through whom Dee addressed the supposed spirit presence and who answered through Kelley's mouth. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Woolley's level-headed, meticulously researched and readable book does allow us to stand back from the jumble of evidence - rescued, as Woolley elegantly shows via his preface and epilogue, by several partisan 17th-century scholars and mystical sympathisers - to assess the historical figure afresh. What stands out is Dee's steady association with known intelligence-gatherers - spies - as he moved between England, the Low Countries, Poland and Bohemia in the 1580s and 1590s. Whatever else Dee was doing as he crisscrossed Europe, trying, with increasing desperation, to realise the material wealth to which he believed his arcane knowledge entitled him, it looks as though he was collecting and sending back to Protestant England sensitive information from Catholic territories wherever he stopped. </p> <p>Wealth, in the end, eluded him. In a final irony, it was the fraudulent Kelley who, for a time, lived the life of a lord under the patronage of Rudolph II in Prague.

Spanning 25 years in the lives of three friends growing up in the working-class neighbourhoods of Boston, it begins with a childhood incident that returns to haunt them when, as adults, one of their own children is brutally murdered. As all three struggle to confront their inner demons, the breathtaking plot races towards an inevitable and tragic conclusion. Lehane's deceptive art lies not just in the exemplary investigative thriller but in a moving portrait of flawed people caught in a web of pain, told in lyrical prose that brings damaged lives and rundown cities to vivid life without a hint of forced sentimentality. <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000450502,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> <strong> Robbers </strong> by Christopher Cook (No Exit Press, \u00a310) is a stunning American hard-boiled debut in the tradition of Elmore Leonard, James Crumley and Natural Born Killers . Two drifters pull into a Texas 7 Eleven to buy a pack of cigarettes and shoot a guy over a penny. In the spiral of violence that follows, the killers are joined by a beautician and race down a road to nowhere, with their Texas Ranger nemesis never far behind. A bullet-riddled odyssey of jaded rednecks in search of illusory redemption, this is a hell of a debut. <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000399952,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p>Irish journalist John Connolly brings his haunted lawman Charlie Parker back for a third all-inclusive holiday in hell in <strong> The Killing Kind </strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a312.99). Connolly is becoming the unrivalled master of Maine noir, as he takes the damaged Parker into a maelstrom of evil when the mass grave of a religious community that disappeared 40 years earlier is linked with a death in high places.

Every local police officer knows that McKeach and Cistaro are the most prolific and ruthless practitioners of extortion, fraud, assault and murder in Massachusetts. What no one knows is how to stop these Michelangelos of crime, who have avoided jail for 30 years.

      "bodyText": "After five impressive novels dissecting the fraught relationship between a couple of private eyes, Dennis Lehane establishes himself as one of the greats of crime writing with Mystic River (Bantam, \u00a39.99). Spanning 25 years in the lives of three friends growing up in the working-class neighbourhoods of Boston, it begins with a childhood incident that returns to haunt them when, as adults, one of their own children is brutally murdered. As all three struggle to confront their inner demons, the breathtaking plot races towards an inevitable and tragic conclusion. Lehane's deceptive art lies not just in the exemplary investigative thriller but in a moving portrait of flawed people caught in a web of pain, told in lyrical prose that brings damaged lives and rundown cities to vivid life without a hint of forced sentimentality. Buy it at a discount at BOL Robbers by Christopher Cook (No Exit Press, \u00a310) is a stunning American hard-boiled debut in the tradition of Elmore Leonard, James Crumley and Natural Born Killers . Two drifters pull into a Texas 7 Eleven to buy a pack of cigarettes and shoot a guy over a penny. In the spiral of violence that follows, the killers are joined by a beautician and race down a road to nowhere, with their Texas Ranger nemesis never far behind. A bullet-riddled odyssey of jaded rednecks in search of illusory redemption, this is a hell of a debut.

Connolly is becoming the unrivalled master of Maine noir, as he takes the damaged Parker into a maelstrom of evil when the mass grave of a religious community that disappeared 40 years earlier is linked with a death in high places. Menace has never been so seductive.

Every local police officer knows that McKeach and Cistaro are the most prolific and ruthless practitioners of extortion, fraud, assault and murder in Massachusetts. What no one knows is how to stop these Michelangelos of crime, who have avoided jail for 30 years.

Eaves traces Daniel's own teenage progression with wit and warmth, from the desperate early need to belong - his night vision switches on when he cruelly rebuffs Carey, the nerdy tagalong friend who is closer to him than he could want or guess - to the later secrets and ties of forbearance and attraction. The novel catches perfectly the cusp of maturity at which self-consciousness becomes self-awareness, spurned geek morphs into dignified individualist and Daniel can at last tell Gregory he wants him and receive the easy riposte, \"Not with the zits on my back, you don't\".

Debut author Carole Stone, on a mission to share the secrets of her social success in Networking: The Art of Making Friends, is in danger of being a little too frank. In her Diary for the New Statesman, she confides that she just can't resist rushing into every bookshop she sees to buy a copy of her precious baby, and \"doing all those naff things like ordering dozens of copies for myself\". They all do it, Carole, but the smart ones keep it to themselves. </p> <p>\u0095 Read on at your peril: we're all sick in the head here. The Anthony Powell Society, miffed at \"politically correct obituarists\" keen to cast their boy as a toff - the Guardian comes in for particular criticism for daring to mention silver spoons - has enlisted the services of a psychologist to fight back. \"The slightly hysterical response to Powell's death says more about some of his critics than it does of the author or his work,\" he sniffs. \"What we are witnessing is an attempt to denigrate a writer greatly admired by his peers for a bias that isn't even there. It is a textbook case of projection.\" In the interests of balance, the Loafer scurried to the obituary in question - and was surprised to find not only a lengthy elaboration of Powell's august career but a comparison with Proust. But perhaps that's just denial. </p> <p>\u0095 One person's \"inspired act of literary invention\" is another's \"blatant and wholesale theft\", apparently. Over in the States, Margaret Mitchell's estate has taken out a restraining order against Alice Randall, a one-time C&amp;W songwriter who has turned to novel-writing with the ominously familiar-sounding The Wind Done Gone. Told from the point of view of Cynara, ex-plantation slave and half-sister to Scarlett O'Hara, the book is, according to its author, \"an antidote\" to the white-centred world of Mitchell's classic. But Mitchell's descendants, who have previously authorised sequels - for a share of the royalties - don't quite see it that way. The courts, heaven help them, will judge. </p> <p>\u0095 Harry Potter continues to spin his magic, raising Bloomsbury's profits (published earlier this week) by 120% to \u00a35.8m. But which little souls were buying \u00a3150-\u00a3200 tranches of shares before the announcement? It's hardly likely to be giant institutional investors.

They all do it, Carole, but the smart ones keep it to themselves. \u0095 Read on at your peril: we're all sick in the head here. The Anthony Powell Society, miffed at \"politically correct obituarists\" keen to cast their boy as a toff - the Guardian comes in for particular criticism for daring to mention silver spoons - has enlisted the services of a psychologist to fight back. \"The slightly hysterical response to Powell's death says more about some of his critics than it does of the author or his work,\" he sniffs. \"What we are witnessing is an attempt to denigrate a writer greatly admired by his peers for a bias that isn't even there. It is a textbook case of projection.\" In the interests of balance, the Loafer scurried to the obituary in question - and was surprised to find not only a lengthy elaboration of Powell's august career but a comparison with Proust. But perhaps that's just denial. \u0095 One person's \"inspired act of literary invention\" is another's \"blatant and wholesale theft\", apparently. Over in the States, Margaret Mitchell's estate has taken out a restraining order against Alice Randall, a one-time C&amp;W songwriter who has turned to novel-writing with the ominously familiar-sounding The Wind Done Gone. Told from the point of view of Cynara, ex-plantation slave and half-sister to Scarlett O'Hara, the book is, according to its author, \"an antidote\" to the white-centred world of Mitchell's classic. But Mitchell's descendants, who have previously authorised sequels - for a share of the royalties - don't quite see it that way. The courts, heaven help them, will judge. \u0095 Harry Potter continues to spin his magic, raising Bloomsbury's profits (published earlier this week) by 120% to \u00a35.8m. But which little souls were buying \u00a3150-\u00a3200 tranches of shares before the announcement? It's hardly likely to be giant institutional investors. Maybe those on the inside were better informed than the rest of us.",

In Arthur, freed from poverty by increasingly skilled factory work and from deference by the quietude of peacetime, Sillitoe created a hero both articulate and cynical, hedonistic and hard-working, an angry joker who voted communist in the spirit of supporting the underdog, bucked against the \"capital G of government\" and toyed with raffling off the Houses of Parliament. </p> <p>But Seaton's most memorable exploits and rebellions were always sexual, and if his many fans dreamt of a future for him, it would surely have been a world away from the uxorious attentiveness we encounter in Birthday , which is billed as a long-overdue sequel to Saturday Night . \"One day you'll really cop it,\" an enraged husband told Arthur in that book. \"And you'll ask for it as well.\" Forty-odd years later, and Arthur is indeed copping it: his beloved second wife Avril is slowly dying of cancer, the son who grew up without him scorns his tales of \"how much you suffered as a kid, when you only had a donkey's foreskin between the seven of you for Sunday dinner\", and the Nottingham he knew as a boy has all but disappeared. </p> <p>If his home town has changed - its trams, collieries and ironmongers replaced by saunas, cellphone shops and halal grocers - then so too has Arthur. Now his appetites seem unswervingly domestic, redirected towards gargantuan meals and soothing, mundane routines. His bile is still there, its withering invective occasionally political - the \"fuckpigs\" Blair, Cook and Robertson \"yammering about Nato winning the war when they've never heard the whistle of a bomb\" - but more frequently personal, surfacing in grumbles about high-rise flats, social workers and the idle young who stalk the city pubs and whinge about the privations of the dole. </p> <p>Arthur's encroaching misery frames the novel as Avril edges closer towards death, but its focus shifts to his elder brother Brian, a successful TV sitcom writer absent from the pages of Saturday Night, and invoked here as the one who got away. The birthday of the title is that of Jenny, Brian's childhood sweetheart, whose life has been martyred away caring for a husband paralysed in an industrial accident. As the novel opens, Brian, Arthur and Avril are en route to her surprise 70th celebrations, providing Brian with ample opportunity for nostalgia-filled speculation about what might have been had the seductions of Highgate not claimed him. </p> <p>It is hard not to detect a note of personal ambivalence in Sillitoe's depiction of Brian's solitary life: the book-lined study and easy money, imported cigars and arty London dinner parties. We learn that he has contemplated life as a novelist, \"but every proud-arsed bullshitting bowler-hatted toffee-nosed publisher with his rolled umbrella, idly indulging in his parasitical occupation for a so-called gentleman, had turned lily-white thumbs down on everything he wrote\". Instead, he plies his patter for the liquid medium of television, comforting himself with infrequently realised dreams of taking to the open road and - like Arthur before him - randy imaginings that seem to latch on to almost every woman he encounters. </p> <p>If Sillitoe's message is that you can take the boy out of Nottingham but you can't take Nottingham out of the boy, then he conveys it strongly: Brian's London life is only sketchily drawn, and the insistent pull that sends him back up the motorway seen as altogether more understandable. Hand in hand with Avril's lingering, understated death goes Brian's halting resumption of his relationship with Jenny, fatally compromised by their tacit agreement that they are both in love with the past rather than one another. </p> <p>In keeping with the atmosphere of missed chances and terminal decline, Sillitoe's prose is slow and ruminative, painstakingly tracking the decreasing circles of memory. Where Saturday Night and Sunday Morning was primed to capture the chaotic energy of youth, Birthday embodies the slackening of age and its poignant mixture of acceptance and resistance. Naturally, this results in a narrative far less charged and chancy than its predecessor, its small-scale tragedies unfolding without great show or overt passion. But in its depiction of brotherly love, it achieves much that is touching and unexpected. In youth, Arthur's constant refrain was a variation on the saying \"It's a great life if you don't weaken\"; Birthday shows us that weakening is inevitable, but not always fatal.</p>",

On the one hand, no piece of porn, however soft, is safe from the prying digits and silky skills of the Sapphic seducer; on the other, the tabloids pant lewdly after butch pieces who have boldly stolen wives and mothers. They say that the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two directly opposing points of view at the same time, in which case every man in the nearest pub is a genius, believing as he does that a) whenever two women have sex, they'd always secretly prefer it if a man was there and b) if your wife/girlfriend has sex with a woman she'll be ruined for ever, because only a woman knows what another woman really, really wants. And it's not crusty socks, beer breath and wind-breaking, for starters. </p> <p>Any old dyke will do when a man and his fist are looking for fun; imagine, then, finding out that a good number of the world's most beautiful women - Hollywood film stars - have always been at it like knives. Just as today, when the Popbitch website (<a href=\"http://www.popbitch.\">www.popbitch.com</a>) hums with rumours about modern dreamgirls such as Natalie Imbruglia and Cat Deeley, there is a particular sort of male sexual masochism that is unhealthily titillated by the idea of his love object being exquisitely repelled by him. This book should do him nicely. </p> <p>Diana McLellan is a \"reformed gossip columnist\" and a contributor to the Ladies Home Journal . In case you're thinking that the latter sounds a bit \"Bostonian\", the press release hilariously tells us rather more about her husband and her \"married daughter Fiona\" than we are used to on such occasions. As you might deduce from this, her style is racy and pacy, with little darts of starchiness. And her story is a sparkling, sad one. </p> <p>The golden age of Hollywood Saphhism ran for three decades - from the 1920s, with the influx of the decadent Europeans (the mainstays of the Sewing Circle, as it was archly known, were Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and the Spanish playgirl Mercedes de Acosta, the Warren Beatty of her day), to the 1950s, when the vicious snooping of the House Un-American Activities Committee (led, ironically, by the closeted gay lawyer Roy Cohn, who would die of Aids in the 1980s) crucified communists, liberals and the sexually flexible alike. </p> <p>McCarthy was not even searching out Anti-American activities, but Un-American ones; and what could be more the antithesis of American Mom than a smoky-voiced European Sapphic? (Though in her own sweet way, Dietrich was proud of her hausfrau streak, often greeting guests with her sleeves rolled up and her hair in a bandanna, having been suddenly overcome by a wild desire to scrub the kitchen floor.) The city Garbo described in 1926 as \"the one place in the world where you can live as you like and nobody will say anything about it, no matter what you do\" had become a snakepit of spite and neurotic conformity. </p> <p>This is not to say that the American girls didn't catch on quickly: Garbo ended up a prisoner of her ruined beauty, spending her days \"rousting the dead, brooding, making slipcovers and watching TV in bed\", when she wasn't dreaming of a remake of The Picture of Dorian Gray opposite Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn, we are told, \"rewarded herself\" with women to make up for all the joyless career sex she suffered with men. In the 1946 film The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, all three leading ladies - Barbara Stanwyck, Judith Anderson and Lizabeth Scott - were gay; a distaff version of Giant , where all three male leads, Rock Hudson, James Dean and Sal Mineo, were friends of Dorothy. At one point, it might have been easier to list the Hollywood squares who didn't dabble; gloriously, even the great costume designer Edith Head, whose cheeky name graces some 90% of Hollywood classics, indulged, sparking the inevitable quip: \"Edith Head gives good wardrobe.\" </p> <p>In the 1940s, a sexy young star like Lizabeth Scott - half Lauren Bacall, half Veronica Lake, but so much darker that her nickname was \"The Threat\" - could happily reveal in interviews with fan magazines that she always wore male cologne and pyjamas. By the 1950s she was revealed as an habitu\u00e9e of top-flight brothels by the truly horrendous Confidential magazine, whose amazing habit it was to \"offer\" stories for \"buy-back\" to their victims, running them only if the required fee was not forthcoming. It was largely due to Confidential that the Sewing Circle eventually scattered, mostly to Europe and Latin America, often accompanied by the gay husbands with whom they had been set up by the sympathetic studios and with whom they enjoyed long and happy arrangements or \"twilight tandems\". </p> <p>Interestingly, some of the greatest persecutors of homosexuality in America were Freudian analysts, whose declaration that queerness was a sickness that could poison society was pounced upon by right-wing bigots as much-needed intellectual ballast. The American Psychiatric Association did not remove homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders until the 1970s, when McLellan imagines Garbo pacing the streets of Manhattan dressed as a man, tormented by the young female lovers openly holding hands. </p> <p>In theory, the story should end on an upswing, with the passionate attachments, clammy jealousies and rather rank-sounding \"ranch vacations\" of the golden age replaced by the twice-the-fun bisexuality of stars such as Drew Barrymore (\"Let's just say I like women sexually. I love a woman's body and I think a woman and a woman together are beautiful\"). A group called Lesbians in Film and Television is 1,000 strong. But the downside is that lesbianism is today almost excusively used to titillate men - and, to keep it non-threatening, is purely about sex. </p> <p>In the past, lesbianism was about many things - mentoring, companionship, emotional sustenance. Now, for Hollywood at least, it's about looking good in a camisole. Women's declining power there (a creeping phenomenon since the 1950s, as if to punish them for the power they were slowly achieving in the real world) means that more than ever they are judged solely on their youth, beauty and appeal to men; being bisexual, as in the case of Barrymore, just makes them more interesting fantasies. Queen Victoria didn't understand how lesbians could have sex; present-day Hollywood doesn't understand how they can do anything but, preferably in glorious Technicolor. It's progress of a kind, I suppose - but not half as much seditious, transgressive fun.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To anyone interested in \"the writer's life\", Sean O'Brien's poetry already offers a number of glimpses of what it entails; \"Hours of carry-outs, hours of rain; / Hours of indolence mired in gloom - / I've tried and I've tried. I've even tried prose. / But the money's no good, and I don't like the room,\" he writes in the despairingly hilarious \"In Residency: A Worst Case Scenario\". </p> <p>Nor has anyone written better about the soul-destroying properties of libraries - or, indeed, librarians, like \"grim Miss McNair\", with her task \"to ensure, with her book-burner's glare, / That no one will add to what's already there\". He has also written chillingly on the belittling aspects of literary biography. So he is unsurprisingly laconic about his own life: \"I was born in London and grew up in Hull, and read English at the University of Cambridge. That's basically all that has ever happened to me as far as I can see. I spent some years as a schoolteacher in Sussex, teaching at a comprehensive school. But I've been writing full time really for about 12 years now. I don't think there's anything else to say.\" And then, simply, \"I live in Newcastle.\" </p> <p>But there is more to say, of course, and much of it stems from those geographical movements. A passionate northerner, O'Brien, whose latest volume of poetry, Downriver , is about to be published, writes a poetry of England - from its declining ports through its run-down railways, in (and, muckily, under) its towns, and winding through its Platonic suburbs - that reclaims Larkinland but with the informed political vision that its founder so lacked. O'Brien was first published in the 1980s, during the fiercest years of Thatcherism, although he had been writing since the mid-1960s, when he was 14. As with so many writers, the stimulus was \"a good English teacher, Mr Grayson, who used to put interesting work in front of us - Eliot, Ted Hughes, and others - and Macbeth , which I thought was the most interesting thing I'd ever seen, so I wanted to have a go at it\". </p> <p>But the mature writing came with his career as a teacher, when he moved to live on the Kent-Sussex border in 1980-81: \"It was the high period of Thatcherism and the social contrasts between south and north were very marked, not just economically but at the level of attitude. It introduced a kind of political education into the poems; that and the miner's strike . . . I had a feeling that poetry ought to be able to deal with political subjects. There's still a suspicion in English poetry that you defile yourself as with pitch if you go near politics. I don't think that has to be the case; politics is just as susceptible to the verbal imagination as any subject.\" </p> <p>O'Brien's poetry of the 1980s - in The Frighteners and HMS Glasshouse - uses formal and stylistic devices to evoke the divides and disappointments of the period, from the traditional ballad (scathing, satirical, direct) to a subtle wavering between detailed realism and dark surrealism. He also makes poetry of the terrain of his childhood: his 1950s upbringing, and the world war that preceded it. \"We felt the influence that there'd been a war very strongly just in the conduct of everyday life - rationing, National Service, a general sense of sobriety and restraint. Some supposedly radical critics see any attempt to examine the past as a kind of soft nostalgia - which I think is to misinterpret what poets are doing, which is to note points where other possibilities might have come into play.\" By Ghost Train , written during and after the 1992 election, O'Brien seems to have drawn a line between the political promise of the post-war contract and the bleakness of Thatcherite and Majorite Britain. Despite its humour - and O'Brien is one of the funniest, laugh-out-loud poets writing - it was a despairing volume. </p> <p>O'Brien believes that the current wisdom, that what is popular must therefore be good, is \"a self-denying ordinance about being able to read serious literature; which is really depressing, because when something good is put in front of people, they do find it interesting.\" O'Brien tackles this situation on a number of fronts; he is a critic for the Sunday Times and the Times Literary Supplement (\"an excellent critic\", says one of his editors); he edits a political and literary magazine, The Devil ; he teaches creative writing at Sheffield Hallam University; and now, in a sense, he is taking his argument to the country. </p> <p>The Poetry Book Society has organized a tour, named \"A Fine Excess\", kicking off in May, in which O'Brien and fellow poet Michael Donaghy will not only read their own work, but discuss themes in poetry and read poems by other writers. \"The idea is to talk about serious topics in a way that doesn't require the audience to be experts but doesn't assume them to be idiots either. The general reader and listener should find it good fun.\" Will there be T-shirts? O'Brien, a humorous and genial man, guffaws. \"Yeah, we're having one made saying No Sleep Till Basingstoke . . .\" </p> <p>He has also moved into drama: a verse play about politics called Laughter When We're Dead led on to other projects, including Downriver , a musical-theatre work, with the jazz composer Keith Morris; it ran at the Playhouse in Newcastle, and they are now working on a full-length version. That early delight in Macbeth has come full circle. O'Brien points out that the form is enjoying a small renaissance - Tony Harrison, Simon Armitage, Glyn Maxwell, and others have all written verse dramas in the past 10 years. \"I think its a good opportunity,\" he says: and then, perhaps remembering the hours of carry-outs and rain, \"Well, it gets you out of the house, for one thing.\"</p>",

Up to \u00a33,000 can be put in a cash Isa or \u00a37,000 in a shares Isa completely free of income and capital gains tax. But hurry; you only have until Thursday at midnight - the end of the 2000/01 tax year - or you will lose the tax benefit for ever. </p> <p>Amid recent stock market turmoil, most people are opting for cash Isas this year; Halifax says that the number of people opening cash Isas at its branches is averaging 80,000 per month, an increase of around 20% on the same period last year. Meanwhile, sales of more risky share Isas are down by 30%-40% on last year. </p> <p>However, Halifax's general manager (savings) Paul Duffin says: \"There is no doubt that the recent stock market volatility has encouraged many last-minute investors to opt for cash Isas. </p> <p>\"We have argued continuously that the right investment approach is 'cash first, equities later' for the majority of private investors.\" </p> <p>Your choice of cash Isa should depend purely on the interest rate offered and your confidence that the bank will keep rates competitive. The big banks are currently offering rates of around 5.5% to 6%, but shopping around will enable you to pick up a rate of up to 6.5%. </p> <p>Check the best buy tables in Jobs &amp; Money or log on to <a href=\"http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk\">www.moneyfacts.co.uk</a> for the current best Isa rates. </p> <p>As important as this over the next few days will be whether you will be able to open an account in time. All that is needed to open an account is two suitable forms of identification, such as a passport or a UK driving licence, plus something which gives proof of address, such as a utility bill, credit card or bank statement. </p> <p>Abbey National and Halifax, the two biggest cash Isa sellers, will not be making any special arrangements to keep branches open later this week, and will be observing their usual 5pm closing time. But shoppers at Safeway supermarkets where there are in-store Abbey National branches can open an account in most cases until 8pm on Thursday. </p> <p>Alliance &amp; Leicester is going a step further with its 6.15% cash Isa account. It is keeping six branches open until midnight on Thursday to accept Isa applications and all this week it will be keeping 80 branches open until 8pm. </p> <p>Not to be outdone, the sellers of share Isas are also taking exceptional measures to avoid a slump in sales. For example, brokers Killik &amp; Co says that it is keeping its London Piccadilly branch open until 9pm on the last two days of the tax year, with independent advisers at hand to help you choose which is the best Isa for you. </p> <p>Because of money laundering rules, investors need to be able to prove their identity and address, and should have their national insurance number with them. </p> <p>Killik partner Sasha Ewart says: \"Current market conditions are making many people nervous and whilst they understand the merit of an Isa they are unsure about their investment decisions. With the option of holding cash for a while, no one should miss out on their chance of a tax-free \u00a37,000 investment.\" </p> <p>Eight of the biggest share Isa sellers, including Henderson and Jupiter, are allowing investors to drop off last-minute applications at hotel collection points around the UK including Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow. Most are also keeping their London offices open until 11.55pm on Thursday. </p> <p>ABN Amro is opening an Isa cafe on Thursday night where investors will be able to choose a fund until 8pm. </p> <p>But for most last-minute investors the best option - and one of the cheapest - is to go on to the internet. </p> <p>One of the best sites is <a href=\"http://www.fundsnetwork.co.uk\">www.fundsnetwork.co.uk</a>, which gives investors access to 32 fund management groups and hundreds of funds. The site is operated by Fidelity Investments but runs like a supermarket, with both branded and own-brand Isas. </p> <p>Before buying a share Isa, take time to check out its performance statistics. Most managers will be able to find one period of performance where their fund shines, but for a fuller picture go to <a href=\"http://www.funds-sp.com \">www.funds-sp.com</a>. </p> <p>This website, operated by Standard &amp; Poor's, gives you free access to a remarkable amount of data on past performance of all unit and investment trusts. It also gives a star rating of funds, from one to five stars, plus an independent review of the biggest trusts supplied by Fund Research. Fund Research, which awards trusts a rating from single-A to its top triple-A grade, is used by a large number of financial advisers as the basis of their recommendations. </p> <p>One tip; don't pay the 3% to 5% initial fee that many funds charge. The money is paid directly on to financial advisers, and can be easily avoided. Funds network will discount the charge back to between 2% and 0%. Remember also that your \u00a37,000 Isa is not limited to just shares; it can be invested in lower risk corporate bonds, or, as reported below, even in commercial property. </p> <p>Anthony Yadgaroff of brokers Allenbridge says: \"People are understandably nervous about what to buy at the moment. For those looking for minimum risk, I suggest that they put their money into a corporate bond fund, which can be transferred once the market settles down.\" </p> <p>He recommends the bond funds offered by Norwich Union and Threadneedle Investments, and the gilt bond offered by Dresdner. </p> <p>But even if you are applying on the internet, don't leave it until the very last minute; 11.30pm on Thursday is when most net providers will accept applications. </p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian guide to Isas, sponsored by the David Aaron Partnership, is available free of charge by calling 0870-909-0264.</p>",

All that is needed to open an account is two suitable forms of identification, such as a passport or a UK driving licence, plus something which gives proof of address, such as a utility bill, credit card or bank statement. Abbey National and Halifax, the two biggest cash Isa sellers, will not be making any special arrangements to keep branches open later this week, and will be observing their usual 5pm closing time. But shoppers at Safeway supermarkets where there are in-store Abbey National branches can open an account in most cases until 8pm on Thursday. Alliance &amp; Leicester is going a step further with its 6.15% cash Isa account. It is keeping six branches open until midnight on Thursday to accept Isa applications and all this week it will be keeping 80 branches open until 8pm. Not to be outdone, the sellers of share Isas are also taking exceptional measures to avoid a slump in sales. For example, brokers Killik &amp; Co says that it is keeping its London Piccadilly branch open until 9pm on the last two days of the tax year, with independent advisers at hand to help you choose which is the best Isa for you. Because of money laundering rules, investors need to be able to prove their identity and address, and should have their national insurance number with them. Killik partner Sasha Ewart says: \"Current market conditions are making many people nervous and whilst they understand the merit of an Isa they are unsure about their investment decisions. With the option of holding cash for a while, no one should miss out on their chance of a tax-free \u00a37,000 investment.\" Eight of the biggest share Isa sellers, including Henderson and Jupiter, are allowing investors to drop off last-minute applications at hotel collection points around the UK including Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow. Most are also keeping their London offices open until 11.55pm on Thursday. ABN Amro is opening an Isa cafe on Thursday night where investors will be able to choose a fund until 8pm. But for most last-minute investors the best option - and one of the cheapest - is to go on to the internet. One of the best sites is www.fundsnetwork.co.uk, which gives investors access to 32 fund management groups and hundreds of funds. The site is operated by Fidelity Investments but runs like a supermarket, with both branded and own-brand Isas. Before buying a share Isa, take time to check out its performance statistics. Most managers will be able to find one period of performance where their fund shines, but for a fuller picture go to www.funds-sp.com. This website, operated by Standard &amp; Poor's, gives you free access to a remarkable amount of data on past performance of all unit and investment trusts. It also gives a star rating of funds, from one to five stars, plus an independent review of the biggest trusts supplied by Fund Research. Fund Research, which awards trusts a rating from single-A to its top triple-A grade, is used by a large number of financial advisers as the basis of their recommendations. One tip; don't pay the 3% to 5% initial fee that many funds charge. The money is paid directly on to financial advisers, and can be easily avoided. Funds network will discount the charge back to between 2% and 0%. Remember also that your \u00a37,000 Isa is not limited to just shares; it can be invested in lower risk corporate bonds, or, as reported below, even in commercial property. Anthony Yadgaroff of brokers Allenbridge says: \"People are understandably nervous about what to buy at the moment. For those looking for minimum risk, I suggest that they put their money into a corporate bond fund, which can be transferred once the market settles down.\" He recommends the bond funds offered by Norwich Union and Threadneedle Investments, and the gilt bond offered by Dresdner. But even if you are applying on the internet, don't leave it until the very last minute; 11.30pm on Thursday is when most net providers will accept applications. \u0095 The Guardian guide to Isas, sponsored by the David Aaron Partnership, is available free of charge by calling 0870-909-0264.",

He turned down calls to reform the current regime which requires everyone with a personal pension or who belongs to a money purchase company scheme to use most of their pension savings to buy an annuity (which gives them an income for the rest of their life) by the age of 75. </p> <p>Mr Portillo says that if his party is elected, it will change the system so that people are only required to buy an annuity large enough to keep them above the state support threshold, leaving them free to use the rest of their money in other ways. </p> <p>However, you wouldn't be completely free to do whatever you want with this money - the Tories would put in place a \"simple retirement account mechanism\" within which the individual can choose their own investment strategy \"within prescribed guidelines\". </p> <p>Crucially, any capital remaining on the death of the retiree and their spouse will pass to the individual's estate, subject to a 35% tax charge. </p> <p>Mr Portillo says he wants to \"put more trust in people\" to enable them to keep more of their gains, and adds: \"Buying an annuity at the moment represents very poor value for the person concerned.\" </p> <p>He also wants to revamp the \"individual pension account\" (Ipa), which was unveiled by the government last summer and is supposed to allow people to put their pension money into collective investments such as unit trusts. </p> <p>Ipas will work in a similar way to Isas, operating as a tax-efficient container for collective investments, and will be available from next week to stakeholder pensions, personal pensions and money purchase occupational schemes. </p> <p>The Tories would remove the requirement to invest in an Ipa through a pension scheme, but would retain the tax rules applying to pension saving and may allow people to have limited access to their accounts - for example, in cases of \"acute healthcare need\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives said this week that if they win the general election they would scrap the rules that force people to use most of their pension fund to buy an annuity when they retire. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, also said his party would revamp the pension rules so that in certain limited situations such as very poor health, people could access the cash in their pension pots. The Conservatives are seeking to exploit what was generally regarded as a pre-election Budget that offered little of benefit to savers and investors. While Gordon Brown rejected calls to cut or abolish the 0.5% stamp duty on share purchases, Mr Portillo pledged that he would review the duty. The Chancellor left many older people incensed by his lack of action on annuities. He turned down calls to reform the current regime which requires everyone with a personal pension or who belongs to a money purchase company scheme to use most of their pension savings to buy an annuity (which gives them an income for the rest of their life) by the age of 75. Mr Portillo says that if his party is elected, it will change the system so that people are only required to buy an annuity large enough to keep them above the state support threshold, leaving them free to use the rest of their money in other ways. However, you wouldn't be completely free to do whatever you want with this money - the Tories would put in place a \"simple retirement account mechanism\" within which the individual can choose their own investment strategy \"within prescribed guidelines\". Crucially, any capital remaining on the death of the retiree and their spouse will pass to the individual's estate, subject to a 35% tax charge. Mr Portillo says he wants to \"put more trust in people\" to enable them to keep more of their gains, and adds: \"Buying an annuity at the moment represents very poor value for the person concerned.\" He also wants to revamp the \"individual pension account\" (Ipa), which was unveiled by the government last summer and is supposed to allow people to put their pension money into collective investments such as unit trusts. Ipas will work in a similar way to Isas, operating as a tax-efficient container for collective investments, and will be available from next week to stakeholder pensions, personal pensions and money purchase occupational schemes. The Tories would remove the requirement to invest in an Ipa through a pension scheme, but would retain the tax rules applying to pension saving and may allow people to have limited access to their accounts - for example, in cases of \"acute healthcare need\".",

      "body": "<p>The way millions of people save for the future is about to undergo a major transformation. On Friday a new type of private pension plan - the stakeholder pension - will go on sale for the first time. Over the coming months the government and pension firms will be bombarding us with ads designed to hammer home the message that saving for your retirement is one of the most important things you'll ever do. </p> <p>In the light of a new survey that has found that nearly a third of adults have made no pension provision at all, ministers are determined to get us to put aside more money for our old age. </p> <p>They have come up with stakeholder pensions, which have been described as a much more user-friendly version of personal pensions. They will be offered by all the companies that offer pensions now, plus probably quite a few others. The government promises they will be simple to understand, good value and flexible. And they will be open to everyone, not just those in work. </p> <p>The big carrot being dangled in front of us is \"free money\". Everyone, even non-taxpayers, will get at least basic-rate tax relief on their pension payments. That means that for every \u00a3100 a typical individual contributes to a stakeholder, the government will cough up an extra \u00a328 into your fund. </p> <p>The main downside is that you cannot withdraw any money before you take your pension, and you can't do that until you are at least 50. Also, like personal pensions, stakeholder pensions will be money purchase schemes - when you retire you must use most of your pension fund to buy an annuity, which then gives you an income for life. </p> <p>Even if they don't prove as big a hit as the government would like, stakeholders have already succeeded in sweeping away the old regime of high-charging, inflexible pension plans. In the past, taking out a personal pension could well have meant being stung by an initial charge of 5%-7%, an annual charge of perhaps 2% and maybe extra fees such as a \u00a32 a month policy charge. With a stakeholder, the most a company will be able to charge for managing your money is an all-in 1% a year. </p> <p>Here we look to see whether a stakeholder pension will benefit you. </p> <p> <strong> Your company doesn't offer a pension scheme</strong> </p> <p> Millions of people in this position will be winners because under the new rules all businesses employing five or more people which do not already have a pension scheme in place will have to offer staff access to a stakeholder scheme. That means the boss will have to select a scheme for workers to pay into and will also have to arrange for people's pension contributions to be deducted directly from their earnings if that's what staff request. The government has warned that if businesses don't comply with these rules they could face a fine of up to \u00a350,000. </p> <p>The more decent employers will not only set up a stakeholder scheme but will also make a regular contribution to your plan. Some may offer to match your contributions, so if you contribute 3% of your salary they will put in 3% too, says insurer Legal &amp; General. </p> <p>However, you're a stakeholder loser if you work for a company employing fewer than five staff because the government has exempted them from the requirement of having to give workers access to a stakeholder scheme. People who work for these companies will still be able to buy a stakeholder pension direct from a provider but the suspicion is that, faced with sorting it out themselves, many of these people are likely to simply do nothing. </p> <p>There was some hope for people working for very small firms this week - a survey showed that 22% of them are planning to do the decent thing and offer their staff access to a stakeholder scheme, even though they are not obliged to do this. </p> <p> <strong> You already belong to a company scheme</strong> </p> <p> If you belong to your employer's company pension scheme, you should stick with it as this will almost certainly be the best way of saving for your retirement. </p> <p>That's because most employers will contribute to the scheme on your behalf or will provide extra benefits such as free life insurance. </p> <p>If there is a company pension scheme where you work and you haven't joined it, check it out before doing anything as again this will probably be the best place to be. </p> <p>Meanwhile many workers will have already amassed a motley collection of personal and company pensions. Anyone who moves job often freezes their old pension and starts paying into a new one. The arrival of stakeholder begs the question: should all previous pensions be moved into a low-charging stakeholder alternative? </p> <p>The answer is: possibly. First you must check on the transfer charges that will be imposed by your current pension providers. Many providers that pass on high management and admin charges to pension scheme members will also be the kind of nasty pension provider that slaps huge transfer penalties on anyone who dares switch. It still might be worth it if you are young and the low-charging stakeholder has time to make up the difference. </p> <p> <strong> You are excluded from taking out a pension</strong> </p> <p> Stakeholder pensions are genuinely innovative because they will be available to millions of people who have up until now been barred from taking out a pension. These people include carers, mature students and those taking career breaks as well as those who have recently been made redundant or who have got divorced and may have a lump sum available to put into a pension. People who work only periodically will for the first time be able to use savings or other money to continue to make contributions during the times they are not working. This also applies to women who are taking time out of the workplace to raise a family. </p> <p>Another group of winners are children. Any non-taxpayer can benefit from them, including youngsters. Chartered accountants Hacker Young say stakeholder pensions will give parents or grandparents a great way to take care of their child's future financial security. Paying in \u00a350 a month from the birth of a child until he or she hits 18 would produce a fund worth an estimated \u00a3256,000 by the time the child reaches 60, says Legal &amp; General. </p> <p>Parents who can afford it may wish to redirect child benefit into a stakeholder for their son or daughter. If a parent decides to invest the \u00a315.50 a week child benefit currently paid by the state, once the tax relief is added this means \u00a386 a month will go into their pension, says pension consultants Alexander Forbes. </p> <p>But the benefits of stakeholder could be slim for savers who are only able to put away small sums each month. </p> <p>According to figures from the main City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, a single 30-year-old who starts saving \u00a320 a month into a pension will receive a monthly payment of \u00a398 when they retire at 65. This figure can be added to the state pension, which is likely to continue rising in line with inflation after this year's boost.</p> <p>At the moment, income from savings or investments are deducted from benefits after retirement on a pound for pound basis. Next year, for instance, pensioners are entitled to the state pension of \u00a372.50 a week and top-up income support payments up to the level \u00a392.15, called the minimum income guarantee.</p> <p>So pensioners will find that benefits will be deducted from extra income up to \u00a319.35 a week or \u00a385.15 a month, which wipes out almost all of the \u00a38,400 saved up over 35 years by our hypothetical saver.</p> <p>To overcome this problem the government has invented the pension credit. The credit will operate from 2003 and will effectively deduct 40p from benefits for every pound of extra income. That means for every \u00a31 you save you keep 60p until the benefit runs out. Critics argue it is a complicated answer to the problem, but ministers believe it is fair.</p> <p>Whatever the answer, the pension credit will be increasingly important. While the state pension rises with inflation, the minimum income guarantee is set to rise with earnings and will become a significant element of pensioner income in future years.</p> <p><strong>You are self-employed </strong></p> <p>Self-employed workers already know that governments, whatever their political colour, expect them to look after number one. State benefits, no matter how much national insurance they pay, are not for them.</p> <p>Yet while personal pensions with stakeholder rules will be a boon for most, not all self-employed people should jump aboard.</p> <p>More affluent workers who stash away large sums in their pension funds can negotiate big cuts in their charges below the government's 1% ceiling. If they are automatically switched to a stakeholder pension they should check their charges have not actually increased.</p> <p>Old \"226\" contracts taken out before June 1988 will also be jealously guarded by the affluent. While the 226 contracts restrict the percentage of income they can put into their pension each year according to age, that is the only cap.</p> <p>They escape the cap on tax relief for people who earn more than \u00a391,800 (\u00a395,400 next year). It means they can pour in as much money from their gross income as they like into their pension, restricted only by the age-related per centage. Anyone else should tell their insurer they want to switch. Standard Life and several other life companies are switching members automatically, while others such as Legal &amp; General are not.</p> <p><strong>You are well-off </strong></p> <p>Stakeholder pensions represent a fantastic tax perk for the rich. It's not the government's aim at all, but the new scheme will allow the well-off to benefit in a variety of ways.</p> <p>For example, a highly paid boss with a wife who doesn't work and who already puts the maximum amount into his pension can now shovel a further \u00a33,600 a year into a stakeholder pension in his wife's name, and benefit from tax relief on the contributions. Over 20 years that means he's been able to tuck away \u00a372,000 - \u00a315,840 of which will have come out of the government's coffers.</p> <p>Likewise, stakeholder pensions represent a great inheritance tax dodge for rich parents and grandparents. They will be able to get an immediate tax benefit by making regular payments into a stakeholder plan on behalf of children or grandchildren. The payments will be regarded as \"regular gifts out of income\" so they will not be liable for inheritance tax. And, of course, the donor is receiving tax relief on the payments.</p>",

Your company doesn't offer a pension scheme Millions of people in this position will be winners because under the new rules all businesses employing five or more people which do not already have a pension scheme in place will have to offer staff access to a stakeholder scheme. That means the boss will have to select a scheme for workers to pay into and will also have to arrange for people's pension contributions to be deducted directly from their earnings if that's what staff request. The government has warned that if businesses don't comply with these rules they could face a fine of up to \u00a350,000. The more decent employers will not only set up a stakeholder scheme but will also make a regular contribution to your plan. Some may offer to match your contributions, so if you contribute 3% of your salary they will put in 3% too, says insurer Legal &amp; General. However, you're a stakeholder loser if you work for a company employing fewer than five staff because the government has exempted them from the requirement of having to give workers access to a stakeholder scheme. People who work for these companies will still be able to buy a stakeholder pension direct from a provider but the suspicion is that, faced with sorting it out themselves, many of these people are likely to simply do nothing. There was some hope for people working for very small firms this week - a survey showed that 22% of them are planning to do the decent thing and offer their staff access to a stakeholder scheme, even though they are not obliged to do this. You already belong to a company scheme If you belong to your employer's company pension scheme, you should stick with it as this will almost certainly be the best way of saving for your retirement. That's because most employers will contribute to the scheme on your behalf or will provide extra benefits such as free life insurance. If there is a company pension scheme where you work and you haven't joined it, check it out before doing anything as again this will probably be the best place to be. Meanwhile many workers will have already amassed a motley collection of personal and company pensions. Anyone who moves job often freezes their old pension and starts paying into a new one. The arrival of stakeholder begs the question: should all previous pensions be moved into a low-charging stakeholder alternative? The answer is: possibly. First you must check on the transfer charges that will be imposed by your current pension providers. Many providers that pass on high management and admin charges to pension scheme members will also be the kind of nasty pension provider that slaps huge transfer penalties on anyone who dares switch. It still might be worth it if you are young and the low-charging stakeholder has time to make up the difference. You are excluded from taking out a pension Stakeholder pensions are genuinely innovative because they will be available to millions of people who have up until now been barred from taking out a pension. These people include carers, mature students and those taking career breaks as well as those who have recently been made redundant or who have got divorced and may have a lump sum available to put into a pension. People who work only periodically will for the first time be able to use savings or other money to continue to make contributions during the times they are not working. This also applies to women who are taking time out of the workplace to raise a family. Another group of winners are children. Any non-taxpayer can benefit from them, including youngsters. Chartered accountants Hacker Young say stakeholder pensions will give parents or grandparents a great way to take care of their child's future financial security. Paying in \u00a350 a month from the birth of a child until he or she hits 18 would produce a fund worth an estimated \u00a3256,000 by the time the child reaches 60, says Legal &amp; General. Parents who can afford it may wish to redirect child benefit into a stakeholder for their son or daughter. If a parent decides to invest the \u00a315.50 a week child benefit currently paid by the state, once the tax relief is added this means \u00a386 a month will go into their pension, says pension consultants Alexander Forbes. But the benefits of stakeholder could be slim for savers who are only able to put away small sums each month. According to figures from the main City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, a single 30-year-old who starts saving \u00a320 a month into a pension will receive a monthly payment of \u00a398 when they retire at 65. This figure can be added to the state pension, which is likely to continue rising in line with inflation after this year's boost. At the moment, income from savings or investments are deducted from benefits after retirement on a pound for pound basis. Next year, for instance, pensioners are entitled to the state pension of \u00a372.50 a week and top-up income support payments up to the level \u00a392.15, called the minimum income guarantee. So pensioners will find that benefits will be deducted from extra income up to \u00a319.35 a week or \u00a385.15 a month, which wipes out almost all of the \u00a38,400 saved up over 35 years by our hypothetical saver. To overcome this problem the government has invented the pension credit. The credit will operate from 2003 and will effectively deduct 40p from benefits for every pound of extra income. That means for every \u00a31 you save you keep 60p until the benefit runs out. Critics argue it is a complicated answer to the problem, but ministers believe it is fair. Whatever the answer, the pension credit will be increasingly important. While the state pension rises with inflation, the minimum income guarantee is set to rise with earnings and will become a significant element of pensioner income in future years. You are self-employed Self-employed workers already know that governments, whatever their political colour, expect them to look after number one. State benefits, no matter how much national insurance they pay, are not for them. Yet while personal pensions with stakeholder rules will be a boon for most, not all self-employed people should jump aboard. More affluent workers who stash away large sums in their pension funds can negotiate big cuts in their charges below the government's 1% ceiling. If they are automatically switched to a stakeholder pension they should check their charges have not actually increased. Old \"226\" contracts taken out before June 1988 will also be jealously guarded by the affluent. While the 226 contracts restrict the percentage of income they can put into their pension each year according to age, that is the only cap. They escape the cap on tax relief for people who earn more than \u00a391,800 (\u00a395,400 next year). It means they can pour in as much money from their gross income as they like into their pension, restricted only by the age-related per centage. Anyone else should tell their insurer they want to switch. Standard Life and several other life companies are switching members automatically, while others such as Legal &amp; General are not. You are well-off Stakeholder pensions represent a fantastic tax perk for the rich. It's not the government's aim at all, but the new scheme will allow the well-off to benefit in a variety of ways. For example, a highly paid boss with a wife who doesn't work and who already puts the maximum amount into his pension can now shovel a further \u00a33,600 a year into a stakeholder pension in his wife's name, and benefit from tax relief on the contributions. Over 20 years that means he's been able to tuck away \u00a372,000 - \u00a315,840 of which will have come out of the government's coffers. Likewise, stakeholder pensions represent a great inheritance tax dodge for rich parents and grandparents. They will be able to get an immediate tax benefit by making regular payments into a stakeholder plan on behalf of children or grandchildren. The payments will be regarded as \"regular gifts out of income\" so they will not be liable for inheritance tax. And, of course, the donor is receiving tax relief on the payments.",

      "body": "<p>Turn the crash into cash. That is the rather crude slogan being used by AIG Life to promote its High Income Stockmarket Bond. But it highlights the fact that the fall in the markets is good news for the so-called \"guaranteed\" investment plans or bonds currently on offer. </p> <p>The promised returns look very tempting. Two of the plans, offered by GE Life and Scottish Widows, guarantee a fixed annual income of 10.25% gross over a three-year period, or capital growth of 33%. </p> <p>However, it is important to remember that, while the income or capital growth returns are genuinely guaranteed, the return of your original capital is dependent on the performance of stock market indices over the period. If the indices fail to meet the specified target, then you could lose a big slice of the capital invested - in effect using your own capital to provide the guaranteed returns. </p> <p>However, the lower the starting point, the better the chance of obtaining a full return of your original capital plus the high returns. </p> <p>For example, the GE Life Income &amp; Growth Plan IV, which runs for just over three years, offers a full return of capital unless the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks the share price performance of the biggest 50 publicly quoted companies in euroland, falls by more than 20% below the starting level at the beginning of the investment period in May. </p> <p>This safety margin looks a lot better after the recent shake-out in the European stock markets. </p> <p>Scottish Widows Extra Income and Growth Plan offers similar fixed income or capital growth returns.

The majority of investors tend not to use this exemption. </p> <p>The income options are subject to income tax.

      "bodyText": "Turn the crash into cash. That is the rather crude slogan being used by AIG Life to promote its High Income Stockmarket Bond. But it highlights the fact that the fall in the markets is good news for the so-called \"guaranteed\" investment plans or bonds currently on offer. The promised returns look very tempting. Two of the plans, offered by GE Life and Scottish Widows, guarantee a fixed annual income of 10.25% gross over a three-year period, or capital growth of 33%. However, it is important to remember that, while the income or capital growth returns are genuinely guaranteed, the return of your original capital is dependent on the performance of stock market indices over the period. If the indices fail to meet the specified target, then you could lose a big slice of the capital invested - in effect using your own capital to provide the guaranteed returns. However, the lower the starting point, the better the chance of obtaining a full return of your original capital plus the high returns. For example, the GE Life Income &amp; Growth Plan IV, which runs for just over three years, offers a full return of capital unless the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks the share price performance of the biggest 50 publicly quoted companies in euroland, falls by more than 20% below the starting level at the beginning of the investment period in May. This safety margin looks a lot better after the recent shake-out in the European stock markets. Scottish Widows Extra Income and Growth Plan offers similar fixed income or capital growth returns. But it is more complicated in that the return of original capital is linked to the performance of 30 individual shares currently included in the FTSE l00. The investment is split into 30 equal parts. There is a reduction in the return of original capital if the market price of any share falls by more than 33% below the starting level at any time during the investment period and fails to recover to its initial starting value by the maturity date. In that event the capital return will be reduced by 1/30th for each share that has fallen by more than 33% and remained below the starting price level, based on the value of the share at the maturity date. For example, if a share was to end 50% below the starting level, the return of original capital would be reduced by 50% of l/30th - ie 1.66%. If half the shares - ie l5 shares - were all to suffer price losses of 50% then the original capital would be cut by just under 25%. Once again the recent shake-out in share values means a lower starting point, making a further 33% more unlikely. In both cases investors have the choice of either taking the fixed annual income of 10.25% for three years or receive monthly income at a slightly lower rate of 0.78% (GE Life) or quarterly income of 2.50% (Scottish Widows). The capital growth option of 33% is not a particularly attractive compounded rate, but it has the advantage of being subject to capital gains tax, which is only payable if you have used up your full exemption in the tax year when the plans mature - ie 2004/2005. The majority of investors tend not to use this exemption. The income options are subject to income tax. But because the plans are based on the performance of specially created companies, quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange, they are subject to the special Schedule F income tax imposed on dividends of foreign companies at the lower rate of 10% for standard rate taxpayers and 32.5% for high-rate taxpayers. In addition the plans are eligible for inclusion in an Isa - subject to the maximum of \u00a37,000 - or for transfers from Peps or existing Isas, where there is no limit on the amount that can be invested. Unfortunately, the Pep/Isa transfer deadline for the Scottish Widows Extra Income &amp; Growth plan has already passed because the deadline for applications is April 4, and extra time is needed to process transfers. However, the GE Life High Income &amp; Growth Plan IV, which comes on to the market from April 2, is scheduled to close on May 11, if it is not oversubscribed before that date and the Pep/Isa deadline is April 27. Another \"guaranteed\" product currently available (until April 30) is the NDF Extra Bonus Plan 2, which offers a fixed return over a 13-month period of 10%, with a full return of capital if the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index does not fall by more than 25%. Alternatively, the return can be boosted to 12% if you are prepared to only receive a full return of capital if the Euro Stoxx index doesn't fall at all. In both cases there is only one payment on maturity and this will be subject to capital gains tax. It should be borne in mind that, in theory, the shorter the time period, the greater the risk, since the markets have less time to recover. The advantage, however, is that you don't have to lock your money away for very long. For those prepared to lock their money away for five and a half years, and not receive any income, the Inora Offshore Accumulator Growth Fund, series l, available until April 12, offers a guaranteed minimum return of 20% plus a maximum return of 110% dependent on the performance of the highly volatile Nasdaq index. The investment period is divided into 11 separate periods of six months each, with a maximum possible return of l0% for each period. The final return will be based on the average performance of the index over the 11 periods compared with the starting level. There is not much chance of achieving the maximum return of 110%, since the index would, therefore, have to rise consistently throughout the whole five and a half years. But there should be a very good chance of exceeding the minimum of 20%, assuming the index starts from a low level. Inora is a new offshore company, recently formed by the French-based Societe General group, so it should have more than adequate financial resources to meet any commitments. As an offshore bond, the return for UK investors will be subject to income tax at their highest marginal rate. However, it could be used for Sipp or Sass pension plans or as a long-term savings plan for children. Finally the Crash for Cash bond from AIG Life.

At present it offers a fixed annual return of 6.75%, net of standard rate tax, over a four-year investment period, with a full return of original capital if the FTSE l00 index is higher than the starting level on maturity in four years' time. With all these products, there are no extra charges since these have been taken into account when calculating the promised returns. There has been considerable criticism of \"guaranteed\" products over the past few years, since they came into vogue, on the grounds that many investors don't know what they are buying - and in particular that, while the fixed returns are guaranteed, there is a real risk of losing a large slice of original capital.

A flood of brokers' surveys this week urges investment in the sector, with targets set for much higher individual valuations for all of the largest banks.

      "byline": "Jill Papworth",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stakeholders are a new type of cheap and simple private pension plan with government-imposed maximum charges and minimum standards. </p> <p>They go on sale on April 6, with charges capped at 1% per year and no initial charges. You can make payments from just \u00a320 per month and stop, start and change them at will. You can take your stakeholder pension with you when you change jobs, and transfer between providers at no cost. </p> <p> <strong> Are they a better deal than traditional personal pensions?</strong> </p> <p> You bet. Personal pensions had initial charges of 5%-10% plus annual charges of 1%-3%, enough to pay big commissions to salespeople and big profits for providers. </p> <p> <strong> Should I take one out?</strong> </p> <p> Only if your employer does not already offer a company pension. </p> <p>Stakeholders are aimed at the 40% of workers who earn between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 a year but, perhaps because they are on contract or self-employed, or work in small companies, are not offered a company scheme. </p> <p> <strong> Do I have to be in work to take one out?</strong> </p> <p> No. One of the big innovations in stakeholder is that you can earn tax relief on the money you put in even if you are not working. This means that, for the first time, people without employment will be able to contribute to a pension or get someone else to contribute on their behalf and obtain basic-rate tax relief on the contributions. </p> <p> <strong> Why don't I buy an Isa or invest in property for my retirement instead?</strong> </p> <p> Because of the tax relief on stakeholder pensions. You can make payments of up to \u00a33,600 a year (\u00a3300 per month) into a stakeholder and earn full tax relief on all the money. </p> <p>This means the government is giving you a 22% or 40% bonus depending on your tax band. </p> <p> <strong> I already have a company pension. Should I switch?</strong> </p> <p> Almost certainly not. The contributions that an employer makes into your pension far outweigh any benefits that an individual stakeholder pension will give you. But you may be able to buy a stakeholder as well. The rules allow anyone in a company scheme earning less than \u00a330,000 a year to invest in a stakeholder too. And the \u00a33,600 allowance comes on top of the maximum 15% of salary you are allowed to contribute each year into an occupational scheme. </p> <p> <strong> I already have a personal pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder?</strong> </p> <p> As stakeholders are designed to be cheaper and more flexible than personal pensions, you should look into doing so. Your decision should rest on the size of exit penalty you might face and the length of time you have contributed to a personal pension. The longer you have saved, the less worthwhile it will be to switch. </p> <p> <strong> If my employer offers a stakeholder, should I take it?</strong> </p> <p> It depends on whether your employer is offering to pay any contributions into the plan. If they are, it will usually be a good idea to join this plan rather than go elsewhere. But do oppose any move by your employer to close down an existing company pension scheme and offer a stakeholder instead. </p> <p> <strong> Will I still get the state pension?</strong> </p> <p> Yes. The aim of stakeholder is to give a top-up pension to people on lower and middle incomes. </p> <p> <strong> Will I pay tax on the income from my stakeholder pension, and will it hit my benefits?</strong> </p> <p> Yes and yes. The income from your stakeholder will be treated like any other income (and any other pension) and will be taxable. </p> <p>A much thornier issue is the benefits problem. For poorer people, the income earned from the stakeholder pension may simply mean that other income, such as housing benefit, will be reduced pound-for-pound. </p> <p> <strong> Will all stakeholder pensions be the same?</strong> </p> <p> Not quite. The rules mean they all charge no more than 1% a year, but the final pension pot you receive will depend on how successful they are at investing your money. </p> <p>\u0095 A government-backed helpline run by the Pensions Advisory Service (Opas) on 084-601-2923 (<a href=\"http://www.stakeholderhelpline.org.uk\">www.stakeholderhelpline.org.uk</a>) offers free information on stakeholder pensions from 8.30am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday with calls charged at local rates. Impartial information on stakeholders is also available from the Financial Services Authority, the main watchdog, on its consumer helpline 0845-606-1234 or website <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer\">www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer.</a> Also online is the government's impartial pensions website at <a href=\"http://www.pensionguide.gov.uk\">www.pensionguide.gov.uk</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stakeholders are a new type of cheap and simple private pension plan with government-imposed maximum charges and minimum standards. They go on sale on April 6, with charges capped at 1% per year and no initial charges. You can make payments from just \u00a320 per month and stop, start and change them at will. You can take your stakeholder pension with you when you change jobs, and transfer between providers at no cost. Are they a better deal than traditional personal pensions? You bet. Personal pensions had initial charges of 5%-10% plus annual charges of 1%-3%, enough to pay big commissions to salespeople and big profits for providers. Should I take one out? Only if your employer does not already offer a company pension. Stakeholders are aimed at the 40% of workers who earn between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000 a year but, perhaps because they are on contract or self-employed, or work in small companies, are not offered a company scheme. Do I have to be in work to take one out? No. One of the big innovations in stakeholder is that you can earn tax relief on the money you put in even if you are not working. This means that, for the first time, people without employment will be able to contribute to a pension or get someone else to contribute on their behalf and obtain basic-rate tax relief on the contributions. Why don't I buy an Isa or invest in property for my retirement instead? Because of the tax relief on stakeholder pensions. You can make payments of up to \u00a33,600 a year (\u00a3300 per month) into a stakeholder and earn full tax relief on all the money. This means the government is giving you a 22% or 40% bonus depending on your tax band. I already have a company pension. Should I switch? Almost certainly not. The contributions that an employer makes into your pension far outweigh any benefits that an individual stakeholder pension will give you. But you may be able to buy a stakeholder as well. The rules allow anyone in a company scheme earning less than \u00a330,000 a year to invest in a stakeholder too. And the \u00a33,600 allowance comes on top of the maximum 15% of salary you are allowed to contribute each year into an occupational scheme. I already have a personal pension. Should I switch to a stakeholder? As stakeholders are designed to be cheaper and more flexible than personal pensions, you should look into doing so. Your decision should rest on the size of exit penalty you might face and the length of time you have contributed to a personal pension. The longer you have saved, the less worthwhile it will be to switch. If my employer offers a stakeholder, should I take it? It depends on whether your employer is offering to pay any contributions into the plan. If they are, it will usually be a good idea to join this plan rather than go elsewhere. But do oppose any move by your employer to close down an existing company pension scheme and offer a stakeholder instead. Will I still get the state pension? Yes. The aim of stakeholder is to give a top-up pension to people on lower and middle incomes. Will I pay tax on the income from my stakeholder pension, and will it hit my benefits? Yes and yes. The income from your stakeholder will be treated like any other income (and any other pension) and will be taxable. A much thornier issue is the benefits problem. For poorer people, the income earned from the stakeholder pension may simply mean that other income, such as housing benefit, will be reduced pound-for-pound. Will all stakeholder pensions be the same? Not quite. The rules mean they all charge no more than 1% a year, but the final pension pot you receive will depend on how successful they are at investing your money. \u0095 A government-backed helpline run by the Pensions Advisory Service (Opas) on 084-601-2923 (www.stakeholderhelpline.org.uk) offers free information on stakeholder pensions from 8.30am to 6.30pm, Monday to Friday with calls charged at local rates. Impartial information on stakeholders is also available from the Financial Services Authority, the main watchdog, on its consumer helpline 0845-606-1234 or website www.fsa.gov.uk/consumer. Also online is the government's impartial pensions website at www.pensionguide.gov.uk.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, I spent some time at the British Antiques Dealers Association (Bada) annual Antiques &amp; Fine Art Fair at the Duke of York's Headquarters off London's Kings Road. Earlier this year, the Bada gathering was voted Fair of the Year at the British Antiques and Collectables Awards. </p> <p>The shortlist included the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair and The Olympia Fine Art and Antiques Fair. </p> <p>The Bada fair is probably less elitist than the Grosvenor House Fair and more relaxed than the Olympia Fair. Perhaps akin to what the Provincial Booksellers Fair is to, say, the Antiquarian Booksellers Fair - rather more affordable and less rarified. </p> <p>But this comparison does not really hold up since the Bada is a far more diverse event than any book fair. Around 90 dealers (from a membership of about 400) gather over a broad range of antiques and fine art including furniture, paintings, drawings, glass, ceramics, clocks and barometers, textiles, silver and jewellery. </p> <p>Each participant is a carefully vetted contributor, so all the items are genuine antiques and a cut above charity shops and wares from car boot sales. </p> <p>Having said that, goods were affordable though there was also some very fancy prices. A massive and very heavy French parcel - a gilt jewel casket, made for Charles X of France with scenes from the life of Don Quixote was priced at \u00a3350,000. </p> <p>There were no Old Masters or Expressionist paintings, but an oil painting by John Duncan Ferguson, one of the Scottish colourists who had such a successful exhibition at the Royal Academy last year, did appear. Through the Trees, South of France, painted circa 1924, was on sale for \u00a385,000. </p> <p>Leaving aside these top items, I wanted to see how prices stacked up against those in London auctions in the past year or so. </p> <p>It was a fairly meaningless exercise. Auctions are gladiatorial. If two collectors desperately want an item then prices can do anything at all, really taking off into the stratosphere. </p> <p>There was no bargaining at Bada and, broadly speaking, prices were in line with what you might pay at auction. Georgian furniture such as George III mahogany bureaus or tables were anything from \u00a310,000 to \u00a385,000, which is in line with what such pieces fetched at a spate of country house sales by Christie's earlier this year. </p> <p>A dinner set of Staffordshire ceramics would sell for at least \u00a33,000, with individual pieces commanding from the high hundreds of pounds to the low thousands. </p> <p>Clocks and barometers from the 18th-century onwards, which are in great demand just now, were on sale from anything from \u00a33,000 to \u00a315,000, again what you would expect to pay in the main salerooms. </p> <p>As I cannot afford to pay anything like these prices until I have cleared another 10 years of school fees and probably not even then, I decided to award myself a notional \u00a320,000, like one of those fantasy share columns, and see what I could purchase. It was not so much to add to collections but to buy things I liked that I also thought would appreciate in value. </p> <p> My first port of call was Duncan Miller, an art dealer with galleries in London's Hampstead and St James. It was he who had the John Duncan Ferguson along with a number of other Scottish colourists, including an oil painting by Samuel Peploe (1871-1935) called Landscape, Near Comrie. This was a small, 6ins, mellow view and I thought it a bargain at \u00a314,000. </p> <p>I moved on to glass. I do very much like heavy Georgian pieces. Mark West had some lovely early 18th-century balusters. But he persuaded me to look at Victorian engraved glass. </p> <p>He said: \"Of all things, I think I have been most fascinated by this. The glass was made in England, but the engravers usually came from Germany. The pieces are not often named, but Joseph Keller is on this one.\" </p> <p>The glass is lighter than Georgian wares, but not too fine, and the engravings are ornate. I paid a notional \u00a32,000 for a champagne breakfast set, a decanter and two glasses. Mark West told me that, five years ago, I could have purchased it for \u00a3500. </p> <p>I thought about buying some Victorian watercolours, which started at \u00a3450, but decided I had enough of these and settled on some knick-knacks. Anybody who likes Treen would have a field day at Bernard Gulley's display. Treen is defined in the dictionary as \"to do with wood\"; it usually means carved wood. I bought, or at least notionally bought, a flat pronged, metal vegetable fork, with a handle carved from ash for \u00a3125. </p> <p>A mahogany bootjack was \u00a385 and, finally, there was a lovely Burr Birch Scandace bowl, which was honey coloured, for \u00a3280, and looked like a Lucy Rie sculpture ceramic, only in wood. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information about the fair or the dealers mentioned telephone Cawdell-Douglas on 020-7439-2822.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week, I spent some time at the British Antiques Dealers Association (Bada) annual Antiques &amp; Fine Art Fair at the Duke of York's Headquarters off London's Kings Road. Earlier this year, the Bada gathering was voted Fair of the Year at the British Antiques and Collectables Awards. The shortlist included the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair and The Olympia Fine Art and Antiques Fair. The Bada fair is probably less elitist than the Grosvenor House Fair and more relaxed than the Olympia Fair. Perhaps akin to what the Provincial Booksellers Fair is to, say, the Antiquarian Booksellers Fair - rather more affordable and less rarified. But this comparison does not really hold up since the Bada is a far more diverse event than any book fair. Around 90 dealers (from a membership of about 400) gather over a broad range of antiques and fine art including furniture, paintings, drawings, glass, ceramics, clocks and barometers, textiles, silver and jewellery. Each participant is a carefully vetted contributor, so all the items are genuine antiques and a cut above charity shops and wares from car boot sales. Having said that, goods were affordable though there was also some very fancy prices. A massive and very heavy French parcel - a gilt jewel casket, made for Charles X of France with scenes from the life of Don Quixote was priced at \u00a3350,000. There were no Old Masters or Expressionist paintings, but an oil painting by John Duncan Ferguson, one of the Scottish colourists who had such a successful exhibition at the Royal Academy last year, did appear. Through the Trees, South of France, painted circa 1924, was on sale for \u00a385,000. Leaving aside these top items, I wanted to see how prices stacked up against those in London auctions in the past year or so. It was a fairly meaningless exercise. Auctions are gladiatorial. If two collectors desperately want an item then prices can do anything at all, really taking off into the stratosphere. There was no bargaining at Bada and, broadly speaking, prices were in line with what you might pay at auction. Georgian furniture such as George III mahogany bureaus or tables were anything from \u00a310,000 to \u00a385,000, which is in line with what such pieces fetched at a spate of country house sales by Christie's earlier this year. A dinner set of Staffordshire ceramics would sell for at least \u00a33,000, with individual pieces commanding from the high hundreds of pounds to the low thousands. Clocks and barometers from the 18th-century onwards, which are in great demand just now, were on sale from anything from \u00a33,000 to \u00a315,000, again what you would expect to pay in the main salerooms. As I cannot afford to pay anything like these prices until I have cleared another 10 years of school fees and probably not even then, I decided to award myself a notional \u00a320,000, like one of those fantasy share columns, and see what I could purchase. It was not so much to add to collections but to buy things I liked that I also thought would appreciate in value. My first port of call was Duncan Miller, an art dealer with galleries in London's Hampstead and St James. It was he who had the John Duncan Ferguson along with a number of other Scottish colourists, including an oil painting by Samuel Peploe (1871-1935) called Landscape, Near Comrie. This was a small, 6ins, mellow view and I thought it a bargain at \u00a314,000. I moved on to glass. I do very much like heavy Georgian pieces. Mark West had some lovely early 18th-century balusters. But he persuaded me to look at Victorian engraved glass. He said: \"Of all things, I think I have been most fascinated by this. The glass was made in England, but the engravers usually came from Germany. The pieces are not often named, but Joseph Keller is on this one.\" The glass is lighter than Georgian wares, but not too fine, and the engravings are ornate. I paid a notional \u00a32,000 for a champagne breakfast set, a decanter and two glasses. Mark West told me that, five years ago, I could have purchased it for \u00a3500. I thought about buying some Victorian watercolours, which started at \u00a3450, but decided I had enough of these and settled on some knick-knacks. Anybody who likes Treen would have a field day at Bernard Gulley's display. Treen is defined in the dictionary as \"to do with wood\"; it usually means carved wood. I bought, or at least notionally bought, a flat pronged, metal vegetable fork, with a handle carved from ash for \u00a3125. A mahogany bootjack was \u00a385 and, finally, there was a lovely Burr Birch Scandace bowl, which was honey coloured, for \u00a3280, and looked like a Lucy Rie sculpture ceramic, only in wood. \u0095 For further information about the fair or the dealers mentioned telephone Cawdell-Douglas on 020-7439-2822.",

      "body": "<p>While travel insurance is now seen as mandatory for trips outside Europe, just a quarter of homeowners have their mortgage payments - most people's biggest monthly outgoing - covered. </p> <p>This has contributed to the alarming statistic that 50% of homeowners would be unable to meet their housing costs if they lost their job. Research from the Association of British Insurers shows that most people do not realise how limited state assistance is if they do fall into arrears. </p> <p>The ABI found that a \"worrying proportion\" of consumers - one in five - believe they could rely on the government to provide them with financial assistance if they were unable to find work. </p> <p>In fact, state benefits to support mortgage repayments are means tested and even people who are eligible generally have to wait for up to nine months before they receive their first benefit payment. Also payments only cover mortgage interest and not the outstanding capital debt. </p> <p>Around a third of those questioned who do not have mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) say they would rely on their savings if their income were to drop significantly. However, the average household has just \u00a3750 in liquid assets. </p> <p>With chancellor Gordon Brown insisting that Britain will not return to boom and bust - a major feature of which was repossessions - it is understandable that the majority of people do not rate losing their job, and the effect that would have on their ability to pay their mortgage, as a major consideration. But these findings may add to the pressure on the government to make MPPI compulsory. </p> <p>Mary Francis, director-general of the Association of British Insurers, says: \"This report certainly gave us food for thought. One key concern is the lack of awareness of just how limited government help is for mortgage holders who become unemployed. </p> <p>\"Mortgage payment protection insurance has recently been given a facelift by insurers, lenders and the government through their sustainable home ownership project. Policies must now meet or exceed minimum standards in terms of the cover offered.\" </p> <p>In 1999 an MPPIs standard was introduced in an attempt to encourage more people to take out policies. These minimum standards required all policies to pay out after 60 days - some had previously forced claimants to wait for four months. </p> <p>The ABI findings also showed that a large majority of people who have taken out MPPIs, and have made a claim, have found their policy to be effective. </p> <p>But a report from a mortgage industry magazine, Mortgage Finance Gazette, questions the value of payment-protection products. It shows that 41% of mortgage lenders think the products have no, or very little, impact on the arrears situation, although they do help the indebted individual. </p> <p>Almost half of the companies questioned said they would press on with court action even if a borrower had MPPI cover. </p> <p>John Collins, a Swansea-based lawyer and joint author of the report, says: \"There are any number of reasons for a company taking such a line - the level of cover might be inadequate or the payments under the policy might go to the borrower rather than the lender, so leading to underpayment or non-payment of the mortgage.\" </p> <p>And insurer Goodfellows says its research shows that, where MPPI payments are made, they are insufficient and fail to pay for the basic needs of food, clothing and travel. This week it has launched a protection plan which is, it says, a cover for basic living expenses, not just mortgage protection. Shelter replaces up to 75% of lost gross earnings for up to two years.

      "bodyText": "While travel insurance is now seen as mandatory for trips outside Europe, just a quarter of homeowners have their mortgage payments - most people's biggest monthly outgoing - covered. This has contributed to the alarming statistic that 50% of homeowners would be unable to meet their housing costs if they lost their job. Research from the Association of British Insurers shows that most people do not realise how limited state assistance is if they do fall into arrears. The ABI found that a \"worrying proportion\" of consumers - one in five - believe they could rely on the government to provide them with financial assistance if they were unable to find work. In fact, state benefits to support mortgage repayments are means tested and even people who are eligible generally have to wait for up to nine months before they receive their first benefit payment. Also payments only cover mortgage interest and not the outstanding capital debt. Around a third of those questioned who do not have mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) say they would rely on their savings if their income were to drop significantly. However, the average household has just \u00a3750 in liquid assets. With chancellor Gordon Brown insisting that Britain will not return to boom and bust - a major feature of which was repossessions - it is understandable that the majority of people do not rate losing their job, and the effect that would have on their ability to pay their mortgage, as a major consideration. But these findings may add to the pressure on the government to make MPPI compulsory. Mary Francis, director-general of the Association of British Insurers, says: \"This report certainly gave us food for thought. One key concern is the lack of awareness of just how limited government help is for mortgage holders who become unemployed. \"Mortgage payment protection insurance has recently been given a facelift by insurers, lenders and the government through their sustainable home ownership project. Policies must now meet or exceed minimum standards in terms of the cover offered.\" In 1999 an MPPIs standard was introduced in an attempt to encourage more people to take out policies. These minimum standards required all policies to pay out after 60 days - some had previously forced claimants to wait for four months. The ABI findings also showed that a large majority of people who have taken out MPPIs, and have made a claim, have found their policy to be effective. But a report from a mortgage industry magazine, Mortgage Finance Gazette, questions the value of payment-protection products. It shows that 41% of mortgage lenders think the products have no, or very little, impact on the arrears situation, although they do help the indebted individual. Almost half of the companies questioned said they would press on with court action even if a borrower had MPPI cover. John Collins, a Swansea-based lawyer and joint author of the report, says: \"There are any number of reasons for a company taking such a line - the level of cover might be inadequate or the payments under the policy might go to the borrower rather than the lender, so leading to underpayment or non-payment of the mortgage.\" And insurer Goodfellows says its research shows that, where MPPI payments are made, they are insufficient and fail to pay for the basic needs of food, clothing and travel. This week it has launched a protection plan which is, it says, a cover for basic living expenses, not just mortgage protection. Shelter replaces up to 75% of lost gross earnings for up to two years. To provide cover of \u00a31,000 a month, in the event of unemployment, costs \u00a325 a month for a year's cover or \u00a330 to be covered for two years. Goodfellows' managing director, Simon Burgess, says: \"The Mortgage Finance Gazette's findings contrast with ours.

One is the contrast between the idealistic naivete of the national serviceman and the entrenched attitudes of the old sweats who have been through a war. But the play is also about the artificial barriers, sexual and political, we erect between human beings. Propositioned by the young \"American\", Pat is seriously tempted, only to find himself up on a charge of bringing a Soviet spy into the centre. Whelan's point is that the 1950s' demonisation of both Russians and homosexuals led to failures of understanding. The postwar world, he implies, might have been a better place if both the cold war and our sexual paranoia had been prematurely thawed. </p> <p>Sometimes you feel Whelan yokes together dissimilar things: there was, after all, good reason to be suspicious of the Russians after the Berlin blockade of 1948, which led even Aneurin Bevan to call for the despatch of allied tanks. And, technically, the device of setting the action inside Pat's memory seems redundant. But this is still a wonderfully written play that conjures up, in a Le Carr\u00e9-like way, the equivocal mystery of 1950s Berlin and that follows its own principles by refusing to dehumanise the enemy. Even the army intelligence sergeant, who sees reds in as well as under the bed, is a shrewd operator, who argues you have to read War and Peace to understand the thinking Russian. </p> <p>Robert Delamere's atmospheric production is superbly designed by Simon Higlett, with evocative tramlines running through the centre of the broken-windowed Charlottenburg house.

At the height of his unpopularity a candidate for the Sack Graham Taylor Party won 80 votes in the Christchurch by-election of 1993. </p> <p>Now a familiar hunt begins. The last time he left Vicarage Road Watford were relegated within 12 months, starting a 10-year period of failure as they searched desperately for an adequate replacement.

After 1,020 league games, he has won seven promotions and a record 29 manager-of-the-month awards. \"It's very sad to hear that such a fine manager is going to leave the game,\" said the Derby manager Jim Smith, who played with Taylor at Lincoln and is one of only two other people to have overseen 1,000 league games. \"He is undoubtedly one of the outstanding managers of his generation and has set a fine example for anyone aspiring to be successful in football.\" Only a crisis-filled spell in charge of England, in which he lost to the United States, failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup and gave Carlton Palmer 18 caps, took the shine off his managerial career. At the height of his unpopularity a candidate for the Sack Graham Taylor Party won 80 votes in the Christchurch by-election of 1993. Now a familiar hunt begins. The last time he left Vicarage Road Watford were relegated within 12 months, starting a 10-year period of failure as they searched desperately for an adequate replacement. In 1997 they found their man: Graham Taylor again. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

For some, however, this may already be too much. </p> <p>Look at England's victories over Finland and Albania another way. But for David Seaman's late save from Jari Litmanen at Anfield, and the linesman's flag that denied Albania a second goal in stoppage-time to level the scores at 2-2 in the Qemal Stafa stadium, Eriksson's team might have been held to two draws. </p> <p>The difference between lying a comfortable second in their World Cup qualifying group and lagging behind has been that fine.

A bad error by Rio Ferdinand cost England one goal and the narrow, though correct, offside decision spared them another. </p> <p>So far, then, it has been a case of England's excellent moments in attack staying ahead of their defensive errors, but only by a whisker. So long as Paul Scholes and Michael Owen stay fit and in form this should continue to be the case. </p> <p>In Tirana, David Beckham enjoyed another thoughtful, busy game as captain. His crosses were as near to perfection as made no difference and, until England's first goal, only his free-kicks had brought Foto Strakosha into serious action. </p> <p>Yet it was Scholes, solidly supported by Nicky Butt, the expected replacement for the injured Steven Gerrard, who held a bridgehead in midfield and consistently broke up opposing attacks as Albania grew more confident going forward.

      "body": "<p>Here I am in Sydney. </p> <p>It is a lovely city built around the huge harbour and sprawling along the coast to include all the famous surfing beaches. I hadn't realised before that these were part of the city. Bits of it remind me of London, but newer and cleaner, and there are lots of familiar district names - Waterloo, King's Cross, Paddington, etc. An abundance of parks make it a very green city, and it's very easy to get around by bus and train. I've never been on a double decker tube before. </p> <p>On Sunday Annie, whom I'm staying with, took me up to the Blue Mountains - but cloud and drizzle obscured what is obviously a beautiful area. We kept walking to the Three Sisters rock formation from different approaches waiting for breaks in the mist so that I could get a photo. Our planned walk also had to be curtailed due to a landslide so it was not a lucky day, but enjoyable none the less. </p> <p>Annie lives half way between Bondi Beach and Coogie, where Millie is, so I spent Monday exploring the area, beginning with a walk along the coastal path to Bondi and a little paddle in the surf. I don't think I'll be adding surfing to my list of new accomplishments. I then went into the city for a look around the harbour (some of the luxury riverside houses matched London in price), and later headed back to meet Milly in the evening for a meal and a drink. We had many fruitless but funny attempts to take a photo of ourselves, finally giving in and asking the barman. He was somewhat bemused to be given two identical digital cameras and asked to take a photo with each. We both agreed that the majority of travellers are about 22-25, with a lot of women in their late 20s travelling alone. The thought of travelling on my own was daunting to me - how much scarier it must be at 18.</p> <p>On Tuesday I went on a day trip to Canberra.The long journey meant that I wasn't left with much time once I was there, but it was worth it to catch a glimpse of this beautiful new city, planned to include large green spaces and to blend into the surrounding countryside. We drove past all the embassies, the architecture of each reflecting their countries of origin (the British Consulate was very boring). On the green outside the old parliament building stood a rickety wooden shed ironically labelled the Aboriginal Embassy, and covered in political statements. </p> <p>We then went on to the new Parliament House, built into a hill with the roof covered in grass to echo the landscape. The architecture and interior design of this building is lovely. Both houses were sitting and it was 'question time', with John Howard in full flow. One British legacy that the Australians could have abandoned but obviously did not, is the yaboo and bad manners of politicians noisily expressing their approval or otherwise of whoever is speaking. </p> <p>A quick zoom into the National Art Gallery and it was off to the War Memorial. I had wondered why we were given as much time here as at Parliament House but it actually is a very beautiful place with a large and impressive exhibition centre. In former times I have painted little lead soldiers to earn an extra crust, so I was appreciative of the model diaramas depicting battles. I also found a Stubbings in the roll of honour, an airman killed in the second world war - no relation as far as I know. Any spare minutes on the trip were spent scribbling down the names of places recommended by Cheryl from California who has travelled extensively in South America. It was a long but interesting day. </p> <p>On Wednesday I took myself by ferry to Taronga Zoo. I'm not a great fan of zoos but felt I couldn't leave Oz without seeing either a koala or an emu. As far as zoos go this one is good: the animals live as naturally as is possible. You could have your photo taken next to a koala lounging on a branch for two dollars, but the queue was so long that I decided the website could live without that shot. </p> <p>On Thusday I was supposed to be going to Manley but, feeling lazy, I opted for a walk to the nearby Bronti Bay to chill out on the beach, watching the surfers and reading a book. Four months into this trip I am beginning to realise that I can allow myself the odd day off from travelling and sightseeing, and that this is actually a holiday. It always feels so much like a race against time to see as much as possible, knowing that I probably will not come back to many, if any, of these places. I am already in a panic about how to get round all there is to see in New Zealand in a mere three weeks. </p> <p>I had a wonderful finale to my week and my stay with Annie. Following Sam and Milly's example I had to go to the Opera House, and we were lucky enough to get tickets for Kennedy - formerly known as Nigel - playing Elgar's Violin Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. In such a magnificent theatre, with champagne on the balcony overlooking the harbour, watching Kennedy who was as ever the flamboyant virtuoso, it was a lovely evening. How many highlights can a person pack into six months? </p> <p>It has been good staying with Annie, a welcome break from hostels. I have met so many kind, hospitable people over the course of the trip - in fact, I'm off to see some more this evening as I'm meeting up with Simon and his wife, who contacted me on the website. This aspect of the travelling has been a real bonus. </p> <p>So - off to New Zealand on Sunday. Perhaps the secret is not to try and see everything but to concentrate on a few areas. But which ones? I think I have decided to hire a car. Perhaps by next week I will have made some decisions. (Can you tell I am a Libran?)</p>",

Annie lives half way between Bondi Beach and Coogie, where Millie is, so I spent Monday exploring the area, beginning with a walk along the coastal path to Bondi and a little paddle in the surf. I don't think I'll be adding surfing to my list of new accomplishments. I then went into the city for a look around the harbour (some of the luxury riverside houses matched London in price), and later headed back to meet Milly in the evening for a meal and a drink. We had many fruitless but funny attempts to take a photo of ourselves, finally giving in and asking the barman. He was somewhat bemused to be given two identical digital cameras and asked to take a photo with each. We both agreed that the majority of travellers are about 22-25, with a lot of women in their late 20s travelling alone. The thought of travelling on my own was daunting to me - how much scarier it must be at 18. On Tuesday I went on a day trip to Canberra.The long journey meant that I wasn't left with much time once I was there, but it was worth it to catch a glimpse of this beautiful new city, planned to include large green spaces and to blend into the surrounding countryside. We drove past all the embassies, the architecture of each reflecting their countries of origin (the British Consulate was very boring). On the green outside the old parliament building stood a rickety wooden shed ironically labelled the Aboriginal Embassy, and covered in political statements. We then went on to the new Parliament House, built into a hill with the roof covered in grass to echo the landscape. The architecture and interior design of this building is lovely. Both houses were sitting and it was 'question time', with John Howard in full flow. One British legacy that the Australians could have abandoned but obviously did not, is the yaboo and bad manners of politicians noisily expressing their approval or otherwise of whoever is speaking. A quick zoom into the National Art Gallery and it was off to the War Memorial. I had wondered why we were given as much time here as at Parliament House but it actually is a very beautiful place with a large and impressive exhibition centre. In former times I have painted little lead soldiers to earn an extra crust, so I was appreciative of the model diaramas depicting battles. I also found a Stubbings in the roll of honour, an airman killed in the second world war - no relation as far as I know. Any spare minutes on the trip were spent scribbling down the names of places recommended by Cheryl from California who has travelled extensively in South America. It was a long but interesting day. On Wednesday I took myself by ferry to Taronga Zoo. I'm not a great fan of zoos but felt I couldn't leave Oz without seeing either a koala or an emu. As far as zoos go this one is good: the animals live as naturally as is possible. You could have your photo taken next to a koala lounging on a branch for two dollars, but the queue was so long that I decided the website could live without that shot. On Thusday I was supposed to be going to Manley but, feeling lazy, I opted for a walk to the nearby Bronti Bay to chill out on the beach, watching the surfers and reading a book. Four months into this trip I am beginning to realise that I can allow myself the odd day off from travelling and sightseeing, and that this is actually a holiday. It always feels so much like a race against time to see as much as possible, knowing that I probably will not come back to many, if any, of these places. I am already in a panic about how to get round all there is to see in New Zealand in a mere three weeks. I had a wonderful finale to my week and my stay with Annie. Following Sam and Milly's example I had to go to the Opera House, and we were lucky enough to get tickets for Kennedy - formerly known as Nigel - playing Elgar's Violin Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. In such a magnificent theatre, with champagne on the balcony overlooking the harbour, watching Kennedy who was as ever the flamboyant virtuoso, it was a lovely evening. How many highlights can a person pack into six months? It has been good staying with Annie, a welcome break from hostels. I have met so many kind, hospitable people over the course of the trip - in fact, I'm off to see some more this evening as I'm meeting up with Simon and his wife, who contacted me on the website. This aspect of the travelling has been a real bonus. So - off to New Zealand on Sunday. Perhaps the secret is not to try and see everything but to concentrate on a few areas. But which ones? I think I have decided to hire a car. Perhaps by next week I will have made some decisions. (Can you tell I am a Libran?)",

At <a href=\"http://www.ragdalehall.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Ragdale Hall</a>, near Nottingham, where my daughter and I spent a few blissful days last month, the food was delicious and plentiful, and I didn't spot anyone who looked remotely glamorous.</p> <p>The point is, and this is the thing you need to get used to as soon as you arrive, everyone gets to be princess for the day. Our family annals record that when said daughter was three years old she appeared one day tastefully got up in tatters of satin, velvet and lace from the dressing up box and announced solemnly, \"Today I princess Mummy.

Everything's there for you, from smiling Dave who materialises to take your luggage before you even open the car door, to Joanne who whisks you to comfortable sofas for cups of tea while you fill in forms about your health and what you want for tomorrow's breakfast, to dapper Paul who gives you a personal guided tour, to the personalised schedule showing when your back will be massaged and your dinner served. </p> <p>Everything works like very quiet clockwork and it needs to. Ragdale Hall is a complex operation combining a traditional country hotel, all oak pannelling and comfortable chairs, an up to the minute health club with a well-equipped gym and two exercise studios for the non-stop programme of aerobic and yogic exercise, a beauty centre for facials, massages and so on, and of course a spa area with steam room, jacuzzi, sauna and swimming pool. </p> <p>I didn't do too much in the beauty centre, though I loved the winter garden where you wait for your treatments, and hung out there till daughter emerged from a facial and massage, swearing that from now on she would use a proper moisturiser. The classes were great. I survived an hour's aerobic workout - how could I stop when next to me was a bloke who could give me 10 stone and 10 years? - and was convinced by the pilates tutor that this was the way forward.

I lost count of how many times we slipped into the spa to swim, steam, enjoy the massage jets, interrupted only by endless hot showers, cosseted by endless fluffy white towels. Mysteriously we always seemed to have the pool to ourselves. The steam room too. I discovered that as the minutes pass and the steam creeps over you and into your skin nothing else seems to matter, and all that fuss over deadlines last week recedes to an infinite distance. </p> <p>Even the drop-in exercise classes were never crowded. Obviously a law is operating. Actually I think I know what it is. We arrived exhausted but hyperactive, launched into a 24 hour flurry of trying everything, then began to slow down, pace ourselves, rest and recover. Then on the third day it was time to go. I suspect that those fortunate enough to stay longer are not littering up the action areas but have taken themselves off to one of the delicious quiet rooms where you simply do nothing, I mean nothing, in complete tranquillity until the next meal. If that wears off you can reposition yourself in one of the cafe areas and if it's not too much trouble enjoy a little light chat over a cappuccino or fruit juice.

      "bodyText": "The voluntary sector has a key role in fixing the problems caused by a decline in social cohesion in the UK, community regeneration guru Robert Putnam told charity leaders today. The Harvard University professor said voluntary organisations must be at the forefront of finding new methods of bringing communities together despite cultural and other differences. He urged the government to create of a form of national service - a compulsory year of community work for young people - as a way of helping build up the capacity of the voluntary sector to address social problems. Professor Putnam was addressing the Third Sector Foresight conference in London, hosted by the National Council of Voluntary Organisations. The professor, who has been dubbed prime minister Tony Blair's \"new favourite guru\", said Britain had previously shown the way in tackling social breakdowns during the early 1900s, when a range of community institutions were created in the wake of the industrial revolution. \"Most social institutions such as the Boy Scouts were founded during this time and Britain led the way. We now need a similar concentrated period of civic inventiveness.\" Prof Putnam has been touring Britain and Ireland this week, dropping into 10 Downing Street on Tuesday to advise Mr Blair and gaining widespread publicity for his book, Bowling Alone. He said the debate should not be about whether social disintegration in the UK was more or less of a problem than in the US, but that effort should be made to increase what he calls \"social capital\" on both sides of the Atlantic. Prof Putnam's message is that society needs to build more social capital, which he defines as \"social networks, which have norms of reciprocity\". \"All societies are underfunded when it comes to social capital, \" he said. Developing social capital would have a positive effect on health, wealth and democracy, he said. These networks can be anything from neighbourhood watch schemes to sports teams. Prof Putnam added that the sector needs to assess what kinds of social capital are useful and find ways of generating them. He warned that there is often a negative correlation between social capital and diverse communities - that the more similar a community the easier it is to create social networks.

He is a Harvard University professor and social analyst who has charted the collapse of civic and community values in the USA. His message, as outlined in his book Bowling Alone: the Collapse and Revival of American Community, is that unless new forms of social engagement are developed, our stock of \"social capital\" (the concept that community networks have an inherent value) will decline and the future for society will be bleak. <strong>What's happened in the US?</strong><br> His research found that Americans are less likely than they were three decades ago to participate in community meetings and organisations. Membership of charities, churches, trade unions, and 10-pin bowling leagues has gone down; families are less likely eat dinner together, know their neighbours or even watch television together. <strong>Do we suffer from social breakdown in the same way?</strong><br> Yes, suspects the professor: \"Some evidence suggests that Europe is about to follow the American pattern with a lag of a few decades. Europe may have a social capital 'cold', but not yet the full-blown American 'pneumonia'.\" A report recently published by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations in the UK found that public involvement in clubs, societies and voluntary activities has declined over the last 10 years. <strong>Is this simply nostalgia for a lost way of life?</strong><br> The professor claims there is a direct link between social involvement and quality of life: communities with high levels of civic engagement have lower crime rates, better schools, lower levels of teen pregnancy, and less child abuse, drug use and juvenile delinquency. Governments are more responsive, honest and efficient, citizens to pay taxes and fulfil other civic obligations. \"Connected\" people live longer, happier lives. \"You tell me how many choral societies there are in an Italian region, and I will tell you plus or minus three days how long it will take you to get your health bills reimbursed by its regional government,\" Professor Putnam once quipped. <strong>Why is Tony Blair so interested?</strong><br> The theory offers a relatively simple, cheap, organic, perhaps even miraculous solutions to seemingly intractable social ills. It also dovetails nicely with the ideology shared to varying degrees by politicians on both the right and left, that the state should not monopolise the provision of social action programmes, but that faith groups, social entrepreneurs and charities should play more of a role. <strong>Does anyone disagree with Prof Putnam?</strong><br> Public health minister and new Labour rising star Yvette Cooper took him to task for \"romancticising\" the concept of community in a Downing Street seminar held this week. Some communities can stifle and repress, she reportedly argued: \"My grandparents knew their neighbours but they were also absolutely terrified of what the neighbours thought. Social capital can become vested interests, the old boy's network.\" <strong>How does Prof Putnam want to rebuild social capital?</strong><br> Devolve government decision making down to community and neighbourhood level, introduce family-friendly employment policies to allow people to spend more time with family and friends, and educate youth in \"civic responsibilities.\" <strong>You explain the reference to bowling, incidentally?</strong><br> Prof Putnam uses the decline of 10-pin bowling leagues in the US over the last 25 years as a metaphor for the gradual increase in social isolation. More people go bowling, he says, but they do so alone. \"When you participate in a bowling league, interacting regularly with the same people week after week, you learn and practice what de Tocqueville called 'habits of the heart.'

Along with the 1,100 extra places created over the past two years, the new places represent a 50% rise in medical school intakes since 1998. Education and employment minister, Tessa Blackstone, hoped the new places would attract students from a much broader range of social and ethnic backgrounds. Leeds and Bradford Universities, who collaborated in their bid for more medical placements, said they would recruit students from a broad range of backgrounds, and the University of Birmingham said it will seek to attract increasing numbers of students from local, socially deprived areas. Further placements have been awarded to the Universities of Newcastle and Durham, which included in their joint bid an access strategy, based at Durham's Stockton campus. Sir Martin Harris, chairman of Universities UK Health Committee, welcomed the additional places, but warned: \"At the same time it's vital to ensure that a medical career is made sufficiently attractive for young - and middle young - people to aspire to it.\" The two new schools are collaborations between the Universities of Hull and York and Sussex and Brighton. They follow the establishments last year of the Peninsula Medical School, a collaboration between Plymouth and Exeter Unviversities, and a new school at the University of East Anglia.

The city is safe, clean and well organised, with good opportunities for earning money, but a high cost of living and the less than friendly locals can make teaching here a sometimes frustrating experience. </p> <p>6.10am: Rise and shine. Make my way through our tiny, one bed flat to the shower room. All accommodation here is measured in square metres, is very expensive and needs more connections than Don Corleone to find in the first place. Expect to compete with 90 odd other hopefuls, should you get to the viewing stage of responding to a small ad - either that or be prepared to offer a belohnung (bribe) to secure somewhere. I was lucky enough to have a resident boyfriend with a flat that we can just about both squeeze into. We pay 900DM (\u00a3284), including bills, per month, which is cheap.</p> <p>After a quick review of my lesson plan I clip my briefcase onto my bike and start the half an hour cycle along the Isar, Munich's main river, to my first lesson - a one-to-one with a marketing manager at a tobacco company. I work at this company three times a week, all for different language schools, paying different wages. In total, I work for about six different language schools at any one time, juggling two-hour-long business classes with intensive courses for the Volkshochschule (VHS). </p> <p>Yvonne, my first client, is a fairly typical student. She was brought up in East Germany and therefore learned Russian at school, as opposed to Germans brought up in the West, who will have had at least five years of schooling in English. She self-studied intensively so now has a good speaking level of English, but needs to work on functional, job-specific language for tasks such as presentations - the overlap between language skills and management training can be pretty big sometimes.</p> <p>Munich, as the second Silicon Valley of Europe, is a rapidly expanding, very wealthy city with a booming new economy sector and a highly profitable, well established traditional sector. Having companies such as GMX, a wealth of soft and hardware firms plus old timers like Siemens, BMW, Philip Morris and a burgeoning pharmaceuticals sector all trading internationally, mean there is a massive requirement for the English language. Because of people like Yvonne, the demand for Business English trainers is huge and there are hundreds of language schools all crying out for qualified native speakers. </p> <p>If you just turn up here, send your CV off to any of the language schools listed in the Gelbeseiten (yellow pages), or look in the jobs section of Munich Found, an English language journal, expect to be inundated with offers of work almost immediately. The schools vary somewhat in level of support and pay, but you should receive around 40DM per hour. Once you're established and speak some German, you can approach the companies directly and take home up to 120DM per hour. You can also use any of the EFL websites to find a job before you get here, as many schools advertise.</p> <p>9:00am: The lesson went well, using some resources gleaned from a speaker at the last BESIG conference, held last autumn in Munich. Back on the bike through the traffic jammed streets to my next lesson. Biking is usually the quickest way to travel in the city and quite safe - there are kilometres of well maintained cycle ways and cyclists generally get priority over cars. There's also a fast, clean underground network (the S and U-bahns) which isn't too expensive either, but I prefer the independence of my bike.</p> <p>9:20am: Head up to my beautiful new multimedia classroom in the VHS buildings. I have a class of 14 elementary adult learners, all highly motivated and enthusiastic, and all from different countries. A first glance around the immaculately dressed, white faces in Marienplatz gives the impression that Munich is not a multicultural city. But a closer listen will reveal Turks, Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Italians, Poles and many other nationalities. Just as well, really, as the Bavarians are not the friendliest folk in the world. Even if you get past the language barrier, you'll find it hard to get a response that isn't grumpy. Unless you're in a beer garden, of course.</p> <p>12:30pm: A task-based lesson using specially designed course books, all provided by the VHS, that was fun and productive. You are really well looked after as a teacher here: not only are there teacher's book shops galore, but the VHS and many other schools have good libraries to borrow from and there is a teacher's support group - MELTA - which puts on regular seminars and meetings.</p> <p>1pm: Back home for lunch. </p> <p>2pm: Time to organise my accounts. Every selbstandig (freelance) teacher has to send off accounts to the Finanzamt up to three times a year to work out your Mehrwertsteuer (VAT) and income tax liability. I would recommend getting a tax lawyer to advise you as paperwork is something of a German speciality and can be daunting. Something to be aware of is the BFA - the state pension scheme - which is demanding teachers now give over 20% of their income for a worthless pension. Also, don't forget you'll need health insurance, which can cost as much as your rent.</p> <p>4:30pm: Back on the bike to my next lesson with a group at a mortgage bank. From the meeting room you get a great view of the German Alps lying 100km to the south. Munich is a great centre for skiing and other sports. The banks of the Isar and the many parks are always full of joggers, rollerbladers, frisby and football players.</p> <p>7pm: Back home. This being a long winter evening, the recreational choices aren't so exciting - nights in or drinking with fellow expats in the many Irish bars around the town. Munich has loads of jazz cafes and eateries offering food from all over the globe, but unless you go with someone you may find yourself talking only to your Weissbier all night.</p> <p>Teaching in Munich can be a lonely business, but there are good opportunities for making money and the city and countryside are beautiful.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Panorama presenter John Ware has renewed his calls for the current affairs show to be moved from its graveyard Sunday night slot. He said the programme had lost up to 1m viewers since it was moved from Monday night last October and urged BBC director general Greg Dyke to return it to a weekday night. Mr Ware said the BBC's public service duty to inform and educate as well as entertain would not be fulfilled by documentaries about \"dinosaurs and hospitals\". He was speaking after he picked up yet another award for his investigation into the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland, in which he named those allegedly responsible for the atrocity. Who Bombed Omagh?, which was the last Panorama programme to go out on a Monday night, was praised as courageous. \"This courage is at odds with the BBC's decision to downgrade the importance of what was, and I would like to think still is, the corporation's flagship programme, by moving it from Monday to Sunday,\" Mr Ware said. \"This means we have lost 500,000 viewers.

We do not just fulfill that public service role with dinosaurs in primetimes and documentaries about how hospitals and prisons work. \"I hope the BBC will eventually change their mind about it although I am not sure they will,\" he added. Who Bombed Omagh? picked up a Royal Television Society award last month and was watched by 4.2m when it was broadcast last October. Following the move to Monday, ratings plummeted by 1m but BBC bosses have insisted they have no intention of moving the show back to a midweek slot. \u0095 Nick Clarke, presenter of Radio 4's World at One said he was \"thrilled\" to receive the BPG's award for best Radio Broadcaster of the Year. \"When you go to the Sony Awards you see there are awards for best breakfast show and best drivetime show but there are never any awards for best lunchtime programmes. \"It is an absolute thrill doing the show.

      "bodyText": "The NHS in Wales faces severe financial problems, with two-thirds of trusts in deficit, an auditor's report has revealed. The report, by the auditor general for Wales, says the health service was more than \u00a35m in the red for the last financial year, and predicts the deficit will more than double this year. Based on an in-depth assessment of the 1999-2000 NHS accounts, the report comes as separate audit commission information reveals big variations in performance across Welsh trusts, health authorities and local health groups - the equivalent of primary care groups in England. The auditor general says that last year, 10 out of the 15 NHS trusts in Wales were in deficit, and three - North East Wales, Carmarthenshire, and Cardiff and Vale - had debts that totalled more than \u00a31m each. There is still \"fundamental uncertainty\" surrounding Carmarthenshire trust's current and future financial position. The report highlights the need for the Welsh national assembly and the NHS directorate to monitor the recovery plans: \"It is essential that the assembly officials work with NHS Wales to improve the quality and timeliness of financial information, particularly in determining accurate forecasts of expenditure. This should go some way to enabling NHS Wales to manage its budgets more effectively.\" A spokesperson for Jane Hutt, the minister for health and social security, said the minister did not want to comment because the findings have yet to be debated by the assembly's own audit committee. A Picture of Health from the audit commission was based on a review of the operations of local health, health authorities and NHS trusts. It found significant variations in levels of performance. The report says that across the 15 trusts in the principality there is a wide variation in critical care bed capacity. It says there is a clear need for improvements to the way in which district nursing services are managed, resourced and delivered, and points out that district nurses in Wales see fewer patients proportionately than their colleagues in England. Another key area for attention is the improvement of services for diabetics, with more comprehensive annual checks and improved information being made available. The report calls for better coordination between health and social services with greater user involvement in service planning and a need to work across professional and organisational boundaries. Better leadership, it says, is likely to lead to a more focused service delivery. \"We found examples of good practice in parts of the services, particularly the improvements in waiting time in accident and emergency for elderly people with hip fractures, but the significant variations in performance need to be addressed,\" the report said.",

The telegenic Titchmarsh, who with co-presenter Charlie Dimmock made Ground Force one of the most watched programmes on the BBC, said he wants to \"give something back to the soil\". In his first interview since quitting the show, Titchmarsh said he saw his future in promoting organic gardening and instilling an interest in all things horticultural among children. \"It is time to move on and try different things and I am passionately committed to the idea of organic gardening,\" he said. \"I think of every little garden as part of a massive patchwork nature reserve, with every gardener doing their bit in the bigger scheme of things.\" Titchmarsh has put his name to a new range of organic plant foods. The proceeds of the products will go towards a fund he is setting up to finance garden projects in primary schools. Related story Mar 29: Titchmarsh quits Ground Force",

There wasn't another kick after he tucked the ball away - a really tidy finish, the type of goal I love to see strikers snaffle, close in but clean. </p> <p>But I don't think it was a coincidence that Cole perked up in the Albania game when Teddy Sheringham came on. He has always done well next to a link striker: a Peter Beardsley at Newcastle, a Sheringham or a Dwight Yorke at Manchester United.

He's a hell of a finisher, but as a solo striker he doesn't have enough physical presence to be effective. Ask him to fight for balls in the air and he'd be completely bypassed. I know they have been encouraging him to try to drop off a little bit deeper to pick the ball up and link with Cole, something he's tried very hard to do. But he's nowhere near as effective at that as he is when he operates in the predator's area. </p> <p>It might be time for the England coach to think about more natural combinations of his front men.

Against Finland he almost played as a right-back; I can understand the principle of trying to play with three strikers and carry the fight to the opposition, but we didn't do that. It's not a system that suits him at all. </p> <p>The alternative to the Liverpool connection is the Manchester United option.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stephen Sprouse is a humble man. Ask him about the calibre of people he has worked with (Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Debbie Harry) and he claims never to have realised that they are some of the most important image-makers of the 20th century. \"Yeah, I suppose so,\" says the 48-year-old designer and artist at his home in New York. \"I've never really thought about that.\" And so it is with similar lack of ego that Sprouse has collaborated with America's current style leader, Marc Jacobs, to create the must-have accessory of the season, the Louis Vuitton graffiti bag. </p> <p>Even though the bag is not officially on sale till April, the waiting lists at Louis Vuitton stores worldwide are so long that most shops have stopped taking orders. But this has not stopped the dedicated elite from calling branches around the world, desperate to snap up one of these instant classics. When a few of them made it to the Paris store, they instantly sold out. So when Louis Vuitton sent the bags as presents during the shows in France a couple of weeks ago, the lucky recipients were the envy of the entire fashion pack. </p> <p>The audacity of the bags, where Sprouse's trademark graffiti is slapped across the traditional LV monogram, shows the complete faith that Louis Vuitton must have in Jacobs. \"It seems like they really trust Marc,\" agrees Sprouse. \"It was totally his idea to do it.\" </p> <p>The pair met a year ago, after Jacobs decided to use graffiti as the next stage in his successful overhaul of the Vuitton brand, and worked on the collection in both Paris and New York. The bags may have been the most visible part of the collaboration, but Sprouse worked with Jacobs on other pieces for spring/summer 2001, including prints of roses and TV static, meticulously photographed, scanned and then consolidated with outlines from his thick marker pen. </p> <p>Sprouse, who arrived in New York from Indiana at the age of 16, is unique in fashion - someone who has survived without adhering to the seasonal cycle usually required by the fashion industry. But there is a good reason why he sits out the twice-yearly routine. \"I've never had a great business partner,\" he admits. \"I've got some leads. But I guess that's why I do art as well - you can be less of a part of a huge operation. I really admire Marc and the designers that do the collections. It's a major job. Nobody in the movies, nor recording artists, has got to put up with the same time schedules as fashion designers.\" </p> <p>So, although his ad hoc approach has meant that there is no Sprouse label, he seems to work best when jumping around between commitments.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Sprouse is a humble man. Ask him about the calibre of people he has worked with (Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Debbie Harry) and he claims never to have realised that they are some of the most important image-makers of the 20th century. \"Yeah, I suppose so,\" says the 48-year-old designer and artist at his home in New York. \"I've never really thought about that.\" And so it is with similar lack of ego that Sprouse has collaborated with America's current style leader, Marc Jacobs, to create the must-have accessory of the season, the Louis Vuitton graffiti bag. Even though the bag is not officially on sale till April, the waiting lists at Louis Vuitton stores worldwide are so long that most shops have stopped taking orders. But this has not stopped the dedicated elite from calling branches around the world, desperate to snap up one of these instant classics. When a few of them made it to the Paris store, they instantly sold out. So when Louis Vuitton sent the bags as presents during the shows in France a couple of weeks ago, the lucky recipients were the envy of the entire fashion pack. The audacity of the bags, where Sprouse's trademark graffiti is slapped across the traditional LV monogram, shows the complete faith that Louis Vuitton must have in Jacobs. \"It seems like they really trust Marc,\" agrees Sprouse. \"It was totally his idea to do it.\" The pair met a year ago, after Jacobs decided to use graffiti as the next stage in his successful overhaul of the Vuitton brand, and worked on the collection in both Paris and New York. The bags may have been the most visible part of the collaboration, but Sprouse worked with Jacobs on other pieces for spring/summer 2001, including prints of roses and TV static, meticulously photographed, scanned and then consolidated with outlines from his thick marker pen. Sprouse, who arrived in New York from Indiana at the age of 16, is unique in fashion - someone who has survived without adhering to the seasonal cycle usually required by the fashion industry. But there is a good reason why he sits out the twice-yearly routine. \"I've never had a great business partner,\" he admits. \"I've got some leads. But I guess that's why I do art as well - you can be less of a part of a huge operation. I really admire Marc and the designers that do the collections. It's a major job. Nobody in the movies, nor recording artists, has got to put up with the same time schedules as fashion designers.\" So, although his ad hoc approach has meant that there is no Sprouse label, he seems to work best when jumping around between commitments. And over the years this militantly freelance approach has enabled him to work on projects that would have been impossible if he had to design a new line twice a year. In the 70s, while also working as a drawing assistant for the designer Halston, he unwittingly created the look for one of rock's greatest icons, Debbie Harry. \"I moved into my friend's building in New York,\" he remembers. \"My friend also rented to Debbie, and Blondie used to rehearse in his front room.

Green Euro-MPs immediately called on consumers to boycott US oil companies. </p> <p>Margot Wallstrom, the EU's environment commissioner, said she was \"extremely concerned and disappointed\" and would fly to Washington next week to try to keep the US involved in the war against greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>Ms Wallstrom hinted at trouble if the US refused to attend talks due in Bonn in July. She stopped short of threatening to impose EU trade sanctions, but insisted that the US withdrawal from the treaty would distort fair transatlantic competition. </p> <p>\"Why should we put European businesses under such high pressure and let American companies off the hook,\" she said. \"Why should they play by other rules? </p> <p>\"The EU is willing to discuss details and problems - but not scrap the whole protocol.\" </p> <p>Richard Boucher, a US state department spokesman, said: \"Our current plan is to attend that Bonn meeting. So I would expect that we will be working on it before then.\" </p> <p>But neither Mr Boucher nor other state department officials would specify what shape the Bonn talks would take, and whether US delegates would insist on negotiating from scratch, without reference to the Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said he would express his concern at yesterday's White House meeting with Mr Bush. But at a press call before the meeting Mr Bush was unrepentant. </p> <p>\"We have an energy shortage. I look forward to explaining this today to the leader of Germany as to why I made the decision I made,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We'll be working with Germany. We'll be working with our allies to reduce greenhouse gases, but I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers.\" </p> <p>In London, Tony Blair - always vulnerable to EU criticism that he is too close to Washington - was said to want to \"engage constructively\" with the US and others to try to find a way forward. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"The prime minister is concerned because, obviously, he believes that climate change is a very serious problem which we need to tackle. </p> <p>\"He believes ... it is important that we reach an agreement to deal with a problem which is global. </p> <p>\"Obviously the next opportunity to do that will be in Bonn in July and I think he will then personally see President Bush at the G8 summit. But we believe that a way forward is still possible.\" </p> <p>EU member states regard Mr Bush's position on global warming as part of a pattern of US withdrawal from multilateral action, citing Washing ton's stance on landmines, the nuclear test ban treaty, UN dues, the international criminal court and other issues. </p> <p>The US is already at odds with the EU over the \"son of star wars\" national missile defence scheme, Nato and the European rapid reaction force, hormone-fed beef, genetically modified crops, and banana quotas. </p> <p>European officials had been encouraged by Mr Bush's campaign promise to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions. But he withdrew the promise earlier this month. </p> <p>So far none of the bigger European countries has ratified the Kyoto protocol. but the EU believes it is the best framework for tackling climate change. It will come into force only when it has been ratified by 55% of the industrialised countries which signed it. </p> <p>\"It is possible without the US but it is much more difficult,\" Ms Wallstrom said. \"Its about credibility and political will.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's decision is a particular blow to Sweden, which has made the environment one of the top priorities of its six-month tenure of the EU presidency. </p> <p>Last weekend's Stockholm summit warned Mr Bush to think again about Kyoto. </p> <p>In London, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said Mr Bush's announcement was \"exceptionally serious\", but he did not think sanctions against the US were the answer. </p> <p>\"The fact is, we do have a lot of leverage,\" he said. \"I certainly don't think we should despair or try to ostracise the US as a pariah.\" </p> <p>Japan and Pacific island states threatened by rising seas condemned the decision, and the Australian environment minister, Robert Hill, said: \"The Kyoto protocol wouldn't work without the United States.\" </p> <p>The European parliament's environment committee said in a statement: \"Europe must stand up to irresponsible US policies by rejecting them at the petrol pump. Unless the US rethinks its position, direct boycott is the only language they will understand.\"</p>",

The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said he would express his concern at yesterday's White House meeting with Mr Bush. But at a press call before the meeting Mr Bush was unrepentant. \"We have an energy shortage. I look forward to explaining this today to the leader of Germany as to why I made the decision I made,\" he said. \"We'll be working with Germany. We'll be working with our allies to reduce greenhouse gases, but I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers.\" In London, Tony Blair - always vulnerable to EU criticism that he is too close to Washington - was said to want to \"engage constructively\" with the US and others to try to find a way forward. A spokesman said: \"The prime minister is concerned because, obviously, he believes that climate change is a very serious problem which we need to tackle. \"He believes ... it is important that we reach an agreement to deal with a problem which is global. \"Obviously the next opportunity to do that will be in Bonn in July and I think he will then personally see President Bush at the G8 summit. But we believe that a way forward is still possible.\" EU member states regard Mr Bush's position on global warming as part of a pattern of US withdrawal from multilateral action, citing Washing ton's stance on landmines, the nuclear test ban treaty, UN dues, the international criminal court and other issues. The US is already at odds with the EU over the \"son of star wars\" national missile defence scheme, Nato and the European rapid reaction force, hormone-fed beef, genetically modified crops, and banana quotas. European officials had been encouraged by Mr Bush's campaign promise to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions. But he withdrew the promise earlier this month. So far none of the bigger European countries has ratified the Kyoto protocol. but the EU believes it is the best framework for tackling climate change. It will come into force only when it has been ratified by 55% of the industrialised countries which signed it. \"It is possible without the US but it is much more difficult,\" Ms Wallstrom said. \"Its about credibility and political will.\" Mr Bush's decision is a particular blow to Sweden, which has made the environment one of the top priorities of its six-month tenure of the EU presidency. Last weekend's Stockholm summit warned Mr Bush to think again about Kyoto. In London, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said Mr Bush's announcement was \"exceptionally serious\", but he did not think sanctions against the US were the answer. \"The fact is, we do have a lot of leverage,\" he said. \"I certainly don't think we should despair or try to ostracise the US as a pariah.\" Japan and Pacific island states threatened by rising seas condemned the decision, and the Australian environment minister, Robert Hill, said: \"The Kyoto protocol wouldn't work without the United States.\" The European parliament's environment committee said in a statement: \"Europe must stand up to irresponsible US policies by rejecting them at the petrol pump. Unless the US rethinks its position, direct boycott is the only language they will understand.\"",

      "bodyText": "Peter Salmon, the BBC's sports chief, is to focus on football and boxing in his efforts to expand the BBC's sports coverage. Two features of the weekend sports show Grandstand will be hived off into separate programmes to boost their profile and give BBC sports programmes a greater presence on electronic programme guides, the corporation announced today. The two shows, Football Focus and Football Final Score, will top and tail sporting events screened on Grandstand. At the same time, Grandstand is to receive an as-yet-undisclosed \"cash injection\" to allow it to buy up live sports rights and bolster its programming. And the BBC is to restructure the division into seven departments, each headed by a senior figure. Mr Salmon's deputy Niall Sloane will head up football and boxing; Gordon Turnbull has been confirmed as head of radio; Andrew Thompson will head up new media, sports news and development; and Dominic Coles will oversee rights negotiations. The department is to recruit a further three bosses to cover major events, programmes and planning, and general sports beyond football and boxing. Other areas Mr Salmon is keen to exploit include interactive media and partnerships with key rights holders in tennis, golf, rugby, racing, snooker and athletics. Earlier this month it emerged the BBC was close to securing the TV rights to England's autumn home rugby union internationals. This will be a certain morale booster to the battered sports department, which has suffered a series of devastating rights losses over the past few years. The restructure of the department is Mr Salmon's first major announcement since he took over the job last year. He will reveal further details of his strategy for the department in six weeks.

Speaking in a lecture at Hartlepool college, Mr Mandelson said: \"Some argue that there is no longer a regional problem in the UK - only a problem with areas of greater economic and social difficulties within regions. \"Certainly there are sharp differences in performance between communities within the north-east region. But the statistics show that a large performance gap between regions remains. \"London and the south-east is the richest region in the European Union, admittedly with its own pockets of poverty and social exclusion - but in every other part of the United Kingdom standards of living are below the European average.\" That view was strongly contested by the prime minister in a speech in December 1999, when he declared the economic gaps within regions were as great as those between them. On the potential role for elected regional authorities, Mr Mandelson said previously he was cautious about regional government - but his viewpoint had now changed. He believes elected authorities would have the democratic legitimacy to shape policy, would be sharply focused on regional needs, and could take responsibility for developing regional infrastructure.

      "body": "<p>The government is to delay a decision on a vaccination \"firebreak\" to try to control the spread of foot and mouth, Downing Street said today.</p> <p>A spokesman for the prime minister said that a decision on an inoculating livestock was now unlikely to be reached before Monday. Only yesterday, Downing Street said that a decision would be made within 48 hours whether to press ahead with a mass vaccination programme.</p> <p>Tony Blair, who today met farmers and local experts combating the outbreak in Dumfries, today also refused to indicate the likely date of the general election, saying his current priority was to concentrate on eradicating foot and mouth. \"I have nothing more to say on that than I have said before,\" he said during his visit to Dumfries and Galloway, where all but two of Scotland's 99 confirmed cases are located.</p> <p>\"My priority is to concentrate on making sure we get on top of, control, and eradicate this disease and making sure we get a decent future for farmers.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair was speaking after the Archbishop of York led senior Church of England clergy in urging the government not to hold the general election until the autumn because of the crisis.</p> <p>The Right Rev David Hope said there was a \"very strong feeling\" in the farming community that the election should not go ahead while many people would in effect be disenfranchised.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, also said \"serious thought\" should be given to the fact that movement was restricted in many parts of the country, but stopped short of calling for a delay.</p> <p>Meanwhile in London the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, met Ben Gill, the president of the National Farmers' Union and other farmers' leaders to press home the case for a vaccination cordon to halt the spread of foot and mouth.</p> <p>Mr Blair was joined by Scotland's first minister, Henry McLeish, the Scottish secretary, Helen Liddell, and the Scottish rural affairs minister Ross Finnie in his tour of Dumfries and Galloway.</p> <p>The group was also meeting representatives from the local council and the army fighting to control the disease.</p> <p>Yesterday the Tory leader, William Hague, visited Lockerbie, in the Borders, as the army started to dispose of thousands of carcasses in a mass burial site.</p> <p>Mr Hague told around 50 people at a meeting in Lockerbie that more needed to be done to speed up the cull and the payment of compensation and financial relief to businesses affected.</p> <p>South of the border in Cumbria, England's hardest hit county, an army spokesman said this morning that the disposal of animal carcasses at Great Orton airfield near Carlisle was progressing well.</p> <p>Major Guy Richardson said 50,000 animals had been buried at the site since the beginning of the week.</p> <p>An abattoir in Carlisle has just been reopened to assist in the cull of sheep, he said.</p> <p>In mid-Wales, 70 soldiers were deployed today to prepare the Ministry of Defence site for the burial of culled livestock.</p> <p>An army spokesman said civilian contractors had been brought in to start digging trenches and the soldiers were fencing off the site, at Epynt Mountain, on the Sennybridge firing range near Brecon.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br></p> <p><b>Audio

      "bodyText": "The government is to delay a decision on a vaccination \"firebreak\" to try to control the spread of foot and mouth, Downing Street said today. A spokesman for the prime minister said that a decision on an inoculating livestock was now unlikely to be reached before Monday. Only yesterday, Downing Street said that a decision would be made within 48 hours whether to press ahead with a mass vaccination programme. Tony Blair, who today met farmers and local experts combating the outbreak in Dumfries, today also refused to indicate the likely date of the general election, saying his current priority was to concentrate on eradicating foot and mouth. \"I have nothing more to say on that than I have said before,\" he said during his visit to Dumfries and Galloway, where all but two of Scotland's 99 confirmed cases are located. \"My priority is to concentrate on making sure we get on top of, control, and eradicate this disease and making sure we get a decent future for farmers.\" Mr Blair was speaking after the Archbishop of York led senior Church of England clergy in urging the government not to hold the general election until the autumn because of the crisis. The Right Rev David Hope said there was a \"very strong feeling\" in the farming community that the election should not go ahead while many people would in effect be disenfranchised. A spokesman for the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, also said \"serious thought\" should be given to the fact that movement was restricted in many parts of the country, but stopped short of calling for a delay. Meanwhile in London the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, met Ben Gill, the president of the National Farmers' Union and other farmers' leaders to press home the case for a vaccination cordon to halt the spread of foot and mouth. Mr Blair was joined by Scotland's first minister, Henry McLeish, the Scottish secretary, Helen Liddell, and the Scottish rural affairs minister Ross Finnie in his tour of Dumfries and Galloway. The group was also meeting representatives from the local council and the army fighting to control the disease. Yesterday the Tory leader, William Hague, visited Lockerbie, in the Borders, as the army started to dispose of thousands of carcasses in a mass burial site. Mr Hague told around 50 people at a meeting in Lockerbie that more needed to be done to speed up the cull and the payment of compensation and financial relief to businesses affected. South of the border in Cumbria, England's hardest hit county, an army spokesman said this morning that the disposal of animal carcasses at Great Orton airfield near Carlisle was progressing well. Major Guy Richardson said 50,000 animals had been buried at the site since the beginning of the week. An abattoir in Carlisle has just been reopened to assist in the cull of sheep, he said. In mid-Wales, 70 soldiers were deployed today to prepare the Ministry of Defence site for the burial of culled livestock. An army spokesman said civilian contractors had been brought in to start digging trenches and the soldiers were fencing off the site, at Epynt Mountain, on the Sennybridge firing range near Brecon.

      "body": "<p><strong>Baaba Maal</strong><br> Missing You (Mi Yeewnii) (Palm Pictures) <br>Rating: **** <br>\u00a313.99<br> </p> <p>It was just after midnight in London's Abbey Road Studios. In one room, the Manic Street Preachers were at work on Know Your Enemy. Up in the control room of Studio 2, a group of African musicians sat listening as guest percussionists from the Anglo-Latin band Sidestepper added the final dash of timbales and congas to what now promises to be the world-music album of the year. Song titles had been written on pieces of paper, which were shuffled around as decisions were made on the album's running order. A guitar line, recorded at a mobile studio out in a village in Senegal, burst from the speakers, followed by a flurry of notes from the kora (the west African harp), a clatter of percussion, and then the stirring, harsh-edged voice of the singer, who now sat motionless in a snakeskin jacket for the first playback of the new recordings. </p> <p>On that night, back in November, it seemed clear that Baaba Maal's new album was going to be something special, and the finished product is no disappointment. It marks a bold and gently exhilarating return to basics for a man who has rightly been credited as one of the great singer-songwriters of the continent, and whose last album, a somewhat frantic effort to appeal to the western pop market, matched the stirring playing of his band Daande Lenol against poor collaborations with the likes of the Screaming Orphans, and more interesting experimental work involving Brian Eno and Howie B. This time around, there are no electric guitars, no keyboards, synthesisers or horn section, and certainly no guest appearances by Western celebrities. </p> <p>Baaba Maal started off as an acoustic artist, working with his old friend Mansour Seck, with whom he recorded that gentle African classic Djam Leeli back in 1989. His more recent amplified shows have always included an acoustic segment. The new album is in some ways the long-awaited sequel to Djam Leeli, but here the acoustic songs are given a subtle, gutsy work-over by producer John Leckie, best known for his work with Radiohead. After recording the bulk of the album outdoors in a Senegalese village, Leckie said his aim had been to create an album that sounded \"epic but simple\". It's certainly atmospheric (though thankfully Leckie doesn't overdo those on-location sound effects), and it sounds like a gently intense live set, performed by master musicians. </p> <p>The album starts with Maal's stirring solo chanting, a reminder that he was brought up in the little town of Podor, on the edge of the desert, where African and Arabic styles collide. It then builds up as acoustic guitars, kora and backing choruses join in. Some of the songs, such as Miyaabele and the exquisite, lilting love song Jamma Jenngli, are simple and melodic, driven on by the fine playing of Kante Manfila, who joins Maal himself and Mansour Seck on acoustic guitar. Elsewhere are sections of what sounds like stuttering desert blues or passages of complex rhythmic music, with the kora joined by the sound of the balafon (the local xylophone), or the hoddu, the local name for the rasping desert lute, the ngoni. These are the ancients instruments that Baaba Maal would have heard when he started out, travelling across west Africa with Mansour Seck to study its music. </p> <p>It could be argued that he's not the only person to bring traditional instruments like these to a mass western market - they are used extensively by the young Malian singer Rokia Traore, the finest new female performer in Africa - but this is still a brave, confident move. That other Senegalese superstar, Youssou N'Dour, diluted his last, patchily brilliant album, Joko, by mixing African material with the now-predictable duets with Sting, Peter Gabriel or Wyclef Jean. Baaba Maal makes no such compromise here. This is an African acoustic classic - albeit with bright, classy western production values and a hint of Latin percussion - and it confirms his reputation as both songwriter and singer. The songs, performed as always in his native Fulani, are mostly personal, dealing with friendship, the changing role of African women, or his yearning for Podor. His voice is distinctive as ever, by turns intimate, passionate and rousing. </p> <p>Tonight, Baaba Maal is in Podor, giving his last local show before flying to Europe for a tour of acoustic shows in small venues across Britain during April and May, followed by a grand finale with his full Daande Lenol band at London's Royal Festival Hall in June. This promises to be the African-music event of the year.</p> <p>\u0095 To hear this album, call 09068 626828 and use code 1243*. To buy it, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Baaba Maal Missing You (Mi Yeewnii) (Palm Pictures) Rating: **** \u00a313.99 It was just after midnight in London's Abbey Road Studios. In one room, the Manic Street Preachers were at work on Know Your Enemy. Up in the control room of Studio 2, a group of African musicians sat listening as guest percussionists from the Anglo-Latin band Sidestepper added the final dash of timbales and congas to what now promises to be the world-music album of the year. Song titles had been written on pieces of paper, which were shuffled around as decisions were made on the album's running order. A guitar line, recorded at a mobile studio out in a village in Senegal, burst from the speakers, followed by a flurry of notes from the kora (the west African harp), a clatter of percussion, and then the stirring, harsh-edged voice of the singer, who now sat motionless in a snakeskin jacket for the first playback of the new recordings. On that night, back in November, it seemed clear that Baaba Maal's new album was going to be something special, and the finished product is no disappointment. It marks a bold and gently exhilarating return to basics for a man who has rightly been credited as one of the great singer-songwriters of the continent, and whose last album, a somewhat frantic effort to appeal to the western pop market, matched the stirring playing of his band Daande Lenol against poor collaborations with the likes of the Screaming Orphans, and more interesting experimental work involving Brian Eno and Howie B. This time around, there are no electric guitars, no keyboards, synthesisers or horn section, and certainly no guest appearances by Western celebrities. Baaba Maal started off as an acoustic artist, working with his old friend Mansour Seck, with whom he recorded that gentle African classic Djam Leeli back in 1989. His more recent amplified shows have always included an acoustic segment. The new album is in some ways the long-awaited sequel to Djam Leeli, but here the acoustic songs are given a subtle, gutsy work-over by producer John Leckie, best known for his work with Radiohead. After recording the bulk of the album outdoors in a Senegalese village, Leckie said his aim had been to create an album that sounded \"epic but simple\". It's certainly atmospheric (though thankfully Leckie doesn't overdo those on-location sound effects), and it sounds like a gently intense live set, performed by master musicians. The album starts with Maal's stirring solo chanting, a reminder that he was brought up in the little town of Podor, on the edge of the desert, where African and Arabic styles collide. It then builds up as acoustic guitars, kora and backing choruses join in. Some of the songs, such as Miyaabele and the exquisite, lilting love song Jamma Jenngli, are simple and melodic, driven on by the fine playing of Kante Manfila, who joins Maal himself and Mansour Seck on acoustic guitar. Elsewhere are sections of what sounds like stuttering desert blues or passages of complex rhythmic music, with the kora joined by the sound of the balafon (the local xylophone), or the hoddu, the local name for the rasping desert lute, the ngoni. These are the ancients instruments that Baaba Maal would have heard when he started out, travelling across west Africa with Mansour Seck to study its music. It could be argued that he's not the only person to bring traditional instruments like these to a mass western market - they are used extensively by the young Malian singer Rokia Traore, the finest new female performer in Africa - but this is still a brave, confident move. That other Senegalese superstar, Youssou N'Dour, diluted his last, patchily brilliant album, Joko, by mixing African material with the now-predictable duets with Sting, Peter Gabriel or Wyclef Jean. Baaba Maal makes no such compromise here. This is an African acoustic classic - albeit with bright, classy western production values and a hint of Latin percussion - and it confirms his reputation as both songwriter and singer. The songs, performed as always in his native Fulani, are mostly personal, dealing with friendship, the changing role of African women, or his yearning for Podor. His voice is distinctive as ever, by turns intimate, passionate and rousing. Tonight, Baaba Maal is in Podor, giving his last local show before flying to Europe for a tour of acoustic shows in small venues across Britain during April and May, followed by a grand finale with his full Daande Lenol band at London's Royal Festival Hall in June. This promises to be the African-music event of the year. \u0095 To hear this album, call 09068 626828 and use code 1243*. To buy it, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

      "bodyText": "A British adventurer today completed the first unaided row across the Pacific ocean, but only after being thrown overboard in rough seas and forced to swim the final 200 yards to dry land. Father-of-two Jim Shekhdar, from Northwood, west London, endured cyclones, shark attacks and dwindling food supplies as he battled more than 8,000 miles through treacherous waters on his journey from Peru to Australia. But, even with the Brisbane coastline in sight after 274 days alone at sea, the 54-year-old rower's ordeal was not over. Huge breakers swamped his 23ft vessel, tipping him into the water and forcing him to struggle through the surf to reach his goal. There, looking exhausted but delighted, he hugged his wife and downed a can of lager. Mr Shekhdar, who received a message of congratulations from the prime minister, Tony Blair, said the reception in Australia was \"absolutely amazing\". \"There were helicopters all over the place, people, kids, television, press, all sorts,\" he told BBC News. \"When I said it was what I was going to do nobody believed me so I thought I'd better do it. There's a lot more attention at the end than there was at the beginning.\" He said that during his trip he had struggled with several shark attacks, been hit by a fishing trawler and, most terrifying of all, narrowly avoiding being sunk by a tanker. It was a pleasant relief to be in human company again, he added. \"The first couple of months at sea were really good as it was nice to have some solitude. But eventually it gets a bit lonely out there,\" he said. The former England international water-polo player left Ilo in Peru on June 29 last year to embark on the Pacific Ocean Challenge 2000 in his tiny boat, Le Shark. The civil engineer and management consultant said that he had taken up the challenge because he knew the corporate lifestyle did not suit him and he wanted a new focus. A few days before his departure he told Kenneth Crutchlow of the Ocean Rowing Society: \"As far as I was concerned, the Pacific had never been rowed solo continent to continent and I wanted to be the first to do that.\" Mr Shekhdar cancelled an NHS hip-replacement operation weeks before he left Britain. Throughout the voyage he kept in contact with his family, friends and the Ocean Rowing Society via phone, fax and computer, and he was continually monitored using a tracking beacon. The challenge was not his first taste of ocean voyaging: he rowed the Atlantic with fellow adventurer David Jackson in 1997. Five-times Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave added his congratulations. \"I'm sticking to ponds, lakes and rivers,\" said Sir Steve after learning of the success.

      "bodyText": "A senior health official criticised by the Tories as a Labour sympathiser has been put in charge of the body tasked with taking the \"politics\" out of NHS board appointments. Sir William Wells has been appointed chairman of the new NHS appointments commission, which will choose chairmen and non-executives to sit on the boards of trusts and health authorities. The commission was set up as a means of removing the constant political wrangling over the 3,000 board positions, which have in the past been seen as partisan \"grace-and-favour\" nominations in the gift of the health secretary. Sir William, who is the non-executive chairman of the NHS south-east region, was earlier this month accused by Tory health spokesman Liam Fox of applying \"enormous and unnaceptable political pressure\" to NHS trusts. Sir William had sent a letter to trust chairmen in the south-east region in which he said he \"cannot over-emphasize the importance of achieving our manifesto commitment\" of reducing waiting lists. Dr Fox last night said Sir William's new role was \"simply unacceptable\" and \"made a mockery of any notion of impartiality in the NHS\". He added: \"It shows that willingness to comply with ministerial diktat is now best way to get on in the NHS.\" Sir William told SocietyGuardian.co.uk: \"I have never been a member of any political party in my entire life. I have been involved as a non-executive in the NHS under governments of all different colours.\" He described Dr Fox's comments as \"bizarre\" and pointed out that the shadow health secretary had \"never bothered to talk to me\" about his political sympathies. \"What Dr Fox forgets is that it was his party that appointed me as a regional chairman in the first place.\" Ironically, many in the health service believed Sir Wiliam to have been a Conservative sympathiser because of his track record as an enthusaistic proponent of the Tories' internal market NHS reforms in the early 1990s. Sir William attracted further controversy last week when it was alleged that he had \"delivered\" the resignation of a trust chair in the region to Alan Milburn before she had even made the decision to part company with the NHS. According to Health Service Journal, Sir Wiliam told Gillian Miscampbell, the chairwoman of Stoke Mandeville Hospital trust - and a Conservative councillor - to \"resign or be sacked\" over a waiting list scandal. Sir William has served as a non-executive board member in various NHS organisations continuously since 1968. He was appointed by then health secretary Kenneth Clarke as one of the 57 elite \"first wave\" of NHS trust chairmen in 1990 with the aim of taking forward the reforms. He was a founder member of the NHS Trust Federation, a body set up to champion the reforms, and was knighted in 1997 by former prime minister John Major. There was widespread surprise when he was not only retained as an NHS chairman by Labour, but became a trusted senior figure who became as enthusiastic a proponent of Labour \"modernisation\" as he was earlier of the Tory internal market. Roy Lilley, a former first wave trust chair and colleague of Sir William, said he had \"always found William's politics difficult to read\", and that he was often privately cynical about politicians. But he added that Sir William must have been seen as acceptable to the then Tory government to become a first wave trust chair: \"Everyone had some connection through the (Tory) central office network.\"",

Mr Brown's decision not to go for the leadership after Neil Kinnock's resignation prompted Mr Blair to think that his rival had had his chance and missed it - the book quotes an \"ally of Tony Blair\" as saying, \"Gordon bottled it.\" Mr Rentoul also claims that after John Smith's death, Gordon Brown did not decide to withdraw from the race to lead the Labour party at the infamous Granita dinner in Islington. Instead, the moment occurred at a dinner with Nick Brown and Charlie Whelan in a Covent Garden restaurant the night before. Tony Blair's relationship with Peter Mandelson is illustrated with a nice anecdote from the 1987 election campaign: at an early morning press conference, the then opposition Treasury spokesman Mr Blair described a policy of Mrs Thatcher's as \"the product of an unchecked and unbalanced mind.\" Peter Mandelson, at the time Labour's head of communications, rushed over to reporter Michael Brunson to assure him that Mr Blair did not mean that Mrs Thatcher was in fact mad. \u0095 Tony Blair: Prime Minister, by John Rentoul, is published by Little, Brown on April 5, at \u00a320.

      "body": "<p>When Ken Fero turned his camera on the funeral of Shiji Lapite, he had no idea where it would lead him. Seven years, and hundreds of hours of footage later, he has ended up with one of the most powerful and despairing films ever to have made in this country. </p> <p>Injustice is the simple title and complex subject of the film that closes the Human Rights Film Festival. Fero and Tariq Mehmood's feature documents deaths in custody - mainly black deaths - over a six-year period. It is not just the stories of Shiji Lapite and Brian Douglas and Ibrahima Sey and Joy Gardner, four innocents who died at the hands of police brutality. It is about the lives of the families they have left behind, and their thwarted struggle for justice.</p> <p>It was December 16 1994 when Shiji Lapite was stopped by two police officers for \"acting suspiciously\". Half an hour later he was dead. We see Shiji's wife wailing: \"They beat him to death. They killed him. Why should they kill him? Why? Why? Why?\" Each \"why\" is more gut-wrenching. The question never gets answered. The cause of death was asphyxia from compression of the neck consistent with the application of a neckhold.</p> <p>Four months after Shiji Lapite's death, on May 3 1995, 33-year-old Brian Douglas was on his way home when he was stopped by two police officers, PC Tuffy and PC Harrison. Brian was a big, handsome, popular man. \"It was hard not to like him,\" says his sister Brenda Weinberg. We see photos of him ironing his trousers and polishing his shoes, getting ready for a night out with his friends. Boy, he took such care of himself, says Brenda, he loved a good night out.</p> <p>Brian was with his friend Stafford when he was stopped. The officers ordered them out of the car and, apparently unprovoked, hit Brian on the head with a new US-style baton. The camera zooms in slowly on a terrible picture of Brian pierced by all kinds of tubes and instruments. After a few days, barely conscious, Brian asked his brother if he could come home. His brother held him down and hugged him.</p> <p>The humanity of Fero's film lies in the tiny details, the irrelevances. Brian's brother recalls how, even on his deathbed, Brian was allowed no peace: \"There was too much activity in the room. That bugged me, all the activity.\" We see Brian's mother arrive in London from Jamaica. Her son has died a few minutes before she reaches the hospital, and she is barking, literally barking, with grief. When she collects herself, she tells a gathered crowd, \"It's a very, very hard road to travel.\"</p> <p>As the campaigns build around these two deaths, we discover more and more deaths in custody. In December 1995 Wayne Douglas was arrested for suspected burglary. He collapsed and died while detained at Brixton police station. In March 1996 Gambian asylum seeker Ibrahima Sey was forced to the ground, sprayed repeatedly with CS gas, and then held face down for 15 minutes. When he went totally limp and stopped breathing, an ambulance was called. He was dead by the time they reached the hospital.</p> <p>Ken Fero says he is not interested in making objective films. He knew whose side he was on from the start. \"When we started investigating the cases, the facts were so clear that it was never a question of right and wrong, it was simply wrong, and a wrong that has been hidden.\" There are no interviews with police officers in the film. He says he would have happily interviewed the officers if he'd been allowed to.</p> <p>Fero, a former sculptor and painter, wears old-style pink Doc Martens and John Lennon glasses and a skinhead haircut. He began making films 15 years ago. He was frustrated by the people who came to see his art, felt they didn't bear much relation to the world he knew. He decided that film could be a more powerful and relevant medium - a political weapon.</p> <p>Fero was one of the founders of a collective called Migrant Media. He wanted his camera to document the everyday struggles of the communities he knew and lived with. If there was an angry exchange, a riot, a burnt car, a scrap on the streets, an unwelcome exchange of batons and bodies, his camera would be there to record it.</p> <p>Fero and his team of five have subsidised themselves over the seven years by making videos and doing odd jobs. He says that at the moment he can't see himself making another film because each one takes so much out of him. Not only has he been putting Injustice together, he has also been campaigning for the families involved. He says that is the only way he could have made the film - demonstrating to the families that first and foremost he was there as a friend and supporter, not just a reporter.</p> <p>Fero sees Injustice as a counter to the stories put out by the police about those who have died in custody. He talks about the common pattern he has observed with all the deaths in custody - never apologise, and blacken the victim's character. So Joy Gardner, who died after police stuck 13 feet of tape round her face while trying to restrain her, was always shown in a photograph as wild and uncontrollable. Fero shows pictures of her in her true light - a gorgeous, vibrant woman. In the film, even her irrepressible mother can't hold in her grief. She breaks down at a public meeting. \"I didn't believe human beings could be so cruel to each other. You don't know how much I cry. My tears will catch them,\" she says, talking of the officers who killed her daughter.</p> <p>We see how the police profiles of the victims were taken up by the mainstream press and history was soon revised. So Shiji Lapite was no longer described as a father of two or an asylum seeker. In the public eye he became a drug dealer after an undercover officer claimed he found crack cocaine at the incident. One officer told the inquest that Shiji was \"the biggest, strongest most violent black man\" he'd ever seen. In fact, he was five foot 10. PC McCullum admitted kicking him twice in the head as hard as he could, and said he was using reasonable force to subdue a violent prisoner. The coroner told the jury they could only deliver a verdict of unlawful killing if they were satisfied that the criminal offence of manslaughter had been committed. The unanimous verdict was unlawful killing, which is rare in death-in-custody cases. Yet, astonish ingly, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ruled that there was insufficent evidence to charge the officers with manslaughter.</p> <p>In August 1995, three months after the death of Brian Douglas, the family was finally allowed to bury him - without his brain. \"As far as I'm concerned, we've buried him with the essential bit missing,\" Brenda says through her bitter tears. We have already heard at the inquest PC Tuffy claiming that he hit Brian on the shoulder and the baton slid up. Several witnesses claim they saw him raise his arm and bring the baton down on his head. Medical experts testify that the impact was the equivalent of him falling 11 times his own height on his head. The Douglas family hope for an unlawful killing verdict but the inquest jury deliver a verdict of death by misadventure.</p> <p>It's October 1997, and the film's one moment of triumph. Family and friends of Ibrahima Sey celebrate the verdict of unlawful killing. Ibrahima's cousin says \"I stuck my fist in the air . . . he has gone, but not in vain.\" At last justice is within sight. But again the CPS ignored the inquest verdict and said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.</p> <p>S ince 1969, there have been 1,000 deaths in police custody in Britain. Only one of these deaths - David Oluywale, the first black man to die in custody - has resulted in an officer being convicted of a crime. Fero says there is still an establishment belief that the British police are the best in the world and that to acknowledge they are capable of, and sometimes guilty of, crimes would undermine the system. \"In France and America, you have police officers charged and convicted of manslaughter and murder. Here it doesn't happen. No matter how many people die, it seems they are not going to admit there is a problem.\"</p> <p>Fero hopes Injustice will challenge the contemporary notion of what constitutes a British film. \"People in America look at Britain and think of Four Weddings and a Funeral, with its funny, quirky characters. Well, our film is the other side of it. Our film is about four funerals.\"</p> <p>Now he faces his next battle; to get the film shown on television or in cinemas. Channel 4, which has backed previous Migrant Media films, has refused to have anything to do with the production of Injustice. The question now is whether they will show it. Meanwhile, he refuses to cut the film to appease the lawyers of mainstream distributors - that, according to Fero, would be a betrayal of the families. But, he insists, whatever it takes, the film will get shown. \"We'll take it round the country ourselves if necessary and make sure it's seen by a millinon people.\"</p> <p>One of the most remarkable and moving aspects of Injustice is seeing how people change over time - physically, politically, spiritually. Every family starts out believing in the concept of justice, convinced that those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones will be punished. But as the years pass, they lose faith.</p> <p>Brenda Weinberg, Brian Douglas's sister, says: \"Brian's last words were 'sort it'. And that's what we're trying to do. Sort it.\" Back in 1996, Brenda was urging the angry crowds to stay calm on a demonstration. Now she's not so sure if she was right to. \"I can't grieve, I can't put Brian to rest ever if I know someone's walking around out there responsible for his death and they haven't been brought to justice. The only thing that does happen is that as the time gets longer it's any justice; it can be legal justice or street justice. I don't really care any more.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Human Rights Watch International Film Festival opens at the Ritzy Cinema, London SW2, tonight (info: 020-7733 2229). For details of screening times for all films visit <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/iff/london.html\">www.hrw.org/iff/london.html.</a></p> <p>\u0095 Injustice premieres at the Ritzy next Thursday.</p> <p> <strong>Just causes on film - Highlights from the Human Rights Film Festival</strong></p> <p> <strong> Terrorists in Retirement</strong> </p> <p>Director Mosco Boucault, narrated by Simone Signoret </p> <p>Seven elderly men in Paris, five Poles and two Romanians, tell their stories of life and death in the Resistance in Paris. Almost all were Jewish and had fled from anti-semitism to eke out a living, illegally, in France. Most were also from communist families. </p> <p>They were young, 16 and 17, when they volunteered for the underground circle which carried out extremely risky assassinations of German officers, throwing bombs into the restaurants they frequented, attacking their cars and barracks. Reliving those days of more than half a century ago, these modest old men have no regrets, except perhaps that they did not do enough, they did not kill enough Nazis. \"I'd willingly kill more Nazis today,\" says one. </p> <p>The centrepiece of the film is the execution in 1944 of 24 men from the Resistance group led by the Armenian poet Manouchian. This was the tragedy which has marked these survivors of the same heroic circle. This film created a scandal in France, where it was initially banned from television because of its shocking thesis that these foreign Jews were deliberately sacrificed by the French Communist party in a struggle for power, ahead of the end of the war, between the communists and General De Gaulle. The modern-day anti-communist historians of this theory come over as something of a contrast to these strong, old men who lost everything except their political convictions. </p> <p><strong> Lumumba</strong> </p> <p>Director Raoul Peck </p> <p>This is a true story, warns the voice-over as the film opens on a dead man being manhandled towards the destruction of his body in acid and fire. The dead man was Congo's first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, betrayed by the colonialists who had reluctantly granted independence to the country but who plotted to hold on to its riches through their proxies in the province of Katanga. </p> <p>\"I came 50 years too soon, what we wanted for the country others did not,\" says Lumumba in his last letter to his wife as the film ends on the same image of the dark night in Katanga where Belgians shot him after he had been beaten ruthlessly by his Congolese enemies. </p> <p>This exceptional film tells a dramatic story from nearly half a century ago which today could be mistaken for highly coloured fiction. But Peck has done history proud. He shows us the crude racism and arrogant double-dealing of the Belgians - which was one trigger for the chaos which engulfed the country; and the second which was Mobutu's move for power encouraged by the American ambassador. </p> <p>Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba is uncanny in his accuracy. Every gesture seems to come straight from the iconic old photographs of him in the brief glory days of independence, then in the horror of his humiliation. Don't miss it. </p> <p><strong> Jung, In the Land of the Mujahedden</strong> </p> <p>Directors Fabrizio Lazzaretti, Alberto Vendemmiati </p> <p>This is an Afghanistan few outsiders have seen, but after watching this film you'll never forget it. Immense horizons of snow-topped mountains hang over dust plains emptied by a 20-year war. Desperate fighters of the north talk of the Taliban as the creatures of Pakistan and the English, and want revenge for every child's hand and foot blown off by land mines. Women, beyond desperation, are reduced to begging through their tattered, all-enveloping chadors. \"Not even death wants the people of Afghanistan,\" says one. </p> <p>The dirt-poor frontline town of Charikar - near the site of one of the greatest art finds in the world, the exquisite Begram ivories from the first and second century AD - was to have a hospital built for mine victims by an Italian medical team. The Italian surgeon chose Afghanistan as \"a place where no one wants to go, it's censored from our consciousness\". The film-makers, introduced by a veteran journalist who knew the Mojahadeen leaders decades before, found that they had embarked on \"an excursion into human grief\". </p> <p>The team came back over three years and filmed an extraordinary achievement against that grief. Charikar was destroyed in a massive offensive which sent hundreds of thousands of refugees into the Panshir Valley. But against all the odds a hospital was built here in the valley, and, amid the unending stream of casualties, a team of Kurdish doctors and nurses have realised the Italian surgeon's dream of a community with the will to withstand the madness of this war.</p>",

She breaks down at a public meeting. \"I didn't believe human beings could be so cruel to each other. You don't know how much I cry. My tears will catch them,\" she says, talking of the officers who killed her daughter. We see how the police profiles of the victims were taken up by the mainstream press and history was soon revised. So Shiji Lapite was no longer described as a father of two or an asylum seeker. In the public eye he became a drug dealer after an undercover officer claimed he found crack cocaine at the incident. One officer told the inquest that Shiji was \"the biggest, strongest most violent black man\" he'd ever seen. In fact, he was five foot 10. PC McCullum admitted kicking him twice in the head as hard as he could, and said he was using reasonable force to subdue a violent prisoner. The coroner told the jury they could only deliver a verdict of unlawful killing if they were satisfied that the criminal offence of manslaughter had been committed. The unanimous verdict was unlawful killing, which is rare in death-in-custody cases. Yet, astonish ingly, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ruled that there was insufficent evidence to charge the officers with manslaughter. In August 1995, three months after the death of Brian Douglas, the family was finally allowed to bury him - without his brain. \"As far as I'm concerned, we've buried him with the essential bit missing,\" Brenda says through her bitter tears. We have already heard at the inquest PC Tuffy claiming that he hit Brian on the shoulder and the baton slid up. Several witnesses claim they saw him raise his arm and bring the baton down on his head. Medical experts testify that the impact was the equivalent of him falling 11 times his own height on his head. The Douglas family hope for an unlawful killing verdict but the inquest jury deliver a verdict of death by misadventure. It's October 1997, and the film's one moment of triumph. Family and friends of Ibrahima Sey celebrate the verdict of unlawful killing. Ibrahima's cousin says \"I stuck my fist in the air . . . he has gone, but not in vain.\" At last justice is within sight. But again the CPS ignored the inquest verdict and said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. S ince 1969, there have been 1,000 deaths in police custody in Britain. Only one of these deaths - David Oluywale, the first black man to die in custody - has resulted in an officer being convicted of a crime. Fero says there is still an establishment belief that the British police are the best in the world and that to acknowledge they are capable of, and sometimes guilty of, crimes would undermine the system. \"In France and America, you have police officers charged and convicted of manslaughter and murder. Here it doesn't happen. No matter how many people die, it seems they are not going to admit there is a problem.\" Fero hopes Injustice will challenge the contemporary notion of what constitutes a British film. \"People in America look at Britain and think of Four Weddings and a Funeral, with its funny, quirky characters. Well, our film is the other side of it. Our film is about four funerals.\" Now he faces his next battle; to get the film shown on television or in cinemas. Channel 4, which has backed previous Migrant Media films, has refused to have anything to do with the production of Injustice. The question now is whether they will show it. Meanwhile, he refuses to cut the film to appease the lawyers of mainstream distributors - that, according to Fero, would be a betrayal of the families. But, he insists, whatever it takes, the film will get shown. \"We'll take it round the country ourselves if necessary and make sure it's seen by a millinon people.\" One of the most remarkable and moving aspects of Injustice is seeing how people change over time - physically, politically, spiritually. Every family starts out believing in the concept of justice, convinced that those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones will be punished. But as the years pass, they lose faith. Brenda Weinberg, Brian Douglas's sister, says: \"Brian's last words were 'sort it'. And that's what we're trying to do. Sort it.\" Back in 1996, Brenda was urging the angry crowds to stay calm on a demonstration. Now she's not so sure if she was right to. \"I can't grieve, I can't put Brian to rest ever if I know someone's walking around out there responsible for his death and they haven't been brought to justice. The only thing that does happen is that as the time gets longer it's any justice; it can be legal justice or street justice. I don't really care any more.\" \u0095 The Human Rights Watch International Film Festival opens at the Ritzy Cinema, London SW2, tonight (info: 020-7733 2229). For details of screening times for all films visit www.hrw.org/iff/london.html. \u0095 Injustice premieres at the Ritzy next Thursday. Just causes on film - Highlights from the Human Rights Film Festival Terrorists in Retirement Director Mosco Boucault, narrated by Simone Signoret Seven elderly men in Paris, five Poles and two Romanians, tell their stories of life and death in the Resistance in Paris. Almost all were Jewish and had fled from anti-semitism to eke out a living, illegally, in France. Most were also from communist families. They were young, 16 and 17, when they volunteered for the underground circle which carried out extremely risky assassinations of German officers, throwing bombs into the restaurants they frequented, attacking their cars and barracks. Reliving those days of more than half a century ago, these modest old men have no regrets, except perhaps that they did not do enough, they did not kill enough Nazis. \"I'd willingly kill more Nazis today,\" says one. The centrepiece of the film is the execution in 1944 of 24 men from the Resistance group led by the Armenian poet Manouchian. This was the tragedy which has marked these survivors of the same heroic circle. This film created a scandal in France, where it was initially banned from television because of its shocking thesis that these foreign Jews were deliberately sacrificed by the French Communist party in a struggle for power, ahead of the end of the war, between the communists and General De Gaulle. The modern-day anti-communist historians of this theory come over as something of a contrast to these strong, old men who lost everything except their political convictions. Lumumba Director Raoul Peck This is a true story, warns the voice-over as the film opens on a dead man being manhandled towards the destruction of his body in acid and fire. The dead man was Congo's first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, betrayed by the colonialists who had reluctantly granted independence to the country but who plotted to hold on to its riches through their proxies in the province of Katanga. \"I came 50 years too soon, what we wanted for the country others did not,\" says Lumumba in his last letter to his wife as the film ends on the same image of the dark night in Katanga where Belgians shot him after he had been beaten ruthlessly by his Congolese enemies. This exceptional film tells a dramatic story from nearly half a century ago which today could be mistaken for highly coloured fiction. But Peck has done history proud. He shows us the crude racism and arrogant double-dealing of the Belgians - which was one trigger for the chaos which engulfed the country; and the second which was Mobutu's move for power encouraged by the American ambassador. Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba is uncanny in his accuracy. Every gesture seems to come straight from the iconic old photographs of him in the brief glory days of independence, then in the horror of his humiliation. Don't miss it. Jung, In the Land of the Mujahedden Directors Fabrizio Lazzaretti, Alberto Vendemmiati This is an Afghanistan few outsiders have seen, but after watching this film you'll never forget it. Immense horizons of snow-topped mountains hang over dust plains emptied by a 20-year war. Desperate fighters of the north talk of the Taliban as the creatures of Pakistan and the English, and want revenge for every child's hand and foot blown off by land mines. Women, beyond desperation, are reduced to begging through their tattered, all-enveloping chadors. \"Not even death wants the people of Afghanistan,\" says one. The dirt-poor frontline town of Charikar - near the site of one of the greatest art finds in the world, the exquisite Begram ivories from the first and second century AD - was to have a hospital built for mine victims by an Italian medical team. The Italian surgeon chose Afghanistan as \"a place where no one wants to go, it's censored from our consciousness\". The film-makers, introduced by a veteran journalist who knew the Mojahadeen leaders decades before, found that they had embarked on \"an excursion into human grief\". The team came back over three years and filmed an extraordinary achievement against that grief. Charikar was destroyed in a massive offensive which sent hundreds of thousands of refugees into the Panshir Valley. But against all the odds a hospital was built here in the valley, and, amid the unending stream of casualties, a team of Kurdish doctors and nurses have realised the Italian surgeon's dream of a community with the will to withstand the madness of this war.",

      "bodyText": "The intervention of the Archbishop of York, Dr David Hope, into the government's deliberations over the putative date of the general election, by calling for the prime minister to delay naming the day until the autumn in order to conquer the foot and mouth crisis first, is an extremely rare intrusion these days. Bishops have tended to steer clear of controversy since the routine maulings that they used to receive from the Thatcher government in the 1980s, when the likes of Norman Tebbit routinely dismissed them as a bunch of lily-livered softies, wets and Marxists. The archbishop is certainly tapping into a vein of concern among Anglican clerics and divines - the bishop of Carlisle is reported to have locked himself up in his castle for the duration of the epidemic. Prayers have been said the length of the kingdom and synod meetings and jumble sales have been cancelled. There is understandably huge concern among farming parishes. But, although Dr Hope's seniority as second in the church hierarchy gives weight to his opinions, the evidence from church leaders seems to indicate that they are as divided as the rest of us. The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, had to be dragged in his wake to voice his concerns about the disease, though not the election date. The bishops of Oxford, Hereford and Salisbury - all rural dioceses, some with cases of foot and mouth - were today following the line that, as far as the election is concerned, if 'twere done, 'twere best got out of the way quickly on 3 May. Touring their flocks they have heard the farmers' fears - but also those of the tourist industry, with the desolate prospect of a visitor-less summer ahead. There is no doubt that Dr Hope identifies closely with his large rural province, which stretches from the Humber to the Scottish border, and with his diocese, which includes the lush, rustic Vale of York and the Dales. He - and they - have had a rough winter that, in the autumn saw the archbishop fishing about in his wellies at his residence, Bishopthorpe Palace, to salvage his wine cellar from the floods. It now appears, however, that the archbishop, who thought he was having a private lunch at the Times with the editor and Dame Thora Hird in preparation for that newspaper's Easter supplement, was taken aback to find his private words splashed all over the front page next day. With the Times's penchant for going down market these days it is perhaps a wonder that they did not splash on 90-year-old Dame Thora's opinions. He is surely right, though, to make his views known. As archbishop, he is known to be concerned that the church's current media strategy of keeping a low profile, dictated from Lambeth Palace, is having the effect of marginalising the Church of England in its role as a central pillar of national life. He can scarcely have thought, however, that his lunchtime chat would have such a galvanising effect.

      "bodyText": "BBC1's deathbed interview with the notorious gangster Reggie Kray did not prove popular with viewers, pulling in less than 5m last night. ITV enjoyed more success with its big interview - Tonight with Trevor McDonald's encounter with Paddington rail crash survivor Pam Warren drew the show's best audience for more than two months. The BBC was criticised for buying the exclusive final interview that formed the heart of Reggie Kray - the Final Word, which went out on BBC1 between 9pm and 10pm last night. The documentary had 4.8m viewers and a 21% audience share, according to unofficial overnights. It was up against ITV GP drama Peak Practice, which drew an audience of 8.2m. Last Thursday in the BBC1 9pm slot the Car Wars Special pulled in 5.2m viewers and had a 22% share. Later last night Sir Trevor interviewed Ms Warren - who has just discarded the plastic mask she wore for 18 months to protect her burned face - on Tonight. The programme drew 5.1m, which was a 32% share of the available audience between 10.20pm and 11.20pm. Last night's edition of Tonight was the most watched since it moved to the 10.20pm slot in late January. Some potential male viewers of the Kray documentary may have been tempted instead by Channel 5's 9pm movie, the John Travolta/Christian Slater action flick Broken Arrow. Channel 5's movie repeat had an impressive 2.9m viewers and a 14% share. Related story Mar 22: BBC in row over Kray film",

The inspectors did not have the moral courage to ruthlessly expose the City of London's lack of honesty. I think it is a cop-out,\" said Mr Bower.</p> <p>Investment bank Goldman Sachs and accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, now part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, were severely criticised in the report for their role in the seriously flawed flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1991.</p> <p>Mr Bower said he expected the Maxwell investigation to be closed, despite the fact no one had reached the bottom of the pensions scandal, which saw \u00a3450m disappear from Mirror Group pension funds.</p> <p>\"I think it is the end of the whole affair and it shows that nothing has changed in the 10 years since Maxwell died. Whitehall and the City are just as incompetent as they were back then,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Bower, who also wrote investigations into Richard Branson and Mohamed Al Fayed said the report, which heavily criticised Maxwell's sons and several City institutions, had not added to his substantial investigations into the Maxwell empire.</p> <p>\"You might as well rewrite what I have published.

      "bodyText": "Tom Bower, the investigative journalist who was the scourge of Robert Maxwell, has lashed out at the report into the late tycoon's business dealings. The author of Maxwell - the Final Verdict today said the DTI investigation lacked the \"moral courage\" to take the City of London to task over its role in Maxwell's affairs. \"It is a limited report. The inspectors did not have the moral courage to ruthlessly expose the City of London's lack of honesty. I think it is a cop-out,\" said Mr Bower. Investment bank Goldman Sachs and accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, now part of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, were severely criticised in the report for their role in the seriously flawed flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers in 1991. Mr Bower said he expected the Maxwell investigation to be closed, despite the fact no one had reached the bottom of the pensions scandal, which saw \u00a3450m disappear from Mirror Group pension funds. \"I think it is the end of the whole affair and it shows that nothing has changed in the 10 years since Maxwell died. Whitehall and the City are just as incompetent as they were back then,\" he added. Mr Bower, who also wrote investigations into Richard Branson and Mohamed Al Fayed said the report, which heavily criticised Maxwell's sons and several City institutions, had not added to his substantial investigations into the Maxwell empire. \"You might as well rewrite what I have published. It takes nothing forward. They must have had an unspoken agenda for the whole thing,\" he added.

No EU member state, least of all Britain, is talking about creating a \"European army\". British officials insist that any decision to deploy the RRF would be made by consensus. No EU member would be forced to participate in any operation.</p> <p>It is also inconceivable that the EU would plunge into a crisis without the support of Nato and the US, after the atlantic alliance is given \"first refusal\".</p> <p>It is the question of relations between the EU force and Nato that generates most anxiety - in both Brussels and Washington.</p> <p>British Conservatives were quick to protest that the appointment of a neutral like Mr Hagglund - Finland sat out the cold war - was a rebuff to the alliance. (Ireland, Austria and Sweden are the only other EU members who are not in Nato).</p> <p>And there was much wincing when the French chief of staff, General Jean-Pierre Kelche, insisted that Paris - always ambivalent about Nato - wanted the EU force to be independent, and operational by the end of the year.</p> <p>National balances - what insiders call the \"bums on seats factor\" - have to be carefully maintained. Klaus Schuwirth, a German general, heads the 50-strong military staff. Graham Messervy-Whiting, a British soldier with fluent French and a background in intelligence, is his deputy. Denmark has sent a dapper official to take charge of the situation room.</p> <p>Other member states are represented in key committees, where senior diplomats discuss what instructions to give the soldiers. All answer to Spain's Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo.</p> <p>Mr Solana's official title is \"High Representative and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers\". Translated from euro-speak, that means he works for the 15 governments, not the supranational European commission.</p> <p>And here is a problem. It makes no sense, some EU-watchers argue, to have Solana answering to national capitals, which often have their own agendas, while the union's massive foreign-aid budget - and the leverage it brings - is controlled by the commission, where Britain's Chris Patten is in charge of external relations.</p> <p>In the long run, argues Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a London-based thinktank, a single person should replace the high representative and the external relations commissioner to represent the union more coherently to the rest of the world.</p> <p>But for now, experts are more worried about the tanks, transport aircraft, satellites and other equipment that are needed if the EU is to have any divisions at all. The strongest impulse behind the whole project was the realisation of the yawning - and humiliating - gap between European and American capabilities in the 1999 Kosovo crisis, and in Bosnia before that.</p> <p>Americans still get far more bang for their buck. But European defence procurement is not moving as fast as the officers taking up their positions in the new institutions in Brussels.</p> <p>The crisis in Macedonia has been another sharp reminder of the need to develop the EU's military capabilities and reduce automatic dependence on Nato. \"If there was ever an argument for the RRF, Macedonia was it,\" Mr Patten observed at the Stockholm summit.</p> <p>The next big step comes in May, when the soldiers move out of the council \"bunker\", which Solana complained last year had as many holes as a Swiss cheese, and into specially converted, secure premises up the road. It will have dedicated computer systems for classified documents and proper guards to keep spies and terrorists at bay.</p> <p>Slowly but surely, Europe is starting to get used to the novelty. \"We are trying hard to help the union come to terms with the fact that there is a security and defence culture coming in,\" says one key figure. \"We have to get used to each other.\"</p> <p>But the generals do not want to rush things: \"We are lucky we have till 2003 to become fully operational,'' laughed Owe Wagermark, the Swedish airborne commander who sits on the military committee.</p> <p>\"We need time, and we all need to change.\"</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu\">European integration</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/\">Economic and monetary union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/\">European commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/\">European parliament</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28ian+black%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=ian+black&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Ian Black</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://ue.eu.int/en/summ.htm\" target=\"_new\">Council of the European Union</a><br> <a href=\" www.cer.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Centre for European Reform</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.europa.eu.int/index-en.htm\" target=\"_new\">EUROPA (European government home page)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr\" target=\"_new\">Le Monde</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lesoir.be/\" target=\"_new\">Le Soir</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/\" target=\"_new\">S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.elpais.es/\" target=\"_new\">El Pais</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/\" target=\"_new\">La Stampa</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aftonbladet.se/\" target=\"_new\">Aftonbladet</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/Links/0,3337,201049,00.html\">Euro links - Guardian Unlimited</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.euro-emu.co.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Emu net</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sysmod.com/emu.htm\" target=\"_new\">FAQ's on European issues</a><br><a href=\"http://www.spysmod.com/euro-web.htm\" target=\"_new\">More European links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sysmod.com/maneuris.htm\" target=\"_new\">IT and the Euro</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It is lunchtime in the centre of Brussels and eurocrats are sitting down to steak frites in the subsidised canteen of the EU council of ministers. Dark suits are the norm for male \"fonctionnaires\" (officials). It is, however, the military olive greens, blues and khakis that catch the eye, with the discreet flash of gold braid or a brightly coloured epaulette. Until last year, nothing more exciting or secret than fishing quotas and environmental standards was discussed in the pink stone 'bunker' that houses the council - where the union's 15 governments cooperate. Yet the gradual development of the EU's defence identity has brought scores of uniformed soldiers, sailors and airmen to the institutional heart of Europe to plan for future conflicts and crises. None of these well-tailored chaps are fighting men with mud on their boots, but rather armchair warriors waging the battles that need to be won before the EU can add some military muscle to the economic weight of its mighty single market and single currency. This week, another significant landmark was passed when the 15 chiefs of staff recommended their Finnish colleague, Gustav Hagglund, as the chairman of the EU military committee for the next three years. This will take him past the union's self-imposed deadline of 2003 for deploying a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force (RRF) on peacekeeping and humanitarian duties. Mr Hagglund - neat in grey with red flashes and an impressive array of medal ribbons - is a fit-looking 62-year-old who enjoys bear-hunting, and had flown to Brussels after a few days in Lappland, where it was a bracing minus 26. So exactly how did his committee fit into the complex \"spaghetti junction'' of interlocking bureaucracies? \"I'm just a simple general,\" he quipped, \"you'll have to ask the politicians\". Political sensitivities are immense. No EU member state, least of all Britain, is talking about creating a \"European army\". British officials insist that any decision to deploy the RRF would be made by consensus. No EU member would be forced to participate in any operation. It is also inconceivable that the EU would plunge into a crisis without the support of Nato and the US, after the atlantic alliance is given \"first refusal\". It is the question of relations between the EU force and Nato that generates most anxiety - in both Brussels and Washington. British Conservatives were quick to protest that the appointment of a neutral like Mr Hagglund - Finland sat out the cold war - was a rebuff to the alliance. (Ireland, Austria and Sweden are the only other EU members who are not in Nato). And there was much wincing when the French chief of staff, General Jean-Pierre Kelche, insisted that Paris - always ambivalent about Nato - wanted the EU force to be independent, and operational by the end of the year. National balances - what insiders call the \"bums on seats factor\" - have to be carefully maintained. Klaus Schuwirth, a German general, heads the 50-strong military staff. Graham Messervy-Whiting, a British soldier with fluent French and a background in intelligence, is his deputy. Denmark has sent a dapper official to take charge of the situation room. Other member states are represented in key committees, where senior diplomats discuss what instructions to give the soldiers. All answer to Spain's Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo. Mr Solana's official title is \"High Representative and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers\". Translated from euro-speak, that means he works for the 15 governments, not the supranational European commission. And here is a problem. It makes no sense, some EU-watchers argue, to have Solana answering to national capitals, which often have their own agendas, while the union's massive foreign-aid budget - and the leverage it brings - is controlled by the commission, where Britain's Chris Patten is in charge of external relations. In the long run, argues Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a London-based thinktank, a single person should replace the high representative and the external relations commissioner to represent the union more coherently to the rest of the world. But for now, experts are more worried about the tanks, transport aircraft, satellites and other equipment that are needed if the EU is to have any divisions at all. The strongest impulse behind the whole project was the realisation of the yawning - and humiliating - gap between European and American capabilities in the 1999 Kosovo crisis, and in Bosnia before that. Americans still get far more bang for their buck. But European defence procurement is not moving as fast as the officers taking up their positions in the new institutions in Brussels. The crisis in Macedonia has been another sharp reminder of the need to develop the EU's military capabilities and reduce automatic dependence on Nato. \"If there was ever an argument for the RRF, Macedonia was it,\" Mr Patten observed at the Stockholm summit. The next big step comes in May, when the soldiers move out of the council \"bunker\", which Solana complained last year had as many holes as a Swiss cheese, and into specially converted, secure premises up the road. It will have dedicated computer systems for classified documents and proper guards to keep spies and terrorists at bay. Slowly but surely, Europe is starting to get used to the novelty. \"We are trying hard to help the union come to terms with the fact that there is a security and defence culture coming in,\" says one key figure. \"We have to get used to each other.\" But the generals do not want to rush things: \"We are lucky we have till 2003 to become fully operational,'' laughed Owe Wagermark, the Swedish airborne commander who sits on the military committee. \"We need time, and we all need to change.\" Email ian.black@theguardian.com Related special reports European integration Economic and monetary union European commission European parliament Other articles More articles by Ian Black Useful links Council of the European Union Centre for European Reform EUROPA (European government home page) Le Monde Le Soir S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung El Pais La Stampa Aftonbladet Euro links - Guardian Unlimited Emu net FAQ's on European issues More European links IT and the Euro",

      "body": "<p>I was rather nervous meeting John Prescott for the first time. His car pulled up outside the TUC's Congress House headquarters during an \"awayday\" for the national executive committee on October 27 1998. It was lunchtime and I was standing outside the building with Tribune editor Mark Seddon and Sally Powell, who represented Labour councillors on the NEC.</p> <p>Prescott wandered over to us and started chatting amiably, asking how the morning had gone. Here was the deputy prime minister, gossiping informally! He was saying that he was late because he had been defending Labour MP Alan Meale, then his parliamentary private secretary. Two days previously, the papers had been full of stories about Meale lobbying ministers in Prescott's department over a planning inquiry on behalf of a wealthy Cypriot businessman.</p> <p>Prescott said jovially: \"We don't want to hang Alan Meale out to dry,\" and then, patting me on the arm and smiling, added: \"It's you that we want to hang out to dry!\" I was taken aback, but managed to stammer out \"Good to meet you, too, John\" in reply.</p> <p>After that encounter I was struck by the difference between Tony Blair and John Prescott on the NEC.</p> <p>Blair clearly found the national executive committee and the party machinery in general an irritating distraction. His introductory remarks were always fairly peremptory and he appeared to be on autopilot. When he replied, he gushed over the supportive questions and dismissed the difficult ones as quickly as possible. His aim seemed to be to moan about dissident Labour party members - and then to leave as soon as he decently could.</p> <p>Over the next two years, I was frequently surprised at how preoccupied Blair was with what he saw as \"ungrateful\" Labour party members rocking the boat, and how rarely he would actually engage with any of the political issues raised at the NEC.</p> <p>I also found myself struggling to make sense of some of his responses. He genuinely does speak in short, choppy sentences, often without verbs, and moves relentlessly from one non sequitur to another. Unusually for a lawyer, he seems uninterested in arguing his case. He took it for granted that the NEC was there to express appreciation - and seemed to regard it as a personal insult that some of us actually wanted to ask him questions.</p> <p>Prescott, on the other hand, would usually stay for the duration of the NEC and would engage in arguments. Unlike Blair, he spoke in clear, concise sentences and his point was always understandable. Contrary to his television and parliamentary image, he appears to choose his words with care.</p> <p>But he never uttered a word that deviated in the slightest from the New Labour message. During Blair's report, he would remain silent, nodding helpfully at certain key messages Blair was trying to deliver. Towards the end of of the questions to Blair, Prescott sometimes came in on subjects within his particular responsibility, such as transport. After Blair left the meetings, it was Prescott's job to put the government's or Millbank's line, which he did with total commitment.</p> <p>He came over to me as someone who had spent a lifetime operating in labour movement meetings. He has a more informal, blunt style than Blair and likes to sound down-to-earth, but he knows exactly what he is doing. At an NEC held a year later, he declared, \"I bloody hate PR,\" in what sounded like an off-the-cuff remark. When it found its way into all the newspapers the following day, I realised it had been pre-arranged and carefully calculated.</p> <p>Prescott is quick-witted, and utterly cynical. He is also well-briefed by Millbank, and will suddenly take out from his papers a public comment or newspaper article written by a member of the NEC and given to him by the Millbank press office.</p> <p>I have never seen a hint of the much-vaunted division between Prescott and Blair. Of course, the apparent New Labour, \"old Labour\" distinction between the men is useful for both of them, and for the New Labour project. Whenever New Labour is committed to a policy that appears unpalatable to ordinary Labour party members, such as cuts to benefits, or privatisation of public services, Prescott plays a useful role. He is able to use his \"old Labour\" image to suggest that the policy is really progressive, and deserves the party's support. He can sell the policies to constituencies that distrust Blair. In reality, however, Blair and Prescott are two sides of the same coin.</p> <p><b>Trouble with the press, a voting fiasco, and the union reps who kept quiet</b></p> <p><b> On last year's leaked Downing Street memos</b><br><br> When Blair arrived at the NEC in July 2000, he concentrated on his favourite themes: the press and the Tories. Unusually, the third theme, the perfidy of party members, was absent: \"The press have been giving us a hard time over the last few months.\"</p> <p>What Blair did not say, but many of us were thinking, was that the press had been giving him a hard time over the last few months - the widespread criticism of his suggestion that there should be on-the-spot fines for \"hooligans\", his son Euan's escapade, and leaked emails revealing how preoccupied he was with his public image. Dennis Skinner warned Blair: \"You need to be careful how you carry on in memos. Don't whinge, don't whine.\"</p> <p><b> On counting votes</b><br><br> Conference momentarily regained its old fire in 1999 when Barbara Castle was given a chance to speak on pensions. People were hanging on her every word and Millbank apparatchiks rushed around looking anxious when Brighton delegate Claire Wadey then explained her constituency was against the private finance initiative so would oppose the entire economic policy document. Veron Hince in the chair reminded conference it could not refer back part of the document and put it to the vote. Delegates, furious there was no specific vote on PFI, for once did not do as they were told and the vote was lost.</p> <p>Hince became agitated and called for a revote on the ground that delegates must have not understood the purpose of the first vote. So there was a second vote - and the document was again defeated. Suddenly, conference was growling. The next morning, Michael Cashman was chairing conference. His first announcement was that conference had been \"confused\" the previous afternoon and he was going to take another vote.Conference then went to a vote, and, of course, enough arms had been twisted the previous evening so this time the vote went according to the Millbank script. The document was approved.</p> <p><b> On Millbank and the unions</b><br><br> The trade union representatives were the only people at the national executive meetings with a real chance to challenge New Labour's agenda, and they could have made a difference if they had wanted to. Mary Turner (GMB) made her points about public sector work, Derek Hodgson (CWU) bristled over Post Office privatisation, Diana Holland (TGWU) raised employment rights and gender issues.</p> <p>Although their muted criticism rarely translated into votes or any follow-up action, their interventions were uncomfortable for Millbank. None of the other trade union representatives uttered so much as a whisper of protest at privatisation, cuts to public sector workers, the low level of the minimum wage, or the government's pensions policy.</p> <p>Yet nearly all of them represent unions opposed to privatisation, and in favour of an index-linked minimum wage and restoring the link between pensions and earnings. Their bargain with Millbank seemed to be that, provided Blair, Prescott and the others argued the government's case in a language of social justice, they would not press union policies at the NEC. For them, as for many others in New Labour, the height of political sophistication consists of saying what you don't believe in order to maintain some unquantifiable and virtually indiscernible \"influence\" over a leadership that holds you in contempt.</p> <p><b> On leaving the NEC</b><br><br> I went back early to London last year from the conference in Brighton on the train, happy to miss my very last opportunity to attend the NEC. It would be the annual ritual, with both the old and the new members present. I hoped I had avoided the indignity of being officially thanked by Blair for my work on the NEC, but three weeks later, a framed certificate arrived in the post.</p> <p>It was \"in recognition of service on the NEC\" and was signed by Blair and Margaret McDonagh [general secretary of the Labour party]. It was accompanied by a formal thank-you letter from McDonagh - the only letter I received from her (besides notices of meetings and documents) during my two years on the NEC. I've not yet decided what to do with the certificate.</p>",

In reality, however, Blair and Prescott are two sides of the same coin. Trouble with the press, a voting fiasco, and the union reps who kept quiet On last year's leaked Downing Street memos When Blair arrived at the NEC in July 2000, he concentrated on his favourite themes: the press and the Tories. Unusually, the third theme, the perfidy of party members, was absent: \"The press have been giving us a hard time over the last few months.\" What Blair did not say, but many of us were thinking, was that the press had been giving him a hard time over the last few months - the widespread criticism of his suggestion that there should be on-the-spot fines for \"hooligans\", his son Euan's escapade, and leaked emails revealing how preoccupied he was with his public image. Dennis Skinner warned Blair: \"You need to be careful how you carry on in memos. Don't whinge, don't whine.\" On counting votes Conference momentarily regained its old fire in 1999 when Barbara Castle was given a chance to speak on pensions. People were hanging on her every word and Millbank apparatchiks rushed around looking anxious when Brighton delegate Claire Wadey then explained her constituency was against the private finance initiative so would oppose the entire economic policy document. Veron Hince in the chair reminded conference it could not refer back part of the document and put it to the vote. Delegates, furious there was no specific vote on PFI, for once did not do as they were told and the vote was lost. Hince became agitated and called for a revote on the ground that delegates must have not understood the purpose of the first vote. So there was a second vote - and the document was again defeated. Suddenly, conference was growling. The next morning, Michael Cashman was chairing conference. His first announcement was that conference had been \"confused\" the previous afternoon and he was going to take another vote.Conference then went to a vote, and, of course, enough arms had been twisted the previous evening so this time the vote went according to the Millbank script. The document was approved. On Millbank and the unions The trade union representatives were the only people at the national executive meetings with a real chance to challenge New Labour's agenda, and they could have made a difference if they had wanted to. Mary Turner (GMB) made her points about public sector work, Derek Hodgson (CWU) bristled over Post Office privatisation, Diana Holland (TGWU) raised employment rights and gender issues. Although their muted criticism rarely translated into votes or any follow-up action, their interventions were uncomfortable for Millbank. None of the other trade union representatives uttered so much as a whisper of protest at privatisation, cuts to public sector workers, the low level of the minimum wage, or the government's pensions policy. Yet nearly all of them represent unions opposed to privatisation, and in favour of an index-linked minimum wage and restoring the link between pensions and earnings. Their bargain with Millbank seemed to be that, provided Blair, Prescott and the others argued the government's case in a language of social justice, they would not press union policies at the NEC. For them, as for many others in New Labour, the height of political sophistication consists of saying what you don't believe in order to maintain some unquantifiable and virtually indiscernible \"influence\" over a leadership that holds you in contempt. On leaving the NEC I went back early to London last year from the conference in Brighton on the train, happy to miss my very last opportunity to attend the NEC. It would be the annual ritual, with both the old and the new members present. I hoped I had avoided the indignity of being officially thanked by Blair for my work on the NEC, but three weeks later, a framed certificate arrived in the post. It was \"in recognition of service on the NEC\" and was signed by Blair and Margaret McDonagh [general secretary of the Labour party]. It was accompanied by a formal thank-you letter from McDonagh - the only letter I received from her (besides notices of meetings and documents) during my two years on the NEC. I've not yet decided what to do with the certificate.",

      "bodyText": "Big Breakfast producer Planet 24 has brought in a new executive producer to oversee the struggling show. Ben Rigden will take over from Richard Hopkins, who oversaw the revamp of the daily breakfast programme following the departure of presenters Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen in mid-January. Under Mr Hopkins a new five-strong presenting team of Melanie Sykes, Paul Tonkinson, Amanda Bryam, Donna Air and Richard Bacon was brought in and a new set introduced. But Big Breakfast's ratings are still in the doldrums at around 300,000 despite the changes introduced by Mr Hopkins. The change of personnel was not linked to any concerns about Big Breakfast's editorial direction or ratings, according to one insider. \"It's more about contract renewal than quitting or getting sacked,\" the source said. \"These guys tend to have six-month contracts with an option to renew. Richard just chose not to renew.\" Mr Hopkins had come to the Big Breakfast job straight from Big Brother. He worked on the revamp in a separate office before taking over as executive producer when Ed Forsdick stepped down on February 2. Mr Rigden, a Big Breakfast managing editor who has worked on the show on and off over the past four years, is not expected to make dramatic changes, but will build on the changes introduced by Mr Hopkins, according to the Big Breakfast insider. The revamp was designed to reposition the show to attract a slightly older, 16 to 17 year-old audience, rather than 14 and 15-year-olds. A Big Breakfast spokesman said there was no question of Channel 4 dropping the show. \"They could have axed it back in the days of Sharon Davies or Kelly Brook, but they've stuck with it.

Blair's pitch was rather loftier than that, but he was comfortable in advertising his belief in faith-based organisations helping to tackle social problems and in politicians promoting traditional family values. </p> <p>If the two leaders do compete for a putative religious vote, none will be more delighted than the evangelical Christians who, noting the influence of religious groups on American politics, believe that might be replicated here.

But some Christians cannot understand why, if Mr Blair and Mr Hague are so religiously committed, they do not insist on opposing abortion or embryo research. Nor can the leaders explain it to them as they stress the sincerity of their beliefs. </p> <p>But any lessons Christian activists derive from America founder on the differences of our societies and political systems. Even the most die-hard Conservative Christian backroom boys concede privately that privatisation of welfare services would not actually work, for all Mr Hague's wishful thinking. Mr Blair's view is more sophisticated: yesterday he talked of partnership between voluntary organisations and government agencies. </p> <p>The idea of handing over welfare provision even partially to religious charities would not only be unwelcome to the charities themselves but is also impractical. It has not even been outstandingly successful in Texas where they once passed children's homes to the likes of the Reverend Lester Roloff with his quaint Bible-based belief that his charges could survive on a diet of watermelon. </p> <p>Here the churches themselves need to sort out their approach to politics. It is when Mr Gidoomal suggests that Christian voters should apply their morality to the beliefs of various candidates that the lobby becomes distinctly confused.

Or how is a Christian to vote in Exeter, where the Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw, is a committed believer, son of a vicar, but gay? For the record, Mr Gidoomal suggests it might be possible to vote for a \"buffoon\" like Mr Forth, even though his views are bizarre, but that he could never vote for Mr Bradshaw, however otherwise attractive his policies might be. </p> <p>In the end such conundrums are ir-reconcilable, which is why most churches end up advising their members to vote for whoever they deem the best candidate, just like everyone else. </p> <p>But it does not answer the question why our political leaders want to wear their religious hearts on their sleeves. Perhaps they should recall John F Kennedy's dusty answer 40 years ago, when he reassured a congregation of Protestant churchmen in Houston, anxious about the prospect of having a Catholic president, that he would not be taking his orders from the Vatican.</p>",

For the record, Mr Gidoomal suggests it might be possible to vote for a \"buffoon\" like Mr Forth, even though his views are bizarre, but that he could never vote for Mr Bradshaw, however otherwise attractive his policies might be. In the end such conundrums are ir-reconcilable, which is why most churches end up advising their members to vote for whoever they deem the best candidate, just like everyone else. But it does not answer the question why our political leaders want to wear their religious hearts on their sleeves. Perhaps they should recall John F Kennedy's dusty answer 40 years ago, when he reassured a congregation of Protestant churchmen in Houston, anxious about the prospect of having a Catholic president, that he would not be taking his orders from the Vatican.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anti-abortionists in the United States have won the right to publish on the internet what amounts to a hit list of doctors who provide terminations for pregnant women. </p> <p>The site, known as the Nuremberg Files, describes abortions as \"Satan's food source\". It prints \"wanted\" posters of the \"baby butchers\" and in some cases lists their addresses, car licence plate numbers and relatives' names. Seven doctors providing abortions in the US have been murdered in the past ten years. </p> <p>The danger posed to doctors was underlined yesterday when one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives was arrested in France on suspicion of having murdered a gynaecologist in 1998. James Kopp, dubbed \"Atomic Dog\" by fellow anti-abortionists, was the subject of an international manhunt after Dr Barnett Slepian was shot dead at home near Buffalo, New York state. </p> <p>Within hours, Slepian's name was posted on the Nuremberg Files with a cross through it. </p> <p>The ruling upholding the right of the site to publish its content was upheld by a federal appeals court sitting in San Francisco. </p> <p>The decision aroused despair last night among pro-choice doctors and campaigners. Warren Hern of Boulder, Colorado - one of the doctors who lodged the original lawsuit in Oregon that went on to the appeal court - said he was \"shocked, disappointed and alarmed\" by the decision. Dr Hern, who has been the target of an attack, said the ruling would be a \"green light\" for the most violent anti-abortionists. </p> <p>Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, condemned the decision: \"Reasonable people understand the difference between free speech and harassment that creates a violent social climate.\" </p> <p>In making its ruling the bench pointed to the first amendment to the constitution, which guarantees free speech. One of the three judges said that \"extreme rhetoric and violent action\" had always played a part in American political life. </p> <p>The ruling arose out of a 1999 case in Portland, Oregon where a jury awarded $107m (then worth \u00a366.5m) in mainly punitive damages against the American Coalition of Life Activists, the Advocates for Life Ministries and 13 individuals who had put wanted posters of doctors on the web and described them as baby butchers. </p> <p>The case had been brought by four doctors, a clinic and the Planned Parenthood organisation under the Freedom of Access to Clinics Act. </p> <p>The identities of three of the seven doctors murdered in the past 10 years were listed on websites; there have been a further 17 attempted murders. Many such doctors now wear disguises and bullet-proof vests, live in fortified houses and vary their journeys to work. </p> <p>\"Political speech may not be punished just because it makes it more likely that someone will be harmed at some unknown time in the future by an unrelated third party,\" said Judge Alex Kozinski in the judgment. </p> <p>\"Extreme rhetoric and violent action have marked many political movements in American history. Patriots intimidated loyalists in both word and deed as they gathered support for American independence. John Brown and other abolitionists, convinced that God was on their side, committed murder in pursuit of their cause. </p> <p>\"In more modern times, the labour, anti-war, animal rights and environmental movements all have had their violent fringes,\" said Judge Kozinski, who was appointed under Ronald Reagan's presidency. </p> <p>\"As a result, much of what was said by non-violent participants acquired a tinge of menace ... If their (the websites') statements merely encouraged unrelated terrorists then their words are protected by the first amendment.\" </p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union agreed that the first amendment protected the right to protest against abortion, but argued that \"it doesn't protect the right to threaten abortion providers with harm\". </p> <p>The ruling delighted anti-abortion groups. \"Hallelujah!\" said Neal Horsley of Carrollton, Georgia who runs the Nuremberg Files site. </p> <p>Yesterday the site was posting new names of doctors, calling for fresh volunteers to carry out surveillance on doctors to protect \"God's little babies\". It also guided site visitors to the names of doctors killed. </p> <p>\"This is a reaffirmance of first amendment liberty,\" said Christopher Ferrara of the American Catholic Lawyers Association, an attorney in the case. \"The posters do not contain any threats and in comparison to what we see in other protest movements, they are rather tame.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anti-abortionists in the United States have won the right to publish on the internet what amounts to a hit list of doctors who provide terminations for pregnant women. The site, known as the Nuremberg Files, describes abortions as \"Satan's food source\". It prints \"wanted\" posters of the \"baby butchers\" and in some cases lists their addresses, car licence plate numbers and relatives' names. Seven doctors providing abortions in the US have been murdered in the past ten years. The danger posed to doctors was underlined yesterday when one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives was arrested in France on suspicion of having murdered a gynaecologist in 1998. James Kopp, dubbed \"Atomic Dog\" by fellow anti-abortionists, was the subject of an international manhunt after Dr Barnett Slepian was shot dead at home near Buffalo, New York state. Within hours, Slepian's name was posted on the Nuremberg Files with a cross through it. The ruling upholding the right of the site to publish its content was upheld by a federal appeals court sitting in San Francisco. The decision aroused despair last night among pro-choice doctors and campaigners. Warren Hern of Boulder, Colorado - one of the doctors who lodged the original lawsuit in Oregon that went on to the appeal court - said he was \"shocked, disappointed and alarmed\" by the decision. Dr Hern, who has been the target of an attack, said the ruling would be a \"green light\" for the most violent anti-abortionists. Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, condemned the decision: \"Reasonable people understand the difference between free speech and harassment that creates a violent social climate.\" In making its ruling the bench pointed to the first amendment to the constitution, which guarantees free speech. One of the three judges said that \"extreme rhetoric and violent action\" had always played a part in American political life. The ruling arose out of a 1999 case in Portland, Oregon where a jury awarded $107m (then worth \u00a366.5m) in mainly punitive damages against the American Coalition of Life Activists, the Advocates for Life Ministries and 13 individuals who had put wanted posters of doctors on the web and described them as baby butchers. The case had been brought by four doctors, a clinic and the Planned Parenthood organisation under the Freedom of Access to Clinics Act. The identities of three of the seven doctors murdered in the past 10 years were listed on websites; there have been a further 17 attempted murders. Many such doctors now wear disguises and bullet-proof vests, live in fortified houses and vary their journeys to work. \"Political speech may not be punished just because it makes it more likely that someone will be harmed at some unknown time in the future by an unrelated third party,\" said Judge Alex Kozinski in the judgment. \"Extreme rhetoric and violent action have marked many political movements in American history. Patriots intimidated loyalists in both word and deed as they gathered support for American independence. John Brown and other abolitionists, convinced that God was on their side, committed murder in pursuit of their cause. \"In more modern times, the labour, anti-war, animal rights and environmental movements all have had their violent fringes,\" said Judge Kozinski, who was appointed under Ronald Reagan's presidency. \"As a result, much of what was said by non-violent participants acquired a tinge of menace ... If their (the websites') statements merely encouraged unrelated terrorists then their words are protected by the first amendment.\" The American Civil Liberties Union agreed that the first amendment protected the right to protest against abortion, but argued that \"it doesn't protect the right to threaten abortion providers with harm\". The ruling delighted anti-abortion groups. \"Hallelujah!\" said Neal Horsley of Carrollton, Georgia who runs the Nuremberg Files site. Yesterday the site was posting new names of doctors, calling for fresh volunteers to carry out surveillance on doctors to protect \"God's little babies\". It also guided site visitors to the names of doctors killed. \"This is a reaffirmance of first amendment liberty,\" said Christopher Ferrara of the American Catholic Lawyers Association, an attorney in the case. \"The posters do not contain any threats and in comparison to what we see in other protest movements, they are rather tame.\"",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Maxwell, the son of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell, bears a \"heavy responsibility\" for many of the events leading to the collapse of the family's business empire, an official report said today. The Department of Trade and Industry report also said the Goldman Sachs merchant bank bears a \"substantial responsibility\" for allowing Robert Maxwell to manipulate the stock market. Several leading City institutions are criticised in the report, although the inspectors make it clear that the primary responsibility rests with the late tycoon himself. Goldman Sachs, the investment bank with which Robert Maxwell principally dealt when purchasing shares in his own companies, was found innocent of any wrongdoing by the criminal inquiry after Maxwell's death. The City accountancy firm then known as Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and other professional advisers involved with the flotation of Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers in 1991 were also criticised. The long-awaited conclusions of the inquiry into the Maxwell affair come nine years after the investigation was launched. The report was commissioned in 1992, seven months after Robert Maxwell toppled to his death from his luxury yacht in the Atlantic. His businesses toppled soon after, as administrators took over amid revelations that some \u00a3450m was missing from pension funds. The report makes several recommendations for ensuring that a similar collapse does not happen again. Among them is a recommendation for severe sanctions against companies that do not report fraud, and for the provision of more detailed guidance on the audit of business \"empires\".",

      "bodyText": "One of the world's most successful online news operations, WSJ.com, has shocked the troubled online content market by revealing it is about to lay off staff. The Wall Street Journal is one of the few newspapers to have made money out of its online operations and the decision to cut jobs surprised the industry. Its subscription-based news model is one of the most successful on the web. The online unit, which employs about 250 people, declined to give details of how many staff would be affected, aside from a vague promise the decision would only apply to \"a limited number\". The move is part of a cost-cutting campaign by Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal's parent. The job cuts are part of a move announced earlier this month to save Dow Jones \u00a340m over the next year by reducing the media giant's overall headcount of 8,500. The company has promised to give further details when it reports its first-quarter earnings on April 12. WSJ.com is the latest in a string of online media operations to slash jobs in a distressed online advertising market that can no longer sustain heavily staffed websites. But WSJ.com, one of the web's most successful subscription services, has long been the envy of internet content suppliers the world over. The internet service has 535,000 subscribers, who pay \u00a341 per year for the online service or \u00a320 if they already subscribe to the Wall Street Journal. While plans are afoot to trim the headcount at WSJ.com, Dow Jones insisted it would not scale back the size or depth of the operation. Elsewhere in the company, Dow Jones has delayed the launch of WeekendJournal.com, an online counterpart to a weekly leisure and entertainment section of The Wall Street Journal. It is also winding down Work.com, a site for small businesses.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Matthew Jay </strong> <br>Draw (Parlophone) <br>Rating: *** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p>The face that stares out from this debut CD is of a poster-pretty boy with fear in his eyes. And that just about sums up the music on Draw. Matthew Jay sings with a sadness barely obscured by the jaunty rhythms and clever use of samples and loops, using the eccentricity of his native South Wales to inform this snapshot of growing up. Held together by Jay's appealingly winsome voice are the breezy harmonica of Become Yourself, the odd uneasiness of Please Don't Send Me Away and the sublime You're Always Going Too Soon, a yearning to be reunited with a childhood friend, each song coated with a varnish of nostalgia and tears. The lyrics are contemporary - \"Talking to you now, is the easiest thing in all the fuckin' hell,\" Jay sings in Four Minute Rebellion - but there's an early-1970s feel about the harmonies and subtle guitar work, the calmness nicely distilling the knowingness. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Abraham </strong><br> On the Surface (JBO) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a310.99<br> </p> <p>Most singers lucky enough to have a voice like Rachel Cuming's would make sure it graced every part of their songs. But Cuming makes her soulful sounds - sultry, pleading and desperate - all the more special by applying them to her shuffling beats and rippling bass sparingly. When her voice trembles and hits high notes it's with restrained passion, rather than a mere show of ability. Thanks to Cuming's versatility, On the Surface is awash with influences and subtle nuances, embellishing hip-hop beats with electronica, taking old-school blues and adding some phat credibility. Come Live with Me allows Cuming to shine against an acoustic guitar until the beats break up the smoky atmosphere, but Surge works as an instrumental, a downbeat orchestral sample playing off against some jazz piano. The Answer, a cover of a 1973 song by Maxayn, is pure funk, life-affirming lyrics wrapped up in soundtrack atmosphere, strutting stylishly as Cuming's double-tracked vocals meet her own harmonies in a graceful groove. Brutally cool but completely lovable. (BC) </p> <p><strong> LeAnn Rimes </strong> <br>I Need You (London) <br>Rating: ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p>The press release for former country sweetheart LeAnn Rimes's second UK album makes hopeful comparisons with Britney Spears, but Celine Dion would be more apt. Rimes shares the Canadian blandstress's unerring instinct for unlikely-to-cause-insurrection stuff that only just passes for pop (as in youthful) music. In a sense, though, her strategy for crossing from the country market to a wider \"demographic\" has been dictated by her voice, whose innate glossiness makes it a natural vehicle for middle-aged fodder like the title track and a duet with Elton John, Written in the Stars (in which Reg sounds a good decade younger than his 18-year-old partner). By the same token, forays into dance music, such as the house mixes of Soon and the not-baddish number one single Can't Fight the Moonlight, are about as convincing as you'd expect. These are far outnumbered, however, by dribbly slowies such as Together, Forever, Always, which make the equally ballad-prone Westlife sound like Rage Against the Machine. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Manitoba </strong><br> Start Breaking My Heart (Leaf) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p>By day, Toronto resident Dan Snaith is a masters-qualified pure mathematician. By night, he arranges masters-quality electronic sounds. Start Breaking My Heart is innovative enough to suggest a mathmetician's thought-out, even formulaic approach, but once a framework is established, Snaith's emotions and creativity run riot. This is beautiful electronic music rooted in the pastoral grace of Boards of Canada, Eno, Aphex Twin's early ambience, naive 1980s electro and very early Kraftwerk, but with its own unique vision. Titles like James' Second Haircut and an atmosphere including playground noises, harps and music boxes come as close to childlike wonderment as any 22-year-old has a right to. Aided by Snaith's jazz and classical training - not to mention his tricky home computer and guitar - drumbeats skip, discordant saxes wail and pianos plink. But however avant-garde he gets, nothing is allowed to disturb the soothing mood. He is attracting plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic, and it's surely only a matter of time before a hardened A&amp;R bod is pleading with him to give up the day job. (DS) </p> <p><strong> Howe Gelb </strong><br> Confluence (Loose) <br>Rating: *** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p>One reliable indicator of an artist's merit is how they handle Can't Help Falling in Love. Ostensibly simple, it can be heartstopping (Elvis Presley); deep (U2); light on its feet (UB40); rambunctious (Lick the Tins) or just bonkers (the Stylistics). On his third solo album, Tucson's Howe Gelb has a most unusual crack at it. Backed by Grandaddy, Gelb croaks his way through it at a funereal pace that holds even during the wonky fadeout solo. Uniquely, it is Can't Help Falling in Love as acoustic death rattle, and with it Gelb has passed the test (although, since Gelb's band Giant Sand's finest moment remains the definitive attempt at Bob Dylan's Every Grain of Sand, the odds were loaded in his favour). Some of the remaining 16 self-penned tracks were recorded in Bristol with John Parish; and there will be no release more spartan this year. Gelb is a ghostly presence, mumbling his way through the sexually anxious Vex (Tucson), just about nailing the wispy instrumental Shadow of Where a River Was, or pulling tricks such as the French chatter throughout Vex (Paris). Too unyielding to elevate Gelb from his cult ghetto, Confluence remains evidence of a most fertile mind. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Violet Indiana </strong> <br>Roulette (Bella Union) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p>Had Cocteau Twins not so callously cluttered their music to claustrophobic, monotone effect, the commercial breakthrough they always seemed on the cusp of would surely have been theirs. Eight years after that trio's demise, chief Twin Robin Guthrie has learned his lesson and learned it well. Violet Indiana is Guthrie's collaboration with keeningly intelligent former Mono singer Siobhan De Mare, who walks softly but carries a big stick. She is a less hysterical, more sensuous singer than Cocteau Twin Liz Fraser, delivering distinctly adult lyrics with deadly calm. She is coruscating on Air Kissing (\"there's got to be more to you\") and Poison Gorgeous; unnervingly reminiscent of Minnie Riperton on Liar; and desolate on Little Echo's \"self destruction and seduction\" saga. Behind her, though, Guthrie has enrolled at the less-is-more school, twisting tones and flaunting melody to create an empathetic soundscape that harkens to Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks theme. It's exactly the foil De Mare's coiled venom needs in order to shine, and shine she does. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Various Artists </strong><br> Mersey Boys and Liverpool Girls: Sounds of the Mersey 1977-2001 (EMI) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p>Once a badge of local pride, the regional compilation has rather fallen into unlamented obscurity. Apropos of nothing, these 21 tracks celebrate Liverpool, while excluding Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Teardrop Explodes, Dead or Alive and the Yachts. It does, however, have a Beatle (Wings's pleasing but slight Deliver Your Children); the usual worthies (The Mighty Wah!'s barnstorming Heart as Big as Liverpool; Ian McNabb's daft-as-Ken-Dodd Liverpool Girl; the glorious pop of the Christians and the Lightning Seeds); and a clutch of upstarts worthy of carrying the torch for a scene that has been curiously moribund of late. Of the newer breed, Speed's Good Luck Charm is the most gorgeous duet since Tindersticks's Travelling Light; Ladytron's He Took Her to a Movie is ominous and sexually unconventional; while Steven Kennedy's Beautiful Land is part Mike Peters, part oompah band, but more engaging than such a combination promises. What, however, London-born Elvis Costello and his still splendid Oliver's Army are doing here, and why an album sub-titled Mersey Girls features only two female voices, must remain a secret to all but the compilers. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Chris Clark</strong> <br>Clarence Park (Warp) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a38.99<br> </p> <p>Chris Clark, a 21-year-old electronica prodigy from St Albans currently studying at Bristol University, apparently sent home-recorded demos to Warp, the home of Autechre and Aphex Twin, when he was just 13. A wayward boy (the demonic red-eyed kid on the album cover is him), his biography reads like a mini-history of, if not delinquency, then impishness: he bought a drum machine to spite his drum teacher; he used to divide up his emotions into percentages; he went missing and was found by his mum strumming a harp in a cave in Wales.. A triumph of micro-programming and mind-boggling editing, the self-produced Clarence Park is, as you might expect, playful in parts - the wistful synthesiser notes scattered throughout the almost conventionally lovely Lord of the Dance could be 1970s TV puppets the Clangers talking. But if Clark is tapping into childhood memories on this album of extremes, he doesn't spare us the dark stuff, from the blue moods of Pleen 1930s, with its sorrowful piano chords, to the nightmare visions of Shrewland. Clark, like labelmate Squarepusher, re-presents \"ambient\" not as muzak but as the brutal soundtrack of our lives - pneumatic drills, barking dogs, low-flying aircraft, the lot.</p>",

Start Breaking My Heart is innovative enough to suggest a mathmetician's thought-out, even formulaic approach, but once a framework is established, Snaith's emotions and creativity run riot. This is beautiful electronic music rooted in the pastoral grace of Boards of Canada, Eno, Aphex Twin's early ambience, naive 1980s electro and very early Kraftwerk, but with its own unique vision. Titles like James' Second Haircut and an atmosphere including playground noises, harps and music boxes come as close to childlike wonderment as any 22-year-old has a right to. Aided by Snaith's jazz and classical training - not to mention his tricky home computer and guitar - drumbeats skip, discordant saxes wail and pianos plink. But however avant-garde he gets, nothing is allowed to disturb the soothing mood. He is attracting plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic, and it's surely only a matter of time before a hardened A&amp;R bod is pleading with him to give up the day job. (DS) Howe Gelb Confluence (Loose) Rating: *** \u00a312.99 One reliable indicator of an artist's merit is how they handle Can't Help Falling in Love. Ostensibly simple, it can be heartstopping (Elvis Presley); deep (U2); light on its feet (UB40); rambunctious (Lick the Tins) or just bonkers (the Stylistics). On his third solo album, Tucson's Howe Gelb has a most unusual crack at it. Backed by Grandaddy, Gelb croaks his way through it at a funereal pace that holds even during the wonky fadeout solo. Uniquely, it is Can't Help Falling in Love as acoustic death rattle, and with it Gelb has passed the test (although, since Gelb's band Giant Sand's finest moment remains the definitive attempt at Bob Dylan's Every Grain of Sand, the odds were loaded in his favour). Some of the remaining 16 self-penned tracks were recorded in Bristol with John Parish; and there will be no release more spartan this year. Gelb is a ghostly presence, mumbling his way through the sexually anxious Vex (Tucson), just about nailing the wispy instrumental Shadow of Where a River Was, or pulling tricks such as the French chatter throughout Vex (Paris). Too unyielding to elevate Gelb from his cult ghetto, Confluence remains evidence of a most fertile mind. (JA) Violet Indiana Roulette (Bella Union) Rating: **** \u00a314.99 Had Cocteau Twins not so callously cluttered their music to claustrophobic, monotone effect, the commercial breakthrough they always seemed on the cusp of would surely have been theirs. Eight years after that trio's demise, chief Twin Robin Guthrie has learned his lesson and learned it well. Violet Indiana is Guthrie's collaboration with keeningly intelligent former Mono singer Siobhan De Mare, who walks softly but carries a big stick. She is a less hysterical, more sensuous singer than Cocteau Twin Liz Fraser, delivering distinctly adult lyrics with deadly calm. She is coruscating on Air Kissing (\"there's got to be more to you\") and Poison Gorgeous; unnervingly reminiscent of Minnie Riperton on Liar; and desolate on Little Echo's \"self destruction and seduction\" saga. Behind her, though, Guthrie has enrolled at the less-is-more school, twisting tones and flaunting melody to create an empathetic soundscape that harkens to Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks theme. It's exactly the foil De Mare's coiled venom needs in order to shine, and shine she does. (JA) Various Artists Mersey Boys and Liverpool Girls: Sounds of the Mersey 1977-2001 (EMI) Rating: **** \u00a315.99 Once a badge of local pride, the regional compilation has rather fallen into unlamented obscurity. Apropos of nothing, these 21 tracks celebrate Liverpool, while excluding Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Teardrop Explodes, Dead or Alive and the Yachts. It does, however, have a Beatle (Wings's pleasing but slight Deliver Your Children); the usual worthies (The Mighty Wah!'s barnstorming Heart as Big as Liverpool; Ian McNabb's daft-as-Ken-Dodd Liverpool Girl; the glorious pop of the Christians and the Lightning Seeds); and a clutch of upstarts worthy of carrying the torch for a scene that has been curiously moribund of late. Of the newer breed, Speed's Good Luck Charm is the most gorgeous duet since Tindersticks's Travelling Light; Ladytron's He Took Her to a Movie is ominous and sexually unconventional; while Steven Kennedy's Beautiful Land is part Mike Peters, part oompah band, but more engaging than such a combination promises. What, however, London-born Elvis Costello and his still splendid Oliver's Army are doing here, and why an album sub-titled Mersey Girls features only two female voices, must remain a secret to all but the compilers. (JA) Chris Clark Clarence Park (Warp) Rating: **** \u00a38.99 Chris Clark, a 21-year-old electronica prodigy from St Albans currently studying at Bristol University, apparently sent home-recorded demos to Warp, the home of Autechre and Aphex Twin, when he was just 13. A wayward boy (the demonic red-eyed kid on the album cover is him), his biography reads like a mini-history of, if not delinquency, then impishness: he bought a drum machine to spite his drum teacher; he used to divide up his emotions into percentages; he went missing and was found by his mum strumming a harp in a cave in Wales.. A triumph of micro-programming and mind-boggling editing, the self-produced Clarence Park is, as you might expect, playful in parts - the wistful synthesiser notes scattered throughout the almost conventionally lovely Lord of the Dance could be 1970s TV puppets the Clangers talking. But if Clark is tapping into childhood memories on this album of extremes, he doesn't spare us the dark stuff, from the blue moods of Pleen 1930s, with its sorrowful piano chords, to the nightmare visions of Shrewland. Clark, like labelmate Squarepusher, re-presents \"ambient\" not as muzak but as the brutal soundtrack of our lives - pneumatic drills, barking dogs, low-flying aircraft, the lot.",

Mark Russell is a composer/radio personality, James Young a musician/writer best known for Songs They Never Play on the Radio, one of the few books about rock'n'roll worth reading all the way through. Russell and Young interviewed most of the composers themselves, but the book opens with a superb essay by Mervyn Cooke about Bernard Herrmann - the film composer's film composer - who died in 1975, shortly after completing his Ellingtonian score for Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976). The interviewees include Danny Elfman (Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, Nightmare Before Christmas), Zbigniew Preisner (Three Colours Red), 007 innovator John Barry and Maurice Jarre (Witness, Laurence of Arabia), who reveals that he played theatre music for several years in a percussion duo with his compatriot Pierre Boulez. </p> <p>Many of the composers have a theatrical background: an experience of the excitement of spontaneous performance that still informs the way they work. Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Chinatown) had to write a weekly score for live TV drama: \"You had to be inventive and very fast. There was a lot of music to be written in the hour between the dress rehearsal and going on air.\" An accompanying CD, glued awkwardly to the front cover, contains a selection of well-known themes played mainly by the City of Prague Philharmonic. It's curious to hear Philip Glass's Vessels from Koyaanisqatsi without Michael Riesman's battery of Farfisa-like keyboards, and an over-literal reading of the swaggering Goldfinger theme demonstrates how hard it is to imitate Barry's signature Bond sound. The more \"classical\" scores (such as Elfman's Edward Scissorhands or Herrmann's Psycho) fare better, but the CD is there more as an aide memoire than a replication of the original soundtrack. Russell and Young's carefully edited interviews yield some fantastic insights and wisely avoid the name-dropping and anecdotes that too often spoil or trivialise film books. But the subject is ill served by the book's large format and eccentric, image-heavy design, which matches the six other books in RotoVision's Screencraft series. The handwritten scores by composers and orchestrators are a fascinating resource, but the whole package isn't quite sure whether it's a serious resource for students, musicians and cinema enthusiasts, or just another glossy coffee-table object for film fans, with full-bleed images of Johnny Depp, Janet Leigh and B\u00e9atrice Dalle. </p> <p><strong> Susan Alcorn</strong> <br>Uma (Loveletter Recordings/ Music Stuff) <br>Rating: *** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p>Based in Texas, Susan Alcorn is a pedal-steel guitar player with an articulate but left-field personal style on an instrument normally associated with country and western music. There are some jazz roots in her playing, demonstrated on this debut album by the inclusion of a melancholy Thelonious Monk/bebop medley, but the main sound is that of abstract free improvisation, with some of the space and introspection of Deep Listening Band, whose Pauline Oliveros is a supporter of Alcorn's. Alcorn also plays in the Ernest Tubb Memorial Band led by guitarist Eugene Chadbourne, who wrote that her work contains a deep threshold of emotion, \"the purity of which is a phenomenon unique to country music\". In Alcorn's hands the pedal steel is beautiful, glassy and liquid, however far she strays from pulse and conventional harmony. Her shifting chords and arpeggios are more like a pianist's than a guitarist's. Alcorn closes her long and challenging CD set with a familiar tune to send everyone home happy. It's a reharmonised waltz-time version of Amazing Grace, executed with a straight face. If she's not careful, an ad agency will snap it up it to accompany one of those sentimental scenes where rednecks and hip-hoppers embrace tearfully over tall glasses of stout. </p> <p><strong> Celloman</strong> <br>Aquador (SPI Music) <br>Rating: *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p>As a rock instrument, the cello has dangerous tendencies towards pomp, as the Finnish heavy-metal cello quartet (and breakfast TV stars) Apocalyptica demonstrate in their new single Path (Island). Celloman is the project name for the more modest Ivan Hussey, a musician who will always have a place in my heart for his moving performance on Clapham, King's Cross, Lockerbie, Zeebrugge, the apocalyptic Billy Jenkins piece \"for proper cello and two crap pianos\". Hussey is still a \"proper cellist\", but now has ambitions for clubland fame and acclaim. \"It's amazing that a cellist can sound so interesting and contemporary,\" was the alleged reaction of Kiss FM's Patrick Forge (who clearly doesn't get out much). </p> <p>The determinedly low-budget Aquador is a self-produced collection of largely instrumental tracks with a middle- eastern heart to the melodies and scales, played over a DJ-oriented throb programmed by Hussey himself. Percussionists such as Fedja Franklin and Gadi Seri, and several other guests, are mixed in to add interest and colour, and the whole confection sails along in a pleasant fashion. Beguiling patterns emerge from the multitracked cellos on tracks such as F Song and The Wailer. Hussey's arrangement of Chebba, a traditional Algerian song, is the sort of thing you can almost imagine being a freak holiday disco hit, like EBTG's Missing, New Order's Blue Monday or The Macarena.</p> <p>\u0095 To order any CD call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

The reasons are stamped all over his 11th album with the Bad Seeds: in the vehement, anguished, begging cries to God; the churning gothic atmosphere; the obsession with death and the histrionic sensitivity to portents; the mere presence of a song called Oh My Lord. For these people, Cave is the equivalent of those lonely souls in tattered jumpers who stand in exposed places like Leicester Square, barking into a crackly microphone that only Jesus can save us from damnation, being ignored by teenagers and tourists, shoppers and clubbers. Like them, he's humourless, doom-mongering and misguided - and he has weird clothes and a dodgy haircut to boot. </p> <p>No More Shall We Part isn't going to make born-again Cavians of them, but it's a magnificent reminder of just how wrong the nay-sayers and non-believers are. It's a majestic album, dramatic, propulsive, reeling with remarkable images, more resonant with every listen. Musically, the more muted songs (Sweetheart Come, Gates to the Garden) pick up where 1997's The Boatman's Call left off, but while that album's lyrics prickled with rejection and the raw hurt of relationships in splinters, this one radiates romance - perplexed and tentative to be sure, but more trusting of love and its possibilities. As on 1998's best-of compilation, these soft, sorrow-tinted songs alternate with violent tempests (Hallelujah), nightmare visions (Oh My Lord), bloody gashes of sound and fury more like the Cave of the 1980s. Each song, each style, is perfectly realised; Cave's two-decade career reaches its apotheosis here. </p> <p>That is, in no small part, down to the Bad Seeds: it's a pleasure to hear them return from their own bands and solo incarnations to create a sound more eloquent and hauntingly beautiful than ever before. In the music's ebb and surge, its contrasts of cacophony and calm, is a precise, restrained, mature orchestration that is utterly distinctive. The title song features nothing but Cave's smoky piano, his increasingly crooner-like voice and Thomas Wydler's gentle brush drums until the song's final quarter, when drums and bass rise up wrapped in velvety swathes of violins. </p> <p>Mick Harvey and Warren Ellis's string arrangements are exquisite throughout: they make Love Letter more yearning, The Sorrowful Wife more mysterious, Sweetheart Come more luxurious, with Ellis's violin softly serenading. On Oh My Lord, Ellis scrapes from his strings the fervent scrawl that makes his band Dirty Three sound so impassioned; that and Wydler's militaristic drumming drive the song into exhilarating chaos. Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow grows equally frantic, but it's the quieter sections that really impress, where you can appreciate the interplay of Harvey's guitar with Blixa Bargeld's, warm chords punctured by tiny, fierce slashes across the guitar strings. Here and on Hallelujah, Kate and Anna McGarrigle's girlish voices exude a faintly amused calm, and play brilliantly off Cave's vehemence. </p> <p>If the music ranks among the Bad Seeds' best, so too do Cave's lyrics. Much has been made in recent interviews of the fact that Cave wrote this album in an office, nine to five - the discipline sounds wholly uncharacteristic, but it has resulted in a set of songs that are striking, seductive and surprisingly entertaining, both to listen to and to read. Opening track and recent single As I Sat Sadly by Her Side is typical: the narrative - husband and wife sitting at the window, commenting on the world and God, a playful kitten leaping from lap to lap - is preposterous but absorbing, melancholy and strangely funny. </p> <p>These are lyrics that sock you in the stomach, only to come back later and tickle you in the ribs. As the gap between real and surreal widens in Oh My Lord, a twisting, deliciously odd sense of humour emerges, not least when Cave visits the hairdresser and \"a guy wearing plastic antlers presses his bum against the glass\". God Is in the House is more amusing still: its picture of a religious community that rejects \"goose-stepping 12-stepping teetotalitarianists\" and \"homos roaming the streets in packs / queer bashers with tyre-jacks / lesbian counter-attacks\" is relentlessly, almost lovingly detailed. Cave transforms the list into an artform on this album: a love letter is \"a plea, a petition, a kind of prayer\"; in a graveyard lie \"fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers, runaways and suicidal lovers\". The peak comes at the end in Darker with the Day, with the cutting words \"Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones / The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons and cunts\": one of pop music's more accurate descriptions of London society. </p> <p>But when the streets are paved with fools, that only makes the return home to the wife more welcome. Cave knows a few things about writing love songs - his wise, warm lecture on the subject proved as much - and here are some of his best. They are never simple: the image of the ring \"locked upon the finger\" in And No More Shall We Part has a sinister undertone; Love Letter is beset by storms, a hope that flickers beneath a \"sky ready to burst\"; and the relationship in The Sorrowful Wife, who sits \"counting the days on her fingers\", could not be more troubled. But Gates to the Garden, with its tender assessment of marriage (\"God is in this hand I hold\"), is a song to make the heart swell with affection, to make you run to a loved one and give them this wonderful album as a precious gift.</p> <p>\u0095 To hear this album, call 09068 626828 and use code 1244*.

Cave knows a few things about writing love songs - his wise, warm lecture on the subject proved as much - and here are some of his best. They are never simple: the image of the ring \"locked upon the finger\" in And No More Shall We Part has a sinister undertone; Love Letter is beset by storms, a hope that flickers beneath a \"sky ready to burst\"; and the relationship in The Sorrowful Wife, who sits \"counting the days on her fingers\", could not be more troubled. But Gates to the Garden, with its tender assessment of marriage (\"God is in this hand I hold\"), is a song to make the heart swell with affection, to make you run to a loved one and give them this wonderful album as a precious gift. \u0095 To hear this album, call 09068 626828 and use code 1244*.

It's effective if a bit overrated, but there's no denying a stupendous performance by Jamie Bell, just 15. To be this good as a novice actor would be impressive; to be this good as a dancer too seems miraculous. And it's the dancing scenes - especially one in the tight, claustrophobic brick surrounds that recalls East is East's exuberance - that stay with you, and more than cancel out some of the more sentimental views of northern life, as well as the uncertain plotting. It's set in Durham, 1984, a virtual war zone in the midst of the bitter miners' strike, and uses dance as an expression of frustration, something to lose yourself in, to hit back at the ugliness, strife and claustrophobia surrounding a young life.

From a promising start, Paul Verhoeven's film winds up with a pretty routine Old Dark House/ Alien plot: it's mad, bad Kev vs the world. But, plot be damned, the point of Hollow Man is its effects, and they are a spectacular entr\u00e9e into the world of blood, bones and tissue.

You can't help feeling body-meister David Cronenberg would have found better uses for all this technology, but where Verhoeven's superior predecessor, Starship Troopers, had no DVD extras at all, this uses the medium properly, explaining its conception in great detail and showing the frenetic Dutchman at work, acting out each part with abandon.

He was killed in a cycling accident, aged 44, in 1899, and his admirers have always claimed that French music lost one of its greatest composers tragically early. Others, however, have questioned whether his individual voice had fully emerged at the time of his death, while many have portrayed him as lurking somewhere between the post-Wagnerian chromatics of C\u00e9sar Franck and the impressionistic tonal fluidity of Debussy. </p> <p>Chausson also has the reputation - based on his orchestral works - of being one of music's great eroticists, though I'm afraid that anyone looking for graphic rumpy-pumpy in his songs, recorded complete for the first time, won't find it here. This is music that is sensuous rather than sensual, written around sex instead of portraying it. Desire is represented by its initial flickerings, or retrospectively seen from a point of enervated exhaustion once relationships are over and all passion is spent. </p> <p>Chausson's response to his texts is perhaps significant. Unlike Henri Duparc, he struggles when it comes to setting Baudelaire. There's nothing by his close friend Mallarm\u00e9, who so famously stalks Debussy's output. Despite his posthumous porno-reputation, Chausson was a happily married, devout Catholic, and all but one of his Verlaine songs use texts from the writer's late years, when religion rather than Rimbaud haunted his thoughts. Gautier's chiselled purity, the stagnant symbolism of Maeterlinck, and a clutch of now-forgotten writers drew from him much of his finest music. </p> <p>There are some shamefully neglected works here: La Caravane, a lengthy setting of Gautier that covers a colossal range of mood with the intensity of an operatic scena; the precise, syllabic, modal cool of H\u00e9b\u00e9, which pre-empts Satie more than any of the impressionists. There are also some weird versions of Shakespeare - Ophelia's mad scene, tonally meandering in its derangement, and a brilliant, bleak setting of Feste's final song from Twelfth Night. </p> <p>The accepted masterpieces continue to astonish, however: Le Temps des Lilas, which later formed the basis of the orchestral song cycle Po\u00e8me de l'Amour et de la Mer; and Serres Chaudes (\"Hothouses\"), which, eliding images of greenhouses and hospital wards, gives us a more oppressive view of Maeterlinck than Debussy's Pell\u00e9as does. Felicity Lott sings both works with aristocratic poise and a sensuous yet troubled refinement that is second to none. </p> <p>They form her only contribution to the set, however, for the bulk of the songs for female voice are taken by Ann Murray, who is less assured. There's a harshness of tone under pressure that gets in the way at times. She's at her best in the Chanson Perp\u00e9tuelle, where her soft singing is ravishing and the Chilingirian Quartet spins an exquisite web of sound around her. She shares the handful of duets not with Lott, but with the shallow-voiced Geraldine McGreevy, which was perhaps a mistake. </p> <p>The real find, however, is the American baritone Chris Pedro Trakas. His sound is consistently honeyed and sexy, and he has the ability to float soft high notes effortlessly. His way with words tells you that he understands French poetry as well as he understands French music. At the piano, Graham Johnson is immaculate, as always. Both in performance and content, the set is uneven - but the best of it will haunt you long after its final, beautiful chords have died away.</p> <p>\u0095 To order these CDs call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

On the more improvisational albums, such as Ruben Gonzalez's Chanchullo, he has revealed a Mingus influence in the way he holds together a jigsawed rhythm section, and his first album as a leader pushes this approach into uncharted territory, experimenting with reggae, R&amp;B and hip-hop flavours, and a wider instrumental palette, while still sounding entirely Cuban. </p> <p>The absence of a conventional drumkit is a liberating element, as the back-line of congas (Miguel \"Anga\" Diaz), timbales (Armadito Valdez) and bongos (Carlos Gonzalez) maintain an endlessly beguiling rhythmic lattice that still leaves space for the bass. </p> <p>Cachaito is also one of the funniest, most good-humoured albums to come along for a while. You can't help grinning when Conversacion gets going with the fiery flute-playing of Policarpo \"Polo\" Tamayo and Manuel Galban, \"the original Cuban surf guitarist\", who lets loose some nice Ventures-meet-Macro-Ribot Echoplex licks throughout the album. Another important sound is the Hammond of Jamaican organist Bigga Morrison, adding yet more spice to the steaming Cuban stew. </p> <p>Cachaito in Laboratory, as the title suggests, pushes the boat out further, with a beatbox, some scratching from French DJ Dee Nasty, a deliriously processed horn section and wiry stabs (Timmy Thomas style) from Morrison, capped by a blunt-scissors ending worthy of Prince. It is intriguing to hear how well the tone of the double bass adapts to contemporary, electric grooves - something Red Snapper, Hefner and others have attempted recently. </p> <p>Producer Nick Gold and engineers Jerry Boys and Simon Burwell have had a lot of fun with this album, whether playing with effects and dub echoes on numbers such as Tumbanga, which features the eloquent Hugh Masekela on flugelhorn, or just catching the moment with cuts such as the free-wheeling Anais (a name shared by Lopez's wife and his granddaughter). There are strings on three tracks, but they're not there to smooth out the sound, as are the orchestrations regularly spooned on to jazz albums. If anything, they make it all sound weirder, with a small, upfront section used sparsely on Israel Lopez's Redencion and scuttling pizzicato unisons on Oracion Lucumi. </p> <p>What will take Buena Vista fans by surprise is the album's self-indulgence, its freedom and its unfinished air. It is a young-sounding record: the product of someone getting a chance to make their first album at an unfeasibly old age, and getting away with murder. People used to make albums like this in the 1960s and 1970s, and even later on when people had money or free studio time to burn. But what Lopez and his team bring to this familiar party is a big dose of musicianship, and I suspect it will wear better than albums by his psychedelic forebears. </p> <p>Cachaito doesn't have the smooth classiness of Charlie Haden with Joe Lovano on that bassist's Cuban dinner-jazz album Nocturne (Verve). And it lacks the Starbucks-friendly tunefulness of Omara Portuondo or the original Ry Cooder-produced Buena Vista Social Club CD. It is not really jazz, and it's not \"world music\" - but it has the breezy spirit of a Sunday-afternoon jazz workshop blow from another planet.</p> <p>\u0095 Orlando \"Cachaito\" Lopez and band perform at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242) on April 14 at 7.30pm.</p> <p> \u0095 To listen to this CD call 09068 626 828 and use code 2089*.

It is not really jazz, and it's not \"world music\" - but it has the breezy spirit of a Sunday-afternoon jazz workshop blow from another planet. \u0095 Orlando \"Cachaito\" Lopez and band perform at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242) on April 14 at 7.30pm. \u0095 To listen to this CD call 09068 626 828 and use code 2089*.

This performance replaces the previous disc's austerity with an anguished intensity that builds to a climax of overwhelming despair. The choral singing is urgent and flawless, the soloists superlative. Christoph Pr\u00e9gardien is a forthright Evangelist, in marked contrast to Matthias Goerne's deeply human yet otherworldly Jesus. The arias, divided between eight singers rather than the usual four, are all beautifully done, though Dorothea R\u00f6schmann, Elisabeth von Magnus and Dietrich Henschel are particularly outstanding. I still prefer the tragic grandeur of Klemperer's 1962 EMI recording - but this is a noble, harrowing achievement that ranks among the finest recordings of the work. </p> <p><strong> Schumann: Cello Concerto/Works for Cello and Piano</strong> <br>Maisky/Argerich/Orpheus Chamber Orchestra (DG) <br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p>Cultish, tousle-haired cellist Mischa Maisky is lustrously eloquent in Schumann's gorgeous concerto, particularly in the slow movement, where he is expansive without ever once sliding into sentimentality. The playing from the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, however, is scrupulous rather than committed, while the work needs a richer orchestral string tone than they can muster. The disc's main focus falls on Maisky's collaboration with Argerich for the chamber works, though the problem here is that the most substantial piece, the 5 St\u00fccke im Volkston, isn't among Schumann's best and has a cloying cuteness that neither of them can disguise. The high points are the Op 70 Introduction and Allegro and Maisky's own transcription of part of the M\u00e4rchenbilder, originally written for viola. Here, we finally get both of them at their finest - fervent, rapturous and beautiful. </p> <p><strong>Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin</strong><br>Te Kanawa/Rosenshein/ Gedda/Hampson/Welsh National Opera Chorus and Orchestra/Mackerras (Chandos, 2 CDs)<br>Rating: **** <br> \u00a316.99<br> </p> <p>Eugene Onegin has always proved a difficult opera to get right on disc. Originally issued by EMI in 1994, this set, albeit uneven, is better than most. Thomas Hampson's Onegin is arrogant, elegant, sexy and at times deeply disturbing. Kiri Te Kanawa, in sumptuous voice as Tatiana, is more convincing as the self-assured aristocrat of the later scenes than she is earlier on, where some artfully contrived singing doesn't always convey the impulsiveness of teenage desire. Neil Rosenshein is an intense if effortful Lensky, and as a bonus you get the unmissable Nicolai Gedda as the best of all Monsieur Triquets. Charles Mackerras, unusually, takes a while to settle, and the opera's emotional ratchet doesn't start turning until the second act. The recording is sung in English, which is preferable to the Russian-on-auto-pilot approach that has marred many versions of the work. </p> <p><strong> Wagner: Das Rheingold</strong><br>Branzell/Maison/Schorr/ Habich/Metropolitan Opera Orchestra/Bodanzky (Naxos Historical, 2 CDs) <br>Rating: ***** <br>\u00a38.99<br> </p> <p>This is, quite simply, mind-blowing. Taped live in Boston during the Met's 1937 spring tour, it pairs Friedrich Schorr's Wotan - gloriously sung, noble, tragic and painfully self-deluded - with the unspeakably malignant Alberich of Eduard Habich. Neither performance has ever been bettered, though equally outstanding are Karin Branzell's Fricka - sexually manipulative rather than autocratic - and the great Belgian tenor Ren\u00e9 Maison as Loge, dangerously alluring and matchless in innuendo. The conductor, Artur Bodanzy, was controversial in his day, though his nervously urgent interpretation now seems years ahead of its time. Exhilarating, terrifying and savagely funny, the whole probes Rheingold's complex emotional and moral heart more completely than any other version I know. My only regret is that it doesn't form part of a complete Ring, since it was made at a time when the four operas were usually performed separately.</p> <p>\u0095 To order any CD call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Entertainment giant Disney is set to open the first Who Wants to be a Millionaire? theme park, taking the gameshow craze on to another level. The Hollywood giant, which operates the most successful theme parks in the world, is planning to open the attraction in Florida. Based at Disney's MGM studios, it will enable 600 visitors at a time to take part in a special 30-minute show. Disney has created a giant replica set with visitors playing for up to a million points which can then be converted into Disney prizes. As well as US visitors, the theme park is designed to appeal to UK holiday-makers, who flock to Florida in their millions every year. Disney-owned TV channel ABC has enjoyed spectacular success with the TV show format since buying it from UK production company Celador and is keen to exploit the concept further. Although US TV audiences for the show have fallen more recently, it still regularly pulls in more than 20 million viewers on ABC. Disney is looking at new ways of pulling in visitors to its parks in the face of falling consumer spending in the US. Earlier this week it announced 4,000 job cuts, 3% of its workforce. Complete Communications, parent of Celador and ultimate owner of the rights to Who Wants to be a Millionaire? has made a fortune from the concept. Over one billion viewers worldwide now watch a version of the show in 67 countries. Complete has already created a top-selling boardgame and a computer game format. In the autumn ITV will be launching the first interactive TV format on the ITV2 digital channel, which is expected to effectively launch interactive TV into the mass market.",

      "body": "<p>After 42 years underground, Ken Herdman at 74 is trapped on the ground floor of his small home in the former pit village of Seven Sisters up the Dulais Valley in south Wales.</p> <p>He talks fitfully through wheezes, gasping into his medication mask, another one hanging nearby from an oxygen cylinder, his wife hovering constantly in support. If he goes to the bathroom or moves to the dinner table he takes ages to recover from the effort.</p> <p>When I visited him I was in the happy position of bringing news of a substantial payment for his crippling bronchitis and emphysema. He is owed this because his former employer, British Coal, failed to protect him from dangerous, dusty conditions. Across Britain there are tens of thousands of other former miners suffering from lung disease or vibration white finger. And, like him many have waited a very long time for compensation. Many are still waiting.</p> <p>There are a quarter of a million claimants and the number has been rising at the rate of 1,000 a week, making this the biggest compensation claim in the history of Britain (and maybe the world). Over \u00a32bn has been set aside by the government - and this is not capped so it too could rise.</p> <p>On lung disease, progress has been desperately slow because the system of medical assessment to deliver fair payments is fiendishly complex. It was required to reflect the ruling by Mr Justice Turner in 1998 following a lengthy court action brought against the last Tory government and British Coal which had resisted the miners' claims for justice.</p> <p>Then followed an additional 18 months of legal wrangling. Every major improvement requires agreement between the department and solicitors on both sides whose legal fees could rise to \u00a3250m. For a long time there was an adversarial relationship between the government and the miners' solicitors but, fortunately, cooperation is now good.</p> <p>But it is important that the scheme is operated fairly. Taxpayers would demand nothing less. The non-smoker who has worked underground for 40 years deserves much more than the 40 cigarettes a day man who has worked below for just a year. So procedures are needed for accurate individual assessments.</p> <p>The compensation scheme has been bedevilled by other problems. Both solicitors and the medical assessment contractors, Healthcall, for various reasons failed to prioritise the oldest and sickest miners. Younger, fitter men have been processed first while others tragically died. There have been long delays and mix-ups between all the key players: also mix-ups by the claims handlers, IRISC. Solicitors have been swamped by the number of claims. The government has also made mistakes.</p> <p>A shortage of respiratory consultants has added to the delays. Their professional assessment includes checking pages of records on a CD-rom which for each individual can run to more than 800 pages.</p> <p>And the records are often hard to trace. Teams of Land-Rovers with scanners comb the countryside, calling at surgeries and hospitals. Sometimes notes go back decades in traditional doctors' scrawl. In the mining archives at Cannock there are 30 miles of files from long-closed pits, many not even indexed and just dumped after privatisation.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we have ensured that payments are now flowing more quickly, at the rate of \u00a31m daily, and soon to rise; \u00a3360m has been paid out so far, injecting huge spending into deprived coal communities - amounts like the \u00a3140,000 recently paid to a south Wales widow or \u00a3124,979 to a Valleys miner.</p> <p>But this is still not good enough. We recently cleared \u00a3400m to compensate former miners or their widows for the loss of pension entitlements because of early retirement due to illness. An additional \u00a330m has been set aside for \u00a32,000 interim payments to widows and between \u00a37,000 and \u00a314,000 to emphysema victims with asthma.</p> <p>I have also asked that the oldest and those most ill are given priority. Younger and fitter men finding that their appointments have been rescheduled, I am sure will agree that men in their 70s and 80s - who can hardly breathe or move and some who may die soon - should go ahead.</p> <p>We are streamlining the medical assessments. Now we not only have the capacity to do 1,000 per week but are also close to having the necessary resources in place too. This will double the rate we were achieving last year. But it will depend on finding enough doctors. I have appealed to respiratory consultants to come forward - out of retirement We have been opening new test centres.</p> <p>The medical assessors, the claims handlers, solicitors and government officials have all learnt painful lessons of implementing a scheme more than double the estimated size. Over the next three months a backlog of 1,000 medical assessments each week will be progressed for payment.</p> <p>We have a debt to pay to the men who worked in this country's coal mining industry and the widows who nursed them. We must all ensure they receive it.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hain is minister of state for energy</p>",

When I visited him I was in the happy position of bringing news of a substantial payment for his crippling bronchitis and emphysema. He is owed this because his former employer, British Coal, failed to protect him from dangerous, dusty conditions. Across Britain there are tens of thousands of other former miners suffering from lung disease or vibration white finger. And, like him many have waited a very long time for compensation. Many are still waiting. There are a quarter of a million claimants and the number has been rising at the rate of 1,000 a week, making this the biggest compensation claim in the history of Britain (and maybe the world). Over \u00a32bn has been set aside by the government - and this is not capped so it too could rise. On lung disease, progress has been desperately slow because the system of medical assessment to deliver fair payments is fiendishly complex. It was required to reflect the ruling by Mr Justice Turner in 1998 following a lengthy court action brought against the last Tory government and British Coal which had resisted the miners' claims for justice. Then followed an additional 18 months of legal wrangling. Every major improvement requires agreement between the department and solicitors on both sides whose legal fees could rise to \u00a3250m. For a long time there was an adversarial relationship between the government and the miners' solicitors but, fortunately, cooperation is now good. But it is important that the scheme is operated fairly. Taxpayers would demand nothing less. The non-smoker who has worked underground for 40 years deserves much more than the 40 cigarettes a day man who has worked below for just a year. So procedures are needed for accurate individual assessments. The compensation scheme has been bedevilled by other problems. Both solicitors and the medical assessment contractors, Healthcall, for various reasons failed to prioritise the oldest and sickest miners. Younger, fitter men have been processed first while others tragically died. There have been long delays and mix-ups between all the key players: also mix-ups by the claims handlers, IRISC. Solicitors have been swamped by the number of claims. The government has also made mistakes. A shortage of respiratory consultants has added to the delays. Their professional assessment includes checking pages of records on a CD-rom which for each individual can run to more than 800 pages. And the records are often hard to trace. Teams of Land-Rovers with scanners comb the countryside, calling at surgeries and hospitals. Sometimes notes go back decades in traditional doctors' scrawl. In the mining archives at Cannock there are 30 miles of files from long-closed pits, many not even indexed and just dumped after privatisation. Nevertheless, we have ensured that payments are now flowing more quickly, at the rate of \u00a31m daily, and soon to rise; \u00a3360m has been paid out so far, injecting huge spending into deprived coal communities - amounts like the \u00a3140,000 recently paid to a south Wales widow or \u00a3124,979 to a Valleys miner. But this is still not good enough. We recently cleared \u00a3400m to compensate former miners or their widows for the loss of pension entitlements because of early retirement due to illness. An additional \u00a330m has been set aside for \u00a32,000 interim payments to widows and between \u00a37,000 and \u00a314,000 to emphysema victims with asthma. I have also asked that the oldest and those most ill are given priority. Younger and fitter men finding that their appointments have been rescheduled, I am sure will agree that men in their 70s and 80s - who can hardly breathe or move and some who may die soon - should go ahead. We are streamlining the medical assessments. Now we not only have the capacity to do 1,000 per week but are also close to having the necessary resources in place too. This will double the rate we were achieving last year. But it will depend on finding enough doctors. I have appealed to respiratory consultants to come forward - out of retirement We have been opening new test centres. The medical assessors, the claims handlers, solicitors and government officials have all learnt painful lessons of implementing a scheme more than double the estimated size. Over the next three months a backlog of 1,000 medical assessments each week will be progressed for payment. We have a debt to pay to the men who worked in this country's coal mining industry and the widows who nursed them. We must all ensure they receive it. \u0095 Peter Hain is minister of state for energy",

The shadow chancellor brought the famous catch to his throat, which made him sound even more like Eeyore. \"I must say [stifled sob] that the chancellor is behaving disgracefully.\" Mr Portillo went on: \"The question will be tendentious and the funding will be rigged!\" As teenagers say these days, \"and your point is?\" Meanwhile the Tory awkward squad were having a wonderful time on the backbenches. They know they've had it, they wouldn't know what to do if by some miracle they did win, and they are determined to enjoy themselves in the meantime. Mr Brown was busy saying how important were his five economic tests for joining the euro. This is simply not true: the \"tests\" are one real measurement and four vague pieties. \"Con man!\" shouted John Bercow. The Speaker was on his feet in seconds. This was an unparliamentary term and Mr Bercow should withdraw. Mr Bercow offered a sarcastic, even insulting parody of an apology. \"Oh, readily, Mr Speaker! I will withdraw. Of course!\" His arms flailed around like an 18th-century French dancing teacher. Then he sank back into his seat and went into a great jokey, eye-rolling, search-me, what-was-all-that-about? routine for the benefit of the other MPs around him. I realised that he was turning into the Fonz from Happy Days, the Mister Cool at the back of the class whose peer prestige depends on not caring what authority figures think about him or anything else. I suppose that if the Tories have decided to treat the Speaker like a supply teacher in a south London comprehensive, then they probably aren't looking forward to a speedy return to government.",

The first and the last are pretty clearly indefensible: atheists have as strong grounds for their values as religious believers; if we are to declare nature sacrosanct, than we should ban doctors from curing patients.

Sweeping aside fears that he might appear to be running scared of an election, Mr Hague claimed that calling an election now would place \"party before country\".</p> <p>His intervention, during a visit to Cumbria, was the culmination of weeks of anguish over how to respond to the foot and mouth crisis. No grand Tory strategy was mapped out on day one because nobody knew how serious the disease would be. But the Hague strategy has gone through three distinct phases.</p> <p>When foot and mouth was first confirmed, Mr Hague instructed the shadow cabinet to adopt a bipartisan approach and to say nothing about postponing the election.</p> <p>As the number of cases increased, Mr Hague offered constructive criticisms of the government and raised doubts about holding the local elections on May 3.</p> <p>In the last two weeks, the gloves came off and Mr Hague launched stinging attacks on the government for failing to take hold of the crisis and for appearing to press ahead with elections.</p> <p>One shadow minister said that Mr Hague felt that it was important to adopt a bipartisan approach initially because the Tories would not be rewarded for scoring political points during a national crisis.</p> <p>As the crisis deepened, Mr Hague moved away from his bipartisan approach on March 13 when he used a visit to Cheltenham to call on the government to give a six month \"business rate holiday\" to all businesses hit by foot and mouth.</p> <p>During his Commons clash with the prime minister the following day, Mr Hague called for a policy of immediate slaughter and for the army's role to be stepped up.</p> <p>As speculation intensified about the election, Mr Hague used a visit to Cumbria on March 15 to raise his first doubts about election timing. In careful language, he warned that foot and mouth was having a \"devastating impact\".</p> <p>While the political truce had ended, open political warfare had yet to break out.</p> <p>At a press conference on March 20, Mr Hague said the government should introduce legislation to allow the county council elections to be postponed.</p> <p>Appearing on a platform stripped of Tory symbols, Mr Hague said: \"I don't think it would be right to call an election at a time when there is a national crisis out of control.\"</p> <p>It was at the end of last week, when an official epidemiological report forecast a possible 4,400 cases of foot and mouth by June, that Mr Hague lambasted the prime minister for mishandling the crisis.</p> <p>Mr Hague used a speech in Coventry to call on the prime minister to set up a \"crisis cabinet\" to deal with foot and mouth. He likened the crisis in the countryside to wartime Britain.</p> <p>Tory sources privately hope that foot and mouth will help them whenever the election is held. If Tony Blair opts for May 3, the Tories hope to win support from voters who share his view that an early election is inappropriate.</p> <p>If foot and mouth forces the prime minister to delay the election, Tories hope the expected downturn in the economy will pay dividends.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, however, the Tories' position in the polls remains as dire as ever.</p> <p><b>Email

      "bodyText": "William Hague is, for the first time since he took over as Tory leader, setting the political weather. Even his detractors admit that Mr Hague has judged his interventions on the foot and mouth crisis with great care, wrong-footing the government on numerous occasions. \"William's having a good war,\" said one Tory MP, not noted for his admiration of Mr Hague. The Tory leader managed to dominate early headlines yesterday when he finally called on Tony Blair to cancel plans for a general election on May 3. Sweeping aside fears that he might appear to be running scared of an election, Mr Hague claimed that calling an election now would place \"party before country\". His intervention, during a visit to Cumbria, was the culmination of weeks of anguish over how to respond to the foot and mouth crisis. No grand Tory strategy was mapped out on day one because nobody knew how serious the disease would be. But the Hague strategy has gone through three distinct phases. When foot and mouth was first confirmed, Mr Hague instructed the shadow cabinet to adopt a bipartisan approach and to say nothing about postponing the election. As the number of cases increased, Mr Hague offered constructive criticisms of the government and raised doubts about holding the local elections on May 3. In the last two weeks, the gloves came off and Mr Hague launched stinging attacks on the government for failing to take hold of the crisis and for appearing to press ahead with elections. One shadow minister said that Mr Hague felt that it was important to adopt a bipartisan approach initially because the Tories would not be rewarded for scoring political points during a national crisis. As the crisis deepened, Mr Hague moved away from his bipartisan approach on March 13 when he used a visit to Cheltenham to call on the government to give a six month \"business rate holiday\" to all businesses hit by foot and mouth. During his Commons clash with the prime minister the following day, Mr Hague called for a policy of immediate slaughter and for the army's role to be stepped up. As speculation intensified about the election, Mr Hague used a visit to Cumbria on March 15 to raise his first doubts about election timing. In careful language, he warned that foot and mouth was having a \"devastating impact\". While the political truce had ended, open political warfare had yet to break out. At a press conference on March 20, Mr Hague said the government should introduce legislation to allow the county council elections to be postponed. Appearing on a platform stripped of Tory symbols, Mr Hague said: \"I don't think it would be right to call an election at a time when there is a national crisis out of control.\" It was at the end of last week, when an official epidemiological report forecast a possible 4,400 cases of foot and mouth by June, that Mr Hague lambasted the prime minister for mishandling the crisis. Mr Hague used a speech in Coventry to call on the prime minister to set up a \"crisis cabinet\" to deal with foot and mouth. He likened the crisis in the countryside to wartime Britain. Tory sources privately hope that foot and mouth will help them whenever the election is held. If Tony Blair opts for May 3, the Tories hope to win support from voters who share his view that an early election is inappropriate. If foot and mouth forces the prime minister to delay the election, Tories hope the expected downturn in the economy will pay dividends. Against this backdrop, however, the Tories' position in the polls remains as dire as ever.

Ministers were reluctant to turn to what they have described as \"the last resort\", but with the slaughter toll now exceeding 500,000 (plus another 300,000 already authorised), they were finally forced this week to seek permission from the EU's standing veterinary committee. Permission to vaccinate 180,000 valuable dairy cattle in Cumbria and Devon was granted on Wednesday. British scientists, vets and farmers are all divided over the value of vaccination, but so far, ministers have pursued a united line with the farmers' national leaders. Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers Union, yesterday emphasised again the limitations of vaccination: not 100% effective, requiring repeated booster injections, involving a delay of several days before it begins to work. Yet he also plainly signalled for the first time that a targeted vaccination programme might have to be introduced.</p> <p>What is still missing is similar protection for sheep. Ministers were wrong to confine their application to cattle. True, a milking cow is worth about 10 times as much as a sheep, but this is to ignore the environmental contribution which sheep make to mountain, moor and dale. A government committed to assisting the tourist industry should not have ignored this fact. Earlier this week the National Trust director spoke of the devastation threatening the Lake District, where Herdwick sheep have developed a \"hefting\" instinct, under which fences are not necessary because individual flocks never roam from their patch. Without sheep, which have been there since the 12th century, today's picturesque grasslands would be turned into shabby scrub. Vaccination could be the only way of stopping the local outbreak spreading. Whole sheep breeds are threatened.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack's performance is \"woeful\" and the government should seriously consider taking it back into public ownership, according to a unanimous report from the Commons transport select committee published yesterday. The stern comments of the committee, chaired by Gwyneth Dunwoody, Labour MP for Crewe, come as the government is preparing to make a pre-election statement on Railtrack. It is expected to pledge more than an extra \u00a31bn but will attach tight strings. The report warns that the costs of Railtrack's mismanagement will finally land on the taxpayer. It states: \"It is unacceptable that the taxpayer should be compelled to bail out a private monopoly company which has acted so incompetently, without taking any stake in the company in return.\" The committee suggests the government could take a majority equity stake in the company and use it to exercise influence in the management and policies of Railtrack. The report says that the system of managing contractors on maintenance and renewal of the railway had been shown \"to have utterly failed\". It says that the regulation of Railtrack since privatisation has not been adequate. The actions of the regulator had for a long time been half-hearted and ineffectual, but had recently improved.",

The Department of Transport agreed that it was under an obligation to make a significant contribution to plans to make the railways safer after the Southall and Paddington disasters. Government sources said that there was no bar to the work starting and that some of the money could come from its \u00a360bn to improve the railways over the next decade. Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, backed an accelerated timetable for the introduction of an automatic train protection system under which drivers will eventually be directed by a central control. It will replace line signalling on all main routes. The radical safety shake up comes in a report produced by Lord Cullen, who presided over the inquiry into the 1999 Paddington rail crash in which 31 people died, and Professor John Uff, who chaired the inquiry into the 1997 Southall crash, which killed seven people. Both accidents were caused by trains going through red signals. Both would have been avoided if the trains had been fitted with a form of sophisticated automatic train protection. The industry is now working towards a new European train control system (ETCS). The first line to get it will be the London to Scotland west coast main route by 2005. In the meantime, the Uff-Cullen report has backed the fitting of the less safe and effective train protection warning system (TPWS) at a cost of \u00a3500m, borne mainly by Rail track. It should be installed by 2003. But the report underlined the problems associated with TPWS.

      "body": "<p>Thousands of older people in care homes and sheltered housing are being forced to pay to see an NHS doctor in flagrant breach of the principle that state medical services should be free, charities claimed last night.</p> <p>An investigation of 183 charitable homes found 34% were paying retainers of up to \u00a310,000 a year to get attention. Fees averaging \u00a341 a year for each resident were commonly introduced at the request of GPs who were already collecting \u00a345.05 from the NHS for each patient on their lists over the age of 75.</p> <p>In some cases the fee topped \u00a3150 a year and there were extra charges for basic services such as winter flu jabs, said a report by the Association of Charity Officers.</p> <p>Although the homes were meeting part of the cost from their charitable income, many were obliged to pass on charges to residents. The result was a breach of the principle that services should be provided according to need and free at the point of use.</p> <p>This week the government published a strategy to improve NHS services for older people and eliminate discrimination. At a press conference on Tuesday, John Hutton, the health minister responsible for social care, said he was not aware of older people being charged for primary care. \"If there is clear evidence ... bring it to my attention.\"</p> <p>Valerie Barrow, director of the Association of Charity Officers, said yesterday: \"This study clearly shows that some older people, because of where they live, are paying twice.\"</p> <p>Tessa Harding, head of policy at Help the Aged, said: \"It is outrageous that older people in residential and nursing homes are having to pay over the odds for something the rest of us get free. I cannot believe it is the government's intention that those who need healthcare most should have to pay.\"</p> <p>The report found \"damaging evidence of confusion over the definition of core NHS services\". While 80% of GPs provided free winter flu jabs for residents of care homes and sheltered housing, 20% listed the inoculation as a \"contracted\" service.</p> <p>About 10% of GPs conducted special surgeries in care homes at no extra cost, but 27% charged a retainer without offering on-site surgeries. \"The blurred definition of core NHS services means many older people in residential care homes are denied healthcare free at the point of need,\" the report said.</p> <p>The BMA said it had been asking the government for at least seven years to increase NHS cover for people in nursing homes.</p> <p>Andrew Dearden, chairman of the BMA's community care committee, said: \"General practitioners are left with few options. They could decide on no extra services at all. They could decide to supplement the NHS without any financial support or additional resources, but that would impact on the care of their other patients. A third option for GPs would be to say to the homes that they want to provide extra services as non-NHS services - and would the homes be willing to pay for them?\"</p> <p>The Department of Health said GPs were entitled to charge for services such as training staff. \"That is different from direct patient services. We will investigate any allegations of abuse,\" a spokesman said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of older people in care homes and sheltered housing are being forced to pay to see an NHS doctor in flagrant breach of the principle that state medical services should be free, charities claimed last night. An investigation of 183 charitable homes found 34% were paying retainers of up to \u00a310,000 a year to get attention. Fees averaging \u00a341 a year for each resident were commonly introduced at the request of GPs who were already collecting \u00a345.05 from the NHS for each patient on their lists over the age of 75. In some cases the fee topped \u00a3150 a year and there were extra charges for basic services such as winter flu jabs, said a report by the Association of Charity Officers. Although the homes were meeting part of the cost from their charitable income, many were obliged to pass on charges to residents. The result was a breach of the principle that services should be provided according to need and free at the point of use. This week the government published a strategy to improve NHS services for older people and eliminate discrimination. At a press conference on Tuesday, John Hutton, the health minister responsible for social care, said he was not aware of older people being charged for primary care. \"If there is clear evidence ... bring it to my attention.\" Valerie Barrow, director of the Association of Charity Officers, said yesterday: \"This study clearly shows that some older people, because of where they live, are paying twice.\" Tessa Harding, head of policy at Help the Aged, said: \"It is outrageous that older people in residential and nursing homes are having to pay over the odds for something the rest of us get free. I cannot believe it is the government's intention that those who need healthcare most should have to pay.\" The report found \"damaging evidence of confusion over the definition of core NHS services\". While 80% of GPs provided free winter flu jabs for residents of care homes and sheltered housing, 20% listed the inoculation as a \"contracted\" service. About 10% of GPs conducted special surgeries in care homes at no extra cost, but 27% charged a retainer without offering on-site surgeries. \"The blurred definition of core NHS services means many older people in residential care homes are denied healthcare free at the point of need,\" the report said. The BMA said it had been asking the government for at least seven years to increase NHS cover for people in nursing homes. Andrew Dearden, chairman of the BMA's community care committee, said: \"General practitioners are left with few options. They could decide on no extra services at all. They could decide to supplement the NHS without any financial support or additional resources, but that would impact on the care of their other patients. A third option for GPs would be to say to the homes that they want to provide extra services as non-NHS services - and would the homes be willing to pay for them?\" The Department of Health said GPs were entitled to charge for services such as training staff. \"That is different from direct patient services. We will investigate any allegations of abuse,\" a spokesman said.",

      "body": "<p>The government might be forced to bring in milk rationing within months unless it takes action now to vaccinate the entire national dairy herd against the spread of foot and mouth, a leading Labour peer warned yesterday. </p> <p>Many of Britain's dairy farms are close to the worst centres of the epidemic, in Devon, Cumbria and the West Midlands. Lord Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, warned that if the disease were to take hold on dairy farms, milk shortages were inevitable because fresh supplies cannot easily be imported. So far, more than 100 of Britain's 22,000 dairy herds have been marked for slaughter. </p> <p>\"The government should give serious consideration to vaccinating the entire dairy herd now,\" he said. \"If the government's worst-case scenarios are correct, there will be rationing within two months.\" </p> <p>The warning came as William Hague appealed for Tony Blair to \"put country before party\" and postpone the general election beyond May. It also emerged yesterday that the supply of drugs for the lethal injection of young animals that need to be culled are running out. </p> <p>A decision on whether to vaccinate cattle as part of the \"firebreak\" strategy is expected in the next few days. Britain won European Union permission this week to begin a limited vaccination programme but so far it is restricted to 180,000 dairy cattle in Cumbria and Devon. </p> <p>Vaccination would destroy the live export trade but Lord Haskins said it would be preferable to running short of milk. But he warned it would pose a new set of difficulties for the industry because once vaccinated, cows could still be disease reservoirs. \"You would have to ban the sale of unpasteurised milk because that could spread the virus,\" he said. \"This is nothing like as simple as people think it is.\" </p> <p>Implementing a programme of mass vaccination of dairy herds would mean accepting that foot and mouth is endemic in the UK. </p> <p>The National Farmers Union rejected Lord Haskins' fears that milk supplies could be disrupted. They said that so far, of the 14bn litres of milk Britain produces annually, just 100m litres have been lost because of the slaughter programme. \"At this stage it is too early to say that we are going to run short of milk,\" the NFU said. </p> <p>Half the annual milk quota is used for other dairy products and the NFU said this could be diverted to fresh milk if supplies ran short. </p> <p>Lord Haskins' warning is a blow to the government's hopes that it has the epidemic under control and can proceed with its plans for a May election. A majority of the cabinet wants May 3. And ministers and party officials who are urging an early election will argue that the threat of milk shortages illustrates that delay will only create further problems. </p> <p>Tony Blair will spend the weekend considering the options, with some MPs claiming that he feels uncomfortable at the prospect of campaigning while the animal slaughter mounts. He is also anxious about committing himself to fighting on two fronts, electoral and foot and mouth, at once. </p> <p>Though Labour backbenchers are divided the dominant view of senior ministers such as John Prescott and party officials at Millbank is to go now, even though they know the finely balanced judgment is Mr Blair's alone. Privately, one Tory ex-cabinet heavyweight said: \"He'd be mad to delay.\" </p> <p>The prime minister is expected to gather his closest political intimates, including Gordon Brown, Jonathan Powell, chief of staff, and Alastair Campbell, press secretary, at Chequers on Sunday to decide between May 3 and June 7 - the only real options. </p> <p>\"The word now is that Tony says he won't feel comfortable out there on the stump campaigning normally,\" one well-placed MP said. </p> <p>In his first interview on American television since the crisis broke Mr Blair told NBC: \"There is no reason why your average American tourist or one from any other part of the world cannot come here and have exactly the same holiday as they have always had.\" </p> <p>Millbank is poised to start the campaign next week, though slower than once planned. Mr Blair may stay in No 10 for most of the next two weeks, leaving Mr Brown to take the campaign lead. </p> <p>Mr Hague said: \"I wouldn't have an election at this point to date. That would be putting party before country. I would be concentrating on fighting this disease, not the election.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Ben Gill, NFU president, is live online at 10.30am today.

      "bodyText": "The government might be forced to bring in milk rationing within months unless it takes action now to vaccinate the entire national dairy herd against the spread of foot and mouth, a leading Labour peer warned yesterday. Many of Britain's dairy farms are close to the worst centres of the epidemic, in Devon, Cumbria and the West Midlands. Lord Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, warned that if the disease were to take hold on dairy farms, milk shortages were inevitable because fresh supplies cannot easily be imported. So far, more than 100 of Britain's 22,000 dairy herds have been marked for slaughter. \"The government should give serious consideration to vaccinating the entire dairy herd now,\" he said. \"If the government's worst-case scenarios are correct, there will be rationing within two months.\" The warning came as William Hague appealed for Tony Blair to \"put country before party\" and postpone the general election beyond May. It also emerged yesterday that the supply of drugs for the lethal injection of young animals that need to be culled are running out. A decision on whether to vaccinate cattle as part of the \"firebreak\" strategy is expected in the next few days. Britain won European Union permission this week to begin a limited vaccination programme but so far it is restricted to 180,000 dairy cattle in Cumbria and Devon. Vaccination would destroy the live export trade but Lord Haskins said it would be preferable to running short of milk. But he warned it would pose a new set of difficulties for the industry because once vaccinated, cows could still be disease reservoirs. \"You would have to ban the sale of unpasteurised milk because that could spread the virus,\" he said. \"This is nothing like as simple as people think it is.\" Implementing a programme of mass vaccination of dairy herds would mean accepting that foot and mouth is endemic in the UK. The National Farmers Union rejected Lord Haskins' fears that milk supplies could be disrupted. They said that so far, of the 14bn litres of milk Britain produces annually, just 100m litres have been lost because of the slaughter programme. \"At this stage it is too early to say that we are going to run short of milk,\" the NFU said. Half the annual milk quota is used for other dairy products and the NFU said this could be diverted to fresh milk if supplies ran short. Lord Haskins' warning is a blow to the government's hopes that it has the epidemic under control and can proceed with its plans for a May election. A majority of the cabinet wants May 3. And ministers and party officials who are urging an early election will argue that the threat of milk shortages illustrates that delay will only create further problems. Tony Blair will spend the weekend considering the options, with some MPs claiming that he feels uncomfortable at the prospect of campaigning while the animal slaughter mounts. He is also anxious about committing himself to fighting on two fronts, electoral and foot and mouth, at once. Though Labour backbenchers are divided the dominant view of senior ministers such as John Prescott and party officials at Millbank is to go now, even though they know the finely balanced judgment is Mr Blair's alone. Privately, one Tory ex-cabinet heavyweight said: \"He'd be mad to delay.\" The prime minister is expected to gather his closest political intimates, including Gordon Brown, Jonathan Powell, chief of staff, and Alastair Campbell, press secretary, at Chequers on Sunday to decide between May 3 and June 7 - the only real options. \"The word now is that Tony says he won't feel comfortable out there on the stump campaigning normally,\" one well-placed MP said. In his first interview on American television since the crisis broke Mr Blair told NBC: \"There is no reason why your average American tourist or one from any other part of the world cannot come here and have exactly the same holiday as they have always had.\" Millbank is poised to start the campaign next week, though slower than once planned. Mr Blair may stay in No 10 for most of the next two weeks, leaving Mr Brown to take the campaign lead. Mr Hague said: \"I wouldn't have an election at this point to date. That would be putting party before country. I would be concentrating on fighting this disease, not the election.\" \u0095 Ben Gill, NFU president, is live online at 10.30am today.

      "body": "<p>William Hague is, for the first time since he took over as Tory leader, setting the political weather.</p> <p>Even his detractors admit that Mr Hague has judged his interventions on the foot and mouth crisis with great care, wrong-footing the government on numerous occasions. \"William's having a good war,\" said one Tory MP, not noted for his admiration of Mr Hague.</p> <p>The Tory leader managed to dominate early headlines yesterday when he finally called on Tony Blair to cancel plans for a general election on May 3. Sweeping aside fears that he might appear to be running scared of an election, Mr Hague claimed that calling an election now would place \"party before country\".</p> <p>His intervention, during a visit to Cumbria, was the culmination of weeks of anguish over how to respond to the foot and mouth crisis. No grand Tory strategy was mapped out on day one because nobody knew how serious the disease would be. But the Hague strategy has gone through three distinct phases.</p> <p>When foot and mouth was first confirmed, Mr Hague instructed the shadow cabinet to adopt a bipartisan approach and to say nothing about postponing the election.</p> <p>As the number of cases increased, Mr Hague offered constructive criticisms of the government and raised doubts about holding the local elections on May 3.</p> <p>In the last two weeks, the gloves came off and Mr Hague launched stinging attacks on the government for failing to take hold of the crisis and for appearing to press ahead with elections.</p> <p>One shadow minister said that Mr Hague felt that it was important to adopt a bipartisan approach initially because the Tories would not be rewarded for scoring political points during a national crisis.</p> <p>As the crisis deepened, Mr Hague moved away from his bipartisan approach on March 13 when he used a visit to Cheltenham to call on the government to give a six month \"business rate holiday\" to all businesses hit by foot and mouth.</p> <p>During his Commons clash with the prime minister the following day, Mr Hague called for a policy of immediate slaughter and for the army's role to be stepped up.</p> <p>As speculation intensified about the election, Mr Hague used a visit to Cumbria on March 15 to raise his first doubts about election timing. In careful language, he warned that foot and mouth was having a \"devastating impact\".</p> <p>While the political truce had ended, open political warfare had yet to break out.</p> <p>At a press conference on March 20, Mr Hague said the government should introduce legislation to allow the county council elections to be postponed.</p> <p>Appearing on a platform stripped of Tory symbols, Mr Hague said: \"I don't think it would be right to call an election at a time when there is a national crisis out of control.\"</p> <p>It was at the end of last week, when an official epidemiological report forecast a possible 4,400 cases of foot and mouth by June, that Mr Hague lambasted the prime minister for mishandling the crisis.</p> <p>Mr Hague used a speech in Coventry to call on the prime minister to set up a \"crisis cabinet\" to deal with foot and mouth. He likened the crisis in the countryside to wartime Britain.</p> <p>Tory sources privately hope that foot and mouth will help them whenever the election is held. If Tony Blair opts for May 3, the Tories hope to win support from voters who share his view that an early election is inappropriate.</p> <p>If foot and mouth forces the prime minister to delay the election, Tories hope the expected downturn in the economy will pay dividends.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, however, the Tories' position in the polls remains as dire as ever.</p> <p><b>Email

      "bodyText": "William Hague is, for the first time since he took over as Tory leader, setting the political weather. Even his detractors admit that Mr Hague has judged his interventions on the foot and mouth crisis with great care, wrong-footing the government on numerous occasions. \"William's having a good war,\" said one Tory MP, not noted for his admiration of Mr Hague. The Tory leader managed to dominate early headlines yesterday when he finally called on Tony Blair to cancel plans for a general election on May 3. Sweeping aside fears that he might appear to be running scared of an election, Mr Hague claimed that calling an election now would place \"party before country\". His intervention, during a visit to Cumbria, was the culmination of weeks of anguish over how to respond to the foot and mouth crisis. No grand Tory strategy was mapped out on day one because nobody knew how serious the disease would be. But the Hague strategy has gone through three distinct phases. When foot and mouth was first confirmed, Mr Hague instructed the shadow cabinet to adopt a bipartisan approach and to say nothing about postponing the election. As the number of cases increased, Mr Hague offered constructive criticisms of the government and raised doubts about holding the local elections on May 3. In the last two weeks, the gloves came off and Mr Hague launched stinging attacks on the government for failing to take hold of the crisis and for appearing to press ahead with elections. One shadow minister said that Mr Hague felt that it was important to adopt a bipartisan approach initially because the Tories would not be rewarded for scoring political points during a national crisis. As the crisis deepened, Mr Hague moved away from his bipartisan approach on March 13 when he used a visit to Cheltenham to call on the government to give a six month \"business rate holiday\" to all businesses hit by foot and mouth. During his Commons clash with the prime minister the following day, Mr Hague called for a policy of immediate slaughter and for the army's role to be stepped up. As speculation intensified about the election, Mr Hague used a visit to Cumbria on March 15 to raise his first doubts about election timing. In careful language, he warned that foot and mouth was having a \"devastating impact\". While the political truce had ended, open political warfare had yet to break out. At a press conference on March 20, Mr Hague said the government should introduce legislation to allow the county council elections to be postponed. Appearing on a platform stripped of Tory symbols, Mr Hague said: \"I don't think it would be right to call an election at a time when there is a national crisis out of control.\" It was at the end of last week, when an official epidemiological report forecast a possible 4,400 cases of foot and mouth by June, that Mr Hague lambasted the prime minister for mishandling the crisis. Mr Hague used a speech in Coventry to call on the prime minister to set up a \"crisis cabinet\" to deal with foot and mouth. He likened the crisis in the countryside to wartime Britain. Tory sources privately hope that foot and mouth will help them whenever the election is held. If Tony Blair opts for May 3, the Tories hope to win support from voters who share his view that an early election is inappropriate. If foot and mouth forces the prime minister to delay the election, Tories hope the expected downturn in the economy will pay dividends. Against this backdrop, however, the Tories' position in the polls remains as dire as ever.

      "byline": "Julia Finch, city editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The ailing Marks &amp; Spencer store group yesterday embarked on a radical retrenchment in an attempt to restore its faded fortunes, slashing 4,390 jobs and closing its 38-strong chain of European stores. </p> <p>The store chain - which has been battered by a sea change in shopping habits as consumers have deserted the middle market in favour of discounters and designer brands - is also axing its loss-making mail-order business and has put its two US businesses up for sale. </p> <p>At the same time the huge new flagship M&amp;S store in central Manchester - built after the city centre was devastated by an IRA bomb - is to be sliced in half, with the unwanted half being sold to rival Selfridges. </p> <p>Chairman Luc Vandevelde said he intended to concentrate on improving the UK stores and winning back previously loyal customers. The priority, he said, would be to concentrate on \"classically stylish\" fashions with the quality and fit M&amp;S was once famous for. Prices will also be cut. </p> <p>The pressure on Mr Vandevelde to turn the business round is growing almost daily. When the Belgian supermarket boss was headhunted to join M&amp;S a year ago, he said it would take two years to rebuild M&amp;S. Halfway to that self-imposed deadline, there is still no sign of any improvements, and yesterday he admitted that M&amp;S was in far worse shape than he thought when he took the job. \"If I had known then what I know now, I would have acted earlier.\" </p> <p>The 38 European stores, including 18 in France, will close by the end of the year at the cost of 3,350 jobs. </p> <p>A further 690 jobs will be lost in the mail-order business and 350 in the group's Baker Street head office. Mr Vandevelde said he was sorry \"to disappoint the large number of staff who have been doing an excellent job\". It will cost \u00a3300m to close the European and mail-order operations - and save \u00a350m a year. </p> <p>The US businesses - Kings Supermarkets and Brooks Brothers, a preppie menswear chain, which cost $860m to buy - are to be sold as soon as possible. M&amp;S said they had already received offers. </p> <p>Another branch of the international business - 10 stores in Hong Kong - will be packaged up and sold to a franchise operator. </p> <p>The international businesses were always viewed as a springboard to turn M&amp;S into a global operator, and when Mr Vandevelde moved into M&amp;S a year ago he insisted he was committed to international expansion. But yesterday he said the overseas operations were \"the wrong platform\" for expansion and added: \"Let's get our house in order here before we do that\". </p> <p>Mr Vandevelde described his new plan as \"a dramatic, urgent, thorough correction\" to halt the decline of the group, which until 1998 was viewed as the gold standard for the retailing business.

      "bodyText": "The ailing Marks &amp; Spencer store group yesterday embarked on a radical retrenchment in an attempt to restore its faded fortunes, slashing 4,390 jobs and closing its 38-strong chain of European stores. The store chain - which has been battered by a sea change in shopping habits as consumers have deserted the middle market in favour of discounters and designer brands - is also axing its loss-making mail-order business and has put its two US businesses up for sale. At the same time the huge new flagship M&amp;S store in central Manchester - built after the city centre was devastated by an IRA bomb - is to be sliced in half, with the unwanted half being sold to rival Selfridges. Chairman Luc Vandevelde said he intended to concentrate on improving the UK stores and winning back previously loyal customers. The priority, he said, would be to concentrate on \"classically stylish\" fashions with the quality and fit M&amp;S was once famous for. Prices will also be cut. The pressure on Mr Vandevelde to turn the business round is growing almost daily. When the Belgian supermarket boss was headhunted to join M&amp;S a year ago, he said it would take two years to rebuild M&amp;S. Halfway to that self-imposed deadline, there is still no sign of any improvements, and yesterday he admitted that M&amp;S was in far worse shape than he thought when he took the job. \"If I had known then what I know now, I would have acted earlier.\" The 38 European stores, including 18 in France, will close by the end of the year at the cost of 3,350 jobs. A further 690 jobs will be lost in the mail-order business and 350 in the group's Baker Street head office. Mr Vandevelde said he was sorry \"to disappoint the large number of staff who have been doing an excellent job\". It will cost \u00a3300m to close the European and mail-order operations - and save \u00a350m a year. The US businesses - Kings Supermarkets and Brooks Brothers, a preppie menswear chain, which cost $860m to buy - are to be sold as soon as possible. M&amp;S said they had already received offers. Another branch of the international business - 10 stores in Hong Kong - will be packaged up and sold to a franchise operator. The international businesses were always viewed as a springboard to turn M&amp;S into a global operator, and when Mr Vandevelde moved into M&amp;S a year ago he insisted he was committed to international expansion. But yesterday he said the overseas operations were \"the wrong platform\" for expansion and added: \"Let's get our house in order here before we do that\". Mr Vandevelde described his new plan as \"a dramatic, urgent, thorough correction\" to halt the decline of the group, which until 1998 was viewed as the gold standard for the retailing business. At that point, the chain's sales fell off a cliff and it has been unable to halt the slide ever since. Its profits have slumped from more than \u00a31bn to \u00a3557m, and City analysts are expecting M&amp;S to bring in \u00a3100m less than that this year. Shareholders have also been punished. The shares, which stood at 664p just over three years ago are changing hands at 266.5p. As part of the recovery plan announced yesterday, the group said it was selling half its property portfolio and will return the \u00a32bn raised to shareholders - which will underpin the share price. M&amp;S has made several vain attempts to win back business - from special offers to its \"I'm normal\" advertising campaign last year featuring a naked size 16 model running across fields. It has changed its trademark carrier bags, started buying more clothes from abroad to cut costs and launched an expensive range of upmarket designer clothes under the Autograph label. Every member of the board has been replaced and at one point the chain had more than 30 firms of outside consultants working on improving the store. So far, however, its efforts have had little effect. Its advertising campaign was panned and the Autograph range has fallen well short of sales targets. \"We may have oversold Autograph\", Mr Vandevelde conceded yesterday.

      "body": "<p>An Essex businessman yesterday unveiled plans to open Britain's first racecourse for 74 years as part of a revolutionary scheme to appeal to the burgeoning internet and offshore telephone betting industry. </p> <p>John Holmes, a former showjumper turned entrepreneur, said the course would be built at the Essex County Showground, north of Chelmsford on the outskirts of Braintree, and should be ready to open in May next year. He has already had discussions with the British Horseracing Board, but the scheme will almost certainly bring him into conflict with the racing establishment. </p> <p>Holmes plans to create a training facility at the 165-acre site for 120 horses, who will run once or twice a week in the late morning, prior to the start of other meetings. The timing would be ideal for live broadcasting to the Far East, which already generates hundreds of millions of pounds in betting revenue each year. </p> <p>\"So far 30 owners have expressed an interest in having a horse, or horses, based here,\" said Holmes. \"Followers of racing don't need to be told that it is about to go through changes in promotion, control and revenue streams that could not have been imagined 10, maybe even five years ago. </p> <p>\"Not everyone will like the results but there is definitely a demand for the style of operation we plan at Great Leighs. Clearly it is far from being satisfied at the moment. I believe I have the right place at the right time to provide a bespoke solution. I've been approached by a few internet gaming companies and a number of off-shore bookmakers, so the odds-making side will be dealt with.\" </p> <p>Internet business is already revolutionising racing in Britain, with punters able to bet at the push of a button instead of visiting betting shops. But whereas betting has long since outgrown the tic-tac men, most British courses remain untouched by time. </p> <p>There is no racecourse nearby to rival Great Leighs, which is roughly equidistant from Newmarket and Epsom. But the new course would be a slap in the face for Fairlop Waters in Barkingside, which has BHB approval and which hopes to start racing within a few years. </p> <p>Holmes claims the course is \"just 35 minutes away from London, so it could be a great day out for those in the city\". But the man who made a fortune trading horses in the 70s before moving into cellular airtime retailing and the dot.com world sees his media-led enterprise appealing more to a market that will not necessarily be at trackside. With the abolition of betting tax coming into force in January 2002, the global gaming market could be worth \u00a31trillion. </p> <p>Holmes said: \"I don't know what the established 59 racecourses have in mind for the future. But I do think this is a most worthwhile venture. This is not a sudden whim. It has been planned for some time.\" </p> <p>Since he bought the property in 1997, Holmes has promoted the site as an equestrian centre while continuing to stage the annual Essex Show. \"The infrastructure is tried and tested. And after four years here I know all about things like public safety, hygiene and even toilet facilities. So I've learned the hard way. </p> <p>\"I'm planning something that should co-exist with the existing tracks. I'm not looking to fall out with anyone; I want to be part of the racing establishment. I don't expect the BHB or the Jockey Club to embrace the idea, exactly. But at the same time they have given me no indication that they will oppose it. I share their zest for the integrity of racing and for the procedures that go with it.\" </p> <p>Holmes, whose family has a long history in equestrianism, and whose uncle Harry Holmes was a successful showjumping owner on the county circuit, said: \"At the moment I cannot deliver big prize money. But I'm talking to the people who can provide it. And if I can just have the chance to prove what I can do, and then get my licence, the prize money will follow. I've got to do it this way because if I asked the BHB for permission they would have said no.\" </p> <p>A BHB spokesman said last night: \"We have had very preliminary discussions with Mr Holmes and look forward to talking to him again. But we can say nothing at this stage.\"</p>",

      "byline": "Nicholas Wood in Krivenik,  Jonathan Steele  in Pristina and Matt Wells",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A British television producer was among three people killed yesterday as fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Macedonian security forces spilled over the border into neighbouring Kosovo. </p> <p>Kerem Lawton, a 30-year-old journalist with the Associated Press news agency was killed when a barrage of mortar shells fell on the Kosovan village of Krivenik, less than a mile from the border with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. </p> <p>The attack followed a bombardment by the Macedonian army of a nearby ethnic Albanian guerrilla base just inside Macedonia. At least 20 other people were reported injured. Ayllejman Klokoqi, an APTN cameraman, had left the car moments earlier. \"I saw people lying on the ground. I started shouting, 'Kerem! Kerem!' Then I saw Kerem in the car,\" he said. </p> <p>Fezula Krasnici, who lives near the scene of the attack, said the mortars landed as Mr Lawton was interviewing people beside the village school. \"When the explosions started he tried to run away, but another explosion went off and he was hit too,\" he said. </p> <p>United States troops attached to the international intervention force in Kosovo (K-For) were the first to reach the injured. \"When the first four mortars were fired, very quickly I took my motorbike to get K-For and they came back with me to see what was happening,\" said Mr Krasnici. </p> <p>\"I was trying to tell them to get the people out of the village, but they said we have to see what's going on first, we'll take care of that later. Ten minutes later, the mortars were hitting the middle of the village, where everyone was standing, including the television team.\" The other victims were Ilaz Thaci, a 33-year-old teacher, and Baki Krasniqi, 19. </p> <p>Nato medics took him Mr Lawton by road to Camp Bondsteel, a US military base in Kosovo, but he was dead on arrival at the base hospital. </p> <p>\"We are all grief-stricken at this loss,\" said Louis Boccardi, president and chief executive of Associated Press. \"Kerem's courage and devotion to gathering the story reached beyond any words we can say.\" He was the third member of APTN to lose his life in just over two years. </p> <p>Mr Lawton had been based for the past several months in Pristina, the capital of the Kosovo province. He was married to a Kosovo Albanian, Elida Ramadani, 27. She is eight months pregnant and lives in Pristina. </p> <p>Just before being hit yesterday, Kerem Lawton had been sitting in a cafe waiting for the arrival of British troops due to be deployed on the border with Macedonia. His plans changed, however, when news of increased fighting around Krivenik came through. Fellow members of the AP team at the same cafe, said they had suggested he should not go. </p> <p>There was confusion over who fired the shells. Government spokesman Gjeorgi Tremdefilov said there was \"not the remotest possibility\" that Macedonian soldiers had fired the shells. </p> <p>But K-For issued a statement. \"K-For regrets the incident took place and that the lives of our soldiers were endangered in an area that is clearly inside Kosovo territory,\" said Major Axel-Bernd Jandesek, spokesman for the international peacekeepers. </p> <p>The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Hans Haekkerup, called on the Macedonian government to change tack. \"I deeply regret this tragedy which has cost the lives of innocent civilians. I will be raising the urgent need for restraint by the Macedonian forces and for dialogue to replace shooting when I visit Skopje tomorrow.\" </p> <p>The attack comes as the Macedonian government had been claiming considerable success in flushing out National Liberation Army (NLA) gunmen from villages around Tetovo. It appeared to be following a similar approach close to the border with Krivenik. </p> <p>But the NLA showed little sign of caving into the Macedonian army's offensive. \"For several days they've being try ing to take our positions, but there's no way they can do it. We will continue to defend ourselves,\" said the 25-year-old commander of the base. In the last week just three out of 200 fighters have been injured. </p> <p>On the Kosovo side of the border, British troops with so phisticated night vision equipment and backed by helicopters have started patrolling near where the mortar bombs landed. </p> <p>Up to 200 British soldiers and 250 from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Latvia, and the Czech republic have moved into bases close to the border. </p> <p>K-For insists that the men will not cross the border into Macedonia. It has no mandate to do so, even if requested by the Macedonian government. </p> <p> <strong>What's going on?</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,450658,00.html\">The fighting in Macedonia explained</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,459237,00.html\">Map: where is Tetovo?</a></p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8064c/0\">Should Nato intervene?</a></p> <p><strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0320carroll.ra\">Rory Carroll on the mountain massacre threat (2mins 45)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/article/0,5814,387922,00.html\">How do I listen to audio reports?</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/audio/\">More audio reports</a></p> <p><strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,460071,00.html\">The conflict in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Kosovo/\">Kosovo</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/serbia/0,2759,221850,00.html\">Serbia</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yugo\">Yugoslavia war crimes</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.gov.mk/english\">Macedonian government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.morm.gov.mk/granica/nastanie.htm\">Macedonian defence ministry - updates on border clashes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\">Albanian foreign ministry</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.albanian.com/main/countries/macedonia/\">Albania.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.al\">Albanian foreign ministry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gov.yu/1024/index.html\">Yugoslav government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4821\">Foreign secretary Robin Cook's statement on Macedonia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.kforonline.com/news/updates.htm\">K-For news updates</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A British television producer was among three people killed yesterday as fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Macedonian security forces spilled over the border into neighbouring Kosovo. Kerem Lawton, a 30-year-old journalist with the Associated Press news agency was killed when a barrage of mortar shells fell on the Kosovan village of Krivenik, less than a mile from the border with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The attack followed a bombardment by the Macedonian army of a nearby ethnic Albanian guerrilla base just inside Macedonia. At least 20 other people were reported injured. Ayllejman Klokoqi, an APTN cameraman, had left the car moments earlier. \"I saw people lying on the ground. I started shouting, 'Kerem! Kerem!' Then I saw Kerem in the car,\" he said. Fezula Krasnici, who lives near the scene of the attack, said the mortars landed as Mr Lawton was interviewing people beside the village school. \"When the explosions started he tried to run away, but another explosion went off and he was hit too,\" he said. United States troops attached to the international intervention force in Kosovo (K-For) were the first to reach the injured. \"When the first four mortars were fired, very quickly I took my motorbike to get K-For and they came back with me to see what was happening,\" said Mr Krasnici. \"I was trying to tell them to get the people out of the village, but they said we have to see what's going on first, we'll take care of that later. Ten minutes later, the mortars were hitting the middle of the village, where everyone was standing, including the television team.\" The other victims were Ilaz Thaci, a 33-year-old teacher, and Baki Krasniqi, 19. Nato medics took him Mr Lawton by road to Camp Bondsteel, a US military base in Kosovo, but he was dead on arrival at the base hospital. \"We are all grief-stricken at this loss,\" said Louis Boccardi, president and chief executive of Associated Press. \"Kerem's courage and devotion to gathering the story reached beyond any words we can say.\" He was the third member of APTN to lose his life in just over two years. Mr Lawton had been based for the past several months in Pristina, the capital of the Kosovo province. He was married to a Kosovo Albanian, Elida Ramadani, 27. She is eight months pregnant and lives in Pristina. Just before being hit yesterday, Kerem Lawton had been sitting in a cafe waiting for the arrival of British troops due to be deployed on the border with Macedonia. His plans changed, however, when news of increased fighting around Krivenik came through. Fellow members of the AP team at the same cafe, said they had suggested he should not go. There was confusion over who fired the shells. Government spokesman Gjeorgi Tremdefilov said there was \"not the remotest possibility\" that Macedonian soldiers had fired the shells. But K-For issued a statement. \"K-For regrets the incident took place and that the lives of our soldiers were endangered in an area that is clearly inside Kosovo territory,\" said Major Axel-Bernd Jandesek, spokesman for the international peacekeepers. The head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Hans Haekkerup, called on the Macedonian government to change tack. \"I deeply regret this tragedy which has cost the lives of innocent civilians. I will be raising the urgent need for restraint by the Macedonian forces and for dialogue to replace shooting when I visit Skopje tomorrow.\" The attack comes as the Macedonian government had been claiming considerable success in flushing out National Liberation Army (NLA) gunmen from villages around Tetovo. It appeared to be following a similar approach close to the border with Krivenik. But the NLA showed little sign of caving into the Macedonian army's offensive. \"For several days they've being try ing to take our positions, but there's no way they can do it. We will continue to defend ourselves,\" said the 25-year-old commander of the base. In the last week just three out of 200 fighters have been injured. On the Kosovo side of the border, British troops with so phisticated night vision equipment and backed by helicopters have started patrolling near where the mortar bombs landed. Up to 200 British soldiers and 250 from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Latvia, and the Czech republic have moved into bases close to the border. K-For insists that the men will not cross the border into Macedonia. It has no mandate to do so, even if requested by the Macedonian government. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>A stunt for a bizarre television show in which participants are invited to eat quantities of hard-boiled eggs in an effort to be sick has incurred the disapproval of dieticians. </p> <p>The entertainment network MTV is boasting of the \"sickest show on television\", as competitors on Jackass line up to throw up. Contestants around the country are filmed eating as many eggs as possible before vomiting. </p> <p>\"If you are faint-hearted, delicately dispositioned or are a regular reader of the Daily Mail, look away now,\" MTV declares in its promotional material. \"The show is sick (as well as immature, shocking, dangerous and irresponsible). But so what? Arrested development can be fun!\" </p> <p>However, dieticians are warning that MTV could be taking things too far. The British Nutritional Foundation said the acid contained in the eggs could have a detrimental effect on the participants, and the British Dietetic Association is concerned that the show could encourage binge eating. </p> <p>\"There are a number of side-affects to eating so many eggs in a short period of time. If you look at a number of people who have suffered with eating disorders such as bulimia, they do not have very nice teeth,\" a spokesman for the British Nutritional Foundation said. \"The acid rots away at the teeth, and seriously damages the look and shape of them. Most people can eat an egg a day and still keep their cholesterol levels at a reasonable level, but when they eat excessive amounts it can be harmful to their health.\" </p> <p>MTV is promoting the show in Britain with the Jackass Pukestock Tour, in which passersby in city shopping districts are invited to take part in a replication of the egg eating stunt which has already been undertaken by US contestants. The tour went to Newcastle yesterday, and reaches Glasgow today. </p> <p>Jackass has become a hit in the US, where it is the most popular cable TV show among 12- to 34-year-olds. The British egg eating will feature in promoting the show's transmission in this country. </p> <p>MTV yesterday denied that the show, which airs on Friday night and is its top-rating programme in Britain, was irresponsible. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"It's very clearly done as a stunt, as a game. It's not in any way encouraging people to binge. It's just a complete laugh.\" </p> <p>And the promotional material concludes: \"Jackass features stunts by professionals and/or total idiots. </p> <p>\"MTV insists that neither you nor any of your friends attempt this dangerous rubbish at home.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A stunt for a bizarre television show in which participants are invited to eat quantities of hard-boiled eggs in an effort to be sick has incurred the disapproval of dieticians. The entertainment network MTV is boasting of the \"sickest show on television\", as competitors on Jackass line up to throw up. Contestants around the country are filmed eating as many eggs as possible before vomiting. \"If you are faint-hearted, delicately dispositioned or are a regular reader of the Daily Mail, look away now,\" MTV declares in its promotional material. \"The show is sick (as well as immature, shocking, dangerous and irresponsible). But so what? Arrested development can be fun!\" However, dieticians are warning that MTV could be taking things too far. The British Nutritional Foundation said the acid contained in the eggs could have a detrimental effect on the participants, and the British Dietetic Association is concerned that the show could encourage binge eating. \"There are a number of side-affects to eating so many eggs in a short period of time. If you look at a number of people who have suffered with eating disorders such as bulimia, they do not have very nice teeth,\" a spokesman for the British Nutritional Foundation said. \"The acid rots away at the teeth, and seriously damages the look and shape of them. Most people can eat an egg a day and still keep their cholesterol levels at a reasonable level, but when they eat excessive amounts it can be harmful to their health.\" MTV is promoting the show in Britain with the Jackass Pukestock Tour, in which passersby in city shopping districts are invited to take part in a replication of the egg eating stunt which has already been undertaken by US contestants. The tour went to Newcastle yesterday, and reaches Glasgow today. Jackass has become a hit in the US, where it is the most popular cable TV show among 12- to 34-year-olds. The British egg eating will feature in promoting the show's transmission in this country. MTV yesterday denied that the show, which airs on Friday night and is its top-rating programme in Britain, was irresponsible. A spokeswoman said: \"It's very clearly done as a stunt, as a game. It's not in any way encouraging people to binge. It's just a complete laugh.\" And the promotional material concludes: \"Jackass features stunts by professionals and/or total idiots. \"MTV insists that neither you nor any of your friends attempt this dangerous rubbish at home.\"",

Should it keep interest rates on hold while all about are cutting theirs in determined pursuit of the holy grail of price stability? Or should it make a friend of the trend and, in line with other central banks, cut rates as its contribution to the global battle against recession? </p> <p>Yesterday, despite the hopes which had been building up in the financial markets and which the bank had, arguably, been encouraging, it opted to do nothing. Whether the policy should be put down as masterly inactivity or worried indecision is not clear. Not that such considerations bothered the foreign exchange market. No news was not greeted as good news. Dealers promptly dumped the single currency - pushing it down to its lowest level this year. </p> <p><strong> Rapid reaction</strong><br> </p> <p> Nor is the ECB off the interest rate hook. Expectations have simply switched to the pre-Easter meeting on April 11. Yesterday's response from the forex market's rapid reaction force was a warning to the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, of what will happen if he fails to deliver in two weeks' time. </p> <p>For the markets and many analysts, the ECB's policymaking should be a breeze. The US has slowed sharply - at best. Japan is mired in recession. Equity markets have a white-knuckled look about them. The numbers from parts of the eurozone don't look too bad but Germany - the biggest bit - is heading for the doldrums. </p> <p>So, get on with it - cut rates, boost growth prospects and watch the euro rise. Forget inflation. The global slowdown and a stronger currency will take care of that. </p> <p>Yet as Mr Duisenberg sits in his eyrie in the ECB tower in central Frankfurt, puffing on the inevitable cigarette, the choice is not quite so easy. When the idea of the single currency was sold to both the international investment community and to the citizens of the 12-nation single currency zone, nobody discouraged the belief that the euro would be a clone of that then favourite of the forex market - the German mark. </p> <p>The snag is that the impression has stuck. When investors want a view on the eurozone they tend to look at Germany. The view is not encouraging. </p> <p>Little wonder that the euro fell from $1.17 to little more than 80 cents in less than two years. Or that the subsequent 15% rally on the back of a bombing US economy ran out of steam the moment the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates. At not much over 88 cents, the euro is starting to resemble the Grand Old Duke of York's army - marched all the way up to the top of the hill, only to be marched back down again. </p> <p>Secondly the ECB's central mandate is not to foster growth, it is to keep the lid firmly on inflation. True, interest rates can be set with a view to supporting the general economic policy of the eurozone - but not at the price of jeopardising price stability. Though there is a reasonable expectation that inflation will head down it is still some way north of the ECB's 2% ceiling. The ECB's favourite monetary aggregate, M3, is hardly pointing the way to lower rates either. </p> <p>\"If the decision was a close call, probably the anxiety over inflation levels and the M3 growth number won the day,\" according to Bernard Walschots at Holland's Rabobank. </p> <p>The bank has a longer term agenda. It has argued that countries within the eurozone need to embrace structural economic reforms. There are signs some heed is being paid but the pace of change is scarcely break neck and is unlikely to pick up speed if the ECB shows it is prepared to let interest rates, rather than reform, take the strain. </p> <p>There are political complications, too. The European Commission president, Romano Prodi, yesterday argued: \"The ECB must be independent but must not suffer from loneliness. Europe now lacks strong political structures because national states do not want to create them. </p> <p>\"In the United States [Fed chairman Alan] Greenspan feels the vibrant politics that surrounds him. He keeps his independence but has next to him strong political institutions. </p> <p>\"The trouble is that no-one wants to believe that the ECB is independent... and there is a view that the United States is a giant and Europe a dwarf. But future events will dispel this impression.\" </p> <p>Quite whether Mr Duisenberg would feel comfortable surrounded by \"vibrant politics\" is an interesting question. But he would doubtless feel happier if national politicians showed greater willingness to coordinate their fiscal policies with the ECB's monetary one. </p> <p>There may be arguments for suggesting that Ireland is a special case but the ECB must be looking at some of the promises being made in the Italian election campaign and wondering quite how they square with the eurozone's stability pact which is meant to keep budget debt and deficits in line. But then politicians have elections to win. </p> <p>Nor do the politics stop there. In nine months' time the 12 countries of the eurozone will have to give up their national currencies in favour of euronotes and coins. The change over must go well. A political generation in Europe has staked its credibility on making the euro work. </p> <p>Yet as the value of the euro rises, or more often, falls according to the whim of the foreign exchange market, Europe's savers are tending to the sceptical. The ECB needs to be able to demonstrate that it has at least some control over the external value of the single currency. </p> <p>Harold Wilson's \"the pound in your pocket has not been devalued\" style of argument cuts little ice even if, in a near closed economy like the eurozone, they have some merit. </p> <p><strong> Cartoon character</strong><br> </p> <p> The ECB may be rescued by the dollar, finally losing favour with investors. It seems hardly credible that the greenback can continue to be the world's reserve currency while the US is running a current account deficit of 4.4% of GDP and share values are plummeting. Like the cartoon character who has run over a cliff and doesn't realise he's suspended in midair, sooner or later, the dollar is going to fall. </p> <p>What matters is whether this will happen soon enough to rescue the ECB from its dilemma and whether the bank can persuade its two constituencies - the world's financial markets and Europe's citizens - that it always knew it was going to happen. In short that it was Wim's whim, not that of the forex market.</p>",

Or that the subsequent 15% rally on the back of a bombing US economy ran out of steam the moment the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates. At not much over 88 cents, the euro is starting to resemble the Grand Old Duke of York's army - marched all the way up to the top of the hill, only to be marched back down again. Secondly the ECB's central mandate is not to foster growth, it is to keep the lid firmly on inflation. True, interest rates can be set with a view to supporting the general economic policy of the eurozone - but not at the price of jeopardising price stability. Though there is a reasonable expectation that inflation will head down it is still some way north of the ECB's 2% ceiling. The ECB's favourite monetary aggregate, M3, is hardly pointing the way to lower rates either. \"If the decision was a close call, probably the anxiety over inflation levels and the M3 growth number won the day,\" according to Bernard Walschots at Holland's Rabobank. The bank has a longer term agenda. It has argued that countries within the eurozone need to embrace structural economic reforms. There are signs some heed is being paid but the pace of change is scarcely break neck and is unlikely to pick up speed if the ECB shows it is prepared to let interest rates, rather than reform, take the strain. There are political complications, too. The European Commission president, Romano Prodi, yesterday argued: \"The ECB must be independent but must not suffer from loneliness. Europe now lacks strong political structures because national states do not want to create them. \"In the United States [Fed chairman Alan] Greenspan feels the vibrant politics that surrounds him. He keeps his independence but has next to him strong political institutions. \"The trouble is that no-one wants to believe that the ECB is independent... and there is a view that the United States is a giant and Europe a dwarf. But future events will dispel this impression.\" Quite whether Mr Duisenberg would feel comfortable surrounded by \"vibrant politics\" is an interesting question. But he would doubtless feel happier if national politicians showed greater willingness to coordinate their fiscal policies with the ECB's monetary one. There may be arguments for suggesting that Ireland is a special case but the ECB must be looking at some of the promises being made in the Italian election campaign and wondering quite how they square with the eurozone's stability pact which is meant to keep budget debt and deficits in line. But then politicians have elections to win. Nor do the politics stop there. In nine months' time the 12 countries of the eurozone will have to give up their national currencies in favour of euronotes and coins. The change over must go well. A political generation in Europe has staked its credibility on making the euro work. Yet as the value of the euro rises, or more often, falls according to the whim of the foreign exchange market, Europe's savers are tending to the sceptical. The ECB needs to be able to demonstrate that it has at least some control over the external value of the single currency. Harold Wilson's \"the pound in your pocket has not been devalued\" style of argument cuts little ice even if, in a near closed economy like the eurozone, they have some merit. Cartoon character The ECB may be rescued by the dollar, finally losing favour with investors. It seems hardly credible that the greenback can continue to be the world's reserve currency while the US is running a current account deficit of 4.4% of GDP and share values are plummeting. Like the cartoon character who has run over a cliff and doesn't realise he's suspended in midair, sooner or later, the dollar is going to fall. What matters is whether this will happen soon enough to rescue the ECB from its dilemma and whether the bank can persuade its two constituencies - the world's financial markets and Europe's citizens - that it always knew it was going to happen. In short that it was Wim's whim, not that of the forex market.",

      "body": "<p>In a Carlisle car park, across the road from a farmers' pub, stood a camouflage command truck called Birtie's Battle Wagon. It smelt of pipe smoke.</p> <p>There was a union flag on the bonnet and a makeshift staircase into the back. Inside, stubbing out a cigarette on the side of his boot, was Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, head of the army's foot and mouth operation in Cumbria.</p> <p>He was mapping the enemy with flags and circles on maps. This was the \"deep battle\" phase. \"It is about how to smack the new outbreaks as they come,\" he said.</p> <p>The army has been in Cumbria for 12 days, staying in hotels to put money back into the local economy. Its role is to \"command and control\" the foot and mouth fall-out. Brigadier Birtwistle must clear the backlog of 50,000 dead sheep and 15,000 dead cattle, carry out the cull of 250,000 healthy sheep and coordinate civilians to keep the diagnosis, slaughter and disposal time to a minimum.</p> <p>Around 150 soldiers are working all day, every day. They have already had dug the biggest mass burial pit in Britain and buried more than 35,000 animals. They are working on the biggest funeral pyre. They are collating intelligence, giving slaughtermen weapons training, and working out how to shower down vets fast enough to keep the diagnoses ticking over. They are organising themselves from four camouflage trucks on an industrial estate, by mobile phone.</p> <p>In the car park, men in combat gear and berets strode between lorries, pausing to smoke pipes or cigars and say, \"Roger\" and \"Chop, chop, no pissing about\". Most had served in Bosnia, Sierra Leone or the Gulf. They are known in the farming community for their clipped vowels and organisational skills.</p> <p>Local farmers have held protest meetings in the pub across the road calling the Ministry of Agriculture incompetent and the \"ministry of death\". But they rally round the soldiers who work in conjunction with Maff. \"The army is our only hope,\" said sheep farmer Geoff Bell.</p> <p>When the military arrived, they brought a small team of liaison officers who went to farms in pairs by Land Rover to manage logistics. Brigadier Birtwistle arrived with two clean shirts and was due to retire on Tuesday. New shirts and trousers have now been dispatched and retirement postponed, and his four-wheeled headquarters is surrounded by workmen building a \"Portakabin city\" as a new operations room.</p> <p>\"A week ago we had a tiger by the tail, now we have a tiger by the scruff of the neck, but it could still beat us,\" said Colonel Paul Baker, head of the army logistics operation.</p> <p>The army has compared the disease to the enemy in a war. There is a battle to stay ahead.</p> <p>The men in combat fatigues who travel around \"liaising with locals\" drive a hard bargain. Around 20 miles south, at Penrith's deserted auction market, the furniture and fine arts store had been turned into an operations room for local valuers to price animals for the army's cull.</p> <p>Behind rows of unsold pastoral oil paintings, accounts workers who were laid off last week had returned to answer calls from confused farmers and ensure that enough animals are regularly dispatched to the army's slaughter pits to keep the brigadier happy.</p> <p>Richard Morris, managing director of Penrith Farmers' and Kidd's auctioneers, who own the market, said: \"So often the farmers have had contradictory information or misinformation from Maff. The army have brought discipline and organisation. They just make things happen. It is demanding keeping up with their pace, but that is how it should be.\"</p> <p>Back at the truck, colour coded flow-charts rolled off the temporary printer and the back doors slammed shut for an emergency logistics meeting.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br></p> <p><b>More on the

      "bodyText": "In a Carlisle car park, across the road from a farmers' pub, stood a camouflage command truck called Birtie's Battle Wagon. It smelt of pipe smoke. There was a union flag on the bonnet and a makeshift staircase into the back. Inside, stubbing out a cigarette on the side of his boot, was Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, head of the army's foot and mouth operation in Cumbria. He was mapping the enemy with flags and circles on maps. This was the \"deep battle\" phase. \"It is about how to smack the new outbreaks as they come,\" he said. The army has been in Cumbria for 12 days, staying in hotels to put money back into the local economy. Its role is to \"command and control\" the foot and mouth fall-out. Brigadier Birtwistle must clear the backlog of 50,000 dead sheep and 15,000 dead cattle, carry out the cull of 250,000 healthy sheep and coordinate civilians to keep the diagnosis, slaughter and disposal time to a minimum. Around 150 soldiers are working all day, every day. They have already had dug the biggest mass burial pit in Britain and buried more than 35,000 animals. They are working on the biggest funeral pyre. They are collating intelligence, giving slaughtermen weapons training, and working out how to shower down vets fast enough to keep the diagnoses ticking over. They are organising themselves from four camouflage trucks on an industrial estate, by mobile phone. In the car park, men in combat gear and berets strode between lorries, pausing to smoke pipes or cigars and say, \"Roger\" and \"Chop, chop, no pissing about\". Most had served in Bosnia, Sierra Leone or the Gulf. They are known in the farming community for their clipped vowels and organisational skills. Local farmers have held protest meetings in the pub across the road calling the Ministry of Agriculture incompetent and the \"ministry of death\". But they rally round the soldiers who work in conjunction with Maff. \"The army is our only hope,\" said sheep farmer Geoff Bell. When the military arrived, they brought a small team of liaison officers who went to farms in pairs by Land Rover to manage logistics. Brigadier Birtwistle arrived with two clean shirts and was due to retire on Tuesday. New shirts and trousers have now been dispatched and retirement postponed, and his four-wheeled headquarters is surrounded by workmen building a \"Portakabin city\" as a new operations room. \"A week ago we had a tiger by the tail, now we have a tiger by the scruff of the neck, but it could still beat us,\" said Colonel Paul Baker, head of the army logistics operation. The army has compared the disease to the enemy in a war. There is a battle to stay ahead. The men in combat fatigues who travel around \"liaising with locals\" drive a hard bargain. Around 20 miles south, at Penrith's deserted auction market, the furniture and fine arts store had been turned into an operations room for local valuers to price animals for the army's cull. Behind rows of unsold pastoral oil paintings, accounts workers who were laid off last week had returned to answer calls from confused farmers and ensure that enough animals are regularly dispatched to the army's slaughter pits to keep the brigadier happy. Richard Morris, managing director of Penrith Farmers' and Kidd's auctioneers, who own the market, said: \"So often the farmers have had contradictory information or misinformation from Maff. The army have brought discipline and organisation. They just make things happen. It is demanding keeping up with their pace, but that is how it should be.\" Back at the truck, colour coded flow-charts rolled off the temporary printer and the back doors slammed shut for an emergency logistics meeting.

At the same time his scientific advisers say he must ensure all animals on adjoining farms are slaughtered within the subsequent 48 hours.</p> <p>The move is a clear sign that the government does not have the resources to control the fast moving epidemic in Cumbria. Even with a vaccination programme in place the future looks bleak for Cumbria. Ministers have examined the option of putting some kind of firewall around the county's cattle and sheep, even after the outbreak is ended.</p> <p>Downing Street yesterday sought to put a gloss on some of the more depressing figures. It pointed out that the 24 hour detection to slaughter target is being met in Devon and Anglesey, in part due to new help from the army. It added that the backlog nationally has fallen by 7,000 animals and that the number of animals slaughtered outpaced the number of new infections. Only 1% of farms had been affected, it stressed.</p> <p>But despite only 29 new cases being reported yesterday - compared with the record 49 cases on Wednesday - there are now more than 800,000 animals to be slaughtered, almost twice as many as in the whole of the 1967 outbreak.</p> <p>Ministry of Agriculture figures also show that government confidence that it was bringing the outbreaks under control appears misplaced.</p> <p>Daily totals on the website show the number of animals awaiting slaughter had risen to 292,000, nearly 20,000 more than the day before and this did not count the 700,000 still waiting to be killed under the government's welfare scheme.</p> <p>While the army and the government were concentrating on what they termed the hotspots of Cumbria and Devon it was clear the disease was spreading quickly in other areas.

It is part of the policy to take out the animals either infected or on the neighbouring farms. That remains the key objective, it is a means to allow us to deliver that policy.\"</p> <p>In a bid to underline the message that Britain remains open for business, the government issued new guidance making clear that where the risk of spreading the disease is low, councils should reopen footpaths, in consultation with landowners and managers.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, is

      "body": "<p>The ailing little calf I wrote about on Wednesday died at about the same time we heard of further cases in Northumberland. Suddenly, suspected and confirmed cases seem to be popping up all over the county. It is almost too much to cope with as we try to get on with lambing and calving. How can we remain supportive of Maff's policies when, after six weeks, the situation appears to us in the lambing fields to be totally out of control?</p> <p>The usual practice for a livestock farmer with a dead calf or a lamb, where the cow or ewe has plenty of milk, is to find a replacement. If there is not one available on the home farm then many farmers will buy a calf from a market or dealer to set on. Around here the neighbours usually share out spare lambs - anyone can have one if they need one. The system has always worked well, but this year is different. There is no lamb bank, because the movement of all animals is forbidden. None of us would take the risk of bringing in the disease, even through a tiny lamb.</p> <p>Other diseases, such as bacterial diarrhoea or a contagious abortion can be brought in through this method, so care should be taken. We stopped buying calves in a few years ago, and only took lambs from our closest neighbours.</p> <p>Yesterday we heard the Maff epidemiologists were coming to Hexhamshire Moor, site of the first case in the Pennine mountain chain. A confirmed outbreak was found on Wednesday in a flock. Our friends Nick and Julie Howard have a flock which grazes alongside the infected ones so they fear the worst. The two eldest girls have gone to stay with friends so they can continue their exam preparations.</p> <p>Julie says that at least 20 more farms neighbour the outbreak and the rumours and the counter rumours are not helping anybody to cope. The stress levels are intolerable, and everyone in the area from district councillors upwards is trying to help. Many phone calls about suspected or confirmed cases end up involving major stress counselling. To see our whole industry being destroyed before our eyes is very painful.</p> <p>John and Carol Brown, whose farm lies next to a confirmed case, are still preparing their lambing pens, just in case: but they know their flock will be killed when Maff finally gets around to it. Yesterday Carol was told it might not be for seven to 10 days, so what is the point? By then the infection might have gone through them and be on the march across yet more farms. She says Maff is having trouble locating the adjacent farms, and that they should just ask a farmer.</p> <p>I've just had three phone calls. The first one informed me that Nick and Julie's sheep will be killed, and very soon, but no decision has yet been made about their cattle.</p> <p>The second call was from another farming friend - Annabel Morshead. She is furious. A case of foot and mouth has been confirmed next door to her, and she blames the crass ineptitude of the ministry. It took them more than five weeks to take out a known dangerous contact from sheep in the ring at Longtown Mart.</p> <p>Annabel's 17-year-old son Harry is home from school for the holidays. He has a show Blackface sheep with excellent bloodlines, and worries for her safety. He asked his mother if they were to lose their flock, would they start again? Annabel told him she had no idea where they or anyone else would start, because the best bloodlines and genes were disappearing with the buried sheep and cattle.</p> <p>There was a third call from a vet seconded to Maff in Cumbria. He says the ministry is trying to run a major disease outbreak control from the equivalent of a four-bedroom house in Neasden, while Carlisle mart and its purpose-built facilities are unused. The vets are unhappy at the lack of organisation. There are no proper disinfection facilities - just a sink - and vets are carrying out this essential task themselves. He says there should be a team of technicians and a proper department doing this while the vets see to the animals and help the farmers.</p> <p>Graham, our shepherd, had a run in with someone from the census department.

      "bodyText": "The ailing little calf I wrote about on Wednesday died at about the same time we heard of further cases in Northumberland. Suddenly, suspected and confirmed cases seem to be popping up all over the county. It is almost too much to cope with as we try to get on with lambing and calving. How can we remain supportive of Maff's policies when, after six weeks, the situation appears to us in the lambing fields to be totally out of control? The usual practice for a livestock farmer with a dead calf or a lamb, where the cow or ewe has plenty of milk, is to find a replacement. If there is not one available on the home farm then many farmers will buy a calf from a market or dealer to set on. Around here the neighbours usually share out spare lambs - anyone can have one if they need one. The system has always worked well, but this year is different. There is no lamb bank, because the movement of all animals is forbidden. None of us would take the risk of bringing in the disease, even through a tiny lamb. Other diseases, such as bacterial diarrhoea or a contagious abortion can be brought in through this method, so care should be taken. We stopped buying calves in a few years ago, and only took lambs from our closest neighbours. Yesterday we heard the Maff epidemiologists were coming to Hexhamshire Moor, site of the first case in the Pennine mountain chain. A confirmed outbreak was found on Wednesday in a flock. Our friends Nick and Julie Howard have a flock which grazes alongside the infected ones so they fear the worst. The two eldest girls have gone to stay with friends so they can continue their exam preparations. Julie says that at least 20 more farms neighbour the outbreak and the rumours and the counter rumours are not helping anybody to cope. The stress levels are intolerable, and everyone in the area from district councillors upwards is trying to help. Many phone calls about suspected or confirmed cases end up involving major stress counselling. To see our whole industry being destroyed before our eyes is very painful. John and Carol Brown, whose farm lies next to a confirmed case, are still preparing their lambing pens, just in case: but they know their flock will be killed when Maff finally gets around to it. Yesterday Carol was told it might not be for seven to 10 days, so what is the point? By then the infection might have gone through them and be on the march across yet more farms. She says Maff is having trouble locating the adjacent farms, and that they should just ask a farmer. I've just had three phone calls. The first one informed me that Nick and Julie's sheep will be killed, and very soon, but no decision has yet been made about their cattle. The second call was from another farming friend - Annabel Morshead. She is furious. A case of foot and mouth has been confirmed next door to her, and she blames the crass ineptitude of the ministry. It took them more than five weeks to take out a known dangerous contact from sheep in the ring at Longtown Mart. Annabel's 17-year-old son Harry is home from school for the holidays. He has a show Blackface sheep with excellent bloodlines, and worries for her safety. He asked his mother if they were to lose their flock, would they start again? Annabel told him she had no idea where they or anyone else would start, because the best bloodlines and genes were disappearing with the buried sheep and cattle. There was a third call from a vet seconded to Maff in Cumbria. He says the ministry is trying to run a major disease outbreak control from the equivalent of a four-bedroom house in Neasden, while Carlisle mart and its purpose-built facilities are unused. The vets are unhappy at the lack of organisation. There are no proper disinfection facilities - just a sink - and vets are carrying out this essential task themselves. He says there should be a team of technicians and a proper department doing this while the vets see to the animals and help the farmers. Graham, our shepherd, had a run in with someone from the census department. He told the official in no uncertain terms to go away and send the information by post. He had come out to the farms to see if we needed the forms posted. Now where's the sense in that? \u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

      "body": "<p><strong> Arms </strong><br> </p> <p> Britain should immediately withdraw its Tornado from Iraq and refuse to take part in any further bombing missions, no matter how many shiny new missiles we are promised. Nato should suspend the US, invite Russia to take its place and establish no-fly zones in the north and south of America. (OK, let's say over Nantucket for starters: we don't want to be too ambitious.) Support should be given to any coherent anti-Bush groups that may develop in Washington, though at present there is little evidence of effective opposition groups in the capital. US air bases in the UK should be closed and weedkiller sprinkled on the airmen's golf courses. </p> <p> <strong> Sport </strong><br> </p> <p> All sporting contacts should cease immediately. Pete Sampras will not be permitted to win Wimbledon for the eighth time, and even Jack Straw will accept that Mike Tyson should not be allowed into the country. Tiger Woods will be allowed to compete in the Open, but will have to play blindfold. He will still win, but we shall have made our point. </p> <p>Baseball, basketball and American football will be treated as the ludicrous, TV-dominated non-events they are. The term \"World Series\" to describe a contest between teams from rival American leagues is henceforth banned. We will continue to ignore Nascar racing and the Indianapolis 500. No wrestling will be shown in the UK, no matter how obscure the channel. Continuous coverage of the Ashes will be beamed to the US to demonstrate the historic wrong turning they made by opting for baseball in the middle of the 19th century. </p> <p><strong> History </strong><br> </p> <p> It will be pointed out that the US was late arriving for both world wars, and that we had already softened up the oppo. We could have won the American war of independence if we had really been trying, and if our boys hadn't insisted on wearing red coats which made them such easy targets. As for the Spanish-American war, we imagine Spain could have won that too, but we can't be certain as we have no idea when it took place or what they were fighting about. (1) History books will also make it clear that Ulysses S Grant was a drunk with an outrageous name who took an age to subdue numerically inferior forces in the American civil war. Basically, count it as a win for the South, which will (with a bit of assistance from fifth columnists funded by MI6) rise again. </p> <p> <strong> Film and TV </strong><br> </p> <p> There will be a blanket boycott, except for films by the Coen Brothers, any half-decent new movie by Quentin Tarantino, and anything with Billy Bob Thornton. All references to the Oscars will be banned. Clearly, this will mean newspapers will be very restricted in size, and many supplements will disappear altogether, but these are difficult times and we must all make sacrifices. No US TV will be permitted except the Simpsons, Sex and the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Frasier and Friends. All repeats are prohibited. Blockbusters is out of bounds while sanctions are in force. </p> <p> <strong> T*m C***se </strong><br> </p> <p> No mentions under any circumstances. This is punishable by five years in prison or a fortnight spent watching Eyes Wide Shut, Mission Impossible (I and II), Top Gun, Days of Thunder and Cocktail, whichever punishment is deemed the worse. (2)</p> <p> <strong> Music (pop) </strong><br> </p> <p> White rap music will be banned. Yes, we know that means Eminem. And, yes, we know that he has been compared to Shakespeare by some respected literary figures. But in any war there are victims. Henceforth the only white American rapper permitted is Vanilla Ice, precisely because he is rubbish. Vanilla's collected works will helpfully confirm to us the complete and utter worthlessness of US culture. English musicians will be discouraged from singing in American accents. Large speakers will be put up along the Mexican and Canadian borders which will broadcast the Clash's I'm So Bored With The USA at regular intervals. </p> <p> <strong> Music (classical) </strong><br> </p> <p> No more John Adams operas will be produced, especially those staged by Peter Sellers. So what if that means we won't hear Nixon in China or The Death of Klinghoffer? We can sing-a-long with Harrison Birtwistle instead. Barber's Adagio will also be banned, especially that dreadful dance music version by William Orbit. This will mean long periods of silence on Classic FM, but we all have our crosses to bear. </p> <p> <strong> Expulsions </strong><br> </p> <p> We are sorry that some innocent individuals will be caught up in this imbroglio, but frankly you started this. When that rich bloke appointed ambassador by Bush arrives, he should be detained on arrival, frisked at Heathrow, Diana Ross-style and then sent back on an economy flight via New Delhi. All US embassy staff above second secretary level will be expelled; they're probably just spying on the Russians anyway. Ruby Wax, Paul Gambaccini and Loyd Grossman will also have to go. Madonna can stay as long as she can persuade Guy Ritchie to stop making gangster films (better still, any films). Bob Kiley can definitely stay, ideally becoming mayor of London and/or secretary of state for transport in 2003. </p> <p> <strong> Withdrawals </strong><br> </p> <p> All of the following will be asked to leave the US: Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Ridley Scott, Catherine Zeta Jones (and Michael Douglas if he wants to leave), Tina Brown, Lisa Snowdon (3), Amanda de Cadenet, Christopher Hitchens and Frank McCourt. Salman Rushdie will be asked to speed up his move and make radio broadcasts on the awfulness of life in New York. (4) </p> <p><strong> Apparel </strong><br> </p> <p> Obviously, as the prime minister would say, we will no longer buy anything from Gap, especially those shapeless blue tops that schoolchildren wear instead of uniforms. Tommy Hilfiger is also banned, not that we could afford any of his stuff anyway. Ditto DKNY, whoever they might be. All Calvin Klein clothes are banned with the exception of underwear. Nike trainers are permitted because they are made in the developing world, but people will be encouraged to scrawl graffiti over the company's ads. We will insist on the removal of the Union Jack from all Reebok trainers. Baseball caps may not be worn, especially by prominent political figures. Anyone wearing them back to front will be interned. </p> <p><strong> Coffee </strong><br> </p> <p> It is probably too late to stage a boycott of US-style coffee bars as they account for some 40% of British GDP, so we will need to employ guerrilla tactics. When using Starbucks, refuse to say \"tall\", \"grande\", \"vente\", or any of the other silly names. Say small, medium and large in a posh, supercilious voice. If the pony-tailed assistant encourages you to have a good day, push a full-fat blueberry muffin into his/her face. If newspapers are available on the premises, spread the pages over the floor and all the tables. Never under any circumstances buy in-store mugs, games or CDs. </p> <p> <strong> Cars </strong><br> </p> <p> Vehicles made by Ford and General Motors will be banned. That will have the useful side effect of relieving traffic jams in the UK, showing what really can be achieved to counter pollution. </p> <p> <strong> Restitution </strong><br> </p> <p> Obviously, we want London Bridge and the Queen Mary back.

      "bodyText": "Arms Britain should immediately withdraw its Tornado from Iraq and refuse to take part in any further bombing missions, no matter how many shiny new missiles we are promised. Nato should suspend the US, invite Russia to take its place and establish no-fly zones in the north and south of America. (OK, let's say over Nantucket for starters: we don't want to be too ambitious.) Support should be given to any coherent anti-Bush groups that may develop in Washington, though at present there is little evidence of effective opposition groups in the capital. US air bases in the UK should be closed and weedkiller sprinkled on the airmen's golf courses. Sport All sporting contacts should cease immediately. Pete Sampras will not be permitted to win Wimbledon for the eighth time, and even Jack Straw will accept that Mike Tyson should not be allowed into the country. Tiger Woods will be allowed to compete in the Open, but will have to play blindfold. He will still win, but we shall have made our point. Baseball, basketball and American football will be treated as the ludicrous, TV-dominated non-events they are. The term \"World Series\" to describe a contest between teams from rival American leagues is henceforth banned. We will continue to ignore Nascar racing and the Indianapolis 500. No wrestling will be shown in the UK, no matter how obscure the channel. Continuous coverage of the Ashes will be beamed to the US to demonstrate the historic wrong turning they made by opting for baseball in the middle of the 19th century. History It will be pointed out that the US was late arriving for both world wars, and that we had already softened up the oppo. We could have won the American war of independence if we had really been trying, and if our boys hadn't insisted on wearing red coats which made them such easy targets. As for the Spanish-American war, we imagine Spain could have won that too, but we can't be certain as we have no idea when it took place or what they were fighting about. (1) History books will also make it clear that Ulysses S Grant was a drunk with an outrageous name who took an age to subdue numerically inferior forces in the American civil war. Basically, count it as a win for the South, which will (with a bit of assistance from fifth columnists funded by MI6) rise again. Film and TV There will be a blanket boycott, except for films by the Coen Brothers, any half-decent new movie by Quentin Tarantino, and anything with Billy Bob Thornton. All references to the Oscars will be banned. Clearly, this will mean newspapers will be very restricted in size, and many supplements will disappear altogether, but these are difficult times and we must all make sacrifices. No US TV will be permitted except the Simpsons, Sex and the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Frasier and Friends. All repeats are prohibited. Blockbusters is out of bounds while sanctions are in force. T*m C***se No mentions under any circumstances. This is punishable by five years in prison or a fortnight spent watching Eyes Wide Shut, Mission Impossible (I and II), Top Gun, Days of Thunder and Cocktail, whichever punishment is deemed the worse. (2) Music (pop) White rap music will be banned. Yes, we know that means Eminem. And, yes, we know that he has been compared to Shakespeare by some respected literary figures. But in any war there are victims. Henceforth the only white American rapper permitted is Vanilla Ice, precisely because he is rubbish. Vanilla's collected works will helpfully confirm to us the complete and utter worthlessness of US culture. English musicians will be discouraged from singing in American accents. Large speakers will be put up along the Mexican and Canadian borders which will broadcast the Clash's I'm So Bored With The USA at regular intervals. Music (classical) No more John Adams operas will be produced, especially those staged by Peter Sellers. So what if that means we won't hear Nixon in China or The Death of Klinghoffer? We can sing-a-long with Harrison Birtwistle instead. Barber's Adagio will also be banned, especially that dreadful dance music version by William Orbit. This will mean long periods of silence on Classic FM, but we all have our crosses to bear. Expulsions We are sorry that some innocent individuals will be caught up in this imbroglio, but frankly you started this. When that rich bloke appointed ambassador by Bush arrives, he should be detained on arrival, frisked at Heathrow, Diana Ross-style and then sent back on an economy flight via New Delhi. All US embassy staff above second secretary level will be expelled; they're probably just spying on the Russians anyway. Ruby Wax, Paul Gambaccini and Loyd Grossman will also have to go. Madonna can stay as long as she can persuade Guy Ritchie to stop making gangster films (better still, any films). Bob Kiley can definitely stay, ideally becoming mayor of London and/or secretary of state for transport in 2003. Withdrawals All of the following will be asked to leave the US: Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Ridley Scott, Catherine Zeta Jones (and Michael Douglas if he wants to leave), Tina Brown, Lisa Snowdon (3), Amanda de Cadenet, Christopher Hitchens and Frank McCourt. Salman Rushdie will be asked to speed up his move and make radio broadcasts on the awfulness of life in New York. (4) Apparel Obviously, as the prime minister would say, we will no longer buy anything from Gap, especially those shapeless blue tops that schoolchildren wear instead of uniforms. Tommy Hilfiger is also banned, not that we could afford any of his stuff anyway. Ditto DKNY, whoever they might be. All Calvin Klein clothes are banned with the exception of underwear. Nike trainers are permitted because they are made in the developing world, but people will be encouraged to scrawl graffiti over the company's ads. We will insist on the removal of the Union Jack from all Reebok trainers. Baseball caps may not be worn, especially by prominent political figures. Anyone wearing them back to front will be interned. Coffee It is probably too late to stage a boycott of US-style coffee bars as they account for some 40% of British GDP, so we will need to employ guerrilla tactics. When using Starbucks, refuse to say \"tall\", \"grande\", \"vente\", or any of the other silly names. Say small, medium and large in a posh, supercilious voice. If the pony-tailed assistant encourages you to have a good day, push a full-fat blueberry muffin into his/her face. If newspapers are available on the premises, spread the pages over the floor and all the tables. Never under any circumstances buy in-store mugs, games or CDs. Cars Vehicles made by Ford and General Motors will be banned. That will have the useful side effect of relieving traffic jams in the UK, showing what really can be achieved to counter pollution. Restitution Obviously, we want London Bridge and the Queen Mary back. France insists on the return of all Renoirs. The Netherlands is happy for the US to keep its Van Go's, but it would definitely like its Van Goghs back. Germany says the US can keep its paintings, but can no longer perform Wagner at the Met. Britain will go to the UN to reclaim Virginia, which was never formally ceded by George III and still belongs to the family of Lord Fairfax. We might as well take Florida too, given that so many Brits go there on holiday. (5) Disneyland will be dismantled and Mickey Mouse memorabilia sent to the Taliban for safe-keeping. The US will also be banned from using our copyrighted place names. New York, Boston, Birmingham (Alabama) and Manchester (New Hampshire) must be erased from all maps, or there will be real trouble. Language Nothing can henceforth be described as \"cool\". \"Dude\", \"man\" and \"babe\" are also proscribed. Trick or treating will be banned. There can be no references to Thanksgiving, the Fourth of July, or Superbowl.

Notes (1) We think it had something to do with New Mexico, but invite contributions to Corrections and Clarifications. (2) Of course people will opt for prison, but it is important to provide alternatives. (3) George Clooney's girlfriend. Annoy George and you annoy America. (4) It is important that no one tells Phil Collins about the policy of selective withdrawal. It should also be said that Amanda de Cadenet was a close call.

The statement said: \"It will be some while before the extent of her recovery can be determined.

There have been repeated suggestions that she has become confused and reclusive, deeply depressed about her health and that she has even lost the will to live, refusing to eat and often bed-ridden. Princess Margaret suffered a nervous breakdown in the 1970s and has been treated for depression by Mark Collins, a psychiatrist from the Priory Clinic, which treats wealthy celebrities. She has been distressed by her slow recovery from the scalding and has undertaken few engagements or public appearances in the past year. She was most recently seen a fortnight ago, walking with the aid of a stick to attend a private dinner party at a West End restaurant.

      "body": "<p>On a warm Balkan Sunday morning 18 months ago the Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, his wife Danica, her brother, and five other friends set out from Belgrade for a day in the country.</p> <p>Their convoy of three cars headed for Ravna Gora, the hilltop shrine of Draza Mihailovic, the second world war Serbian guerrilla leader who is Mr Draskovic's idol. An hour's drive from the capital, near the town of Valjevo, a Mercedes lorry approaching from the opposite direction suddenly lurched into their path.</p> <p>The collision sent Mr Draskovic's Audi spinning over the verge into a field, the lorry shearing off the driver's side of the car. His brother-in-law, Veselin Boskovic, who was driving, died half an hour later. The BMW behind the Audi crashed head-on into the lorry and the three men in it died instantly.</p> <p>The lorry driver was unhurt and made a prompt getaway.</p> <p>\"I thought of nothing but surviving,\" Mr Draskovic says. \"It was hell. My friends were dead and I was only slightly injured. Then the reality dawns on you, that you're living in a state of killers, that your country is commanded by monsters.\"</p> <p>The crash is now being investigated as an attempted assassination by former president Slobodan Milosevic's regime.Today, six months after Mr Milosevic was deposed, the new Serbian authorities are close to bringing charging Rade Markovic, the regime's secret police chief, and a clutch of others, with murder. The charge carries the death penalty.</p> <p>Milan Radonjic, head of the Belgrade secret police under Mr Milosevic, is in custody, together with Mr Markovic, Nenad Ilic, a lorry driver and state security employee, and Nenad Bujosevic, another secret police officer, who is said to have been in an escort car directing the lorry to the crash.</p> <p><b> Gunned down</b><br></p> <p>It is one of several prominent cases of political murder being laid at the door of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>Mr Markovic is also expected to be charged with the murder of Slavko Curuvija, an opposition newspaper editor shot dead outside his Belgrade home in April 1999, two weeks after the Kosovan war began.</p> <p>Branka Prpa, the journalist's widow, who looked on as her husband was gunned down by her side, was interviewed by detectives last November for the first time, 19 months after the killing.</p> <p>\"It was a farce,\" she says. \"This was a political decision, a political murder. And in that system, Markovic can't decide that on his own. Milosevic is responsible, of course. In that pyramid, he was the peak.\"</p> <p>Many in the new Serbian and Yugoslav governments agree, and are scrambling to amass the witnesses and evidence needed to blame the political violence not only on his henchmen, but on the former president himself.</p> <p>There are several other cases, including Ivan Stambolic, and Zeljko Raznjatovic, better known as Arkan, the notorious warlord and gangster, who was shot dead last year.</p> <p>Mr Stambolic is a former president of Serbia and was best man at Mr Milosevic's wedding. In August last year, in the run-up to the September elections, he was abducted while jogging in Belgrade. He was bundled into a car and has not been heard of since.</p> <p>Until 1987, when Mr Milosevic turned ruthlessly on Mr Stambolic, the two men were inseparable, the closest of friends, but by last year Mr Stambolic was a fierce critic of his former colleague.</p> <p>\"It is impossible in this country that Stambolic disappeared and no one high up in the state knew anything about it,\" says Goran Vesic, a senior official in the Yugoslav interior ministry.</p> <p>\"That case is in hand, but we don't know very much.\"</p> <p>Arkan was murdered at the Intercontinental Hotel in Belgrade just over a year ago, allegedly because he knew too much about the regime's nefarious doings in the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovan wars. New evidence is emerging to support the long-held suspicionthat Arkan was executed on the orders of the state.</p> <p>But Mr Markovic, the secret police chief, was not arrested until February, and President Vojislav Kostunica kept him in office until January, which would have allowed Mr Markovic more than three months after Mr Milosevic's fall to destroy incriminating files.</p> <p>\"I couldn't understand that - guilty yet still in power,\" says Ms Prpa. \"I was shocked when I saw Markovic on TV, still in office.\"</p> <p>Mr Draskovic accuses the new government of reluctance to pursue his alleged assassins to the very top. \"Kostunica publicly protected Markovic and he has to explain why. But Markovic saw Milosevic every day. It's ridiculous. They say they can't find evidence against Milosevic. They're throwing sand in people's eyes.\"</p> <p>The evidence against the state in the Draskovic and Curuvija cases is growing stronger.

      "bodyText": "On a warm Balkan Sunday morning 18 months ago the Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, his wife Danica, her brother, and five other friends set out from Belgrade for a day in the country. Their convoy of three cars headed for Ravna Gora, the hilltop shrine of Draza Mihailovic, the second world war Serbian guerrilla leader who is Mr Draskovic's idol. An hour's drive from the capital, near the town of Valjevo, a Mercedes lorry approaching from the opposite direction suddenly lurched into their path. The collision sent Mr Draskovic's Audi spinning over the verge into a field, the lorry shearing off the driver's side of the car. His brother-in-law, Veselin Boskovic, who was driving, died half an hour later. The BMW behind the Audi crashed head-on into the lorry and the three men in it died instantly. The lorry driver was unhurt and made a prompt getaway. \"I thought of nothing but surviving,\" Mr Draskovic says. \"It was hell. My friends were dead and I was only slightly injured. Then the reality dawns on you, that you're living in a state of killers, that your country is commanded by monsters.\" The crash is now being investigated as an attempted assassination by former president Slobodan Milosevic's regime.Today, six months after Mr Milosevic was deposed, the new Serbian authorities are close to bringing charging Rade Markovic, the regime's secret police chief, and a clutch of others, with murder. The charge carries the death penalty. Milan Radonjic, head of the Belgrade secret police under Mr Milosevic, is in custody, together with Mr Markovic, Nenad Ilic, a lorry driver and state security employee, and Nenad Bujosevic, another secret police officer, who is said to have been in an escort car directing the lorry to the crash. Gunned down It is one of several prominent cases of political murder being laid at the door of the Milosevic regime. Mr Markovic is also expected to be charged with the murder of Slavko Curuvija, an opposition newspaper editor shot dead outside his Belgrade home in April 1999, two weeks after the Kosovan war began. Branka Prpa, the journalist's widow, who looked on as her husband was gunned down by her side, was interviewed by detectives last November for the first time, 19 months after the killing. \"It was a farce,\" she says. \"This was a political decision, a political murder. And in that system, Markovic can't decide that on his own. Milosevic is responsible, of course. In that pyramid, he was the peak.\" Many in the new Serbian and Yugoslav governments agree, and are scrambling to amass the witnesses and evidence needed to blame the political violence not only on his henchmen, but on the former president himself. There are several other cases, including Ivan Stambolic, and Zeljko Raznjatovic, better known as Arkan, the notorious warlord and gangster, who was shot dead last year. Mr Stambolic is a former president of Serbia and was best man at Mr Milosevic's wedding. In August last year, in the run-up to the September elections, he was abducted while jogging in Belgrade. He was bundled into a car and has not been heard of since. Until 1987, when Mr Milosevic turned ruthlessly on Mr Stambolic, the two men were inseparable, the closest of friends, but by last year Mr Stambolic was a fierce critic of his former colleague. \"It is impossible in this country that Stambolic disappeared and no one high up in the state knew anything about it,\" says Goran Vesic, a senior official in the Yugoslav interior ministry. \"That case is in hand, but we don't know very much.\" Arkan was murdered at the Intercontinental Hotel in Belgrade just over a year ago, allegedly because he knew too much about the regime's nefarious doings in the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovan wars. New evidence is emerging to support the long-held suspicionthat Arkan was executed on the orders of the state. But Mr Markovic, the secret police chief, was not arrested until February, and President Vojislav Kostunica kept him in office until January, which would have allowed Mr Markovic more than three months after Mr Milosevic's fall to destroy incriminating files. \"I couldn't understand that - guilty yet still in power,\" says Ms Prpa. \"I was shocked when I saw Markovic on TV, still in office.\" Mr Draskovic accuses the new government of reluctance to pursue his alleged assassins to the very top. \"Kostunica publicly protected Markovic and he has to explain why. But Markovic saw Milosevic every day. It's ridiculous. They say they can't find evidence against Milosevic. They're throwing sand in people's eyes.\" The evidence against the state in the Draskovic and Curuvija cases is growing stronger. The Mercedes lorry was confiscated from its owner in 1996 by Mr Milosevic's customs service and was then included in the pool of civilian vehicles the secret police used for its operations. Faked documents Mihalj Kertes, a key figure in the regime who headed Mr Milosevic's secret police before running the customs, then falsified the lorry's registration papers after the crash to make it appear that the vehicle belonged to a Kosovan Serb electricity company. On the day of the crash, the police, including Belgrade's police chief, were at the scene faster than the ambulances, and the lorry driver was instantly spirited away. Petar Rajic, a state security officer, leaked inside information on the crash to Mr Draskovic before himself being killed in a car crash in November 1999. The lorry driver has told investigators that he was following Mr Markovic's orders, while Mr Kertes has also admitted faking the vehicle papers on orders from the secret police chief. And the investigation into the Curuvija murder has produced apparent proof that the editor was under round-the-clock surveillance by three teams of nine state security agents, but the surveillance was called off 15 minutes before he was shot. Mr Milosevic's key propaganda outlets, state television and the newspaper Politika, effectively announced Curuvija's death sentence a few days before he was murdered, declaring publicly to the nation that the editor was a traitor beholden to the Nato bombers attacking Belgrade at the time. \"The Curuvija case against Markovic is almost complete. We're close to bringing charges,\" says Mr Vesic. \"As for Kertes, we've got enough against him to put him away for a long time. But he will be cooperative on Milosevic.\" If Mr Kertes is singing, as they say in Belgrade, Mr Markovic is said to be saying nothing in custody. He was despised inside his service as a rather dim-witted man who, as a career policeman, became the first outsider to head the secret police in 1998 at the behest of Mr Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic (no relation to Mr Markovic). \"The state security service,\" she said last week, \"is a rather independent institution. It often seems to lack information. \"I had no contact with past state security leaders. But I doubt if the service had anything to do with the Ibarska [Draskovic] road crash or with Slavko Curuvija.\"",

They show Slobodan Milosevic lighting a cigar with, behind him, war damage, empty supermarket shelves, scenes of police brutality. This evidence that public opinion is moving, and is being moved, toward accepting that Milosevic must go to the Hague is a reminder of how much has changed in the Balkans. One has only to ask the question of what would have happened in Macedonia had Milosevic still been in power in Belgrade to see how critically important his fall has been. Had he still been manipulating events, as a Serbian journalist put it with utter conviction, arms and encouragement would be on its way to one or both sides, and \"Macedonia would already be burning\".</p> <p>It would be an exaggeration to say that the country feels it has shot overnight from being on probation to being \"America's ally now\" as one newspaper headline put it when Serbian troops moved back into a section of the previously demilitarised zone at the junction of the Serbian, Kosovan, and Macedonian borders. But it is undoubtedly true that Serbia has done Nato and, in particular the United States, a sort of favour. Some Serbs relish the fact that this has happened just before an American deadline for cutting off aid comes due this weekend. The Serbian authorities had already moved to meet some of the conditions which the US Congress laid down for continuing aid, although they have refused to be hurried on the arrest and trial of Milosevic, the prelude to his eventual extradition to the Hague. But as they work toward a Milosevic arrest, \"Greater Kosovo\", whether in Macedonia or in the Presevo valley, has become, for Serbia, an asset in dealing with the west.</p> <p>As soon as Milosevic went there were those who rightly argued that what had to be avoided was a premature rehabilitation of a Serbia which had changed but which had not changed enough. Western countries, anxious to reduce the military, financial and moral burden they carry in this region, might be tempted to fall on Serbia's neck. It remains true that this would be a development dangerous for two different, but related reasons. First, even a residual or sentimental Greater Serbia policy can still damage the whole region, obstructing changes in the status of Montenegro and Kosovo, and undermining attempts to make Bosnia a more integrated society. This would be particularly the case if western caution coincides with what Serbia might perceive to be its interests. Secondly, Serbia's own future as a normal society would be threatened if it does not part company as completely as possible not just with the methods but with the aims, the personnel, and the mentality of the Milosevic years.</p> <p>It has to be said, in considering such vital questions, that both President Vojislav Kostunica and Prime Minister Zoran Djindic are, in spite of their admitted virtues, less than ideal leaders - Kostunica because of his own nationalist leanings and Djindic because of his pragmatic tendency to close the books on the mess that is Serbia's recent past without too many questions, judgments, or punishments. Kostunica, president of an imaginary federation, has few powers and thus concerns himself with symbols, railing at the Hague, reaching out to the Serbian Orthodox Church, even to the old monarchy, and to Serbs outside the state, especially those in Bosnia. Wherever anything has some nationalist appeal, Kostunica, an advocate of what is called \"moderate nationalism\" or \"new patriotism\", seems to want to annex it to his constituency.</p> <p>Opinion differs as to whether this amounts to any more than a few last tunes on a broken piano, but it can be damaging. For example, the pact Kostunica organised on trade and aid with the Republika Srpska, while within the letter of the Dayton agreement, was not helpful at a time when Croatia was minimising its links with Bosnian Croats.</p> <p>Djindic pays less attention to nationalist symbols. In his far more powerful position, he is dedicated to economic transformation above all other objectives, on the grounds that without it nothing can be achieved or consolidated in Serbia. In his pursuit of the necessary western aid he has moved in on Milosevic, and tried to shape a new approach to the Albanians of southern Serbia. But it may be that his team of able ministers and officials is so concerned with making up for the years they lost in the 90s, when other ex-communist states were re-making their economies and political systems, that it tends to lose sight of the need for Serbia to face up to what it actually did do in that decade, which was to ruin itself and its neighbours.</p> <p>The concentration on Milosevic and a few other villains may reinforce the forgetful tendency. \"Once they lauded Milosevic, now they praise Kostunica,\" the columnist Petar Lukovic wrote of some his fellow journalists, in a recent piece published by the Institute for War and Peace Reporting*. He complains about something not confined to journalism, the survival of compromised men and women in many official positions. Some may continue loyal to the destructive ideas of the past, while others may be no more than cynical dissemblers - but, either way, they must be a bar to real renewal. The other group of dangerous survivors is criminals - not war criminals, although some deserve that name as well, but racketeers and smugglers, beneficiaries of war and social breakdown in Serbia as in other Yugoslav successor states. Lukovic points to another worrying phenomenon, which is that while there is some recognition of war crimes, it is often allied to attempts to question scale and number. He is surely right to argue that a wider purge of the guilty and a deeper examination of recent history are both necessary and connected.</p> <p>There are diplomats in Belgrade who believe, as one put it, that Serbia has moved from being the problem in the Balkans to being part of the solution. Certainly the latter part of the equation is not yet proven, just as it is not the case that \"the problem\" is now the Albanians. The problem, it might be hazarded, is rather that western states and Balkan states alike have a less than coherent approach to what remains to be done in former Yugoslavia. Fearful of the consequences of forceful change - toughening up in both Bosnia and Kosovo, the separation of Montenegro, independence accepted as the ultimate goal in Kosovo - they settled instead on a policy of caution and some would say procrastination. Serbia may prefer that policy and have influenced its adoption, but its own future might be better served by the radical approach, which would end with it left alone to face itself without pretensions or pretences.</p> <p>*Institute for War and Peace Reporting Balkan Crisis Report No 220. <br><a href=\"mailto:&quot;info@iwpr.net&quot;\">info@iwpr.net</a></p>",

Western countries, anxious to reduce the military, financial and moral burden they carry in this region, might be tempted to fall on Serbia's neck. It remains true that this would be a development dangerous for two different, but related reasons. First, even a residual or sentimental Greater Serbia policy can still damage the whole region, obstructing changes in the status of Montenegro and Kosovo, and undermining attempts to make Bosnia a more integrated society. This would be particularly the case if western caution coincides with what Serbia might perceive to be its interests. Secondly, Serbia's own future as a normal society would be threatened if it does not part company as completely as possible not just with the methods but with the aims, the personnel, and the mentality of the Milosevic years. It has to be said, in considering such vital questions, that both President Vojislav Kostunica and Prime Minister Zoran Djindic are, in spite of their admitted virtues, less than ideal leaders - Kostunica because of his own nationalist leanings and Djindic because of his pragmatic tendency to close the books on the mess that is Serbia's recent past without too many questions, judgments, or punishments. Kostunica, president of an imaginary federation, has few powers and thus concerns himself with symbols, railing at the Hague, reaching out to the Serbian Orthodox Church, even to the old monarchy, and to Serbs outside the state, especially those in Bosnia. Wherever anything has some nationalist appeal, Kostunica, an advocate of what is called \"moderate nationalism\" or \"new patriotism\", seems to want to annex it to his constituency. Opinion differs as to whether this amounts to any more than a few last tunes on a broken piano, but it can be damaging. For example, the pact Kostunica organised on trade and aid with the Republika Srpska, while within the letter of the Dayton agreement, was not helpful at a time when Croatia was minimising its links with Bosnian Croats. Djindic pays less attention to nationalist symbols. In his far more powerful position, he is dedicated to economic transformation above all other objectives, on the grounds that without it nothing can be achieved or consolidated in Serbia. In his pursuit of the necessary western aid he has moved in on Milosevic, and tried to shape a new approach to the Albanians of southern Serbia. But it may be that his team of able ministers and officials is so concerned with making up for the years they lost in the 90s, when other ex-communist states were re-making their economies and political systems, that it tends to lose sight of the need for Serbia to face up to what it actually did do in that decade, which was to ruin itself and its neighbours. The concentration on Milosevic and a few other villains may reinforce the forgetful tendency. \"Once they lauded Milosevic, now they praise Kostunica,\" the columnist Petar Lukovic wrote of some his fellow journalists, in a recent piece published by the Institute for War and Peace Reporting*. He complains about something not confined to journalism, the survival of compromised men and women in many official positions. Some may continue loyal to the destructive ideas of the past, while others may be no more than cynical dissemblers - but, either way, they must be a bar to real renewal. The other group of dangerous survivors is criminals - not war criminals, although some deserve that name as well, but racketeers and smugglers, beneficiaries of war and social breakdown in Serbia as in other Yugoslav successor states. Lukovic points to another worrying phenomenon, which is that while there is some recognition of war crimes, it is often allied to attempts to question scale and number. He is surely right to argue that a wider purge of the guilty and a deeper examination of recent history are both necessary and connected. There are diplomats in Belgrade who believe, as one put it, that Serbia has moved from being the problem in the Balkans to being part of the solution. Certainly the latter part of the equation is not yet proven, just as it is not the case that \"the problem\" is now the Albanians. The problem, it might be hazarded, is rather that western states and Balkan states alike have a less than coherent approach to what remains to be done in former Yugoslavia. Fearful of the consequences of forceful change - toughening up in both Bosnia and Kosovo, the separation of Montenegro, independence accepted as the ultimate goal in Kosovo - they settled instead on a policy of caution and some would say procrastination. Serbia may prefer that policy and have influenced its adoption, but its own future might be better served by the radical approach, which would end with it left alone to face itself without pretensions or pretences. *Institute for War and Peace Reporting Balkan Crisis Report No 220. info@iwpr.net",

The shares have fallen more than 50% so far on the year with investors betting on a profit warning to come in the fallout from a weakening US economy.

The figure compares with \u00a313.2bn at the end of the half year in October and the company's promise to reduce it to \u00a310bn or less by the end of the financial year. The new debt forecast was accompanied by news that Vodafone had completed the sale of Italian operator Infostrada to Enel. </p> <p>Shares in <strong> ARC International</strong>, the specialist chip designer, were down 9.5p to 98.5p after analysts at investment bank UBS Warburg revised upwards their loss estimate for the group in 2001 from \u00a320.6m before interest and tax to \u00a327.4m. The increase reflected higher costs in sales and marketing and increased spending on research. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> took the market by surprise and saw its shares rise 17.5p to 266.5p after announcing it was selling much of its non-core business, cutting more than 4,000 jobs and planning to return \u00a32bn to shareholders by March 2002. </p> <p> <strong> Selfridges</strong>, however, saw no change despite announcing it would open its second store in the Manchester area by acquiring half the floorspace in Marks &amp; Spencer's recently rebuilt city centre outlet.

About 100 manufacturing jobs are to be lost in Britain after the company decided to close its steering-gear plant in Southampton. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for the US com Hampshire plant would be transferred to Poland. The cuts are the largest since the early 1990s, when a downturn in the US prompted a similar wave of redundancies. Several other large companies have announced layoffs in the past few weeks. Dow Jones, the media company, said that it intended to cut some of the 250 jobs at WSJ.com, the website for its flagship newspaper, the Wall Street Journal. A spokeswoman for the company said that the redundancies at one of the few subscription-based websites would be limited. Delphi said that the slowing US market, which accounts for 70% of the company's sales, had been the biggest cause of the retrenchment. General Motors, Delphi's biggest customer and former parent, has also announced layoffs and plant closures in recent months. Delphi, which has 190 manufacturing plants in 31 countries, also issued a profits warning yesterday, forecasting a net loss of up to $50m in the first quarter before a $400m restructuring charge. Forecast first-quarter revenues are between $6.4bn and $6.5bn, about $150m below expectation. About $900m of the company's businesses are to be closed following a company-wide review.

      "bodyText": "The Italian agriculture minister, Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, ordered checks on 21 Italian seed companies yesterday after seizing soya bean and maize seed imported by the US biotech company Monsanto on the grounds that it contained traces of genetically modified material. Mr Pecoraro Scanio has also asked the regional authorities in Milan to suspend Monsanto's seed import licence. \"The possible illegal emission of genetically modified organisms in the fields could cause very serious environmental and economic damage,\" said Mr Pecoraro Scanio, a Green party member and an opponent of GM foods. \"To prevent is always better than to repair damage.\" Officials of the Italian Seed Association, whose members will be subjected to the checks ordered yesterday, which will be made by farm police and fraud investigators, wrote to Mr Pecoraro Scanio in October saying it was impossible to guarantee seeds free of GM material. Jean-Michel Duhamel, managing director of a Monsanto subsidiary in Lodi, said that if the authorities found traces of genetic material in deposits of rival seed firms, they too could be threatened with having their import licences suspended. On Wednesday the Italian police began seizing 300 tonnes of soya seed suspected of containing genetic material which Monsanto had distributed to retailers. They had already seized 112 tonnes of maize from Monsanto's warehouse in Lodi. Testing of maize from Monsanto revealed the presence of the banned GM Monsanto strain Mon 810, a health ministry official said. Mr Duhamel said the maize could contain minimal traces of Mon 810, but it conformed with the regulations. An official familiar with the seizures of Monsanto grain said EU laws were unclear on how to tackle cases where grain was found to contain genetic material. It was up to individual governments to decide how to proceed in such cases, he added.",

The helicopter gunship attack on Force 17 in Ramallah has confirmed the unit's reputation as the most elite of the dozen or so security organisations in the West Bank and Gaza. Underlining the point, Mr Arafat left his helicopter yesterday and marched directly toward a Force 17 honour guard, clad in olive uniforms and black berets. As he saluted, a ban played the Palestinian anthem. Mr Arafat said that the intifada would continue \"until the Palestinian flag is raised on the walls, churches and mosques of holy Jerusalem\". In recent days the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has regularly blamed Force 17 - and by extension Mr Arafat himself - for drive-by shootings at Jewish settlers, and indirectly for the bombing attacks in Israel which have been claimed by militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Earlier this month Israeli army officers said they had established a link between the commander of Force 17 in the West Bank, and the roadside ambushes which killed eight Jewish motorists along the main route between Jerusalem and Ramallah. In the Gaza Strip, the Israelis accuse Force 17 of mounting mortar attacks. On February 14 Israeli helicopter gunships fired a volley of rockets at a the car of a Force 17 colonel in the Gaza Strip, the second member of the force to be assassinated. Another member of the force was shot dead by Israeli forces in clashes in the Gaza Strip yesterday in which two Palestinian teenagers also died. Force 17 emerged in the mid-1970s and takes its name from the telephone extension of its founder, Ali Hassan Salameh, in the Palestinian headquarters in the Fak'hani district of west Beirut.

When Mr Arafat returned to Gaza in 1994, 300 Force 17 fighters came too, and this nucleus of battle-hardened veterans from Lebanon remains the core of the militia, believed to number 3,500. Mahmoud Damara, the low-profile chief of Mr Arafat's presidential guard in Ramallah, describes his men as the \"first circle of defence around the Palestinian leader\". \"The Israelis have clearly targeted President Arafat and Force 17,\" Mr Damara said yesterday as he stood besides the unit's flattened buildings. \"But we expect anything from them.

Mr Damara denies any such role. \"Our duty is to defend the president,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. But, despite Force 17's reputation, many of the new recruits are of a far lower calibre than Israel imagines. Outside a branch office of Force 17 in neighbouring Beituniya yesterday, there was a single sentry: Ibrahim al-Nafar, a scrawny 18-year-old in plain clothes. The Gazan youth, who is paid \u00a3160 a month plus room and board, said he was left behind when his comrades were told to disperse for fear of Israeli follow-up attacks.

It has asked the meteorological department to examine the technique of spraying charcoal on to the glaciers to melt the ice and provide much needed water for crops. Engineers have already ruled out the idea of melting them with lasers. Riaz Ahmed Khan, chairman of the federal flood commission, said the charcoal survey was in its early stages. \"We have to see that it does not destabilise the glaciers,\" he added. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges, which meet in northern Pakistan, are the greatest concentration of high mountains in the world. Pakistan has five 8,000m (26,246ft) peaks, including K2, the world's second highest mountain. With little rainfall in the past three years and its biggest reservoirs virtually dry, Pakistan will have only half the amount of water it normally uses for crops and drinking until June. Across the border in Afghanistan drought has pushed 1m people to the brink of starvation and forced more than 500,000 to leave their homes in search of water. Pakistan has already tried to avert the crisis by cloud seeding. \"The drought is much worse than last year, and that is why we have taken these contingency plans,\" Mr Khan said. Farmers have been told to switch to crops that need less water and, in some areas, rice farming has been banned. The sugarcane, rice and cotton crops have been badly affected, and more than a third of this year's wheat crop has beenlost. Economists believe the poor wheat crop alone could badly reduce economic growth this year. Pakistan is still heavily reliant on agriculture.

Six lorries carrying the first waste returned to Germany from France since 1997 took just over an hour to cover the 12 miles from the rail terminal in Dannenberg to Gorleben, south-west of Hamburg. Police and border guards kept the protesters at bay with a final massive show of force, using armoured car escorts and unmuzzled dogs to thwart their planned blockades. The dash allowed the government to enter two crucial parliamentary debates with the operation completed. At the end of one debate, the Green environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, survived a vote of no confidence. Earlier protests delayed the cargo's arrival by 24 hours and tied down 20,000 police officers along the 375-mile route. The police estimated the cost of the security at \u00a335m. The protesters said their operation was a success. The vitrified waste from recycled fuel rods will be kept in a Gorleben warehouse until the government decides how it should be stored permanently, possibly in a nearby salt mine.",

A lower court awarded the women 300,000 yen (\u00a31,700), but they appealed on the grounds that the settlement was too low. The government also appealed, on the grounds that all claims on the state were settled in postwar peace treaties.

Bacon rolls eaten in laybys are part of a glorious vanished past.</p> <p><b>Follow that van: some roadside favourites</b></p> <p><b> Ilkley</b><br><br> The Rasta-run burger bar just outside Ilkley, West Yorkshire, in the first layby on the Addingham road. If not there, it is usually in the first layby after the Addingham roundabout. The speciality is Afro-Caribbean jerk chicken but there are plenty of burgers too.<br><b> MW</b></p> <p><b>Bradford</b><br><br> The Canal Road burger bar, just by Dickenson's caravans is there most days, catering mostly for trucks (ample parking) and very busy on Bradford City home match days. Excellent burgers and fry-ups of all descriptions are served from a counter on a big trailer. Fantastic value. <br><b> MW </b></p> <p><b>Glasgow</b><br><br> There's a van run by an old guy at the top of Lynedoch Street that's been there for donkey's years. From the outside, the dilapidated blue transit van does not inspire confidence. But one breakfast was all it took to convert me: two of the classic sausage and egg rolls with brown sauce and a cup of scalding hot strong tea - a reminder of what good Scottish cuisine should be about.<br><b> SM </b></p> <p><b>Oxford</b><br><br> Most traffic hurtles past my favourite roadside fry-up stand at 70 or more, leaning into the sudden bend that rushes them up this last stretch of dual carriageway before the M40 and the big roundabout for the Oxford road. It has got the lot, this, underneath its hinged awning: eggs any way, sausage, old-fashioned burgers and builders' tea. There is camaraderie here that I would miss if it went: a kind of On The Road/full leather jacket feel you just do not get at the Little Chefs and Happy Eaters. It is a part of the fabric of an alternative English landscape, and I hope it stays. <br><b> JG </b></p> <p><b>Leeds</b><br><br> There's a burger famine until September at Leeds University because building work has squeezed out the Uni Burger Van which always lurks outside the student union on gig nights. Regulars say its chips are worth waiting five months for. Meanwhile, try the van on Woodhouse Lane between Leeds Metropolitan University and the Drydock pub-in-a-barge. <br><b> MW </b></p> <p><b>Cambridge</b><br><br> Its official title is Mister Burger, but the burger van run by husband and wife Nick and Angela in the centre of Market Square in Cambridge goes by many names. Depending on your opinion of the food it is also called The Van of Life, The Mobile Death Van or Not The One Run By The Armenians On The Other Side Of The Square. Staff focus on the personal touch, greeting customers by name and remembering their usual order. The culinary highlight is the Pound Burger Challenge, which involves trying to beat the speed-eating record of a monster burger made up of four quarter pound patties. <br><b>JC</b></p>",

This response emerged after a high-level pow-wow lasting several hours. We dismissed it as \"generic and non-specific\" after a low-level pow-wow lasting several seconds. Sadly, the survey may have come too late for many of these romantic roadside eateries. They are virtually impossible to find in central London - Westminster council bans them and Camden only allows them on private land - and their natural habitat, the A road, has been eaten away by the growth of the motorway network. Councils dislike them because, being mobile, they are hard to police, and the tradition of pottering along A roads has been undermined by the absurd notion that the whole point of travel is rapid transit from A to B. Bacon rolls eaten in laybys are part of a glorious vanished past. Follow that van: some roadside favourites Ilkley The Rasta-run burger bar just outside Ilkley, West Yorkshire, in the first layby on the Addingham road. If not there, it is usually in the first layby after the Addingham roundabout. The speciality is Afro-Caribbean jerk chicken but there are plenty of burgers too. MW Bradford The Canal Road burger bar, just by Dickenson's caravans is there most days, catering mostly for trucks (ample parking) and very busy on Bradford City home match days. Excellent burgers and fry-ups of all descriptions are served from a counter on a big trailer. Fantastic value. MW Glasgow There's a van run by an old guy at the top of Lynedoch Street that's been there for donkey's years. From the outside, the dilapidated blue transit van does not inspire confidence. But one breakfast was all it took to convert me: two of the classic sausage and egg rolls with brown sauce and a cup of scalding hot strong tea - a reminder of what good Scottish cuisine should be about. SM Oxford Most traffic hurtles past my favourite roadside fry-up stand at 70 or more, leaning into the sudden bend that rushes them up this last stretch of dual carriageway before the M40 and the big roundabout for the Oxford road. It has got the lot, this, underneath its hinged awning: eggs any way, sausage, old-fashioned burgers and builders' tea. There is camaraderie here that I would miss if it went: a kind of On The Road/full leather jacket feel you just do not get at the Little Chefs and Happy Eaters. It is a part of the fabric of an alternative English landscape, and I hope it stays. JG Leeds There's a burger famine until September at Leeds University because building work has squeezed out the Uni Burger Van which always lurks outside the student union on gig nights. Regulars say its chips are worth waiting five months for. Meanwhile, try the van on Woodhouse Lane between Leeds Metropolitan University and the Drydock pub-in-a-barge. MW Cambridge Its official title is Mister Burger, but the burger van run by husband and wife Nick and Angela in the centre of Market Square in Cambridge goes by many names. Depending on your opinion of the food it is also called The Van of Life, The Mobile Death Van or Not The One Run By The Armenians On The Other Side Of The Square. Staff focus on the personal touch, greeting customers by name and remembering their usual order. The culinary highlight is the Pound Burger Challenge, which involves trying to beat the speed-eating record of a monster burger made up of four quarter pound patties. JC",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Marcia Gay Harden's boxy apartment, overlooking the ocean in Venice, California, looks like a dressing room on opening night. Four days after she being nominated as best supporting actress for her performance in the film Pollock - as Lee Krasner, artist wife of Jackson Pollock, the crazed American abstract expressionist painter who died in a car crash in 1956 - the phone never stops trilling. Every available surface is crowded with floral arrangements from producers, agents and industry honchos. The bowl of beautiful pink roses and lavender sweet peas is from Winona Ryder, whom Harden doesn't even know. Taped to the front door and over the mantel are full-colour trade-paper ads congratulating her.</p> <p>In a few weeks' time, Harden will beat Kate Hudson, Judi Dench, Julie Walters and Frances McDormand to the Academy award. But at this stage, with the ceremony looming, she is preoccupied with the wall art. She gets up from her brown leather couch and begins pulling down the makeshift banners. \"Thad? Honey?\" Harden called out to Thaddaeus Scheel, her husband of six years. \"I'm taking my shrine down.\" </p> <p>Apparently, the presence of the altar has something to do with Harden's busy schedule. When she first heard the big news, she was by herself in a hotel room in Denver on a promotional tour for Pollock. With wet hair and clad in just a bathrobe, she managed to extract a hug from an impassive room service waitress bearing breakfast. Other than that, Harden hasn't had a real chance to celebrate. So Scheel put up the appropriate \"Go Marcia!\" decorations the night before and gave a party, not just for his wife but also for her many close neighbourhood friends, several of whom are seeing to it that everyone within 20 miles of their beach community knows that a potential Oscar winner is in their midst. </p> <p>\"One of my girlfriends here told me, 'Marcia Gay, every person I meet, I just have to tell them - the checkout girl, everybody!'\" says Harden. Suddenly, her husky voice tightens and tears well in her brown eyes. \"As you can probably tell, I'm feeling overly sentimental. There have been so many people from the past, from the present, who are calling, and it's as if they're celebrating a personal victory for themselves.\" </p> <p>A quick look at 41-year-old Harden's filmography helps explain her elation. In 1990, her feature-film debut as a two-timing floozy in the Coen brothers' Prohibition-era gangster drama Miller's Crossing was so silkily confident and original, she seemed destined to land on top of the Hollywood A-list. Instead, she went on to a television movie called Kojak: None So Blind, did a lot of babysitting and found out how hard it is for people to separate buzz from reality. \"Everyone thinks offers are always pouring in,\" she says. \"Offers have never poured in. Never. I was auditioning a lot, but I didn't get the jobs. I had to pay off my school loans, you know?\" </p> <p>Since then, Harden's career trajectory has repeated the highs and lows of her first year. Often, you'll find her offering brief rays of light in mainstream duds like Desperate Measures and Meet Joe Black. Or she'll pop up in an indie gem like The Daytrippers and turn a five-minute cameo as a gin-gulping lonely heart into a highlight. Then, every couple of years, she'll play an ancillary character in a big-budget movie - like in Space Cowboys, where she was the flirty, tech-talking scientist who threw herself at Tommy Lee Jones's ageing astronaut - and all the depth and authenticity she can bring to a part is seen in all its glory. </p> <p>It was an inspired bit of casting to put an actress as talented and underused as Harden in the role of the richly complex Lee Krasner, who was tough and opinionated but who always put the demands and needs of her tormented genius husband before her own. Initially, though, the director of Pollock, Ed Harris, who also took the title role (and received a best actor nomination), wasn't convinced that Harden was his perfect Lee. \"I liked Marcia Gay physically,\" says Harris, who spent roughly 10 years working on the project. \"But Lee wasn't effusive and out there like Marcia Gay. She was very much self-contained.\" He put Harden through several auditions, pounding over the script in what amounted to intensive mini-rehearsals. \"We went through the scenes,\" he says, \"talking and talking about it, really fighting to get Marcia Gay to understand where this woman kept all of her feelings. And she delved pretty deep and really left Marcia Gay behind.\" </p> <p>Left behind everything, that is, except the part of Harden's character that could rise to the challenge of Harris's dramatic forcefulness. This Harris learned about back in 1994, when he and Harden starred in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of Sam Shepard's play Simpatico. \"She was always really alive, really present,\" recalls Harris, who never worried that his impulsive acting style would shift the balance of power in their onstage chemistry. \"If Ed feels something coming on, he just does it,\" Harden says. \"There was this one point in the play where my character wags her finger in his face. Once Ed just lunged forward and bit it. It was so shocking and funny that it brought me to such a halt. Then we both started laughing.\" </p> <p>In Pollock, too, the charged pairing of Harden with Harris is an even one. However much the film dwells on the artist's turbulent life, Pollock isn't a one-man show starring Harris. Krasner, who died in 1984, was a serious painter in her own right. And when her relatives saw Pollock, they were surprised to find just how much room Harden had been given to show Krasner's half of the relationship. </p> <p>\"I thought they were going to make Lee a real supershrew, but they didn't,\" says Rusty Kanokogi, a niece of Krasner's who says she understood her aunt's volatility. \"How can you not be a lunatic when you're with a guy who comes home and pukes on the floor?\" </p> <p>Early in the pre-production stages of Pollock, Harden requested a meeting at Kanokogi's Brooklyn apartment. \"I thought: 'Oh, my goodness. She's going to show up with a chauffeur, a long cigarette holder and be wearing a tiara.' But she was so regular,\" says Kanokogi, who assented when the actress asked if she could roll around in Krasner's single bed in the apartment and who answered dozens of questions about her aunt. By the time filming began on Pollock, Harden had taken painting lessons, read everything she could about Krasner and mastered her subject's Brooklyn accent. The preparation did the trick: Harden has captured her aunt's essence, Kanokogi says. </p> <p>As a child Harden was never confident that acting was her destiny. Asked to cite an early indication of a theatrical tendency, she thinks for a while, then recalls hamming it up for the neighbours when she and her three sisters and brother staged front-porch plays. \"I was always an exhibitionist,\" Harden says. \"I liked it when everyone laughed. But I didn't do plays in high school. I was too nervous.\" </p> <p>Maybe the fact that her father was a navy captain meant Harden was never around long enough to get in with the drama-club crowd. She grew up in Japan, Greece, Germany and all over the United States, forever a new kid in a new town. \"It was horribly embarrassing,\" Harden says. \"My sisters and I wore out-of-date clothing and matching dresses. It was a very strict family, and we were very mindful of our parents' wishes. So what happens is you go to college and then all hell breaks loose.\" </p> <p>In 1989, Harden was appearing as a character called Lucy the Fat Pig in a New York University production. \"Basically, I followed the male lead around, making snorting noises,\" she says. Donna Isaacson, a casting director, was in the audience. \"Now here,\" Isaacson recalls thinking, \"is someone with nerve. She just went with it. There was no holding back.\" Isaacson set up the meeting with the Coen brothers that eventually led to the unknown Harden beating Julia Roberts, Demi Moore and Jennifer Jason Leigh for the female lead in Miller's Crossing. At the time, Harden was studying acting as a graduate student, even though she had already done so at the University of Texas, had done years of summer stock and was rapidly approaching 30. \"I was old to be in grad school,\" Harden says. \"But I wanted to have resonance. I felt like I could get a reaction from an audience, but it didn't feel like anything I did came from deep inside of me.\" </p> <p>Last December, Harden rode an elevator to the top of the World Trade Centre in New York, where she accepted a best supporting actress award for Pollock from the New York Film Critics Circle. \"I loved it!\" Harden says. In 1993, she received a Theatre World award for her performance in Angels in America, and her speech did not go according to plan. \"I was thinking I'd thank people, that it'd be over in two minutes,\" she said. \"But I was so profoundly moved, I started crying. I think it's because my journey has been so tough, you know?\" </p> <p>For the third time in an hour, Harden begins to choke up.

      "bodyText": "Marcia Gay Harden's boxy apartment, overlooking the ocean in Venice, California, looks like a dressing room on opening night. Four days after she being nominated as best supporting actress for her performance in the film Pollock - as Lee Krasner, artist wife of Jackson Pollock, the crazed American abstract expressionist painter who died in a car crash in 1956 - the phone never stops trilling. Every available surface is crowded with floral arrangements from producers, agents and industry honchos. The bowl of beautiful pink roses and lavender sweet peas is from Winona Ryder, whom Harden doesn't even know. Taped to the front door and over the mantel are full-colour trade-paper ads congratulating her. In a few weeks' time, Harden will beat Kate Hudson, Judi Dench, Julie Walters and Frances McDormand to the Academy award. But at this stage, with the ceremony looming, she is preoccupied with the wall art. She gets up from her brown leather couch and begins pulling down the makeshift banners. \"Thad? Honey?\" Harden called out to Thaddaeus Scheel, her husband of six years. \"I'm taking my shrine down.\" Apparently, the presence of the altar has something to do with Harden's busy schedule. When she first heard the big news, she was by herself in a hotel room in Denver on a promotional tour for Pollock. With wet hair and clad in just a bathrobe, she managed to extract a hug from an impassive room service waitress bearing breakfast. Other than that, Harden hasn't had a real chance to celebrate. So Scheel put up the appropriate \"Go Marcia!\" decorations the night before and gave a party, not just for his wife but also for her many close neighbourhood friends, several of whom are seeing to it that everyone within 20 miles of their beach community knows that a potential Oscar winner is in their midst. \"One of my girlfriends here told me, 'Marcia Gay, every person I meet, I just have to tell them - the checkout girl, everybody!'\" says Harden.

      "body": "<p>In Spike Lee's new media satire Bamboozled, Damon Wayans plays Pierre Delacroix, a television producer who creates a minstrel show that exploits racial stereotypes that were shamed off the stage decades before. As the ratings and the money roll in, Delacroix is haunted by a machine from the minstrel era, a late-19th-century \"Jolly Nigger Bank\", in the shape of a grinning black boy, whose metal arm swings backward to deposit a coin in his mouth. The audience may be more haunted by the minstrel show's central stage prop, a huge portal in the form of a thick-lipped, bug-eyed bellboy; performers in black-face enter from backstage through the gaping mouth. </p> <p>Bamboozled's props are dramatic devices intended to shock, deployed to demonstrate Lee's point that African-Americans still suffer from the weight of these stereotypes. Yet these caricatures are hardly products of Lee's imagination. The bank was once a popular toy. The gaping-mouth door was the signature entrance to a chain of \"family\" restaurants in the Pacific Northwest - Coon-Chicken Inn, which flourished for three decades until the late 1950s. Degrading or not, toys like the Jolly Nigger Bank and Coon-Chicken Inn memorabilia (plates, menus, placemats, even straws) are being sought out by avid collectors, most of whom are African-American. </p> <p>No one knows the full extent of the trade in what is termed Black Americana, but prices are soaring. Banished from the consumer market, these once-everyday objects are scarce. Gone is the general disdain for mammy cookie jars, Aunt Jemima dolls and pencils in the form of alligators eating black children - a motif used to promote the early tourist trade in Florida. During the Civil Rights movement, African-Americans felt these objects carried a painful stigma. Yet a decade after Martin Luther King was shot in Memphis in 1968, dealers say black Americans were already beginning to buy the objects that caricatured them. </p> <p>The image of Aunt Jemima, the elephantine mammy figure whose image was emblazoned on a pancake mix, seems to be the most frequently reproduced icon. Paul Jeromack, an art critic and occasional dealer, has dozens of Aunt Jemima cookie jars and similarly themed salt- and pepper-shakers lined up in his storage room just a block from Central Park. Jeromack, who is white, is a minority in this collecting field. He remembers when prices were low. \"In the early 1980s I found a cookie jar in a Madison Avenue gallery and paid the dealer 85 dollars !\" His voice reaches a shriek as he recalls parting with so much money for a object considered just kitsch. \"It was an insane price, and the dealer knew it,\" he says. </p> <p>Today, cookie jars from the now-closed Abington Pottery works in Ohio can sell for $12,000 and rise to twice that. Terracotta-hued Aunt Jemima pitchers from Weller Pottery - Jeromack has at least 10 - can command $1,000 each. </p> <p>Most of the \"authentic\" objects in this field are functional, rather than decorative. Besides pitchers modelled after Aunt Jemima, salt- and pepper-shakers show the full range of old degrading stereotypes. One common variant is the two-sides shakers, which show the lessons of life - on one side of the shakers, a husband and wife are a handsome, well-dressed bride and groom. On the other side, the groom is fat and disgruntled, and the wife is a shrew with a rolling pin. Often the pepper-shaker is a watermelon on the lap of a child (\"piccaninny\") which is the salt-shaker. Another version of the shakers has a young boy for pepper and a white toilet on which he sits for salt. Yet another common product is the mammy peg-board - a wall board with a picture of a mammy, hand to her head, announcing \"I gots to Git\" and the pegs indicating which groceries need to be bought. </p> <p>These household objects \"didn't really become a souvenir market until the late 20th century,\" according to Kenneth W Goings, a professor at Memphis University and author of Mammy and Uncle Mose: Black Collectibles and American Stereotyping. \"When these first emerged, they were objects that you would use, like a pencil, a glass, or a plate. All these objects actually do something. And I believe that it's a way to symbolically own black people, to symbolically have black servants. I think that gave people who owned them a psychic boost, using these objects,\" says Goings, who is black and estimates that blacks now comprise between 70 and 80% of collectors. </p> <p>At a recent visit to the Triple Pier Expo, a weekend market on three vast piers that extend from Manhattan into the Hudson River, an ebony art-deco carving of a slave in relief, reminiscent of the Dying Gaul, was attached by a gold chain to a pipe rack. The price was $275. Flannel and felt mammy dolls at a booth nearby were priced $900. Around the corner, George Darrow, a dealer specialising in antique toys, was selling a Jolly Nigger Bank, a statue of a newsboy and a wind-up celluloid and tin dancing figure attached to a sign with panels that read \"125th Street/Lenox Avenue\" - the historic crossroads of Harlem. \"That came from occupied Japan, 1945,\" says Darrow. \"It's very special.\" And, for what it was, very expensive, at $550. </p> <p>Asked who collects these objects, Darrow winks: \"People who have money.\" Most recently, those people with money have included Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Cosby, Michael Jackson and even the conservative US Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. Spike Lee himself has a collection, out of which he provided pieces for Bamboozled. </p> <p>An urban legend holds, without evidence, that these black collectors buy up the racist Americana in order to destroy it. But it's beyond doubt that prominent black collectors do send buyers to rake through markets around the country. \"They've got pickers,\" said Joe Canada, a dealer in Upper Marlborough, Maryland. </p> <p>Kenneth Goings, who laments that he's priced out of the market now, discovered Black Americana when a friend's father gave him a pair of Aunt Jemima and Uncle Mose salt- and pepper-shakers as a gift. \"Even though I was a historian already teaching African-American history, I never really even knew about the collectibles until I got that pair, and a smoke screen lifted off my eyes. I began to see them everywhere.\" </p> <p>The memorabilia had indeed been everywhere, reaching its height between the 1880s - the end of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when Union troops withdrew from the South - and the outbreak of the second world war. In these decades, the image of the bumbling or cheerful or fearful or lazy \"negro\" was used to sell a wide variety of products in the United States. Cigarettes, soap, shoe polish, Uncle Ben's rice and \"Cream of Wheat\" cereal used clownish black characters and \"black\" grammar in their advertising. Gold Dust Twins Washing Powder featured two \"piccaninnies\", arm in arm, on its box. Sheet music for jazz and blues music was published with illustrations of characters much like those who perform in Bamboozled. As late as 1989, Colgate-Palmolive was producing a toothpaste for sale in Asia called \"Darkie\", which bore the image of a smiling black man. Under pressure, the firm changed the name to \"Darlie\" and the racial characteristics of the man on the box were made ambiguous. \"The buying started in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, it picked up; in the 1990s it caught fire, and now it's out of hand,\" says Joe Canada. </p> <p>The publicity about the collectibles, which came about, in part, because celebrities were buying them, gave a new generation the knowledge that these objects existed, says Kenneth Goings. \"After that, some African-Americans began collecting them as object lessons for their sons and daughters. They wanted to be able to demonstrate to them how previous generations of African-Americans have been treated.\" </p> <p>\"They also want to own a part of their own history - anything depicting people of African descent,\" said Larry Vincent Buster, author of the newly published Art and History of Black Memorabilia. </p> <p>Goings agrees. \"If you look around, there just aren't a lot of objects addressed to African-Americans to start with, in terms of decorative arts. So the black middle class is looking for these objects. A lot of people decorate their homes with them. I can hardly believe that they do. The cookie jars are very, very popular, and like all the members of the middle classes with disposable income, some African-Americans are just into collecting,\" adds Goings. \"A lot of African-Americans are buying reproductions, although they think they're buying originals. They're being bamboozled, they really are.\" He cites the internet as a prime source of such bamboozling. </p> <p>A click on to eBay, the online auction site, shows the range available. Bidding on a mammy memo-holder, a large board with a picture of a mammy holding a pencil, with a memo-pad apron, had risen to $14. Bidding for a wooden dancing figure from the 1940s was starting at $20. A late 19th-century card depicting a black woman washing clothes in an ad for laundry soap was at $515. </p> <p>\"The internet is keeping prices down now,\" said George Darrow. \"You used to have to wait to trip into a barn and knock over a box and find a nice piece. Now you just go online and start hacking.\" </p> <p>So far, concerns about reproductions creeping on to the collectibles market seem greater than any worries about the reintroduction of objects that resurrect old, despised stereotypes. Officially, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - one of the country's oldest black organisations - has criticised the trade in racist memorabilia. Calls to the NAACP's headquarters in Baltimore failed to get a response about the group's current policy. </p> <p>Bamboozled ends with a credit sequence in which the names of those credited for working on the film are flashed, first over footage caricaturing blacks and then over close-ups of Black Americana. Like it or not, Lee seems to be saying, the objects are part of history. Denying or destroying them would be pointless, says the acerbic African-American cultural critic Stanley Crouch, who wants to preserve all historic depictions of blacks. \"The memorabilia gives you a much better understanding of how one set of images of black people was constantly reinforced - the lazy sleeping darkie, the eternal laughter, and on and on.\" </p> <p>Crouch has other candidates for the scrapheap in mind. \"I hope they collect all these rap-music videos and destroy them. These are much more degrading images of black people than any of this other stuff, especially because the videos are made by black people who claim they're the real 'us'. The rappers are the minstrels of today, and nobody seems to be worried about that. That's where Spike Lee copped out in his movie.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Bamboozled is released on April 6.</p>",

Bamboozled's props are dramatic devices intended to shock, deployed to demonstrate Lee's point that African-Americans still suffer from the weight of these stereotypes. Yet these caricatures are hardly products of Lee's imagination. The bank was once a popular toy. The gaping-mouth door was the signature entrance to a chain of \"family\" restaurants in the Pacific Northwest - Coon-Chicken Inn, which flourished for three decades until the late 1950s. Degrading or not, toys like the Jolly Nigger Bank and Coon-Chicken Inn memorabilia (plates, menus, placemats, even straws) are being sought out by avid collectors, most of whom are African-American. No one knows the full extent of the trade in what is termed Black Americana, but prices are soaring. Banished from the consumer market, these once-everyday objects are scarce. Gone is the general disdain for mammy cookie jars, Aunt Jemima dolls and pencils in the form of alligators eating black children - a motif used to promote the early tourist trade in Florida. During the Civil Rights movement, African-Americans felt these objects carried a painful stigma. Yet a decade after Martin Luther King was shot in Memphis in 1968, dealers say black Americans were already beginning to buy the objects that caricatured them. The image of Aunt Jemima, the elephantine mammy figure whose image was emblazoned on a pancake mix, seems to be the most frequently reproduced icon. Paul Jeromack, an art critic and occasional dealer, has dozens of Aunt Jemima cookie jars and similarly themed salt- and pepper-shakers lined up in his storage room just a block from Central Park. Jeromack, who is white, is a minority in this collecting field. He remembers when prices were low. \"In the early 1980s I found a cookie jar in a Madison Avenue gallery and paid the dealer 85 dollars !\" His voice reaches a shriek as he recalls parting with so much money for a object considered just kitsch. \"It was an insane price, and the dealer knew it,\" he says. Today, cookie jars from the now-closed Abington Pottery works in Ohio can sell for $12,000 and rise to twice that. Terracotta-hued Aunt Jemima pitchers from Weller Pottery - Jeromack has at least 10 - can command $1,000 each. Most of the \"authentic\" objects in this field are functional, rather than decorative. Besides pitchers modelled after Aunt Jemima, salt- and pepper-shakers show the full range of old degrading stereotypes. One common variant is the two-sides shakers, which show the lessons of life - on one side of the shakers, a husband and wife are a handsome, well-dressed bride and groom. On the other side, the groom is fat and disgruntled, and the wife is a shrew with a rolling pin. Often the pepper-shaker is a watermelon on the lap of a child (\"piccaninny\") which is the salt-shaker. Another version of the shakers has a young boy for pepper and a white toilet on which he sits for salt. Yet another common product is the mammy peg-board - a wall board with a picture of a mammy, hand to her head, announcing \"I gots to Git\" and the pegs indicating which groceries need to be bought. These household objects \"didn't really become a souvenir market until the late 20th century,\" according to Kenneth W Goings, a professor at Memphis University and author of Mammy and Uncle Mose: Black Collectibles and American Stereotyping. \"When these first emerged, they were objects that you would use, like a pencil, a glass, or a plate. All these objects actually do something. And I believe that it's a way to symbolically own black people, to symbolically have black servants. I think that gave people who owned them a psychic boost, using these objects,\" says Goings, who is black and estimates that blacks now comprise between 70 and 80% of collectors. At a recent visit to the Triple Pier Expo, a weekend market on three vast piers that extend from Manhattan into the Hudson River, an ebony art-deco carving of a slave in relief, reminiscent of the Dying Gaul, was attached by a gold chain to a pipe rack. The price was $275. Flannel and felt mammy dolls at a booth nearby were priced $900. Around the corner, George Darrow, a dealer specialising in antique toys, was selling a Jolly Nigger Bank, a statue of a newsboy and a wind-up celluloid and tin dancing figure attached to a sign with panels that read \"125th Street/Lenox Avenue\" - the historic crossroads of Harlem. \"That came from occupied Japan, 1945,\" says Darrow. \"It's very special.\" And, for what it was, very expensive, at $550. Asked who collects these objects, Darrow winks: \"People who have money.\" Most recently, those people with money have included Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Cosby, Michael Jackson and even the conservative US Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. Spike Lee himself has a collection, out of which he provided pieces for Bamboozled. An urban legend holds, without evidence, that these black collectors buy up the racist Americana in order to destroy it. But it's beyond doubt that prominent black collectors do send buyers to rake through markets around the country. \"They've got pickers,\" said Joe Canada, a dealer in Upper Marlborough, Maryland. Kenneth Goings, who laments that he's priced out of the market now, discovered Black Americana when a friend's father gave him a pair of Aunt Jemima and Uncle Mose salt- and pepper-shakers as a gift. \"Even though I was a historian already teaching African-American history, I never really even knew about the collectibles until I got that pair, and a smoke screen lifted off my eyes. I began to see them everywhere.\" The memorabilia had indeed been everywhere, reaching its height between the 1880s - the end of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when Union troops withdrew from the South - and the outbreak of the second world war. In these decades, the image of the bumbling or cheerful or fearful or lazy \"negro\" was used to sell a wide variety of products in the United States. Cigarettes, soap, shoe polish, Uncle Ben's rice and \"Cream of Wheat\" cereal used clownish black characters and \"black\" grammar in their advertising. Gold Dust Twins Washing Powder featured two \"piccaninnies\", arm in arm, on its box. Sheet music for jazz and blues music was published with illustrations of characters much like those who perform in Bamboozled. As late as 1989, Colgate-Palmolive was producing a toothpaste for sale in Asia called \"Darkie\", which bore the image of a smiling black man. Under pressure, the firm changed the name to \"Darlie\" and the racial characteristics of the man on the box were made ambiguous. \"The buying started in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, it picked up; in the 1990s it caught fire, and now it's out of hand,\" says Joe Canada. The publicity about the collectibles, which came about, in part, because celebrities were buying them, gave a new generation the knowledge that these objects existed, says Kenneth Goings. \"After that, some African-Americans began collecting them as object lessons for their sons and daughters. They wanted to be able to demonstrate to them how previous generations of African-Americans have been treated.\" \"They also want to own a part of their own history - anything depicting people of African descent,\" said Larry Vincent Buster, author of the newly published Art and History of Black Memorabilia. Goings agrees. \"If you look around, there just aren't a lot of objects addressed to African-Americans to start with, in terms of decorative arts. So the black middle class is looking for these objects. A lot of people decorate their homes with them. I can hardly believe that they do. The cookie jars are very, very popular, and like all the members of the middle classes with disposable income, some African-Americans are just into collecting,\" adds Goings. \"A lot of African-Americans are buying reproductions, although they think they're buying originals. They're being bamboozled, they really are.\" He cites the internet as a prime source of such bamboozling. A click on to eBay, the online auction site, shows the range available. Bidding on a mammy memo-holder, a large board with a picture of a mammy holding a pencil, with a memo-pad apron, had risen to $14. Bidding for a wooden dancing figure from the 1940s was starting at $20. A late 19th-century card depicting a black woman washing clothes in an ad for laundry soap was at $515. \"The internet is keeping prices down now,\" said George Darrow. \"You used to have to wait to trip into a barn and knock over a box and find a nice piece. Now you just go online and start hacking.\" So far, concerns about reproductions creeping on to the collectibles market seem greater than any worries about the reintroduction of objects that resurrect old, despised stereotypes. Officially, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - one of the country's oldest black organisations - has criticised the trade in racist memorabilia. Calls to the NAACP's headquarters in Baltimore failed to get a response about the group's current policy. Bamboozled ends with a credit sequence in which the names of those credited for working on the film are flashed, first over footage caricaturing blacks and then over close-ups of Black Americana. Like it or not, Lee seems to be saying, the objects are part of history. Denying or destroying them would be pointless, says the acerbic African-American cultural critic Stanley Crouch, who wants to preserve all historic depictions of blacks. \"The memorabilia gives you a much better understanding of how one set of images of black people was constantly reinforced - the lazy sleeping darkie, the eternal laughter, and on and on.\" Crouch has other candidates for the scrapheap in mind. \"I hope they collect all these rap-music videos and destroy them. These are much more degrading images of black people than any of this other stuff, especially because the videos are made by black people who claim they're the real 'us'. The rappers are the minstrels of today, and nobody seems to be worried about that. That's where Spike Lee copped out in his movie.\" \u0095 Bamboozled is released on April 6.",

      "body": "<p>Pop songs are signposts to the landmarks of your youth. The first single you ever bought, the song that accompanied your first slow dance at a disco, the music that served as a prelude to losing your virginity: everyone's life has a soundtrack. Take it from someone who can't hear Johnny Hates Jazz's \"You've given me, given me/Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams\" without shuddering at the thought of a particularly traumatic school disco. (Thankfully, Johnny Hates Jazz don't get much airplay these days, even on radio stations with \"gold\" in their names). </p> <p>Indeed, if songs weren't so evocative, there would be nothing on BBC2 and Channel 4 on a Saturday night, no Nostalgia TV and remembrance of times past. </p> <p>Now, as a grown-up, I should be of the opinion that music isn't what it used to be, real singers sang real songs back then and today's pop is pap. I should be disdainful of today's youngsters mapping out their existence to Britney Spears and S Club 7. Of course, I'm not. But more of that later. </p> <p>As the exceptional documentary <strong> Little Women</strong> (BBC2) followed a group of 7 to 12-year-old girls around while they applied glittery make-up, shopped for glittery tops and attempted to replicate the dance moves of popstars in similarly glittery make-up and glittery tops, it examined not just its subject - the media-savvy, choosy and powerful consumers who make up the demographic known as tweenagers - but a change in the whole of society. </p> <p>You could just about guess the ages of Georgia and Leigh, Lauren and Kayleigh, Alex and Jade from their names (it was a bit of a surprise not to find a Kylie among them), but their exploits, attitudes and demeanour were quite misleading, and not to say a bit shocking - presuming you don't know any 10-year-old girls in real life. The girls in Little Women bought clothes in Harrods, watched WWF wrestling on Sky Sports and attended a birthday party at which they demonstrated their duplicated dance moves. One said she was going for a \"biker babe\" look as she donned her leather jacket, another showed off a poster of Luke from Hollyoaks and explained casually how he had been raped, while a third showed the camera her boob tube saying \"It's only fashion, innit.\" Out of the mouths of babes. </p> <p>From a younger and younger age, these girls are being groomed as consumers and, through the likes of Britney, are being fed images to nurture their neuroses and thus their penchant for shopping. Puberty may be impinging on their lives earlier but there is little doubt how much the market is to blame in the ageing of these girls. Resistance to the notion of one's children growing up may be futile, but it nonetheless leaves a sour taste that seven-year-old girls are being sexualised for the benefit of some multi-national cosmetics company. </p> <p>As much as Little Women raised that spectre, it also inadvertently illustrated another fundamental cultural shift. It showed that youth is no longer wasted on the young. As the girls followed S Club 7's prompting and reached for the stars, or discussed make-up and boys, the realisation dawned that in 10 or 20 years time, they will be doing exactly the same thing, albeit clasping a Bacardi Breezer instead of a McDonalds milkshake. (Come to think of it, they probably drink diet Coke.)

      "bodyText": "Pop songs are signposts to the landmarks of your youth. The first single you ever bought, the song that accompanied your first slow dance at a disco, the music that served as a prelude to losing your virginity: everyone's life has a soundtrack. Take it from someone who can't hear Johnny Hates Jazz's \"You've given me, given me/Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams\" without shuddering at the thought of a particularly traumatic school disco. (Thankfully, Johnny Hates Jazz don't get much airplay these days, even on radio stations with \"gold\" in their names). Indeed, if songs weren't so evocative, there would be nothing on BBC2 and Channel 4 on a Saturday night, no Nostalgia TV and remembrance of times past. Now, as a grown-up, I should be of the opinion that music isn't what it used to be, real singers sang real songs back then and today's pop is pap. I should be disdainful of today's youngsters mapping out their existence to Britney Spears and S Club 7. Of course, I'm not. But more of that later. As the exceptional documentary Little Women (BBC2) followed a group of 7 to 12-year-old girls around while they applied glittery make-up, shopped for glittery tops and attempted to replicate the dance moves of popstars in similarly glittery make-up and glittery tops, it examined not just its subject - the media-savvy, choosy and powerful consumers who make up the demographic known as tweenagers - but a change in the whole of society. You could just about guess the ages of Georgia and Leigh, Lauren and Kayleigh, Alex and Jade from their names (it was a bit of a surprise not to find a Kylie among them), but their exploits, attitudes and demeanour were quite misleading, and not to say a bit shocking - presuming you don't know any 10-year-old girls in real life. The girls in Little Women bought clothes in Harrods, watched WWF wrestling on Sky Sports and attended a birthday party at which they demonstrated their duplicated dance moves. One said she was going for a \"biker babe\" look as she donned her leather jacket, another showed off a poster of Luke from Hollyoaks and explained casually how he had been raped, while a third showed the camera her boob tube saying \"It's only fashion, innit.\" Out of the mouths of babes. From a younger and younger age, these girls are being groomed as consumers and, through the likes of Britney, are being fed images to nurture their neuroses and thus their penchant for shopping. Puberty may be impinging on their lives earlier but there is little doubt how much the market is to blame in the ageing of these girls. Resistance to the notion of one's children growing up may be futile, but it nonetheless leaves a sour taste that seven-year-old girls are being sexualised for the benefit of some multi-national cosmetics company. As much as Little Women raised that spectre, it also inadvertently illustrated another fundamental cultural shift. It showed that youth is no longer wasted on the young. As the girls followed S Club 7's prompting and reached for the stars, or discussed make-up and boys, the realisation dawned that in 10 or 20 years time, they will be doing exactly the same thing, albeit clasping a Bacardi Breezer instead of a McDonalds milkshake. (Come to think of it, they probably drink diet Coke.) And the reason I can't ridicule S Club7 is that they are as much one of my cultural references as they are 11-year-old Lauren's. The explosive growth in pop culture has caused a collapse in the differentiation between kid and adult realms of interest. I know 13-year-olds and 45-year-olds who watch Buffy The Vampire Slayer with the same feverish dedication. When Alex says, \"Chocolate and clothes make me happy\", she sounds v Bridget Jones. She is 10 years old. If we're not tweenagers, many of us are kidults. And as kidults, we have the disposable income to indulge childish whims, be they scooters, body glitter or video box sets.

      "body": "<p>In 1977, when the anthropologist Darrell Posey, who has died of a brain tumour aged 53, was offered the opportunity to do field work for his PhD with the Kayapo tribe in Para, in the Brazilian Amazon, he jumped at the chance.</p> <p>In the village of Gorotire, he found a people with a vast knowledge of their forest and savannah environment, based on the complex relationships between plants, animals, people and the soil. It was an ancient tribal culture of exuberance and complexity, with rituals linked to the forest and the cosmos. But it was also a culture under threat - from logging, dams and the queimadas, the vast infernos used to clear forests for conversion into cattle ranches.</p> <p>Darrell realised that, while still an academic, he could not stand by and watch this world being destroyed. He felt compelled to participate in the Kayapo's battles to protect their rainforest home.</p> <p>In one instance, the Gorotire Kayapo acquired a share in a gold mine, and were suddenly in a position to acquire a plane, trucks and a diesel generator. But Darrell was closest to the village traditionalists, the shamans Beptopup and Kuruka, who had taught him Kayapo cosmology, forest management and the use of medicinal plants. He had a deep reverence for these two men, who, he said, taught him more than anybody ever did at university.</p> <p>In 1987, Darrell made his most audacious move, taking two young Kayapo chiefs to the World Bank in Washington to campaign against a series of hydro-electric dams that would flood their land. The visit became headline news. The Brazilian government was not amused, and, on their return, detained all three. But Darrell was only slightly shaken, and continued investigating whether tribes like the Kayapo could make more efficient use of rainforests than modern cattle ranchers.</p> <p>The research concluded that the Kayapo enriched, rather than impoverished, their rainforest habitat by introducing food plants and fruit trees into their forest gardens.

      "bodyText": "In 1977, when the anthropologist Darrell Posey, who has died of a brain tumour aged 53, was offered the opportunity to do field work for his PhD with the Kayapo tribe in Para, in the Brazilian Amazon, he jumped at the chance. In the village of Gorotire, he found a people with a vast knowledge of their forest and savannah environment, based on the complex relationships between plants, animals, people and the soil. It was an ancient tribal culture of exuberance and complexity, with rituals linked to the forest and the cosmos. But it was also a culture under threat - from logging, dams and the queimadas, the vast infernos used to clear forests for conversion into cattle ranches. Darrell realised that, while still an academic, he could not stand by and watch this world being destroyed. He felt compelled to participate in the Kayapo's battles to protect their rainforest home. In one instance, the Gorotire Kayapo acquired a share in a gold mine, and were suddenly in a position to acquire a plane, trucks and a diesel generator. But Darrell was closest to the village traditionalists, the shamans Beptopup and Kuruka, who had taught him Kayapo cosmology, forest management and the use of medicinal plants. He had a deep reverence for these two men, who, he said, taught him more than anybody ever did at university. In 1987, Darrell made his most audacious move, taking two young Kayapo chiefs to the World Bank in Washington to campaign against a series of hydro-electric dams that would flood their land. The visit became headline news. The Brazilian government was not amused, and, on their return, detained all three. But Darrell was only slightly shaken, and continued investigating whether tribes like the Kayapo could make more efficient use of rainforests than modern cattle ranchers. The research concluded that the Kayapo enriched, rather than impoverished, their rainforest habitat by introducing food plants and fruit trees into their forest gardens. He and his co-researchers concluded that some of the great plant variety of the Amazon rainforests was, in fact, put in place by the Amazonian tribes. Born on a farm in Kentucky, Darrell studied at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, taking a BSc in entomology and agriculture, and later a master's degree in geography and anthropology. His PhD was awarded in 1979 from the University of Georgia. Despite his academic credentials, he was sometimes criticised by colleagues who frowned on his involvement with the people he was meant to be studying as a detached observer. Ethno-ecology, the study of the knowledge and traditions of tribal societies in relation to the environment, was, at the time, a new research focus; and academics still find it hard to cope with the idea that tribal people can teach us much about some of the world's most diverse environments, and more specifically, about their food and medicinal plants. In contrast to this approach, Darrell argued that Brazil's strategy for developing the Amazon - primarily by removing the forests wholesale - was one of extraordinary folly. During his years in Brazil, he was largely based at the Amazon research centre at Museo Goldi, Belem, where he continued his ethno-ecological work. In 1989, he founded the International Society for Ethnobiology, which has grown into a major international forum for both indigenous peoples and academics. Its aim is to enable tribal cultures from across over the world to draw attention to their ecological knowledge, and to ensure that this knowledge is protected by intellectual property rights agreements. Darrell played a central role in having these perspectives included in the Biodiversity Convention, agreed at the 1992 Rio summit. There, he also instigated the Earth Parliament, bringing together tribal peoples from all over the world to speak about their plight and the significance of their cultures. After Rio, Darrell made his home in Oxford, as an associate fellow at Linacre College, and research associate at the Oxford Forestry Institute. His most important work was as director of the programme for traditional resource rights at the Oxford Centre for Environment, Ethics and Society, at Mansfield College. But his time there was not easy, and his views were often felt to be a threat by other academics more concerned about their own professional advancement than scientific innovation.

      "bodyText": "An early Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece, which gives the first inkling of his lifelong obsession with making massive equine statues, could make \u00a33.5m when it goes on sale in London in the summer. The silverpoint drawing Horse and Rider, a preparatory study for his first great composition, the unfinished panel, Adoration of the Magi, is the most important work by the renaissance genius still in private hands. It is being sold by the American connoisseur, J Carter Brown, a former director of the US National Gallery in Washington. Leonardo spent a large part of his life attempting to surpass the large-scale equine statues built by the Romans and Greeks. His failure to realise this ambition was one of his major disappointments. Noel Annesley, of Christie's, who will auction the drawing in July, described it as an exquisite masterpiece.",

How sad Labour is likely to win for negative reasons. <br><b>Shirley Haines</b><br> Leeds</p> <p>\u0095 As someone who voted for Liz Davies and her colleagues to help them become NEC members, I would say please come back soon. There is no doubt the Labour government of 1997 was a severe shock to many members and indeed took some decisions even Mrs Thatcher would have shrunk from. But over the last four years they have changed, possibly because of the energies of Liz Davies and others.</p> <p>Mr Brown's Budget was a masterpiece even Denis Healey at the height of his powers would have been proud of. It gave a massive priority to children and their education and still took account of the needs of pensioners. What more could true socialists realistically ask for? Politics requires patience. <br><b>Barry Martin</b><br> Chadlington, Oxon<br><a href=\"mailto:barry@chadlington.fsnet.co.uk\">barry@chadlington.fsnet.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 I had difficulty recognising the 1999 Labour party conference from the image projected by Liz Davies. Certainly, and not before time, inexperienced delegates were afforded whatever help they needed in getting their points across in a succinct and lucid way. Getting up be fore the nation's media in a crowded hall is not easy. And from my soundings, as a constituency delegate, first-time speakers appreciated the support they were given.</p> <p>I spoke in the Northern Ireland debate. No one told me what to say or how to say it. How could they? Once a delegate gets to the rostrum, the floor is his or hers. And short of publicly slandering the chair, it's difficult to shut them up within their allotted time.</p> <p>My recollection of comrades Davies, Willsman and Seddon was of three kids sulking around the nursery refusing to play with the other children because they didn't like the game. The game is called government and the great majority of us in the Labour party like it. <br><b>Cllr Nick Nolan</b> <br>Leader, Coventry council<br> <a href=\"mailto:nick.nolan@coventry.gov.uk\">nick.nolan@coventry.gov.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 It is tiresome for NEC members to be lectured for failing to be sufficiently critical of the government. One compelling reason for a degree of inhibition about debating issues was the reluctance of many members to have their comments and questions leaked to the press and provide material on which to base allegations of damaging splits. Grassroots alliance members were frequently reminded that their propensity to provide colourful accounts of NEC meetings were in this sense counterproductive. <br><b>Cllr Jeremy Beecham</b> <br>Leader, Labour group, Local Government Association</p> <p>\u0095 Perhaps Liz Davies now understands how many of us felt when the party we loved was taken over by the Militants and Bennites in the 70s and 80s. We stayed, we won, we were elected. <br><b>Michael Kilcoyne</b> <br>Horwich, Lancashire</p>",

There is no doubt the Labour government of 1997 was a severe shock to many members and indeed took some decisions even Mrs Thatcher would have shrunk from. But over the last four years they have changed, possibly because of the energies of Liz Davies and others. Mr Brown's Budget was a masterpiece even Denis Healey at the height of his powers would have been proud of. It gave a massive priority to children and their education and still took account of the needs of pensioners. What more could true socialists realistically ask for? Politics requires patience. Barry Martin Chadlington, Oxon barry@chadlington.fsnet.co.uk \u0095 I had difficulty recognising the 1999 Labour party conference from the image projected by Liz Davies. Certainly, and not before time, inexperienced delegates were afforded whatever help they needed in getting their points across in a succinct and lucid way. Getting up be fore the nation's media in a crowded hall is not easy. And from my soundings, as a constituency delegate, first-time speakers appreciated the support they were given. I spoke in the Northern Ireland debate. No one told me what to say or how to say it. How could they? Once a delegate gets to the rostrum, the floor is his or hers. And short of publicly slandering the chair, it's difficult to shut them up within their allotted time. My recollection of comrades Davies, Willsman and Seddon was of three kids sulking around the nursery refusing to play with the other children because they didn't like the game. The game is called government and the great majority of us in the Labour party like it. Cllr Nick Nolan Leader, Coventry council nick.nolan@coventry.gov.uk \u0095 It is tiresome for NEC members to be lectured for failing to be sufficiently critical of the government. One compelling reason for a degree of inhibition about debating issues was the reluctance of many members to have their comments and questions leaked to the press and provide material on which to base allegations of damaging splits. Grassroots alliance members were frequently reminded that their propensity to provide colourful accounts of NEC meetings were in this sense counterproductive. Cllr Jeremy Beecham Leader, Labour group, Local Government Association \u0095 Perhaps Liz Davies now understands how many of us felt when the party we loved was taken over by the Militants and Bennites in the 70s and 80s. We stayed, we won, we were elected. Michael Kilcoyne Horwich, Lancashire",

Now it is responsible for a quarter of the deaths in the UK. More than 150,000 people die of it every year. The alarming increase in the death rates has caused many people to point the finger of accusation at the changing environment, fearing that pollution, our diet or nuclear power must be to blame. </p> <p>But most common cancers that are identified today have other origins, according to Anthony Swerdlow, of the Institute of Cancer Research, and colleagues.

      "bodyText": "The sexual revolution of the 1960s, together with less cautious behaviour during the two world wars when death appeared ever imminent, are behind the rise in cervical cancer, just as smoking has caused the lung cancer epidemic, according to research chronicling the last century of the disease. In Victorian times, relatively few people died of cancer. Now it is responsible for a quarter of the deaths in the UK. More than 150,000 people die of it every year. The alarming increase in the death rates has caused many people to point the finger of accusation at the changing environment, fearing that pollution, our diet or nuclear power must be to blame. But most common cancers that are identified today have other origins, according to Anthony Swerdlow, of the Institute of Cancer Research, and colleagues. One is our increasing lifespan - in past centuries, infectious diseases carried people off long before they were likely to develop cancers. Lifestyle has played a big part in the increase of some cancers, most notably lung cancer. Professor Swerdlow and colleagues, who yesterday launched their research in book form (Oxford University Press), published data correlating the enormous rise in smoking from the 19th century with the rise and now fall in the epidemic as a result. Cervical cancer is now thought to be caused by a sexual infection. Higher cancer rates followed both world wars and also the arrival of the contraceptive pill in the 1960s which launched new sexual freedom. There has now been a sharp downturn in cervical cancer and gonorrhoea which are thought to be connected to barrier contraception and reduced promiscuity once people became aware of the risk of HIV/Aids. Cheap package holidays which began in the 1950s and the quest for a deep tan have been a direct cause of increased cases of malignant melanoma, or skin cancer, the research shows. However, the data do not support any link between either mobile phone use and brain cancer or electricity and childhood leukaemia, says Prof Swerdlow. There is as yet no explanation for breast cancer, which increased apparently inexorably for 100 years until the 1980s. Since then, however, screening, better diagnosis and powerful treatments have brought the death rates steeply down. Prof Swerdlow says that the book gives cause for optimism. \"We examined the trends in cancer in this country over a long period and the factors that may have caused them.

It's effective if a bit overrated, but there's no denying a stupendous performance by Jamie Bell, just 15. To be this good as a novice actor would be impressive; to be this good as a dancer too seems miraculous. And it's the dancing scenes - especially one in the tight, claustrophobic brick surrounds that recalls East is East's exuberance - that stay with you, and more than cancel out some of the more sentimental views of northern life, as well as the uncertain plotting. It's set in Durham, 1984, a virtual war zone in the midst of the bitter miners' strike, and uses dance as an expression of frustration, something to lose yourself in, to hit back at the ugliness, strife and claustrophobia surrounding a young life. Bell makes it more than just The Full Monty with pli\u00e9s. </p> <p><strong>Hollow Man</strong><br> Retail and DVD rental Columbia Cert 18<br></p> <p>Kevin Bacon discovers the secret of invisibility and, like any self-respecting mad film scientist, gets a God complex, with a wide streak of devil to go with it. From a promising start, Paul Verhoeven's film winds up with a pretty routine Old Dark House/ Alien plot: it's mad, bad Kev vs the world. But, plot be damned, the point of Hollow Man is its effects, and they are a spectacular entr\u00e9e into the world of blood, bones and tissue. Bacon goes through elaborate stages of visibility which work as a fantastic anatomy lesson as well as showing invisibility underwater or in the rain. You can't help feeling body-meister David Cronenberg would have found better uses for all this technology, but where Verhoeven's superior predecessor, Starship Troopers, had no DVD extras at all, this uses the medium properly, explaining its conception in great detail and showing the frenetic Dutchman at work, acting out each part with abandon. As Bacon says: \"I have to play a mad scientist, so it's good to have one around.\" </p> <p><strong>Ring</strong><br> Rental, retail (\u00a315.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99) Tartan Cert 15 <br></p> <p>Japanese horror has had a boom year with Audition and this first film from the Ring trilogy; both this and Ring 2, the sequel, had a recent cinematic release. It's like The Blair Witch Project - thematically but not stylistically - fused with Cronenberg's Videodrome. Its scariest moments top both, but it uses subtle suggestion more than shock effects for the most part, putting flesh on the bones of a silly story about a cursed video which is followed by a phone call giving the viewer one week to live. The combination of old folk tales and new technology provides a lot of its distinctive feel. It certainly leaves you wanting to see Ring 2, shown as part two of a double bill in the east, where it was a smash-hit. If you find yourself in the horror section, you'd do far better with this than the crass, depressing Scary Movie. </p> <p><strong>The Little Vampire</strong><br> Retail (\u00a314.99) and DVD (\u00a315.99) Icon Cert U<br> </p> <p>At the age of 10, Jonathan Lipnicki seems to have a monopoly on good kid comedy roles. He was brother to a mouse in Stuart Little and here, showing the same winning combination of puzzlement and determination, he is a kid obsessed by vampires in another enjoyable, cheerful comedy ideal for multi-generational viewing. For kids, there's a strong identification figure in a bullied child letting his imagination run wild in Scotland, where his parents are working. For oldies, there's a lovely running joke about a herd of vampire cows, Jim Carter as a vampire slayer who is more roughie than Buffy, and Richard E Grant who always has looked vampiric, wrapping his perfect elocution round lines like \"We need darkness, dampness and decay\" (\"and the finest wines available to humanity,\" you half-expect him to add since this is a medieval close relative of Withnail). The Little Vampire throws in a few film references without nudging you in the ribs too much and this is jolly stuff by Uli Edel, once the grim realist director of Christiane F and Last Exit to Brooklyn.</p>",

Love, St Paul.\" If he had seen this film, he might have re-phrased it: Stop enjoying yourselves, Bela Tarr's about the place. Such is the severity, the terrible gloom and the uncompromising focus on an eternity of despair - leavened with dyspeptic moments of comedy - with which this remarkable Hungarian director is ready to assail us. </p> <p>Damnation, made in 1988, is only the first of Tarr's films to gain UK distribution: a black-and-white document of political and existential pessimism. Set in the late Soviet era of filth, disillusion and industrial decay, the movie takes place in continuous, driving rain: rain that gets everywhere, rain that adds a millimetre or two of mucky slop to the floor of bars and cafes, rain that we see in the process of staining and eroding the ubiquitous concrete. It is a rain in which there will be no singin'.</p> <p>Tarr's first shot is of a cable-car arrangement of great industrial-sized buckets being carried joylessly along the lowering central European skyline. They contain coal perhaps, or sludge, or waste matter, probably without the safety treatment that would prevent its eventual disposal from despoiling the already extensively ravaged environment or seeding the population with a million different cancers. Or perhaps, in the manner of Mike Hodges' Get Carter, one contains a dead body to be dumped some way far off.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, Tarr's camera stays on it for a long time, the first of many lugubrious takes that facilitate the unending sense of an inexorable fate grinding onwards. We pull back to see Karrer (Miklos B Szekely), a man who spends a lot of time brooding and watching those cable-cars - whose jaundiced figure, bowed with anxiety and weariness, we are to see trudging about like a lost soul in hell.</p> <p>Karrer is actually the locus of what in any other movie would be a racy and engaging plot. He is hopelessly in love with a nightclub singer; he is threatened by her husband and hangs about outside her abysmal apartment building, begging for admittance, and is at one stage successful. Furthermore, he is privy to a reasonably lucrative smuggling scam - a parcel which must be delivered and returned - which he senses could get the husband out of the way. But any conceivable drama or furtive eroticism latent in all this is entirely passed over in favour of a dark and general assessment of the futility of it all. It is as if Tarr has disengaged from these preposterous local activities and stepped back to inspect the bigger picture.</p> <p>And what a picture it is. Immobile faces, crumbling slag heaps, desperately sad knees-ups in the local bar - somehow more desperately sad when the music is frenziedly upbeat: an earnest rock number or a jigging, jerking waltz. The black-and-white photography transforms banal reality into painterly beauty and endows the ugly, lined faces with an unearthly glow, as if they have become phosphorescent with decay and defeat.</p> <p>It is a grim panorama which Tarr differentiates, moreover, with cruces of spiritual disintegration. Karrer confesses that nothing scares him more than children with their bright eyes and cute little faces, because they swindle mankind into going on with this charade and condemn us all to an eternity of horror. Further, he confesses that he drove his late wife to suicide by telling her that he never loved her, out of a pure Beckettian sense of wanting to know \"if it made sense to speak at all\". These moments are counterpointed by bizarre flourishes of comedy: Karrer turns on a dog that has been tormenting him and gets down on his hands and knees and growls until it goes away.</p> <p>So who needs it? Do we not, as John Osborne said in another context, get enough of this at home? I can only say that miserabilist though its theology might be, there is a weird and mesmeric quality in Damnation. It induces a floating trance-like sensation like something to be found in Tarkovsky. This is not a film that will have you whistling a happy tune on your way out of the theatre. In fact, a responsible manager will demand your tie and bootlaces on the way in. But it is arresting cinema.</p>",
