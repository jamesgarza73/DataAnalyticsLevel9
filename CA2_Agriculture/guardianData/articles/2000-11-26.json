Why Rio Ferdinand? Why \u00a318m? Why now, when the future of the transfer system is in doubt? And what's wrong with signing cut-price foreigners like everybody else does, including Harry Redknapp, who is already looking at a couple of players around the \u00a32m mark. </p> <p>As a bold stroke, an indication to the fans of the extent of your ambition, few things beat breaking the transfer record for an English player. Just ask Newcastle supporters how they felt in 1996. The Alan Shearer deal remains just about the only time Newcastle put one over Manchester United when it mattered. Yet even so, Shearer was acknowledged as the best striker in the country at the time, an England regular fresh from a successful Euro 96. </p> <p>The most expensive players are almost always strikers, or at least forwards. Kevin Keegan would never have splashed \u00a315m on a defender, even had he known what one looked like. And Shearer was a Geordie, returning to his roots. Whether Newcastle saw good value for their \u00a315m is a moot point, as it often is when players move for such astronomical sums, but at least you could see why they did it. </p> <p>The deal made sense from all parties' points of view, even including Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand and Darren Huckerby, whose departures from St James' Park between 1995 and 1997 put over \u00a313m in the kitty. </p> <p>The same cannot be said of the deal Leeds have just completed. Rio Ferdinand is a splendid player with a lot of potential, but not even his best friends, who appear to include Franco Baresi, would describe him as the best defender in the world. </p> <p>Yet Leeds have just made him the most expensive. It was tempting to wonder what Real Madrid made of it all on Wednesday at Elland Road. No strangers to breaking transfer records or paying out eye-watering wages, the Spanish giants' defence is full of world class defenders - Roberto Carlos, Ivan Campos, Fernando Hierro, Michel Salgado and the enviably accomplished Ivan Helguera - who suddenly look like bargains. Ferdinand is not in that league at the moment, and there is room for debate, shall we say, about whether he ever will be. </p> <p>Helguera, moreover, is understood to be available and has been linked with a move to England. At 25, he is already the player Leeds hope Ferdinand will turn into. Strong, assertive, fabulous on the ball, and with a Champions League winner's medal already in his collection. Leeds would not have had to break the transfer record to sign a player like that, although they would have had to revise their wage structure. </p> <p>Ferdinand's estimated \u00a330,000 a week will not be out of line with other Elland Road earners, and is in fact only \u00a310,000 a week more than he was picking up at West Ham. (Apologies for the ludicrousness of that last sentence, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain even a pretence of normality when discussing footballers' wages.) You can see the logic, though it seems a peculiar sort of parsimony when you are throwing \u00a318m around for a 22-year-old. </p> <p>Credit where it is due, however. Leeds have not only shown the colour of their money, they have done two things which English clubs are criticised for not doing. In the first place they have bought an Englishman, actually paying over the odds instead of seeking to bring in a more reasonably priced mercenary from abroad. And they have also splashed out on a young player, someone with the best years of his career still ahead of him, instead of going for the safety-first option of a proven performer with only a couple of seasons left at the highest level. </p> <p>In the brave new Yorkshire world of spendthriftery, Leeds paying Ferdinand \u00a330,000 a week is more sensible than Middlesbrough handing Alen Boksic \u00a363,000. </p> <p>This is not anti-foreign prejudice, or even bias against Middlesbrough. The fact of the matter is that Leeds can afford to spend \u00a318m on a player because they are in the Champions League, and want to still be in the Champions League next season. Middlesbrough are closer to the Nationwide League than the Champions League, and though a charitable view of Robson's signing policy might be that you have to spend big to catch the big spenders, the Teesside experience suggests this is not a path many other small but ambitious clubs will follow. </p> <p>The difference between the two positions represents a real dilemma for Premiership clubs. The Champions League is incredibly divisive. If you are in it, you receive all the financial incentives necessary to practically double your playing strength, either by increasing the size of your squad or splashing out on players. Make a decent fist of the first group stage and you also get at least a dozen high-intensity games against the best sides in Europe. </p> <p>When you have gone toe to toe with Barcelona or AC Milan you may be tired, but that Saturday trip to Highfield Road is never going to be as daunting again. If you are outside the echelon, on the other hand, it is impossible to compete for leading players, and you have a choice between buying what is left in a desperate bid to crash the party (Liverpool, Chelsea, Middlesbrough) or keeping your head down and accepting a reduced station (too many to mention). From time to time you will also lose your best players to clubs with more ambition, ie those in the Champions League. You will receive compensation, but not be able to spend it on players of similar quality, and soon your supporters will be accusing you of lacking ambition. </p> <p>West Ham are going through this now, though they will probably cope more cheerfully than Spurs, who will have even more angst to come when Sol Campbell jumps ship to a Champions League club. You can't blame players for wanting to perform at the highest level, and neither can clubs be expected to do anything other than seek to maintain their Champions League status. </p> <p>The one, hollow, consolation for small clubs is that though Rio Ferdinand could not have become the world's most expensive defender without Ridsdale's ambition or O'Leary's skill, he could not have done it either without Southampton and Bradford. </p> <p>Those two clubs between them were responsible for taking four points off Liverpool in the final games of last season, letting Leeds slip into the Champions League practically by default.

      "body": "<p><strong> Chairman Dot denies all</strong> </p> <p>Smooth words from gossip-loving Leeds chairman Peter 'Dot Cotton' Ridsdale last week. After denying responsibility for spreading rumours designed to prise Rio Ferdinand from West Ham, Ridsdale - according to Sunderland boss Peter Reid - then tried the same trick with Kevin Phillips. 'How do I feel about these Phillips rumours?' Reid told hacks. 'I'm delighted. It's great. Just ask Peter Ridsdale about Phillips. There is an unwritten rule that you don't talk about another club's players in public, but Ridsdale prefers to do it differently. I'm sick and tired of it.' </p> <p>Reid's in good company - in August, Harry Redknapp said he was 'pissed off' with Ridsdale's public wooing of Ferdinand, which ultimately resulted in last week's \u00a318m deal. Ridsdale, though, says he was clean then - he denies unsettling Ferdinand over a five-month period - and, in an entertainingly put statement last week says he's clean now. 'I spoke to Peter Reid a week last Friday and told him we had no interest in Kevin Phillips. I will not allow him to blame me for the constant rumours in football that Phillips is unhappy at Sunderland and is desperate to leave.' According to reports, Ridders has now turned his attention to Inter's Robbie Keane, Atletico Madrid's Juninho and Feyenoord midfielder Brett Emerton - all of whom, we hear, are unhappy, desperate to leave, and would be happier with a Yorkshire-based club. </p> <p><strong> Fergie 'Pugwash' shocker</strong> </p> <p>Did Alex Ferguson learn his motivational tactics from Captain Pugwash? On Manchester United's coma-inducing new Christmas video Beyond the Promised Land , there's some strange footage of a United players' quiz night. Despite allegations of question-rigging from Roy Keane, the management team of Fergie, Steve McLaren and various coaches romps home. First, the over-competitive gaffer knows that tanks run on caterpillar tracks and that Gershwin wrote Rhapsody in Blue (Teddy Sheringham opts for Schubert). Then comes the clincher: 'Which sailor was captain of a ship called the Black Pig?' 'Captain Pugwash!' shouts Ferguson, who then bangs the table in triumph at winning the quiz. Hence - presumably - his refusal to censor David Beckham for wearing bandanas - and for spending \u00a310m on Barnabas lookalike Jaap Stam - it's all just Pugwash chic.</p> <p><em> Manchester United Beyond the Promised Land - almost certainly the worst football video ever made - now available from Icon, \u00a315.99 </em></p> <p><strong>'Bizarre' referee starts riots</strong> </p> <p>Officials in Malawi took a referee to hospital for blood and alcohol tests after a controversial Super League match in which he awarded both teams two penalties and then attacked a photographer. Referee Dinner Nathaya, who serves on the Fifa panel, was found to be sober despite allegations from both Telecom Wanderers and Silver Strikers, who described his performance as 'bizarre'. The fourth penalty decision prompted rioting in the stands - at one point the game was halted for 20 minutes while police fired tear gas - but once the game resumed, Nathaya's erratic behaviour increased. 'Officiating in this country has left a lot to be desired in the past but honestly I have never seen anything as bad as this,' said Super League chairman Hastings Kapenuka. Players watched as Kapenuka drove the referee away for tests. 'He's a crazy man.' </p> <p><strong>Caring wife of the week</strong> </p> <p> 'Yeah, he's got that obsessive compulsive thing where everything has to match. He's got it, like, ridiculously.' </p> <p>- Victoria Beckham, reacting to her husband's illness, revealed by last Sunday's tabloids. </p> <p><strong>Tales from the Tabs</strong> </p> <p><strong> CHELSEA LAND DAVIDS</strong> </p> <p>Claudio Ranieri's move for Edgar Davids could go through this week after Ken Bates approved a massive \u00a320m package for Juve's Dutch midfielder. Arsenal had been favourites to land the Euro 2000 star, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger won't spend big before Christmas. </p> <p><strong> FIND ME A STRIKER</strong> </p> <p>Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis has told manager John Gregory: 'Find me a new striker to buy - and be quick about it.' Ellis is ready to splash \u00a310m on Celta Vigo's Benni McCarthy, but wants a deal quickly. 'John has a list of 13 targets - we need to bid now.' </p> <p><strong> And the rest... </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Coventry keeper Magnus Hedman has denied discussing a \u00a36m switch to <strong> Arsenal - </strong> Ars\u00e9ne Wenger has targeted Francesco Toldo instead, but won't match Fiorentina's \u00a320m asking price.

      "bodyText": "Chairman Dot denies all Smooth words from gossip-loving Leeds chairman Peter 'Dot Cotton' Ridsdale last week. After denying responsibility for spreading rumours designed to prise Rio Ferdinand from West Ham, Ridsdale - according to Sunderland boss Peter Reid - then tried the same trick with Kevin Phillips. 'How do I feel about these Phillips rumours?' Reid told hacks. 'I'm delighted. It's great. Just ask Peter Ridsdale about Phillips. There is an unwritten rule that you don't talk about another club's players in public, but Ridsdale prefers to do it differently. I'm sick and tired of it.' Reid's in good company - in August, Harry Redknapp said he was 'pissed off' with Ridsdale's public wooing of Ferdinand, which ultimately resulted in last week's \u00a318m deal. Ridsdale, though, says he was clean then - he denies unsettling Ferdinand over a five-month period - and, in an entertainingly put statement last week says he's clean now. 'I spoke to Peter Reid a week last Friday and told him we had no interest in Kevin Phillips. I will not allow him to blame me for the constant rumours in football that Phillips is unhappy at Sunderland and is desperate to leave.' According to reports, Ridders has now turned his attention to Inter's Robbie Keane, Atletico Madrid's Juninho and Feyenoord midfielder Brett Emerton - all of whom, we hear, are unhappy, desperate to leave, and would be happier with a Yorkshire-based club. Fergie 'Pugwash' shocker Did Alex Ferguson learn his motivational tactics from Captain Pugwash? On Manchester United's coma-inducing new Christmas video Beyond the Promised Land , there's some strange footage of a United players' quiz night. Despite allegations of question-rigging from Roy Keane, the management team of Fergie, Steve McLaren and various coaches romps home. First, the over-competitive gaffer knows that tanks run on caterpillar tracks and that Gershwin wrote Rhapsody in Blue (Teddy Sheringham opts for Schubert). Then comes the clincher: 'Which sailor was captain of a ship called the Black Pig?' 'Captain Pugwash!' shouts Ferguson, who then bangs the table in triumph at winning the quiz. Hence - presumably - his refusal to censor David Beckham for wearing bandanas - and for spending \u00a310m on Barnabas lookalike Jaap Stam - it's all just Pugwash chic. Manchester United Beyond the Promised Land - almost certainly the worst football video ever made - now available from Icon, \u00a315.99 'Bizarre' referee starts riots Officials in Malawi took a referee to hospital for blood and alcohol tests after a controversial Super League match in which he awarded both teams two penalties and then attacked a photographer. Referee Dinner Nathaya, who serves on the Fifa panel, was found to be sober despite allegations from both Telecom Wanderers and Silver Strikers, who described his performance as 'bizarre'. The fourth penalty decision prompted rioting in the stands - at one point the game was halted for 20 minutes while police fired tear gas - but once the game resumed, Nathaya's erratic behaviour increased. 'Officiating in this country has left a lot to be desired in the past but honestly I have never seen anything as bad as this,' said Super League chairman Hastings Kapenuka. Players watched as Kapenuka drove the referee away for tests. 'He's a crazy man.' Caring wife of the week 'Yeah, he's got that obsessive compulsive thing where everything has to match. He's got it, like, ridiculously.' - Victoria Beckham, reacting to her husband's illness, revealed by last Sunday's tabloids. Tales from the Tabs CHELSEA LAND DAVIDS Claudio Ranieri's move for Edgar Davids could go through this week after Ken Bates approved a massive \u00a320m package for Juve's Dutch midfielder. Arsenal had been favourites to land the Euro 2000 star, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger won't spend big before Christmas. FIND ME A STRIKER Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis has told manager John Gregory: 'Find me a new striker to buy - and be quick about it.' Ellis is ready to splash \u00a310m on Celta Vigo's Benni McCarthy, but wants a deal quickly. 'John has a list of 13 targets - we need to bid now.' And the rest... \u0095 Coventry keeper Magnus Hedman has denied discussing a \u00a36m switch to Arsenal - Ars\u00e9ne Wenger has targeted Francesco Toldo instead, but won't match Fiorentina's \u00a320m asking price.

'Fulham show us what the game is all about.' </p> <p>Fulham's clinical demolition job was in sharp contrast to the performance of third-placed Bolton, who wasted numerous scoring opportunities at Sheffield United, and paid for it with the 81st- minute Lee Sandford goal which gave United a 1-0 win. </p> <p>But taking chances is clearly no problem at the moment with West Bromwich Albion, thanks to Lee Hughes. He scored his second hat-trick in a week to take his total for the season to 14, give his team a 3-1 win over Preston and lift them to fourth in the table - not a bad way to celebrate the birth of his baby daughter. West Brom's manager, Gary Megson, said: 'Lee deserves all his success because he is working his socks off. His previous hat-trick (against Gillingham) came from shots inside the box. This time, they were all long-range efforts.' </p> <p>Perhaps the pick of the bunch was his third, when he charged past two Preston defenders and looped a perfect shot over their keeper, David Lucas. Preston's efforts to get back into the game, after Iain Anderson had reduced the arrears, were not helped when they had Michael Appleton sent off half an hour from the end for a second bookable offence.</p> <p>The biggest surprise was Blackburn's 2-1 home defeat by Gillingham, their first in nine matches. What made it particularly hard for Graeme Souness and his troops to take was that Mark Hughes had put them in the driving seat after just 12 minutes and the goal which sunk them was an own goal by Blackburn's defender John Curtis. On top of this, Blackburn's David Dunn was shown the red card, as was Gillingham's Paul Shaw. </p> <p>'Put it down as a bad day at the office,' Souness said. 'We have too many players who took their eye off the ball. Just when you think it is going along lovely something like this happens, but that's what you can expect in football, and it's how you deal with it that really matters.' </p> <p>On the premise that football management can damage your health, Souness has a good reason for not getting uptight about setbacks. Five weeks ago, he had another heart operation - in Ohio - and he said: 'When I had a triple bypass eight years ago, it later came out that one of the arteries was still blocked. </p> <p>'I hadn't felt too good during my time over in Portugal and this was an opportunity to get it sorted out. The doctors over in America have put what they call scaffolding in and hopefully that will do the trick, I feel better already.' </p> <p>If Wimbledon's John Hartson is disappointed at having lost another chance to move on to a bigger stage - at Charlton - he certainly isn't showing it. </p> <p>He scored the first goal in Wimbledon's 2-1 win against Norwich, which took him into double figures for the season, and Wimbledon's manager, Terry Burton, said: 'It was an excellent goal. It just shows how good he can be when he gets the ball in and around the box - in fact, I don't think there is a better finisher in this division.' </p> <p>In addition to that man Hughes, another striker who might have something to say about this is Wolves's George Ndah, whose comeback following more than 12 months out through injury yielded his second goal in as many matches at QPR. </p> <p>The latter twice came from behind to get a 2-2 draw, courtesy of two goals (one a penalty) by Gavin Peacock. </p> <p>But the best scoring achievement could be found in the Third Division, where Scunthorpe's Guy Ipoua, who scored a hat-trick last week, got four of the goals in their 6-0 win against Mansfield.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Fulham are leading the Nationwide League's charge on the Worthington Cup, but influential midfielder Lee Clark is uncompromising in his assessment of how important the competition is to the First Division leaders. </p> <p>With seven of the last 16 coming from outside the Premiership - six from the First Division - the scent of a major final will grow stronger for those who prevail in this week's fourth round. But, with his side about to face struggling Derby County, Clark's focus remains fixed on the league. </p> <p>'Promotion is what this season is all about,' he said. 'Give everyone at Fulham the choice between three points at Preston next weekend or making progress against Derby and we'll take the three points. </p> <p>'Nevertheless, we also know that the Worthington Cup means a direct route into Europe for the winners. That's a great incentive.' </p> <p>If all the above sounds like stock diplomacy from a disciplined, focused professional, it's perhaps understandable. Clark has sailed close to controversy in the past and while he has the air of a young, carefree player, it's a good mask. </p> <p>At 28 he finds himself locked once again into a promotion campaign, having helped Newcastle reach the fledgling Premiership in 1993 and prompted and probed in Sunderland's midfield as they won the league by a record margin in 1999. On the day he left Newcastle for Wearside in 1997 he was named in an England squad by Glenn Hoddle. He is a player of genuine class and Premiership quality yet here he is again, scrapping to join the elite. </p> <p>His last move two summers ago was coloured with controversy. Having enjoyed the celebrations following Sunderland's promotion he found himself in the middle of a furore after the revelation that he had joined Newcastle-supporting pals at the FA Cup final against Manchester United ... wearing a T-shirt mocking the Wearside fans he then played for: 'Sad Mackem Bastards' screamed the logo and Clark, a lifelong Gallowgate fan, had to go. </p> <p>His account of that departure from the North-East is compellingly honest. 'The T-shirt incident is a massive regret in my career,' he says. 'But although we'd won promotion, I had already told Peter Reid, the manager, that I was thinking of moving. In hindsight, joining Sunderland was a mistake. </p> <p>'A mistake because of my background. Everyone knows I'm Newcastle through and through. When I left Newcastle, the prospect of staying in the North-East, close to my family, was the big pull in going to Sunderland. But when we won promotion it dawned on me what that really meant. I would have to go to Newcastle the following season as a Sunderland player. </p> <p>'I couldn't do that. Not to go there and give 100 per cent for Sunderland against the club I love and played for. And if I couldn't do that I'd have been cheating on Peter Reid, his assistant Bobby Saxton, the fans and all my team-mates. It was best that I went and Peter Reid knew how I felt before what happened at Wembley.' </p> <p>If that sounds 'unprofessional' Clark is unfazed and brutally frank. 'I'm just being honest. It's how I feel. It won't be a problem if Fulham are lucky enough to win promotion. It's not a problem at all in my going to Newcastle as a Fulham player and giving everything - that would be a very different situation.To understand you have to know the feeling in the North-East between the two clubs.' </p> <p>Clark tempers this confession by accentuating the upside of his two years on Wearside. He was accepted by the fans: 'They knew where my heart lay but were happy so long as I did the business for Sunderland on the pitch. And they knew I did that - always. </p> <p>'We got to the play-off final in my first year and won the title in the second. It was the right manager - Peter was great for me - the right people but ultimately the wrong move.' </p> <p>Although there were other options, almost certainly including Premiership clubs, Clark went to Fulham to be reunited with Paul Bracewell, his old team-mate at Newcastle. </p> <p>'This club felt right for me,' he says. '\"Brace\" had been my team-mate at Newcastle and then my assistant manager at Sunderland and he's been a big influence on my career. The club had big ambitions and I wanted to be part of that.' </p> <p>When Bracewell was sacked last season it left Clark a little bewildered in the big city at a club now stripped of the North-East influence that had formed part of the attraction when he joined. </p> <p>'It hit me quite hard,' he admits. 'He [Bracewell] was certainly a major influence in my coming here. But he was adamant that I should stick around with Fulham.' </p> <p>And stick he did, finding a the new manager with even better international midfield credentials than Bracewell - Jean Tigana. So far, the move has been wonderful for Tigana, Fulham and also Clark. </p> <p>A blip following an unbeaten start to the campaign followed defeat in October at home to Preston but that is now forgotten. Fulham went into the weekend five points clear and the talk is often not if Fulham go up - but when. </p> <p>Clark, a veteran of those successful Tyne-Wear campaigns in the Nineties, is perfectly placed to assess their chances and their capability. 'I'd say right away that we're not taking anything for granted. I know only too well that it can go wrong if you take your eyes off the target. </p> <p>'It's getting harder all the time to get out of this division. But we are well-placed and there are plenty of players here at Fulham, not only me, who have played Premiership football and want to get back there.' </p> <p>If Fulham make the top flight for the first time since the Sixties, what will Clark's advice to his colleagues be, especially those without Premiership experience? His answer is swift and characteristically frank: 'Keep the ball for as long as possible, as long as you can,' he says. </p> <p>'Because once the opposition have got it, they'll give it to strikers who are world class and will punish you. One chance and it's in the back of your net.' </p> <p>Last weekend, as he was scoring and helping Fulham to a convincing win against Portsmouth, his old clubs were meeting on Tyneside, where Sunderland won 2-1 before more than 52,000 fans. </p> <p>'I was so pleased to beat Pompey and then I was instantly gutted when I heard the derby score,' Clark admitted. But now he has the prospect - without counting chickens - of facing both clubs if Fulham go up. </p> <p>'If we do, I'd love to go back to St James' because I haven't played there since I left. As for the Stadium of Light...' he smiles awkwardly to himself... 'that will be a bit hot, won't it?'</p>",

But when we won promotion it dawned on me what that really meant. I would have to go to Newcastle the following season as a Sunderland player. 'I couldn't do that. Not to go there and give 100 per cent for Sunderland against the club I love and played for. And if I couldn't do that I'd have been cheating on Peter Reid, his assistant Bobby Saxton, the fans and all my team-mates. It was best that I went and Peter Reid knew how I felt before what happened at Wembley.' If that sounds 'unprofessional' Clark is unfazed and brutally frank. 'I'm just being honest. It's how I feel. It won't be a problem if Fulham are lucky enough to win promotion. It's not a problem at all in my going to Newcastle as a Fulham player and giving everything - that would be a very different situation.To understand you have to know the feeling in the North-East between the two clubs.' Clark tempers this confession by accentuating the upside of his two years on Wearside. He was accepted by the fans: 'They knew where my heart lay but were happy so long as I did the business for Sunderland on the pitch. And they knew I did that - always. 'We got to the play-off final in my first year and won the title in the second. It was the right manager - Peter was great for me - the right people but ultimately the wrong move.' Although there were other options, almost certainly including Premiership clubs, Clark went to Fulham to be reunited with Paul Bracewell, his old team-mate at Newcastle. 'This club felt right for me,' he says. '\"Brace\" had been my team-mate at Newcastle and then my assistant manager at Sunderland and he's been a big influence on my career. The club had big ambitions and I wanted to be part of that.' When Bracewell was sacked last season it left Clark a little bewildered in the big city at a club now stripped of the North-East influence that had formed part of the attraction when he joined. 'It hit me quite hard,' he admits. 'He [Bracewell] was certainly a major influence in my coming here. But he was adamant that I should stick around with Fulham.' And stick he did, finding a the new manager with even better international midfield credentials than Bracewell - Jean Tigana. So far, the move has been wonderful for Tigana, Fulham and also Clark. A blip following an unbeaten start to the campaign followed defeat in October at home to Preston but that is now forgotten. Fulham went into the weekend five points clear and the talk is often not if Fulham go up - but when. Clark, a veteran of those successful Tyne-Wear campaigns in the Nineties, is perfectly placed to assess their chances and their capability. 'I'd say right away that we're not taking anything for granted. I know only too well that it can go wrong if you take your eyes off the target. 'It's getting harder all the time to get out of this division. But we are well-placed and there are plenty of players here at Fulham, not only me, who have played Premiership football and want to get back there.' If Fulham make the top flight for the first time since the Sixties, what will Clark's advice to his colleagues be, especially those without Premiership experience? His answer is swift and characteristically frank: 'Keep the ball for as long as possible, as long as you can,' he says. 'Because once the opposition have got it, they'll give it to strikers who are world class and will punish you. One chance and it's in the back of your net.' Last weekend, as he was scoring and helping Fulham to a convincing win against Portsmouth, his old clubs were meeting on Tyneside, where Sunderland won 2-1 before more than 52,000 fans. 'I was so pleased to beat Pompey and then I was instantly gutted when I heard the derby score,' Clark admitted. But now he has the prospect - without counting chickens - of facing both clubs if Fulham go up. 'If we do, I'd love to go back to St James' because I haven't played there since I left. As for the Stadium of Light...' he smiles awkwardly to himself... 'that will be a bit hot, won't it?'",

And who cares about the neutrals? </p> <p>Few full-on supporters worry about anything bar the result and at least the right team won, the goal from Alex Rae worthy of claiming any match. </p> <p>Charlton recorded only one shot on target so had only themselves to blame for a dismal end to their unbeaten home record and manager Alan Curbishley was man enough to admit it. </p> <p>Solid Sunderland had not won away before they beat their arch rivals Newcastle last week. They did the same thing last season, when their win on Tyneside sparked a 10-game unbeaten run. 'Maybe it's an omen,' wondered Sunderland manager Peter Reid. 'What I do know is that we deserved to win - and it's not often that you feel you will win as a manager.' </p> <p>Reid, like many others in attendance, got that feeling early on as Sunderland controlled the first half and were only denied a lead at the interval when a Kevin Kilbane shot was superbly saved by Dean Kiely. </p> <p>But it was an afternoon big on rain and small on thrills. These sides played out a 4-4 bonanza when they last met, in that epic 1998 First Division Play-Off Final, which Charlton won on penalties. But there was no sign of a repeat yesterday. </p> <p>Admittedly, there was an early storm of an intensity rarely recorded since Noah took to his ark, and the players only had sets of long studs to help them cope with the conditions. But Sunderland seemed to handle it well enough and they remained on top after the break as Rae twice threatened to break the deadlock before he cracked his superb 58th-minute goal. </p> <p>Don Hutchison played him through and Rae ran on unchallenged before firing into the roof of the net with a 25-yard shot so powerful that Kiely just managed to throw a glance sideways as the ball flashed past him. </p> <p>Few will have witnessed a more venomous left-foot shot, so it is a mystery why this was Rae's first goal of the season. </p> <p>Charlton responded by making a double substitution, throwing on strikers Martin Pringle and Kevin Lisbie to form a three-man attack. Their problem, however, was that they were not getting the ball to the potential goalscorers - not their lack of presence up front.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Never mind the quality or the entertainment, points win prizes and pay the bills. And who cares about the neutrals? Few full-on supporters worry about anything bar the result and at least the right team won, the goal from Alex Rae worthy of claiming any match. Charlton recorded only one shot on target so had only themselves to blame for a dismal end to their unbeaten home record and manager Alan Curbishley was man enough to admit it. Solid Sunderland had not won away before they beat their arch rivals Newcastle last week. They did the same thing last season, when their win on Tyneside sparked a 10-game unbeaten run. 'Maybe it's an omen,' wondered Sunderland manager Peter Reid. 'What I do know is that we deserved to win - and it's not often that you feel you will win as a manager.' Reid, like many others in attendance, got that feeling early on as Sunderland controlled the first half and were only denied a lead at the interval when a Kevin Kilbane shot was superbly saved by Dean Kiely. But it was an afternoon big on rain and small on thrills. These sides played out a 4-4 bonanza when they last met, in that epic 1998 First Division Play-Off Final, which Charlton won on penalties. But there was no sign of a repeat yesterday. Admittedly, there was an early storm of an intensity rarely recorded since Noah took to his ark, and the players only had sets of long studs to help them cope with the conditions. But Sunderland seemed to handle it well enough and they remained on top after the break as Rae twice threatened to break the deadlock before he cracked his superb 58th-minute goal. Don Hutchison played him through and Rae ran on unchallenged before firing into the roof of the net with a 25-yard shot so powerful that Kiely just managed to throw a glance sideways as the ball flashed past him. Few will have witnessed a more venomous left-foot shot, so it is a mystery why this was Rae's first goal of the season. Charlton responded by making a double substitution, throwing on strikers Martin Pringle and Kevin Lisbie to form a three-man attack. Their problem, however, was that they were not getting the ball to the potential goalscorers - not their lack of presence up front.",

      "body": "<p>They may not show much of it away, but home is where Tottenham's heart is. A hat-trick by Les Ferdinand, his first for the club, made it seven wins in eight unbeaten Premiership games here, scuppering a disappointing Leicester's hopes of moving up to second in the table. </p> <p>Ferdinand's treble, doubling his tally for the season, was the classic centre-forward's combination of right foot, header and left foot; this against a side who came into the game with the best defensive record in the top flight, having previously conceded only one goal away from home. Perhaps Les was a bit annoyed that cousin Rio was stealing all the headlines. </p> <p>The man Peter Taylor had once made captain for an England B international made it an unhappy return for the City manager, back at the club he graced as a player. Taylor also had to endure his centre-back Gerry Taggart being sent off. For the first time in his managerial career, Taylor said, he would be asking a referee, in this case the notorious Rob Harris, to look at the video and reconsider his decision. </p> <p>Sometimes you get the feeling that the most perverse of Spurs fans do not especially relish winning these days; it merely prolongs George Graham's tenure as manager. Yesterday, though, they caught a mood of recent optimism at the end of a good week for the club that saw Liverpool beaten, their right-back Stephen Carr sign a new contract and Sol Campbell return after two months out with a dislocated shoulder. 'It just needs Sol to sign a new contract now,' said Graham. </p> <p>Campbell will need to see this being more than a false dawn, however. Certainly Graham wasn't fooled. He recognises that Spurs' away form remains worrying, with Manchester United the next opponents, grinning when it was suggested that Old Trafford next Saturday was a good place to test out new-found resolution. </p> <p>Significantly, too, he still bracketed Spurs below the best despite the three points moving them up to seventh in the table, in responding to an observation that his uncharacteristic 3-5-2 looks to suit the players available: 'The top teams all play 4-4-2 but it seems to suit those in the next band.' </p> <p>Leicester are one such and, combined with their organisation and spirit, they have risen to heady heights. Little of it was in evidence in a tetchy encounter worsened by Mr Harris's limp control of the game. 'I didn't think there was a lot of common sense shown,' lamented Taylor. </p> <p>These two teams have combustible chemistry, stemming from their feisty Worthington Cup final of two seasons ago, and it began in the first minute with Stephen Clemence squaring up to Robbie Savage, main target of the home support's disdain for those Wembley events. Late on, Savage was withdrawn with a second yellow card a likely prospect. </p> <p>Tottenham always seemed more likely to emerge from the skirmishes with a goal, their midfield of the talented 20-year-old Ledley King, Tim Sherwood and Darren Anderton dominating a side content to absorb pressure. </p> <p>It was the enthusiasm of King that broke the deadlock, as he harassed Gary Rowett into a wayward backpass, intercepted by Ferdinand, who went on to turn inside Matt Elliott and drive home a right-footer from 18 yards. </p> <p>Within five minutes it was two. Simon Royce turned aside a header by Tim Sherwood but from the corner, only half-cleared; Sergei Rebrov drove in a low shot that was kicked off the line by Frank Sinclair only to Ferdinand, who headed home the rebound off a post. </p> <p>Leicester had to come out of their shell in the second half and should have reduced the deficit, Elliott driving a volley straight at Neil Sullivan and Taggart blasting over the rebound. Soon Taggart's frustration surfaced as he lunged at Carr and received a second yellow card, though Taylor insisted no contact was made. </p> <p>With Taggart went Leicester's hopes of salvaging something and it came as no surprise when Ferdinand added a third, tapping home left-footed after Royce had only parried Anderton's shot. Rowett hit the bar with a header late in the game, but it was a token gesture. Much more of this, from both sides, and they could soon swop positions near the top of the Premiership's second strata.</p>",

Yesterday, though, they caught a mood of recent optimism at the end of a good week for the club that saw Liverpool beaten, their right-back Stephen Carr sign a new contract and Sol Campbell return after two months out with a dislocated shoulder. 'It just needs Sol to sign a new contract now,' said Graham. Campbell will need to see this being more than a false dawn, however. Certainly Graham wasn't fooled. He recognises that Spurs' away form remains worrying, with Manchester United the next opponents, grinning when it was suggested that Old Trafford next Saturday was a good place to test out new-found resolution. Significantly, too, he still bracketed Spurs below the best despite the three points moving them up to seventh in the table, in responding to an observation that his uncharacteristic 3-5-2 looks to suit the players available: 'The top teams all play 4-4-2 but it seems to suit those in the next band.' Leicester are one such and, combined with their organisation and spirit, they have risen to heady heights. Little of it was in evidence in a tetchy encounter worsened by Mr Harris's limp control of the game. 'I didn't think there was a lot of common sense shown,' lamented Taylor. These two teams have combustible chemistry, stemming from their feisty Worthington Cup final of two seasons ago, and it began in the first minute with Stephen Clemence squaring up to Robbie Savage, main target of the home support's disdain for those Wembley events. Late on, Savage was withdrawn with a second yellow card a likely prospect. Tottenham always seemed more likely to emerge from the skirmishes with a goal, their midfield of the talented 20-year-old Ledley King, Tim Sherwood and Darren Anderton dominating a side content to absorb pressure. It was the enthusiasm of King that broke the deadlock, as he harassed Gary Rowett into a wayward backpass, intercepted by Ferdinand, who went on to turn inside Matt Elliott and drive home a right-footer from 18 yards. Within five minutes it was two. Simon Royce turned aside a header by Tim Sherwood but from the corner, only half-cleared; Sergei Rebrov drove in a low shot that was kicked off the line by Frank Sinclair only to Ferdinand, who headed home the rebound off a post. Leicester had to come out of their shell in the second half and should have reduced the deficit, Elliott driving a volley straight at Neil Sullivan and Taggart blasting over the rebound. Soon Taggart's frustration surfaced as he lunged at Carr and received a second yellow card, though Taylor insisted no contact was made. With Taggart went Leicester's hopes of salvaging something and it came as no surprise when Ferdinand added a third, tapping home left-footed after Royce had only parried Anderton's shot. Rowett hit the bar with a header late in the game, but it was a token gesture. Much more of this, from both sides, and they could soon swop positions near the top of the Premiership's second strata.",

It had seemed harmless enough, walking through the forest grounds of an ancient castle, taking in the view. Now, I could hear the screams from above and to the left and right of me. Suddenly I found my shoulders gripped by something hard and immovable. I shut my eyes and said my first Hail Mary in years. We started moving upwards, bare legs dangling in the wind. Within seconds I was being hurled around at acute angles at great speed and screaming my head off. </p> <p>Duelling Dragons is the first dual coaster in the world. Victims are strapped into one of two coasters - Fire Dragon or Ice Dragon - which then speed towards each other at 60mph averting impact at the last second. It's terrifying, eyes open or shut, and best tackled on an empty stomach and definitely no hangover. Those wanting to ride the dragons must travel to the Lost Continent, part of Universal's new Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida, which boasts Steven Spielberg as creative consultant. It sits next door to Universal Studios and City Walk, a 30-acre themed complex full of bars, clubs and restaurants. </p> <p>Temporary respite came in the form of The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride. Moving in sync with 3D images that brought our surroundings alive, I could have sworn it really was Spiderman that landed on the bonnet of our car as it whizzed past fireballs and through water down into a 400ft sensory drop to be caught by his web. It was brilliant: I went on twice and felt about 10 years old. </p> <p>However, there's nothing like another dose of terror to concentrate the mind. The Incredible Hulk Coaster gave me a great chance to practise all those yoga deep breathing exercises I first learnt in the Alps when I got stuck in a blinding snowstorm. The Hulk, as it's affectionately known, catapulted us up a 150ft tunnel with the same force as a US Air Force F-16 fighter attack jet, turning us upside down more than 110 feet above ground. It took us from zero to 40mph in two seconds. I wished I'd paid more attention to my war reporter colleagues when they talked about coping with fear. My companions headed for Doctor Doom's Fearfall, which fires you 200ft to the top of a steel tower only to plummet you to the ground again at great speed. I went to the souvenir shop. </p> <p>In between helping Spiderman save The Statue of Liberty from evil villains and visiting the moving, lifesize triceratops at Jurassic Park, my inner child was calling again, taking me on a gentle meander through Seuss Landing, which is based on The Cat in the Hat novels of Theodore Geisel. We wandered through a colourful world of bendy buildings and wiggly trees all deliberately constructed without any straight lines. It was full of children and none of them were crying.

      "bodyText": "It was when they asked me to remove my slingbacks that I knew I was in trouble. It had seemed harmless enough, walking through the forest grounds of an ancient castle, taking in the view. Now, I could hear the screams from above and to the left and right of me. Suddenly I found my shoulders gripped by something hard and immovable. I shut my eyes and said my first Hail Mary in years. We started moving upwards, bare legs dangling in the wind. Within seconds I was being hurled around at acute angles at great speed and screaming my head off. Duelling Dragons is the first dual coaster in the world. Victims are strapped into one of two coasters - Fire Dragon or Ice Dragon - which then speed towards each other at 60mph averting impact at the last second. It's terrifying, eyes open or shut, and best tackled on an empty stomach and definitely no hangover. Those wanting to ride the dragons must travel to the Lost Continent, part of Universal's new Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida, which boasts Steven Spielberg as creative consultant. It sits next door to Universal Studios and City Walk, a 30-acre themed complex full of bars, clubs and restaurants. Temporary respite came in the form of The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ride. Moving in sync with 3D images that brought our surroundings alive, I could have sworn it really was Spiderman that landed on the bonnet of our car as it whizzed past fireballs and through water down into a 400ft sensory drop to be caught by his web. It was brilliant: I went on twice and felt about 10 years old. However, there's nothing like another dose of terror to concentrate the mind. The Incredible Hulk Coaster gave me a great chance to practise all those yoga deep breathing exercises I first learnt in the Alps when I got stuck in a blinding snowstorm. The Hulk, as it's affectionately known, catapulted us up a 150ft tunnel with the same force as a US Air Force F-16 fighter attack jet, turning us upside down more than 110 feet above ground. It took us from zero to 40mph in two seconds. I wished I'd paid more attention to my war reporter colleagues when they talked about coping with fear. My companions headed for Doctor Doom's Fearfall, which fires you 200ft to the top of a steel tower only to plummet you to the ground again at great speed. I went to the souvenir shop. In between helping Spiderman save The Statue of Liberty from evil villains and visiting the moving, lifesize triceratops at Jurassic Park, my inner child was calling again, taking me on a gentle meander through Seuss Landing, which is based on The Cat in the Hat novels of Theodore Geisel. We wandered through a colourful world of bendy buildings and wiggly trees all deliberately constructed without any straight lines. It was full of children and none of them were crying. Fantastic. The next day we headed for Universal Studios and the Men in Black ride, which features Will Smith as Agent J and Rip Torn as Director Zed. Armed with laser guns and riding in hi-tech MIB cars through the mean streets of New York, only we could help save the world from aliens whose spaceship had just landed.

      "byline": "Anthony Browne",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> First, let me confess. I have a vested interest in Scandinavian skiing. I owe it my life. Without it, I would not have been born. </p> <p>Back in the days when everything was in black and white, my father decided to go on holiday to Norway to learn about skiing. He stayed longer than he had intended: he'd fallen in love with a local skiing champion, who eventually moved back to England with him, became his wife, and my mother. </p> <p>Now, with unprofessional bias, I have to go back to my pre-roots, and make the comparison: does skiiing in Scandinavia match the Alps? Sweden's top ski resort, \u00c5re (pronounced 'Orr-er') is making a concerted effort to siphon off a bigger slice of the Alpine trade, in particular British families. </p> <p>The difference is obvious before you even arrive: \u00c5re is not easy to get to. Slap bang in the middle of Sweden, nudging up towards the Arctic Circle, it takes two flights and then a hour-long bus-ride to get there from Britain. Unlike the high volume Alpine destinations, there are no regular charters flying in every hour. </p> <p>But the journey is part of the experience, flying over a hauntingly beautiful frozen landscape, with icing-sugar sprinkled forests pitted with lakes used as roads and criss-crossed by car tracks. </p> <p>Its very remoteness means there are remarkably few foreigners there. It is a Swedish resort which is, well, full of healthy, tall, slim, fair-haired, blue-eyed Swedes who have been skiing as long as they have been walking. So not only is it very pleasing on the eye, but it also adds to the embarrassment factor for the complete skiing novice. </p> <p>Compared with Alpine resorts - packed with French, Italians, Germans and Japanese - the volume of Swedes makes it easy for the English: as they often speak our language better than we do. </p> <p>The downside is that the slopes are littered with knee-high toddler skiers, dubbed by the Swedes 'helmet footlings', who regularly dive-bomb adults at the speed of sound. When the helmet footlings are not endangering public safety, they are disturbingly well-behaved. \u00c5re attracts family groups and has lots of simple blue runs - children-only slopes - and parent-friendly facilities such as cr\u00e8ches. </p> <p>There are obviously more fundamental differences between Alpine and Nordic skiing - such as the snow itself. In Scandinavia, you get snow because you are far north rather than just because you are at the top of a mountain. That means you don't have to ascend in a cable car to the snow: it is everywhere around you. You can ski right into the heart of the village, pretty much down to sea level. </p> <p>Being so far north means that if you go in the middle of the season you get very short skiing days of only five hours or so - but then very long ones by April. It can also make it very cold - minus 30C is common in January. The sunshine is thinner and there is less risk of sunburn or altitude sickness. </p> <p>Because \u00c5re is not in the middle of a major mountain range, it lacks the scenic grandeur and geological drama of the Alps or Rockies. It also means the runs are shorter. The maximum altitude is just over 1,000 metres, with the longest drop in a run 850m. </p> <p>The snow is easily as good as the Alps - with added bizarre features. On top of the mountain, there are huge accumulations of 'blomsn ' ('cauliflower snow'), whipped into strange shapes by the often ferocious and moist Atlantic winds. </p> <p>With the first lift built in 1910, \u00c5re is Sweden's oldest ski resort and also its biggest. Its five interlocked villages now attract 300,000 visitors a year to its 45 different lifts and 98 pistes. </p> <p>It is not a resort for the daredevil professional (there are a few black slopes, but - put it like this - even I managed to get down them without falling over). To make up for this, the latest fashion is the insane ski-cross. Basically, you attempt to ski down a toboggan run with jumps added. It's like doing the Cresta run on skis and is terrifying. They have nets at every bend which I successfully got caught up in regularly. </p> <p>\u00c5re is the most alpine resort in Sweden, full of cutesy chalets for rent and lots of funky, hopping bars for apr\u00e9s ski or 'after ski' as the Swedes intriguingly call it. This being Sweden, one difference is the price. I saw a man buy a bottle of Bacardi with a 1000 Kr (\u00a380) note and get only a few coins for change. </p> <p>But despite its alpine appearance, \u00c5re is very definitely not in the Alps. Here, you are a visitor to a winter wonderland where the entire landscape and culture are based on snow. People cross-country ski and skidoo just as a way of getting around. Everywhere there is dog-sledging, ice climbing and reindeer rides. You even get reindeer wandering around the pistes. You can visit T nnforsen, Sweden's largest waterfall, suspended in icy motion. </p> <p>You can even go to see the oldest snow-culture of all, that of the Sami, or the Lapps as you are not meant to call them. Around 2,500 families in Sweden still subsist on reindeer and you can visit some of them in their huts, made of skin and logs, at Njarka Sami camp. There the Sami will cook you flat bread in the log fires and force-feed you weird twig-like sweets with a citrus flavour. </p> <p>They will also explain their reindeer culture. It was news to me that all reindeer, like cattle, are domesticated. </p> <p>Reindeer are quite tiny, little bigger than a Great Dane dog, and have luxuriantly soft fur. The fat in their wide flat feet remains soft even in very cold weather, making it ideal for protecting the skin. Oh, and they taste pretty good. </p> <p>You can go on reindeer sledge rides, which help to keep Rudolph employed outside Christmas. Or, actually, Rudolpha: male reindeers lose their antlers over Christmas, so Rudolph - who is always depicted with sparkling horns - must be female. </p> <p>Or if you want a bit more excitement, and don't mind farts in your face all the time, you can go dog sledging. We introduced ourselves to a team of 12 Alaskan huskies - half pure husky and, judging by their behaviour, half poodle. </p> <p>After extended instruction, I managed to turn the wooden sledge over in about 30 seconds, tipping my partner Paula over into the snow and dragging me along behind, desperately clinging on so I didn't lose the dogs and sledge. The dogs were the only beings around that didn't speak English and didn't understand 'Stop!' </p> <p>You have little control over the dogs, other than shouting instructions or braking by stamping a metal plate into the snow, which you do almost continuously, since the dogs are all eager enthusiasm, yelping, straining and running without a care - whether you have fallen off or they have just run under a low branch. </p> <p>It's exhilarating and you get to see the hauntingly serene winter landscape that you could otherwise see only by skiing crosscountry - or by taking the James Bond version of the dog sledge, the 85hp skidoo. We went on a 30 kilometre 'skidoo safari', at speeds of up to 80kph, tearing across lakes, weaving in and out of trees and flying into the air on any bumps. In other words, shattering the silence and being a nuisance to nature lovers. What fun! </p> <p>But skidoos are also practical. They come with electrically warmed handles and even a thumb warmer for the accelerator lever. \u00c5re is in fact a bit of skidoo heaven. Most houses have them and, the week we were there, \u00c5re was hosting the world skidoo championships. </p> <p>Now they didn't have that when my mum met my dad.</p> <p>Five British operators feature \u00c5re: Crystal Holidays (0870 848 7000); Neilson (08705 14 14 14); Bridge Travel Service (01992 456300); Astons (01905 829200); and Frango Travel (01428 606160).

It is a Swedish resort which is, well, full of healthy, tall, slim, fair-haired, blue-eyed Swedes who have been skiing as long as they have been walking. So not only is it very pleasing on the eye, but it also adds to the embarrassment factor for the complete skiing novice. Compared with Alpine resorts - packed with French, Italians, Germans and Japanese - the volume of Swedes makes it easy for the English: as they often speak our language better than we do. The downside is that the slopes are littered with knee-high toddler skiers, dubbed by the Swedes 'helmet footlings', who regularly dive-bomb adults at the speed of sound. When the helmet footlings are not endangering public safety, they are disturbingly well-behaved. \u00c5re attracts family groups and has lots of simple blue runs - children-only slopes - and parent-friendly facilities such as cr\u00e8ches. There are obviously more fundamental differences between Alpine and Nordic skiing - such as the snow itself. In Scandinavia, you get snow because you are far north rather than just because you are at the top of a mountain. That means you don't have to ascend in a cable car to the snow: it is everywhere around you. You can ski right into the heart of the village, pretty much down to sea level. Being so far north means that if you go in the middle of the season you get very short skiing days of only five hours or so - but then very long ones by April. It can also make it very cold - minus 30C is common in January. The sunshine is thinner and there is less risk of sunburn or altitude sickness. Because \u00c5re is not in the middle of a major mountain range, it lacks the scenic grandeur and geological drama of the Alps or Rockies. It also means the runs are shorter. The maximum altitude is just over 1,000 metres, with the longest drop in a run 850m. The snow is easily as good as the Alps - with added bizarre features. On top of the mountain, there are huge accumulations of 'blomsn ' ('cauliflower snow'), whipped into strange shapes by the often ferocious and moist Atlantic winds. With the first lift built in 1910, \u00c5re is Sweden's oldest ski resort and also its biggest. Its five interlocked villages now attract 300,000 visitors a year to its 45 different lifts and 98 pistes. It is not a resort for the daredevil professional (there are a few black slopes, but - put it like this - even I managed to get down them without falling over). To make up for this, the latest fashion is the insane ski-cross. Basically, you attempt to ski down a toboggan run with jumps added. It's like doing the Cresta run on skis and is terrifying. They have nets at every bend which I successfully got caught up in regularly. \u00c5re is the most alpine resort in Sweden, full of cutesy chalets for rent and lots of funky, hopping bars for apr\u00e9s ski or 'after ski' as the Swedes intriguingly call it. This being Sweden, one difference is the price. I saw a man buy a bottle of Bacardi with a 1000 Kr (\u00a380) note and get only a few coins for change. But despite its alpine appearance, \u00c5re is very definitely not in the Alps. Here, you are a visitor to a winter wonderland where the entire landscape and culture are based on snow. People cross-country ski and skidoo just as a way of getting around. Everywhere there is dog-sledging, ice climbing and reindeer rides. You even get reindeer wandering around the pistes. You can visit T nnforsen, Sweden's largest waterfall, suspended in icy motion. You can even go to see the oldest snow-culture of all, that of the Sami, or the Lapps as you are not meant to call them. Around 2,500 families in Sweden still subsist on reindeer and you can visit some of them in their huts, made of skin and logs, at Njarka Sami camp. There the Sami will cook you flat bread in the log fires and force-feed you weird twig-like sweets with a citrus flavour. They will also explain their reindeer culture. It was news to me that all reindeer, like cattle, are domesticated. Reindeer are quite tiny, little bigger than a Great Dane dog, and have luxuriantly soft fur. The fat in their wide flat feet remains soft even in very cold weather, making it ideal for protecting the skin. Oh, and they taste pretty good. You can go on reindeer sledge rides, which help to keep Rudolph employed outside Christmas. Or, actually, Rudolpha: male reindeers lose their antlers over Christmas, so Rudolph - who is always depicted with sparkling horns - must be female. Or if you want a bit more excitement, and don't mind farts in your face all the time, you can go dog sledging. We introduced ourselves to a team of 12 Alaskan huskies - half pure husky and, judging by their behaviour, half poodle. After extended instruction, I managed to turn the wooden sledge over in about 30 seconds, tipping my partner Paula over into the snow and dragging me along behind, desperately clinging on so I didn't lose the dogs and sledge. The dogs were the only beings around that didn't speak English and didn't understand 'Stop!' You have little control over the dogs, other than shouting instructions or braking by stamping a metal plate into the snow, which you do almost continuously, since the dogs are all eager enthusiasm, yelping, straining and running without a care - whether you have fallen off or they have just run under a low branch. It's exhilarating and you get to see the hauntingly serene winter landscape that you could otherwise see only by skiing crosscountry - or by taking the James Bond version of the dog sledge, the 85hp skidoo. We went on a 30 kilometre 'skidoo safari', at speeds of up to 80kph, tearing across lakes, weaving in and out of trees and flying into the air on any bumps. In other words, shattering the silence and being a nuisance to nature lovers. What fun! But skidoos are also practical. They come with electrically warmed handles and even a thumb warmer for the accelerator lever. \u00c5re is in fact a bit of skidoo heaven. Most houses have them and, the week we were there, \u00c5re was hosting the world skidoo championships. Now they didn't have that when my mum met my dad. Five British operators feature \u00c5re: Crystal Holidays (0870 848 7000); Neilson (08705 14 14 14); Bridge Travel Service (01992 456300); Astons (01905 829200); and Frango Travel (01428 606160). See www.skiscandinavia.com. The season runs from December until 1 May",

      "body": "<p> I would never have got to see the Tarahumara without Skip McWilliams. In the early Sixties he went down to Mexico on an old Harley; he knew Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary and hung out in Oaxaca with writers, hippies and CIA spies. One winter he went exploring in northern Mexico, through Sinaloa and across the continental divide into Chihuahua, into the immense untamed ranges of the Sierra Madre Occidental, that 'ocean of mountains' as one early explorer called it. </p> <p>Copper Canyon alone - it is really more than 20 canyons - is four times the size of the Grand Canyon, its deepest gorge a staggering 7,550ft. This was still an unexplored Mexico, inhabited by people who had little, if any, contact with outsiders. So Skip took his bike up to Creel and went walking with a rucksack and sleeping bag. And there he met the Tarahumara. </p> <p>One of the biggest native groups in the Americas, the Tarahumara are still 60,000-strong. Subsistence farmers, they grow maize and beans; some still use wooden ploughs, live in caves and treat with the world of spirits. They speak a birdlike Uto-Aztecan tongue linked to the ancient languages of central Mexico. The Aztecs always claimed they came from somewhere up here. </p> <p>In the Thirties Antonin Artaud wrote of the Tarahumara: 'These are people who live in the state before the Flood_ these are people who defy the time, who do not recognise our reality, and instead draw magical powers from the mistrust they have for our civilisation.' </p> <p>In the Sixties, in the depths of canyons, Skip found the old gods still revered: Raienari the Sun God, protector of men; Mecha the moon goddess, guardian of women. Shamans still healed and exorcised spirits, consuming peyote for festivals. Skip saw the Tarahumara play their games: lung-bursting 25-mile runs up and down canyon walls, kicking a wooden ball with bare feet. And then there was the chase: relentlessly hunting down deer, barefoot and barehanded, running them to exhaustion, driving them over cliffs on to wooden stakes. Skip ran with them, and sat up all night afterwards, listening to endless woozy music on violins and drinking tesquino, their potent maize beer. During those nights round the fire they told him proudly that they had borrowed only six things from the European world: cloth, the apple tree, the axe, the metal ploughshare, the goat - and the violin. </p> <p>Skip married and had children, but couldn't keep away. Twenty years ago he made the link permanent. With their permission he bought some land and built a lodge a few miles from Creel, astride the continental divide at nearly 8,000ft. Simple wooden huts, with no electricity: oil lamps and wood stoves in the rooms, solar panels to heat the water. Sparse but lovely. An hour's walk away you could begin trekking into fantastic gorges. The place was looked after by Tarahumara from the village nearby: the profits went back into the community. </p> <p>In the intervening years the Tarahumara became news. On the net you will find dozens of websites. But Skip's place is still run the same way. He's still based in Michigan, but when he gets a group booking he flies down from Detroit and goes with the guests on long treks, sleeping in caves, cooking out. </p> <p>He pulls his nose wryly: 'I always give them a speech at the start, so they know what they are in for. There was one group of well-heeled Bostonians: I led in some goats the first day and handed out knives. \"OK, you'd better get used to it,\" I said. \"One of the traditions here is that when you start off you cut the throat of your own animal.\" One woman burst into tears. When I told her I was kidding, she shrieked that I was the most objectionable person she had ever met. She did the trek though - and she's been back!' </p> <p>Last winter we were filming our journey in the footsteps of Cabeza de Vaca, a shipwrecked conquistador who appeared on the Pacific coast in 1536 after living more than eight years among the Indians, having walked across the continent. In his book he calls the native populations near here 'well disposed and intelligent'. He describes clothing that sounds very similar to that worn now by the Tarahumara. The Tarahumara were the nearest living connection to the cultures here in the sixteenth century. So we phoned Skip. </p> <p>'I can help, sure. But meeting people who have no contact with the outside world takes time. You'll have to trek for a few days and then sit on the edge of their land and wait for them to come to you. You can't go to them.' </p> <p>'How long will that take? </p> <p>'Could be two, three weeks. Maybe four or five. And then they might tell you to get lost.' </p> <p>'We're a film crew, Skip. We can't spare that kind of time.' </p> <p>'OK, here's a compromise. You could meet up with people I know and work with. They are prepared to take outsiders in. You won't be going deep in, but you'll still see something special.' </p> <p>We arranged to meet in Creel. There are several ways to get to there. One is the greatest railway journey in the Americas: the Copper Canyon Railway, which runs from the US border for nearly 1,000 km to the Pacific at Los Moches. It's a magical journey: the train is comfortable, the staff couldn't be more helpful; the food is good and the views wonderful. Planned back in the 1870s, the railway was finally finished in 1961. It's an amazing piece of engineering: you trundle at a sedate pace over 36 bridges and through 96 tunnels. There are delightful stopovers too: my favourite is the old Spanish colonial town of El Fuerte, which lies in a gorgeous landscape and has one of the nicest hotels you could wish for, the Hotel Posada de Hidalgo. It was somewhere near Fuerte, or so I imagined, that Cabeza de Vaca had come to 'a countryside so rich, beautiful and fertile it seemed to us there could be nowhere so beautiful in all the world'. </p> <p>We came overland from the north-east, past the spectacular native city of Casas Grandes. This is one of the great archeological sites in the Americas: a vast honeycomb of adobe, fabulous curves like abstract sculpture in the pale wintry light. Then we took the train to Creel, a little alpine town overlooked by thick pine forests and jumbled rock formations. Tarahumara were in traditional dress, men in smocks and coloured headbands, women in bright cotton skirts, cardigans and hats. There on the platform was Skip. </p> <p>It was dark by the time we reached the lodge. The December night closed in fast and chill. 'It'll soon be time for snow,' said Skip. A stove filled the room with the scent of pine. I fell asleep dreaming of snow drifts. </p> <p>We woke at dawn to a magnificent view of crags crowned with lightning-split pines and weirdly balanced boulders. After breakfast we began the trek - up all morning, down all afternoon, 3,000ft into the Cusarare canyon. As dusk settled, we struggled through huge pines down a rubble scree to a terrace above the river, cliffs towering 500ft the other side. We made our camp in front of a blackened cave. I went along the river to gather driftwood for the fire. We washed in a hot spring close by, where sometimes Tarahumara men go on their own to pass the night and reflect on the world. The women prepared the food, and night fell to the comforting slip-slap of tortillas being made. </p> <p>After the meal the coffee pots were placed in the hot embers and the tequila opened. The fireside chat came round to the pros and cons of city life. 'I've never been to Cuautemoc,' said Reyas, our Tarahumara translator. </p> <p>'I have,' said Chaparequi, the old man with the violin. </p> <p>'Did you like it?' </p> <p>He laughed shyly. 'It was very nice.' </p> <p>'Would you live there?' </p> <p>'It would be too expensive to buy land to grow corn.' </p> <p>'So what's so good about life here?' </p> <p>'Goatshit.' Laughter all round. </p> <p>'You see we use it to manure the corn. The corn grows - all plants come from God - and from it we make tortilla, pinole and tesquino. With that we have a fiesta - we dance all night and come to dawn praying in this dance - so God will benefit us.' </p> <p>They call themselves 'Raramuri', Reyes explained, which means not as usually translated 'The ones who run fast' but 'Those who walk straight'. </p> <p>Skip says this has a moral connotation. 'For them to walk straight means in all aspects of life to be fully conscious and aware of the consequences of what they do. This is a very experiential culture and as with many native American societies, some of our categories are simply meaningless to them, just as a lot of theirs are untranslatable to us. They say people who leave the canyons and go to the city are the mistaken ones because to join Western consumer society is stupid, wandering around in a daze, not understanding the point of life. To become obsessed with owning things, even naming things, is not to be masters of our own destiny.' </p> <p>'So we've forgotten how to walk straight?' I asked. </p> <p>'I'm sorry,' said Reyes, as if gently chastising an errant younger brother. 'You seem to us to be crashing about all over the place.' </p> <p>That night we all curled up together under blankets around the fire at the mouth of the cave; or inside on a thick layer of earth and ash: a chilly winter night, but we were warm under a starry sky. Chaparequi stayed half awake and fed the fire with resinous pine, whose scent wafted to the cave mouth, strong as incense. </p> <p>Over a century ago Carl Lumholtz wrote in his book Unknown Mexico that such people are becoming 'scarce on the globe' as they are 'crushed beneath the heels of civilisation'. Government plans for Copper Canyon include roads, hotels and camper sites for a projected half a million US tourists.

      "bodyText": "I would never have got to see the Tarahumara without Skip McWilliams. In the early Sixties he went down to Mexico on an old Harley; he knew Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary and hung out in Oaxaca with writers, hippies and CIA spies. One winter he went exploring in northern Mexico, through Sinaloa and across the continental divide into Chihuahua, into the immense untamed ranges of the Sierra Madre Occidental, that 'ocean of mountains' as one early explorer called it. Copper Canyon alone - it is really more than 20 canyons - is four times the size of the Grand Canyon, its deepest gorge a staggering 7,550ft. This was still an unexplored Mexico, inhabited by people who had little, if any, contact with outsiders. So Skip took his bike up to Creel and went walking with a rucksack and sleeping bag. And there he met the Tarahumara. One of the biggest native groups in the Americas, the Tarahumara are still 60,000-strong. Subsistence farmers, they grow maize and beans; some still use wooden ploughs, live in caves and treat with the world of spirits. They speak a birdlike Uto-Aztecan tongue linked to the ancient languages of central Mexico. The Aztecs always claimed they came from somewhere up here. In the Thirties Antonin Artaud wrote of the Tarahumara: 'These are people who live in the state before the Flood_ these are people who defy the time, who do not recognise our reality, and instead draw magical powers from the mistrust they have for our civilisation.' In the Sixties, in the depths of canyons, Skip found the old gods still revered: Raienari the Sun God, protector of men; Mecha the moon goddess, guardian of women. Shamans still healed and exorcised spirits, consuming peyote for festivals. Skip saw the Tarahumara play their games: lung-bursting 25-mile runs up and down canyon walls, kicking a wooden ball with bare feet. And then there was the chase: relentlessly hunting down deer, barefoot and barehanded, running them to exhaustion, driving them over cliffs on to wooden stakes. Skip ran with them, and sat up all night afterwards, listening to endless woozy music on violins and drinking tesquino, their potent maize beer. During those nights round the fire they told him proudly that they had borrowed only six things from the European world: cloth, the apple tree, the axe, the metal ploughshare, the goat - and the violin. Skip married and had children, but couldn't keep away. Twenty years ago he made the link permanent. With their permission he bought some land and built a lodge a few miles from Creel, astride the continental divide at nearly 8,000ft. Simple wooden huts, with no electricity: oil lamps and wood stoves in the rooms, solar panels to heat the water. Sparse but lovely. An hour's walk away you could begin trekking into fantastic gorges. The place was looked after by Tarahumara from the village nearby: the profits went back into the community. In the intervening years the Tarahumara became news. On the net you will find dozens of websites. But Skip's place is still run the same way. He's still based in Michigan, but when he gets a group booking he flies down from Detroit and goes with the guests on long treks, sleeping in caves, cooking out. He pulls his nose wryly: 'I always give them a speech at the start, so they know what they are in for. There was one group of well-heeled Bostonians: I led in some goats the first day and handed out knives. \"OK, you'd better get used to it,\" I said. \"One of the traditions here is that when you start off you cut the throat of your own animal.\" One woman burst into tears.

      "body": "<p>In a spartan special-visits room at Wakefield prison, Roy Shuttleworth leans across the bolted-down table and displays his most treasured possessions: letters and cards from his wife, Irene. 'My darling, innocent Roy,' one begins, 'I am as much in love with you as the day we met nearly 40 years ago. My only wish is to spend what life we have left together. I only hope nothing happens to either one of us, because I know the other will die of a broken heart.' </p> <p>As he speaks of his shattered family, he makes no attempt to hide his grief. His children, Roy junior and Suzanne, cross the Pennines from Cheshire to visit him twice a month. Now 67, the pale, broken man they find is a ghost of the jolly paterfamilias they see in family photos. This former champion swimmer, mining foreman and long-distance truck driver is serving a 10-year sentence for crimes deemed by some to be worse than murder - 11 counts of sexual assault and buggery against boys once in his care. </p> <p>From his arrest in 1995, he has protested his innocence. Although it could shorten his sentence by two years, he refuses to take the prison sex offender treatment programme: 'How can I sit there in a so-called therapy group talking about my crimes if I haven't committed them? And listening to them who has done it - it's disgusting.' </p> <p>Tonight, after five months of investigation, the BBC Panorama programme will reveal dramatic new evidence supporting Shuttleworth's claim of innocence, including evidence from former residents at the home where he worked - Greystone Heath in Warrington - who refute key elements of the prosecution case, contradicting key elements in the stories told by Shuttleworth's alleged victims. One man, confronted by huge discrepancies in his story, has now changed it beyond recognition from the version he gave in court. </p> <p>All of the eight men who made allegations against Shuttleworth have criminal records for dishonesty; three were serving seven-year sentences when they testified. Three have since allegedly disclosed they fabricated their claims for money, hoping to be awarded compensation from the government criminal injuries scheme and from civil actions against Liverpool City Council, which owned and ran Greystone Heath. The rewards from this process may run to more than \u00a3100,000 for each claimant. </p> <p>It would be deeply disturbing if Shuttleworth's story was an isolated case. But it is not. Since the time allegations of sexual abuse in care homes first surfaced in North Wales in 1991, more than 100 former care workers have been convicted and jailed for terms of up to 18 years. Some of them, perpetrators of foul and degrading crimes whose victims were long disbelieved, confessed to the police and pleaded guilty. Others, like Shuttleworth, continue to protest their innocence. </p> <p>Police investigations into care-home abuse have become an unregulated phenomenon with 90 separate inquiries under way at present, and thousands of former and serving care workers and teachers under suspicion. Officers from a single inquiry in South Wales recently announced they had more than 500 suspects. </p> <p>All are using 'the trawl' - the highly unusual method piloted in North Wales and by the Cheshire force that investigated Greystone Heath. It relies, not on victims coming forward, but on the police visiting hundreds or thousands of men once at a particular care home to discover if they were abused. Shuttleworth's solicitor, Chris Saltrese, calls it a 'begging bowl operation, a hunt for allegations'. Some of those identified this way are genuine abusers. But as Shuttleworth's case shows, it is a blunt weapon, likely to produce false allegations. </p> <p>The trawl that led to Shuttleworth's conviction began with a single allegation from a resident of Greystone Heath, a prolific offender sent there by the courts. Early in 1994 'Paul' (the law says alleged victims of sexual offences must have their identities protected) found himself in the custody of the police. He told them that nine months earlier he had been driving his car in Widnes when he saw a former Greystone worker, Alan Langshaw, leaving the magistrates' court with a boy. This, he said, brought back the horror of the sexual abuse Langshaw inflicted on him at the home during the 1970s. </p> <p>'Paul' made a statement, and in the days that followed, accused a further 17 former care workers, including Roy Shuttleworth. Without independent evidence his claims posed a serious problem for the police. However, two years earlier the media had fiercely criticised the failure of police in North Wales to bring the perpetrators of sexual abuse in local homes to justice. The Cheshire officers talking to 'Paul' did not want to expose themselves to similar attacks. The force decided to set up a major investigation - Operation Granite. </p> <p>Using health, prison and benefit records, the police traced hundreds of former Greystone residents. At least 1,000 made statements, though only a small minority claimed they were victims. When the police arrested Langshaw, he confessed almost immediately and was finally jailed for eight years. Langshaw's Greystone Heath contemporary, Roy Shuttleworth, was a different matter. </p> <p>There were striking differences. Langshaw, a gay single man, had a private flat at Greystone Heath where he could lock the door and do as he pleased with his victims, immune from scrutiny. Shuttleworth lived on the campus with his wife and children. He had come into care work in his forties, when his wife Irene, sick of his absences driving HGVs, persuaded him to apply for a joint post as houseparents. The couple did everything together. Why such a man would want to abuse young boys is a matter for psychologists. How he could have done so is a crucial question on which his proof of innocence turns. </p> <p>The vital principle which trawl inquiries must follow is to avoid 'leading' potential witnesses by planting ideas in their minds. Professor Mike McConville of Warwick University, an authority on miscarriages of justice, tells tonight's Panorama how easy it is to generate a false allegation in this way. The police, he points out, do not simply record what interviewees say: they write up their statements from lengthy question and answer sessions, and it is impossible to tell the spontaneous account from one which has been suggested. </p> <p>By telling interviewees they were investigating sexual abuse and reminding them of the names of care staff, detectives could sow the seeds of a wrongful conviction. McConville believes that introducing mandatory taping of all detective-witness encounters in trawl investigations is urgently needed. </p> <p>When talks with police generate untrue statements, says McConville, the witness will almost invariably 'adopt' the misleading account as his own. In the present climate, a wrongly accused care worker is the deadly foe. </p> <p>Panorama's investigation revealed that this process was at work in Operation Granite. A former Greystone inmate who left the home seven years before Shuttleworth began to work there in 1974 made a graphic statement, describing how Shuttleworth had forced him to masturbate him in the shower. The man sticks to his account now, insisting that Shuttleworth abused him. But the man got Shuttleworth's name from the police who descended 'out of the blue' one day in 1995. The detectives, he says, showed him photographs of Shuttleworth and told him they were investigating claims he was a paedophile. </p> <p>The case reveals a second, deadly way in which wrongful convictions can be generated by trawls - the lure of compensation. After the man had made his statement, the police suggested he see a solicitor. He went to Abney Garsden McDonald in Cheadle, which by early 1995 was co-ordinating actions for damages on behalf of alleged abuse victims throughout the North-West. (Today there are more than 700 claimants in these actions, all funded by legal aid, 350 of whom the Cheadle firm represents.) </p> <p>The lawyers told him he had two ways of making a claim: the Government criminal injuries compensation scheme, and a civil action against Greystone's operators, Liverpool City Council. He began to pursue both courses. Only then did the police realise the discrepancy over dates, forcing him to withdraw from both the criminal and civil legal process. </p> <p>The police have taken an unusually close interest in the compensation aspect of the case. Senior officers visited the government scheme's Glasgow headquarters and persuaded them to waive the normal three-year time limit for claimants. They also had meetings with Peter Garsden, Abney Garsden McDonald's lead partner in the abuse cases, and with other lawyers involved in the civil actions. </p> <p>'It very quickly became apparent that it was important for us and the police to have a symbiotic relationship,' Garsden says. 'For example, the police would want us to refer any new complaints of abuse that they didn't know about to them, because it would help them in their process. We depended on them, because we wanted as much information about the pending criminal trials as possible.' </p> <p>Garsden also appointed a 'press relations officer' who succeeded in getting articles placed in the local media which made it clear that victims might be able to claim thousands of pounds in damages. A former Greystone resident, Eric Oldham, went to the firm and lodged a claim after seeing this publicity. Only after he had made his statement for the lawyers did he agree to talk to the police. </p> <p>In McConville's eyes, this relationship between criminal and civil justice was risky. 'You cannot have a cheque book investigation in a criminal case. Victims can be legitimately assisted in pursuing compensation, that's one thing, but you must not have the issue of compensation colouring their accounts.' </p> <p>In some cases, the relation between lawyers and police has been closer still. 'The police have been very helpful,' says solicitor Keith Robinson, handling over 100 abuse claims. 'I have had several clients who have been referred to me by officers. They will often supply important documents, such as unused material from a trial and supporting evidence.' </p> <p>A third and final factor made the position in which Shuttleworth found himself more perilous still. </p> <p>In 1991, a House of Lords judgment in the case known as Director of Public Prosecutions versus P changed the law. Normally, an allegation of a criminal offence has to stand or fall on its own merits: if a witness accusing someone of sexual abuse was sufficiently credible, or could adduce supporting evidence, then an abuser would be convicted. Until 1991, multiple allegations against the same person could only be held to be mutually corroborating if there were 'striking similarities' between the alleged crimes, indicating a criminal's 'signature,' a distinct modus operandi. But the judgment removed this protection. In effect, the courts have accepted the idea of 'corroboration by volume'. </p> <p>Peter Garsden insists that every allegation in the 700 cases he is co-ordinating is true, because nobody would be prepared to put up with the unpleasant business of giving evidence unless they were telling the truth. He further believes he is, literally, fighting the forces of Satan: 'I believe that we're messing with the Devil, because you know, child abuse is evil, and the people that get involved in it are powerful, manipulative people. And they will do their level best to stop us succeeding and stop us getting justice for the victims.' </p> <p>Garsden, who is also executive officer of the national Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, says that even when discrepancies occur between allegations and known facts, this doesn't cast doubt on their story: their memory may have deceived them over some of the details, but the one thing they will always remember is how they were abused, and by whom. </p> <p>Lesley Cohen from Nottingham, who has prepared reports for more than 100 victims disagreed. 'You cannot tell from using a psychometric assessment whether a person has experienced [the abuse] they're talking about.' </p> <p>The seven men who gave evidence accusing Shuttleworth all made criminal injuries claims, most before his trial; all have also lodged civil actions. One already had been convicted and jailed in 1991 for conspiracy to defraud the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. </p> <p>A psychiatric assessment dating from 1983 described this claimant as 'unable to separate fact from fantasy'. Nevertheless, as the trial opened at Chester Crown Court in May 1996, the police were convinced that he and the other men were telling the truth. </p> <p>Shuttleworth's defence scored important points. For example, faced with the difficulty that Shuttleworth had no private space to take his supposed victims, the complainants claimed they'd been abused in public parts of the home. One, 'Dave', said he had a key to the swimming pool where he worked alone as a cleaner and Shuttleworth used to abuse him there. </p> <p>Peter McCudden, the former head of PE, said this was untrue: there were only two keys to the swimming pool, guarded religiously by himself and the duty head, and anyone found alone there would be banned from the pool for life. The discrepancies were ignored by the jury. The judge described the men as 'coming forward', and asked the jury to consider how they could have made their claims independently unless they were true. But they had not 'come forward'. </p> <p>Panorama tested 'Dave's' story further. He also claimed that Shuttleworth used to wake him in the dormitory and take him away to abuse him at night. We traced two of his former room-mates, both of whom insisted such a thing was impossible: they would have known. They denied Dave's claim that one of them had also been abused. One, abused by Langshaw, is now a successful entrepreneur who asked to remain anonymous. He said: 'No, no, not in this world, no, no, never - Shuttleworth never did anything to me.' </p> <p>This was nothing to the unravelling of the claims of another witness - 'Jim'. He claimed he was assaulted one afternoon in the shower in a brutal attack which ended in buggery and lasted for 10 to 15 minutes. Finally, he said, he pushed Shuttleworth off him, banging his head against the shower door, and ran wrapped in a towel to the headmaster's office. </p> <p>But 'Jim' would have had to run 400 yards in full view of the road and passers-by who used Greystone Heath as a short cut - on his account, crying, screaming and bleeding from his anus. Unfortunately, the trial never heard crucial details of the evening shower routine which cast further doubt: the shower was open, with no door against which Shuttleworth could bang his head. The boys showered together in a tightly supervised regimen, with two staff patrolling. 'There was never any stragglers,' says Lee Fielding, once 'Jim's' best friend. </p> <p>Confronted by Panorama with these discrepancies, Jim changed his story: the attack, he said, lasted only 'a matter of seconds'; and he was no longer sure whether he had been penetrated. His one-time friend Lee then asked how he could have left the building, because the doors were always locked. 'Jim' claimed he jumped from a first-floor window - a detail he never mentioned before. Last week we went back to Greystone Heath and found - as Lee had told us - that the windows were restrained by metal brackets, and could not open more than three inches. 'Oh, aye,' 'Jim' said. 'I was skinny in them days.' Our inquiries found problems with the evidence of all the witnesses. The more we checked it, the more it fell apart. </p> <p>Some of this fresh evidence was available when Shuttleworth applied for leave to appeal in 1999. The most dramatic example was the story of 'Tony,' who claimed Shuttleworth bent him over his bed and started to bugger him, and that he screamed and bit Shuttleworth's finger so hard he fell to the floor in agony. He claimed that another care worker, Phil Fiddler, was drawn by the commotion and was told by Shuttleworth (with trousers, presumably, at half-mast) that 'Tony' had attacked him. </p> <p>In 1997, 'Tony' gave evidence in Fiddler's own trial. This time he claimed that Fiddler bent him over his bed and started to bugger him, and that he screamed and bit Fiddler's finger so hard he fell to the floor in agony. Drawn by the commotion, he said another care worker, Ted Tipton, entered the room and Fiddler told him (with trousers, presumably, at half-mast) that 'Tony' had attacked him. Fiddler's jury acquitted him of all charges. It was a carbon copy of the evidence against Shuttleworth. As Fiddler's barrister told the court, he had to be lying. In tonight's Panorama, another former Greystone resident who met 'Tony' in prison describes how he boasted that he was making false allegations for money, adding: 'You should try it yourself.' </p> <p>At about the same time as Fiddler's trial, Shuttleworth's solicitor, Chris Saltrese, traced 'Paul', the man whose claims had first triggered Operation Granite. He admitted he had fabricated his allegations against Shuttleworth, and agreed to consider making a statement saying so. However, after consulting his lawyer, he declined. He is still claiming compensation - although by the time of Shuttleworth's trial, the police had decided not to call him as a witness. The reason, an internal police memo records, was that 'doubts must be cast on his competence as a credible prosecution witness'. </p> <p>Shuttleworth was refused leave to appeal. Last year Irene suffered a heart attack and died. Shuttleworth was allowed to throw a handful of earth on her coffin handcuffed to a prison officer. </p> <p>'My life is in fragments,' he says. 'I am in darkness. What those men's lies have taken away can never be put back. All there is left is to clear my name.' </p> <p>\u0095 Panorama's investigation, In the Name of the Children, is on BBC1 tonight at 10.15.</p>",

The detectives, he says, showed him photographs of Shuttleworth and told him they were investigating claims he was a paedophile. The case reveals a second, deadly way in which wrongful convictions can be generated by trawls - the lure of compensation. After the man had made his statement, the police suggested he see a solicitor. He went to Abney Garsden McDonald in Cheadle, which by early 1995 was co-ordinating actions for damages on behalf of alleged abuse victims throughout the North-West. (Today there are more than 700 claimants in these actions, all funded by legal aid, 350 of whom the Cheadle firm represents.) The lawyers told him he had two ways of making a claim: the Government criminal injuries compensation scheme, and a civil action against Greystone's operators, Liverpool City Council. He began to pursue both courses. Only then did the police realise the discrepancy over dates, forcing him to withdraw from both the criminal and civil legal process. The police have taken an unusually close interest in the compensation aspect of the case. Senior officers visited the government scheme's Glasgow headquarters and persuaded them to waive the normal three-year time limit for claimants. They also had meetings with Peter Garsden, Abney Garsden McDonald's lead partner in the abuse cases, and with other lawyers involved in the civil actions. 'It very quickly became apparent that it was important for us and the police to have a symbiotic relationship,' Garsden says. 'For example, the police would want us to refer any new complaints of abuse that they didn't know about to them, because it would help them in their process. We depended on them, because we wanted as much information about the pending criminal trials as possible.' Garsden also appointed a 'press relations officer' who succeeded in getting articles placed in the local media which made it clear that victims might be able to claim thousands of pounds in damages. A former Greystone resident, Eric Oldham, went to the firm and lodged a claim after seeing this publicity. Only after he had made his statement for the lawyers did he agree to talk to the police. In McConville's eyes, this relationship between criminal and civil justice was risky. 'You cannot have a cheque book investigation in a criminal case. Victims can be legitimately assisted in pursuing compensation, that's one thing, but you must not have the issue of compensation colouring their accounts.' In some cases, the relation between lawyers and police has been closer still. 'The police have been very helpful,' says solicitor Keith Robinson, handling over 100 abuse claims. 'I have had several clients who have been referred to me by officers. They will often supply important documents, such as unused material from a trial and supporting evidence.' A third and final factor made the position in which Shuttleworth found himself more perilous still. In 1991, a House of Lords judgment in the case known as Director of Public Prosecutions versus P changed the law. Normally, an allegation of a criminal offence has to stand or fall on its own merits: if a witness accusing someone of sexual abuse was sufficiently credible, or could adduce supporting evidence, then an abuser would be convicted. Until 1991, multiple allegations against the same person could only be held to be mutually corroborating if there were 'striking similarities' between the alleged crimes, indicating a criminal's 'signature,' a distinct modus operandi. But the judgment removed this protection. In effect, the courts have accepted the idea of 'corroboration by volume'. Peter Garsden insists that every allegation in the 700 cases he is co-ordinating is true, because nobody would be prepared to put up with the unpleasant business of giving evidence unless they were telling the truth. He further believes he is, literally, fighting the forces of Satan: 'I believe that we're messing with the Devil, because you know, child abuse is evil, and the people that get involved in it are powerful, manipulative people. And they will do their level best to stop us succeeding and stop us getting justice for the victims.' Garsden, who is also executive officer of the national Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, says that even when discrepancies occur between allegations and known facts, this doesn't cast doubt on their story: their memory may have deceived them over some of the details, but the one thing they will always remember is how they were abused, and by whom. Lesley Cohen from Nottingham, who has prepared reports for more than 100 victims disagreed. 'You cannot tell from using a psychometric assessment whether a person has experienced [the abuse] they're talking about.' The seven men who gave evidence accusing Shuttleworth all made criminal injuries claims, most before his trial; all have also lodged civil actions. One already had been convicted and jailed in 1991 for conspiracy to defraud the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. A psychiatric assessment dating from 1983 described this claimant as 'unable to separate fact from fantasy'. Nevertheless, as the trial opened at Chester Crown Court in May 1996, the police were convinced that he and the other men were telling the truth. Shuttleworth's defence scored important points. For example, faced with the difficulty that Shuttleworth had no private space to take his supposed victims, the complainants claimed they'd been abused in public parts of the home. One, 'Dave', said he had a key to the swimming pool where he worked alone as a cleaner and Shuttleworth used to abuse him there. Peter McCudden, the former head of PE, said this was untrue: there were only two keys to the swimming pool, guarded religiously by himself and the duty head, and anyone found alone there would be banned from the pool for life. The discrepancies were ignored by the jury. The judge described the men as 'coming forward', and asked the jury to consider how they could have made their claims independently unless they were true. But they had not 'come forward'. Panorama tested 'Dave's' story further. He also claimed that Shuttleworth used to wake him in the dormitory and take him away to abuse him at night. We traced two of his former room-mates, both of whom insisted such a thing was impossible: they would have known. They denied Dave's claim that one of them had also been abused. One, abused by Langshaw, is now a successful entrepreneur who asked to remain anonymous. He said: 'No, no, not in this world, no, no, never - Shuttleworth never did anything to me.' This was nothing to the unravelling of the claims of another witness - 'Jim'. He claimed he was assaulted one afternoon in the shower in a brutal attack which ended in buggery and lasted for 10 to 15 minutes. Finally, he said, he pushed Shuttleworth off him, banging his head against the shower door, and ran wrapped in a towel to the headmaster's office. But 'Jim' would have had to run 400 yards in full view of the road and passers-by who used Greystone Heath as a short cut - on his account, crying, screaming and bleeding from his anus. Unfortunately, the trial never heard crucial details of the evening shower routine which cast further doubt: the shower was open, with no door against which Shuttleworth could bang his head. The boys showered together in a tightly supervised regimen, with two staff patrolling. 'There was never any stragglers,' says Lee Fielding, once 'Jim's' best friend. Confronted by Panorama with these discrepancies, Jim changed his story: the attack, he said, lasted only 'a matter of seconds'; and he was no longer sure whether he had been penetrated. His one-time friend Lee then asked how he could have left the building, because the doors were always locked. 'Jim' claimed he jumped from a first-floor window - a detail he never mentioned before. Last week we went back to Greystone Heath and found - as Lee had told us - that the windows were restrained by metal brackets, and could not open more than three inches. 'Oh, aye,' 'Jim' said. 'I was skinny in them days.' Our inquiries found problems with the evidence of all the witnesses. The more we checked it, the more it fell apart. Some of this fresh evidence was available when Shuttleworth applied for leave to appeal in 1999. The most dramatic example was the story of 'Tony,' who claimed Shuttleworth bent him over his bed and started to bugger him, and that he screamed and bit Shuttleworth's finger so hard he fell to the floor in agony. He claimed that another care worker, Phil Fiddler, was drawn by the commotion and was told by Shuttleworth (with trousers, presumably, at half-mast) that 'Tony' had attacked him. In 1997, 'Tony' gave evidence in Fiddler's own trial. This time he claimed that Fiddler bent him over his bed and started to bugger him, and that he screamed and bit Fiddler's finger so hard he fell to the floor in agony. Drawn by the commotion, he said another care worker, Ted Tipton, entered the room and Fiddler told him (with trousers, presumably, at half-mast) that 'Tony' had attacked him. Fiddler's jury acquitted him of all charges. It was a carbon copy of the evidence against Shuttleworth. As Fiddler's barrister told the court, he had to be lying. In tonight's Panorama, another former Greystone resident who met 'Tony' in prison describes how he boasted that he was making false allegations for money, adding: 'You should try it yourself.' At about the same time as Fiddler's trial, Shuttleworth's solicitor, Chris Saltrese, traced 'Paul', the man whose claims had first triggered Operation Granite. He admitted he had fabricated his allegations against Shuttleworth, and agreed to consider making a statement saying so. However, after consulting his lawyer, he declined. He is still claiming compensation - although by the time of Shuttleworth's trial, the police had decided not to call him as a witness. The reason, an internal police memo records, was that 'doubts must be cast on his competence as a credible prosecution witness'. Shuttleworth was refused leave to appeal. Last year Irene suffered a heart attack and died. Shuttleworth was allowed to throw a handful of earth on her coffin handcuffed to a prison officer. 'My life is in fragments,' he says. 'I am in darkness. What those men's lies have taken away can never be put back. All there is left is to clear my name.' \u0095 Panorama's investigation, In the Name of the Children, is on BBC1 tonight at 10.15.",

Police are investigating the English Volunteer Force (EVF), which organises racial harassment at matches involving England and the south London club, Charlton Athletic. The group has attacked rival fans near The Valley, Charlton's ground, and is active on the fringe of racist England fans who cause trouble abroad. Its literature bears a swastika and boasts that they are 'fucking racists'. Charlton is one of several clubs where black players suffered racist abuse last weekend. Fans who made monkey noises at Chelsea's Marcel Desailly are thought to be EVF members. Norwich City fan Peter Bloomfield was fined \u00a3250 and banned from domestic football for three years after he hurled racist jibes at Bolton Wanderers' Michael Ricketts when he scored. At the FA Cup tie between Ilkeston Town and Swindon Town, several hundred home supporters subjected visiting black players to similar taunts. In some incidents this season several thousand fans have taken part in racist chanting, systematically bar racked black players and sung xenophobic songs. Campaigners claim such incidents disprove claims - voiced by Emile Heskey, the black Liverpool and England striker, among others - that black players now only suffer abuse abroad. Piara Power, co-ordinator of the Premier League-backed Kick Racism Out of Football campaign, said: 'Racism is a huge problem in parts of Europe...

Joint articles written by such senior members of the two governments are rare and reveal the importance Blair and Clinton put on getting a positive message about the reaction force across. Blair and Cook agreed to approach Washington about the article at the EU summit at Zagreb last week. A Foreign Office source said the Government was 'wholly wedded' to keeping the European debate in the headlines in the run-up to the Nice summit next week. 'We have nothing to be afraid of,' the source said. 'As long as we are leading the agenda and not leaving it to the Eurosceptics to run this debate.' Russia has now also backed the new force. The moves came as fresh doubts were raised about the chief of defence staff's support for the force. General Sir Charles Guthrie, the head of the army who has been embroiled in the controversy over the EU plans, was reported to have told a private meeting of MPs 11 days ago that it would be easier to promote European defence within Nato rather than creating a separate European force. Guthrie has publicly backed Blair's plans but his private comments appear to reveal new fears within the army. He is said to have told MPs that the EU force was a 'political idea' rather than one driven by the military. In a further twist, Blair's leading political guru has admitted that the EU should hand back some powers to the nation state and should get away from backroom deals and old-boy networks if it is to gain public support. In a significant intervention, Professor Anthony Giddens, who Blair has said is one of the most important influences on his political thinking, said it was time for the EU to reform its institutions and become more democratic. 'A transfer of authority downwards, including the handing back of some powers to nations or localities, should surely be basic to the future evolution of the EU,' Giddens writes in an article to be published by the Foreign Policy Centre this week. Giddens attacks not only the institutions of the EU but also domestic parliaments for not giving the public enough information about how they operate. 'Existing political structures, even the most democratic of them, are not democratic enough in a globalising information age,' says Giddens, director of the London School of Economics.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Jilly Cooper</strong><br></p> <p> Anyone wanting an introduction to the lunacy, avarice and sexual merry-go-round of the New York contemporary art scene should read <strong> Danny Moynihan's </strong> marvellously funny and accomplished novel, <strong> Boogie Woogie</strong> (Duckworth). Having run galleries, curated and exhibited himself, Moynihan knows everything about bent dealers, pretentious collectors and thrusting young artists. All the characters are so awful that one ends up very fond of the less awful ones. </p> <p><strong>Katherine Whitehorn</strong><br> </p> <p> I usually read paperbacks, so my books of the year are mostly last year's - and the best novel, <strong> The Homemaker </strong>by <strong>Dorothy Canfield Fisher</strong>, was resurrected from 1924 by Persephone Books. This is about a miserably obsessive housewife who is able to take a satisfying job only when her husband is crippled. However, I enjoyed <strong> The Pale Abyssinian </strong> (HarperCollins), <strong> Miles Bredin's </strong> witty biography of James Bruce, the preposterous Scot who discovered the source of the White Nile, and <strong> Yvonne Roberts </strong> 's gripping novel, <strong> A History of Insects</strong> (Headline) about residual snobbery in Pakistan after the Raj. </p> <p><strong>Paul Bailey</strong><br> </p> <p> I found<strong> Victoria Clark's </strong> study of the Orthodox Church in Europe, <strong> Why Angels Fall </strong> (Macmillan), absolutely engrossing. The book provides insights into a Christian religion notably different from either Roman Catholicism or Protestantism. The novel that most impressed me was <strong> Alasdair MacLeod's No Great Mischief </strong> (Cape), a haunting family history set in the wilds of Canada and the Scottish Highlands. <strong> Lorna Sage's </strong> memoir of her nightmarish childhood, <strong> Bad Blood</strong> (Fourth Estate) is funny, moving, and wonderfully written. In <strong> The Million Dollar Mermaid by Esther Williams with Digby Diehl </strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster), the aquatic film star says of her third husband, the relentlessly priapic Fernando Lamas, 'He talked about his penis as if it were a dear and talented friend, with excellent posture.' Thanks to Digby, Esther's autobiography is crammed with similar memorable conceits. </p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Rose</strong><br> </p> <p> Both my books this year come from or return to South Africa. <strong> Gillian Slovo's Red Dust </strong> (Virago) transforms South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with extraordinary skill, into an impossible-to-put-down detective story so that the reader is forced to enter the minds of all sides of the apartheid era, oppressor and victim alike. <strong> Marlene Van Neikerk's </strong> prize-winning Afrikaans novel <strong> Triomf </strong> (Little,Brown) rescues for South African literature the forgotten white trash of the country, while presenting its staggeringly dysfunctional, sometimes inspired, family in such uncompromising terms that Coetzee's Disgrace seems positively redemptive in comparison. </p> <p><strong>David Cannadine</strong><br> </p> <p> Here are three books which should stimulate and divert the mind over the seasonal shutdown.<strong> Michael Howard's The Invention of Peace: Reflections on War and International Order</strong> (Profile) distils a lifetime's learning by our greatest military historian. <strong> John Simpson's A Mad World, My Masters: Tales from a Traveller's Life</strong> (Macmillan) is by turns hilarious and horrifying. And <strong> Simon Schama's A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC) is a bravura performance by the Lord Macaulay of our day. </p> <p><strong>Paul Muldoon</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the best books of poetry of the past year was <strong> Derek Mahon's Selected Poems</strong> (Penguin). Among numerous other distinctions, Mahon is the single most effective manager of the long stanza since Philip Larkin, as is clear from such anthology pieces as 'A Disused Shed in County Wexford' and 'A Garage in County Cork'. </p> <p><strong>Kathy Lette</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Mortimer</strong> is in his anecdotage and his autobiographical <strong> The Summer of a Dormouse </strong> (Viking), a mix of warmth, wit and wisdom is my book of the year. Whether ruminating on Napoleon's dick, the poor bastard who was jailed for sleeping with his own wife while wearing a beard, the Princess and the dipsomaniac Irish undertaker or the Swede caught spanking his wife with a live eel (and fined for cruelty to animals), the mischievous Mortimer weaves comedy and compassion into his prose. </p> <p><strong>Simon Callow</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Tom Phillips's </strong> millennium project, <strong> The Postcard Century</strong> (Thames &amp; Hudson) is an inexhaustibly fascinating account of private lives and public images over the past 100 years, as intimate and authentic an account of the experience of being alive at that time as we shall ever have. <strong> Thomas Wright's Oscar Wilde: Table Talk</strong> (Cassell) suggests more than anything else in print what it was like to hear the great man do what he did better than anyone: talk. </p> <p><strong>John Mortimer</strong><br> </p> <p> A plot which involves two alleged Lord Lucans and a lady psychiatrist who faked the stigmata could only have gestated in the fertile brain of <strong> Muriel Spark</strong>.<strong> Aiding and Abetting</strong> (Viking) is written with the meticulous sparkle which makes her prose the envy of contemporary writers. We live at a time when we seem to be determined to cut ourselves off from our history, a fatal tendency that might be cured by <strong> Simon Schama's </strong> excitingly readable <strong> A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC), full of kings and battles, puts an end to the fashionable idea that history should only be studied in the lives of medieval bakers or eighteenth-century piano tuners. Finally, the English obsession with verdant and manicured lawns is entertainingly weeded and watered in <strong> Tom Fort's The Grass is Greener: Our Love Affair with the Lawn</strong> (HarperCollins). It contains one of the best descriptions of a potting shed ever written. </p> <p><strong>Adam Mars-Jones</strong><br> </p> <p> The novel and the book of stories I most enjoyed this year are both products of creative Indian summers: <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) and <strong> Penelope Fitzgerald's The Means of Escape</strong> (Flamingo). Roth's novel addresses with subtlety the issues of sex, race, identity. Fitzgerald, whose death this year ends a brilliant literary career that began when she was 60, constantly brushes up against profundity without ever seeming to have designs on it. A striking debut collection of stories was <strong> Never Trust A Rabbit </strong> by<strong> Jeremy Dyson</strong> (Duckworth). His stories nestle in the little vacant chink between Roald Dahl and Borges. <strong> Jeremy Seabrook's Love in a Different Climate: Men Who Have Sex with Men in India</strong> (Verso) is illuminating - an attempt to describe taboo experience without imposing Western assumptions. </p> <p><strong>Stephen Bayley</strong><br> </p> <p> I checked and I haven't actually read anything in the Amazon Hot 100. Not even The Thunderbirds Colouring Book, or David Beckham: My World. It's been a thin year for good books. Certainly, no fiction that sticks. I devoured <strong> Michael Lewis's The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story </strong> (Coronet), a pacy romp around the idiot-savant computer geek Jim Clark, but it's really just a long article, like so many US business books. Two late 1999 publications that have real value are <strong> James Campbell's This is the Beat Generation</strong> (Secker &amp; Warburg) , an excellent popular history of Kerouac, Ginsberg and their dissolute company, and the re-issue by Books &amp; Co/Helen Marx Books of <strong> Iris Origo's </strong> gloriously elegant 1953 life: <strong> Leopardi - A Study in Solitude</strong>. This last has a new introduction by <strong> Shirley Hazzard</strong> whose miniature <strong> Greene on Capri</strong> (Virago) was a small pleasure, full of fine observation and detail. But best of all has been <strong> City Secrets: Rome</strong> (The Little Bookroom) edited by <strong> Robert Kahn</strong>. This is a straightforward compilation of art, architecture and restaurant tips by people who really know the city: it's cruelly tempting, insightful and inspiring, as well as being nicely designed. The ordinary thing done extraordinary well: I'd never lend my copy, it's always in use. </p> <p><strong>Melvyn Bragg</strong><br></p> <p> The latest collection of <strong> Alan Jenkins's </strong> poems,<strong> The Drift</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus), is stunningly good. Full of passionate regret, clear, erudite, both a chronicle of the poet's time and a comment on it in poems as fine as any being written today. It is some sort of minor miracle that <strong> Michael Donaghy's </strong> masterly collection comes out in the same year as Jenkins. <strong> Conjure </strong> (Picador) contains poems which are as deeply structured, as lucid, moving and witty as Auden at his best. He brings powerful forces to bear on the memory of deep attachments and his vivid story-telling sense is a marvel. <strong> Adam Phillips's Promises, Promises: Essays on Psychoanalysis and Literature</strong> (Faber) is a brilliant collection of essays around the subjects in which disciplines Phillips excels. </p> <p> <strong>Rowan Pelling</strong><br></p> <p> I have just started the book which I have waited patiently for all year - <strong>Philip Pullman's</strong> finale to his 'Dark Materials' trilogy,<strong> The Amber Spyglass</strong>. After only 20 pages I find myself spellbound by Pullman's storytelling. All my godchildren will receive the complete hardback set for Christmas.</p> <p> <strong>Ian Hislop</strong><br></p> <p> Having been a judge in the recent Blue Peter Book Awards, I have read a lot more children's fiction this year than anything aimed at adults. This probably explains why most of the books have seemed so well-written and entertaining. Can I recommend <strong>The Shadow of the Minotaur by Alan Gibbons</strong> (Dolphin Paperback) and <strong>Pilgrim's Progress by Geraldine McCaughrean</strong> (Hodder)? You should probably find a child to give them to, but you could do a lot worse than read them yourself first.</p> <p> <strong>Philip Hensher</strong><br></p> <p> The novels I liked best this year were<strong> Jane Smiley's</strong> grand, detailed <strong>Horse Heaven</strong> (Faber), one of those books which seems interested in absolutely everything, and <strong>Patrick McGrath's Martha Peake</strong> (Viking). He is a one-off; someone who has infused the tawdry old genre of the Gothic novel with a showy, enchanting intelligence. I simply could not put down <strong>John Drummond's</strong> entertainingly poisonous memoirs, <strong>Tainted By Experience</strong> (Faber). <strong>Graham Robb's life of Rimbaud</strong> (Picador) was unfailingly good; a calm, sceptical eye turned on a turbulent life. <strong>Helen Simpson's</strong> collection <strong>Hey Yeah Right Get A Life</strong> (Cape) was simply brilliant. Individual stories gave only a suggestion of the cumulative, terrifying force of the whole book. She has always been funny; with this, she displays herself a writer of unusual power. </p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>More pensioners died from cold last winter than during any winter since 1976. If latest weather predictions are correct, the death toll this winter will be even worse. </p> <p>Almost 55,000 people died from cold-related illnesses between last December and March, new figures from the Office of National Statistics reveal. The figures will acutely embarrass Ministers who had pledged to end pensioner poverty. </p> <p>'It's a tragedy that people in Britain are still literally freezing to death and a main reason is poverty,' said Ben Harding of Help the Aged. 'We deal with thousands of cases where older people can't meet the costs of heating their home. They need heat all day and sometimes at night and are particularly vulnerable.' </p> <p>'I simply can't afford to heat my flat properly,' says 89-year old Sue Williams from Battersea in south London. She has two small gas fires but no central heating. 'I usually sit with a hot water bottle during the day if it's cold. I'm terribly afraid of the bills coming in. </p> <p>'When I finally have to pay a bill I usually go without shopping for a week. I scrape around with what's in the kitchen,' explains Mrs Williams, who has no savings and manages on about \u00a390 a week. </p> <p>On Christmas Day last year, William Gallagher, a retired miner from Clackmannanshire, froze to death in his bed when his wife found that the \u00a35 card she had bought to restore power was not enough to reconnect their electricity. They owed \u00a320. Mrs Gallagher did not approach neighbours until she had sat with her husband's body for 24 hours. </p> <p>Albert Smith from Norfolk is 82. He fought in Africa and was then a postman for 40 years. 'There's no point hiding the fact that I'm frightened of winter. My doctor has told me firmly to have the heating on whenever I need it, but that's simply not possible. </p> <p>'When I'm moving around it's fine, but if I sit down and rest I start to feel the temperature badly. Last winter was particularly unpleasant. Our \u00a3200 winter fuel allowance does make a difference and I'm delighted that we're going to get it,' said Mr Smith, 'but it certainly won't pay what I need to heat the house.' </p> <p>The winter fuel payment was increased to \u00a3200 in Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement two weeks ago. </p> <p>Harding of Help the Aged said: 'It's now well-established that the surge in winter deaths is connected very closely with cold-related illnesses such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Every degree the outside temperature falls below freezing adds about 2 per cent to the death rate.' </p> <p>Last week, weather forecasts predicted a January of snow and ice, with inland temperatures falling as low as -10 C, a cold snap which could mean disaster for thousands more pensioners. </p> <p>Paul Wilkinson, who has researched winter deaths for Harding's charity and British Gas, said: 'Last year in the depth of winter, there were 54 per cent more deaths in Britain than in the summer. The key factor is undoubtedly the cold. If you look at figures from Scandinavia, you see what a big contrast there is. Our winters are milder and Scandinavian winters are colder, but the number of deaths there is much lower than in the UK.' </p> <p>MP Steve Webb, social security spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: 'The Government really can't pretend that the winter fuel payments scheme is the answer because these deaths when pensioners were already receiving a winter payment of \u00a3100. It's a question of overall pensioner poverty.' </p> <p>Two years ago, during a mild winter, deaths from cold were just 25,630. But if January is as cold as predicted, the figure could rise to 70,000. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

'It's a tragedy that people in Britain are still literally freezing to death and a main reason is poverty,' said Ben Harding of Help the Aged. 'We deal with thousands of cases where older people can't meet the costs of heating their home. They need heat all day and sometimes at night and are particularly vulnerable.' 'I simply can't afford to heat my flat properly,' says 89-year old Sue Williams from Battersea in south London. She has two small gas fires but no central heating. 'I usually sit with a hot water bottle during the day if it's cold. I'm terribly afraid of the bills coming in. 'When I finally have to pay a bill I usually go without shopping for a week. I scrape around with what's in the kitchen,' explains Mrs Williams, who has no savings and manages on about \u00a390 a week. On Christmas Day last year, William Gallagher, a retired miner from Clackmannanshire, froze to death in his bed when his wife found that the \u00a35 card she had bought to restore power was not enough to reconnect their electricity. They owed \u00a320. Mrs Gallagher did not approach neighbours until she had sat with her husband's body for 24 hours. Albert Smith from Norfolk is 82. He fought in Africa and was then a postman for 40 years. 'There's no point hiding the fact that I'm frightened of winter. My doctor has told me firmly to have the heating on whenever I need it, but that's simply not possible. 'When I'm moving around it's fine, but if I sit down and rest I start to feel the temperature badly. Last winter was particularly unpleasant. Our \u00a3200 winter fuel allowance does make a difference and I'm delighted that we're going to get it,' said Mr Smith, 'but it certainly won't pay what I need to heat the house.' The winter fuel payment was increased to \u00a3200 in Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement two weeks ago. Harding of Help the Aged said: 'It's now well-established that the surge in winter deaths is connected very closely with cold-related illnesses such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Every degree the outside temperature falls below freezing adds about 2 per cent to the death rate.' Last week, weather forecasts predicted a January of snow and ice, with inland temperatures falling as low as -10 C, a cold snap which could mean disaster for thousands more pensioners. Paul Wilkinson, who has researched winter deaths for Harding's charity and British Gas, said: 'Last year in the depth of winter, there were 54 per cent more deaths in Britain than in the summer. The key factor is undoubtedly the cold. If you look at figures from Scandinavia, you see what a big contrast there is. Our winters are milder and Scandinavian winters are colder, but the number of deaths there is much lower than in the UK.' MP Steve Webb, social security spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: 'The Government really can't pretend that the winter fuel payments scheme is the answer because these deaths when pensioners were already receiving a winter payment of \u00a3100. It's a question of overall pensioner poverty.' Two years ago, during a mild winter, deaths from cold were just 25,630. But if January is as cold as predicted, the figure could rise to 70,000. ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>At four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon the Daily Express newsroom fell silent as staff gathered around television sets to watch Sky News. The channel was carrying live coverage of the dramatic announcement of the sale of their group's newspapers to soft-porn publisher Richard Desmond. </p> <p>The drama was unfolding on the steps of the Express headquarters, the 'Grey Lubianka', on London's Blackfriars Bridge. But Express staff had no idea the sale was about to be announced, nor that their own reporters would be scooped by Sky. </p> <p>By 4.15pm, the new owner swept on to the forecourt in his powder-blue Bentley, registration RCD1. 'Porn King buys Express ', a nearby newspaper hoarding screamed. </p> <p>These farcical scenes marked the climax of almost two months of horse-trading which has damaged the reputation of United News chief executive Clive Hollick, the New Labour peer, and plunged one of Britain's best-known newspapers into a surreal mix of relief and despair. </p> <p>'People are amused, concerned and shell-shocked,' one senior Express executive said this weekend. 'There's a slight atmosphere of hysteria about the mad things already being done.' On Friday, for example, Express editor Rosie Boycott knew nothing about a change in the paper's masthead in between editions to run a colour plug for OK! , the most successful of Desmond's magazines. Staff were already finding newcomers occupying their desks. And from next week, a deluge of 50 OK! journalists will inject their mix of celebrity and gossip into the Daily and Sunday Express titles and their red-top stablemate, The Star . </p> <p>So far Boycott is biting her lip. With the ink barely dry on the contracts, the Express editor - a pin-up of the liberal establishment - met Desmond for a 'celebratory drink' on Wednesday afternoon. The boss of Northern &amp; Shell, who has brought the nation 38 soft-porn magazines, including Asian Babes and Big Ones and Forty Plus, as well as the celebrity soft-soap rival to Hello!, is, like Boycott, teetotal. He toasted the deal in Coca-Cola; for her it was mineral water. 'I'm just relieved it is all over,' Boycott confided to a colleague. Few staffers, however, expect Boycott, </p> <p>co-founder of feminist magazine Spare Rib, to be there by Christmas. </p> <p>Over the past two years, under Boycott and with advice from Tony Blair's focus group guru Philip Gould, Hollick has transformed the Express ' s editorial line. Instead of challenging the Daily Mail on its own Tory turf, the Express began supporting New Labour. In the run-up to the next general election, the politics of the Express are once again up for grabs. But for now, most of the bile has been reserved for the Labour peer rather than the 'People's Pornographer'. </p> <p>'He's behaved just like a right-wing shit,' one staffer said. 'It's a typically shabby performance,' said another. 'Hollick will go down in history as the first person to sell a national newspaper to a pornographer.' </p> <p>The Northern &amp; Shell boss is aggressive, famously foul-mouthed and does not suffer fools gladly. He left school at 14 and started work as a cloakroom attendant at the Manor House pub in north London. In his early twenties, he set up a music magazine, pre-selling a whole six months' advertising at a Frankfurt music show. </p> <p>Desmond's big break came in 1982 when Northern &amp; Shell gained the UK rights to Bob Guccione's Penthouse magazine. The soft porn stable flourished from there, along with Desmond's colourful reputation for bust-ups, serious minders and hounding enemies until, metaphorically speaking, they dropped. </p> <p>'Richard was on the fund-raising committee of the local synagogue. They'd never heard anyone swear as much as him in front of the rabbi,' one close acquaintance said. 'But because it's Richard, no one takes much notice. You don't ever want to be on the wrong side of him, though.' </p> <p>The Penthouse tie-up was one to dissolve in acrimony a few years back. A failed venture with credit card entrepreneur David Elias - to sell soft porn magazines through petrol stations - wound Desmond up so much that he relentlessly pursued his former partner through the courts. Elias then lost his own business empire to a coup by disgraced Guinness chief Ernest Saunders. </p> <p>Ironically, former Express chairman Lord Stevens was yet another scalp. In 1993, Northern &amp; Shell made a handsome \u00a316m profit flogging Stevens several magazine titles to settle a legal action after the Express ended a distribution contract. Later Desmond was thwarted in trying to buy the Express itself, and the rancour towards Stevens remained. </p> <p>'Richard can be ruthless,' one associate said. 'But he also gives a lot to charity and is a strong family man. At Northern &amp; Shell Towers, which is stuffed full of minders, butlers serve tea in the Richard Desmond room, the Janet Desmond room [named after his wife] and the Robert Desmond room [his son]'. </p> <p>Now he finally has the titles, Desmond has lost little time in making changes. He has ordered staff to increase the print-run of the Daily Express by 200,000 from tomorrow. That is a refreshing change from the frightened Express executives who cut the run so harshly to save cash that many newsagents ran out of papers by midday. </p> <p>But Desmond quickly demonstrated his reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter himself. The Express's \u00a330,000 annual newspaper bill was the first to go. From now on journalists will have to pop to the newsagent to see what rival papers are up to. 'Richard will boost circulation by bringing OK's broad appeal to the Express ,' one adviser said. 'Hollick has not paid full attention to cost-cutting. He's been soft, and Desmond is a hard man on costs.' </p> <p>The hard man, anti-intellectual approach will hardly endear Desmond to his editor. If nothing else, Boycott is a campaigner for high-profile causes. At the Independent on Sunday , she backed the decriminalisation of cannabis. At the Express , she has not been frightened to tell the often elderly and conservative-leaning readership that she believes in abortion on demand, that Britain's attitude to Third World poverty is shameful and that our immigration policies are cruel. </p> <p>Despite his initial charm offensive, Desmond is already understood to be seeking a new editor, more amenable to his line, from a red-top tabloid. </p> <p>His never-say-die drive and ambition have already given others pause for thought. Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, which had hoped to buy the Express , has most to lose. Mail bosses have already held a crisis meeting to discuss competing with Desmond, who also told Express staff in a memo on Thursday that he would 'spend what it takes' to restore the papers to 'their rightful position - number one in their respective markets'. To make matters worse for the Mail , Middle England's market leader, Desmond has identified 'new readers from among 18-34, intelligent independent-minded females' as his target market. 'If that's not our tanks on th e Mai l's lawn, they're blind as bats,' said a Desmond associate. </p> <p>The Mail , however, has a long history of seeing off rivals - and far deeper pockets than Desmond's. </p> <p>The Express , oddly for a company suffering from decades of mismanagement, under-investment and vanishing profits, attracted a scramble of eager buyers now licking their wounds. Besides Associated, they included the secretive Barclay brothers, owners of the Scotsman and Sunday Business ; India's equally secretive Hinduja brothers; Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph ; former Mirror boss David Montgomery; Harrod's chief Mohammed al-Fayed; and fellow porn baron David Sullivan. </p> <p>How did Desmond - a man with no experience of newspapers - put one over some of the shrewdest players in Fleet Street? In the end it was speed and cash that clinched the deal. After months of negotiations with newspaper groups, Hollick and his chairman, Sir Ronnie Hampel, opted for speed and certainty. </p> <p>Desmond first signalled his interest in the Express in a call to Andrew Neil, the former Sunday Times editor masterminding the Barclays' bid. Desmond put forward a simple deal. 'The Barclays want the Daily and Sunday Express . If they buy the two Expresses , what would you say to selling the Star ?' The Barclays liked the idea, but it fell through when Hollick rejected their \u00a375m offer. </p> <p>Four weeks ago, Desmond decided to go for broke and bid \u00a3125m for all three titles and the Express's printing plants. The assets include a valuable 50 per cent share in the Westferry printworks in London's Isle of Dogs which prints the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, the Guardian and The Observer, as well as the Express titles. 'He knew Hollick wanted a quick deal and gave him a quick deal,' one source said. Since Desmond had no newspaper interests, Hollick also knew there was no need for a lengthy Competition Commission inquiry. </p> <p>Desmond, however, is nothing if not sharp. The Telegraph is now considering whether to trigger its pre-emption clause and buy out the Express's 50 per cent of Westferry. If it does, however, the amount the Telegraph will have to pay, plus the value of the Express' northern printing plant, underpins a large part of the \u00a3125m Desmond has shelled out. </p> <p>Insiders reckon, however, that unless he is prepared to invest as much as \u00a340m a year for at least five years he will fail to reverse the Express's historic decline. All three titles in the group are struggling to compete against better-financed rivals. The titles' combined editorial budget is \u00a353m, of which \u00a341m goes to the Express titles - less than half what the Daily Mail spends . Sales of the Mail are more than double those of the Daily Express . </p> <p>So far, however, Desmond's business plan revolves around little more than boosting the Express through a tie-up with OK!. </p> <p>The papers will gain second rights access to the magazine's exclusive photo shoot deals, such as those for the weddings of David and Victoria Beckham and Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. The Star will also benefit from tie-ins with Desmond's top-shelf titles. </p> <p>Desmond has an easily accessible stable of models - still a staple of the paper. </p> <p>Paul Ashford, editorial director of Northern &amp; Shell, says: 'It will be our intention to keep the campaigning parts of the papers, and we want to take the celebrity coverage and give it more impact and greater exclusivity.' </p> <p>Analysts have little doubt that Desmond can turn round the Star and make it a worthier adversary for the Sun . Northern &amp; Shell executives have already praised the Star's success in attracting 'young, high-spending, fast- living males and their female counterparts'. </p> <p>The paper has enjoyed mild success in the past year, stabilising circulation at around 500,000.

      "byline": "John Naughton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anyone who doubts the ingenuity of French judges has never appeared before one. Ask Yahoo! - a poor defenceless little multi-billion dollar company that was taken to court by French groups fighting anti-Semitism because it allows sales of Nazi memorabilia on its US (.com) website (though not on Yahoo.fr). </p> <p>The charge was that the company had violated French laws prohibiting the advertisement, exhibition or sale of any objects likely to incite racial hatred, and that it had offended the 'collective memory' of the country - an allusion to the Holocaust years - by allowing online auctions of Nazi paraphernalia. </p> <p>In the court case last May, Yahoo's lawyers smiled indulgently and patiently explained to Judge Gomez in words of one syllable that the internet was a borderless phenomenon, that the laws of France could not possibly apply to a US company based in California and that in any event it was technically impossible to block French users from accessing the offending websites. </p> <p>The judge, however, was neither intimidated nor impressed by this transatlantic guff. Nor, one suspects, did he take kindly to being patronised. Instead he handed down a verdict against Yahoo, but with a stay of execution until a panel of three established experts in internet technology, headed by Vint Cerf (one of the godfathers of TCP/IP, the protocols that still underpin the net), could advise him on whether it was indeed technically impossible for a US-based site to identify and exclude French surfers. </p> <p>The experts duly deliberated and reported - with a perceptible uneasiness on Vint Cerf's part at least - that a filtering system based on inspecting the ISP addresses of site visitors and keywords used in searches could block 90 per cent of French users. The judge then confirmed his ruling, and gave Yahoo 90 days to comply, telling the company it would be fined $13,000 for every day thereafter that it was in breach of his order. It is not yet clear what Yahoo's response will be, though the company lawyers were making the ritual noises about appealing the verdict to a higher court. </p> <p>There are some delicious ironies here, are there not? To those of us who have endured decades of cultural imperialism, in which American companies claim an apparently God-given right to impose their values on every territory they choose to occupy, US outrage at the French verdict raises, at best, hollow laughter. A society that thinks that the writ of its Digital Millennium Copyright Act should run worldwide is hardly in a position to be affronted by the temerity of a French judge's assertion that French law should prevail over an American company. </p> <p>There was some huffing and puffing about how impotent the French courts would be if Yahoo decided to ignore Gomez's judgment. US legal experts seemed unanimous that Yahoo could not be extradited. (How, one wonders, would you extradite a server farm?) But the Jewish groups that brought the original court actions promised pressure to prosecute Yahoo's owners individually if the company does nothing about the Nazi memorabilia sales on its auction site. </p> <p>Some optimists argued that Yahoo is effectively immune to legal pressure since it has no assets in France. But this falls at the first hurdle - a thriving website named <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.fr\">www.yahoo.fr</a>. And besides, the revelation last week that Yahoo has entered into a partnership with Minitel - France's pioneering but now antiquated online system - to provide email and other services to Minitel users, suggests the company does want to operate in France. So the smart money is on Yahoo swallowing its Californian pride and playing ball with the sainted M\u00d2 Gomez.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who doubts the ingenuity of French judges has never appeared before one. Ask Yahoo! - a poor defenceless little multi-billion dollar company that was taken to court by French groups fighting anti-Semitism because it allows sales of Nazi memorabilia on its US (.com) website (though not on Yahoo.fr). The charge was that the company had violated French laws prohibiting the advertisement, exhibition or sale of any objects likely to incite racial hatred, and that it had offended the 'collective memory' of the country - an allusion to the Holocaust years - by allowing online auctions of Nazi paraphernalia. In the court case last May, Yahoo's lawyers smiled indulgently and patiently explained to Judge Gomez in words of one syllable that the internet was a borderless phenomenon, that the laws of France could not possibly apply to a US company based in California and that in any event it was technically impossible to block French users from accessing the offending websites. The judge, however, was neither intimidated nor impressed by this transatlantic guff. Nor, one suspects, did he take kindly to being patronised. Instead he handed down a verdict against Yahoo, but with a stay of execution until a panel of three established experts in internet technology, headed by Vint Cerf (one of the godfathers of TCP/IP, the protocols that still underpin the net), could advise him on whether it was indeed technically impossible for a US-based site to identify and exclude French surfers. The experts duly deliberated and reported - with a perceptible uneasiness on Vint Cerf's part at least - that a filtering system based on inspecting the ISP addresses of site visitors and keywords used in searches could block 90 per cent of French users. The judge then confirmed his ruling, and gave Yahoo 90 days to comply, telling the company it would be fined $13,000 for every day thereafter that it was in breach of his order. It is not yet clear what Yahoo's response will be, though the company lawyers were making the ritual noises about appealing the verdict to a higher court. There are some delicious ironies here, are there not? To those of us who have endured decades of cultural imperialism, in which American companies claim an apparently God-given right to impose their values on every territory they choose to occupy, US outrage at the French verdict raises, at best, hollow laughter. A society that thinks that the writ of its Digital Millennium Copyright Act should run worldwide is hardly in a position to be affronted by the temerity of a French judge's assertion that French law should prevail over an American company. There was some huffing and puffing about how impotent the French courts would be if Yahoo decided to ignore Gomez's judgment. US legal experts seemed unanimous that Yahoo could not be extradited. (How, one wonders, would you extradite a server farm?) But the Jewish groups that brought the original court actions promised pressure to prosecute Yahoo's owners individually if the company does nothing about the Nazi memorabilia sales on its auction site. Some optimists argued that Yahoo is effectively immune to legal pressure since it has no assets in France. But this falls at the first hurdle - a thriving website named www.yahoo.fr. And besides, the revelation last week that Yahoo has entered into a partnership with Minitel - France's pioneering but now antiquated online system - to provide email and other services to Minitel users, suggests the company does want to operate in France. So the smart money is on Yahoo swallowing its Californian pride and playing ball with the sainted M\u00d2 Gomez. C'est magnifique!

      "body": "<p><strong>Jilly Cooper</strong><br></p> <p> Anyone wanting an introduction to the lunacy, avarice and sexual merry-go-round of the New York contemporary art scene should read <strong> Danny Moynihan's </strong> marvellously funny and accomplished novel, <strong> Boogie Woogie</strong> (Duckworth). Having run galleries, curated and exhibited himself, Moynihan knows everything about bent dealers, pretentious collectors and thrusting young artists. All the characters are so awful that one ends up very fond of the less awful ones. </p> <p><strong>Katherine Whitehorn</strong><br> </p> <p> I usually read paperbacks, so my books of the year are mostly last year's - and the best novel, <strong> The Homemaker </strong>by <strong>Dorothy Canfield Fisher</strong>, was resurrected from 1924 by Persephone Books. This is about a miserably obsessive housewife who is able to take a satisfying job only when her husband is crippled. However, I enjoyed <strong> The Pale Abyssinian </strong> (HarperCollins), <strong> Miles Bredin's </strong> witty biography of James Bruce, the preposterous Scot who discovered the source of the White Nile, and <strong> Yvonne Roberts </strong> 's gripping novel, <strong> A History of Insects</strong> (Headline) about residual snobbery in Pakistan after the Raj. </p> <p><strong>Paul Bailey</strong><br> </p> <p> I found<strong> Victoria Clark's </strong> study of the Orthodox Church in Europe, <strong> Why Angels Fall </strong> (Macmillan), absolutely engrossing. The book provides insights into a Christian religion notably different from either Roman Catholicism or Protestantism. The novel that most impressed me was <strong> Alasdair MacLeod's No Great Mischief </strong> (Cape), a haunting family history set in the wilds of Canada and the Scottish Highlands. <strong> Lorna Sage's </strong> memoir of her nightmarish childhood, <strong> Bad Blood</strong> (Fourth Estate) is funny, moving, and wonderfully written. In <strong> The Million Dollar Mermaid by Esther Williams with Digby Diehl </strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster), the aquatic film star says of her third husband, the relentlessly priapic Fernando Lamas, 'He talked about his penis as if it were a dear and talented friend, with excellent posture.' Thanks to Digby, Esther's autobiography is crammed with similar memorable conceits. </p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Rose</strong><br> </p> <p> Both my books this year come from or return to South Africa. <strong> Gillian Slovo's Red Dust </strong> (Virago) transforms South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with extraordinary skill, into an impossible-to-put-down detective story so that the reader is forced to enter the minds of all sides of the apartheid era, oppressor and victim alike. <strong> Marlene Van Neikerk's </strong> prize-winning Afrikaans novel <strong> Triomf </strong> (Little,Brown) rescues for South African literature the forgotten white trash of the country, while presenting its staggeringly dysfunctional, sometimes inspired, family in such uncompromising terms that Coetzee's Disgrace seems positively redemptive in comparison. </p> <p><strong>David Cannadine</strong><br> </p> <p> Here are three books which should stimulate and divert the mind over the seasonal shutdown.<strong> Michael Howard's The Invention of Peace: Reflections on War and International Order</strong> (Profile) distils a lifetime's learning by our greatest military historian. <strong> John Simpson's A Mad World, My Masters: Tales from a Traveller's Life</strong> (Macmillan) is by turns hilarious and horrifying. And <strong> Simon Schama's A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC) is a bravura performance by the Lord Macaulay of our day. </p> <p><strong>Paul Muldoon</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the best books of poetry of the past year was <strong> Derek Mahon's Selected Poems</strong> (Penguin). Among numerous other distinctions, Mahon is the single most effective manager of the long stanza since Philip Larkin, as is clear from such anthology pieces as 'A Disused Shed in County Wexford' and 'A Garage in County Cork'. </p> <p><strong>Kathy Lette</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Mortimer</strong> is in his anecdotage and his autobiographical <strong> The Summer of a Dormouse </strong> (Viking), a mix of warmth, wit and wisdom is my book of the year. Whether ruminating on Napoleon's dick, the poor bastard who was jailed for sleeping with his own wife while wearing a beard, the Princess and the dipsomaniac Irish undertaker or the Swede caught spanking his wife with a live eel (and fined for cruelty to animals), the mischievous Mortimer weaves comedy and compassion into his prose. </p> <p><strong>Simon Callow</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Tom Phillips's </strong> millennium project, <strong> The Postcard Century</strong> (Thames &amp; Hudson) is an inexhaustibly fascinating account of private lives and public images over the past 100 years, as intimate and authentic an account of the experience of being alive at that time as we shall ever have. <strong> Thomas Wright's Oscar Wilde: Table Talk</strong> (Cassell) suggests more than anything else in print what it was like to hear the great man do what he did better than anyone: talk. </p> <p><strong>John Mortimer</strong><br> </p> <p> A plot which involves two alleged Lord Lucans and a lady psychiatrist who faked the stigmata could only have gestated in the fertile brain of <strong> Muriel Spark</strong>.<strong> Aiding and Abetting</strong> (Viking) is written with the meticulous sparkle which makes her prose the envy of contemporary writers. We live at a time when we seem to be determined to cut ourselves off from our history, a fatal tendency that might be cured by <strong> Simon Schama's </strong> excitingly readable <strong> A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC), full of kings and battles, puts an end to the fashionable idea that history should only be studied in the lives of medieval bakers or eighteenth-century piano tuners. Finally, the English obsession with verdant and manicured lawns is entertainingly weeded and watered in <strong> Tom Fort's The Grass is Greener: Our Love Affair with the Lawn</strong> (HarperCollins). It contains one of the best descriptions of a potting shed ever written. </p> <p><strong>Adam Mars-Jones</strong><br> </p> <p> The novel and the book of stories I most enjoyed this year are both products of creative Indian summers: <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) and <strong> Penelope Fitzgerald's The Means of Escape</strong> (Flamingo). Roth's novel addresses with subtlety the issues of sex, race, identity. Fitzgerald, whose death this year ends a brilliant literary career that began when she was 60, constantly brushes up against profundity without ever seeming to have designs on it. A striking debut collection of stories was <strong> Never Trust A Rabbit </strong> by<strong> Jeremy Dyson</strong> (Duckworth). His stories nestle in the little vacant chink between Roald Dahl and Borges. <strong> Jeremy Seabrook's Love in a Different Climate: Men Who Have Sex with Men in India</strong> (Verso) is illuminating - an attempt to describe taboo experience without imposing Western assumptions. </p> <p><strong>Stephen Bayley</strong><br> </p> <p> I checked and I haven't actually read anything in the Amazon Hot 100. Not even The Thunderbirds Colouring Book, or David Beckham: My World. It's been a thin year for good books. Certainly, no fiction that sticks. I devoured <strong> Michael Lewis's The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story </strong> (Coronet), a pacy romp around the idiot-savant computer geek Jim Clark, but it's really just a long article, like so many US business books. Two late 1999 publications that have real value are <strong> James Campbell's This is the Beat Generation</strong> (Secker &amp; Warburg) , an excellent popular history of Kerouac, Ginsberg and their dissolute company, and the re-issue by Books &amp; Co/Helen Marx Books of <strong> Iris Origo's </strong> gloriously elegant 1953 life: <strong> Leopardi - A Study in Solitude</strong>. This last has a new introduction by <strong> Shirley Hazzard</strong> whose miniature <strong> Greene on Capri</strong> (Virago) was a small pleasure, full of fine observation and detail. But best of all has been <strong> City Secrets: Rome</strong> (The Little Bookroom) edited by <strong> Robert Kahn</strong>. This is a straightforward compilation of art, architecture and restaurant tips by people who really know the city: it's cruelly tempting, insightful and inspiring, as well as being nicely designed. The ordinary thing done extraordinary well: I'd never lend my copy, it's always in use. </p> <p><strong>Melvyn Bragg</strong><br></p> <p> The latest collection of <strong> Alan Jenkins's </strong> poems,<strong> The Drift</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus), is stunningly good. Full of passionate regret, clear, erudite, both a chronicle of the poet's time and a comment on it in poems as fine as any being written today. It is some sort of minor miracle that <strong> Michael Donaghy's </strong> masterly collection comes out in the same year as Jenkins. <strong> Conjure </strong> (Picador) contains poems which are as deeply structured, as lucid, moving and witty as Auden at his best. He brings powerful forces to bear on the memory of deep attachments and his vivid story-telling sense is a marvel. <strong> Adam Phillips's Promises, Promises: Essays on Psychoanalysis and Literature</strong> (Faber) is a brilliant collection of essays around the subjects in which disciplines Phillips excels. </p> <p> <strong>Rowan Pelling</strong><br></p> <p> I have just started the book which I have waited patiently for all year - <strong>Philip Pullman's</strong> finale to his 'Dark Materials' trilogy,<strong> The Amber Spyglass</strong>. After only 20 pages I find myself spellbound by Pullman's storytelling. All my godchildren will receive the complete hardback set for Christmas.</p> <p> <strong>Ian Hislop</strong><br></p> <p> Having been a judge in the recent Blue Peter Book Awards, I have read a lot more children's fiction this year than anything aimed at adults. This probably explains why most of the books have seemed so well-written and entertaining. Can I recommend <strong>The Shadow of the Minotaur by Alan Gibbons</strong> (Dolphin Paperback) and <strong>Pilgrim's Progress by Geraldine McCaughrean</strong> (Hodder)? You should probably find a child to give them to, but you could do a lot worse than read them yourself first.</p> <p> <strong>Philip Hensher</strong><br></p> <p> The novels I liked best this year were<strong> Jane Smiley's</strong> grand, detailed <strong>Horse Heaven</strong> (Faber), one of those books which seems interested in absolutely everything, and <strong>Patrick McGrath's Martha Peake</strong> (Viking). He is a one-off; someone who has infused the tawdry old genre of the Gothic novel with a showy, enchanting intelligence. I simply could not put down <strong>John Drummond's</strong> entertainingly poisonous memoirs, <strong>Tainted By Experience</strong> (Faber). <strong>Graham Robb's life of Rimbaud</strong> (Picador) was unfailingly good; a calm, sceptical eye turned on a turbulent life. <strong>Helen Simpson's</strong> collection <strong>Hey Yeah Right Get A Life</strong> (Cape) was simply brilliant. Individual stories gave only a suggestion of the cumulative, terrifying force of the whole book. She has always been funny; with this, she displays herself a writer of unusual power. </p>",

He's been nominated for both an Oscar and the Nobel Prize, and won countless other awards. The world's best selling science-fiction writer now has just one more ambition left. And he only has to wait a few more weeks till he achieves it. </p> <p>Sir Arthur Charles Clarke has long nurtured the aspiration to see in the year that made him a household name: 2001. 'I want to exercise to keep my strength up so I can make it through the year 2001 - this is my real aspiration now,' he said in 1995. In three weeks he turns 83, and two weeks after that the world turns 2001. </p> <p>He has good reason to want to see the year in. Confined to a wheelchair by post-polio syndrome, and having difficulty travelling from his technopolis compound in Sri Lanka, 2001 won't be a space odyssey for him, more an odyssey of the ego. For a man who impresses on his visitors his boundless but remarkably inoffensive love of adulation, next year will be almost an ante-chamber to heaven. Celebrations of the film and book 2001: A Space Odyssey, are set to explode across the planet. </p> <p>The extravaganza is kicking off with a concert by Jean Michel Jarre on 31 December, followed by features in magazines from Forbes to Playboy, as well as video lectures, dedications and more awards.

He's been nominated for both an Oscar and the Nobel Prize, and won countless other awards. The world's best selling science-fiction writer now has just one more ambition left. And he only has to wait a few more weeks till he achieves it. Sir Arthur Charles Clarke has long nurtured the aspiration to see in the year that made him a household name: 2001. 'I want to exercise to keep my strength up so I can make it through the year 2001 - this is my real aspiration now,' he said in 1995. In three weeks he turns 83, and two weeks after that the world turns 2001. He has good reason to want to see the year in. Confined to a wheelchair by post-polio syndrome, and having difficulty travelling from his technopolis compound in Sri Lanka, 2001 won't be a space odyssey for him, more an odyssey of the ego. For a man who impresses on his visitors his boundless but remarkably inoffensive love of adulation, next year will be almost an ante-chamber to heaven. Celebrations of the film and book 2001: A Space Odyssey, are set to explode across the planet. The extravaganza is kicking off with a concert by Jean Michel Jarre on 31 December, followed by features in magazines from Forbes to Playboy, as well as video lectures, dedications and more awards. The Smithsonian Institute in Washington is holding a viewing of the film, while Warner are launching films of several others of his books.

Harvesting is a tough job wherever you do it, but in Tokaj, isolated on Hungary's north-eastern border with Slovakia, it's doubly so.

Without asz\u00fa, Tokaj would make drinkable but essentially forgettable dry whites from Furmint and H\u00e1rslevel\u00fc grapes. With them, it is arguably the greatest sweet-wine area in the world. The problem for Tokaj is that great asz\u00fa years are rarer than victories by the England football squad. In the last decade, only 1993, 1999 and 2000 would qualify. The rest of the time, the region is stuck with a product (its dry wines) that are hard to sell. No wonder so many growers are selling or abandoning their vineyards. </p> <p>Tokaj has a distinguished heritage stretching back to the 13th century. Over the years, this pretty, gently sloping region has seduced everyone from Schubert to Catherine the Great. And yet just a decade ago, the place was heading for the historical slagheap. Forty years of Communist rule turned Tokaj into an also-ran. A few good wines were produced, but the state monopoly betrayed the region's inheritance with cold insouciance. Most of Tokaj's wines ended up in the Soviet Union, exchanged for oil. In some cases, it was hard to tell which was the more drinkable. </p> <p>Things picked up in the early 1990s, when a new government decided to sell off some of the region's best vineyards to foreign investors from England, France, Spain, Italy, Japan and the United States. The outsiders were resented in Tokaj, but they have begun to resurrect its reputation. Companies such as Diszn\u00f3k\u00f6, Oremus, Chteau Pajzos and H\u00e9tsz\u00f6l\u00f6 have brought new ideas and techniques to the area, replanting great vineyard sites and building new cellars. </p> <p>In the process, they are changing the style of Tokaj's sweet wines, making them fresher, racier and less oxidised, often with an oaky undertone. To traditionalists, this is a sacrilege; to the modernisers it is essential progress.

Soaked through and scratched pink from playing in the garden, I am in need of food with a backbone. (The 80 wallflowers are now planted, but I am unsure if I will ever again stand up straight.) Typical autumn roasts of neat but diminutive birds don't warm your marrow after digging a trench and 'heeling in' a dozen bushes in the rain. Only meat with a hearty slop of onions and wine will do that. </p> <p>A summer that never got going and an autumn that turned instantly to slime have brought an urgency to sniffing out recipes to comfort and nourish. Never before has my cooking been so butch, so early. As I said, food with a backbone, and by that I don't mean a neck of lamb or clod of beef, but a backbone of aromatics. It is the sweet onions, knobbly roots and tough herbs that provide the flavour base - the skeleton, if you like - with the body coming from the meat and cooking liquor. </p> <p>The knee-jerk reaction is to chop up a hotch-potch of carrot, onion and celery, and to ask the butcher for a bit of stewing beef, but I think it can be more interesting than that. Game birds - light meat, high flavours and some bones to impart goodness - seem more appropriate while there are a few golden leaves left clinging to the trees. </p> <p>We add carrots to a casserole for the sweetness they impart. But there is no reason why we cannot use parsnips or swedes instead - both have enough sugar to caramelise at the edges as we sweat them in fat at the start of cooking. What a cold, wet family is looking for is a deep-seated, earthy sweetness that can only come from roots. </p> <p>If cold-weather food is to be satisfying, it needs that earthy note. Without thinking, I would reach for the celery, for its faintly bitter, mineral notes, but there is no reason why celeriac, the celery's root, couldn't be given an outing. Better that than letting the creamy globe wither in the vegetable rack, its fate in my kitchen more often than I would care to admit. What about chard? This up-and-coming vegetable has an earthiness even stalwart celery cannot approach. </p> <p>Little things matter even in the murky depths of a casserole. Bay leaves, even one or two, contribute more than you expect as you blow the dust off them. Twigs of thyme look unprepossessing as they hang from the ceiling, but a slow stewing will tease out their goodness. That doesn't mean we should chuck stuff at the pot willy nilly. Each addition should be thought out. A few blue-black juniper berries with a pigeon, or some woodsy mushrooms with a pheasant. </p> <p>Rowley Leigh of Kensington Place in London's Notting Hill adds chocolate to his game casserole. It makes sense - he calls its effect dry, smoky and slightly bitter, which seems perfect for warming the soul. He served it at the launch party for his new book No Place Like Home (\u00a325, Fourth Estate), atop a mound of rib-sticking white polenta. (Just as well he did, too, bravely throwing his bash in a marquee on a rainy night in Shepherd's Bush.) His book, quietly perfect in every way, is currently bringing great joy to my kitchen, with its understated and thoughtful recipes, its handsome illustrations made even stronger by a free-thinking and original design. </p> <p>The syrupy sensuousness of the gravy can only really work if you involve a bone or two. The texture of the sauce will depend somewhat on how much collagen is present in the carcass. In the case of game birds, this is not a lot, but you will still get a more interesting result than if you miss them out altogether. Purists will no doubt throw one of their little tiffs but I see no reason why you cannot tuck a few chicken wings into the pot with the game to add their sticky glue and give the whole thing more body. </p> <p>Whether you fine-tune your casserole with chocolate, redcurrant jelly, juniper or coriander, the point here is the chemistry that results from cooking roots, alliums, herbs and meat together at a low setting. A recipe that slowly, surely warms us from the feet up. Which reminds me: somewhere, out there in the mud, is my left shoe. </p> <p> <strong> A simple game casserole</strong> </p> <p>Some mashed parsnip, celeriac and potato, or swede is quite wonderful with this. Serves 4. </p> <p>Cut a couple of pheasants into four and brown them nicely on all sides in a little groundnut oil in a casserole. Lift them out and, adding more oil if needs be, brown two large chopped onions, a few carrots and stalk or two of celery. You want the vegetables to be tender and lightly browned here and there. Add about 300g mushrooms cut into chunks, let them brown in the pan, then sprinkle over a scant tablespoon or so of flour, stirring it as it colours and binds the vegetables together. </p> <p>Return the pheasant to the pan, pour over a bottle of red wine - I suggest a Rioja or some other such rich red - and bring slowly to the boil. Turn down the heat immediately, add a bunch of thyme and a couple of bay leaves, a strip of orange peel or whatever else seems appropriate, then cover with a lid and put in the oven at 180 C/gas mark 5 till the meat is tender (about an hour). Check for seasoning - it will need salt, black pepper and maybe a little redcurrant jelly - then serve with the mashed roots. </p> <p><strong> Rowley Leigh's venison stew with chestnuts and chocolate</strong> </p> <p>A truly warming casserole for a dozen people.

For the marinade, peel the carrots and onions and cut them, with the celery, into 1cm cubes. Separate the garlic cloves (do not peel), seed and coarsely slice the chilli and put all the ingredients into a large bowl with the meat, finishing with a film of the oil. Cover and marinate overnight in the fridge. </p> <p>The next day, pour the marinade into a colander placed over a bowl. Lift out the meat and dry it on kitchen paper. Season with sea salt and then brown it in the olive oil in a frying pan, in batches, transferring it to a large, ovenproof casserole as each batch is done. When all the meat has been well browned, fry the vegetables from the marinade in the same pan. When they are nicely coloured, sprinkle over the flour and cook for a minute or two until it also lightly browned. Pour over the liquid from the marinade and scrape up the residue from the base of the pan with a wooden spoon. As soon as the marinade comes to the boil, pour it over the meat in the casserole. Add a little water if the meat is not covered, put it on the stove and bring back to the boil, skimming well to remove any grease that surfaces.

Strain the liquid through a fine sieve back over the meat, squeezing through every drop of juice but discarding the vegetables. Add the onions and chestnuts to the stew. Bring it very gently back to a simmer and cook equally gently for five minutes so the flavours meld. Finely grate the chocolate and whisk in, a teaspoon at a time, so it melts into the stew. Proceed cautiously, tasting, adding a little chocolate, a knob of the remaining butter, a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Do not let the chocolate boil. The minute you think you can taste the chocolate, stop immediately and correct with a little more lemon juice.

      "body": "<p>I normally write these pages in a set order. First the main piece - you would be amazed at how long that takes me. Lots of research, pencil sucking and displacement activity. Then I do whatever is in the Your Roots section as a piece of social duty and, lastly, with the friskiness of a lamb on a trampoline, I romp home with My Roots. </p> <p>But this week the lines have got blurred. Prompted by guilt at not having finished this piece by Friday night and by the first clear day for weeks and weeks, yesterday I planted our garlic. I was, by chance, doing it on the 11th hour of the 11th day of this month and stood quietly for a couple of minutes, fist full of garlic and mud, thinking about Edward Thomas and the chalk that runs undersea from Steep to the battlefields of northern France. No chalk here. I had dug over the ground a couple of days before, lifting Florence fennel (mostly bolted) and sweetcorn (astonishing crop), the roots doing an amazingly effective job of sucking up moisture and keeping the otherwise sodden ground dry enough to work. </p> <p>Sharp sand had been added to one of the squares a couple of years ago to encourage better carrots out of the heavy soil, and a huge amount of cattle manure added to the other. The sanded soil was still noticeably lighter and free-draining, while the manured plot - which was made horribly sticky for a full year after manuring, had developed a crumbly, suety texture. I added mushroom compost to both, rotovated and raked them over. Then it rained all night. </p> <p>Normally, I would have left it to dry out, but because of this article and sunshine the garlic went in nevertheless. Some people recommend dibbing a hole for each clove, but I find that too laborious. Instead, I push them in as far as my fingers will reach into the sticky earth. Nowadays, however dry the ground, I always work off a length of scaffolding plank cut to the size of the bed and use it both to stand on, so as to avoid compacting the carefully prepared soil, and as a marker for planting. </p> <p>As for the spacing between individual cloves, I always go by eye, working out at about 8in per plant. For the first time ever, I used last summer's crop for seed, selecting bulbs as fat as possible and sitting in the November sunshine breaking them open, big cloves in one basket, small ones in another. As a rule, the bigger the seed clove the bigger the garlic bulb it will produce. I use only the Spanish Moraluz, which grows well for us and, perhaps more importantly, seems to keep very well. At the end, I was left with two bare pieces of ground dotted with rows of tiny holes. But it was good magic for an hour or two. </p> <p>Garlic has always had a powerful magic. Ancient everybody, from Egyptians to first-century Hindu doctors used it to keep their insides clean, cure heart disease and ward off terrors in the night. I have grown huge amounts of it over the past few years. Actually, the scale of this year's harvest was a mistake. When we ordered our seed garlic last October, somehow our estimate of the cloves we needed got translated into an order for the same quantity of bulbs. I had been generous, anyway, so the seed delivery arrived like the weekly supplies to a Mediterranean supermarket. But it is an ill wind and I had just read in Eliot Coleman's wonderful The New Organic Grower (\u00a319.95, Chelsea Green Publishing) that he uses garlic as a cleansing crop that improves the subsequent quality of brassicas grown in the same ground. I had just cleared two long beds of pumpkins and squashes, so I filled both of them with garlic. I got them in at the end of November, their names reading like the race card for the 3.30 at Sandown; Cledar, Moraluz, Printnor and Sultop. </p> <p>The reason for sowing garlic in autumn is to let the roots develop before the cold weather sets in. Once the roots have established, and the tops have appeared like green wisps of flame above the ground, they need a month with the temperature below 10 C, otherwise they tend to develop into one small bulb without dividing into cloves. Sometimes this happens erratically within the same crop. The best thing is to keep the 'rounds', as they are called, and use them as seed for next year. As with all onions, they need to be kept weed free and watered while growing, and they like well-drained but moderately rich ground - so I always add mushroom compost just before planting. If any of the plants develop seed-heads, simply cut them off as they appear. </p> <p>Garlic needs to be harvested as soon as it is ready, otherwise the bulbs start to shrivel and their storing capacity reduces. Leave them in the ground until the leaves have yellowed, then dig them up, preferably on a clear, sunny day so that they can be left on the ground to dry. Failing that, bring them in to a dry, well-ventilated place and let them dry for a few weeks, leaves and all. This is when their storage capacity is established. Not all garlic, however, is able to store for long. Any trace of dampness will almost inevitably induce rotting and fungal trouble. We always cut the leaves off ours when they are dried. </p> <p>Fresh garlic straight from the ground is wonderful, with its sheath of leaf covering the whole bulb and the cloves as shiny and white as an unripe conker. We start lifting it from the end of May when it is mild enough to eat raw. I saw the rerun of Alan Bennett's wonderful play An Englishman Abroad the other day and particularly enjoyed the scene where the Burgess character served a lunch of a raw tomato and proceeded to wedge cloves of garlic into each quarter, which he then ate with gusto. I remember reading somewhere that Burgess used to munch raw garlic - which should have immediately told his masters that beneath that Etonian breast beat the treacherous heart of Johnny Foreigner. I rather like raw garlic, too, and were it not for the tiny relics of a social life that I do have, I'd munch it the more. I don't mind the smell in other people, any more than I mind someone smelling of bonfires or box bushes. But I know that for some people garlic never just smells, it stinks. </p> <p>I don't remember garlic being grown in the garden of my childhood, although we grew all the other edible members of the allium family: onions, shallotts, leeks and chives. My mother and most of her pre-Elizabeth David generation would have viewed a garlic bulb with about the same degree of suspicion as a vampire out on the midnight razzle, it being the archetypal symbol of suspect food, low morals and over-sexed continentals. And if that isn't proof positive that you should plant some, then you are on the side of the vampires.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>I've done garlic already, so that has cut my news down by half. While it has surprised me how relatively unsodden the cultivated ground has been, the grass paths are a joke. Just walking around has compacted them sufficiently to reduce drainage to the speed of flowing bitumen. Now we don't just need wellies to walk to the end of the garden but special trousers, too. </p> <p>We extended the land drains by digging another overflow soakaway because the existing land drain soakaway has given up soaking. This meant another very handsome trench and hole. I seriously find holes in the ground exciting and beautiful.</p> <p>Outside the propagating greenhouse we have masses of plants in pots standing out through unplanted herbaceous plants, and dozens of lilies in terracotta pots. The other morning I thought it was time to rescue them from the pool of water that they have been sitting in for the past month and I moved the lot, cleared out the cold frames, cleaned everything up and put what would fit in the frames and raised the rest out of the flood.</p> <p>We have dozens of plants in square 9cm pots and they were all in moulded plastic trays. Very handy, too. But when I lifted them up I found snails clustered in the interstices like bunches of grapes. Hundreds of the things. So the trays have been abandoned and everything has to be moved singly, which is a pain but highlights that one of the best ways of dealing with snails is to deny them dark, dry hiding places.</p> <p>I went to the Organic Food awards lunch the other week and heard a disturbing story from a fellow guest. She had been taken on a tour of Wisley and was shocked to see that only a tiny section of the vegetable garden was organic, although the staff selling plants told her that most customers assumed all the plants for sale were grown organically.</p> <p>When she raised the lack of interest in organics with her RHS hosts they responded blankly, unable to comprehend the issue. I know that at Chelsea, organic growers have been openly discriminated against in the past. It amazes me that the best-known garden body in this country is so out of touch and out of sympathy with the general gardening trend and interest towards organic gardening, and it is time that they crept into the 21st century and championed holistic, organic horticulture.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: How to grow your own garlic</strong></p> <p>It is getting quite late to order garlic, but here are some places you could try: </p> <p>\u0095 Simpson's Seeds, 27 Meadowbrook, Old Oxted, Surrey RH8 9LT (tel/fax 01883 715 242).</p> <p>\u0095 The Organic Gardening Catalogue, Riverdene Business Park, Moseley Road, Hersham, Surrey KT12 4RG (01932 253 666, fax 01932 252 707, www.organiccatalog.com).</p> <p>\u0095 Edwin Tucker &amp; Sons, Brewery Meadow, Stonepark, Ashburton, Newton Abbot, Devon TQ13 7DG (01364 652 403, fax 01364 654 300).</p> <p>As a workable last resort you can buy a healthy bulb from a greengrocer or supermarket and use the biggest cloves from that for seed.</p> <p>Garlic can be easily grown in containers. Add plenty of drainage material to potting compost and put in a sunny place. A weekly feed with dilute seedweed from March onwards would not do any harm.</p> <p>Garlic is said to be greatly beneficial to tomato plants if they are grown together. It also has a reputation for keeping greenfly away from roses if a clove is planted by each shrub.</p>",

Sharp sand had been added to one of the squares a couple of years ago to encourage better carrots out of the heavy soil, and a huge amount of cattle manure added to the other. The sanded soil was still noticeably lighter and free-draining, while the manured plot - which was made horribly sticky for a full year after manuring, had developed a crumbly, suety texture. I added mushroom compost to both, rotovated and raked them over. Then it rained all night. Normally, I would have left it to dry out, but because of this article and sunshine the garlic went in nevertheless. Some people recommend dibbing a hole for each clove, but I find that too laborious. Instead, I push them in as far as my fingers will reach into the sticky earth. Nowadays, however dry the ground, I always work off a length of scaffolding plank cut to the size of the bed and use it both to stand on, so as to avoid compacting the carefully prepared soil, and as a marker for planting. As for the spacing between individual cloves, I always go by eye, working out at about 8in per plant. For the first time ever, I used last summer's crop for seed, selecting bulbs as fat as possible and sitting in the November sunshine breaking them open, big cloves in one basket, small ones in another. As a rule, the bigger the seed clove the bigger the garlic bulb it will produce. I use only the Spanish Moraluz, which grows well for us and, perhaps more importantly, seems to keep very well. At the end, I was left with two bare pieces of ground dotted with rows of tiny holes. But it was good magic for an hour or two. Garlic has always had a powerful magic. Ancient everybody, from Egyptians to first-century Hindu doctors used it to keep their insides clean, cure heart disease and ward off terrors in the night. I have grown huge amounts of it over the past few years. Actually, the scale of this year's harvest was a mistake. When we ordered our seed garlic last October, somehow our estimate of the cloves we needed got translated into an order for the same quantity of bulbs. I had been generous, anyway, so the seed delivery arrived like the weekly supplies to a Mediterranean supermarket. But it is an ill wind and I had just read in Eliot Coleman's wonderful The New Organic Grower (\u00a319.95, Chelsea Green Publishing) that he uses garlic as a cleansing crop that improves the subsequent quality of brassicas grown in the same ground. I had just cleared two long beds of pumpkins and squashes, so I filled both of them with garlic. I got them in at the end of November, their names reading like the race card for the 3.30 at Sandown; Cledar, Moraluz, Printnor and Sultop. The reason for sowing garlic in autumn is to let the roots develop before the cold weather sets in. Once the roots have established, and the tops have appeared like green wisps of flame above the ground, they need a month with the temperature below 10 C, otherwise they tend to develop into one small bulb without dividing into cloves. Sometimes this happens erratically within the same crop. The best thing is to keep the 'rounds', as they are called, and use them as seed for next year. As with all onions, they need to be kept weed free and watered while growing, and they like well-drained but moderately rich ground - so I always add mushroom compost just before planting. If any of the plants develop seed-heads, simply cut them off as they appear. Garlic needs to be harvested as soon as it is ready, otherwise the bulbs start to shrivel and their storing capacity reduces. Leave them in the ground until the leaves have yellowed, then dig them up, preferably on a clear, sunny day so that they can be left on the ground to dry. Failing that, bring them in to a dry, well-ventilated place and let them dry for a few weeks, leaves and all. This is when their storage capacity is established. Not all garlic, however, is able to store for long. Any trace of dampness will almost inevitably induce rotting and fungal trouble. We always cut the leaves off ours when they are dried. Fresh garlic straight from the ground is wonderful, with its sheath of leaf covering the whole bulb and the cloves as shiny and white as an unripe conker. We start lifting it from the end of May when it is mild enough to eat raw. I saw the rerun of Alan Bennett's wonderful play An Englishman Abroad the other day and particularly enjoyed the scene where the Burgess character served a lunch of a raw tomato and proceeded to wedge cloves of garlic into each quarter, which he then ate with gusto. I remember reading somewhere that Burgess used to munch raw garlic - which should have immediately told his masters that beneath that Etonian breast beat the treacherous heart of Johnny Foreigner. I rather like raw garlic, too, and were it not for the tiny relics of a social life that I do have, I'd munch it the more. I don't mind the smell in other people, any more than I mind someone smelling of bonfires or box bushes. But I know that for some people garlic never just smells, it stinks. I don't remember garlic being grown in the garden of my childhood, although we grew all the other edible members of the allium family: onions, shallotts, leeks and chives. My mother and most of her pre-Elizabeth David generation would have viewed a garlic bulb with about the same degree of suspicion as a vampire out on the midnight razzle, it being the archetypal symbol of suspect food, low morals and over-sexed continentals. And if that isn't proof positive that you should plant some, then you are on the side of the vampires. My roots: A week in Monty's garden I've done garlic already, so that has cut my news down by half. While it has surprised me how relatively unsodden the cultivated ground has been, the grass paths are a joke. Just walking around has compacted them sufficiently to reduce drainage to the speed of flowing bitumen. Now we don't just need wellies to walk to the end of the garden but special trousers, too. We extended the land drains by digging another overflow soakaway because the existing land drain soakaway has given up soaking. This meant another very handsome trench and hole. I seriously find holes in the ground exciting and beautiful. Outside the propagating greenhouse we have masses of plants in pots standing out through unplanted herbaceous plants, and dozens of lilies in terracotta pots. The other morning I thought it was time to rescue them from the pool of water that they have been sitting in for the past month and I moved the lot, cleared out the cold frames, cleaned everything up and put what would fit in the frames and raised the rest out of the flood. We have dozens of plants in square 9cm pots and they were all in moulded plastic trays. Very handy, too. But when I lifted them up I found snails clustered in the interstices like bunches of grapes. Hundreds of the things. So the trays have been abandoned and everything has to be moved singly, which is a pain but highlights that one of the best ways of dealing with snails is to deny them dark, dry hiding places. I went to the Organic Food awards lunch the other week and heard a disturbing story from a fellow guest. She had been taken on a tour of Wisley and was shocked to see that only a tiny section of the vegetable garden was organic, although the staff selling plants told her that most customers assumed all the plants for sale were grown organically. When she raised the lack of interest in organics with her RHS hosts they responded blankly, unable to comprehend the issue. I know that at Chelsea, organic growers have been openly discriminated against in the past. It amazes me that the best-known garden body in this country is so out of touch and out of sympathy with the general gardening trend and interest towards organic gardening, and it is time that they crept into the 21st century and championed holistic, organic horticulture. Your roots: How to grow your own garlic It is getting quite late to order garlic, but here are some places you could try: \u0095 Simpson's Seeds, 27 Meadowbrook, Old Oxted, Surrey RH8 9LT (tel/fax 01883 715 242). \u0095 The Organic Gardening Catalogue, Riverdene Business Park, Moseley Road, Hersham, Surrey KT12 4RG (01932 253 666, fax 01932 252 707, www.organiccatalog.com). \u0095 Edwin Tucker &amp; Sons, Brewery Meadow, Stonepark, Ashburton, Newton Abbot, Devon TQ13 7DG (01364 652 403, fax 01364 654 300). As a workable last resort you can buy a healthy bulb from a greengrocer or supermarket and use the biggest cloves from that for seed. Garlic can be easily grown in containers. Add plenty of drainage material to potting compost and put in a sunny place. A weekly feed with dilute seedweed from March onwards would not do any harm. Garlic is said to be greatly beneficial to tomato plants if they are grown together. It also has a reputation for keeping greenfly away from roses if a clove is planted by each shrub.",

      "body": "<p>Christmas is coming. The lights are up, the shops are crowded, and my five-year-old son is sitting in front of the television repeating a mantra every 30 seconds during the commercial breaks (with pauses only for Barbie ads): 'I want that. I want that. I want that.' Working out what he really wants in the middle of this deluge of advertising is hard enough; but then, if what he's chosen turns out to be this year's favourite, the problem is getting it. Last-minute toy shortages have become such a feature of the festive season that there's even been a Christmas-shopping action movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger's dismal 1996 flop Jingle All The Way , in which he plays a dad battling through the malls on Christmas Eve for that season's must-have toy, a Turboman doll. </p> <p>To prove the clich\u00e9 that it seems to come earlier each year, this time round the Christmas queues started on Thursday 7 September, when shops gave out pre-order forms for Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation 2 computer games console. Forms were strictly rationed, and some shops in London opened at midnight to satisfy demand. By the following Monday, there were none left in most parts of the country, and although the console was released here just two days ago, only customers who ordered in September will be able to collect their hardware in time for Christmas. </p> <p>The delays in manufacturing are due to shortages of various electronic components, not helped the massive success of the console in Japan, where more than 3.52m have been sold since its launch last spring. As a result, Britain will be getting fewer than 200,000 consoles before Christmas, and only 500,000 went on sale in the US on 26 October - half the number originally planned. By early November, the online auction site E-bay was selling consoles at $500 to $600 - double the $299 retail price, and rising. </p> <p>Was it always like this? Every parent fears their child being disappointed on the big day, but I have no recollection of ever opening my presents and feeling let down. But then, my desires were always quite generic: a bike, a bat, a Sindy doll, roller skates. Specific brands or designs rarely seemed important. </p> <p>As for computer games, I remember the Christmas when my brother and I eagerly unwrapped a piece of plastic the size of a small suitcase and connected it to our TV. A mono picture came up, with two short white lines on either side. By manoeuvring the hefty controls, you could move the lines up and down and hit a square 'ball' in the clumsiest tennis game ever seen. Not that this bothered us. We played for hours. This was the cutting edge of leisure technology, an episode of Star Trek come to life in our very own living room. We had seen the future. And its name was Pong.</p> <p>But the 70s were a more innocent time, and not just in terms of the technology available. Children's shows were only on television for a couple of hours a day, and the art of saturation advertising to the young had yet to be perfected. It wasn't until the success of Star Wars in 1977 that film became wedded irrevocably to merchandising, while the deregulation of TV in the early 80s led to shows such as He-Man and Masters of the Universe actually made by toy companies to sell product. From Ninja Turtles to Power Rangers, Batman to Buzz Lightyear, many of the year's Christmas successes since have been tied to films and TV shows. </p> <p>But toy manufacturers also face more competition than ever. As well as toys, your average eight-year-old may well be asking for a replica football kit or expensive trainers, a Spice Girls or Westlife CD, computer games and hardware - Toys 'R' Us even stocks mobile phones now. And no matter how sophisticated the marketing, children constantly surprise - take the yo-yo craze of 1998, in which 30m of them were sold in the UK alone without any aggressive marketing. </p> <p>Many toy manufacturers have gone bankrupt due to the failure of one toy, and even successful products can disappoint. Having sold 3m Star Wars books to tie in with the new film, children's publisher Dorling Kindersley ordered a print run of 9m more to cope with a Christmas rush that never materialised, and were destroyed. The giant toy corporation Hasbro also announced lower than expected profits after their Star Wars lines failed to perform as expected. </p> <p>At the moment, says Allen of the toy giant Mattel, her company is talking to the big retailers about Christmas. Christmas 2001, that is. By February, nearly all the big manufacturers will have shown their new lines at the annual toy fairs, and will be forecasting how many of each to make. </p> <p>But it's an inexact science. 'With perennial favourites like Barbie and Action Man, you can tell year on year more or less where they will sit in the market. What you can't predict is what the competition is going to do to you. And then you've got crazes like Pok\u00e9mon cards or yo-yos that suddenly appear. Throughout the year, the retailers could change their forecasts, other things could come on the market. Which is why you'll suddenly see an awful lot of toys discounted because somebody got their forecasting wrong and produced too much, and you'll get things that have been a big success that are in short supply.' </p> <p>This year's shortage looks set to be a familiar one. Taken by surprise by the success of the BBC's revival of its 60s children's series Thunderbirds , in 1992 shops quickly ran out of the model of Tracy Island, the Thunderbirds HQ. Although the show was again revived by the BBC this autumn, no one expected it to have the same impact the third time around. So Thunderbirds are no once more. The company behind Tracy Island, Vivid Imaginations, says that it is too big and heavy to bring over from factories in Far East by air, but extra supplies will be shipped in before Christmas. And Hamleys is expecting a limited stock of it to arrive in store in December, though it admits that it probably won't satisfy demand. </p> <p>At Mattel, Sarah Allen says there's only so much that can be done at this point. 'Usually, if you've got a hit in this country, you've got a hit across the world, but sometimes you will get a retailer, say, in Germany who overordered and we can take the stock off their hands. If we can do that, you can bet we do, because we've got such a small window to sell them. It's not in our interests to short-ship the trade.' </p> <p>Talking to me a few months after the great Teletubby shortage of 1997, the programme's creator, Anne Wood, was still distraught. 'I felt awful,' she said. 'I was really unhappy. It certainly wasn't engineered. It was just that the response to the programme was way, way beyond what anyone anticipated.' </p> <p>That was the year that the phrase 'toy rage' began routinely appearing in the press. In one incident, Gerry Masters of the British Association of Toy Retailers was going to give a TV interview at a branch of Toys 'R' Us, holding up a Teletubby doll while discussing the shortage. The interview was cancelled after the shop couldn't guarantee his safety. </p> <p>Perhaps, in the end, this isn't about children at all. In the year of the Great Teletubby Shortage, the show was my son's favourite. And I wanted him to have a doll for Christmas. Once it became clear that this might be difficult, however, his grandmothers decided that he must have all four. They worked together with admirable efficiency, mobilising battalions of friends to comb the shelves of almost every Mothercare and Woolworths in the country. They queued, they plotted, they flexed their bus passes and left no shopping centre unturned in their quest. On Christmas Day, he had his very own Tinky Twinky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po. And he was happy. Although, being only a toddler, he found the wrapping paper and boxes for all his presents just as much fun to play with as the toys themselves. </p> <p>Three years on, the four Tubbies sit abandoned on a high shelf in his room, all but ignored. But our mums are still telling their battle stories from the Great Campaign of 1997, laughing as they swap tales with friends who fought when Buzz Lightyear sent queues to infinity and beyond. This year, both nans are determined to get him Tracy Island and all the matching Thunderbirds accessories, despite the shortages. I'm not sure he really wants them. And I'm definite he doesn't need them. But it's Christmas, and who am I to deny them their little pleasures?</p> <p><strong>Toy story 2</strong></p> <p><strong>1901 Meccano</strong></p> <p>Conceived by Frank Hornby, a clerk at a Liverpool meat importers during a train journey one Christmas Eve, the first 'Mechanics Made Easy' sets featured 17 parts that could be made into 12 different objects for 7/6 (37.5p). The Meccano name was trademarked six years later, and although the product peaked in the 30s, it was made in Liverpool until the late 70s, and is still produced today by a French manufacturer.</p> <p><strong>1902 Teddy bears</strong></p> <p>On 16 November, the Washington Post published a Clifford Berryman cartoon celebrating an incident in which US president Teddy Roosevelt had apparently refused to shoot a captured bear produced to liven up an unsuccessful hunting trip in Mississippi. Russian immigrants Morris and Rose Michtom subsequently put a stuffed Teddy bear in the window of their novelty and stationery shop in Brooklyn, New York, and later began manufacturing them. Meanwhile, German toymaker Margarete Steiff had begun making jointed cuddly toy animals, with the bears selling especially well in the US - sparking a global craze for teddies.</p> <p><strong>1903 Crayola crayons</strong></p> <p>Cousins Edwin Binney and Harold C Smith launched their first box of eight coloured crayons. Their company in Pennsylvania produced its 100-billionth crayon in 1996: no one has counted the number of hours parents have spent scrubbing walls clean in between times.</p> <p><strong>1925 Hornby train sets</strong></p> <p>Frank Hornby's company launched their first electric trains sets, operated from a mains supply of 100-250v - which must have been a shocking experience. A safer version came on to the market four years later.</p> <p><strong>1929 The yo-yo</strong></p> <p>Pedro Flores began selling a traditional toy that had once been used as a weapon in his native Philippines in California in 1928. Donald Duncan bought the business shortly after and began aggressively marketing the toy, recruiting stars such as Bing Crosby, who recorded 'My Little Yo-Yo'. In 1930, he brought teams of demonstrators over to Europe to tour the music halls. The toy's fortunes have gone up and down ever since: in the 1998 revival, 30m of them sold in the UK alone.</p> <p><strong>1930 Mickey Mouse dolls</strong></p> <p>Mickey made his debut in 1928, but the first dolls were made by Charlotte Clarke two years later, selling at $4.95 - an extraordinary sum in the middle of the Depression - and forever sealing the bond between cartoons and kids' toys. Tie-ins with McDonald's took rather longer to arrange. </p> <p><strong>1934 Dinky toys</strong></p> <p>Die-cast miniature vehicles launched.</p> <p><strong>1935 Monopoly</strong></p> <p>A board game called The Landlord's Game was patented in 1903 by Lizzie J Magie, a young Quaker who saw it as a way of teaching the evils of land monopolism. Over the years, players adapted the rules and added new features, and the game was finally packaged into its current form by Charles Darrow of Philadelphia. He sold it to Parker Brothers in 1935, when it became the bestselling game in the USA. More than 200m sets have since been sold worldwide, containing more than 5bn little green houses.</p> <p><strong>1949 Cluedo</strong></p> <p>Mystery board game invented by Anthony Pratt, a solicitor's clerk from Birmingham, and launched by Waddington's in Leeds. It's been a massive international success, with local variations: in Norway, Mrs Peacock is Baronesse von Blau, while in Spain she's a man called Capitano Azurro; in Germany, Miss Scarlet is Fraulein Ming; in Switzerland, Colonel Mustard is known as Madam Curry.</p> <p><strong>1952 Mr Potato Head</strong></p> <p>A pack of plastic eyes, mouths and noses to turn your fruit and veg into toys, this $1 novelty sold 1m in the US in its first year, with West Coast retailers paying for them to be flown in from new toy manufacturer Hasbro's East Coast base to keep shelves stocked. Became a hot item again after being featured in Disney's Toy Story in 1996.</p> <p><strong>1953 Slinky</strong></p> <p>The spring which walks down stairs now usually comes in multicoloured plastic. The original metal version was invented by American Richard James in 1943 as an anti-vibration device for ships' instruments. It failed, but made it big as a toy instead.</p> <p><strong>1954 Sooty</strong></p> <p>Electrical engineer/part-time magician Harry Corbett bought a Chad Valley glove puppet in a Blackpool shop to entertain his children. After he and Sooty won a Manchester talent competition together in 1952, the BBC offered him a TV series and its success made Sooty the must-have toy ofthe year. It's since become a family franchise - Harry's son Matthew now has his hand in it.</p> <p><strong>1955 Scrabble</strong></p> <p>Invented by American architect Alfred Butt in 1932 under the name Lexico, it was rejected by all the major toy manufacturers and was a failure when it first came out under the name of Criss Cross Words. It was sold to James Brunot, who changed the name to Scrabble. Launched in the UK in the mid-50s, now more than half the households in Britain have a set.</p> <p><strong>1957 Scalextric</strong></p> <p>In 1952 a small British company called Minimodels launched Scalex, a range of metal cars with a keyless clockwork motor. The electric version followed five years later, and has been a favourite ever since with immature males - who sometimes let their sons play with it, too.</p> <p><strong>1958 Hula Hoop</strong></p> <p>A craze made in America inspired by Australian children exercising with a bamboo hoop, this is the toy that really launched plastic. More than 20m were sold in the UK, yet there were still Christmas shortages. Frisbees (invented the year before at the Frisbee Pie Factory) were also big.</p> <p><strong>1959 Barbie</strong></p> <p>A cleaned-up version of Lilli, a sexy German doll based on a newspaper cartoon and aimed at adult males, Mattel's new toy created controversy at a time when it was generally thought that girls wanted baby dolls to play with and that toys should not have breasts. Launched with coast-to-coast TV advertising in the US, it sold so quickly that it was three years before the factories could keep pace with demand.</p> <p><strong>1960 Lego</strong></p> <p>Ole Kirk Christiansen was a carpenter from the small town of Billund, Denmark, who started selling wooden toys in 1932 under the name Lego (leg godt is Danish for 'play well'). It was his son Godtfred who saw the potential in the new plastics and developed the classic Lego brick, which now sells 100m sets annually. The company is still based in Billund, and run by Godtfred's son Kjeld.</p> <p><strong>1963 Sindy</strong></p> <p>Britain's Barbie clone stepped out of her box wearing a stripy T-shirt and jeans outfit and \u00ba \u00aa sporting a strange bouffant hairdo in a choice of blonde or brunette shades. She didn't shape up in the beauty-queen stakes until sold to US toy giant Hasbro by Pedigree in 1986. Meanwhile, British boys celebrated the fact that Matchbox cars came for the first time this year with doors that actually opened!</p> <p><strong>1964 GI Joe</strong></p> <p>America's Movable Fighting Man made his TV advertising debut in New York, and despite initial fears that boys wouldn't play will dolls, it did $5.3m worth of business in its first year, $23m a year later. He was known as Action Man when posted overseas, but he didn't see service in Britain for two more years. In 1964, we were consumed instead with a craze for ugly, squat dolls with fluorescent spiky hair that pre-dated punk by 13 years. They were trolls - as promoted by Diana Dors.</p> <p><strong>1965 James Bond Aston Martin</strong></p> <p>The ultimate in model motoring, complete with pop-up machine guns, the Corgi car sold out just before Christmas, as did the best-selling toy of the year, Spirograph.</p> <p><strong>1971 Clackers (aka Klik Klaks)</strong></p> <p>Two hard plastic balls suspended on string, which banged together hypnotically. In theory, a few wrist flicks could produce all kinds of tricks; in practice, you ended up with bloody knuckles and bruised wrists. This was also the year of the Space Hopper, a giant ball with ears that you sat on and bounced along. In theory.</p> <p><strong>1973 Mastermind</strong></p> <p>The board game of the television series had to 'pass' on many potential seasonal sales when the manufacturers ran out of plastic.</p> <p><strong>1978 Star Wars toys</strong></p> <p>A success story that redefined Hollywood's relationship with the toy industry, with $100m worth of action figures sold in the US alone the year after the movie took off.</p> <p><strong>1980 Rubik's cube</strong></p> <p>Designed by Hungarian professor Erno Rubik, it flooded the shops just before Christmas and ended up in almost every present pile that year. There were international cube contests, books written on how to solve it, a health scare about wrist strain. And within two years all of them were gathering dust in corners, never to be seen again.</p> <p><strong>1984 Cabbage Patch Kids</strong></p> <p>Invented by Xavier 'Happy' Roberts in Georgia in 1976, each homely stuffed doll came with a birth certificate and they were offered for adoption rather than for sale. He sold as many as could be made - 2.8m of them - in 1983, and Cabbage Patch fever raged for the following three years. There were reports of desperate American parents flying to the UK to find dolls, while anxious shoppers responding to a newspaper ad in New York and Los Angeles promising 'Send $34.95 and we will send you a Cabbage Patch' were rewarded with packets of cabbage seeds.</p> <p><strong>1985 Transformers</strong></p> <p>An adaptation of a popular Japanese toy, robots which turned into vehicles and weapons. Christmas shortages caused riots in the US in 1984, with reports of a mother trampled in the rush outside a toy store in Virginia. They were Britain's top-selling toy a year later.</p> <p><strong>1989 Nintendo GameBoy</strong></p> <p>The re-emerging computer-games market increasingly blurred the line between children's toys and adult diversion: the hand-held GameBoy cost a hefty \u00a370 and appealed to yuppies, teens and kids alike.</p> <p><strong>1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</strong></p> <p>The children's cartoon based on a satirical comic aimed at an older audience made its UK TV debut in February; by May, the first stories of toy shortages began to appear. By Christmas, there were queues everywhere. Six years later, pet terrapins bought during the Ninja craze and dumped when they grew alarmingly big began turning up in sewers across the country and were caught savaging wild birds at a nature reserve in Cornwall.</p> <p><strong>1992 Tracy Island</strong></p> <p>A BBC relaunch of the 60s TV favourite Thunderbirds led to acute shortages of this model of the International Rescue HQ, with all-night queues outside some shops and headlines such as 'Thunderbirds are no'.</p> <p><strong>1993 Mortal Kombat</strong></p> <p>The popular arcade video game was released on 'Mortal Monday' for both of the big home consoles: Sega's MegaDrive and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo censored some of the fight game's gore, and Sega drew ahead in the battle of the computer giants. Toy companies missed out as the consoles took over Santa's sacks. By the end of the year, 6m copies of Mortal Kombat had been sold worldwide</p> <p><strong>1994 Power Rangers</strong></p> <p>The new Fox TV network commissioned 40 half-hour episodes of a cheap Japanese series they renamed Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. With the two female rangers helping sell what was essentially a boy toy to girls too, sales of the action figures topped $300m in the US in the first year, and worldwide demand led to long queues and frustrations. In the UK, Toys 'R' Us had to limit them to one per customer. According to the Mail's New York correspondent: 'Last winter, 5,000 fans lined up in Los Angeles to meet a new character, Tommy the Green Ranger, while barely two dozen parents and children waited to see Santa Claus.' By 1995, Tommy had turned white and taken over as leader of the Rangers in the TV series - leading to a severe seasonal drought of white Ranger dolls.</p> <p><strong>1996 Buzz Lightyear dolls</strong></p> <p>Toy Story was a merchandising dream: an animated children's film in which the stars were toys. Yet demand was underestimated, and many didn't get their Christmas Buzz. 'Sales have gone through the roof - we never dreamed that it would be this big,' John Barton, director of the Canadian manufacturer Thinkway Toys told The Mirror. 'We're still making them in China, but there simply aren't enough raw materials or manpower to make enough. We've had a request from President Clinton. And we are even having to ship one to the president of Disney, because she can't get one.'</p> <p><strong>1997 Teletubbies</strong></p> <p>One million dolls went into the shops before Christmas, but demand was for three times as many. There was rationing, all-night queues, and outbreaks of 'toy rage'.

      "bodyText": "Christmas is coming. The lights are up, the shops are crowded, and my five-year-old son is sitting in front of the television repeating a mantra every 30 seconds during the commercial breaks (with pauses only for Barbie ads): 'I want that. I want that. I want that.' Working out what he really wants in the middle of this deluge of advertising is hard enough; but then, if what he's chosen turns out to be this year's favourite, the problem is getting it. Last-minute toy shortages have become such a feature of the festive season that there's even been a Christmas-shopping action movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger's dismal 1996 flop Jingle All The Way , in which he plays a dad battling through the malls on Christmas Eve for that season's must-have toy, a Turboman doll. To prove the clich\u00e9 that it seems to come earlier each year, this time round the Christmas queues started on Thursday 7 September, when shops gave out pre-order forms for Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation 2 computer games console. Forms were strictly rationed, and some shops in London opened at midnight to satisfy demand. By the following Monday, there were none left in most parts of the country, and although the console was released here just two days ago, only customers who ordered in September will be able to collect their hardware in time for Christmas. The delays in manufacturing are due to shortages of various electronic components, not helped the massive success of the console in Japan, where more than 3.52m have been sold since its launch last spring. As a result, Britain will be getting fewer than 200,000 consoles before Christmas, and only 500,000 went on sale in the US on 26 October - half the number originally planned. By early November, the online auction site E-bay was selling consoles at $500 to $600 - double the $299 retail price, and rising. Was it always like this? Every parent fears their child being disappointed on the big day, but I have no recollection of ever opening my presents and feeling let down. But then, my desires were always quite generic: a bike, a bat, a Sindy doll, roller skates. Specific brands or designs rarely seemed important. As for computer games, I remember the Christmas when my brother and I eagerly unwrapped a piece of plastic the size of a small suitcase and connected it to our TV. A mono picture came up, with two short white lines on either side. By manoeuvring the hefty controls, you could move the lines up and down and hit a square 'ball' in the clumsiest tennis game ever seen. Not that this bothered us. We played for hours. This was the cutting edge of leisure technology, an episode of Star Trek come to life in our very own living room. We had seen the future. And its name was Pong. But the 70s were a more innocent time, and not just in terms of the technology available. Children's shows were only on television for a couple of hours a day, and the art of saturation advertising to the young had yet to be perfected. It wasn't until the success of Star Wars in 1977 that film became wedded irrevocably to merchandising, while the deregulation of TV in the early 80s led to shows such as He-Man and Masters of the Universe actually made by toy companies to sell product. From Ninja Turtles to Power Rangers, Batman to Buzz Lightyear, many of the year's Christmas successes since have been tied to films and TV shows. But toy manufacturers also face more competition than ever. As well as toys, your average eight-year-old may well be asking for a replica football kit or expensive trainers, a Spice Girls or Westlife CD, computer games and hardware - Toys 'R' Us even stocks mobile phones now. And no matter how sophisticated the marketing, children constantly surprise - take the yo-yo craze of 1998, in which 30m of them were sold in the UK alone without any aggressive marketing. Many toy manufacturers have gone bankrupt due to the failure of one toy, and even successful products can disappoint. Having sold 3m Star Wars books to tie in with the new film, children's publisher Dorling Kindersley ordered a print run of 9m more to cope with a Christmas rush that never materialised, and were destroyed. The giant toy corporation Hasbro also announced lower than expected profits after their Star Wars lines failed to perform as expected. At the moment, says Allen of the toy giant Mattel, her company is talking to the big retailers about Christmas. Christmas 2001, that is. By February, nearly all the big manufacturers will have shown their new lines at the annual toy fairs, and will be forecasting how many of each to make. But it's an inexact science. 'With perennial favourites like Barbie and Action Man, you can tell year on year more or less where they will sit in the market. What you can't predict is what the competition is going to do to you. And then you've got crazes like Pok\u00e9mon cards or yo-yos that suddenly appear. Throughout the year, the retailers could change their forecasts, other things could come on the market. Which is why you'll suddenly see an awful lot of toys discounted because somebody got their forecasting wrong and produced too much, and you'll get things that have been a big success that are in short supply.' This year's shortage looks set to be a familiar one. Taken by surprise by the success of the BBC's revival of its 60s children's series Thunderbirds , in 1992 shops quickly ran out of the model of Tracy Island, the Thunderbirds HQ. Although the show was again revived by the BBC this autumn, no one expected it to have the same impact the third time around. So Thunderbirds are no once more. The company behind Tracy Island, Vivid Imaginations, says that it is too big and heavy to bring over from factories in Far East by air, but extra supplies will be shipped in before Christmas. And Hamleys is expecting a limited stock of it to arrive in store in December, though it admits that it probably won't satisfy demand. At Mattel, Sarah Allen says there's only so much that can be done at this point. 'Usually, if you've got a hit in this country, you've got a hit across the world, but sometimes you will get a retailer, say, in Germany who overordered and we can take the stock off their hands. If we can do that, you can bet we do, because we've got such a small window to sell them. It's not in our interests to short-ship the trade.' Talking to me a few months after the great Teletubby shortage of 1997, the programme's creator, Anne Wood, was still distraught. 'I felt awful,' she said. 'I was really unhappy. It certainly wasn't engineered. It was just that the response to the programme was way, way beyond what anyone anticipated.' That was the year that the phrase 'toy rage' began routinely appearing in the press. In one incident, Gerry Masters of the British Association of Toy Retailers was going to give a TV interview at a branch of Toys 'R' Us, holding up a Teletubby doll while discussing the shortage. The interview was cancelled after the shop couldn't guarantee his safety. Perhaps, in the end, this isn't about children at all. In the year of the Great Teletubby Shortage, the show was my son's favourite. And I wanted him to have a doll for Christmas. Once it became clear that this might be difficult, however, his grandmothers decided that he must have all four. They worked together with admirable efficiency, mobilising battalions of friends to comb the shelves of almost every Mothercare and Woolworths in the country. They queued, they plotted, they flexed their bus passes and left no shopping centre unturned in their quest. On Christmas Day, he had his very own Tinky Twinky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po. And he was happy. Although, being only a toddler, he found the wrapping paper and boxes for all his presents just as much fun to play with as the toys themselves. Three years on, the four Tubbies sit abandoned on a high shelf in his room, all but ignored. But our mums are still telling their battle stories from the Great Campaign of 1997, laughing as they swap tales with friends who fought when Buzz Lightyear sent queues to infinity and beyond. This year, both nans are determined to get him Tracy Island and all the matching Thunderbirds accessories, despite the shortages. I'm not sure he really wants them. And I'm definite he doesn't need them. But it's Christmas, and who am I to deny them their little pleasures? Toy story 2 1901 Meccano Conceived by Frank Hornby, a clerk at a Liverpool meat importers during a train journey one Christmas Eve, the first 'Mechanics Made Easy' sets featured 17 parts that could be made into 12 different objects for 7/6 (37.5p). The Meccano name was trademarked six years later, and although the product peaked in the 30s, it was made in Liverpool until the late 70s, and is still produced today by a French manufacturer. 1902 Teddy bears On 16 November, the Washington Post published a Clifford Berryman cartoon celebrating an incident in which US president Teddy Roosevelt had apparently refused to shoot a captured bear produced to liven up an unsuccessful hunting trip in Mississippi. Russian immigrants Morris and Rose Michtom subsequently put a stuffed Teddy bear in the window of their novelty and stationery shop in Brooklyn, New York, and later began manufacturing them. Meanwhile, German toymaker Margarete Steiff had begun making jointed cuddly toy animals, with the bears selling especially well in the US - sparking a global craze for teddies. 1903 Crayola crayons Cousins Edwin Binney and Harold C Smith launched their first box of eight coloured crayons. Their company in Pennsylvania produced its 100-billionth crayon in 1996: no one has counted the number of hours parents have spent scrubbing walls clean in between times. 1925 Hornby train sets Frank Hornby's company launched their first electric trains sets, operated from a mains supply of 100-250v - which must have been a shocking experience. A safer version came on to the market four years later. 1929 The yo-yo Pedro Flores began selling a traditional toy that had once been used as a weapon in his native Philippines in California in 1928. Donald Duncan bought the business shortly after and began aggressively marketing the toy, recruiting stars such as Bing Crosby, who recorded 'My Little Yo-Yo'. In 1930, he brought teams of demonstrators over to Europe to tour the music halls. The toy's fortunes have gone up and down ever since: in the 1998 revival, 30m of them sold in the UK alone. 1930 Mickey Mouse dolls Mickey made his debut in 1928, but the first dolls were made by Charlotte Clarke two years later, selling at $4.95 - an extraordinary sum in the middle of the Depression - and forever sealing the bond between cartoons and kids' toys. Tie-ins with McDonald's took rather longer to arrange. 1934 Dinky toys Die-cast miniature vehicles launched. 1935 Monopoly A board game called The Landlord's Game was patented in 1903 by Lizzie J Magie, a young Quaker who saw it as a way of teaching the evils of land monopolism. Over the years, players adapted the rules and added new features, and the game was finally packaged into its current form by Charles Darrow of Philadelphia. He sold it to Parker Brothers in 1935, when it became the bestselling game in the USA. More than 200m sets have since been sold worldwide, containing more than 5bn little green houses. 1949 Cluedo Mystery board game invented by Anthony Pratt, a solicitor's clerk from Birmingham, and launched by Waddington's in Leeds. It's been a massive international success, with local variations: in Norway, Mrs Peacock is Baronesse von Blau, while in Spain she's a man called Capitano Azurro; in Germany, Miss Scarlet is Fraulein Ming; in Switzerland, Colonel Mustard is known as Madam Curry. 1952 Mr Potato Head A pack of plastic eyes, mouths and noses to turn your fruit and veg into toys, this $1 novelty sold 1m in the US in its first year, with West Coast retailers paying for them to be flown in from new toy manufacturer Hasbro's East Coast base to keep shelves stocked. Became a hot item again after being featured in Disney's Toy Story in 1996. 1953 Slinky The spring which walks down stairs now usually comes in multicoloured plastic. The original metal version was invented by American Richard James in 1943 as an anti-vibration device for ships' instruments. It failed, but made it big as a toy instead. 1954 Sooty Electrical engineer/part-time magician Harry Corbett bought a Chad Valley glove puppet in a Blackpool shop to entertain his children. After he and Sooty won a Manchester talent competition together in 1952, the BBC offered him a TV series and its success made Sooty the must-have toy ofthe year. It's since become a family franchise - Harry's son Matthew now has his hand in it. 1955 Scrabble Invented by American architect Alfred Butt in 1932 under the name Lexico, it was rejected by all the major toy manufacturers and was a failure when it first came out under the name of Criss Cross Words. It was sold to James Brunot, who changed the name to Scrabble. Launched in the UK in the mid-50s, now more than half the households in Britain have a set. 1957 Scalextric In 1952 a small British company called Minimodels launched Scalex, a range of metal cars with a keyless clockwork motor. The electric version followed five years later, and has been a favourite ever since with immature males - who sometimes let their sons play with it, too. 1958 Hula Hoop A craze made in America inspired by Australian children exercising with a bamboo hoop, this is the toy that really launched plastic. More than 20m were sold in the UK, yet there were still Christmas shortages. Frisbees (invented the year before at the Frisbee Pie Factory) were also big. 1959 Barbie A cleaned-up version of Lilli, a sexy German doll based on a newspaper cartoon and aimed at adult males, Mattel's new toy created controversy at a time when it was generally thought that girls wanted baby dolls to play with and that toys should not have breasts. Launched with coast-to-coast TV advertising in the US, it sold so quickly that it was three years before the factories could keep pace with demand. 1960 Lego Ole Kirk Christiansen was a carpenter from the small town of Billund, Denmark, who started selling wooden toys in 1932 under the name Lego (leg godt is Danish for 'play well'). It was his son Godtfred who saw the potential in the new plastics and developed the classic Lego brick, which now sells 100m sets annually. The company is still based in Billund, and run by Godtfred's son Kjeld. 1963 Sindy Britain's Barbie clone stepped out of her box wearing a stripy T-shirt and jeans outfit and \u00ba \u00aa sporting a strange bouffant hairdo in a choice of blonde or brunette shades. She didn't shape up in the beauty-queen stakes until sold to US toy giant Hasbro by Pedigree in 1986. Meanwhile, British boys celebrated the fact that Matchbox cars came for the first time this year with doors that actually opened! 1964 GI Joe America's Movable Fighting Man made his TV advertising debut in New York, and despite initial fears that boys wouldn't play will dolls, it did $5.3m worth of business in its first year, $23m a year later. He was known as Action Man when posted overseas, but he didn't see service in Britain for two more years. In 1964, we were consumed instead with a craze for ugly, squat dolls with fluorescent spiky hair that pre-dated punk by 13 years. They were trolls - as promoted by Diana Dors. 1965 James Bond Aston Martin The ultimate in model motoring, complete with pop-up machine guns, the Corgi car sold out just before Christmas, as did the best-selling toy of the year, Spirograph. 1971 Clackers (aka Klik Klaks) Two hard plastic balls suspended on string, which banged together hypnotically. In theory, a few wrist flicks could produce all kinds of tricks; in practice, you ended up with bloody knuckles and bruised wrists. This was also the year of the Space Hopper, a giant ball with ears that you sat on and bounced along. In theory. 1973 Mastermind The board game of the television series had to 'pass' on many potential seasonal sales when the manufacturers ran out of plastic. 1978 Star Wars toys A success story that redefined Hollywood's relationship with the toy industry, with $100m worth of action figures sold in the US alone the year after the movie took off. 1980 Rubik's cube Designed by Hungarian professor Erno Rubik, it flooded the shops just before Christmas and ended up in almost every present pile that year. There were international cube contests, books written on how to solve it, a health scare about wrist strain. And within two years all of them were gathering dust in corners, never to be seen again. 1984 Cabbage Patch Kids Invented by Xavier 'Happy' Roberts in Georgia in 1976, each homely stuffed doll came with a birth certificate and they were offered for adoption rather than for sale. He sold as many as could be made - 2.8m of them - in 1983, and Cabbage Patch fever raged for the following three years. There were reports of desperate American parents flying to the UK to find dolls, while anxious shoppers responding to a newspaper ad in New York and Los Angeles promising 'Send $34.95 and we will send you a Cabbage Patch' were rewarded with packets of cabbage seeds. 1985 Transformers An adaptation of a popular Japanese toy, robots which turned into vehicles and weapons. Christmas shortages caused riots in the US in 1984, with reports of a mother trampled in the rush outside a toy store in Virginia. They were Britain's top-selling toy a year later. 1989 Nintendo GameBoy The re-emerging computer-games market increasingly blurred the line between children's toys and adult diversion: the hand-held GameBoy cost a hefty \u00a370 and appealed to yuppies, teens and kids alike. 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The children's cartoon based on a satirical comic aimed at an older audience made its UK TV debut in February; by May, the first stories of toy shortages began to appear. By Christmas, there were queues everywhere. Six years later, pet terrapins bought during the Ninja craze and dumped when they grew alarmingly big began turning up in sewers across the country and were caught savaging wild birds at a nature reserve in Cornwall. 1992 Tracy Island A BBC relaunch of the 60s TV favourite Thunderbirds led to acute shortages of this model of the International Rescue HQ, with all-night queues outside some shops and headlines such as 'Thunderbirds are no'. 1993 Mortal Kombat The popular arcade video game was released on 'Mortal Monday' for both of the big home consoles: Sega's MegaDrive and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo censored some of the fight game's gore, and Sega drew ahead in the battle of the computer giants. Toy companies missed out as the consoles took over Santa's sacks. By the end of the year, 6m copies of Mortal Kombat had been sold worldwide 1994 Power Rangers The new Fox TV network commissioned 40 half-hour episodes of a cheap Japanese series they renamed Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. With the two female rangers helping sell what was essentially a boy toy to girls too, sales of the action figures topped $300m in the US in the first year, and worldwide demand led to long queues and frustrations. In the UK, Toys 'R' Us had to limit them to one per customer. According to the Mail's New York correspondent: 'Last winter, 5,000 fans lined up in Los Angeles to meet a new character, Tommy the Green Ranger, while barely two dozen parents and children waited to see Santa Claus.' By 1995, Tommy had turned white and taken over as leader of the Rangers in the TV series - leading to a severe seasonal drought of white Ranger dolls. 1996 Buzz Lightyear dolls Toy Story was a merchandising dream: an animated children's film in which the stars were toys. Yet demand was underestimated, and many didn't get their Christmas Buzz. 'Sales have gone through the roof - we never dreamed that it would be this big,' John Barton, director of the Canadian manufacturer Thinkway Toys told The Mirror. 'We're still making them in China, but there simply aren't enough raw materials or manpower to make enough. We've had a request from President Clinton. And we are even having to ship one to the president of Disney, because she can't get one.' 1997 Teletubbies One million dolls went into the shops before Christmas, but demand was for three times as many. There was rationing, all-night queues, and outbreaks of 'toy rage'. One mother and grandmother were charged with assault after trying to snatch dolls from another customer's trolley in a Kent branch of Toys 'R' Us. 1998 Furby The interactive 'pet' caused the longest Christmas queues - by New Year's Eve, parents had realised that it didn't have an off switch, and those who had failed to buy one were sobbing with relief.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Lucy Moore</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> The Journals of Sylvia Plath </strong> edited by <strong> Karen V. Kukil</strong> (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. </p> <p><strong>Lewis Wolpert</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist</strong> (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. <strong> Hitler's Gift</strong>, by<strong> Jean Medawar and David Pyke</strong> (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. </p> <p><strong>Simon Jenkins</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> White Teeth</strong> (Random House) by <strong> Zadie Smith </strong> is funny and sad. <strong> Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats <strong> Andrew Rawnsley's </strong> gossipy <strong> Servants of the People </strong> (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for <strong> Gladwyn Turbutt's </strong> four-volume <strong> History of Derbyshire</strong> (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. </p> <p><strong>Barbara Trapido</strong><br></p> <p> While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was <strong> G\u00fcnther Grass's </strong> time travelling, massively long <strong> Too Far Afield </strong> (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, <strong> Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club </strong> (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with <strong> Romesh Gunesekera's </strong> beautiful exile story, <strong> The Sandglass </strong> (Granta). </p> <p><strong>Robert Harris</strong><br> </p> <p> The latest selection from <strong> Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics </strong> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. </p> <p> <strong> Graham Robb's Rimbaud</strong> (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. <strong> Penelope Fitzgerald</strong>, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, <strong> The Means of Escape </strong> (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. </p> <p><strong>Joan Bakewell</strong><br>L </p> <p> <strong> J. G. Ballard </strong> has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now <strong> Super-Cannes </strong> (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, <strong> Richard Holmes</strong> is always interesting. <strong> Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer</strong> (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. <strong> Experience</strong> by <strong> Martin Amis </strong> (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. </p> <p><strong> Zadie Smith</strong><br> </p> <p> I choose <strong> Martin Amis's </strong> memoir <strong> Experience</strong> (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, <strong> Edward Platt's </strong> intimate biography of the A40, <strong> Leadville </strong> (Picador), for the same reason, and <strong> Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</strong> (Picador) because it kicks ass. </p> <p><strong>Misha Glenny</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History </strong> (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. <strong> Night of Stone </strong> (Granta) , <strong> Catherine Merridale's </strong> account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. <strong> Kosovo: War and Revenge</strong> (Yale), <strong> Tim Judah's </strong> reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. </p> <p><strong>Nicci Gerard</strong><br> </p> <p> In <strong> The Human Stain </strong> (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - <strong> Philip Roth </strong> manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, <strong> Philip Pullman</strong> published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, <strong> The Amber Spyglass </strong> (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Frayling</strong><br></p> <p> I particularly enjoyed <strong> David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture</strong> (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was <strong> Thomas McGuane's</strong> elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as <strong> Some Horses </strong> (The Lyons Press). </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Meades</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Atomised</strong> by <strong> Michel Houllebecq </strong> (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In<strong> The Third Reich: A New History </strong> (Macmillan), <strong> Michael Burleigh</strong> proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. </p> <p><strong>Brenda Maddox</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan </strong> (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous <strong> Letters of Kingsley Amis</strong> edited by <strong> Zachary Leader </strong> (HarperCollins). </p> <p> <strong>Antony Holden</strong><br> </p> <p> Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. <strong> Martin Amis's</strong> memoir <strong> Experience</strong> (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired <strong> Miranda Seymour's</strong> exhaustive biography of <strong> Mary Shelley. </strong> </p> <p><strong>Charles Saumarez Smith</strong><br></p> <p> My favourite book of the year is called <strong> City Secrets: Rome</strong> (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect <strong> Robert Kahn</strong>, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed <strong> The Long Afternoon </strong> (Sceptre), <strong> Giles Waterfield's</strong> dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. </p> <p><strong>Jan Morris</strong><br> </p> <p> In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed <strong> Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also <strong> Peter Ackroyd's </strong> virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, <strong> London: The Biography</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by <strong> Miles Bredin's</strong> life of James Bruce, <strong> The Pale Abyssinian</strong> (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. </p> <p><strong>Mary Riddell</strong><br> </p> <p> As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed <strong> Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters </strong> (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. </p> <p> <strong>Tom Paulin</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies</strong> (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). <strong> Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. </p> <p><strong>Edna O'Brien</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Snow and Guilt </strong> by <strong> Giorgio Pressburger </strong> (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for <strong> The Journals of Sylvia Plath</strong> (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. <strong> Eilis Ni Dhuibhne</strong> is the most gifted young Irish writer. In <strong> The Pale Gold of Alaska</strong> (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. </p> <p><strong>George Steiner</strong><br> </p> <p> My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is <strong> Colin Thubron's In Siberia </strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. </p> <p><strong>Gita Sereny</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna</strong> is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. <strong> Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding </strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with <strong> Ian Kershaw's</strong> two volumes of Hitler biography - <strong> Hubris</strong> and <strong> Nemesis </strong> (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved <strong> Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin</strong> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). <strong> George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain</strong> (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved <strong> Kent Haruf 's Plainsong</strong> and <strong> Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love</strong> (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read <strong> Robert Harris's Archangel </strong> (Arrow), <strong> Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement </strong> (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by <strong> Michael Connelly</strong> (Orion). </p> <p><strong>Mavis Cheek</strong><br> </p> <p> 'Not for horrid profs,' says <strong> Frank Kermode </strong> of his <strong> Shakespeare's Language</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called <strong> Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship</strong> (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With <strong> The World's Smallest Unicorn</strong> (Cape),<strong> Shena Mackay </strong> brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. </p> <p><strong> A L Kennedy</strong><br> </p> <p> This year <strong> No Great Mischief</strong> (Cape) made <strong> Alistair MacLeod</strong>'s position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. </p> <p><strong>Terry Eagleton</strong><br> </p> <p> Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time. To write the very best book on him to date is thus a remarkable achievement. <strong> Ken Hirschkop's Mikhail Bakhtin: An Aesthetic for Democracy</strong> (OUP) combines dogged work in the Russian archives with some brilliant insights to show Bakhtin's relevance to questions of politics and popular democracy today. </p> <p><strong>Glen Baxter</strong><br> </p> <p> My contenders for book of the year would have to include <strong> Flick Knives and Forks</strong> (Zillah Bell Contemporary Art) by <strong> Anthony Earnshaw</strong> - a collection of the great English surrealists' aphorisms spiced with black humour. My next choice would be <strong> The Book of Leviathan</strong> (Sort of Books) by <strong> Peter Bleguad</strong> which is funny, enigmatic and beautifully limned - what more could one ask? </p> <p><strong>Hermione Lee</strong> </p> <p> My book of the year is the <strong> Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai</strong> (Faber) edited by his friend <strong> Ted Hughes</strong> and by <strong> Daniel Weissbort. </strong> His wry, conversational poems - tender, humane and pragmatic - on war, love, memory, and the fierce history of his city, Jerusalem, are all the more moving now. I was also delighted by the dazzling stories of <strong> Peter Ho Davies, Equal Love </strong> (Granta) , and by <strong> Mich\u00e8le Roberts's </strong> deliciously sensual French novel, <strong> The Looking Glass</strong> (Virago). </p> <p> <strong>Helen Dunmore</strong><br> </p> <p> It's seven years since <strong> Michael Donaghy</strong> last published a poetry collection. Here, after a magical interval, is <strong> Conjure</strong> (Picador), his best book yet. Conjure takes all the Donaghy virtues - wit, clarity, breathtaking control of rhyme and rhythm - and adds a new intensity of feeling. </p> <p><strong>David Hare</strong><br> </p> <p> Why do women write about the recent past so much better than men? Only John Osborne has described the day before yesterday as skilfully as Barbara Skelton, Doris Lessing and Joan Wyndham. <strong> Stet</strong> (Granta), is a record of <strong> Diana Athill's</strong> years as an editor at Andre Deutsch. It's hard to believe that most of her authors came anywhere near Athill's own superb literary pitch. Over the internet you can order the American edition of <strong> The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Volume 1 1920-1945</strong> (New Directions) - essential reading for admirers of one of America's greatest dramatists </p> <p> <strong>Emma Tennant</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Lorna Sage's Bad Blood </strong> (Fourth Estate) is a deceptively simple account of a Second World War childhood in deepest Flintshire, which makes sense of the enormous and bewildering changes in society in the last century. </p> <p> <strong>Michael Foot</strong><br></p> <p> Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that <strong> Rebecca West</strong> was not one of the great women of the century. Her <strong> Selected Letters</strong>, edited by <strong> Bonnie Kime Scott</strong> (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions. She would have appreciated the latest of essays from her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, <strong> Merlin Holland's The Oscar Wilde Anthology</strong> (HarperCollins). And don't miss <strong> Have You Forgotten Yet? The First World War Memoirs of C P Blacker</strong>, edited by <strong> John Blacker</strong> (Pen and Sword Books ), an original, plain-spoken record of the First World War which confronts the reader fairly with the Siegfried Sassoon verdict on the whole affair. </p> <p><strong>Adam Phillips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> R. F. Langley's Collected Poems</strong> (Carcanet) has a new music of sense-making about it that is, in the way only poetry and music can be, like an illumination. <strong> Larry Siedentop's Democracy In Europe</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) has a remarkable clarity and exhilaration about something that runs the risk of becoming just another topic of debate. <strong> Richard Lewontin</strong> with <strong> The Triple Helix </strong> (Harvard) continues to be the scientist everyone should read. </p> <p><strong>J G Ballard</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> In The Heart Of The Sea </strong> by Nathaniel Philbrick (HarperCollins) is a deeply moving account of the sinking of the whale ship Essex , which inspired Melville's Moby Dick. Rammed by a sperm whale, the Essex sank three days later, and the survivors set out by boat for the South American coast, 4,000 miles away. Nathaniel Philbrick unsparingly describes their ordeal, a hellish descent into starvation and cannibalism. None the less, these desperate men emerge as heroes. </p> <p><strong>Philip French</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> George Orwell</strong> is possibly the greatest writer of the twentieth century and next year's major publishing event will be the paperback editions at affordable prices of the first three volumes of his complete essays, letters and diaries: <strong> All Propaganda is Lies 1941-42</strong>, <strong> Keeping Our Little Corner Clean</strong> and <strong> Two Wasted Years 1943</strong> (Secker &amp; Warburg). My three new favourites all address themselves to settling the business of the last century. <strong> Douglas Dunn's </strong> vivid book-length poem <strong> The Donkey's Ears</strong> (Faber), purports to be the letters home to his wife by the self-questioning flag engineer of the Russian fleet steaming from the Baltic to the East China Sea to be destroyed by the Japanese in May 1905. </p> <p> <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) magnificently completes the informal trilogy about post-war America that Roth began with American Pastoral and I Married a Communist. My film choice is Christopher Frayling's <strong> Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death </strong> (Faber), a fascinating biography that locates a great director in the complex social and cultural context of twentieth-century Italy. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Motion</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Derek Mahon</strong> has always been a busy reviser and re-presenter of his own work. His latest <strong> Selected Poems</strong> (Penguin) is his best shot yet at self-definition - a wonderfully varied, skilful and abundant book by a writer who is working at his formidable best. Wordsworth was a grand old tinkerer, too, and watching him chop and change is just one of the fascinations of <strong> Juliet Barker's </strong> enormous, and enormously sympathetic, biography <strong> Wordsworth: A Life</strong> (Viking). And yet another revision: the third edition of <strong> Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan</strong> (Cassell) - the best book there is on Dylan, now better than ever. </p> <p><strong>Peter Conrad</strong><br></p> <p> Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by <strong> Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40</strong> (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. </p> <p><strong>Chris Patten</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the <strong> Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers</strong> (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. </p> <p> <strong>Cressida Connolly</strong><br> </p> <p> The American <strong> Rick Moody</strong> is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, <strong> Demonology</strong> (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed <strong> Kazuo Ishiguro's </strong> extraordinary novel, <strong> When We Were Orphans </strong> (Faber). My best book of the year was <strong> Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I </strong> (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And <strong> John Burnside </strong> 's new poems, the <strong> Asylum Dance</strong> (Cape), are pretty good, too. </p> <p><strong>Steven Berkoff</strong><br> </p> <p> In characteristic style <strong> Peter Ackroyd </strong> pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in <strong> London: The Biography</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. </p> <p> <strong> A Positively Final Appearance </strong> (Penguin) affords another view of London. <strong> Alec Guinness </strong> 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice. A man of consummate taste and culture, he epitomises England, an England unfamiliar to us now but which still surrounds Guinness like a bubble. His reading is Trollope and Anthony Powell, while for comfort he quotes from Montaigne, but all so unpretentiously. This is an actor's actor, a man of culture, breeding and even a defined morality. </p> <p><strong>Martin Amis</strong><br> </p> <p> Fiction: <strong> Saul Bellow's Ravelstein </strong> (Penguin). Non-fiction: <strong> Inside Stalin's Russia: The Diaries of Reader Bullard, 1930-1934 </strong> edited by<strong> Julian and Margaret Bullard</strong> (Day Books). </p> <p>Read part two of Pump Up The Volumes <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bestof2000/story/0,6194,403180,00.html\"> here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lucy Moore The Journals of Sylvia Plath edited by Karen V. Kukil (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. Lewis Wolpert James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. Hitler's Gift, by Jean Medawar and David Pyke (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. Simon Jenkins White Teeth (Random House) by Zadie Smith is funny and sad. Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats Andrew Rawnsley's gossipy Servants of the People (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for Gladwyn Turbutt's four-volume History of Derbyshire (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. Barbara Trapido While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was G\u00fcnther Grass's time travelling, massively long Too Far Afield (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with Romesh Gunesekera's beautiful exile story, The Sandglass (Granta). Robert Harris The latest selection from Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. Graham Robb's Rimbaud (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. Penelope Fitzgerald, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, The Means of Escape (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. Joan Bakewell L J. G. Ballard has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now Super-Cannes (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, Richard Holmes is always interesting. Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. Experience by Martin Amis (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. Zadie Smith I choose Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, Edward Platt's intimate biography of the A40, Leadville (Picador), for the same reason, and Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador) because it kicks ass. Misha Glenny Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. Night of Stone (Granta) , Catherine Merridale's account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale), Tim Judah's reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. Nicci Gerard In The Human Stain (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - Philip Roth manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, Philip Pullman published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, The Amber Spyglass (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. Christopher Frayling I particularly enjoyed David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was Thomas McGuane's elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as Some Horses (The Lyons Press). Jonathan Meades Atomised by Michel Houllebecq (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan), Michael Burleigh proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. Brenda Maddox Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous Letters of Kingsley Amis edited by Zachary Leader (HarperCollins). Antony Holden Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired Miranda Seymour's exhaustive biography of Mary Shelley. Charles Saumarez Smith My favourite book of the year is called City Secrets: Rome (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect Robert Kahn, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed The Long Afternoon (Sceptre), Giles Waterfield's dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. Jan Morris In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also Peter Ackroyd's virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by Miles Bredin's life of James Bruce, The Pale Abyssinian (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. Mary Riddell As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. Tom Paulin Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. Edna O'Brien Snow and Guilt by Giorgio Pressburger (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for The Journals of Sylvia Plath (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. Eilis Ni Dhuibhne is the most gifted young Irish writer. In The Pale Gold of Alaska (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. George Steiner My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is Colin Thubron's In Siberia (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. Gita Sereny Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with Ian Kershaw's two volumes of Hitler biography - Hubris and Nemesis (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved Kent Haruf 's Plainsong and Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read Robert Harris's Archangel (Arrow), Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by Michael Connelly (Orion). Mavis Cheek 'Not for horrid profs,' says Frank Kermode of his Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With The World's Smallest Unicorn (Cape), Shena Mackay brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. A L Kennedy This year No Great Mischief (Cape) made Alistair MacLeod's position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. Terry Eagleton Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time.

Michael Foot Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that Rebecca West was not one of the great women of the century. Her Selected Letters, edited by Bonnie Kime Scott (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions. She would have appreciated the latest of essays from her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Merlin Holland's The Oscar Wilde Anthology (HarperCollins). And don't miss Have You Forgotten Yet?

Peter Conrad Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40 (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. Chris Patten Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. Cressida Connolly The American Rick Moody is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, Demonology (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed Kazuo Ishiguro's extraordinary novel, When We Were Orphans (Faber). My best book of the year was Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And John Burnside 's new poems, the Asylum Dance (Cape), are pretty good, too. Steven Berkoff In characteristic style Peter Ackroyd pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. A Positively Final Appearance (Penguin) affords another view of London. Alec Guinness 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice. A man of consummate taste and culture, he epitomises England, an England unfamiliar to us now but which still surrounds Guinness like a bubble. His reading is Trollope and Anthony Powell, while for comfort he quotes from Montaigne, but all so unpretentiously. This is an actor's actor, a man of culture, breeding and even a defined morality. Martin Amis Fiction: Saul Bellow's Ravelstein (Penguin). Non-fiction: Inside Stalin's Russia: The Diaries of Reader Bullard, 1930-1934 edited by Julian and Margaret Bullard (Day Books).

Assuming that the surveys are beefed up, it will be more difficult to offload a property that has faults. The new system should, therefore, put homeowners under pressure to maintain their properties to avoid nasty surprises when the time comes to sell. As most of us know, property maintenance is expensive and often not budgeted for in the euphoria that goes with the purchase of a property. Even if you have the money, finding reliable experts to put problems right is a hit and miss business. The Government plans a pilot scheme for accrediting builders, and the new house-buying system should focus ministerial minds on homeowners' need to obtain easy access to reliable builders at fair prices.",

He set up a special committee to supervise the counting of ballots and accused the (Democrat-nominated) Supreme Court of his own state, which had ordered the recounts to go ahead, of defying the 'accuracy and fairness' of the vote</p> <p>Thus the battle line between political parties now perfectly divides the supposedly independent machinery assigned to pilot the democratic electoral process.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gore's own tally in the counts that press ahead amid baying crowds in Broward and Palm Beach is rising by numbers closer to his original, optimistic estimates. With Bush's lead down to around 700 and Palm Beach still counting, Gore's hopes have taken another hike, on borrowed time, as the counts move towards the deadline of 5pm today.</p> <p>But whichever way the result finally goes it will be, in Winston Churchill's phrase, no more than 'the end of the beginning'. The casting of votes by the Electoral College next month, and the pomp of the inauguration of either man next January, cannot but be tainted, not only by the events that brought it about, but by the prospect of four years of a Presidency faced by a bare-knuckled opposition bent on subverting what is already being called a coup d'\u00e9tat.</p> <p>One thing is for sure: if the manual recount had gone ahead in the Democrat megalopolis of Miami-Dade, rather than being stopped by the county canvassing board, which said it could not meet today's deadline, Gore would by now be preparing to move offices in the White House, with no thought of moving out. The decision by the board, made up of Democrat Lawrence King and two Democrat-leaning independents, yet again snatched victory from Gore's grasp and was the first, and for the Democrats baffling, defiance of party affiliation in the entire saga. The circumstance led to allegations that the body was intimidated by Republican pressure - from crowds storming the corridors of the civic building and from Florida's heavy-handed Republican Secretary of State, Katherine Harris.</p> <p>Republican militants have been mobilised into rowdy demonstrations which, say the Democrats, have intimidated local authorities with what the aspirant Democrat Vice-President, Joe Lieberman, on Friday night called 'the rule of the mob'.</p> <p>Senator Lieberman accused 'public relations' organisations under the direct authority of the Republican Party of orchestrating the demonstrations, and challenged the party to call them off. Local Democratic representative Peter Deutsch called them a 'paid mob trying to disrupt the result of a fair democratic ballot'.</p> <p>The Republican Party said simply that its mobile rent-a-crowd, which bussed its way from Miami to Broward County on Friday, was made up of angry counting monitors and 'the new face of the Republican Party'.</p> <p>But away from the Florida limelight, in Washington DC, there were stirrings last week that seemed to justify the ire of both Lieberman and Deutsch; signs that the mobs in Florida are the shape of things to come, and visible preparations for a rebellion against an embryonic Gore presidency which would make the conspiracies mounted against Bill Clinton look like a schoolyard game.</p> <p>From the conservative think-tanks to talk radio and the Wall Street Journal, there was a roar of anger from names familiar from the days of the impeachment scandal, who are now coming forward with language they refrained from using even against their betes noires , Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>One of the ring-leaders of America's conservative Right, former Education Secretary William Bennett, threatened that the election would be 'illegitimate' if it were won by Gore, whom he accused of 'trying to steal this election... This may be the worst thing I have ever seen'.</p> <p>His sentiment was echoed by columnists and activists who propelled the impeachment of President Clinton: Peggy Noonan, grande dame of the anti-Clinton hard Right, also accused Gore, in the Wall Street Journal , of 'stealing the election'. The conservative George Will accused the Vice-President of 'slow-motion larceny', and of harbouring a 'corrupting hunger for power'.</p> <p>The pressure groups and publications that built the groundswell for impeachment are back in action: the rhetoric of talk show host Rush Limbaugh has gone into overdrive, and Grover Norquist, leader of the right-wing Americans for Tax Reform, said Gore's team had 'lost the democratic branches of government; they know that in a fair fight they will lose the Presidency, and they are retreating to the redoubt of trial lawyers and politicised judges'.</p> <p>The Bush legal team is led by Theodore Olson, the Washington lawyer who, as chairman of the ultra-right-wing American Spectator magazine, chaired the meeting that first launched the Troopergate scandal and the Paula Jones lawsuit against Clinton which culminated in the Lewinsky and impeachment dramas.</p> <p>Thomas Mann, of the independent Brookings Institution think-tank, said the level of vitriol from conservatives had reached 'the worst of what we saw during the impeachment fervour - unbridled, self-righteous defiance and venom, bordering on McCarthyism, with accusations of traitorous behaviour'.</p> <p>At the same time, the Gore camp was preparing its end-game strategy and assembling the echelons for all-out war against a Bush administration it would claim had failed to win the election, and clung to a bogus victory through 'mob rule' and deploying partisan election officials in Florida.</p> <p>There are dire warnings from Capitol Hill, where the Senate is divided 50-50 and the lower House is controlled only precariously by the Republicans, that for Gore to continue down the apparently endless legal track will make bipartisan politics impossible within a riven legislature. Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey said openly that he thought it 'very unlikely' that Gore could amass the necessary votes, and said it was a 'political risk' to continue to contest the declared results.</p> <p>But campaign manager Bill Daly and the steel core of the campaign, Lieberman, are digging in on a 'no surrender' stance. Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said this was 'hardly a time to fold', insisting he remained 'extremely optimistic' about the final tally.</p> <p>Ronald Klain, Gore's senior legal adviser, has pledged to challenge the returns to date from Miami-Dade county, saying that they 'fail to reflect a full, fair and accurate tally of the votes'.</p> <p>Apart from fury at the influx of Republican mobs, Democrat ire has been directed against the figure of Harris. Gore's lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, calls the Secretary of State 'a crook and an operative', while Paul Begala, Svengali behind the Gore campaign, daubed her 'a dilettante, debutante Republican hack'.</p> <p>If there is no President by tomorrow night, the spotlight moves north from Florida to the grand stage of the national capital and the Supreme Court itself.</p> <p>So far, apart from the infamous case of the Miami-Dade board, barely a single 'neutral' official in Florida has defied party affiliation - not the Republicans nor Democrats on the county canvassing commissions, not Katherine Harris, not the Florida legislature, not even the judges of the Florida Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Democrats. Cynics have come to believe that the single lesson to be learnt from this drama is that politics is above the law, rather than vice-versa.</p> <p>If such party-predictable logic were to apply to the highest authority, Bush would hold the advantage - but only just.</p> <p>The present court, headed by the conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist, is the most narrowly divided for decades. The court has a history as a bastion of the Right, but two appointments by Clinton turned it into a closely balanced scale which the slightest weight can tip decisively to right or left - which is, incidentally, exactly what both Bush and Gore intend to do, in opposite directions, on assuming office.</p> <p>Although the court is made up of seven judges nominated by Republican Presidents, and only two by Clinton, its decisions on major issues over the past two Presidential terms have invariably been settled 5-4, occasionally 6-3, with Clinton's judges, Stephen Beyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cancelling out the ultra-conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who consistently take a hard right-wing line (Bush has consistently praised both of them).</p> <p>In between are moderate Republicans and Justice Sandra O'Connor, a 'floating' independent. And, by next weekend, she could be the latest in the now long line of people deemed to 'hold the Presidency in their hands'.</p> <p>Above Judge O'Connor and her colleagues, however, there is no terrestrial authority to which either side can appeal.</p>",

It makes a perfect soundtrack to another week of ferocious tug of war in the epic election that refuses to end. But while the times in Florida are a-changing, with a frantic see-saw motion between the camps of Al Gore and George Bush, a deeper tide rips beneath the ebb and flow of litigation and ballot counts. It is an undercurrent of political acrimony and ideological vitriol ready to engulf all of America, as supporters of Bush and Gore prepare to turn the next four years of American politics into a scorched terrain of political warfare. At the end of a week of court orders and counter-orders, challenges and counter-challenges, recounts and counter-counts, Bush is poised (again) to claim victory and the US presidency at 5pm today, while Gore is resolved to challenge any such declaration. In case things do not go his way as the deadline for re-counting ballots passes, Bush has secured a hearing next Friday before the highest authority in the land, the US Supreme Court, aiming to overturn all the recounts which snatched the moment of victory claimed for him in Florida at the start of last week. It is the first time in history that the court - guardian of no less than the US Constitution itself - will have been asked to adjudicate on the Presidency; and it is astonishing that the court, which usually deliberates at a snail's pace on America's equivalent of the Ten Commandments, should decide to move and claim jurisdiction on such a fast track. And by way of an added complication, a new player burst onto the scene on Friday night, further muddying the putrid waters between politics and the law: the Republican speaker of the Florida state legislature, Tom Feeney, said the House would join Governor Bush in his appeal to the US Supreme Court.

With Bush's lead down to around 700 and Palm Beach still counting, Gore's hopes have taken another hike, on borrowed time, as the counts move towards the deadline of 5pm today. But whichever way the result finally goes it will be, in Winston Churchill's phrase, no more than 'the end of the beginning'. The casting of votes by the Electoral College next month, and the pomp of the inauguration of either man next January, cannot but be tainted, not only by the events that brought it about, but by the prospect of four years of a Presidency faced by a bare-knuckled opposition bent on subverting what is already being called a coup d'\u00e9tat. One thing is for sure: if the manual recount had gone ahead in the Democrat megalopolis of Miami-Dade, rather than being stopped by the county canvassing board, which said it could not meet today's deadline, Gore would by now be preparing to move offices in the White House, with no thought of moving out. The decision by the board, made up of Democrat Lawrence King and two Democrat-leaning independents, yet again snatched victory from Gore's grasp and was the first, and for the Democrats baffling, defiance of party affiliation in the entire saga. The circumstance led to allegations that the body was intimidated by Republican pressure - from crowds storming the corridors of the civic building and from Florida's heavy-handed Republican Secretary of State, Katherine Harris. Republican militants have been mobilised into rowdy demonstrations which, say the Democrats, have intimidated local authorities with what the aspirant Democrat Vice-President, Joe Lieberman, on Friday night called 'the rule of the mob'. Senator Lieberman accused 'public relations' organisations under the direct authority of the Republican Party of orchestrating the demonstrations, and challenged the party to call them off. Local Democratic representative Peter Deutsch called them a 'paid mob trying to disrupt the result of a fair democratic ballot'. The Republican Party said simply that its mobile rent-a-crowd, which bussed its way from Miami to Broward County on Friday, was made up of angry counting monitors and 'the new face of the Republican Party'. But away from the Florida limelight, in Washington DC, there were stirrings last week that seemed to justify the ire of both Lieberman and Deutsch; signs that the mobs in Florida are the shape of things to come, and visible preparations for a rebellion against an embryonic Gore presidency which would make the conspiracies mounted against Bill Clinton look like a schoolyard game. From the conservative think-tanks to talk radio and the Wall Street Journal, there was a roar of anger from names familiar from the days of the impeachment scandal, who are now coming forward with language they refrained from using even against their betes noires , Bill and Hillary Clinton. One of the ring-leaders of America's conservative Right, former Education Secretary William Bennett, threatened that the election would be 'illegitimate' if it were won by Gore, whom he accused of 'trying to steal this election... This may be the worst thing I have ever seen'. His sentiment was echoed by columnists and activists who propelled the impeachment of President Clinton: Peggy Noonan, grande dame of the anti-Clinton hard Right, also accused Gore, in the Wall Street Journal , of 'stealing the election'. The conservative George Will accused the Vice-President of 'slow-motion larceny', and of harbouring a 'corrupting hunger for power'. The pressure groups and publications that built the groundswell for impeachment are back in action: the rhetoric of talk show host Rush Limbaugh has gone into overdrive, and Grover Norquist, leader of the right-wing Americans for Tax Reform, said Gore's team had 'lost the democratic branches of government; they know that in a fair fight they will lose the Presidency, and they are retreating to the redoubt of trial lawyers and politicised judges'. The Bush legal team is led by Theodore Olson, the Washington lawyer who, as chairman of the ultra-right-wing American Spectator magazine, chaired the meeting that first launched the Troopergate scandal and the Paula Jones lawsuit against Clinton which culminated in the Lewinsky and impeachment dramas. Thomas Mann, of the independent Brookings Institution think-tank, said the level of vitriol from conservatives had reached 'the worst of what we saw during the impeachment fervour - unbridled, self-righteous defiance and venom, bordering on McCarthyism, with accusations of traitorous behaviour'. At the same time, the Gore camp was preparing its end-game strategy and assembling the echelons for all-out war against a Bush administration it would claim had failed to win the election, and clung to a bogus victory through 'mob rule' and deploying partisan election officials in Florida. There are dire warnings from Capitol Hill, where the Senate is divided 50-50 and the lower House is controlled only precariously by the Republicans, that for Gore to continue down the apparently endless legal track will make bipartisan politics impossible within a riven legislature. Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey said openly that he thought it 'very unlikely' that Gore could amass the necessary votes, and said it was a 'political risk' to continue to contest the declared results. But campaign manager Bill Daly and the steel core of the campaign, Lieberman, are digging in on a 'no surrender' stance. Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said this was 'hardly a time to fold', insisting he remained 'extremely optimistic' about the final tally. Ronald Klain, Gore's senior legal adviser, has pledged to challenge the returns to date from Miami-Dade county, saying that they 'fail to reflect a full, fair and accurate tally of the votes'. Apart from fury at the influx of Republican mobs, Democrat ire has been directed against the figure of Harris. Gore's lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, calls the Secretary of State 'a crook and an operative', while Paul Begala, Svengali behind the Gore campaign, daubed her 'a dilettante, debutante Republican hack'. If there is no President by tomorrow night, the spotlight moves north from Florida to the grand stage of the national capital and the Supreme Court itself. So far, apart from the infamous case of the Miami-Dade board, barely a single 'neutral' official in Florida has defied party affiliation - not the Republicans nor Democrats on the county canvassing commissions, not Katherine Harris, not the Florida legislature, not even the judges of the Florida Supreme Court, six of whom were appointed by Democrats. Cynics have come to believe that the single lesson to be learnt from this drama is that politics is above the law, rather than vice-versa. If such party-predictable logic were to apply to the highest authority, Bush would hold the advantage - but only just. The present court, headed by the conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist, is the most narrowly divided for decades. The court has a history as a bastion of the Right, but two appointments by Clinton turned it into a closely balanced scale which the slightest weight can tip decisively to right or left - which is, incidentally, exactly what both Bush and Gore intend to do, in opposite directions, on assuming office. Although the court is made up of seven judges nominated by Republican Presidents, and only two by Clinton, its decisions on major issues over the past two Presidential terms have invariably been settled 5-4, occasionally 6-3, with Clinton's judges, Stephen Beyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, cancelling out the ultra-conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who consistently take a hard right-wing line (Bush has consistently praised both of them). In between are moderate Republicans and Justice Sandra O'Connor, a 'floating' independent. And, by next weekend, she could be the latest in the now long line of people deemed to 'hold the Presidency in their hands'. Above Judge O'Connor and her colleagues, however, there is no terrestrial authority to which either side can appeal.",

Bush the Second won't mind being gridlocked; it's the bespoke excuse to take longer naps. If the President is going to be lame, then it helps to be the guy who will take that lying down, snoozing.</p> <p>Dubya's other edge is that the Republicans hate Al Gore much more than the Democrats love the Vice-President. While the Right is ferociously hungry to reoccupy the White House, there's a jaded appetite for the throne among Democrats. Many of them are saying, more or less openly, that a period in opposition will be cleansing after the morally stained ambiguities of the Clinton chapter. They surmise that a Dubya presidency will actually be good for Democrats, so long as they are not Democrats called Gore. It would virtually guarantee that they will make large gains in the Congressional elections in two years time, and make it more likely that they will capture the White House in 2004.</p> <p>You will note the absence from this Machiavellian calculation of a care for what Republicans might in the meantime try to do to the people for whom the Democrats claim to care. It is this sort of politics-by-numbers that has brought America to its present nadir. No one ever thought that the insufferable Gore or the ineffable Bush possessed faces that were candidates for being carved on Mount Rushmore. No one ever mistook either man for a Washington, a Lincoln or an FDR. Neither has ever hinted at being more than an average occupant of the Oval Office.

For Europeans, a disengaging United States may actually turn out to be the beneficial spur we need to take proper responsibility for our own continent. The European rapid reaction force may come to be seen as a farsighted preparation for the encroaching day when the Yanks fold their tents.

      "body": "<p>Since the Good Friday Agreement a Sinn Fein strategy has been to portray the settlement as a stepping stone towards a united Ireland. The Provisionals' spokesmen have set off green flares aimed at deflecting the republican base from zeroing in on the partitionist core of the 1998 historic compromise. As the republican movement marched en masse towards the Stormont parliament they once vowed to smash, their generals shrouded the political battlefield in emerald mists, convincing foot soldiers they were about to plant the Tricolour in triumph over unionist trenches.</p> <p>Now the fog that descended over the political landscape is clearing. That Sinn Fein are using the courts to try to overturn David Trimble's ban on republicans attending North/South Ministerial Council meetings indicates their concern that a central truth about the agreement is finally exposed. Trimble's ban on Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun is evidence that the unionist veto is alive and well. The First Minister's ability to bar Sinn Fein Ministers from what republicans regard as the crucial aspect of the agreement has rekindled suspicions that the accord has underpinned partition and the unionist consent principle. Combined with Mandelson's ruling that the Union Flag must fly over McGuinness's and de Brun's departments, Trimble's action marks a significant victory for pro-agreement unionism.</p> <p>Nationalists might protest that the agreement belongs to everyone but at its heart Good Friday signified a major compromise. The Irish government dropped the territorial claim and Sinn Fein agreed to enter a partitionist parliament.

      "bodyText": "Since the Good Friday Agreement a Sinn Fein strategy has been to portray the settlement as a stepping stone towards a united Ireland. The Provisionals' spokesmen have set off green flares aimed at deflecting the republican base from zeroing in on the partitionist core of the 1998 historic compromise. As the republican movement marched en masse towards the Stormont parliament they once vowed to smash, their generals shrouded the political battlefield in emerald mists, convincing foot soldiers they were about to plant the Tricolour in triumph over unionist trenches. Now the fog that descended over the political landscape is clearing. That Sinn Fein are using the courts to try to overturn David Trimble's ban on republicans attending North/South Ministerial Council meetings indicates their concern that a central truth about the agreement is finally exposed. Trimble's ban on Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun is evidence that the unionist veto is alive and well. The First Minister's ability to bar Sinn Fein Ministers from what republicans regard as the crucial aspect of the agreement has rekindled suspicions that the accord has underpinned partition and the unionist consent principle. Combined with Mandelson's ruling that the Union Flag must fly over McGuinness's and de Brun's departments, Trimble's action marks a significant victory for pro-agreement unionism. Nationalists might protest that the agreement belongs to everyone but at its heart Good Friday signified a major compromise. The Irish government dropped the territorial claim and Sinn Fein agreed to enter a partitionist parliament. In essence, the agreement doesn't imply a move towards unity. With the smoke of propaganda fading, Austin Morgan's The Belfast Agreement: a Practical Legal Analysis is dense legalistic prose which, if you bear with it, provides a map to help you through the blur of rhetoric and lies. Morgan, a Derry-born London-based barrister, in a segment on constitutional matters says that 'the constitutional changes brought about by the Belfast Agreement are characterised predominantly by the end of the territorial claim over Northern Ireland' rather than a weakening of the link with the UK.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, Clare Short stood up in the Commons with a reasonable expectation of being asked about the great issues which fill the days of her International Development Department. The bloodbath in the Middle East was topical, as was the war in the Congo, and famine, drought and flood. Yet none of these man-made disasters disturbed Conservative MPs. They wanted to get down to the real business of shouting about sugar.</p> <p>When the conversation was in danger of turning to such trivial matters as whether aid should be given to kleptomaniac dictators, James Paice interrupted with a 'May I take the Right Hon lady back to the issue of sugar?' When the religious war in Sudan, which has cost 1,500,000 lives, was raised, Cheryl Gillan butted in with 'Of the 48 least and less-developed countries, 21 produce sugar, and Sudan has the largest sugar production among them'.</p> <p>A faintly bewildered Short sat down and Tony Blair took the floor to be confronted by another sweet-toothed Tory. John Greenway wasted one of the few opportunities he will get in his career to interrogate the Prime Minister by hitting him with a sugar question. Blair did not quite reply 'Sugar? Come again?' but few would have blamed him if he had.</p> <p>The Conservatives addressed the PM and Short in the concerned, simpering tone of the new Portilloised party. Caribbean islands faced devastation and impoverishment, they warned, and for a moment a cynic could be convinced that they truly cared about the plight of the Third World. It is always worth counting your fingers after a compassionate Conservative has squeezed your hand. In this instance, the reckoning shows that the Conservatives have allied with sugar interests and the most pampered farmers in Europe in an attempt to destroy an initiative to give back to the poorest people on the planet a little of the money we screw from them. They may yet succeed.</p> <p>The World Trade Organisation can now meet only behind regiments of riot police because of the disgust at how the wretched of the Earth are treated. The free trade enforced by the Washington consensus flows in one direction. The poor must open their markets to Western corporations, but the favour is rarely returned.</p> <p>Oxfam estimates that backward countries lose $700 billion (\u00a3460bn) a year because of tariffs and barriers in Europe, North America and Japan. Third World farmers suffer most, not only from the formal charges but from the constraints health faddism brings. The European Union insists that dairy products, for example, must come from cows which have been mechanically milked and thus bans virtually every Indian smallholder from exporting.</p> <p>The WTO has lived up to its reputation for being a protection racket for the wealthy and done nothing. Its failure provoked Pascal Lamy, the European Trade Commissioner, to be generous to the South. The poorest 48 countries, mainly in Africa, should have unrestricted access to EU markets, he decided. There would be no tariffs and no quotas. They would be free to sell any product except arms.</p> <p>As Short herself admits, the largess from Brussels will not change the world. The 600 million people living in the 48 nations have an average annual income of \u00a3191 - or 52 pence a day. Their importing and exporting accounts for a mere 0.4 per cent of world trade. As far as global capitalism is concerned, they might as well be dead - and many soon will be.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Lamy's gesture would at least bring benefits to a few and end the enormous hypocrisy of a 'free' market which becomes very restrictive indeed when the traders and producers have black or brown skins. Unfortunately, he will probably be defeated by the power of the ferocious sugar lobby.</p> <p>There is no reason why Europe needs to grow sugar beet rather than import sugar cane from the Tropics. In the Napoleonic and First and Second World Wars, beet could be presented as a vital resource which would help frustrate a blockade.</p> <p>Any conceivable modern war will either be nuclear and over pretty quickly or a guerrilla conflict which will not close the ports. Yet through production-limiting quotas, minimum prices for farmers and import restrictions, European sugar business continues to demand and receive formidable protection. The prices for consumers and industry are always twice and often three times as high as world prices.</p> <p>Only the Caribbean plantations - built on slavery, the sugar industry's first contribution to a global market - are allowed to export without restriction, hence the Tory predictions of impoverishment and the insistence of the Tate &amp; Lyle press office that journalists should concentrate on the threat to the West Indies. Neither says that Lamy merely wants to accord the poorest countries the same rights as the Caribbean. He is not trying to take West Indian rights away.</p> <p>Anyone who believes that the Conservatives are motivated by altruism should look at who is behind the campaign. The National Farmers Union and British Sugar, the makers of Silver Spoon, are lobbying Parliament hard. The thought of any concession to impoverished countries is intolerable.</p> <p>They won't get anywhere in Britain if Blair stands firm, although I accept that that is always a giant 'if'. But the Tories and the industry are part of a pan-European movement which has a good chance of persuading the EU to forget about Lamy's benevolence, probably with the aid a French or German veto.</p> <p>The Third World and consumers will still be ripped off, but at least the Conservative Party will have re-established its role as clients of the sugar industry. From 1945 onwards, Tate &amp; Lyle was a generous corporate sponsor. In 1996, with the party heading for defeat, the company spread its bets in a tripartisan fashion by funding New Labour and the Liberal Democrats as well as their traditional friends.</p> <p>This year, Michael Portillo rebuilt bridges when he promised to abolish Labour taxes on companies which move money offshore, after Tate &amp; Lyle, among others, had complained of the pain it would suffer from being made to pay its way. Bowen Wells, the Tory chairman of the International Development Committee, was an adviser to Michael Ashcroft, the offshore banker whose donations to the party brought him a peerage. Welles lobbied on Tate &amp; Lyle's behalf. The company enjoyed the indulgent tax benefits offered by Ashcroft's Bank of Belize. Wells joined the assault on Short in the Commons last week.</p> <p>All of which puts Conservative complaints about military cooperation in Europe into perspective. Although the party is always ready to denounce real and imaginary Euromadness, scepticism has its limits. It will fight to the last ditch to defend the most pernicious Europrivileges for its supporters regardless of the consequences for an electorate and an impoverished South which must pay for them.</p> <p>Cardinal Irvine, the Lord High Chancellor of all England, art collector, Blair placeman and millionaire corporate lawyer, cuts a faintly preposterous figure when he poses as a working-class hero.</p> <p>For all his unsuitability for the role, he explains that cuts in legal aid to the poorest as an act of class war against 'fat cat' lawyers on behalf of the oppressed masses rather than an assault on the welfare state. In September he took the cant of pseudo-populism further when he effectively banned defendants without means from being represented by Queen's Counsel, the most distinguished advocates. Even when they are up against a murder charge and a mandatory life sentence, they must now make do with junior barristers.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, Clare Short stood up in the Commons with a reasonable expectation of being asked about the great issues which fill the days of her International Development Department. The bloodbath in the Middle East was topical, as was the war in the Congo, and famine, drought and flood. Yet none of these man-made disasters disturbed Conservative MPs. They wanted to get down to the real business of shouting about sugar. When the conversation was in danger of turning to such trivial matters as whether aid should be given to kleptomaniac dictators, James Paice interrupted with a 'May I take the Right Hon lady back to the issue of sugar?' When the religious war in Sudan, which has cost 1,500,000 lives, was raised, Cheryl Gillan butted in with 'Of the 48 least and less-developed countries, 21 produce sugar, and Sudan has the largest sugar production among them'. A faintly bewildered Short sat down and Tony Blair took the floor to be confronted by another sweet-toothed Tory. John Greenway wasted one of the few opportunities he will get in his career to interrogate the Prime Minister by hitting him with a sugar question. Blair did not quite reply 'Sugar? Come again?' but few would have blamed him if he had. The Conservatives addressed the PM and Short in the concerned, simpering tone of the new Portilloised party. Caribbean islands faced devastation and impoverishment, they warned, and for a moment a cynic could be convinced that they truly cared about the plight of the Third World. It is always worth counting your fingers after a compassionate Conservative has squeezed your hand. In this instance, the reckoning shows that the Conservatives have allied with sugar interests and the most pampered farmers in Europe in an attempt to destroy an initiative to give back to the poorest people on the planet a little of the money we screw from them. They may yet succeed. The World Trade Organisation can now meet only behind regiments of riot police because of the disgust at how the wretched of the Earth are treated. The free trade enforced by the Washington consensus flows in one direction. The poor must open their markets to Western corporations, but the favour is rarely returned. Oxfam estimates that backward countries lose $700 billion (\u00a3460bn) a year because of tariffs and barriers in Europe, North America and Japan. Third World farmers suffer most, not only from the formal charges but from the constraints health faddism brings. The European Union insists that dairy products, for example, must come from cows which have been mechanically milked and thus bans virtually every Indian smallholder from exporting. The WTO has lived up to its reputation for being a protection racket for the wealthy and done nothing. Its failure provoked Pascal Lamy, the European Trade Commissioner, to be generous to the South. The poorest 48 countries, mainly in Africa, should have unrestricted access to EU markets, he decided. There would be no tariffs and no quotas. They would be free to sell any product except arms. As Short herself admits, the largess from Brussels will not change the world. The 600 million people living in the 48 nations have an average annual income of \u00a3191 - or 52 pence a day. Their importing and exporting accounts for a mere 0.4 per cent of world trade. As far as global capitalism is concerned, they might as well be dead - and many soon will be. Nevertheless, Lamy's gesture would at least bring benefits to a few and end the enormous hypocrisy of a 'free' market which becomes very restrictive indeed when the traders and producers have black or brown skins. Unfortunately, he will probably be defeated by the power of the ferocious sugar lobby. There is no reason why Europe needs to grow sugar beet rather than import sugar cane from the Tropics. In the Napoleonic and First and Second World Wars, beet could be presented as a vital resource which would help frustrate a blockade. Any conceivable modern war will either be nuclear and over pretty quickly or a guerrilla conflict which will not close the ports. Yet through production-limiting quotas, minimum prices for farmers and import restrictions, European sugar business continues to demand and receive formidable protection. The prices for consumers and industry are always twice and often three times as high as world prices. Only the Caribbean plantations - built on slavery, the sugar industry's first contribution to a global market - are allowed to export without restriction, hence the Tory predictions of impoverishment and the insistence of the Tate &amp; Lyle press office that journalists should concentrate on the threat to the West Indies. Neither says that Lamy merely wants to accord the poorest countries the same rights as the Caribbean. He is not trying to take West Indian rights away. Anyone who believes that the Conservatives are motivated by altruism should look at who is behind the campaign. The National Farmers Union and British Sugar, the makers of Silver Spoon, are lobbying Parliament hard. The thought of any concession to impoverished countries is intolerable. They won't get anywhere in Britain if Blair stands firm, although I accept that that is always a giant 'if'. But the Tories and the industry are part of a pan-European movement which has a good chance of persuading the EU to forget about Lamy's benevolence, probably with the aid a French or German veto. The Third World and consumers will still be ripped off, but at least the Conservative Party will have re-established its role as clients of the sugar industry. From 1945 onwards, Tate &amp; Lyle was a generous corporate sponsor. In 1996, with the party heading for defeat, the company spread its bets in a tripartisan fashion by funding New Labour and the Liberal Democrats as well as their traditional friends. This year, Michael Portillo rebuilt bridges when he promised to abolish Labour taxes on companies which move money offshore, after Tate &amp; Lyle, among others, had complained of the pain it would suffer from being made to pay its way. Bowen Wells, the Tory chairman of the International Development Committee, was an adviser to Michael Ashcroft, the offshore banker whose donations to the party brought him a peerage. Welles lobbied on Tate &amp; Lyle's behalf. The company enjoyed the indulgent tax benefits offered by Ashcroft's Bank of Belize. Wells joined the assault on Short in the Commons last week. All of which puts Conservative complaints about military cooperation in Europe into perspective. Although the party is always ready to denounce real and imaginary Euromadness, scepticism has its limits. It will fight to the last ditch to defend the most pernicious Europrivileges for its supporters regardless of the consequences for an electorate and an impoverished South which must pay for them. Cardinal Irvine, the Lord High Chancellor of all England, art collector, Blair placeman and millionaire corporate lawyer, cuts a faintly preposterous figure when he poses as a working-class hero. For all his unsuitability for the role, he explains that cuts in legal aid to the poorest as an act of class war against 'fat cat' lawyers on behalf of the oppressed masses rather than an assault on the welfare state. In September he took the cant of pseudo-populism further when he effectively banned defendants without means from being represented by Queen's Counsel, the most distinguished advocates. Even when they are up against a murder charge and a mandatory life sentence, they must now make do with junior barristers. Once again, meanness was justified as a legitimate defence against the greed of grasping lawyers. As I noted the other week, Irvine was denying QCs to the swinish multitude while using public money to hire a QC to defend his reputation. What I did not realise was how much money was being spent on saving His Eminence's face. Irvine is appealing against an employment tribunal ruling that he was guilty of indirect sex discrimination when he appointed Garry Hart as his special adviser. Hart, who worked for the enormously expensive City law firm, Herbert Smith, would push large briefs in Irvine's direction, when the Lord Chancellor was one of the fattest felines at the Bar. Hart is the godfather of the PM's daughter and, what with one thing and another, you can see why the Lord Chancellor was fond of him. To overturn the tribunal's impertinent rulings that unadvertised jobs and secret appointments guarantee discrimination, Irvine has hired Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, one of the best lawyers in London. Sir Sydney costs \u00a3500 an hour (135 times the minimum wage). If he is working long hours, he offers a discount. You can book his services from dawn to dusk and beyond for a mere \u00a35,000 a day. Sir Sydney will be assisted by Richard McManus QC, who charges a paltry \u00a3250 an hour. Just as one Jag is not enough for Prescott, one QC is not enough for Irvine - although it is one too many for the poor.",

The columnist was about to make political history.</p> <p>He wrote: 'When General Sir Charles Guthrie was made Chief of the Defence Staff three years ago, no one would have predicted that he would preside over the greatest political defeat inflicted on our armed forces this century.

Tony Blair, who had been briefed about the article by Alastair Campbell, his official spokesman, was furious. The Mail had perpetrated an injustice.

      "bodyText": "The US Supreme Court, under Chief Justice William Rehnquist turned down Bush's argument that manual recounts violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection, due process and freedom of political association. Instead it agreed to determine two tighter questions and added one of its own. All three concern the interaction between the Florida Supreme Court's decision last Tuesday to allow recounts and a state legislature's rights under the Constitution and federal law. Bush's lawyers argue that by letting recounts go on beyond a seven-day deadline specified in a state code, the Florida Supreme Court rewrote state law and disregarded federal law. A section of the US code governing elections says a state's laws enacted before election day 'shall be conclusive, and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes'. Bush's team argues that by setting 26 November instead of 14 November for certification, the state supreme court set new rules. Gore's lawyers argue that it simply carried out an 'ordinary act' of interpreting a statute. The US Supreme Court also agreed to decide whether the state court's ruling was inconsistent with a clause in the federal constitution which allots to each state the duty of choosing electors for the Electoral College 'in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct'. By taking up this question the court is breaking a tradition by stepping into a struggle between two branches of state government. The question the court has added is 'what would be the consequences' of finding that the Florida court's decision did not comply with the US code? In other words, what would be the remedy?",

It was an act of extraordinary chutzpah for a man who, facing a popular revolt less than two months before, wanted to send tanks on to the streets of Belgrade to maintain his power after election defeat. But the former Yugoslav President was neither penitent not reformed. In a blistering anti-Western speech, he blasted the new government, describing its actions in gaining power as an on-going war. 'We all know what kind of violence and lawlessness took place after the 5 October coup,' Milosevic told the 2,300 Socialist Party delegates. 'The war which is being conducted against this country is now being conducted with money,' Milosevic said.

The former President was defeated on 24 September in local, federal and presidential elections, but he refused to accept the results until an uprising in Belgrade on 5 October saw the police and the army side with the protesters, after which he stood down. His congress speech laid into the new government for agreeing to co-operate with the United Nations war crimes tribunal. He said the new government was full of 'traitors' who want to hand over 'national heroes' to 'the new Gestapo'. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav police and an Albanian guerrilla group have signed a ceasefire on Serbia's boundary with Kosovo after a week of intense fighting in which at least three people died. The truce was signed amid increased tension within Kosovo, where senior UN officials fear that a wave of violent attacks may have ended ethnic Albanians' hopes of independence by alienating world opinion.

A spokesman for the Nato-led K-For peacekeeping force in Kosovo said the Liberation Army for Preshevo, Buj-anovac and Mevedja (UCPMB), an off-shoot of the Kosovo Liberation Army, had signed the ceasefire last Friday evening.

Carlos Criado-Perez joined the group in August 1999 and took over as chief executive three months later. </p> <p>The group was struggling. Safeway 2000, its strategy of focusing on families and store revamps, was failing. Sales growth was fading away and profits were falling. In short, it had lost its way. </p> <p>After just one year under Criado-Perez's leadership, it has regained its confidence - and with good reason. Sales have been rising for 15 months, starting almost as soon as he walked in the door. </p> <p>In the six months to 14 October the rise, excluding new space, was 5 per cent. Profits over the same period rose by 10 per cent and Safeway claims to have attracted 1 million new customers. </p> <p>Now ask the question again: what difference does a chief executive make? Not much, judging by the performance of Sainsbury. Sir Peter Davis took over as chief executive in March when the group was struggling. A series of management changes - including the appointment of the first chief executive from outside the Sainsbury family - had failed to give it direction. Sales growth was fading away and profits were falling. In short, it had lost its way. </p> <p>After nine months of Sir Peter's leadership, little has changed. Sales in the first six months of its financial year rose by just 0.7 per cent, excluding petrol and new space, below the average for food retailers. Underlying profits fell by 17 per cent and it appears still to be losing customers. </p> <p>To be fair to Sir Peter, he has been in the job just half as long as Criado-Perez so it is too early to compare performance - particularly when Sir Peter has made it clear that his recovery programme will take three years. But Safeway's very success underlines the difficulty he faces. </p> <p>Criado-Perez came from Wal-Mart, and his experience there persuaded him that everyday low pricing, the strategy pursued by the US giant and by most of the British supermarket groups, would not work for a small player like Safeway. Its larger rivals could too easily undercut it. </p> <p>Instead, he decided to use what he calls a high/low strategy, what we know as loss-leading. The technique is familiar - cut the price of 20 or so selected items each week. The radical part came in the implementation. </p> <p>Instead of making it a national campaign, which would allow its rivals to instantly follow its price cuts, Safeway's 'best deals ever' vary from town to town and change every week. It employs 5,500 people to distribute the leaflets - one home in every three gets one. The price cuts are dramatic -half-price chickens, 40 per cent off family-sized Coca Cola - indeed, many are sold at below the cost to Safeway. </p> <p>Shoppers seem to love it, as is evident from Safeway's sales. But it is high risk - sales have to increase by enough to limit the impact on profits, and it has to be able to deliver the stock. </p> <p>That is harder than it sounds. Some of the products on offer fly out of the door. Finance director Simon Laffin, who has been seeing the demand at first-hand with a three-month stint as manager of the Wokingham store, says some sell as much in a week as they normally would in a year. Organising stock levels for that kind of demand, on different products around the country, is a logistical nightmare. </p> <p>That is one of the reasons why rivals have not emulated Safeway's strategy, despite its success. Tesco, as the dominant player, does not need to. Asda is wedded to the every-day low pricing strategy of its parent Wal-Mart, and Sainsbury's centralised distribution systems would make it difficult. Sainsbury would also have to drop its loyalty card, something Davis seems reluctant to do. </p> <p>Instead, he seems to be promising more of the same, but executed better and faster. Sainsbury will not go out and out to compete with Tesco and Asda on price but will instead focus on its traditional strengths of service and quality. </p> <p>So it is investing in new product development ('taste the difference') refurbishing stores and removing 'inappropriate' products like televisions from its shelves. Davis is also doing the traditional new-broom thing of cutting costs - a \u00a3600 million cut is promised by the end of the three-year programme. Added to what Davis hopes to be accelerating sales growth, that should get Sainsbury's margins back to the level of Tesco and the other leaders -roughly 6 per cent at the moment. </p> <p>There is no doubt that Sainsbury is less efficient than its rivals, although the scale of the promised savings surprised some observers. But analysts doubt whether Sainsbury can keep all those savings for itself and expect that at least some of the \u00a3600m will have to be given back to customers in price cuts. </p> <p>Davis has other headaches too. The Homebase disposal is taking longer than expected, sales at its US business went into reverse and its Egyptian business (why Egypt, Davis must be asking) is proving a financial disaster. It is confident that the US problem is a short-term blip, caused by integrating a recent acquisition. All the more worrying, then, that it is adding yet more stores there with the acquisition of the Grand Union chain. </p> <p>Safeway's strategy may be winning customers but it is Sainsbury that has won over the City. While Safeway shares have had a good run, they still stand at a 20 per cent discount to Sainsbury, based on analysts' estimates of profits for the full year. </p> <p>Safeway has just passed the first anniversary of its promotional campaign so it will be more and more difficult to keep sales rising. But it is working hard to keep the momentum going with store refurbishments, improvements in product availability and a renewed focus on fresh products. </p> <p>Sainsbury has been mismanaged for years so there is much to go for if someone finally manages to get the formula right. However, there is little sign that Davis has done that so far, while Safeway grows more confident by the day. Follow the lead of the Safeway shoppers and bag yourself a bargain.</p>",

However, there is little sign that Davis has done that so far, while Safeway grows more confident by the day. Follow the lead of the Safeway shoppers and bag yourself a bargain.",

The Dublin authorities are accused of failing to challenge anti-British prejudice, which, the authors claim, continues to alienate unionists from the southern state. The 67-page report, drawn up by 16 different southern Irish peace and reconciliation groups, accuses institutions such as the Catholic Church and the Gaelic Athletic Association of promoting a one-sided, 'rigidly nationalist mindset'. Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin are understood to be furious about the report, which they believe will confirm unionists' fears of being subsumed into a Catholic and nationalist-dominated Ireland. The study, to be published next month by the southern -based Irish Peace and Reconciliation Platform, cites a large number of issues on which it saysthe Republic has failed to live up to the ideals of the Agreement. It concludes that there is: \u0095 Exclusion of people from the unionist tradition. \u0095 A tendency to avoid the concerns of both sides in Northern Ireland. \u0095 A fault in school curricula so serious that children can complete their entire education without properly learning the history, culture and beliefs of any tradition or religion but their own. \u0095 A fostering of selective cultural and historical amnesia, such as allowing whole swathes of people to be 'airbrushed' out of history if their 'faces didn't fit'. These include Irish people who fought on the British side in the world wars, and a mistaken belief that only Catholics suffered in the nineteenth century famines. \u0095 An under-emphasis in the media of the integrity of the unionist position and the por trayal of people of that tradition in over-simplified terms. Overall, the authors note that since 1922 there has been 'little attempt to address the fears and apprehensions of unionists in the context of possible new political dispensations'. They say anti-British attitudes have helped 'restrict the creation of trust-building with the unionist community' in Northern Ireland. John Taylor, the deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said he was not surprised by the findings, which portrayed the position of the Irish state since partition. 'Even though the Irish government recognised the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK when they signed the agreement, the state broadcaster, RTE, still refers to Northern Ireland as the \"North\" rather than its proper name. Even RTE is required to be re-educated in parity of esteem,' Taylor said. But he believed the problem was 'bound to improve, especially since there has been an increase in the numbers of Irish citizens applying for British passports from the UK embassy in Dublin'.

Shortly afterwards Svend Auken, head of the Danish delegation, emerged. The climate convention had begun to disintegrate. </p> <p>The cleaners started to sweep away the debris and to prepare for the next conference, a meeting of oil industry specialists. </p> <p>Only a few hours earlier, an ebullient Prescott and an equally enthusiastic Environment Minister Michael Meacher had briefed reporters that the pair were close to brokering a deal between the US and the European Union, the two major opponents in the talks. </p> <p>Meacher and Prescott had entered the final phase of negotiations late on Friday and were prepared, with other delegates, to sit up all night to hammer out a plausible deal. These negotiations centred on a basic ideological division. On one side stood an umbrella group - led by the United States - that included New Zealand, Australia and Japan. On the other stood the European Union nations and the developing world. </p> <p>The US camp had come to The Hague seeking to avoid cuts in carbon dioxide emissions from cars and factories. Instead they wanted to fund carbon sinks - forests and plants that absorb carbon dioxide - as a substitute for halting their profligacy with petrol and their factories' energy inefficiency. </p> <p>By paying for the growing of new plantations in developing nations and by demanding that greater allowance be made for their own forests, these countries - particularly the United States - hoped to avoid cutting their own emissions. </p> <p>Europe was committed to the idea that the developed world had to reduce its burning of fossil fuels and considered the American carbon sink plan as a bid to avoid global responsibilities. Who would be responsible for such plantations, asked European delegates? What would happen when they died off? And would they be made of giant monoculture plantations of endless rows of pines and eucalyptus trees that would devastate local wildlife? They received few satisfactory answers. </p> <p>The deadlock held until 3am yesterday, when Prescott decided to take action. He persuaded US delegates that if they abandoned their attempts to fund carbon sink forests in developing nations, European delegates would be more sympathetic to America's arguments that its own carbon sinks, both its forests and its agriculture land, would be given greater importance in negotiations. </p> <p>John Loy, head of the US delegation, agreed - and so Meacher and Prescott called in the media to announce their plan. 'We have put this to the European Union delegation, and they asked for more information,' said Prescott. The deal looked good, in other words, a view that was later shared by Jan Pronk, the conference president who was responsible for all negotiations. 'At six o'clock this morning it looked too close to call,' he said. There was everything still to play for.' </p> <p>Prescott then called a meeting of his fellow European delegates in the expectation of success. It was to be a disillusioning experience. Europe's delegates were led by the formidable Dominique Voynet from France, and by the equally committed J\u00fcrgen Tritten, from Germany. Both are Green Party members and view with extreme suspicion the antics of the US delegation. </p> <p>Why should the US have special exemptions and be allowed to reduce its cutback quota just because it is a rich and powerful country, they asked? One by one delegates voted down the Prescott plan. </p> <p>This rejection might not have been so bad if European delegates had then offered a negotiating response. But time was running out and Pronk called a halt just after 11am. 'It was incredibly frustrating,' said Meacher later on. 'We were that close to a deal in there.' </p> <p>A few minutes later Prescott walked from the building, with stunned members of the world's media trailing in his wake. 'The talks are finished, there is no deal,' he announced, before heading to Amsterdam airport. </p> <p>It was a grim experience for the ebullient Prescott. He had pinned great hopes on his ability to persuade the two sides to agree, but failed - mainly because he had, naively, underestimated European hostilities to the Americans and to the belligerent negotiating of the US team. As a result he had been made to look ridiculous as he stormed from the conference, furious at his treatment by his fellow European delegates. It had been a chastening visit. </p> <p>His failure and that of the other delegates raises a critical question, however. Can a global climate deal ever be negotiated? To judge from events, the answer is not encouraging. The US has consistently treated these negotiations as just another round of trade talks. The US - whose citizens account for 4 per cent of the world's population and 24 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions - will have to reduce its carbon output by 650 million tonnes by 2010 if it is to meet its Kyoto obligations, about a third of its current output. </p> <p>From the start of these talks the US team attempted to find any way it could to reduce this amount. It was simply a haggle for a bargain. </p> <p>But Europe could see no justification for giving America any deal over carbon sinks. After all, no other developed nation was to be given one. It was a matter of principle, of climatic importance - an attitude that has defined Europe's but not America's position. </p> <p>In the end, it was this difference in ideology that so fatally damaged last week's talks and that has now left the world's hopes of a deal over climate control, and of saving the planet from catastrophe, in tatters. </p> <p><strong>Can plantations save the Earth?</strong></p> <p>Establishing plantations of young trees is one way of creating a 'carbon sink' as part of attempts to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rather than contribute to it. America wanted to include a large contribution of sinks in the total, so that it would not have to reduce the amount of fossil fuels that it was burning. In other words, it wanted to grow trees rather than cut down on car use. </p> <p>Environmentalists are opposed to carbon sinks because there are huge uncertainties about the amount of carbon that forests really absorb. Also a plantation of fast-growing pine trees absorbs far more carbon dioxide than a mature forest. That would mean that including forests in the total would encourage countries to cut down old forests such as rainforests and replace them with monoculture plantations. </p> <p>Europe was opposed to the American proposal on carbon sinks because the Americans wanted to be allowed to claim credit for so much carbon being absorbed by its forests, that it would have allowed them to increase their emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 per cent rather than cutting them by 7 per cent as they had promised under Kyoto. If this formula were accepted, it would have meant that Sweden and Finland would be allowed to increase their fossil fuel emissions by up to 40 per cent. European countries were opposed to this because it would have undone the hard-won agreement at Kyoto to cut the emission of greenhouse gases. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.unfccc.int\">UN framework convention on climate change</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unfccc.de/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html\">Full text of the Kyoto Protocol</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/climatechange\">DETR climate change programme</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk\">University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit</a></p>",

In response, the Republican Party mounted a campaign of tumult across Florida's scorched political earth yesterday, as a mob of demonstrators accused of shutting down a recount in Miami that could have won the election for Gore was bused up to Fort Lauderdale, hoping to stifle and stop the count in Broward County. The demonstrations were joined by a phalanx of Republican heavy-hitters, brought in from elsewhere in the US to object to the counting methods and join a local attempt to stop the count by a Republican lawyer alleging a conflict of interests on the canvassing board. Projections from Palm Beach and Broward counties, both counting frantically yesterday, showed Gore on course for a shortfall of only 90 votes from Bush's originally certified win by 930 ballots. Bush is set to be declared the winner of the Florida election and thereby the US Presidency this afternoon - but by his side only. The hit squad of politicians included Marc Racoicot, Governor of Montana - who said of the Broward board: 'They are not counting votes, they are casting votes' - along with New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman and the Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating. As allegations of Republican intimidation fly, the party insists the demonstrations are by local supporters of Bush. However, The Observer has identified a number of faces that appear and re-appear at protests as being senior and hardline party operatives dispatched from Washington. They include an official from the office of the Republican chief whip on Capitol Hill, Tom Delay, and a Republican lobbyist working for the big pharmaceutical and insurance companies. The certification of the result will be sent to the office of the Secretary of State for Florida - the hardline partisan Republican Katherine Harris - who will proclaim that Bush has won the state's 25 electoral college votes and with them the White House. But today's moment of hollow triumph is by no means the end; the certification is a mere gesture in to the maelstrom of litigation and political battle. Both sides have said they are prepared to contest the result past today's deadline, and the certification itself will be challenged by Gore. The US Supreme Court will convene on Friday to determine the constitutional and federal legality of recounts across Florida. Its intervention, which has surprised some constitutional lawyers, could determine the presidency.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has shown some unaccustomed steel. Last week, he advocated the elimination of poverty, the lifting of public investment and the improvement of public services. He honoured teachers and others dedicated to public service. He scorned Thatcherism's evident weaknesses. He spoke articulately for Europe, and thus for Britain's interests. And he dared to criticise the pantomime euro-scepticism of the right-wing press.</p> <p>The Prime Minister began, above all, to sound a little like a leader with a mission and a set of principles. About time, too.</p> <p>We have now reached a critical point in the politics of the new century. Labour is beginning its campaign to win a general election that realistically offers the party the historic chance of a second full term in government. The challenge for the Labour Party is to reignite the enthusiasm with which it was elected in 1997, but the party must still address the enormous gaps in its appeal to many voters.</p> <p>It has to engage those who voted for 'New Labour' last time purely because of their misgivings about the return of a fifth Conservative government. It also has to reassure the many constituencies which have been left bitterly disappointed by Labour after more than three years in power. At the same time, Labour must rebuff a populist Tory party more willing than ever to play dirty in its quest for victory. The lesson of last week is that it can be done. Now Mr Blair needs to convince us that he is confident enough in the values of the centre and centre-Left to cede no more ground to the Right - and even to win some back.</p> <p>When the election comes, Labour will proudly claim a scale of jobs growth and of individual prosperity coupled with low inflation and high investment not witnessed since the war. Additionally, there is an expansion of investment in education, transport and health that requires a long-term platform and which the country desperately needs. The party will be right to boast about its record and it plans.</p> <p>Where Labour has been on much less secure ground is in the way it has chosen to respond to William Hague's populist opportunism. Home Secretary Jack Straw and others have been correct to stress that it is natural Labour supporters, particularly those living in large, inner-city estates who suffer most from crime - and that noisy neighbours or gangs of rampaging youths or local drug dealers are social problems that require tough responses. Liberal critics, out of touch with these realities, readily dismiss the solutions as illiberal authoritarianism. But as the leaked memos of Philip Gould and Cabinet papers have both underlined, Labour's preoccupations go much further than that. The Prime Minister has shown himself too often wanting to outflank William Hague, leading Labour to positions on asylum-seekers, sentencing policy and jury trial that are hard to defend by any standards, let alone those of a progressive political party.</p> <p>Number 10 has put immense pressure on Jack Straw to toughen up Labour's act still further, so that from the decriminalisation of soft drugs to penal policy, Labour's position is barely distinguishable from that of the Tories. The calculation is that this leaves Hague little populist opportunity, but the stupidity is that it confers on him something more priceless - legitimacy and the ability to set the political agenda. Straw and his team need to steer a more careful course both in terms of principle and political advantage. The Prime Minister has taken a principled position on Europe; now he should take the same stance on civil liberties.</p> <p>Labour's position will be much easier if it develops - and boasts of - some first principles. Strong defence and freedom of information might appear to be disparate policies appealing to different voters. They are not. The most appropriate military protection comes with the best public scrutiny, Ministers should be able to argue. Similarly, reducing class sizes and getting rid of the notorious Section 28 can be wrongly characterised as appealing to diverse groups of electors. But both are about providing the best, most honest and appropriate education for Britain's young people in the twenty-first century. In order to champion a catalogue of policies like these - instead of fighting local skirmishes over and over again - Labour needs to adopt a coherent and convincing radical narrative.</p> <p>For Number 10's cautious advisers, this may seem a risk too far. New Labour has already opened up one flank by taking on the Eurosceptics over the so-called 'European army' last week; to adopt a broadly liberal approach on welfare, crime and race may seem to offer William Hague too much political leeway. Mr Blair should be reassured. Failing to argue a position or pretending to be something you are not explode all too easily in your face, as he should learn from the story of the European rapid reaction force. At first, Labour tried to smuggle the commitment through. Then it stressed what the force was not. It was only latterly that it went on the offensive arguing the case on its merits. And they are demonstrable, particularly at a time when George Bush, Mr Hague's American pal, is flirting overtly with isolationism.</p> <p>Labour needs the nerve to acknowledge that for all the sound and fury of last week's row over the 'European army', the Conservatives have yet to build political momentum. Of course that is still possible. The Tories are still - disgracefully - praying for an explosion of civil unrest before the next general election just as they privately welcomed the fuel tax disorders earlier this year. But so far, William Hague has achieved no more than to rebuild his coalition on the Right - the odd caravan of euro-sceptics, hard-faced business people, bloodsports campaigners and petrol protesters marching alongside diehard members of the Tory tribe. While it is loud, even hysterical, its appeal is narrow and unable to reach for the political centre.</p> <p>Mr Blair would be right to assert his principles. His most significant risk is still that he allows the Conservatives to set the political agenda - always the first step to winning the political argument and then elections. He should always remember that the Right is increasingly desperate and, an important lesson for Labour, no concession is or will be good enough for the right-wing press. Whatever he says or does, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph will cavil.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has shown some unaccustomed steel. Last week, he advocated the elimination of poverty, the lifting of public investment and the improvement of public services. He honoured teachers and others dedicated to public service. He scorned Thatcherism's evident weaknesses. He spoke articulately for Europe, and thus for Britain's interests. And he dared to criticise the pantomime euro-scepticism of the right-wing press. The Prime Minister began, above all, to sound a little like a leader with a mission and a set of principles. About time, too. We have now reached a critical point in the politics of the new century. Labour is beginning its campaign to win a general election that realistically offers the party the historic chance of a second full term in government. The challenge for the Labour Party is to reignite the enthusiasm with which it was elected in 1997, but the party must still address the enormous gaps in its appeal to many voters. It has to engage those who voted for 'New Labour' last time purely because of their misgivings about the return of a fifth Conservative government. It also has to reassure the many constituencies which have been left bitterly disappointed by Labour after more than three years in power. At the same time, Labour must rebuff a populist Tory party more willing than ever to play dirty in its quest for victory. The lesson of last week is that it can be done. Now Mr Blair needs to convince us that he is confident enough in the values of the centre and centre-Left to cede no more ground to the Right - and even to win some back. When the election comes, Labour will proudly claim a scale of jobs growth and of individual prosperity coupled with low inflation and high investment not witnessed since the war. Additionally, there is an expansion of investment in education, transport and health that requires a long-term platform and which the country desperately needs. The party will be right to boast about its record and it plans. Where Labour has been on much less secure ground is in the way it has chosen to respond to William Hague's populist opportunism. Home Secretary Jack Straw and others have been correct to stress that it is natural Labour supporters, particularly those living in large, inner-city estates who suffer most from crime - and that noisy neighbours or gangs of rampaging youths or local drug dealers are social problems that require tough responses. Liberal critics, out of touch with these realities, readily dismiss the solutions as illiberal authoritarianism. But as the leaked memos of Philip Gould and Cabinet papers have both underlined, Labour's preoccupations go much further than that. The Prime Minister has shown himself too often wanting to outflank William Hague, leading Labour to positions on asylum-seekers, sentencing policy and jury trial that are hard to defend by any standards, let alone those of a progressive political party. Number 10 has put immense pressure on Jack Straw to toughen up Labour's act still further, so that from the decriminalisation of soft drugs to penal policy, Labour's position is barely distinguishable from that of the Tories. The calculation is that this leaves Hague little populist opportunity, but the stupidity is that it confers on him something more priceless - legitimacy and the ability to set the political agenda. Straw and his team need to steer a more careful course both in terms of principle and political advantage. The Prime Minister has taken a principled position on Europe; now he should take the same stance on civil liberties. Labour's position will be much easier if it develops - and boasts of - some first principles. Strong defence and freedom of information might appear to be disparate policies appealing to different voters. They are not. The most appropriate military protection comes with the best public scrutiny, Ministers should be able to argue. Similarly, reducing class sizes and getting rid of the notorious Section 28 can be wrongly characterised as appealing to diverse groups of electors. But both are about providing the best, most honest and appropriate education for Britain's young people in the twenty-first century. In order to champion a catalogue of policies like these - instead of fighting local skirmishes over and over again - Labour needs to adopt a coherent and convincing radical narrative. For Number 10's cautious advisers, this may seem a risk too far. New Labour has already opened up one flank by taking on the Eurosceptics over the so-called 'European army' last week; to adopt a broadly liberal approach on welfare, crime and race may seem to offer William Hague too much political leeway. Mr Blair should be reassured. Failing to argue a position or pretending to be something you are not explode all too easily in your face, as he should learn from the story of the European rapid reaction force. At first, Labour tried to smuggle the commitment through. Then it stressed what the force was not. It was only latterly that it went on the offensive arguing the case on its merits. And they are demonstrable, particularly at a time when George Bush, Mr Hague's American pal, is flirting overtly with isolationism. Labour needs the nerve to acknowledge that for all the sound and fury of last week's row over the 'European army', the Conservatives have yet to build political momentum. Of course that is still possible. The Tories are still - disgracefully - praying for an explosion of civil unrest before the next general election just as they privately welcomed the fuel tax disorders earlier this year. But so far, William Hague has achieved no more than to rebuild his coalition on the Right - the odd caravan of euro-sceptics, hard-faced business people, bloodsports campaigners and petrol protesters marching alongside diehard members of the Tory tribe. While it is loud, even hysterical, its appeal is narrow and unable to reach for the political centre. Mr Blair would be right to assert his principles. His most significant risk is still that he allows the Conservatives to set the political agenda - always the first step to winning the political argument and then elections. He should always remember that the Right is increasingly desperate and, an important lesson for Labour, no concession is or will be good enough for the right-wing press. Whatever he says or does, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph will cavil. These people all remain implacable enemies, and simply do not accept the legitimacy of even a moderate Labour government. Britain is not the natural home of conservatism it once was. We are much more tolerant and liberal than the discourse of public debate admits. People may well be unsympathetic to grand schemes of European integration, but, equally, most of us have no appetite to leave the EU. Above all, the nation looks for principle and leadership from the governing party, even if it may disagree with parts of its programme. Mr Blair and Labour thus have a momentous opportunity. Their established pledges to eliminate child poverty within 20 years, to lift the quality of public services and to heighten enrolment in university education are excellent, but they encompass too narrow a swathe of social concerns.

      "bodyText": "Millions of airline passengers could be in danger because of sweeping financial cuts demanded as part of the privatisation of Britain's air traffic control service, documents obtained by The Observer reveal. A briefing document prepared by National Air Traffic Services (Nats) last month says that plans to cut up to \u00a3165 million from their budget over the next five years will undermine safety of passengers and mean that the 1.8 million flights a year over Britain could descend into chaos. Air traffic controllers and pilot representatives spoken to by The Observer described Government plans to privatise 51 per cent of Nats, which controls air traffic across Britain's skies, as 'horrific'. 'What Nats are saying is that under these plans they cannot maintain the level of safety,' one air traffic controller said. 'Economics is taking the lead in this debate. Quite simply, that is dangerous.' He pointed out that controllers were already incredibly overstretched and, with air traffic increasing by about 7 per cent a year as more people take holiday and business trips abroad, no cuts could be afforded. The revelation of Nats' anger at the proposed cuts comes at a particularly sensitive time for the Government. Tomorrow it faces a humiliating defeat in the Lords on its plans to partially privatise air traffic control services, one of the most controversial policies it has attempted to introduce. Conservative and Liberal Democrat Lords are planning to scupper the Transport Bill which contains the plans. The Government would then have to force through the legislation using its majority in the Commons or abandon the changes until next year. As part of its consultation on the issue, the Government asked the Civil Aviation Authority, which overseas the regulation of the skies, to come up with an economic formula which would bring big savings. The CAA came up with an equation also used for other privatised utilities, the RPI minus X formula. The author ity's economic regulation group (ERG) said that real savings of 5 per cent could be found from the Nats budget every year. 'ERG is proposing a tougher X than was set for any other utility at privatisation,' the Nats briefing document says. 'This is especially inappropriate for a safety activity where service depends on adequate investment. 'ERG places too much emphasis on cost reduction and neglects the risk to service delivery.' The briefing document, dated 9 October, was handed to the white collar union which represents controllers, the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists. It echoes an earlier consultation document produced by Nats which raised similar concerns in the spring. The CAA was told to re-think their proposals on the cuts but senior air traffic sources says the follow-up plans 'were hardly any better'.It is to these later plans that the October Nats briefing refers. The general secretary of the IPMS, Paul Hoon, has now written to the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, demanding that he abandons the plans for huge cuts. 'We have profound concerns about the implications of the ERG proposals for Nats,' the letter says. 'In our view RPI minus 5 would be bound to result in severe cost cutting which would impact adversely on staffing levels, efficiency and safety. 'Bearing in mind the demands on Nats of coping with increasing air traffic and of maintaining safety it is completely unrealistic to expect the organisation to deliver major cost reductions at the same time.' Controllers are now pushing for the Government to dump the CAA plans and allow for greater investment in the service. The Government has always argued that privatising part of the air traffic control service would allow private money to be invested in it's creaking infrastructure. Lord Macdonald said that he had yet to take a decision on the cuts. 'Since I have not yet reached a decision on the level of the charge control and since CAA's advice has not been published, I do not think it would be appropriate at this stage to discuss my thinking in details,' he wrote to Noon last week.",

The controversial move would hand unprecedented powers over the lives of vulnerable children to private agencies, charities or religious organisations. It raises serious questions about the protection of youngsters. But shadow ministers argue that after a string of abuse scandals, and controversy over adoptive parents being rejected by 'politically correct' social workers, the existing system is failing. Shadow health secretary Liam Fox is drawing up the blueprint with home affairs spokesman David Lidington, who oversees the new US-style Renewing One Nation taskforce aiming to involve religious groups and the private sector in welfare. Fox told The Observer he was considering all options for adoption reform including bringing in the private sector. 'What we want to have is a properly regulated service, and I don't think it matters so much who actually does it,' he added. 'I want a proper national register for all prospective adoptive and fostering parents with an objective set of criteria, so that if you were on the register you would be considered suitable anywhere in the country. 'And we want to make sure that all children in care over a certain length of time, probably a year, would get an adoption plan drawn up for them. 'I am all in favour of not having it an exclusively state sector, as long as we have protection for children and get suitable monitoring.' The running of children's homes could also 'potentially' be contracted out to private firms, he added, and be state-regulated as private nursing homes are. Fox has studied a forthcoming report from the influential right-wing think-tank the Bow Group, which condemns the state as 'the worst parent in Britain'. It suggests that private providers be paid by results such as educational achievements for children in care, while the private sector should 'take over entirely the vetting of adoptive parents and the placement of children'. Shadow ministers are not prepared to go that far, arguing for a mix of public and private sector provision. But their plans were condemned as 'grotesque' by Shaun Woodward, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Labour and is a trustee of Childline. 'The state does not have a record without blemish. But to move from a recognition that something needs to be fixed to saying we completely give up on it and we are prepared to put it into the private sector, which at the end of the day is about profit, is fundamentally wrong.' He conceded that involving the voluntary sector in some areas could work if regulated. Ministers are expected to expand the role of children's charities in their forthcoming adoption white paper.

The guddling through ashtrays, the naked traipse through to a grim kitchen to put the kettle on, the furtive binning of the condom, the twilight, the recriminations and, according to one's circumstances, the resumption of telly or the guilty phone call or the long awkward drive back to the zoo. And, for the past two decades, and least sexily of all, people getting very ill, and then very ill indeed, and then dying.</p> <p>This is less sexy now - in the sense in which the word's been shanghai'd by commercial marketing types - than any other kind of dying. In a definitive recent survey of 24 different health charities, and the public's willingness to give to them, Aids charities expected to come below the popular killers, your cancer and hearts and strokes. They didn't necessarily expect to come absolutely last, somewhere after goitre research and chlamydia relief.</p> <p>So Nick Partridge, chief executive of the newly merged Terrence Higgins Trust and London Lighthouse project, Britain's Mr Aids, is perhaps the least cynical man in the country about Prince Charles's much-publicised visit last week to the Lighthouse hospice, where he cuddled babies and chatted to HIV positive mothers and invoked the memory of Diana. The Prince received plenty of welcome publicity, of course - though Nick insists he was 'absolutely genuinely interested in what was going on with Aids - as, to be honest, any father of teenage children in Britain today should be.' But Nick and his staff and patients got their names and pictures on the front pages too, and jumped at the chance: for this is Britain's forgotten charity. Stupidly, needlessly forgotten: for there are, today, more HIV positive people in Britain than at any time before.</p> <p>Nick explains the problem as he sits in Oxford Street's Selfridges organising determined-looking volunteers into the drizzle for a day of bin-rattling ('Selfridges have been very good to us. They've got a good corporate policy. Also, bluntly, they've got a lot of gay staff.') He is a very well-preserved 45, easy to smile and slow, these days at least, to anger.</p> <p>The problem's simple. The drugs do work. Aids is no longer the genuinely terrifying gorgon it was in the Eighties and early Nineties. Since CT - combination therapy - was introduced experimentally a few years ago to treat HIV, it has proved astonishingly good at saving lives. 'Since 1996/97, the number of people dying from Aids has dropped by 70 per cent,' Nick explains.</p> <p>'What that's meant is phenomenal. There are all the changes in our services, of course. We teach people to readjust to expect to live, rather than teaching them to plan to die. And many lives have been saved. But what it also means is - ' he sighs - 'a huge complacency. It is still such a problem. It is still transmissible. People still die. But we have to raise \u00a38m a year to keep these charities going, and yet, because of the generational thing, and prejudice, people will always leave their money to animals, or children, a long long time before they leave it to us.'</p> <p>I ask about the swiftness of the new mood. Can he remember actually feeling a sea-change in the battle against Aids, a new hope?</p> <p>'Absolutely. It was at the International Aids Conference in Vancouver in 1996, the one that heralded the combination therapy revolution. Being an American/Canadian event, they were deliberately, relentlessly upbeat - there had to be good news every day. But that didn't stop me suddenly realising there genuinely was something new. I'd been involved with Aids work since 1983 - 13 years, in which there was so much, death, illness, loss and grief. Suddenly, after all that, being able to dare to be at all optimistic, even though we were cautious, it was such a joy.</p> <p>'For me, however, it was also tinged with sadness. At the same time as the CT news was breaking, one of my colleagues, Paul, who managed the hardship fund, was dying back here in London. He was 31. He died on the final day of conference; the first thing I had to do when I returned here was to lead his funeral. So the renewed hope that combination therapy has given to so many people will always for me be coloured with the memory of those who died.'</p> <p>The last Aids-related funeral he went to was in early 1998. Before that, he was at about one a month. The change is 'unimaginable, even five years ago'. But the drugs won't cure everyone - about 500 will still die this year in Britain - and infection is on the increase once more.</p> <p>'One of the main barriers is the number of people who won't get tested, even though they suspect they might be positive - they'll be diagnosed too late and the drugs can only halt decline by then, they can't rebuild the immune system.' Today, he added, one of the two communities most affected - gay men and drug-injectors - is much safer, as the shared-needle epidemic has been largely contained, 'thanks to good public health, needle exchanges and the rest.</p> <p>'But there is real concern at the increase in new infections among young gay men. It's hard to know exactly what the figures are, but I think I know why it's happening. Remember that we're 19 years into this: an 18-year-old man now coming out and exploring his sexuality was only one or two years old when our screens were filled with the iceberg campaign.</p> <p>'But it's not just young people's ignorance: for older generations now, with the new drugs, there's a sense of wanting to try to forget, to forget the years of difficulty and misery and death. Some will behave as if they have forgotten. And, put bluntly, whether it's ignorance or complacency, both of them still kill. There are about 30,000 people in Britain today living with HIV, but only 20,000 of them know they have it.</p> <p>'I do know, of course, that being tested is still such a difficult thing to do.' (Has he been tested? 'I don't really want to talk about my own health.') 'You can have it done much faster, within a day, but the result can still devastate, even with these drugs. And there is that whole horrible thing of having to think who you may have infected, and contact them - that's what makes this so different to any other fatal illness.'</p> <p>There is, I seem to feel from him, a real and vicious anger against the virus: against its suddenness, its capriciousness, the personal devastation it has had on too many friends. He nods, quietly. 'And it's also been a useful touchstone, if you like, against prejudice. There are those who have always had difficulties with gay men and drug users and sex and death, and black Africans' - for this last class, he has explained, is the other group among whom the virus is still raging: on a recent visit to QuaZulu/Natal he found 25 per cent of the adult population were infected. 'The success of the drugs has, if you like, given them new permission to ignore these things.'</p> <p>He is still worried, he admits, even now at this late stage, of a backlash against gay men: and worried, too, 'that we might still lose against this very stupid virus.'</p> <p>Stupid?</p> <p>'Well, you're right, it is just a virus. It just goes where it is allowed to go. But, actually, yes, I do hate it. I try not to personalise it, but it's hard not to hate.

      "bodyText": "Can there be anything less sexy than what happens after sex? The guddling through ashtrays, the naked traipse through to a grim kitchen to put the kettle on, the furtive binning of the condom, the twilight, the recriminations and, according to one's circumstances, the resumption of telly or the guilty phone call or the long awkward drive back to the zoo. And, for the past two decades, and least sexily of all, people getting very ill, and then very ill indeed, and then dying. This is less sexy now - in the sense in which the word's been shanghai'd by commercial marketing types - than any other kind of dying. In a definitive recent survey of 24 different health charities, and the public's willingness to give to them, Aids charities expected to come below the popular killers, your cancer and hearts and strokes. They didn't necessarily expect to come absolutely last, somewhere after goitre research and chlamydia relief. So Nick Partridge, chief executive of the newly merged Terrence Higgins Trust and London Lighthouse project, Britain's Mr Aids, is perhaps the least cynical man in the country about Prince Charles's much-publicised visit last week to the Lighthouse hospice, where he cuddled babies and chatted to HIV positive mothers and invoked the memory of Diana. The Prince received plenty of welcome publicity, of course - though Nick insists he was 'absolutely genuinely interested in what was going on with Aids - as, to be honest, any father of teenage children in Britain today should be.' But Nick and his staff and patients got their names and pictures on the front pages too, and jumped at the chance: for this is Britain's forgotten charity. Stupidly, needlessly forgotten: for there are, today, more HIV positive people in Britain than at any time before. Nick explains the problem as he sits in Oxford Street's Selfridges organising determined-looking volunteers into the drizzle for a day of bin-rattling ('Selfridges have been very good to us. They've got a good corporate policy. Also, bluntly, they've got a lot of gay staff.') He is a very well-preserved 45, easy to smile and slow, these days at least, to anger. The problem's simple. The drugs do work. Aids is no longer the genuinely terrifying gorgon it was in the Eighties and early Nineties. Since CT - combination therapy - was introduced experimentally a few years ago to treat HIV, it has proved astonishingly good at saving lives. 'Since 1996/97, the number of people dying from Aids has dropped by 70 per cent,' Nick explains. 'What that's meant is phenomenal. There are all the changes in our services, of course. We teach people to readjust to expect to live, rather than teaching them to plan to die. And many lives have been saved. But what it also means is - ' he sighs - 'a huge complacency. It is still such a problem. It is still transmissible. People still die. But we have to raise \u00a38m a year to keep these charities going, and yet, because of the generational thing, and prejudice, people will always leave their money to animals, or children, a long long time before they leave it to us.' I ask about the swiftness of the new mood. Can he remember actually feeling a sea-change in the battle against Aids, a new hope? 'Absolutely.

'But I feel that I have been to hell and back. This man has done a terrible thing.'</p> <p>She sits quietly, hunched, and makes little eye contact. Once streetwise, now her confidence has been shattered.</p> <p>The police say there are more than 1,000 women, 93 per cent of them drug addicts, who take to Glasgow's streets regularly. At Base 75, the drop-in centre for prostitutes, workers report violent attacks, rapes and robberies at the hands of punters.</p> <p>The women are aware of men who are not averse to using them as punch-bags or who have no qualms about kicking refunds out of them. Yet there is a distinction between the violent minority of men and those who treat prostitution as a business transaction.</p> <p>Despite the violence and threats prostitutes suffer, however, the number of incidents reported is small.</p> <p>When The Observer spoke to Alison Wallace, she warned young girls away from prostitution. The same day, a fatal accident inquiry was concluding at the other side of the city. It concerned Michele Kearney, a 16-year-old whose involvement in the world of prostitution and heroin led to her death. Although placed in accommodation supervised by social workers and the subject of a care order, Michele began to work as a prostitute full time.</p> <p>Last year, she went missing from the social work flat in Springburn and was found dead at another prostitute's flat. She had choked on her vomit after injecting drugs.</p> <p>Sophia Young, project leader of Turnaround, a group that offers support to female drug-takers and women who work the streets, says all the prostitutes that come through its doors are using drugs heavily. Most use heroin and diazepam but an increasing number are turning to cocaine, which is cheap. But it is the poverty of the women and the violence against them that Young finds most disturbing.</p> <p>'The number of rapes, attempted murders, kidnaps and assaults against them is almost unbelievable,' she says. 'The West of Scotland has a real problem with violence against working women, which seems to be because more of them are visible and work on the streets.'</p> <p>At Cranstonhill police station in Glasgow's city centre there is a team of six officers, dedicated to policing and protecting the women on the drag. Resources are few at the office - one electricity power point does for the kettle and the telephone's answering machine.</p> <p>Sergeant Denis Feeney, who heads 'A' Division's street liaison team, believes most women are there to feed their own or their partner's habit. 'There is no Pretty Woman syndrome,' he insists. 'No one is there to pay for their holiday to Barbados. If a woman earns \u00a360 in a night, \u00a359 will go towards drugs. The biggest problem is not prostitution, but drugs.'</p> <p>The average age of prostitutes is around 25, but, more are becoming involved as teenagers and who come from areas such as Lanarkshire, Greenock, Clydebank and Ayrshire.</p> <p>One month after Alison Wallace was attacked, the Government announced a \u00a31.8m plan to get prostitutes off the streets by funding a drop-in centre and accommodation. Jackie Baillie, then Deputy Communities Minister, described it as 'an ambitious new initiative', but some prostitutes said the the accommodation was 'a government-sponsored broth-el'. Three months on, the number of prostitutes on Glasgow's streets is still high.</p> <p>An initiative that is proving successful, however, is the anonymous reporting scheme, which enables women to give details of crimes and criminals - via a support worker or other trusted person - without making their identities known to the police.</p> <p>'Through this we have had several successful prosecutions of people who have carried out major attacks,' said Feeney. 'At the moment we have a man awaiting trial for three rapes.'</p> <p>A memorial book held at Base 75 lists more than 50 names. Most were victims of an overdose or suicide.</p> <p>\u2022 Diane McInally, Karen McGregor, Leona McGovern, Marjorie Roberts, Jacqueline Gallagher, Tracey Wylde, Margo Lafferty and Amanda Allen all died working the drag. Of the eight inquiries, seven were murders but only one - that of Margo Lafferty - resulted in a conviction. Anyone with information about the attack on Alison Wallace is asked to call the incident room at Cranstonhill police station on 0141 532 3261/3265 or 'Crimestoppers' in confidence on 0800 555 111.</p>",

The police say there are more than 1,000 women, 93 per cent of them drug addicts, who take to Glasgow's streets regularly. At Base 75, the drop-in centre for prostitutes, workers report violent attacks, rapes and robberies at the hands of punters. The women are aware of men who are not averse to using them as punch-bags or who have no qualms about kicking refunds out of them. Yet there is a distinction between the violent minority of men and those who treat prostitution as a business transaction. Despite the violence and threats prostitutes suffer, however, the number of incidents reported is small. When The Observer spoke to Alison Wallace, she warned young girls away from prostitution. The same day, a fatal accident inquiry was concluding at the other side of the city. It concerned Michele Kearney, a 16-year-old whose involvement in the world of prostitution and heroin led to her death. Although placed in accommodation supervised by social workers and the subject of a care order, Michele began to work as a prostitute full time. Last year, she went missing from the social work flat in Springburn and was found dead at another prostitute's flat. She had choked on her vomit after injecting drugs. Sophia Young, project leader of Turnaround, a group that offers support to female drug-takers and women who work the streets, says all the prostitutes that come through its doors are using drugs heavily. Most use heroin and diazepam but an increasing number are turning to cocaine, which is cheap. But it is the poverty of the women and the violence against them that Young finds most disturbing. 'The number of rapes, attempted murders, kidnaps and assaults against them is almost unbelievable,' she says. 'The West of Scotland has a real problem with violence against working women, which seems to be because more of them are visible and work on the streets.' At Cranstonhill police station in Glasgow's city centre there is a team of six officers, dedicated to policing and protecting the women on the drag. Resources are few at the office - one electricity power point does for the kettle and the telephone's answering machine. Sergeant Denis Feeney, who heads 'A' Division's street liaison team, believes most women are there to feed their own or their partner's habit. 'There is no Pretty Woman syndrome,' he insists. 'No one is there to pay for their holiday to Barbados. If a woman earns \u00a360 in a night, \u00a359 will go towards drugs. The biggest problem is not prostitution, but drugs.' The average age of prostitutes is around 25, but, more are becoming involved as teenagers and who come from areas such as Lanarkshire, Greenock, Clydebank and Ayrshire. One month after Alison Wallace was attacked, the Government announced a \u00a31.8m plan to get prostitutes off the streets by funding a drop-in centre and accommodation. Jackie Baillie, then Deputy Communities Minister, described it as 'an ambitious new initiative', but some prostitutes said the the accommodation was 'a government-sponsored broth-el'. Three months on, the number of prostitutes on Glasgow's streets is still high. An initiative that is proving successful, however, is the anonymous reporting scheme, which enables women to give details of crimes and criminals - via a support worker or other trusted person - without making their identities known to the police. 'Through this we have had several successful prosecutions of people who have carried out major attacks,' said Feeney. 'At the moment we have a man awaiting trial for three rapes.' A memorial book held at Base 75 lists more than 50 names. Most were victims of an overdose or suicide. \u2022 Diane McInally, Karen McGregor, Leona McGovern, Marjorie Roberts, Jacqueline Gallagher, Tracey Wylde, Margo Lafferty and Amanda Allen all died working the drag. Of the eight inquiries, seven were murders but only one - that of Margo Lafferty - resulted in a conviction. Anyone with information about the attack on Alison Wallace is asked to call the incident room at Cranstonhill police station on 0141 532 3261/3265 or 'Crimestoppers' in confidence on 0800 555 111.",

      "byline": "Simon Caulkin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With stricken dotcoms falling fast it's hard to resist a trace of schadenfreude at the sight of Silicon Valley twentysomethings lamenting premature midlife crises and US start-ups stampeding to remove the '.com' from their names. Only the most unscrupulous company promoter will mourn the end of 'cyperbole' - but it would be equally dangerous to lurch to the opposite extreme and conclude that the internet show is over and it's back to business as before. </p> <p>'The market crash was very cathartic,' says Don Tapscott, internet observer and co-author of Digital Capital , one of the best attempts so far to get under the froth to establish what's really happening to business on the web. 'It ended the period when everyone thought it was about websites, dotcoms, IPOs and off to the races. The real issue is how it changes business models in the commanding heights of the economy.' </p> <p>For that, look no further than the music industry, the example with which the obliging book opens. The force of the internet, say the authors, is that it fundamentally transforms the economics of organisations. By lowering transaction costs - the costs of searching for information, drawing up contracts and coordinating activities - the internet makes it feasible to do things outside the company that it previously made more sense to do inside. </p> <p>This potentially means the end not just of vertically integrated companies (imagine that, just a generation ago, Unilever owned oil palm plantations and ships to carry the raw materials to its factories), but of conventionally integrated companies of any sort. </p> <p>In the past it was most cost-effective to carry out the expensive interlinked activities of finding music acts and recording them, doing deals and arranging manufacture and distribution within a large corpora tion - hence the domination of giants such as Time-Warner, EMI and Bertelsmann. </p> <p>But the internet has pulled the whole value chain apart. Digitalisation and the peer-to-peer MP3 standard mean that manufacturing and distribution costs drop to nothing - indeed the latter is carried out by consumers themselves. By the same token, musicians don't need the record companies, either, since they can distribute their music in the form they choose from their own websites. </p> <p>A new business model emerges in which, for example, a band uses free distribution on the web to sell tickets for a concert tour. </p> <p>Or take Napster, the MP3 site being sued for copyright infringement, which has now done a deal with Bertelsmann that will allow the former to distribute singles on low-cost subscription while retaining control of its copyright for use in other forms. </p> <p>Or look at the traditional business of stockbroking. It consists of market data and analysis, news and views, advice and discussion groups as well as the transaction of buying or selling shares. Tapscott explains: 'The internet allows us to break all that up into its constituent parts, reaggregate it on the web, brand it and you have businesses like E*Trade and Schwab which have taken away one-third of a whole industry's revenue.' </p> <p>The strength of Digital Capital is that it has many examples like this. Based originally on a company-funded research programme looking into the business implications of online communities, it changed its emphasis as the internet took off to shifting coalitions of companies forming 'e-business communities'. </p> <p>These finally crystallised into business webs, or 'b-webs', which Tapscott characterises as the new model of organisation for the internet age - 'the generic vessel into which all companies fall, in the same way as \"corporation\" was the catch-all term in the industrial age'. </p> <p>The classic b-web is Cisco Systems, the internet router manufacturer with 32,000 employees and 40 plants. Just 17,000 members of staff and three plants actually belong to the mother company.

      "bodyText": "With stricken dotcoms falling fast it's hard to resist a trace of schadenfreude at the sight of Silicon Valley twentysomethings lamenting premature midlife crises and US start-ups stampeding to remove the '.com' from their names. Only the most unscrupulous company promoter will mourn the end of 'cyperbole' - but it would be equally dangerous to lurch to the opposite extreme and conclude that the internet show is over and it's back to business as before. 'The market crash was very cathartic,' says Don Tapscott, internet observer and co-author of Digital Capital , one of the best attempts so far to get under the froth to establish what's really happening to business on the web. 'It ended the period when everyone thought it was about websites, dotcoms, IPOs and off to the races. The real issue is how it changes business models in the commanding heights of the economy.' For that, look no further than the music industry, the example with which the obliging book opens. The force of the internet, say the authors, is that it fundamentally transforms the economics of organisations. By lowering transaction costs - the costs of searching for information, drawing up contracts and coordinating activities - the internet makes it feasible to do things outside the company that it previously made more sense to do inside. This potentially means the end not just of vertically integrated companies (imagine that, just a generation ago, Unilever owned oil palm plantations and ships to carry the raw materials to its factories), but of conventionally integrated companies of any sort. In the past it was most cost-effective to carry out the expensive interlinked activities of finding music acts and recording them, doing deals and arranging manufacture and distribution within a large corpora tion - hence the domination of giants such as Time-Warner, EMI and Bertelsmann. But the internet has pulled the whole value chain apart. Digitalisation and the peer-to-peer MP3 standard mean that manufacturing and distribution costs drop to nothing - indeed the latter is carried out by consumers themselves. By the same token, musicians don't need the record companies, either, since they can distribute their music in the form they choose from their own websites. A new business model emerges in which, for example, a band uses free distribution on the web to sell tickets for a concert tour. Or take Napster, the MP3 site being sued for copyright infringement, which has now done a deal with Bertelsmann that will allow the former to distribute singles on low-cost subscription while retaining control of its copyright for use in other forms. Or look at the traditional business of stockbroking. It consists of market data and analysis, news and views, advice and discussion groups as well as the transaction of buying or selling shares. Tapscott explains: 'The internet allows us to break all that up into its constituent parts, reaggregate it on the web, brand it and you have businesses like E*Trade and Schwab which have taken away one-third of a whole industry's revenue.' The strength of Digital Capital is that it has many examples like this. Based originally on a company-funded research programme looking into the business implications of online communities, it changed its emphasis as the internet took off to shifting coalitions of companies forming 'e-business communities'. These finally crystallised into business webs, or 'b-webs', which Tapscott characterises as the new model of organisation for the internet age - 'the generic vessel into which all companies fall, in the same way as \"corporation\" was the catch-all term in the industrial age'. The classic b-web is Cisco Systems, the internet router manufacturer with 32,000 employees and 40 plants. Just 17,000 members of staff and three plants actually belong to the mother company. Cisco is the 'context provider' that orchestrates the 'content' provided by its manufacturing and other affiliates. Cisco also manages, largely through its e-commerce website, its relationships with its end-customers - the direct 'relationship capital' for lack of which the music industry is now being trashed by its customers just like a hotel room being trashed by a rock band. 'The most important thing about what we call the new economy is that business-model innovation is the key to success,' says Tapscott. 'The beauty of it is that it applies to banks, chemical and mining companies as much as anyone else.' Witness Enron, an old-line US utility that has reinvented itself as a marketplace for energy, telecom bandwidth and much else besides. Tapscott believes that the process of taking apart old com panies and putting them together again on the internet has only just begun. His current research is into the implications for current business models of the mobile economy, in which almost everything that has power will be interconnected in what he calls the 'hypernet'. Although the floods of change may have receded a bit in the last few months, that's just a pause for breath, says Tapscott ominously. Further ahead is a programme investigating the effects of all this on governance and democracy, the last area of public life to move with the new technologies. Several nations, including the US and the UK, have signed up. Mobile, transnational economies call into question everything nations hold dear. 'Up till now we've had a broadcast democracy: \"Hey, listen up\". Now we have one-to-one communications and interactive technologies. It will change the way we do politics. You could have a citizens' brainstorm.' Truly, says Tapscott solemnly, we are only at the end of the beginning.",

A flagship daily still losing sales steadily - by 2 or 3 per cent every year - and selling only 900,000 or so when you strip out the bulks and cut-price deals: a Sunday partner in an even more parlous plight; and a sprauncy little red-top tabloid that wins praise for making much of scant resources, but with a half-million circulation heavily dependent on the North of England and even more dependent on 90,000 sales of one sort or another in Ireland. </p> <p>There's nothing central to any of the titles' positioning here.

But Desmond - without other newspapers to his name - brings nothing obvious to the synergy table. Cost-cutting savings have been squeezed from the Express group for years. That cupboard is bare. It isn't deals the Expresses need, it's investment. </p> <p>These are all marginal brands now, only a slip or two away from the big drop right off advertising schedules. And the figures, from an ad agency point of view, are unforgiving. Readership - on the latest NRS survey - can be made to look quite decent: 2.4 million a day, still a tad more than the Telegraph and more than the Times and Independent combined. But these aren't the comparisons that matter. The Daily Mail has 5.6 million readers - and its curve continues upwards; the Mail on Sunday (at 6 million) dwarfs the Sunday ver sion of the Express (2.3 million). </p> <p>Worse, Express readers, in spite of some gallant improvements under Rosie Boycott's editorship, are still too old, dying off by the year and making the business of gaining circulation over and above this natural decline even more daunting. </p> <p>The Mail has 718,000 readers aged between 25 and 34, the Express only 283,000. The Mail, moreover, has almost unlimited resources. Now it can, and will, turn that panzer division of pounds sterling against Desmond - just as the Mirror and Sun (from still stronger circulation bunkers) can outspend the Star at every turn. </p> <p>How does Desmond hope to take on these formidable battalions? So far - apart from his installation of a non-journalist editorial director to oversee the daily decision-making of the editors he inherits - the emphasis is all on joint bidding for the kind of celebrity picture exclusives he has used to build his OK! against Hello! To start, the Express gets photos from Catherine Zeta Jones's wedding. </p> <p>Yet, quite apart from pushing the Mail and Hello! into a rival consortium, it's difficult to see how this particular synergy can make durable sense. OK! sells at \u00a31.85p and the cash surge from 200,000 or so extra sales is formidable. Daily middle market or red-top papers can put on something approaching such sales for a day if there's something really juicy on offer - but next day that impact has gone. The key to Mail success has been a brand that can sustain itself and grow through the days when nobody in particular is getting married, giving birth or welcoming the cameras into her lovely home. </p> <p>What Desmond has to do, in short, is to create a trio of all-round newspapers that attract readers every day of the week for what they are, not what they can occasionally offer on muddy newsprint rather than glossy mag sheets. To do that he will need editors committed to development over long years of hard pounding, with the freedom to give their papers an individual feel that may attract vital young readers, many of whom do not buy newspapers regularly but pick up the headlines from TV and flesh out their week by reading targeted mag-azines such as OK! </p> <p>One long-term factor of Express decline, in short, has been the success of competitors like Desmond's own celebrity magazine: and the same, save for the Mail , could be said to be true across the tabloid market. These magazines and newspapers don't go together. They are natural competitors. Put them together and what have you got? A very messy balancing act. Who gets first pickings? Who wants to see their wedding on newsprint first? </p> <p>Desmond may surprise us all with his answers.</p> <p><strong>Private, but on parade. OK?</strong></p> <p> Can you stage a 'private and confidential' wedding for 350 celebrity guests in the Plaza Hotel, New York, if you're Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas? Only British judges, in the majestic dottiness of our law, would think so. </p> <p>The war of the glossy celebrity mags is quite as fierce as anything Fleet Street can currently offer. OK! magazine bought exclusive picture rights to the Douglas nuptials for \u00a31 million; Hello! got some other, rather fuzzy snaps from an agency and ran a classic spoiler. OK! sought and won an injunction and, for a couple of days, it looked as though Hello! would be Goodbye! - a week's issue banned and pulped. But no, at the last, the Appeal Court thought not. This, apparently, is a case for damages, not bans. </p> <p>It ought also to be a case for some hard thinking all round. Richard Desmond, the new owner of the Express Group, is the owner of OK! (which has knocked Hello! off its circulation perch). He intends, quite explicitly, to use his glossy buying power as a weapon against the Mail, Mirror and Sun. </p> <p>After Posh and Becks, Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey, wedding pictures stand, bizarrely, at the cutting edge of competition - if they can be kept really exclusive. But what if some uninvited or free-spirited guest imports a box Brownie under cover of confetti? Then Michael and Catherine are 'very, very upset', steam into court, and one judge at least feels their financial and emotional distress. The rub, though, is whether other judges agree - over this and thus in many prospective disputes over millionaire weddings to come. </p> <p>A 'private' wedding, in common sense, is a few members of a family celebrating behind closed doors. It isn't half Hollywood taking over the Plaza for the night. How can wedding pictures be deemed 'confidential' when they're sold for imminent publication? British law, in a familiar bind over privacy, is bumbling along in the wake of events - but one bit of case law would seem to operate sensibly. </p> <p>When the Mirror, a few years back, picked up an illicit copy of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, bought for serialisation by the Sunday Times, the court then found no breach of confidentiality because the book was scheduled for swift publication. That appears to be the Appeal Court's view, too: any hurt can be addressed, after the event, by a suit for damages. </p> <p>Who, however, can produce evidence of such hurt? Not Mr and Mrs Douglas, who took Stasi-like security precautions at the door. They'll be paid. And not, you'd think, OK! - pavilioned in much free publicity. Even the Press Complaints Commission, which draws a distinction between the privacy of a hotel bedroom and the non-privacy of the Plaza ballroom, would walk away from this one. The big issue is whether celebrity sales of lavish 'private' occasions has anything to do with the privacy ordinary people feel so strongly about - and, beyond that, whether privacy is a commodity to be sold in segments and then regained if a wedding goes sour. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Desmond may have a lot more litigating to do along his chosen course: and only the lawyers are smiling.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Kenneth Tynan famously wrote that 'I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger '. As for me, I doubt if I could love anyone who didn't wish to see Singin ' in the Rain again and again and again. I first saw it in 1952 when at a very low ebb. They say you can't remember pain. But you can remember misery well enough and on the last day of my first six weeks of army basic training at Warrington's smog-shrouded, grime-encrusted Peninsula Barracks I felt terrible. The rough khaki uniform gave me a constant itch. Enforced daily shaving had created a painful rash for which a medical orderly gave me a foul ointment of a kind a vet might have prescribed for scrapie. My feet were blistered by square-bashing, my left shoulder bone bruised from supporting a rifle. I'd been sworn at and humiliated by sadistic sergeants and moronic corporals, and I still had 98 weeks left to serve.</p> <p>After a farcical passing-out parade with a band playing the regimental march ('God Bless the Prince of Wales') we were free for the rest of the day before moving on to another barracks for more of the same. My comrades-in-arms went off to the Naafi and I headed for the nearest cinema. As a member of 'HM Forces in uniform' (the H had recently switched from His to Her), I was admitted for ninepence (less than four pennies in today's money) and the movie was Singin' in the Rain , which had been received with muted enthusiasm by the critics and everywhere compared unfavourably with On the Town, the previous film by the same production team.</p> <p>So I wasn't expecting too much when I entered the continuous performance at the final point of the montage showing Hollywood's transition to sound - the song 'Beautiful Girl'. Immediately thereafter, singing star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is reunited with ingenue Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), they enter an empty sound stage where with the artifice of a cyclorama and a wind machine he creates a sunset and a light breeze to serenade her with the beautiful Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown song 'You Were Meant for Me'. This was pure cinema, the most romantic thing I had ever seen. I was raised from the spiritual lower depths, my heavy army boots exchanged for ballet shoes as I imagined I was Kelly dancing with Reynolds.</p> <p>I saw the movie to the end and sat through it twice more, thrilling to every scene. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'em Laugh' was brilliant, but a little too close to Kelly's 'Be a Clown' in The Pirate (plagiarism by Arthur Freed or a homage to Cole Porter?) his duet with Kelly of 'Moses Supposes' is sublime. Kelly's pas seul of 'Singin' in the Rain' is magnificent, and I used to test my memory by recalling all the shops in the drenched Hollywood street. The 'Good Morning' routine, which revived Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds after the disastrous preview the way I was rescued from my barrack-room blues, was sublime. The bit I had doubts about was the ambitious (pretentious?) 'Broadway Melody' sequence, an attempt to match the finale of An American in Paris, though I'm now inclined to excuse it as a postmodernist joke in the light of studio boss R.F. Simpson's comment that he'd have to see it before he could understand it.</p> <p>I emerged from the cinema that evening elated, thinking of life outside and beyond the Army. The film made me want to emigrate to the States more than ever, to become an American. As a comic view of Hollywood, a metaphor for my fanciful notion of America, it perfectly complemented the tragic view of Billy Wilder's 1950 Sunset Boulevard. It confirmed my naive ambition to write about movies so I could share the joy they gave me and challenge the ignorance of Fleet Street reviewers and the grudging equivocations of Sight and Sound, to which I'd lately become a subscriber. The surprising thing is that as I saw Singin' in the Rain every couple of years over the next two decades, my love and admiration were enhanced rather than diminished.</p> <p>When it at last appeared on TV my family taped the soundtrack, and we'd listen to the playback, recreating the images in our minds. Since the coming of the video cassette I've seen it more often, perhaps too easily. It is, to me, a perfect cocktail of wit, elegance, ebullience and grace, intoxication without a hangover, an innocent Eden to be visited by those well acquainted with good and evil. It's the movie I'd take to a desert island, the film I'd risk my life to save for posterity should the National Film Archive be consumed by flames.</p> <p>If I were the Minister of Health, I'd see that chemists were well stocked with cassettes of Singin' in the Rain and encourage doctors to prescribe it for depressed patients. Does any work of art have a more agreeably therapeutic title?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kenneth Tynan famously wrote that 'I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger '. As for me, I doubt if I could love anyone who didn't wish to see Singin ' in the Rain again and again and again. I first saw it in 1952 when at a very low ebb. They say you can't remember pain. But you can remember misery well enough and on the last day of my first six weeks of army basic training at Warrington's smog-shrouded, grime-encrusted Peninsula Barracks I felt terrible. The rough khaki uniform gave me a constant itch. Enforced daily shaving had created a painful rash for which a medical orderly gave me a foul ointment of a kind a vet might have prescribed for scrapie. My feet were blistered by square-bashing, my left shoulder bone bruised from supporting a rifle. I'd been sworn at and humiliated by sadistic sergeants and moronic corporals, and I still had 98 weeks left to serve. After a farcical passing-out parade with a band playing the regimental march ('God Bless the Prince of Wales') we were free for the rest of the day before moving on to another barracks for more of the same. My comrades-in-arms went off to the Naafi and I headed for the nearest cinema. As a member of 'HM Forces in uniform' (the H had recently switched from His to Her), I was admitted for ninepence (less than four pennies in today's money) and the movie was Singin' in the Rain , which had been received with muted enthusiasm by the critics and everywhere compared unfavourably with On the Town, the previous film by the same production team. So I wasn't expecting too much when I entered the continuous performance at the final point of the montage showing Hollywood's transition to sound - the song 'Beautiful Girl'. Immediately thereafter, singing star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is reunited with ingenue Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), they enter an empty sound stage where with the artifice of a cyclorama and a wind machine he creates a sunset and a light breeze to serenade her with the beautiful Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown song 'You Were Meant for Me'. This was pure cinema, the most romantic thing I had ever seen. I was raised from the spiritual lower depths, my heavy army boots exchanged for ballet shoes as I imagined I was Kelly dancing with Reynolds. I saw the movie to the end and sat through it twice more, thrilling to every scene. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'em Laugh' was brilliant, but a little too close to Kelly's 'Be a Clown' in The Pirate (plagiarism by Arthur Freed or a homage to Cole Porter?) his duet with Kelly of 'Moses Supposes' is sublime. Kelly's pas seul of 'Singin' in the Rain' is magnificent, and I used to test my memory by recalling all the shops in the drenched Hollywood street. The 'Good Morning' routine, which revived Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds after the disastrous preview the way I was rescued from my barrack-room blues, was sublime. The bit I had doubts about was the ambitious (pretentious?) 'Broadway Melody' sequence, an attempt to match the finale of An American in Paris, though I'm now inclined to excuse it as a postmodernist joke in the light of studio boss R.F. Simpson's comment that he'd have to see it before he could understand it. I emerged from the cinema that evening elated, thinking of life outside and beyond the Army. The film made me want to emigrate to the States more than ever, to become an American. As a comic view of Hollywood, a metaphor for my fanciful notion of America, it perfectly complemented the tragic view of Billy Wilder's 1950 Sunset Boulevard. It confirmed my naive ambition to write about movies so I could share the joy they gave me and challenge the ignorance of Fleet Street reviewers and the grudging equivocations of Sight and Sound, to which I'd lately become a subscriber. The surprising thing is that as I saw Singin' in the Rain every couple of years over the next two decades, my love and admiration were enhanced rather than diminished. When it at last appeared on TV my family taped the soundtrack, and we'd listen to the playback, recreating the images in our minds. Since the coming of the video cassette I've seen it more often, perhaps too easily. It is, to me, a perfect cocktail of wit, elegance, ebullience and grace, intoxication without a hangover, an innocent Eden to be visited by those well acquainted with good and evil. It's the movie I'd take to a desert island, the film I'd risk my life to save for posterity should the National Film Archive be consumed by flames. If I were the Minister of Health, I'd see that chemists were well stocked with cassettes of Singin' in the Rain and encourage doctors to prescribe it for depressed patients. Does any work of art have a more agreeably therapeutic title?",

      "body": "<p><strong>Jilly Cooper</strong><br></p> <p> Anyone wanting an introduction to the lunacy, avarice and sexual merry-go-round of the New York contemporary art scene should read <strong> Danny Moynihan's </strong> marvellously funny and accomplished novel, <strong> Boogie Woogie</strong> (Duckworth). Having run galleries, curated and exhibited himself, Moynihan knows everything about bent dealers, pretentious collectors and thrusting young artists. All the characters are so awful that one ends up very fond of the less awful ones. </p> <p><strong>Katherine Whitehorn</strong><br> </p> <p> I usually read paperbacks, so my books of the year are mostly last year's - and the best novel, <strong> The Homemaker </strong>by <strong>Dorothy Canfield Fisher</strong>, was resurrected from 1924 by Persephone Books. This is about a miserably obsessive housewife who is able to take a satisfying job only when her husband is crippled. However, I enjoyed <strong> The Pale Abyssinian </strong> (HarperCollins), <strong> Miles Bredin's </strong> witty biography of James Bruce, the preposterous Scot who discovered the source of the White Nile, and <strong> Yvonne Roberts </strong> 's gripping novel, <strong> A History of Insects</strong> (Headline) about residual snobbery in Pakistan after the Raj. </p> <p><strong>Paul Bailey</strong><br> </p> <p> I found<strong> Victoria Clark's </strong> study of the Orthodox Church in Europe, <strong> Why Angels Fall </strong> (Macmillan), absolutely engrossing. The book provides insights into a Christian religion notably different from either Roman Catholicism or Protestantism. The novel that most impressed me was <strong> Alasdair MacLeod's No Great Mischief </strong> (Cape), a haunting family history set in the wilds of Canada and the Scottish Highlands. <strong> Lorna Sage's </strong> memoir of her nightmarish childhood, <strong> Bad Blood</strong> (Fourth Estate) is funny, moving, and wonderfully written. In <strong> The Million Dollar Mermaid by Esther Williams with Digby Diehl </strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster), the aquatic film star says of her third husband, the relentlessly priapic Fernando Lamas, 'He talked about his penis as if it were a dear and talented friend, with excellent posture.' Thanks to Digby, Esther's autobiography is crammed with similar memorable conceits. </p> <p><strong>Jacqueline Rose</strong><br> </p> <p> Both my books this year come from or return to South Africa. <strong> Gillian Slovo's Red Dust </strong> (Virago) transforms South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with extraordinary skill, into an impossible-to-put-down detective story so that the reader is forced to enter the minds of all sides of the apartheid era, oppressor and victim alike. <strong> Marlene Van Neikerk's </strong> prize-winning Afrikaans novel <strong> Triomf </strong> (Little,Brown) rescues for South African literature the forgotten white trash of the country, while presenting its staggeringly dysfunctional, sometimes inspired, family in such uncompromising terms that Coetzee's Disgrace seems positively redemptive in comparison. </p> <p><strong>David Cannadine</strong><br> </p> <p> Here are three books which should stimulate and divert the mind over the seasonal shutdown.<strong> Michael Howard's The Invention of Peace: Reflections on War and International Order</strong> (Profile) distils a lifetime's learning by our greatest military historian. <strong> John Simpson's A Mad World, My Masters: Tales from a Traveller's Life</strong> (Macmillan) is by turns hilarious and horrifying. And <strong> Simon Schama's A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC) is a bravura performance by the Lord Macaulay of our day. </p> <p><strong>Paul Muldoon</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the best books of poetry of the past year was <strong> Derek Mahon's Selected Poems</strong> (Penguin). Among numerous other distinctions, Mahon is the single most effective manager of the long stanza since Philip Larkin, as is clear from such anthology pieces as 'A Disused Shed in County Wexford' and 'A Garage in County Cork'. </p> <p><strong>Kathy Lette</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Mortimer</strong> is in his anecdotage and his autobiographical <strong> The Summer of a Dormouse </strong> (Viking), a mix of warmth, wit and wisdom is my book of the year. Whether ruminating on Napoleon's dick, the poor bastard who was jailed for sleeping with his own wife while wearing a beard, the Princess and the dipsomaniac Irish undertaker or the Swede caught spanking his wife with a live eel (and fined for cruelty to animals), the mischievous Mortimer weaves comedy and compassion into his prose. </p> <p><strong>Simon Callow</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Tom Phillips's </strong> millennium project, <strong> The Postcard Century</strong> (Thames &amp; Hudson) is an inexhaustibly fascinating account of private lives and public images over the past 100 years, as intimate and authentic an account of the experience of being alive at that time as we shall ever have. <strong> Thomas Wright's Oscar Wilde: Table Talk</strong> (Cassell) suggests more than anything else in print what it was like to hear the great man do what he did better than anyone: talk. </p> <p><strong>John Mortimer</strong><br> </p> <p> A plot which involves two alleged Lord Lucans and a lady psychiatrist who faked the stigmata could only have gestated in the fertile brain of <strong> Muriel Spark</strong>.<strong> Aiding and Abetting</strong> (Viking) is written with the meticulous sparkle which makes her prose the envy of contemporary writers. We live at a time when we seem to be determined to cut ourselves off from our history, a fatal tendency that might be cured by <strong> Simon Schama's </strong> excitingly readable <strong> A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 1,000 BC to AD 1603</strong> (BBC), full of kings and battles, puts an end to the fashionable idea that history should only be studied in the lives of medieval bakers or eighteenth-century piano tuners. Finally, the English obsession with verdant and manicured lawns is entertainingly weeded and watered in <strong> Tom Fort's The Grass is Greener: Our Love Affair with the Lawn</strong> (HarperCollins). It contains one of the best descriptions of a potting shed ever written. </p> <p><strong>Adam Mars-Jones</strong><br> </p> <p> The novel and the book of stories I most enjoyed this year are both products of creative Indian summers: <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) and <strong> Penelope Fitzgerald's The Means of Escape</strong> (Flamingo). Roth's novel addresses with subtlety the issues of sex, race, identity. Fitzgerald, whose death this year ends a brilliant literary career that began when she was 60, constantly brushes up against profundity without ever seeming to have designs on it. A striking debut collection of stories was <strong> Never Trust A Rabbit </strong> by<strong> Jeremy Dyson</strong> (Duckworth). His stories nestle in the little vacant chink between Roald Dahl and Borges. <strong> Jeremy Seabrook's Love in a Different Climate: Men Who Have Sex with Men in India</strong> (Verso) is illuminating - an attempt to describe taboo experience without imposing Western assumptions. </p> <p><strong>Stephen Bayley</strong><br> </p> <p> I checked and I haven't actually read anything in the Amazon Hot 100. Not even The Thunderbirds Colouring Book, or David Beckham: My World. It's been a thin year for good books. Certainly, no fiction that sticks. I devoured <strong> Michael Lewis's The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story </strong> (Coronet), a pacy romp around the idiot-savant computer geek Jim Clark, but it's really just a long article, like so many US business books. Two late 1999 publications that have real value are <strong> James Campbell's This is the Beat Generation</strong> (Secker &amp; Warburg) , an excellent popular history of Kerouac, Ginsberg and their dissolute company, and the re-issue by Books &amp; Co/Helen Marx Books of <strong> Iris Origo's </strong> gloriously elegant 1953 life: <strong> Leopardi - A Study in Solitude</strong>. This last has a new introduction by <strong> Shirley Hazzard</strong> whose miniature <strong> Greene on Capri</strong> (Virago) was a small pleasure, full of fine observation and detail. But best of all has been <strong> City Secrets: Rome</strong> (The Little Bookroom) edited by <strong> Robert Kahn</strong>. This is a straightforward compilation of art, architecture and restaurant tips by people who really know the city: it's cruelly tempting, insightful and inspiring, as well as being nicely designed. The ordinary thing done extraordinary well: I'd never lend my copy, it's always in use. </p> <p><strong>Melvyn Bragg</strong><br></p> <p> The latest collection of <strong> Alan Jenkins's </strong> poems,<strong> The Drift</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus), is stunningly good. Full of passionate regret, clear, erudite, both a chronicle of the poet's time and a comment on it in poems as fine as any being written today. It is some sort of minor miracle that <strong> Michael Donaghy's </strong> masterly collection comes out in the same year as Jenkins. <strong> Conjure </strong> (Picador) contains poems which are as deeply structured, as lucid, moving and witty as Auden at his best. He brings powerful forces to bear on the memory of deep attachments and his vivid story-telling sense is a marvel. <strong> Adam Phillips's Promises, Promises: Essays on Psychoanalysis and Literature</strong> (Faber) is a brilliant collection of essays around the subjects in which disciplines Phillips excels. </p> <p> <strong>Rowan Pelling</strong><br></p> <p> I have just started the book which I have waited patiently for all year - <strong>Philip Pullman's</strong> finale to his 'Dark Materials' trilogy,<strong> The Amber Spyglass</strong>. After only 20 pages I find myself spellbound by Pullman's storytelling. All my godchildren will receive the complete hardback set for Christmas.</p> <p> <strong>Ian Hislop</strong><br></p> <p> Having been a judge in the recent Blue Peter Book Awards, I have read a lot more children's fiction this year than anything aimed at adults. This probably explains why most of the books have seemed so well-written and entertaining. Can I recommend <strong>The Shadow of the Minotaur by Alan Gibbons</strong> (Dolphin Paperback) and <strong>Pilgrim's Progress by Geraldine McCaughrean</strong> (Hodder)? You should probably find a child to give them to, but you could do a lot worse than read them yourself first.</p> <p> <strong>Philip Hensher</strong><br></p> <p> The novels I liked best this year were<strong> Jane Smiley's</strong> grand, detailed <strong>Horse Heaven</strong> (Faber), one of those books which seems interested in absolutely everything, and <strong>Patrick McGrath's Martha Peake</strong> (Viking). He is a one-off; someone who has infused the tawdry old genre of the Gothic novel with a showy, enchanting intelligence. I simply could not put down <strong>John Drummond's</strong> entertainingly poisonous memoirs, <strong>Tainted By Experience</strong> (Faber). <strong>Graham Robb's life of Rimbaud</strong> (Picador) was unfailingly good; a calm, sceptical eye turned on a turbulent life. <strong>Helen Simpson's</strong> collection <strong>Hey Yeah Right Get A Life</strong> (Cape) was simply brilliant. Individual stories gave only a suggestion of the cumulative, terrifying force of the whole book. She has always been funny; with this, she displays herself a writer of unusual power. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Many UK investors naturally choose to invest in UK shares. In many ways this makes sense - it protects investors from currency movements and means they are investing in at least some companies they know.</p> <p>But they could be missing out. The UK stockmarket has not performed particularly well over the last two years, and investors would have been better off putting their money in the US or Europe. So how do you know which market is going to perform best in the future? </p> <p>One of the easiest ways is to buy an investment trust that invests globally and spreads your money all round the world.</p> <p>The global growth trusts, previously known as international generalists, are some of the oldest and largest in the investment trust industry. The granddaddy of them all is Foreign &amp; Colonial, which was set up in 1868 to give smaller investors easy, low-cost access to overseas stockmarkets. It is still fulfilling the same role nowadays. </p> <p>'In many ways these trusts were ahead of their time,' says Peter Walls of stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe. 'Today everybody is talking about globalisation and the need for investors to think more internationally. These trusts have always had that perspective.'</p> <p>What you get with a global growth investment trust is a 'one-stop shop'. As Robert Graham of Dunfermline-based independent financial advisers Scottish Financial Independence points out: 'You have a complete investment portfolio in one trust.' </p> <p>They are typically invested around 50 per cent in the UK and the rest overseas. Having such a diversified investment helps to reduce your risk. If some economies are performing poorly, the chances are this will be offset by growth elsewhere. For any investor concerned about the volatility of shares, the very longevity of these global growth giants must be reassuring. They have survived world wars, depressions and numerous bull and bear markets.</p> <p>There are 33 global growth trusts which adopt a variety of different approaches to achieve their objectives. This is why if you are investing a large amount of money, a financial adviser might recommend that you choose more than one. Mark Dampier, head of research at Bristol-based advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Global growth trusts make fantastic core holdings. With a large investment, I would normally suggest a spread of five or six trusts so that you get a variety of investment styles.'</p> <p>Such differences can be seen among the four largest trusts: Foreign &amp; Colonial (\u00a33.2 billion), Witan (\u00a32.1bn) Alliance (\u00a32bn), Scottish Mortgage (\u00a31.9bn). Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, tends to invest more overseas than its counterparts. Fund manager Jeremy Tigue explains: 'We currently have 350 investments spread around 30 different countries. When the management team get together we decide where to invest on the basis of where we can find the most good stocks and good ideas.'But he stresses that any changes in geographical emphasis tend to take place on a gradual basis.</p> <p>Stockbroker Merrill Lynch points out differences between other trusts. Alliance, it says, is 'conservatively run' whereas Scottish Mortgage is 'prepared to take large asset allocation bets'. Alliance's investment manager Gavin Suggett is unabashed about his trust's reputation. He says: 'There is an element of truth in calling us \"dull and boring\". The fact is we manage the trust on the assumption that it is a core holding. Therefore, we don't want to give our investors any nasty surprises and, for this reason, we don't take any big bets.' </p> <p>Scottish Mortgage's more aggressive approach can sometimes produce volatility and, indeed, manager James Anderson was recently forced to apologise to shareholders after the trust fell in value earlier this year due to its over exposure to telecoms stocks.</p> <p>In general, though, global growth trusts tend to produce steady, long-term performance. Fund managers pay particular attention to getting good returns as these trusts are normally regarded as the group's flagship. Consistency is helped by the fact that they are usually a team effort. At Witan, where a new investment director James Robinson has recently taken over, the talents of the seven specialist investment managers from Henderson who will be working with him, as they did with his predecessor Christopher Clarke, are seen as a particular strength.</p> <p>Recent figures show that the trusts have generally kept pace with or outshone the FT-All Share Index but they rarely make it to the top of the charts as do more specialist trusts. </p> <p>But Mark Dampier, of Hargreaves Lansdown, sees it as a tortoise and hare race. He says: 'Sometimes specialist trusts shoot out in front but in the end it is often the global trusts, which have been making steady headway all along, that come out the real winners.' He points out that average returns of 12 per cent per annum are typical.</p> <p>Alliance's Gavin Suggett also emphasises the role of low management charges in contributing to the trusts' long-term success. Alliance has the lowest charges of any investment trust of a mere 0.13 per cent per annum but the other large international trusts do not charge much more. </p> <p>At Foreign &amp; Colonial total expenses are 0.42 per cent, while at Witan and Scottish Mortgage they are 0.34 per cent and 0.38 per cent respectively.</p>",

In many ways this makes sense - it protects investors from currency movements and means they are investing in at least some companies they know. But they could be missing out. The UK stockmarket has not performed particularly well over the last two years, and investors would have been better off putting their money in the US or Europe. So how do you know which market is going to perform best in the future? One of the easiest ways is to buy an investment trust that invests globally and spreads your money all round the world. The global growth trusts, previously known as international generalists, are some of the oldest and largest in the investment trust industry. The granddaddy of them all is Foreign &amp; Colonial, which was set up in 1868 to give smaller investors easy, low-cost access to overseas stockmarkets. It is still fulfilling the same role nowadays. 'In many ways these trusts were ahead of their time,' says Peter Walls of stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe. 'Today everybody is talking about globalisation and the need for investors to think more internationally. These trusts have always had that perspective.' What you get with a global growth investment trust is a 'one-stop shop'. As Robert Graham of Dunfermline-based independent financial advisers Scottish Financial Independence points out: 'You have a complete investment portfolio in one trust.' They are typically invested around 50 per cent in the UK and the rest overseas. Having such a diversified investment helps to reduce your risk. If some economies are performing poorly, the chances are this will be offset by growth elsewhere. For any investor concerned about the volatility of shares, the very longevity of these global growth giants must be reassuring. They have survived world wars, depressions and numerous bull and bear markets. There are 33 global growth trusts which adopt a variety of different approaches to achieve their objectives. This is why if you are investing a large amount of money, a financial adviser might recommend that you choose more than one. Mark Dampier, head of research at Bristol-based advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Global growth trusts make fantastic core holdings. With a large investment, I would normally suggest a spread of five or six trusts so that you get a variety of investment styles.' Such differences can be seen among the four largest trusts: Foreign &amp; Colonial (\u00a33.2 billion), Witan (\u00a32.1bn) Alliance (\u00a32bn), Scottish Mortgage (\u00a31.9bn). Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, tends to invest more overseas than its counterparts. Fund manager Jeremy Tigue explains: 'We currently have 350 investments spread around 30 different countries. When the management team get together we decide where to invest on the basis of where we can find the most good stocks and good ideas.'But he stresses that any changes in geographical emphasis tend to take place on a gradual basis. Stockbroker Merrill Lynch points out differences between other trusts. Alliance, it says, is 'conservatively run' whereas Scottish Mortgage is 'prepared to take large asset allocation bets'. Alliance's investment manager Gavin Suggett is unabashed about his trust's reputation. He says: 'There is an element of truth in calling us \"dull and boring\". The fact is we manage the trust on the assumption that it is a core holding. Therefore, we don't want to give our investors any nasty surprises and, for this reason, we don't take any big bets.' Scottish Mortgage's more aggressive approach can sometimes produce volatility and, indeed, manager James Anderson was recently forced to apologise to shareholders after the trust fell in value earlier this year due to its over exposure to telecoms stocks. In general, though, global growth trusts tend to produce steady, long-term performance. Fund managers pay particular attention to getting good returns as these trusts are normally regarded as the group's flagship. Consistency is helped by the fact that they are usually a team effort. At Witan, where a new investment director James Robinson has recently taken over, the talents of the seven specialist investment managers from Henderson who will be working with him, as they did with his predecessor Christopher Clarke, are seen as a particular strength. Recent figures show that the trusts have generally kept pace with or outshone the FT-All Share Index but they rarely make it to the top of the charts as do more specialist trusts. But Mark Dampier, of Hargreaves Lansdown, sees it as a tortoise and hare race. He says: 'Sometimes specialist trusts shoot out in front but in the end it is often the global trusts, which have been making steady headway all along, that come out the real winners.' He points out that average returns of 12 per cent per annum are typical. Alliance's Gavin Suggett also emphasises the role of low management charges in contributing to the trusts' long-term success. Alliance has the lowest charges of any investment trust of a mere 0.13 per cent per annum but the other large international trusts do not charge much more. At Foreign &amp; Colonial total expenses are 0.42 per cent, while at Witan and Scottish Mortgage they are 0.34 per cent and 0.38 per cent respectively.",

      "body": "<b>Lucy Moore</b> <br> <p> <b> The Journals of Sylvia Plath </b> edited by <b> Karen V. Kukil</b> (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. </p> <p><b>Lewis Wolpert</b><br> </p> <p> <b> James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist</b> (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. <b> Hitler's Gift</b>, by<b> Jean Medawar and David Pyke</b> (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. </p> <p><b>Simon Jenkins</b><br> </p> <p> <b> White Teeth</b> (Random House) by <b> Zadie Smith </b> is funny and sad. <b> Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe</b> (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats <b> Andrew Rawnsley's </b> gossipy <b> Servants of the People </b> (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for <b> Gladwyn Turbutt's </b> four-volume <b> History of Derbyshire</b> (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. </p> <p><b>Barbara Trapido</b><br></p> <p> While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was <b> G\u00fcnther Grass's </b> time travelling, massively long <b> Too Far Afield </b> (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, <b> Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club </b> (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with <b> Romesh Gunesekera's </b> beautiful exile story, <b> The Sandglass </b> (Granta). </p> <p><b>Robert Harris</b><br> </p> <p> The latest selection from <b> Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics </b> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. </p> <p> <b> Graham Robb's Rimbaud</b> (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. <b> Penelope Fitzgerald</b>, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, <b> The Means of Escape </b> (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. </p> <p><b>Joan Bakewell</b><br>L </p> <p> <b> J. G. Ballard </b> has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now <b> Super-Cannes </b> (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, <b> Richard Holmes</b> is always interesting. <b> Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer</b> (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. <b> Experience</b> by <b> Martin Amis </b> (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. </p> <p><b> Zadie Smith</b><br> </p> <p> I choose <b> Martin Amis's </b> memoir <b> Experience</b> (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, <b> Edward Platt's </b> intimate biography of the A40, <b> Leadville </b> (Picador), for the same reason, and <b> Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</b> (Picador) because it kicks ass. </p> <p><b>Misha Glenny</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History </b> (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. <b> Night of Stone </b> (Granta) , <b> Catherine Merridale's </b> account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. <b> Kosovo: War and Revenge</b> (Yale), <b> Tim Judah's </b> reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. </p> <p><b>Nicci Gerard</b><br> </p> <p> In <b> The Human Stain </b> (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - <b> Philip Roth </b> manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, <b> Philip Pullman</b> published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, <b> The Amber Spyglass </b> (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. </p> <p><b>Christopher Frayling</b><br></p> <p> I particularly enjoyed <b> David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture</b> (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was <b> Thomas McGuane's</b> elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as <b> Some Horses </b> (The Lyons Press). </p> <p><b>Jonathan Meades</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Atomised</b> by <b> Michel Houllebecq </b> (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In<b> The Third Reich: A New History </b> (Macmillan), <b> Michael Burleigh</b> proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. </p> <p><b>Brenda Maddox</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan </b> (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous <b> Letters of Kingsley Amis</b> edited by <b> Zachary Leader </b> (HarperCollins). </p> <p> <b>Antony Holden</b><br> </p> <p> Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, <b> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</b> (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. <b> Martin Amis's</b> memoir <b> Experience</b> (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired <b> Miranda Seymour's</b> exhaustive biography of <b> Mary Shelley. </b> </p> <p><b>Charles Saumarez Smith</b><br></p> <p> My favourite book of the year is called <b> City Secrets: Rome</b> (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect <b> Robert Kahn</b>, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed <b> The Long Afternoon </b> (Sceptre), <b> Giles Waterfield's</b> dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. </p> <p><b>Jan Morris</b><br> </p> <p> In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed <b> Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes</b> (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also <b> Peter Ackroyd's </b> virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, <b> London: The Biography</b> (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by <b> Miles Bredin's</b> life of James Bruce, <b> The Pale Abyssinian</b> (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. </p> <p><b>Mary Riddell</b><br> </p> <p> As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed <b> Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters </b> (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. </p> <p> <b>Tom Paulin</b><br></p> <p> <b> Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies</b> (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). <b> Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language</b> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. </p> <p><b>Edna O'Brien</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Snow and Guilt </b> by <b> Giorgio Pressburger </b> (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for <b> The Journals of Sylvia Plath</b> (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. <b> Eilis Ni Dhuibhne</b> is the most gifted young Irish writer. In <b> The Pale Gold of Alaska</b> (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. </p> <p><b>George Steiner</b><br> </p> <p> My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is <b> Colin Thubron's In Siberia </b> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. </p> <p><b>Gita Sereny</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna</b> is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. <b> Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding </b> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with <b> Ian Kershaw's</b> two volumes of Hitler biography - <b> Hubris</b> and <b> Nemesis </b> (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved <b> Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin</b> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). <b> George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain</b> (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved <b> Kent Haruf 's Plainsong</b> and <b> Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love</b> (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read <b> Robert Harris's Archangel </b> (Arrow), <b> Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement </b> (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by <b> Michael Connelly</b> (Orion). </p> <p><b>Mavis Cheek</b><br> </p> <p> 'Not for horrid profs,' says <b> Frank Kermode </b> of his <b> Shakespeare's Language</b> (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called <b> Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship</b> (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With <b> The World's Smallest Unicorn</b> (Cape),<b> Shena Mackay </b> brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. </p> <p><b> A L Kennedy</b><br> </p> <p> This year <b> No Great Mischief</b> (Cape) made <b> Alasdair MacLeod's </b> position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. </p> <p><b>Terry Eagleton</b><br> </p> <p> Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time. To write the very best book on him to date is thus a remarkable achievement. <b> Ken Hirschkop's Mikhail Bakhtin: An Aesthetic for Democracy</b> (OUP) combines dogged work in the Russian archives with some brilliant insights to show Bakhtin's relevance to questions of politics and popular democracy today. </p> <p><b>Glen Baxter</b><br> </p> <p> My contenders for book of the year would have to include <b> Flick Knives and Forks</b> (Zillah Bell Contemporary Art) by <b> Anthony Earnshaw</b> - a collection of the great English surrealists' aphorisms spiced with black humour. My next choice would be <b> The Book of Leviathan</b> (Sort of Books) by <b> Peter Bleguad</b> which is funny, enigmatic and beautifully limned - what more could one ask? </p> <p><b>Hermione Lee</b> </p> <p> My book of the year is the <b> Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai</b> (Faber) edited by his friend <b> Ted Hughes</b> and by <b> Daniel Weissbort. </b> His wry, conversational poems - tender, humane and pragmatic - on war, love, memory, and the fierce history of his city, Jerusalem, are all the more moving now. I was also delighted by the dazzling stories of <b> Peter Ho Davies, Equal Love </b> (Granta) , and by <b> Mich\u00e8le Roberts's </b> deliciously sensual French novel, <b> The Looking Glass</b> (Virago). </p> <p> <b>Helen Dunmore</b><br> </p> <p> It's seven years since <b> Michael Donaghy</b> last published a poetry collection. Here, after a magical interval, is <b> Conjure</b> (Picador), his best book yet. Conjure takes all the Donaghy virtues - wit, clarity, breathtaking control of rhyme and rhythm - and adds a new intensity of feeling. </p> <p><b>David Hare</b><br> </p> <p> Why do women write about the recent past so much better than men? Only John Osborne has described the day before yesterday as skilfully as Barbara Skelton, Doris Lessing and Joan Wyndham. <b> Stet</b> (Granta), is a record of <b> Diana Athill's</b> years as an editor at Andre Deutsch. It's hard to believe that most of her authors came anywhere near Athill's own superb literary pitch. Over the internet you can order the American edition of <b> The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Volume 1 1920-1945</b> (New Directions) - essential reading for admirers of one of America's greatest dramatists </p> <p> <b>Emma Tennant</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Lorna Sage's Bad Blood </b> (Fourth Estate) is a deceptively simple account of a Second World War childhood in deepest Flintshire, which makes sense of the enormous and bewildering changes in society in the last century. </p> <p> <b>Michael Foot</b><br></p> <p> Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that <b> Rebecca West</b> was not one of the great women of the century. Her <b> Selected Letters</b>, edited by <b> Bonnie Kime Scott</b> (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions. She would have appreciated the latest of essays from her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, <b> Merlin Holland's The Oscar Wilde Anthology</b> (HarperCollins). And don't miss <b> Have You Forgotten Yet? The First World War Memoirs of C P Blacker</b>, edited by <b> John Blacker</b> (Pen and Sword Books ), an original, plain-spoken record of the First World War which confronts the reader fairly with the Siegfried Sassoon verdict on the whole affair. </p> <p><b>Adam Phillips</b><br> </p> <p> <b> R. F. Langley's Collected Poems</b> (Carcanet) has a new music of sense-making about it that is, in the way only poetry and music can be, like an illumination. <b> Larry Siedentop's Democracy In Europe</b> (Allen Lane, Penguin) has a remarkable clarity and exhilaration about something that runs the risk of becoming just another topic of debate. <b> Richard Lewontin</b> with <b> The Triple Helix </b> (Harvard) continues to be the scientist everyone should read. </p> <p><b>J G Ballard</b><br></p> <p> <b> In The Heart Of The Sea </b> by Nathaniel Philbrick (HarperCollins) is a deeply moving account of the sinking of the whale ship Essex , which inspired Melville's Moby Dick. Rammed by a sperm whale, the Essex sank three days later, and the survivors set out by boat for the South American coast, 4,000 miles away. Nathaniel Philbrick unsparingly describes their ordeal, a hellish descent into starvation and cannibalism. None the less, these desperate men emerge as heroes. </p> <p><b>Philip French</b><br></p> <p> <b> George Orwell</b> is possibly the greatest writer of the twentieth century and next year's major publishing event will be the paperback editions at affordable prices of the first three volumes of his complete essays, letters and diaries: <b> All Propaganda is Lies 1941-42</b>, <b> Keeping Our Little Corner Clean</b> and <b> Two Wasted Years 1943</b> (Secker &amp; Warburg). My three new favourites all address themselves to settling the business of the last century. <b> Douglas Dunn's </b> vivid book-length poem <b> The Donkey's Ears</b> (Faber), purports to be the letters home to his wife by the self-questioning flag engineer of the Russian fleet steaming from the Baltic to the East China Sea to be destroyed by the Japanese in May 1905. </p> <p> <b> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</b> (Cape) magnificently completes the informal trilogy about post-war America that Roth began with American Pastoral and I Married a Communist. My film choice is Christopher Frayling's <b> Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death </b> (Faber), a fascinating biography that locates a great director in the complex social and cultural context of twentieth-century Italy. </p> <p><b>Andrew Motion</b><br></p> <p> <b> Derek Mahon</b> has always been a busy reviser and re-presenter of his own work. His latest <b> Selected Poems</b> (Penguin) is his best shot yet at self-definition - a wonderfully varied, skilful and abundant book by a writer who is working at his formidable best. Wordsworth was a grand old tinkerer, too, and watching him chop and change is just one of the fascinations of <b> Juliet Barker's </b> enormous, and enormously sympathetic, biography <b> Wordsworth: A Life</b> (Viking). And yet another revision: the third edition of <b> Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan</b> (Cassell) - the best book there is on Dylan, now better than ever. </p> <p><b>Peter Conrad</b><br></p> <p> Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by <b> Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40</b> (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. </p> <p><b>Chris Patten</b><br></p> <p> <b> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</b> (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the <b> Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers</b> (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. </p> <p> <b>Cressida Connolly</b><br> </p> <p> The American <b> Rick Moody</b> is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, <b> Demonology</b> (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed <b> Kazuo Ishiguro's </b> extraordinary novel, <b> When We Were Orphans </b> (Faber). My best book of the year was <b> Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I </b> (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And <b> John Burnside </b> 's new poems, the <b> Asylum Dance</b> (Cape), are pretty good, too. </p> <p><b>Steven Berkoff</b><br> </p> <p> In characteristic style <b> Peter Ackroyd </b> pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in <b> London: The Biography</b> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. </p> <p> <b> A Positively Final Appearance </b> (Penguin) affords another view of London. <b> Alec Guinness </b> 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice. A man of consummate taste and culture, he epitomises England, an England unfamiliar to us now but which still surrounds Guinness like a bubble. His reading is Trollope and Anthony Powell, while for comfort he quotes from Montaigne, but all so unpretentiously. This is an actor's actor, a man of culture, breeding and even a defined morality. </p> <p><b>Martin Amis</b><br> </p> <p> Fiction: <b> Saul Bellow's Ravelstein </b> (Penguin).

      "bodyText": "Lucy Moore The Journals of Sylvia Plath edited by Karen V. Kukil (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. Lewis Wolpert James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. Hitler's Gift, by Jean Medawar and David Pyke (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. Simon Jenkins White Teeth (Random House) by Zadie Smith is funny and sad. Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats Andrew Rawnsley's gossipy Servants of the People (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for Gladwyn Turbutt's four-volume History of Derbyshire (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. Barbara Trapido While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was G\u00fcnther Grass's time travelling, massively long Too Far Afield (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with Romesh Gunesekera's beautiful exile story, The Sandglass (Granta). Robert Harris The latest selection from Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. Graham Robb's Rimbaud (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. Penelope Fitzgerald, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, The Means of Escape (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. Joan Bakewell L J. G. Ballard has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now Super-Cannes (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, Richard Holmes is always interesting. Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. Experience by Martin Amis (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. Zadie Smith I choose Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, Edward Platt's intimate biography of the A40, Leadville (Picador), for the same reason, and Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador) because it kicks ass. Misha Glenny Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. Night of Stone (Granta) , Catherine Merridale's account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale), Tim Judah's reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. Nicci Gerard In The Human Stain (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - Philip Roth manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, Philip Pullman published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, The Amber Spyglass (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. Christopher Frayling I particularly enjoyed David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was Thomas McGuane's elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as Some Horses (The Lyons Press). Jonathan Meades Atomised by Michel Houllebecq (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan), Michael Burleigh proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. Brenda Maddox Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous Letters of Kingsley Amis edited by Zachary Leader (HarperCollins). Antony Holden Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired Miranda Seymour's exhaustive biography of Mary Shelley. Charles Saumarez Smith My favourite book of the year is called City Secrets: Rome (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect Robert Kahn, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed The Long Afternoon (Sceptre), Giles Waterfield's dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. Jan Morris In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also Peter Ackroyd's virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by Miles Bredin's life of James Bruce, The Pale Abyssinian (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. Mary Riddell As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. Tom Paulin Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. Edna O'Brien Snow and Guilt by Giorgio Pressburger (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for The Journals of Sylvia Plath (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. Eilis Ni Dhuibhne is the most gifted young Irish writer. In The Pale Gold of Alaska (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. George Steiner My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is Colin Thubron's In Siberia (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. Gita Sereny Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with Ian Kershaw's two volumes of Hitler biography - Hubris and Nemesis (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved Kent Haruf 's Plainsong and Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read Robert Harris's Archangel (Arrow), Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by Michael Connelly (Orion). Mavis Cheek 'Not for horrid profs,' says Frank Kermode of his Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With The World's Smallest Unicorn (Cape), Shena Mackay brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. A L Kennedy This year No Great Mischief (Cape) made Alasdair MacLeod's position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. Terry Eagleton Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time. To write the very best book on him to date is thus a remarkable achievement. Ken Hirschkop's Mikhail Bakhtin: An Aesthetic for Democracy (OUP) combines dogged work in the Russian archives with some brilliant insights to show Bakhtin's relevance to questions of politics and popular democracy today. Glen Baxter My contenders for book of the year would have to include Flick Knives and Forks (Zillah Bell Contemporary Art) by Anthony Earnshaw - a collection of the great English surrealists' aphorisms spiced with black humour. My next choice would be The Book of Leviathan (Sort of Books) by Peter Bleguad which is funny, enigmatic and beautifully limned - what more could one ask? Hermione Lee My book of the year is the Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai (Faber) edited by his friend Ted Hughes and by Daniel Weissbort. His wry, conversational poems - tender, humane and pragmatic - on war, love, memory, and the fierce history of his city, Jerusalem, are all the more moving now. I was also delighted by the dazzling stories of Peter Ho Davies, Equal Love (Granta) , and by Mich\u00e8le Roberts's deliciously sensual French novel, The Looking Glass (Virago). Helen Dunmore It's seven years since Michael Donaghy last published a poetry collection. Here, after a magical interval, is Conjure (Picador), his best book yet. Conjure takes all the Donaghy virtues - wit, clarity, breathtaking control of rhyme and rhythm - and adds a new intensity of feeling. David Hare Why do women write about the recent past so much better than men? Only John Osborne has described the day before yesterday as skilfully as Barbara Skelton, Doris Lessing and Joan Wyndham. Stet (Granta), is a record of Diana Athill's years as an editor at Andre Deutsch. It's hard to believe that most of her authors came anywhere near Athill's own superb literary pitch. Over the internet you can order the American edition of The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Volume 1 1920-1945 (New Directions) - essential reading for admirers of one of America's greatest dramatists Emma Tennant Lorna Sage's Bad Blood (Fourth Estate) is a deceptively simple account of a Second World War childhood in deepest Flintshire, which makes sense of the enormous and bewildering changes in society in the last century. Michael Foot Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that Rebecca West was not one of the great women of the century. Her Selected Letters, edited by Bonnie Kime Scott (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions. She would have appreciated the latest of essays from her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Merlin Holland's The Oscar Wilde Anthology (HarperCollins). And don't miss Have You Forgotten Yet? The First World War Memoirs of C P Blacker, edited by John Blacker (Pen and Sword Books ), an original, plain-spoken record of the First World War which confronts the reader fairly with the Siegfried Sassoon verdict on the whole affair. Adam Phillips R. F. Langley's Collected Poems (Carcanet) has a new music of sense-making about it that is, in the way only poetry and music can be, like an illumination. Larry Siedentop's Democracy In Europe (Allen Lane, Penguin) has a remarkable clarity and exhilaration about something that runs the risk of becoming just another topic of debate. Richard Lewontin with The Triple Helix (Harvard) continues to be the scientist everyone should read. J G Ballard In The Heart Of The Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick (HarperCollins) is a deeply moving account of the sinking of the whale ship Essex , which inspired Melville's Moby Dick. Rammed by a sperm whale, the Essex sank three days later, and the survivors set out by boat for the South American coast, 4,000 miles away. Nathaniel Philbrick unsparingly describes their ordeal, a hellish descent into starvation and cannibalism. None the less, these desperate men emerge as heroes. Philip French George Orwell is possibly the greatest writer of the twentieth century and next year's major publishing event will be the paperback editions at affordable prices of the first three volumes of his complete essays, letters and diaries: All Propaganda is Lies 1941-42, Keeping Our Little Corner Clean and Two Wasted Years 1943 (Secker &amp; Warburg). My three new favourites all address themselves to settling the business of the last century. Douglas Dunn's vivid book-length poem The Donkey's Ears (Faber), purports to be the letters home to his wife by the self-questioning flag engineer of the Russian fleet steaming from the Baltic to the East China Sea to be destroyed by the Japanese in May 1905. Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) magnificently completes the informal trilogy about post-war America that Roth began with American Pastoral and I Married a Communist. My film choice is Christopher Frayling's Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death (Faber), a fascinating biography that locates a great director in the complex social and cultural context of twentieth-century Italy. Andrew Motion Derek Mahon has always been a busy reviser and re-presenter of his own work. His latest Selected Poems (Penguin) is his best shot yet at self-definition - a wonderfully varied, skilful and abundant book by a writer who is working at his formidable best. Wordsworth was a grand old tinkerer, too, and watching him chop and change is just one of the fascinations of Juliet Barker's enormous, and enormously sympathetic, biography Wordsworth: A Life (Viking). And yet another revision: the third edition of Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan (Cassell) - the best book there is on Dylan, now better than ever. Peter Conrad Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40 (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. Chris Patten Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. Cressida Connolly The American Rick Moody is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, Demonology (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed Kazuo Ishiguro's extraordinary novel, When We Were Orphans (Faber). My best book of the year was Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And John Burnside 's new poems, the Asylum Dance (Cape), are pretty good, too. Steven Berkoff In characteristic style Peter Ackroyd pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. A Positively Final Appearance (Penguin) affords another view of London. Alec Guinness 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice. A man of consummate taste and culture, he epitomises England, an England unfamiliar to us now but which still surrounds Guinness like a bubble. His reading is Trollope and Anthony Powell, while for comfort he quotes from Montaigne, but all so unpretentiously. This is an actor's actor, a man of culture, breeding and even a defined morality. Martin Amis Fiction: Saul Bellow's Ravelstein (Penguin). Non-fiction: Inside Stalin's Russia: The Diaries of Reader Bullard, 1930-1934 edited by Julian and Margaret Bullard (Day Books).

      "body": "<p>However much your employer sings the praises of its employee share scheme, you should take a long, hard look before you leap. Many people have done well from such schemes over recent years, but the period has also seen spectacular gains from the stock market in general and certain sectors in particular. </p> <p>If we head into a dull period, employee share ownership may not be a certain bet for profits. Mergers may also take a toll on schemes. Employees may be forced to exercise their options and sell or take their savings. </p> <p>Asda's scheme survived the Wal-Mart takeover, but employees now receive Wal-Mart's US shares when their schemes mature. Diane Hay, chief executive of ProShare, says: 'Asda has done a lot to help employees cope and has set up effective dealing arrangements, but it's a problem.' </p> <p>Here are some questions you should ask yourself, or employer, before you decide.</p> <p><strong> What will I have to pay for the shares and can I afford it? </strong><br> 'If an employer is offering free shares it is basically a no-brainer,' says Hay. But you need to think more carefully if you are being asked to buy shares. For lower-paid employees, in particular, an SAYE scheme may be more attractive than an Aesop (all-employee share-ownership plan) because you can take cash out with no risk to the capital. </p> <p><strong> What are the risks? </strong><br> If you are buying, or receiving free shares, you must accept the possibility that their value could fall. Those with share options in some hi-tech companies have learned this the hard way. </p> <p>Hay says: 'You need to think about the wider financial position, as to whether it is a good thing for you to have your only investment as shares in your employer. You have got the job, your pension and any spare cash in your employer. If that company goes belly-up you have lost everything. You would have been better off putting your money in a unit trust or Isa.' </p> <p>Fred Hackworth, at the Employee Share Ownership Centre, says that if, under an Aesop scheme, the employer matches the shares that the employee offers to buy, the risk of losing money is much reduced. </p> <p><strong> Does it matter how long I will work for the company? </strong><br> If you withdraw from plans early you are likely to lose the tax breaks available and may have to pull out before becoming eligible for shares. You need to be committed to a company for at least three years and possibly five. If you receive free shares under an Aesop you may have to forfeit them if you leave within three years of the date the shares were awarded. </p> <p><strong> How easy will it be to sell the shares?</strong><br> If you work for a large company quoted on the stock market, this should not be a problem. But in smaller companies, particularly private ones, it may be difficult to obtain a buyer. Some organisations arrange to sell shares to willing buyers; oth ers will be planning a stock-market flotation. Rose Edmunds, at accountant Grant Thornton, says: 'Where employees are putting their hands in their pockets to buy shares they need to be asking searching questions about how they can realise the value of their shares.' </p> <p><strong> What if I have to pull out early? </strong><br> Under Aesop no tax is payable if you have to pull out because of redundancy, injury or disability. </p> <p><strong> Anything else I should be aware of? </strong><br> If you are receiving, or expect to receive, certain benefits including maternity benefit, industrial-injuries benefit and working families tax credit the new Aesop could disqualify you. </p> <p>\u0095 The Inland Revenue leaflet IR177, available from local tax offices, explains the situation in detail.</p>",

      "bodyText": "However much your employer sings the praises of its employee share scheme, you should take a long, hard look before you leap. Many people have done well from such schemes over recent years, but the period has also seen spectacular gains from the stock market in general and certain sectors in particular. If we head into a dull period, employee share ownership may not be a certain bet for profits. Mergers may also take a toll on schemes. Employees may be forced to exercise their options and sell or take their savings. Asda's scheme survived the Wal-Mart takeover, but employees now receive Wal-Mart's US shares when their schemes mature. Diane Hay, chief executive of ProShare, says: 'Asda has done a lot to help employees cope and has set up effective dealing arrangements, but it's a problem.' Here are some questions you should ask yourself, or employer, before you decide. What will I have to pay for the shares and can I afford it? 'If an employer is offering free shares it is basically a no-brainer,' says Hay. But you need to think more carefully if you are being asked to buy shares. For lower-paid employees, in particular, an SAYE scheme may be more attractive than an Aesop (all-employee share-ownership plan) because you can take cash out with no risk to the capital. What are the risks? If you are buying, or receiving free shares, you must accept the possibility that their value could fall. Those with share options in some hi-tech companies have learned this the hard way. Hay says: 'You need to think about the wider financial position, as to whether it is a good thing for you to have your only investment as shares in your employer. You have got the job, your pension and any spare cash in your employer. If that company goes belly-up you have lost everything. You would have been better off putting your money in a unit trust or Isa.' Fred Hackworth, at the Employee Share Ownership Centre, says that if, under an Aesop scheme, the employer matches the shares that the employee offers to buy, the risk of losing money is much reduced. Does it matter how long I will work for the company? If you withdraw from plans early you are likely to lose the tax breaks available and may have to pull out before becoming eligible for shares. You need to be committed to a company for at least three years and possibly five. If you receive free shares under an Aesop you may have to forfeit them if you leave within three years of the date the shares were awarded. How easy will it be to sell the shares? If you work for a large company quoted on the stock market, this should not be a problem. But in smaller companies, particularly private ones, it may be difficult to obtain a buyer. Some organisations arrange to sell shares to willing buyers; oth ers will be planning a stock-market flotation. Rose Edmunds, at accountant Grant Thornton, says: 'Where employees are putting their hands in their pockets to buy shares they need to be asking searching questions about how they can realise the value of their shares.' What if I have to pull out early? Under Aesop no tax is payable if you have to pull out because of redundancy, injury or disability. Anything else I should be aware of? If you are receiving, or expect to receive, certain benefits including maternity benefit, industrial-injuries benefit and working families tax credit the new Aesop could disqualify you. \u0095 The Inland Revenue leaflet IR177, available from local tax offices, explains the situation in detail.",

      "body": "<p>Last month workers at supermarket chain Asda celebrated profits of up to \u00a352,000 each from their employer. These payments were not bonuses, but the fruits of saving in Asda's employee share-ownership plan. The largest amounts went to employees who had saved \u00a3250 a month for five years. They profited to the tune of nearly 350 per cent over the life of their schemes, a staggering return. For people lucky enough to work for an employer who operates such a scheme, and where the share price is going in the right direction - Asda's was boosted by its takeover by US retailer Wal-Mart - this type of scheme represents one of the most attractive forms of investment around. </p> <p>A scheme that simultaneously encourages saving and employee loyalty is bound to fascinate a Government that reveres both. Hardly surprising then, that it wants to see many more people owning shares in the companies they work for. British industry has not embraced employee share ownership with the same gusto as counterparts in the US but the Government is campaigning to change this. At present around 3.5 million people belong to such schemes in the UK and the Government wants to double the number of companies offering the schemes, which should increase membership to around 4 million or 5 million over the next few years. </p> <p>There are already several schemes available although one of these, profit-related pay, is to be phased out and replaced by a new scheme announced in the last Budget. The all-employee share-ownership plan, or Aesop, is billed by its promoters as having the best tax breaks of any employee share scheme ever introduced in the UK. This is the scheme that the Government is counting on to significantly lift the popularity of employee share ownership and companies are beginning to launch Aesops now. About 170 have applied to the Inland Revenue to launch plans. </p> <p>The tax breaks on Aesops are generous; shares that employees buy from the schemes are purchased from pre-tax income and so there is no income tax or National Insurance to pay provided the shares are held for five years. If an employer gives shares to employees, these are also free of tax and NI. Potentially, the number of shares that can be swept up by employees is also generous. They can buy up to \u00a31,500 worth themselves, and employers can double that in the form of free 'matching' or 'partnership' shares. A company can, in addition, give up to \u00a33,000 of free shares, regardless of whether an employee has bought his or her own. </p> <p>Fred Hackworth, director of the Employee Share Ownership Centre, explains: 'Employees could end up with \u00a37,500 of shares in the first year, having spent only \u00a31,500 to get them.

It is important that it is made clear that the introduction of an employee share-ownership scheme should be part of an overall strategy to increase employee involvement.' </p> <p>Diane Hay, chief executive of ProShare, the organisation that promotes share own ership, agrees that installing an employee share scheme is not, on its own, enough to turn an unhappy, foot-dragging workforce into productive enthusiasts. </p> <p>Hay, who moved to ProShare from a job as an employee share-scheme specialist at the Inland Revenue, says the Esop must be part of a culture of open communications and generally good employee relations.

      "bodyText": "Last month workers at supermarket chain Asda celebrated profits of up to \u00a352,000 each from their employer. These payments were not bonuses, but the fruits of saving in Asda's employee share-ownership plan. The largest amounts went to employees who had saved \u00a3250 a month for five years. They profited to the tune of nearly 350 per cent over the life of their schemes, a staggering return. For people lucky enough to work for an employer who operates such a scheme, and where the share price is going in the right direction - Asda's was boosted by its takeover by US retailer Wal-Mart - this type of scheme represents one of the most attractive forms of investment around. A scheme that simultaneously encourages saving and employee loyalty is bound to fascinate a Government that reveres both. Hardly surprising then, that it wants to see many more people owning shares in the companies they work for. British industry has not embraced employee share ownership with the same gusto as counterparts in the US but the Government is campaigning to change this. At present around 3.5 million people belong to such schemes in the UK and the Government wants to double the number of companies offering the schemes, which should increase membership to around 4 million or 5 million over the next few years. There are already several schemes available although one of these, profit-related pay, is to be phased out and replaced by a new scheme announced in the last Budget. The all-employee share-ownership plan, or Aesop, is billed by its promoters as having the best tax breaks of any employee share scheme ever introduced in the UK. This is the scheme that the Government is counting on to significantly lift the popularity of employee share ownership and companies are beginning to launch Aesops now. About 170 have applied to the Inland Revenue to launch plans. The tax breaks on Aesops are generous; shares that employees buy from the schemes are purchased from pre-tax income and so there is no income tax or National Insurance to pay provided the shares are held for five years. If an employer gives shares to employees, these are also free of tax and NI. Potentially, the number of shares that can be swept up by employees is also generous. They can buy up to \u00a31,500 worth themselves, and employers can double that in the form of free 'matching' or 'partnership' shares. A company can, in addition, give up to \u00a33,000 of free shares, regardless of whether an employee has bought his or her own. Fred Hackworth, director of the Employee Share Ownership Centre, explains: 'Employees could end up with \u00a37,500 of shares in the first year, having spent only \u00a31,500 to get them. When you think about a 40 per cent tax payer, for example, you can see how advantageous that is.' Another key aspect of the Aesop is that employers can award shares according to the performance of employees. This could apply to the whole workforce or to individual groups; workers at one branch of a supermarket for example. The Government sees this aspect of its new scheme as part of its drive to improve productivity. Not all companies are expected to offer performance-related schemes.

      "body": "<p>This year's big idea has been the idea of how Big Ideas spread. The germ of it came from the New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell, whose book The Tipping Point, published last spring, investigated the process by which particular products became crazes, and who argued that these social trends mirrored the behaviour of diseases (in particular, happily, venereal diseases) - in that they were spread in the first instance by a promiscuous and energetic few, and, once they gained a hold in a small population, they grew exponentially. (At one moment, for example, a handful of goatee-bearded systems analysts in San Francisco took to riding to work on prototype silver micro-scooters designed by a Swiss eccentric; within a few months they were on the Christmas lists of the whole world.) </p> <p>Gladwell was fascinated by the precise moment at which a local outbreak of such ideas or trends 'tipped' and they became an epidemic, and by the optimum environment in which this 'tipping' might take place. </p> <p>Like all the best Big Ideas, this one came armed with a pseudoscientific rhetoric borrowed from a variety of sources that included Richard Dawkins's evolutionary biology (a fertile idea was a 'meme', an organism that grew stronger as it spread) and Yiddish folklore (a propagator of new ideas was a 'maven'). This nomenclature gave Gladwell's thesis a compelling kind of contemporary authority - but, still, anyone who can describe the intimate sales history of a particular kind of flip-flop in Los Angeles (or the curious trajectory of a word-of-mouth bestselling novel) in terms of the spread of syphilis in downtown Baltimore, is likely - in our brand and health-obsessed times - to give their idea, again to use Gladwell's term, 'stickiness'. </p> <p>One place where Gladwell's word-of-mouth treatise stuck was under the bald pate of Seth Godin, a 40-year-old Californian who, in his own words, has been on the 'cutting edge of internet marketing since before there was an internet'. Godin, formerly a marketing vice-president at the dominant online portal Yahoo!, was a man who had long been in search of a Big Idea - his previous books had included The Ultra Secrets of Game Boy Games and The E-Mail Addresses of the Rich and Famous as well as the bestselling Permission Marketing. When he read The Tipping Point , he says, many of the thoughts which had preoccupied him about the growth of new technology suddenly coalesced into a one large contagious-feeling idea: an 'ideavirus'. </p> <p>In 30 days he had written a book, Unleashing the Ideavirus, which gave practical application to Gladwell's theorising. Godin posted his book on the internet in August: it has since been downloaded by more than a million people - many of them, you imagine, alarmed publishers - making it the fastest-spreading virtual book ever, and, probably, extraordinarily, one of this autumn's best-read book of any kind. </p> <p>One of the selling points of Godin's idea - which differentiates it from most other business books - is that it puts its money where its mouth is. Godin's notion of the ideavirus suggests that our future will resemble one vast global Tupperware party. Products (which in his terms are interchangeable with 'ideas') will be sold less and less through traditional means of advertising and more and more by word-of-mouth recommendations and gossip. His book, launched with no advertising budget, is a paradigm of that process; it offers readers easy ways to send the book to their friends, and it keeps a running total of such referrals, currently more than 80 per cent. He describes this with typical unabashed corporate cheesiness as 'word of mouse'. </p> <p>The idea of 'viral marketing' is not a new one, of course: the term itself was coined by Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who invested in the free e-mail service Hotmail, and who used it to describe the fact that every single email you sent using its service also spread the word about Hotmail itself: 'Get your private, free email from Hotmail at <a href=\"http://www.hotmail.com'\">www.hotmail.com</a>' read a line at the foot of your message (both alerting your friends to the availability of this product, and enhancing your status as someone at the sharp end). </p> <p>Godin has extended this souped-up notion of consumer chatter into a manifesto. Point one of this document for our times reads: 'We used to focus on making food. We used to make stuff. Now we make ideas.' (Godin himself is a case in point. His father runs a company making hospital beds; he flogs slogans to CEOs.) Like a latter-day prophet, he sees parables of this vision wherever he looks: a book shop thus becomes 'the home of ideaviruses waiting to happen'; the stock market 'is nothing but thousands of possible ideaviruses'; and religion is the most pernicious ideavirus of all. (Godin cites the Hare Krishna habit of inviting potential converts to share a meal with them as classic viral marketing and points to the Shakers as the only known cult which made no effort to convert new members by word of mouth: 'And how many Shakers are there now?') </p> <p>One of the preconditions of this new marketplace is the slow death of conventional - what Godin calls 'interruption' - advertising. 'It is no longer possible,' he contends, 'to buy yourself a share of the market with a big TV ad budget.' You can see, he suggests, the acceptance of this fact in the way that ads are sprouting up on the floors of the supermarket, in the centre circles of football pitches and even in urinals. Billboards are no longer guaranteed to hold our attention; there are too many new things competing for it. </p> <p>In the absence of us listening to corporations telling us what to buy, Godin argues we will increasingly take our leads from a global community of opinion formers. He points to the fact that Amazon now not only ranks and grades its reviews, but also its reviewers (the most trusted, currently, is a woman named Harriet Klausener, a retired librarian from New York, who arguably does as much to influence the book market as any number of author tours or book shop dump-bins). He argues, too, that a website like Epinions.com, where there are millions of consumer reviews of everything from washing machines to dildos, is the shape of the future. </p> <p>The success of a film like The Blair Witch Project is of, course, a powerful argument for Godin's prophecy; so too is the \u00a35 handmade parody George Lucas in Love which is currently outselling the new Star Wars movie on video at Amazon. How is this possible? 'Because the parody is an ideavirus. And because the medium of the net is the perfect place for the word to spread,' Godin says. </p> <p>Word of mouth has, of course, always been a key factor in the spread of trends, but Godin argues that what we are seeing now, and are about to see, is a huge acceleration of that power; partly this is due to the fact that we are more receptive than ever to 'newness'. 'It used to be that only a few stereotypical nerds cared about the latest pocket calculator,' he suggests. 'Today, you'll see people talking about their hand-held computer on the subway. It used to be that only a few people knew about the latest salsa hit out of Mexico or the coolest new chef in Los Angeles. Today, the roles are totally reversed. Your parents are nerds!' </p> <p>The key people in this overdeveloped economy of nerds are - and, Godin has a lexicon of his own, of course - 'fashion editors': those who seem to have an innate sense for knowing when a 'hive' is ready to adopt a new virus. (Successful venture capitalists, journalists, chefs are all 'great fashion editors'). And once the 'hive' has that virus - be it the fact that is is 'cool' to have embroidery on your jeans, or tattoos on your shoulders, or to eat wraps instead of sandwiches, or have a palm-held computer instead of a Filofax - it is spread by 'sneezers'. Sneezers are people within the hive whose opinions we trust. High-profile examples might be Jamie Oliver or Delia Smith; Jeremy Paxman or Craig David. ('Oprah Winfrey is quite probably,' says Godin, 'the most successful sneezer of her generation.') But they might also be our friends, people we know or look up to and trust. </p> <p>To try to harness this tell-a-friend power, many 'idea merchants', corporations, are attempting to nurture ideaviruses by providing a multitude of pass-it-on tools, as well as offering overt rewards for becoming a sneezer. This kind of marketing has been pioneered by the powerful youth-oriented brands such as Nike and Tommy Hilfiger (some of the more invidious of these techniques, the attempted 'conquest of cool', are the primary subject of Naomi Klein's pivotal book, No Logo, and Thomas Frank's forthcoming One Market Under God ). These companies are well aware that the most fertile places for the spread of viruses are, of course, school playgrounds and college student unions - one of the implications of Godin's book is that increasingly corporations will be focusing marketing efforts on identifying 'promiscuous sneezers' in these groups, and attempt to replicate the classic viral epidemics of Harry Potter, Pok\u00e9mon or Napster (the pirate music site, which spread from an American college campus). </p> <p>On a local level this is already happening. Reggie Styles, for example, is the 23-year-old marketing director of an organisation called the Media Street Network, which runs a series of 'street teams', primarily for major record labels, across this country. Recruits to Styles's street teams - his sneezers - are drawn from the 'most kicking' of young urban populations by word of mouth. They are not paid, but they get to enjoy a 'Champagne Charlie' lifestyle, meeting their favourite rap stars, having access to the 'coolest gear and CDs'. In return they then go out to 'blitz' clubs by making the most noise when a track by a client's rap star is played (clients include corporate giants such as EMI); or they hang out at school gates and spread the word about a particular 'happening' group. 'Record companies,' say Styles, 'only know how to market S Club 7. They know nothing about the urban market.' </p> <p>And increasingly this principle, Styles believes, will spread beyond music, to clothes and video games and chocolate bars and electronics and books. 'The branded stuff will be the next big thing for us,' Styles explains. 'It's already hitting in the States.' </p> <p>So if, say, Reggie Styles came across a very cool kid in a school, someone who was popular with their peers, a potential sneezer, what would he do? </p> <p>'Oh, we'd hit them off,' he says: that is, give them records, posters, stickers (and, depending on the client, clothes, games, sports gear) in the belief that they will influence their peer group, or the parents of their peer group, to buy the things they are wearing. 'If these kids see some big corporation on the TV telling them to buy something, they're probably not going to buy it,' says Styles. 'They can see through that message. But if the message comes from someone they respect, someone they look up to, then they are going to want the record or the gear or whatever. G-Shock watches are really cool right now, everyone wants one,' says Styles. 'And anything by Nokia.' </p> <p>In many ways hand-held technologies are the key to viral marketing. And on the basis of the old principle that the medium is the message, organisations like the Media Street Network are increasingly using mobile phones to spread the word among young target markets. It is easy to see how such a strategy might be successful. The latest edition of Kids Marketing Report suggests that 61 per cent of 8-14 year olds have mobile phones, and 85 per cent of them send at least one, and often as many as 25 text messages every day. Give them something that is 'cool' to forward to their friends - a piece of gossip about a pop star, news of the latest singles releases or video game - and it's not hard to imagine how that gossip might become an epidemic. </p> <p>Seth Godin believes that the techniques of marketers like Styles are the future, and not just for the youth market. 'In the old days, we used to sneer at this kind of thing and and call it a fad,' he says. 'Today, everything from presidential politics to music to dentistry is driven by fads, which move faster than ever - and success belongs to marketers who embrace this fact.' </p> <p>Given his own Big Idea, Godin has, of course, become an important sneezer himself in the past few months. He is very aware that his power as a sneezer would be diminished if he is seen to be endorsing products rather than ideas, so he restricts himself instead to making 'about 50 speeches a year to corporate clients_ I get a thrill,' he says, 'out of shaking things up a little.' </p> <p>And what, I wonder, is the look on the faces of the board members as he tells them their business strategy is obsolete? </p> <p>Godin laughs. 'Oh, fear mostly,' he says. </p> <p> \u0095 Unleashing the Ideavirus by Seth Godin is published at <a href=\"http://www.ideavirus.com\">www.ideavirus.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "This year's big idea has been the idea of how Big Ideas spread. The germ of it came from the New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell, whose book The Tipping Point, published last spring, investigated the process by which particular products became crazes, and who argued that these social trends mirrored the behaviour of diseases (in particular, happily, venereal diseases) - in that they were spread in the first instance by a promiscuous and energetic few, and, once they gained a hold in a small population, they grew exponentially. (At one moment, for example, a handful of goatee-bearded systems analysts in San Francisco took to riding to work on prototype silver micro-scooters designed by a Swiss eccentric; within a few months they were on the Christmas lists of the whole world.) Gladwell was fascinated by the precise moment at which a local outbreak of such ideas or trends 'tipped' and they became an epidemic, and by the optimum environment in which this 'tipping' might take place. Like all the best Big Ideas, this one came armed with a pseudoscientific rhetoric borrowed from a variety of sources that included Richard Dawkins's evolutionary biology (a fertile idea was a 'meme', an organism that grew stronger as it spread) and Yiddish folklore (a propagator of new ideas was a 'maven'). This nomenclature gave Gladwell's thesis a compelling kind of contemporary authority - but, still, anyone who can describe the intimate sales history of a particular kind of flip-flop in Los Angeles (or the curious trajectory of a word-of-mouth bestselling novel) in terms of the spread of syphilis in downtown Baltimore, is likely - in our brand and health-obsessed times - to give their idea, again to use Gladwell's term, 'stickiness'. One place where Gladwell's word-of-mouth treatise stuck was under the bald pate of Seth Godin, a 40-year-old Californian who, in his own words, has been on the 'cutting edge of internet marketing since before there was an internet'. Godin, formerly a marketing vice-president at the dominant online portal Yahoo!, was a man who had long been in search of a Big Idea - his previous books had included The Ultra Secrets of Game Boy Games and The E-Mail Addresses of the Rich and Famous as well as the bestselling Permission Marketing. When he read The Tipping Point , he says, many of the thoughts which had preoccupied him about the growth of new technology suddenly coalesced into a one large contagious-feeling idea: an 'ideavirus'. In 30 days he had written a book, Unleashing the Ideavirus, which gave practical application to Gladwell's theorising. Godin posted his book on the internet in August: it has since been downloaded by more than a million people - many of them, you imagine, alarmed publishers - making it the fastest-spreading virtual book ever, and, probably, extraordinarily, one of this autumn's best-read book of any kind. One of the selling points of Godin's idea - which differentiates it from most other business books - is that it puts its money where its mouth is. Godin's notion of the ideavirus suggests that our future will resemble one vast global Tupperware party. Products (which in his terms are interchangeable with 'ideas') will be sold less and less through traditional means of advertising and more and more by word-of-mouth recommendations and gossip. His book, launched with no advertising budget, is a paradigm of that process; it offers readers easy ways to send the book to their friends, and it keeps a running total of such referrals, currently more than 80 per cent. He describes this with typical unabashed corporate cheesiness as 'word of mouse'. The idea of 'viral marketing' is not a new one, of course: the term itself was coined by Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who invested in the free e-mail service Hotmail, and who used it to describe the fact that every single email you sent using its service also spread the word about Hotmail itself: 'Get your private, free email from Hotmail at www.hotmail.com' read a line at the foot of your message (both alerting your friends to the availability of this product, and enhancing your status as someone at the sharp end). Godin has extended this souped-up notion of consumer chatter into a manifesto. Point one of this document for our times reads: 'We used to focus on making food. We used to make stuff. Now we make ideas.' (Godin himself is a case in point. His father runs a company making hospital beds; he flogs slogans to CEOs.) Like a latter-day prophet, he sees parables of this vision wherever he looks: a book shop thus becomes 'the home of ideaviruses waiting to happen'; the stock market 'is nothing but thousands of possible ideaviruses'; and religion is the most pernicious ideavirus of all. (Godin cites the Hare Krishna habit of inviting potential converts to share a meal with them as classic viral marketing and points to the Shakers as the only known cult which made no effort to convert new members by word of mouth: 'And how many Shakers are there now?') One of the preconditions of this new marketplace is the slow death of conventional - what Godin calls 'interruption' - advertising. 'It is no longer possible,' he contends, 'to buy yourself a share of the market with a big TV ad budget.' You can see, he suggests, the acceptance of this fact in the way that ads are sprouting up on the floors of the supermarket, in the centre circles of football pitches and even in urinals. Billboards are no longer guaranteed to hold our attention; there are too many new things competing for it. In the absence of us listening to corporations telling us what to buy, Godin argues we will increasingly take our leads from a global community of opinion formers. He points to the fact that Amazon now not only ranks and grades its reviews, but also its reviewers (the most trusted, currently, is a woman named Harriet Klausener, a retired librarian from New York, who arguably does as much to influence the book market as any number of author tours or book shop dump-bins). He argues, too, that a website like Epinions.com, where there are millions of consumer reviews of everything from washing machines to dildos, is the shape of the future. The success of a film like The Blair Witch Project is of, course, a powerful argument for Godin's prophecy; so too is the \u00a35 handmade parody George Lucas in Love which is currently outselling the new Star Wars movie on video at Amazon. How is this possible? 'Because the parody is an ideavirus. And because the medium of the net is the perfect place for the word to spread,' Godin says. Word of mouth has, of course, always been a key factor in the spread of trends, but Godin argues that what we are seeing now, and are about to see, is a huge acceleration of that power; partly this is due to the fact that we are more receptive than ever to 'newness'. 'It used to be that only a few stereotypical nerds cared about the latest pocket calculator,' he suggests. 'Today, you'll see people talking about their hand-held computer on the subway. It used to be that only a few people knew about the latest salsa hit out of Mexico or the coolest new chef in Los Angeles. Today, the roles are totally reversed. Your parents are nerds!' The key people in this overdeveloped economy of nerds are - and, Godin has a lexicon of his own, of course - 'fashion editors': those who seem to have an innate sense for knowing when a 'hive' is ready to adopt a new virus. (Successful venture capitalists, journalists, chefs are all 'great fashion editors'). And once the 'hive' has that virus - be it the fact that is is 'cool' to have embroidery on your jeans, or tattoos on your shoulders, or to eat wraps instead of sandwiches, or have a palm-held computer instead of a Filofax - it is spread by 'sneezers'. Sneezers are people within the hive whose opinions we trust. High-profile examples might be Jamie Oliver or Delia Smith; Jeremy Paxman or Craig David. ('Oprah Winfrey is quite probably,' says Godin, 'the most successful sneezer of her generation.') But they might also be our friends, people we know or look up to and trust. To try to harness this tell-a-friend power, many 'idea merchants', corporations, are attempting to nurture ideaviruses by providing a multitude of pass-it-on tools, as well as offering overt rewards for becoming a sneezer. This kind of marketing has been pioneered by the powerful youth-oriented brands such as Nike and Tommy Hilfiger (some of the more invidious of these techniques, the attempted 'conquest of cool', are the primary subject of Naomi Klein's pivotal book, No Logo, and Thomas Frank's forthcoming One Market Under God ). These companies are well aware that the most fertile places for the spread of viruses are, of course, school playgrounds and college student unions - one of the implications of Godin's book is that increasingly corporations will be focusing marketing efforts on identifying 'promiscuous sneezers' in these groups, and attempt to replicate the classic viral epidemics of Harry Potter, Pok\u00e9mon or Napster (the pirate music site, which spread from an American college campus). On a local level this is already happening. Reggie Styles, for example, is the 23-year-old marketing director of an organisation called the Media Street Network, which runs a series of 'street teams', primarily for major record labels, across this country. Recruits to Styles's street teams - his sneezers - are drawn from the 'most kicking' of young urban populations by word of mouth. They are not paid, but they get to enjoy a 'Champagne Charlie' lifestyle, meeting their favourite rap stars, having access to the 'coolest gear and CDs'. In return they then go out to 'blitz' clubs by making the most noise when a track by a client's rap star is played (clients include corporate giants such as EMI); or they hang out at school gates and spread the word about a particular 'happening' group. 'Record companies,' say Styles, 'only know how to market S Club 7. They know nothing about the urban market.' And increasingly this principle, Styles believes, will spread beyond music, to clothes and video games and chocolate bars and electronics and books. 'The branded stuff will be the next big thing for us,' Styles explains. 'It's already hitting in the States.' So if, say, Reggie Styles came across a very cool kid in a school, someone who was popular with their peers, a potential sneezer, what would he do? 'Oh, we'd hit them off,' he says: that is, give them records, posters, stickers (and, depending on the client, clothes, games, sports gear) in the belief that they will influence their peer group, or the parents of their peer group, to buy the things they are wearing. 'If these kids see some big corporation on the TV telling them to buy something, they're probably not going to buy it,' says Styles. 'They can see through that message. But if the message comes from someone they respect, someone they look up to, then they are going to want the record or the gear or whatever. G-Shock watches are really cool right now, everyone wants one,' says Styles. 'And anything by Nokia.' In many ways hand-held technologies are the key to viral marketing. And on the basis of the old principle that the medium is the message, organisations like the Media Street Network are increasingly using mobile phones to spread the word among young target markets. It is easy to see how such a strategy might be successful. The latest edition of Kids Marketing Report suggests that 61 per cent of 8-14 year olds have mobile phones, and 85 per cent of them send at least one, and often as many as 25 text messages every day. Give them something that is 'cool' to forward to their friends - a piece of gossip about a pop star, news of the latest singles releases or video game - and it's not hard to imagine how that gossip might become an epidemic. Seth Godin believes that the techniques of marketers like Styles are the future, and not just for the youth market. 'In the old days, we used to sneer at this kind of thing and and call it a fad,' he says. 'Today, everything from presidential politics to music to dentistry is driven by fads, which move faster than ever - and success belongs to marketers who embrace this fact.' Given his own Big Idea, Godin has, of course, become an important sneezer himself in the past few months. He is very aware that his power as a sneezer would be diminished if he is seen to be endorsing products rather than ideas, so he restricts himself instead to making 'about 50 speeches a year to corporate clients_ I get a thrill,' he says, 'out of shaking things up a little.' And what, I wonder, is the look on the faces of the board members as he tells them their business strategy is obsolete? Godin laughs. 'Oh, fear mostly,' he says. \u0095 Unleashing the Ideavirus by Seth Godin is published at www.ideavirus.com",

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago a group of young French film critics, collectively dubbed La Nouvelle Vague, exploded on to the moviemaking scene, sending a cultural tidal wave around the world. They were considered radicals, but in truth only one of them, Jean-Luc Godard, who will be 70 next week, can be seen in retrospect to have been truly revolutionary. The others were mostly renewing traditional cinema. In a 1968 essay Susan Sontag declared: 'Godard is not merely an iconoclast. He is a deliberate \"destroyer\" of cinema', and she compared his breaking of established rules through jump cuts, inconsistent points of view and confused story lines, with Schoenberg's dispensing with tonality and the Cubists rejecting conventional pictorial space. He was the most intellectual member of the New Wave, though not necessarily the most intelligent. </p> <p>Godard was born in France of haute-bourgeois Swiss parents, his father a doctor, his mother the daughter of a wealthy banker. When the war broke out he was sent to live in Switzerland, and he returned to Paris in the late Forties to study ethnology at the Sorbonne. But he had been bitten by the movie bug, and along with his new friends - Claude Chabrol, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette - he devoted himself to watching movies and writing about them in a passionate, personal, complex manner for Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma and other magazines. When his family cut off his allowance for neglecting his studies, he supported himself by theft, and then took a job as a labourer on a Swiss dam, made a documentary on the project and sold it to the construction firm. </p> <p>Following the success of Chabrol's Le Beau Serge (1958) and Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups (1959), Godard's friends generously drew him into feature-filmmaking with A Bout de Souffle (1960) which was based on an idea by Truffaut and credits Chabrol as artistic supervisor. With its B-feature crime plot, hand-held camerawork and natural lighting, references to Sam Fuller and Humphrey Bogart, quotations from Faulkner and Apollinaire, and an opening dedication to the Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures, there had never been anything like it. It also had striking performances from the well-known Jean Seberg, whose career it revived, and the unknown Jean-Paul Belmondo, whom it made a star. Godard was to work consistently with major names over the next 30-odd years, but he never had another box-office hit. </p> <p>In the early 1960s Godard was the world's most discussed, interviewed and quoted film-maker, and his appearance (the blue chin, the receding hair, the opaque dark glasses) became familiar the world over. Sayings of his entered the language, among them 'the cinema is the truth 24 times a second' and 'I agree that a film should have a beginning, a middle and an end but not necessarily in that order'. His second picture, The Little Soldier, dealt with the Algerian War and was temporarily banned, the first in a string of controversies. In eight years he made 14 films, most photographed by the great cameraman Raoul Coutard. Some early ones star his first wife, the attractive Danish actress Anna Karina; later ones featured his second wife Anne Wiamensky, the dull niece of Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac. Deeply influenced by Brecht in the use of chapter headings and the 'alienation effect' by which you're kept aware that you're watching a movie, these pictures were a remarkable combination of intelligent invention and irritating childishness as they played games with established genres - science-fiction in Alphaville, the musical in Une Femme est Une Femme , the noir thriller in Made in America. </p> <p>Only one film started out as a commercial proposition - Le M\u00e9pris (1963), which was financed by the American tycoon Joseph E. Levine, who wanted a sexy art-house picture starring Brigitte Bardot. Godard, who loved American films as much as he hated the industry that produced them, deliberately shot Bardot's nude scenes unerotically and sent up Levine as the ignorant Hollywood mogul played by Jack Palance. </p> <p>Godard nearly got to make a feature in America when the authors of Bonnie and Clyde introduced him to their financial backers. They blanched when he said that shooting should start in three weeks and pointed out that the weather in Texas was unsuitable. 'I am speaking cinema and you are speaking meteorology,' he replied. What really made the producers back off was Godard's claim that 'we can make this film anywhere; we can make it in Tokyo'. Such was Godard's status at the time that the screenwriters, Robert Benton and David Newman, would have been happy to have him make it in Tokyo. </p> <p>Gradually in the 1960s Godard's characters turned from nihilistic outsiders to committed revolutionaries and the films became more determinedly, if callowly, political. After Weekend (1967), which bears the final title 'Fin du cin\u00e9ma', he withdrew into collective left-wing productions, but was still capable of attracting stars like Jane Fonda and Yves Montand. </p> <p>He later moved to Switzerland, his base for the last 20 years. There he's experimented with video, produced a gnomic eight-hour history of cinema, and made a succession of tedious, often deliberately incomprehensible pictures like the ridiculous Lear (Godard had never read Shakespeare's play). The contract for Lear was drawn up on a paper napkin at Cannes with Cannon Films, but its star, Norman Mailer, walked off the set after two days' shooting, and Woody Allen, who's supposed to be the Fool, is seen for a few silent seconds in a cutting room. His only picture of the past 20 years to receive a moderately widespread distribution was his controversial reworking of the virgin birth, Hail Mary (1984), which provoked the wrath of the Vatican, launched the career of Juliette Binoche, and bored most viewers rigid. </p> <p>If Truffaut's warm, humanistic films are about the death of people, Godard's cold, misanthropic movies are about the death of institutions, societies, civilisation. And there's something correspondingly chilly and despairing in the willed and wilful way he's deliberately cut himself off from colleagues and audiences through the obscurity and offensiveness of his movies and the callousness of his conduct. In Trevor Griffith's play The Party, the veteran Scottish Trotskyist Tagg tells a gathering of left-wing intellectuals in 1968: 'You enjoy biting the hand that feeds you, but you'll never bite it off'.</p> <p>Starting with Joe Levine, Godard has been trying to do just that. He had a fight with a producer on stage at the NFT; in 1968 he made a documentary called British Sounds for London Weekend Television that couldn't be shown, not because of its revolutionary politics, but because of its gratuitous full-frontal nudity; he deliberately provoked an irreparable rift with Truffaut. In 1973 he wrote an insulting letter about La Nuit Am\u00e9ricaine , attacking the film, accusing Truffaut of dishonesty, then asking Truffaut to co-produce and invest 10 million francs in his next film. He received a six-page reply that began: 'So you won't be obliged to read this unpleasant letter right to the end, I'm starting with the essential point: I will not co-produce your film.' Truffaut went on to list a succession of public and private offences, stating that 'you're nothing but a piece of shit on a pedestal'. </p> <p>The latest recipient of the Godard treatment is an American admirer, filmmaker Richard Brody, who was commissioned by the New Yorker to interview him at his office by Lake Geneva. After the first session he arrived at Godard's office the next day to be met by a note pinned to the door saying that Godard could not go on because 'it was not a real discussion', and also flou (unfocused). That night, Godard and Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville, his companion and collaborator for much of the past 30 years, were dining at the hotel were Brody was staying. Godard, hardly looking at him, 'emitted a chilling bonsoir'. After accepting the American's thanks for the time he'd given him, Godard wished him bon voyage, while Mi\u00e9ville looked him over and said nothing. </p> <p>\u0095 The National Film Theatre will be mounting a complete Godard retrospective next June and July, including an international conference on 21-24 June at Tate Modern. For details: <a href=\"http://www.forevergodard.com\">www.forevergodard.com</a>.</p> <p> <strong>The wisdom of Godard</strong></p> <p>'There is no point in having sharp images when you have fuzzy ideas.' </p> <p>'I don't think you should FEEL about a movie. You should feel about a woman. You can't kiss a movie.' </p> <p>'Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.' </p> <p>'All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.'</p> <p> <strong> The director's director</strong> </p> <p>Directors on whom Godard has had a major influence include: Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino. 'Tarantino named his production company [A Band Apart] after one of my films. He'd have done better to give me some money,' said Godard. </p> <p>'Godard is a constant source of inspiration. Before I do anything, I go back and look at as many of his films as I can, as a reminder of what's possible.' <strong> Steven Soderbergh</strong> </p> <p>'For me, discovering cinema was directly connected to his films. I was living in Paris at the time. When Made in USA opened, I went to the first show - it was around noon - and I sat there until midnight. I saw it six times in a row.' <strong> Wim Wenders</strong> </p> <p>'Godard is like an elite. It's not cinema anymore. It's Godard.' <strong> Jean-Jacques Beneix</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Three highs</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A Bout de Souffle</strong> (1960) </p> <p>The defining example of New Wave cinema which cemented his reputation and revived Jean Seberg's career. It was also his sole major box-office hit. </p> <p><strong> Pierrot le Fou</strong> (1965) </p> <p>A complex, riveting tale of two runaways - Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anne Karina - in the south of France. Reputedly shot without a script. </p> <p><strong> Vivre sa Vie</strong> (1962) </p> <p>A portrait of a prostitute (Anna Karina) recounted in 12 chapters. An insightful look at the relationship between the sexes. </p> <p> <strong> Three lows</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sympathy for the Devil</strong> (1968) </p> <p>Confusing rockumentary about the Rolling Stones. It contained some revealing footage of the band but Godard unwisely concentrated on distilling the revolutionary spirit of the era. </p> <p><strong> Hail Mary </strong> (1985) </p> <p>Controversial update with Juliette Binoche of the nativity story. Mary is a petrol-station attendant and Joseph her cabdriver boyfriend. Condemned by the Pope and the critics. </p> <p><strong> King Lear </strong> (1987) </p> <p>Godard didn't read the play before embarking on this experimental film based on the great tragedy.</p>",

He had a fight with a producer on stage at the NFT; in 1968 he made a documentary called British Sounds for London Weekend Television that couldn't be shown, not because of its revolutionary politics, but because of its gratuitous full-frontal nudity; he deliberately provoked an irreparable rift with Truffaut. In 1973 he wrote an insulting letter about La Nuit Am\u00e9ricaine , attacking the film, accusing Truffaut of dishonesty, then asking Truffaut to co-produce and invest 10 million francs in his next film. He received a six-page reply that began: 'So you won't be obliged to read this unpleasant letter right to the end, I'm starting with the essential point: I will not co-produce your film.' Truffaut went on to list a succession of public and private offences, stating that 'you're nothing but a piece of shit on a pedestal'. The latest recipient of the Godard treatment is an American admirer, filmmaker Richard Brody, who was commissioned by the New Yorker to interview him at his office by Lake Geneva. After the first session he arrived at Godard's office the next day to be met by a note pinned to the door saying that Godard could not go on because 'it was not a real discussion', and also flou (unfocused). That night, Godard and Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville, his companion and collaborator for much of the past 30 years, were dining at the hotel were Brody was staying. Godard, hardly looking at him, 'emitted a chilling bonsoir'. After accepting the American's thanks for the time he'd given him, Godard wished him bon voyage, while Mi\u00e9ville looked him over and said nothing. \u0095 The National Film Theatre will be mounting a complete Godard retrospective next June and July, including an international conference on 21-24 June at Tate Modern. For details: www.forevergodard.com. The wisdom of Godard 'There is no point in having sharp images when you have fuzzy ideas.' 'I don't think you should FEEL about a movie. You should feel about a woman. You can't kiss a movie.' 'Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.' 'All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.' The director's director Directors on whom Godard has had a major influence include: Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino. 'Tarantino named his production company [A Band Apart] after one of my films. He'd have done better to give me some money,' said Godard. 'Godard is a constant source of inspiration. Before I do anything, I go back and look at as many of his films as I can, as a reminder of what's possible.' Steven Soderbergh 'For me, discovering cinema was directly connected to his films. I was living in Paris at the time. When Made in USA opened, I went to the first show - it was around noon - and I sat there until midnight. I saw it six times in a row.' Wim Wenders 'Godard is like an elite. It's not cinema anymore. It's Godard.' Jean-Jacques Beneix Three highs A Bout de Souffle (1960) The defining example of New Wave cinema which cemented his reputation and revived Jean Seberg's career. It was also his sole major box-office hit. Pierrot le Fou (1965) A complex, riveting tale of two runaways - Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anne Karina - in the south of France. Reputedly shot without a script. Vivre sa Vie (1962) A portrait of a prostitute (Anna Karina) recounted in 12 chapters. An insightful look at the relationship between the sexes. Three lows Sympathy for the Devil (1968) Confusing rockumentary about the Rolling Stones. It contained some revealing footage of the band but Godard unwisely concentrated on distilling the revolutionary spirit of the era. Hail Mary (1985) Controversial update with Juliette Binoche of the nativity story. Mary is a petrol-station attendant and Joseph her cabdriver boyfriend. Condemned by the Pope and the critics. King Lear (1987) Godard didn't read the play before embarking on this experimental film based on the great tragedy.",

Research from the United States shows that its welfare-to-work schemes miss a hard core of about 10 per cent of their target audience - including lone parents who refuse to buckle under US benefit sanctions, drug addicts and rough sleepers. But programmes teaching the so-called 'four Rs' - not just reading, writing and arithmetic, but 'readiness for work' skills like communication or punctuality - before entering work have had some success in the US, offering a model for the UK. The standard New Deal will also emphasise 'work-readiness' skills to help candidates get better jobs with promotion prospects. A key theme for Labour's next term will be not just getting people into work regardless, but creating 'good' jobs where employees are trained and treated well.",

The scale of the problem has led to record compensation payouts.</p> <p>Since 1998 the Ministry of Defence has paid out more than \u00a320 million to 191 members of the armed forces, more than \u00a311,500 a year for each doctor employed in the Defence Medical Services.</p> <p>The total compensation has trebled since 1997 and is now six times higher than in the National Health Service, which last year paid out less than \u00a32,000 per doctor.</p> <p>For \u00a320m the MoD could have refurbished all the homes on a military base, upgraded 50,000 of its rifles or bought 10 Challenger battle tanks.</p> <p>Legal experts believe the rapidly dwindling number of medical specialists in the armed forces is one reason for the soaring number of medical blunders, with late and wrong diagnosis a major problem. The Defence Medical Services are losing more than 700 trained doctors, nurses and specialists a year.</p> <p>Two years ago, father-of-three Stephen Stewart died after developing skin cancer during a tour of duty in Belize with the former Queen's Own Highlanders Regiment.</p> <p>After suffering from severe sunburn, a mole on his neck began to bleed. An Army doctor confirmed the growth was malignant and it was surgically removed. Stewart was then given the all-clear, but after leaving the Army in 1997 he began to have pains in his neck, suffered a dramatic weight loss and began vomiting regularly.</p> <p>Doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and told him he had less than a year to live. His widow, Paula Stewart, is suing the MoD, claiming her husband was not given radiotherapy treatment after the cancer first appeared. Lawyers say that this amounted to a crucial lapse in care that would have prevented his premature death.</p> <p>Lesley Herbertson, head of clinical negligence at law firm Alexander Harris, claims that there is anecdotal evidence of soldiers being made to feel 'weak' if they complain of health problems.</p> <p>Herbertson has recently acted for a young soldier who had been complaining of chest problems that made it difficult for him to breathe. His medical unit dismissed his complaints and did not take a chest X-ray. Days later he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and required a major operation to save his life. The soldier was left with massive scars around his body and the MoD had to pay out \u00a320,000 in compensation.</p> <p>In another case, a soldier collapsed into a coma and was left with brain damage after being forced to go on a long run despite complaining of breathing difficulties. It turned out he had pleurisy.</p> <p>Families of soldiers are also having problems. Last July a Wiltshire family won more than \u00a32m in damages from the MoD after Army doctors in Aldershot failed to carry out a prompt Caesarean birth. The baby was left with cerebral palsy and cannot speak.</p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on defence, said: 'Those joining the armed services are entitled to expect the best when it comes to medical treatment. Without a proper standard of care, units could easily be left well short of their full complement, adding to the burdens of overstretch.</p> <p>'The Defence Medical Services are still paying a heavy price for the cack-handed reforms introduced under the last Conservative Government. But it is time the present administration put things right.'</p> <p>Earlier this year Admiral Sir John Brigstocke sparked a political row by writing of his concern about the 'parlous state' of the forces' medical service, complaining that the budget for the Surgeon-General's Department, which treats service personnel, had been cut by \u00a31.5m.</p> <p>In February, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body described manning levels as 'critically low, particularly in the numbers of deployable medical officers'. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, Britain's armed forces had been cut by a third, but the manpower strength of the Defence Medical Services had fallen by more than half.</p> <p>Last year the Commons Defence Select Committee reported a 30 per cent staff shortfall, with only 50 per cent of the necessary doctors and 75 per cent of the nurses.</p>",

Doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and told him he had less than a year to live. His widow, Paula Stewart, is suing the MoD, claiming her husband was not given radiotherapy treatment after the cancer first appeared. Lawyers say that this amounted to a crucial lapse in care that would have prevented his premature death. Lesley Herbertson, head of clinical negligence at law firm Alexander Harris, claims that there is anecdotal evidence of soldiers being made to feel 'weak' if they complain of health problems. Herbertson has recently acted for a young soldier who had been complaining of chest problems that made it difficult for him to breathe. His medical unit dismissed his complaints and did not take a chest X-ray. Days later he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and required a major operation to save his life. The soldier was left with massive scars around his body and the MoD had to pay out \u00a320,000 in compensation. In another case, a soldier collapsed into a coma and was left with brain damage after being forced to go on a long run despite complaining of breathing difficulties. It turned out he had pleurisy. Families of soldiers are also having problems. Last July a Wiltshire family won more than \u00a32m in damages from the MoD after Army doctors in Aldershot failed to carry out a prompt Caesarean birth. The baby was left with cerebral palsy and cannot speak. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on defence, said: 'Those joining the armed services are entitled to expect the best when it comes to medical treatment. Without a proper standard of care, units could easily be left well short of their full complement, adding to the burdens of overstretch. 'The Defence Medical Services are still paying a heavy price for the cack-handed reforms introduced under the last Conservative Government. But it is time the present administration put things right.' Earlier this year Admiral Sir John Brigstocke sparked a political row by writing of his concern about the 'parlous state' of the forces' medical service, complaining that the budget for the Surgeon-General's Department, which treats service personnel, had been cut by \u00a31.5m. In February, the Armed Forces Pay Review Body described manning levels as 'critically low, particularly in the numbers of deployable medical officers'. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, Britain's armed forces had been cut by a third, but the manpower strength of the Defence Medical Services had fallen by more than half. Last year the Commons Defence Select Committee reported a 30 per cent staff shortfall, with only 50 per cent of the necessary doctors and 75 per cent of the nurses.",

The two firms intend to make a 'declaration of renewed commitment' to each other next month and to their global Oneworld marketing alliance of airlines, after months of uncertainty while BA was attempting to buy Dutch airline KLM. American is keen to file a new application in Washington for anti-trust immunity for the two airlines and to negotiate with the competition authorities in London and Brussels for permission to collaborate on transatlatic prices and services. But BA is urging caution and a softly, softly approach, particularly to the European Commission, after disagree ments there in 1998 sank the previous plan for a full-blown partnership. Then, the airlines backed away from a Brussels demand that BA give up substantial capacity at Heathrow to allow in more competing US airlines. They believe they would have to give up much less capacity because the rival Star grouping, led by United Airlines and Lufthansa, is very powerful and now includes British Midland, which has significant capac ity at Heathrow. Sources close to Oneworld told The Observer that American had been ready to jettison BA from the alliance and switch its allegiance to Swissair if it had formed a tie up with KLM and the Dutch carrier's US partner, Northwest. But the BA-KLM talks ended in September without a deal. BA chief executive Rod Eddington and American chairman Don Carty will meet with the other Oneworld bosses in Atlanta this week.",

      "body": "<p><strong> BMW X5</strong><br> <strong> Price </strong>from \u00a333,000 <br> <strong>Insurance group </strong>16 <br> <strong>MPG </strong> 22.2 <br> <strong>Engine size</strong> 2979cc <br> <strong>Max speed </strong>128mph <br> <strong>0-60mph </strong>8.5 seconds <br> <strong>Driven wheels </strong> Rear 62:38</p> <p> Unless you live in a river, which, admittedly, more and more of us do these wintry days, buying a 4x4 is a heroically stupid thing to do. Off-roaders are big, stodgy, thirsty and drive like barges. You can't park them in town, you can't take off at the lights showing sports cars a clean pair of mud flaps and, worst off all, they are plain bad for your image. Choose a Jeep, and everyone thinks you're overcompensating madly for lack of performance 'off road'. The Mercedes is just too Annette Bening in American Beauty . The Lexus has no class. John Birt did for the Range Rover, and Land Rovers only make sense in the southern hemisphere. </p> <p>Mud-pluggers suffer from the same problem as Country Life . They reek of country piles, Harris Tweed, corduroy keks, wet dogs and wellies, but most people who buy them are 0207. The closest they get to mud is the odd face pack in Harvey Nicks. Like their drivers, off-roaders need a makeover, which, fortunately, is just what BMW has done. The Germans may be responsible for some of the worst crimes against style - lederhosen, the Rudi Voller shell suit, and more mullets per head than a Billy Ray Cyrus gig - but with the X5, Made in Munich has become a must-have label. </p> <p>BMW has not made a 4x4 before now, but the men behind the kidney grill know exactly what we want from a big biff-about motor. We want it to be a little bit ghetto fabulous, a little bit refined, and as we waft along looking down on other drivers, we want to feel just as comfortable as if we were in the saloon cars that most of our friends - bless them - still drive. </p> <p>The X5 does not pretend to be a mud-wrestling aristocrat in a head scarf. It is far too pretty for that. Its grill juts manfully at the end of an elegantly toned bonnet, which hides giant wheels. The aluminium running boards are studded with rubber, like a JP Tod's driving loafer, and a cheeky little spoiler says 'Catch me if you can'. The four squat chrome exhaust pipes deliver the reassuringly sporty BMW growl. </p> <p>Inside, the titanium trim, black leather and suede stitching are more loft-living than labrador. Open the boot and there are none of the winches, tow ropes and silly 'I'm-just-off-to-take-the-horsebox-to-Sierra-Leone' accessories. Instead, there are plenty of hi-tech toys - television, satellite navigation, computer - that can be neatly hidden behind black panels in case there is a building boom and architects start making enough money to buy BMWs. The air conditioning is arctic, the roof opens, the back seats and boot are roomy, and there are enough air bags to stop a turbo-charged Rhinoceros. </p> <p>Go for the metallic gold with lowered suspension and black wheels, and you are Puff Daddy. Silver is more Elizabeth Hurley. If stealth wealth is your thing, try midnight blue. Red is the only red-card offence. </p> <p>Style alone should be enough but, this being Britain, there are people out there who actually want to know if it is any good at going along. The answer for those who would not know what a Tod's loafer was if it were served \u00e0 la Milanese is yes, very. BMW may have flogged Land Rover, makers of traditional, agricultural 4x4s, Range Rovers and the popular Freelander, to Ford earlier this year, but they made sure they pinched all the best technology before they turned out the lights and left the keys under the mat. </p> <p>Most 4x4s feel like they might trip themselves up, if you start having too much fun, but the X5 handles remarkably like a saloon. The 4.4-litre version dashes to 60 in eight seconds - a creditable performance for a car of its size - and hits a top speed of more than 140mph.

Off-roaders are big, stodgy, thirsty and drive like barges. You can't park them in town, you can't take off at the lights showing sports cars a clean pair of mud flaps and, worst off all, they are plain bad for your image. Choose a Jeep, and everyone thinks you're overcompensating madly for lack of performance 'off road'. The Mercedes is just too Annette Bening in American Beauty . The Lexus has no class. John Birt did for the Range Rover, and Land Rovers only make sense in the southern hemisphere. Mud-pluggers suffer from the same problem as Country Life . They reek of country piles, Harris Tweed, corduroy keks, wet dogs and wellies, but most people who buy them are 0207. The closest they get to mud is the odd face pack in Harvey Nicks. Like their drivers, off-roaders need a makeover, which, fortunately, is just what BMW has done. The Germans may be responsible for some of the worst crimes against style - lederhosen, the Rudi Voller shell suit, and more mullets per head than a Billy Ray Cyrus gig - but with the X5, Made in Munich has become a must-have label. BMW has not made a 4x4 before now, but the men behind the kidney grill know exactly what we want from a big biff-about motor. We want it to be a little bit ghetto fabulous, a little bit refined, and as we waft along looking down on other drivers, we want to feel just as comfortable as if we were in the saloon cars that most of our friends - bless them - still drive. The X5 does not pretend to be a mud-wrestling aristocrat in a head scarf. It is far too pretty for that. Its grill juts manfully at the end of an elegantly toned bonnet, which hides giant wheels. The aluminium running boards are studded with rubber, like a JP Tod's driving loafer, and a cheeky little spoiler says 'Catch me if you can'. The four squat chrome exhaust pipes deliver the reassuringly sporty BMW growl. Inside, the titanium trim, black leather and suede stitching are more loft-living than labrador. Open the boot and there are none of the winches, tow ropes and silly 'I'm-just-off-to-take-the-horsebox-to-Sierra-Leone' accessories. Instead, there are plenty of hi-tech toys - television, satellite navigation, computer - that can be neatly hidden behind black panels in case there is a building boom and architects start making enough money to buy BMWs. The air conditioning is arctic, the roof opens, the back seats and boot are roomy, and there are enough air bags to stop a turbo-charged Rhinoceros. Go for the metallic gold with lowered suspension and black wheels, and you are Puff Daddy. Silver is more Elizabeth Hurley. If stealth wealth is your thing, try midnight blue. Red is the only red-card offence. Style alone should be enough but, this being Britain, there are people out there who actually want to know if it is any good at going along. The answer for those who would not know what a Tod's loafer was if it were served \u00e0 la Milanese is yes, very. BMW may have flogged Land Rover, makers of traditional, agricultural 4x4s, Range Rovers and the popular Freelander, to Ford earlier this year, but they made sure they pinched all the best technology before they turned out the lights and left the keys under the mat. Most 4x4s feel like they might trip themselves up, if you start having too much fun, but the X5 handles remarkably like a saloon. The 4.4-litre version dashes to 60 in eight seconds - a creditable performance for a car of its size - and hits a top speed of more than 140mph. On country roads, it is stable, cornering with remarkably little body roll, even at high speed. Braking is firm and the steering is effortlessly crisp. On motorways, it is a Club Class ride, although it can feel a little rough on bumpier stretches.

My brother is a good friend of Nancy's husband Marty and heard that she had just set up her own business consultancy. He thought she would be the right person to point me in the right direction. The idea for Barefoot partly came out of my experience of Jungian therapy, which had made me increasingly aware of the importance of myth and legend in storytelling. But I couldn't find satisfactory adaptations of these stories for children. <p>I enjoyed initiating the projects and seeking out writers and artists, but was overwhelmed by the idea of physically producing the books and being responsible for huge sums of money. When I met Nancy, she was intrigued by the idea and wanted to be a part of it. </p> <p>We were both keen to work from home. I was in the throes of a divorce, and as I had three children who were all under the age of six and Nancy had a new baby, childcare was a major issue for both of us. I was desperate to live in the country and found a dilapidated old farmhouse just outside Bath and set up an office on the top floor. </p> <p>It was great when my children were small because I was able to work round them. They are very much part of my working life and I test the books on them. However, now I have more staff and the children are older, we're going to move into offices in Bath. </p> <p>The stress of having to cope with a divorce, moving house and starting a new business was bound to take its toll, and one day, shortly before I was about to drive to Heathrow to fly to Barefoot's first Bologna Book Fair, I lost my vision. Luckily, it was only for about half an hour, but I have no doubt it was stress-related. It was a very frightening moment. </p> <p>Although I'm based near Bath and Nancy's in London, we talk for at least an hour a day and I usually go to London once a week. One of the reasons the relationship works so well is that we don't share an office. We both have strong personalities and we argue a lot but I think it's a case of the friction and the grit making the pearl. </p> <p> <b> Nancy Traversy: </b> When I met Tessa we were both in the middle of enormous changes and I was feeling very vulnerable. I was a new mother and it was the first time in my working life that I wasn't getting a regular salary. Because I'd just had a child, I was drawn to the concept of children's books. I've always been interested in art and design and was excited by the prospect of books that would combine beautiful illustrations with intelligent text. </p> <p>At first I was quite intimidated by Tessa. She's incredibly articulate and she came into my tiny office and spewed out all these words about foreign rights and co-editions. Now I know that Tessa is just very wordy and can make things sound more complicated than they actually are. </p> <p>We've never formally articulated what our separate responsibilities would be. I think it was assumed by both of us that I would look after the business side of things and Tessa would look after the editorial content, but in fact our roles are rather blurred. As the commercial person, I should look after contracts but Tessa does that as she's brilliant at them - it's part of her obsession with words. Similarly, I've often brought new artists on board and I'm responsible for our website. </p> <p>I could never have had four children in five years if I hadn't worked from home. I'd go back to work the day after having had a baby and breastfeed during meetings, but I'm beginning to crave more of a division between my private and professional lives. I'm trying to learn from Tessa how to balance my life better. Once, when we were in New York, I was very ill but insisted on going to meeting after meeting.

However, being the grumpy, destructive bunch we are, thinking positively is a habit we have to teach ourselves, and there is no better way than using what became widely known in the mostly California-centred 'human potential movement' of the 70s as 'doing positive affirmations'.</p> <p>The way affirmation works is similar to the effect of writing 100 lines in school detention: 'I will not talk in class!', for instance. The drawback there is the unconscious mind only registers the positive section of any command and would, in the above example, register 'talk in class!' - line-writing thus only ensuring a steady flow of further detention-room traffic.</p> <p>Doing positive affirmations means you have to phrase the command only in the positive. (I say 'command' because affirmations are nothing more than auto-suggestion - giving your unconscious mind a positive command.) It doesn't matter how you frame the command, as long as the crucial, active part is positive.</p> <p>But there's no point kidding yourself. If you've been suffering from chronic depression, there's no way your mind will react cooperatively with such sentiments as: 'I now feel happy all the time!', no matter how many times you repeat it. This is not about brainwashing yourself. It's about accepting where you are and remembering you have the choice to change it. Your mind would be much more likely to accept, 'Through this depression, I learn to face the dark side of myself. Through facing and accepting the darkness, I grow, and in my growth process I find my peace of mind.' Or more simply put: 'Out of this darkness will come great light!'</p> <p>It is not about denial. If you're struggling with your cashflow - broke, in other words - you won't fool your mind by repeating, 'I am rich, I am rich!' Instead affirm: 'Having no money is teaching me I can survive on very little. Knowing this helps me be more comfortable with the whole material-survival issue. The more comfortable I am with the material plane, the more able I am to operate effectively on it.' This commands your mind to see the positive in your present situation and to open itself to the possibility of an improvement in circumstances.</p> <p>If, however, you veer more towards the magical view of life, you could affirm: 'Money is now coming to me in huge bundles from every direction at once!' (This one generally works, by the way, and I only take 10 per cent commission.)</p> <p>More importantly, though, are affirmations designed to produce change in the way you respond to life by developing your positive qualities. If, having tried the money affirmation for three weeks and 100 grand still hasn't landed in your lap, you may wish to affirm an increase in patience and trust levels. You could repeat: 'I am capable of exercising infinite patience and trust in life's benevolence now' or simply: 'I have infinite patience and trust when I feel like accessing it.'</p> <p>The most effective way to get these affirmations to lodge in your unconscious mind and thus enable you to override the negative is to write each one down at least six times each (it takes six repetitions or more to infiltrate the brain's circuitry). Writing things down is the simplest way to fix the idea. But this is not to say that saying affirmations out loud or even singing them to yourself isn't also highly effective.</p> <p>The best time to 'do' your affirmations is when you'd be otherwise wasting time and energy sitting around worrying or getting gloomy. Instead, use your time and energy to do some positivity training. Other useful times are while sitting in trains, buses, boats and planes, or instead of doodling, sending silly emails or playing computer games while at work - procrastinating, in other words.</p> <p>It generally takes about three weeks of daily affirmation-doing before you begin to see results. But natural serendipity aside, the bigger the thing you're affirming for, the longer it usually takes. Though you could always affirm: 'The bigger the thing I affirm, the more quickly it manifests for me!'</p> <p>You can, in fact, completely and radically alter the entire structure of reality over time, doing affirmations (so be careful what you affirm). Although, according to that old Scottish 'taoist' aphorism, 'What's for ye won't pass ye by and what passes ye by was nay for ye', affirmation-doing will only clarify what you actually want and through clarification accelerate the process somewhat.</p> <p>Let me leave you with a suggested affirmation for the upcoming week: 'Through the rigours of modern life, petrol shortages, unpredictable weather patterns and train timetables, I realise what a magnificent experience life can be and am uplifted!'</p> <p><b>Your letters</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot, For the past year I have been suffering from ovarian pain. I have had scans, but they show nothing out of the ordinary. Have you any suggestions?<br><b>Sandra Robinson, Chelmsford</b></p> <p>Dear Sandra, Tincture of agnus castus can be helpful to reduce unexplained ovarian pain. According to Oriental medicine, it is often caused by a blockage in the body's only horizontal energy meridian - the 'dai mo' or 'belt channel' - which runs round the waist and is responsible for the healthy flow of energy and blood throughout the reproductive organs. A competent acupuncturist can 'unblock' it by inserting needles or pressing points on the forearm and lower legs. It is best to have treatment just after the period for three menstrual cycles or so.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot, Do you think acupuncture can work to reduce facial wrinkles? <br><b> Ted Lawrance, Brighton</b></p> <p>Dear Ted, Facial acupuncture is a speciality of the Vietnamese, who treat the whole body from the face. It was soon discovered that, as a by-product, facial muscle tone, circulation and therefore skin tone would also improve over the course of the treatment. This will smooth out the terrain enough to reduce shadows caused by deep indentations in the skin. Ten sessions over a three-week period can make a noticeable difference. Conversely, this tends to have a beneficial effect on the vital organs as well, so is often worth the experiment.</p> <p>\u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of 'Handbook for the Urban Warrior' and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi. He has been in practice for more than 20 years, specialising in personal-crisis management.

Other useful times are while sitting in trains, buses, boats and planes, or instead of doodling, sending silly emails or playing computer games while at work - procrastinating, in other words. It generally takes about three weeks of daily affirmation-doing before you begin to see results. But natural serendipity aside, the bigger the thing you're affirming for, the longer it usually takes. Though you could always affirm: 'The bigger the thing I affirm, the more quickly it manifests for me!' You can, in fact, completely and radically alter the entire structure of reality over time, doing affirmations (so be careful what you affirm). Although, according to that old Scottish 'taoist' aphorism, 'What's for ye won't pass ye by and what passes ye by was nay for ye', affirmation-doing will only clarify what you actually want and through clarification accelerate the process somewhat. Let me leave you with a suggested affirmation for the upcoming week: 'Through the rigours of modern life, petrol shortages, unpredictable weather patterns and train timetables, I realise what a magnificent experience life can be and am uplifted!' Your letters Dear Barefoot, For the past year I have been suffering from ovarian pain. I have had scans, but they show nothing out of the ordinary. Have you any suggestions? Sandra Robinson, Chelmsford Dear Sandra, Tincture of agnus castus can be helpful to reduce unexplained ovarian pain. According to Oriental medicine, it is often caused by a blockage in the body's only horizontal energy meridian - the 'dai mo' or 'belt channel' - which runs round the waist and is responsible for the healthy flow of energy and blood throughout the reproductive organs. A competent acupuncturist can 'unblock' it by inserting needles or pressing points on the forearm and lower legs. It is best to have treatment just after the period for three menstrual cycles or so. Dear Barefoot, Do you think acupuncture can work to reduce facial wrinkles? Ted Lawrance, Brighton Dear Ted, Facial acupuncture is a speciality of the Vietnamese, who treat the whole body from the face. It was soon discovered that, as a by-product, facial muscle tone, circulation and therefore skin tone would also improve over the course of the treatment. This will smooth out the terrain enough to reduce shadows caused by deep indentations in the skin. Ten sessions over a three-week period can make a noticeable difference. Conversely, this tends to have a beneficial effect on the vital organs as well, so is often worth the experiment. \u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of 'Handbook for the Urban Warrior' and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi. He has been in practice for more than 20 years, specialising in personal-crisis management.

Most game is hung for about three to seven days depending on the weather (in the old days when stronger flavours were preferred it would have been anything from 10 to 14 days), and most is hand dressed rather than machine plucked - although the feathery down on mallard makes it time consuming to deal with, they still cost a reasonable \u00a34.98 a bird.</p> <p>Among the more unusual items of game is squirrel (grey, of course), which Peter Dale and Paul Cook supply at The Game Larder , 24 The Parade, Claygate, Surrey (01372 462 879) and at PJ Dale, 27 Bridge Road, East Molesey (020 8979 3800).

This important principle is adhered to when it comes to hares (\u00a311 each), which Club Chef Direct sources solely from areas with large populations such as Oxfordshire and Yorkshire. Both red and fallow deer are generally reared in parks and culled, so they have a semi-wild existence, but roe deer are completely wild and many people consider their leaner meat and finer flavour worth paying a bit extra for.

      "body": "<p>Although few of us are old enough to remember it, we all have vivid images of the First World War, evoked by grainy black-and-white pictures of mud-filled trenches, army hospitals and maimed soldiers. Each year we buy our poppies in honour of the 8.5m people killed in the conflict. Yet there is no commemorative service or Whitehall memorial to remind us of the estimated 40m victims killed worldwide in 1918 by an even more deadly enemy: flu. Although largely forgotten, the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 killed not only more people than the First World War, but probably more in a shorter period than any outbreak of infectious disease ever known to humanity, including bubonic plague. It preyed on mainly young, healthy adults and struck just about every country in the world.</p> <p>The flu threat is very much alive today. Indeed, virologists predict that the next flu pandemic - which could again slay millions throughout the world - may be just around the corner. 'We are like vulcanologists,' says John Oxford, professor of virology at St Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital. 'We are sitting on our volcano, and we don't know when it is going to erupt.'</p> <p>But since pandemics have a habit of appearing at intervals of 11 to 42 years - there were three last century, in 1918, 1957 and 1968 - he believes we can expect the next one 'sooner rather than later'. When it comes it will cause more than a few coughs and sniffles.</p> <p>Most of us think of flu as a nuisance - inconvenient but not life threatening. We ache all over, take to our beds and feel generally sorry for ourselves. But even last winter, when flu did not officially reach epidemic levels, the health service was overwhelmed, and an estimated 16,000 people, mostly elderly, died from flu-related illnesses in England and Wales. A pandemic - when an epidemic goes global - would have devastating effect.</p> <p>Although we are far better prepared than in 1918 - and Britain is one of the few countries with a pandemic plan - it will still cause mass chaos and huge numbers of deaths, predicts Professor Oxford. 'We have to be realistic about it,' he says. 'I think there will be a big problem.'</p> <p>Dr Alan Hay, director of the World Health Organisation's influenza centre at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London, agrees. 'It is an ever-present threat. You have no idea when the next pandemic will occur. You have no idea of the nature of the virus.'</p> <p>Both believe the key to preventing potential catastrophe may lie in understanding what happened in 1918. The quest has led scientists to the frozen wastes of Alaska and Spitsbergen in efforts to isolate the 1918 flu virus from victims buried in the permafrost. The aim is to unravel the bug's unique chemistry - in the hope of detecting what made it so lethal - before another, perhaps equally virulent, virus emerges.</p> <p>'We want to know as much as possible about that virus because we really don't know why it caused such serious illness in healthy young adults,' says Dr Hay. 'It is not only important scientifically, but that is the feature that makes a repeat so scary.'</p> <p>An international race against time is on. An American team is trying to sequence the genetic structure of the virus using samples from an Inuit victim unearthed in Alaska. British scientists at the NIMR are attempting the same task using tissue from six Norwegian coalminers exhumed by an international band of flu experts in Spitsbergen in 1998. So far, results have been disappointing.</p> <p>But Professor Oxford, who was a member of the Spitsbergen expedition, now hopes he can unlock the secret of the 1918 pandemic closer to home. He wants to exhume 11 victims buried in lead coffins tracked down to cemeteries in south-west London. If well enough preserved by their lead encasements, these bodies may provide the specimens which yield the vital clue to the 1918 - and perhaps the next - pandemic.</p> <p>Pandemic flu has so far confounded scientists. They know the flu virus mutates all the time. The strains around last winter will have subtly changed when this year's flu season takes off over the next few months, although anyone who caught flu in recent years should retain some immunity. A pandemic emerges when the virus changes its genetic code so significantly it is effectively a new virus, meaning nobody is immune.</p> <p>There have been 31 such pandemics since the earliest records in 1580. In 1918, one-quarter of Britons were struck down, and an estimated 250,000 died. Death came rapidly, within 36 hours, and horrifically, from bronchitis, pneumonia or simply the virus overwhelming the lungs. In 1957, flu caused an estimated 30,000 excess deaths. At its peak, GPs saw up to 100 cases a day, and one Liverpool hospital had one-third of nurses off sick. In 1968-9, there were 78,000 deaths in two waves.</p> <p>Dr Douglas Fleming was a young GP in 1968. 'I remember my partners and I made 40 visits on Boxing Day,' he says. But in those days, the NHS had much greater flexibility to admit victims, says Dr Fleming, now director of the flu surveillance unit of the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p> <p>Yet it is still not clear why a new virus emerges or where it comes from. Theories range from dust deposited by comets to the virus lying dormant in elderly people. The commonest belief is that flu in birds jumps species into pigs, which act as a mixing pot for the virus to jump again into humans. Most pandemics originate in Asia, where people, pigs and poultry live in close proximity.</p> <p>But three years ago, global panic ensued when flu in chickens jumped directly to humans, infecting 18 people and killing six in Hong Kong. The virus failed to take the next critical step, passing from humans to humans, but public-health officials took no chances.

      "bodyText": "Although few of us are old enough to remember it, we all have vivid images of the First World War, evoked by grainy black-and-white pictures of mud-filled trenches, army hospitals and maimed soldiers. Each year we buy our poppies in honour of the 8.5m people killed in the conflict. Yet there is no commemorative service or Whitehall memorial to remind us of the estimated 40m victims killed worldwide in 1918 by an even more deadly enemy: flu. Although largely forgotten, the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 killed not only more people than the First World War, but probably more in a shorter period than any outbreak of infectious disease ever known to humanity, including bubonic plague. It preyed on mainly young, healthy adults and struck just about every country in the world. The flu threat is very much alive today. Indeed, virologists predict that the next flu pandemic - which could again slay millions throughout the world - may be just around the corner. 'We are like vulcanologists,' says John Oxford, professor of virology at St Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital. 'We are sitting on our volcano, and we don't know when it is going to erupt.' But since pandemics have a habit of appearing at intervals of 11 to 42 years - there were three last century, in 1918, 1957 and 1968 - he believes we can expect the next one 'sooner rather than later'. When it comes it will cause more than a few coughs and sniffles. Most of us think of flu as a nuisance - inconvenient but not life threatening. We ache all over, take to our beds and feel generally sorry for ourselves. But even last winter, when flu did not officially reach epidemic levels, the health service was overwhelmed, and an estimated 16,000 people, mostly elderly, died from flu-related illnesses in England and Wales. A pandemic - when an epidemic goes global - would have devastating effect. Although we are far better prepared than in 1918 - and Britain is one of the few countries with a pandemic plan - it will still cause mass chaos and huge numbers of deaths, predicts Professor Oxford. 'We have to be realistic about it,' he says. 'I think there will be a big problem.' Dr Alan Hay, director of the World Health Organisation's influenza centre at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London, agrees. 'It is an ever-present threat. You have no idea when the next pandemic will occur. You have no idea of the nature of the virus.' Both believe the key to preventing potential catastrophe may lie in understanding what happened in 1918. The quest has led scientists to the frozen wastes of Alaska and Spitsbergen in efforts to isolate the 1918 flu virus from victims buried in the permafrost. The aim is to unravel the bug's unique chemistry - in the hope of detecting what made it so lethal - before another, perhaps equally virulent, virus emerges. 'We want to know as much as possible about that virus because we really don't know why it caused such serious illness in healthy young adults,' says Dr Hay. 'It is not only important scientifically, but that is the feature that makes a repeat so scary.' An international race against time is on. An American team is trying to sequence the genetic structure of the virus using samples from an Inuit victim unearthed in Alaska. British scientists at the NIMR are attempting the same task using tissue from six Norwegian coalminers exhumed by an international band of flu experts in Spitsbergen in 1998. So far, results have been disappointing. But Professor Oxford, who was a member of the Spitsbergen expedition, now hopes he can unlock the secret of the 1918 pandemic closer to home. He wants to exhume 11 victims buried in lead coffins tracked down to cemeteries in south-west London. If well enough preserved by their lead encasements, these bodies may provide the specimens which yield the vital clue to the 1918 - and perhaps the next - pandemic. Pandemic flu has so far confounded scientists. They know the flu virus mutates all the time. The strains around last winter will have subtly changed when this year's flu season takes off over the next few months, although anyone who caught flu in recent years should retain some immunity. A pandemic emerges when the virus changes its genetic code so significantly it is effectively a new virus, meaning nobody is immune. There have been 31 such pandemics since the earliest records in 1580. In 1918, one-quarter of Britons were struck down, and an estimated 250,000 died. Death came rapidly, within 36 hours, and horrifically, from bronchitis, pneumonia or simply the virus overwhelming the lungs. In 1957, flu caused an estimated 30,000 excess deaths. At its peak, GPs saw up to 100 cases a day, and one Liverpool hospital had one-third of nurses off sick. In 1968-9, there were 78,000 deaths in two waves. Dr Douglas Fleming was a young GP in 1968. 'I remember my partners and I made 40 visits on Boxing Day,' he says. But in those days, the NHS had much greater flexibility to admit victims, says Dr Fleming, now director of the flu surveillance unit of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Yet it is still not clear why a new virus emerges or where it comes from. Theories range from dust deposited by comets to the virus lying dormant in elderly people. The commonest belief is that flu in birds jumps species into pigs, which act as a mixing pot for the virus to jump again into humans. Most pandemics originate in Asia, where people, pigs and poultry live in close proximity. But three years ago, global panic ensued when flu in chickens jumped directly to humans, infecting 18 people and killing six in Hong Kong. The virus failed to take the next critical step, passing from humans to humans, but public-health officials took no chances. They slaughtered every chicken in the province. The 1918 flu was different. There is no evidence it came from China or birds, although it did affect pigs. Dubbed the Spanish flu, because early cases were identified there, it did not, however, begin in Spain. Professor Oxford now believes it first arose among British troops stationed in Etaples, France in 1916. He identified the camp, which 1 million soldiers passed through, from a censored edition of The Lancet reporting a large flu-like outbreak that year. If true, this means the virus seeded itself for two years before erupting - probably helped by demobilisation - simultaneously throughout the world in 1918. It is vital evidence, says Professor Oxford, that we may have a similar breathing space to develop a vaccine when another virus appears. This may still not avert disaster. There is now continuous global surveillance - Britain's NIMR is one of four international monitoring centres - devoted to spotting a new virus quickly. But developing a vaccine could take six months and produce only limited supplies. 'In theory, a new virus could appear in Hong Kong today, get on a plane and be in Europe the next day,' says Dr John Watson, head of the Public Health Laboratory Service's respiratory division. Large outbreaks will probably take longer. 'But,' he says, 'it is very likely that at least the first wave of a pandemic, however severe, would be hitting populations before a vaccine was available.'

      "byline": "Kate Mikhail",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Everywhere you look there are pictures of Patti topless. Here she's dressed in red PVC, over there she's decked out in black leather and thigh-length boots. Thousands of photographs and paintings surround you, and in all of them she's wearing red lippy and a beaming smile. </p> <p>Patti Prime is moving. The house she once shared with the late artist John Bratby, as his wife and muse, has been sold, and the temple he created to her is being taken apart. Black carrier bags are lined up by the front door while indoors a gentle chaos reigns. The cats have scarpered, presumably in protest. </p> <p>John Bratby was once a household name. He was the enfant terrible of the 50s who rocketed to fame at 26 with his expressionist- realist works of loos, dustbins and kitchen clutter. And Patti, whom he met through a lonely-hearts ad in Time Out after his marriage to his first wife (fellow art student Jean Cooke) fell apart, became his inspiration, obsession and number-one model. 'He did adore me,' says Patti, matter-of-factly. 'He put me on a pedestal, and I took it as my due.' </p> <p>It's eight years since Bratby died, collapsing on his way home from the local chippy, but the Cupola and Tower of the Winds, the 20-room house the two of them shared for 14 years high on a hill in Hastings is largely unchanged. Patti, now 70, opens the door. Small, with short, dark curly hair and inquisitive, piercing eyes, she is framed by a jumble of photographs on the wall behind, which sweeps out from the entrance to every nook and cranny in the house. Scenes of Venice, Paris and Moscow jostle for space alongside movie stars, faded correspondence between Bratby and the rich and famous, portraits of the artist and, of course, Patti. The layers and layers of old photographs are gummed one on top of the other like old, peeling wallpaper. </p> <p>It is a big, shabby, ramshackle house made intimate by the hotchpotch of colourful snaps crowding in from all sides. Canvases, several deep, are propped up against the walls. Most are small portraits from Bratby's 'Gallery of Individuals', for which he invited well-known figures of the day to sit. Paul McCartney, Tom Stoppard and Bob Hoskins were just three of the 1,500 who accepted the invitation to join Bratby's 'elitist series', which he said was 'a protest against the notion of an egalitarian society'. </p> <p>The rest are mainly of Patti in front of various tourist landmarks. Vulgar, brash, fun and cheery, up to four Patties - invariably topless - appear at once on a canvas, often with the bespectacled artist in tow. Bratby, one of the most prolific painters of all time, who could knock out a portrait in a couple of hours - though often at the expense of quality - described her as posing 'like a 40s and 50s pin-up girl, with a laughing or smiling face and poses reminiscent of the style of Betty Grable'. </p> <p>The paint has literally been squeezed from the tubes on to the canvas - hence the term tubism which was stamped on Bratby's later work. The colours are pure and unadulterated, giving his paintings a canvas-shaking vibrancy. Throw open Patti's wardrobe and the colours are all here, too: red, yellow, purple, green. Bratby loved dressing up his 24/7 model, and picked the colours he wanted to paint. He spent thousands of pounds on clothes for Patti, which he listed as a hobby in Who's Who, and was constantly asking her to dress up and pose ('It was not worth saying no, as he would go into a sulk'). The wardrobe he put together is flash, brassy and very 80s, packed with full-length red and black PVC and leather coats, sequins, studs, lace and fur, gold, silver and purple jackets, matching flouncy skirts and big, padded shoulders. When he found something he liked, he bought it in several colours. Patti didn't get a look in - she wasn't allowed to choose anything, but instead gave herself over to the role of artist's model. 'I had to like them, didn't I?' </p> <p>Not surprisingly, she 'got tired of dressing up', and now dresses to please herself. The PVC has gone. And everything black has been consigned to the bin. 'I have never dressed up since [Bratby's death],' she says. 'I don't wear high heels, just jeans and a T-shirt.' Today is clearly an exception - though Patti style - as she's wearing a dragon- covered Issey Miyake outfit ('I have lots of them'), creating a cheerful splash of colour as she shimmers around the dusty, semi- dismantled house. Warm, friendly and chatty, she peppers her sentences with 'sweetie', 'angel', 'precious', 'my dearest love'. And every now and again you catch a glimpse of the Japanese peony tattoo called John on her shin, which used to have a partner in a tigress called Patti that Bratby wore on his arm. </p> <p>'I'm a failed actress,' says Patti, who was a drama teacher when she met John in 1973. 'If you can't do, teach.' She is very self-deprecating, and you can't help thinking that she must have been swamped by Bratby's creative energy. 'I'm not good at anything,' she states, which is patently not true, given all the sensitive, up-close photographic portraits she's taken of the wild-haired Bratby, who came more and more to look like Raymond Briggs' ratbag of a Father Christmas. </p> <p>In the 50s and 60s, Bratby, a Royal Academician, was constantly in the press, and the myth that grew up around him painted a wild, flamboyant, though at times contradictory image. He has been described as an extrovert, introspective, shy, sensitive, intelligent, quarrelsome, aggressive, a recluse, egotistical, belligerent and an alcoholic. He himself wrote: 'I do not love people. In fact, I may lean to misanthropy, though people fascinate me.' His public image was further confused when he produced the large-scale works needed for The Horse's Mouth in 1957, which starred Alec Guinness as a difficult, bohemian artist, a character which became associated with Bratby. </p> <p>Patti sums him up as a 'shopaholic and workaholic'. 'He was volatile, vivacious, moody and grumpy,' she says. 'He thought no one liked him, but they did.' He was also a very practical person and 'a good provider'. 'If we were broke or in a muddle, he would always knock out something or get us out of it.' But with Bratby gone, 'suddenly he was not there to paint another picture', forcing Patti to look for a more modest house nearby, which will allow her to 'carry on travelling while I'm still standing'. </p> <p>Bratby's career peaked in the 50s, when he was seen as a leading light in the Kitchen Sink gang, a group of artists who painted the ordinary and everyday. His pots and jars and cornflake packets established him as the granddaddy of Pop Art. Then, in 1960, he was, as he put it, 'dropped like a cold potato'. Abstract art followed by Pop Art swept in and shunted the Kitchen Sinkers to one side. At the same time, the critics turned against him. But Bratby was a great self-promoter, which many in the establishment saw as vulgar; he wrote novels and continued to paint away at a furious speed, exhibiting all over the country and selling to an ever-loyal public right up until he started to come back into fashion the year before his death. His great ridges of slapped-on paint tell of his indebtedness to Van Gogh, though he was also heavily influenced by the domesticity of Sickert's work and, initially, his subdued tones. </p> <p>The couple married in 1977. Bratby's marriage to Jean had been dissolved and his affair with one of his models had come to an abrupt end. 'He tried to kill her in his Mercedes, by driving into a wall on purpose,' according to Patti, 'and that was the end of their relationship.' </p> <p>The newlyweds lived a life of extreme contrasts. Most of the time they muddled along in Hastings, with the odd 'blazing row', while Bratby churned out works at a feverish pace. Then they would travel - to London, Paris or Venice - and they always travelled in style. Bratby saw a white, chauffeur-driven Roller as a must, and cabs as vulgar. They stayed in the best rooms in the best hotels, and shopped for Patti's clothes on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. And if the cash got low, Bratby, the obsessively prolific artist, would simply sell another picture. Twenty-two years after they first moved in, the same Regency wallpaper remains. The stairs and windows are bare; the Bratbys never bought carpets or curtains. 'Any money we had we spent on ourselves, not on the house,' says Patti. </p> <p>There's no doubt that Bratby had an obsessive personality: he was a driven man who focused his energies on art, money and Patti. He fired off bundles of letters on a weekly basis (generally written or typed by Patti, apparently, because his DT's were often too bad for him to write himself), wrote a minutely detailed diary, and kept numerous scrapbooks of his press cuttings - with all references to him helpfully marked in ink. He was also a fiercely jealous man, as far as Patti was concerned. If she met a friend in the street she'd whisper, 'Don't kiss me, John's looking.' He was even jealous of her pets. 'I had a lot of pets at one time, but had to get rid of them, as they took up too much of my time, and he was a very, very jealous person.' Patti used to have 12 doves which flew around the house's picturesque green and white cupola, until John looked up one day and saw the damage they were doing to the gutter. 'He collected the doves and drowned them in the water barrel,' says Patti, without emotion. 'He filled it with seeds and then filled it with water.

'If a window was broken, it would stay broken. If a tap came off in your hand, it stayed off.' They never had central heating, and Patti would go to bed during the winter months wearing a coat. His antisocial ways saw the couple up and out by 6am for their daily walk through empty streets. 'John would bring back a dead fox or a sheep's skeleton, which smelled terribly, and paint them.'

They indulged in the high life, and Bratby looked after her well. He described her as 'a jazzy sort of person', and happily gave her credit for inspiring him in his work. 'All my paintings since I married Patti have been affected by her personality,' he said. He also liked her by his side at all times. 'I was always with him,' says Patti. 'He was bolted to my side. He couldn't go to the loo without me.' </p> <p>She says it took her six years of mourning to finally get over his death. Bulging dustbin bags and cardboard boxes show the ruthless sorting out that is going on.

'On my sad demise, my cousin will have a luxury holiday with her husband and take us out to a lagoon and spread us on it.' Patti admits she's 'desperate to be leaving her beautiful, happy house', but she's also determined to be positive about the future. And when a camera is pointed in her direction, she automatically goes into pose mode, beams at the camera and says, 'Give us a smile girl, give us a smile.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Everywhere you look there are pictures of Patti topless. Here she's dressed in red PVC, over there she's decked out in black leather and thigh-length boots. Thousands of photographs and paintings surround you, and in all of them she's wearing red lippy and a beaming smile. Patti Prime is moving. The house she once shared with the late artist John Bratby, as his wife and muse, has been sold, and the temple he created to her is being taken apart. Black carrier bags are lined up by the front door while indoors a gentle chaos reigns. The cats have scarpered, presumably in protest. John Bratby was once a household name. He was the enfant terrible of the 50s who rocketed to fame at 26 with his expressionist- realist works of loos, dustbins and kitchen clutter. And Patti, whom he met through a lonely-hearts ad in Time Out after his marriage to his first wife (fellow art student Jean Cooke) fell apart, became his inspiration, obsession and number-one model. 'He did adore me,' says Patti, matter-of-factly. 'He put me on a pedestal, and I took it as my due.' It's eight years since Bratby died, collapsing on his way home from the local chippy, but the Cupola and Tower of the Winds, the 20-room house the two of them shared for 14 years high on a hill in Hastings is largely unchanged. Patti, now 70, opens the door. Small, with short, dark curly hair and inquisitive, piercing eyes, she is framed by a jumble of photographs on the wall behind, which sweeps out from the entrance to every nook and cranny in the house. Scenes of Venice, Paris and Moscow jostle for space alongside movie stars, faded correspondence between Bratby and the rich and famous, portraits of the artist and, of course, Patti. The layers and layers of old photographs are gummed one on top of the other like old, peeling wallpaper. It is a big, shabby, ramshackle house made intimate by the hotchpotch of colourful snaps crowding in from all sides. Canvases, several deep, are propped up against the walls. Most are small portraits from Bratby's 'Gallery of Individuals', for which he invited well-known figures of the day to sit. Paul McCartney, Tom Stoppard and Bob Hoskins were just three of the 1,500 who accepted the invitation to join Bratby's 'elitist series', which he said was 'a protest against the notion of an egalitarian society'. The rest are mainly of Patti in front of various tourist landmarks. Vulgar, brash, fun and cheery, up to four Patties - invariably topless - appear at once on a canvas, often with the bespectacled artist in tow. Bratby, one of the most prolific painters of all time, who could knock out a portrait in a couple of hours - though often at the expense of quality - described her as posing 'like a 40s and 50s pin-up girl, with a laughing or smiling face and poses reminiscent of the style of Betty Grable'. The paint has literally been squeezed from the tubes on to the canvas - hence the term tubism which was stamped on Bratby's later work. The colours are pure and unadulterated, giving his paintings a canvas-shaking vibrancy. Throw open Patti's wardrobe and the colours are all here, too: red, yellow, purple, green. Bratby loved dressing up his 24/7 model, and picked the colours he wanted to paint. He spent thousands of pounds on clothes for Patti, which he listed as a hobby in Who's Who, and was constantly asking her to dress up and pose ('It was not worth saying no, as he would go into a sulk'). The wardrobe he put together is flash, brassy and very 80s, packed with full-length red and black PVC and leather coats, sequins, studs, lace and fur, gold, silver and purple jackets, matching flouncy skirts and big, padded shoulders. When he found something he liked, he bought it in several colours. Patti didn't get a look in - she wasn't allowed to choose anything, but instead gave herself over to the role of artist's model. 'I had to like them, didn't I?' Not surprisingly, she 'got tired of dressing up', and now dresses to please herself. The PVC has gone. And everything black has been consigned to the bin. 'I have never dressed up since [Bratby's death],' she says. 'I don't wear high heels, just jeans and a T-shirt.' Today is clearly an exception - though Patti style - as she's wearing a dragon- covered Issey Miyake outfit ('I have lots of them'), creating a cheerful splash of colour as she shimmers around the dusty, semi- dismantled house. Warm, friendly and chatty, she peppers her sentences with 'sweetie', 'angel', 'precious', 'my dearest love'. And every now and again you catch a glimpse of the Japanese peony tattoo called John on her shin, which used to have a partner in a tigress called Patti that Bratby wore on his arm. 'I'm a failed actress,' says Patti, who was a drama teacher when she met John in 1973. 'If you can't do, teach.' She is very self-deprecating, and you can't help thinking that she must have been swamped by Bratby's creative energy. 'I'm not good at anything,' she states, which is patently not true, given all the sensitive, up-close photographic portraits she's taken of the wild-haired Bratby, who came more and more to look like Raymond Briggs' ratbag of a Father Christmas. In the 50s and 60s, Bratby, a Royal Academician, was constantly in the press, and the myth that grew up around him painted a wild, flamboyant, though at times contradictory image. He has been described as an extrovert, introspective, shy, sensitive, intelligent, quarrelsome, aggressive, a recluse, egotistical, belligerent and an alcoholic. He himself wrote: 'I do not love people. In fact, I may lean to misanthropy, though people fascinate me.' His public image was further confused when he produced the large-scale works needed for The Horse's Mouth in 1957, which starred Alec Guinness as a difficult, bohemian artist, a character which became associated with Bratby. Patti sums him up as a 'shopaholic and workaholic'. 'He was volatile, vivacious, moody and grumpy,' she says. 'He thought no one liked him, but they did.' He was also a very practical person and 'a good provider'. 'If we were broke or in a muddle, he would always knock out something or get us out of it.' But with Bratby gone, 'suddenly he was not there to paint another picture', forcing Patti to look for a more modest house nearby, which will allow her to 'carry on travelling while I'm still standing'. Bratby's career peaked in the 50s, when he was seen as a leading light in the Kitchen Sink gang, a group of artists who painted the ordinary and everyday. His pots and jars and cornflake packets established him as the granddaddy of Pop Art. Then, in 1960, he was, as he put it, 'dropped like a cold potato'. Abstract art followed by Pop Art swept in and shunted the Kitchen Sinkers to one side. At the same time, the critics turned against him. But Bratby was a great self-promoter, which many in the establishment saw as vulgar; he wrote novels and continued to paint away at a furious speed, exhibiting all over the country and selling to an ever-loyal public right up until he started to come back into fashion the year before his death. His great ridges of slapped-on paint tell of his indebtedness to Van Gogh, though he was also heavily influenced by the domesticity of Sickert's work and, initially, his subdued tones. The couple married in 1977. Bratby's marriage to Jean had been dissolved and his affair with one of his models had come to an abrupt end. 'He tried to kill her in his Mercedes, by driving into a wall on purpose,' according to Patti, 'and that was the end of their relationship.' The newlyweds lived a life of extreme contrasts. Most of the time they muddled along in Hastings, with the odd 'blazing row', while Bratby churned out works at a feverish pace. Then they would travel - to London, Paris or Venice - and they always travelled in style. Bratby saw a white, chauffeur-driven Roller as a must, and cabs as vulgar. They stayed in the best rooms in the best hotels, and shopped for Patti's clothes on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. And if the cash got low, Bratby, the obsessively prolific artist, would simply sell another picture. Twenty-two years after they first moved in, the same Regency wallpaper remains. The stairs and windows are bare; the Bratbys never bought carpets or curtains. 'Any money we had we spent on ourselves, not on the house,' says Patti. There's no doubt that Bratby had an obsessive personality: he was a driven man who focused his energies on art, money and Patti. He fired off bundles of letters on a weekly basis (generally written or typed by Patti, apparently, because his DT's were often too bad for him to write himself), wrote a minutely detailed diary, and kept numerous scrapbooks of his press cuttings - with all references to him helpfully marked in ink. He was also a fiercely jealous man, as far as Patti was concerned. If she met a friend in the street she'd whisper, 'Don't kiss me, John's looking.' He was even jealous of her pets. 'I had a lot of pets at one time, but had to get rid of them, as they took up too much of my time, and he was a very, very jealous person.' Patti used to have 12 doves which flew around the house's picturesque green and white cupola, until John looked up one day and saw the damage they were doing to the gutter. 'He collected the doves and drowned them in the water barrel,' says Patti, without emotion. 'He filled it with seeds and then filled it with water. I never told him I knew, but I knew, and I have never forgiven him for doing that.' Bratby was by all accounts a big drinker and a recluse, happy to be on his own with Patti. Nobody was ever invited for dinner,' she recalls, 'he would not have anybody in the house', apart from those invited to sit for him for a few hours. This policy even extended to builders. 'If a window was broken, it would stay broken. If a tap came off in your hand, it stayed off.' They never had central heating, and Patti would go to bed during the winter months wearing a coat. His antisocial ways saw the couple up and out by 6am for their daily walk through empty streets. 'John would bring back a dead fox or a sheep's skeleton, which smelled terribly, and paint them.' Food was delivered to the door, and when Bratby wanted cider or beer he'd send a cab or Patti to pick it up. But the Bratbys had 'a wonderful life', according to Patti, even though she says it is 'very, very hard to live on a pedestal'. They indulged in the high life, and Bratby looked after her well. He described her as 'a jazzy sort of person', and happily gave her credit for inspiring him in his work. 'All my paintings since I married Patti have been affected by her personality,' he said. He also liked her by his side at all times. 'I was always with him,' says Patti. 'He was bolted to my side. He couldn't go to the loo without me.' She says it took her six years of mourning to finally get over his death. Bulging dustbin bags and cardboard boxes show the ruthless sorting out that is going on. An urn filled with Bratby's ashes sits above the marble and Wedgwood fireplace in the main living room and one-time studio, ready to be packed up - this is something Patti intends take with her wherever she goes. 'On my sad demise, my cousin will have a luxury holiday with her husband and take us out to a lagoon and spread us on it.' Patti admits she's 'desperate to be leaving her beautiful, happy house', but she's also determined to be positive about the future. And when a camera is pointed in her direction, she automatically goes into pose mode, beams at the camera and says, 'Give us a smile girl, give us a smile.'",

The search is almost as thrilling as the discovery, because you're constantly about to find it. Every expedition has setbacks to stop you being blas\u00e9. The following disasters have happened to me, but the perfect adventure would avoid as many of them as possible: The locals would not complain that the helicopters we had brought in had frightened their goats. They tried to claim that some of the animals had died, and demanded that we pay them the equivalent of \u00a380 per goat. The area we chose to explore would not turn out to be highly important to the local people because there are graves there they don't want disturbed, causing them to go to the Minister of Culture to demand that the digging be stopped. This usually prompts a moratorium on the work until complainants are paid off. The perfect team of archaeologists would not be unbelievably slow, like most archaeologists have to be. They'd put up with me using a pickaxe and shovel, rather than their usual toothbrushes, to speed up their work. The exploration would not be staffed by volunteers from an air-force compound who were extremely pleased to see that the team comprised 18-year-old blonde archaeologists who I tried, unsuccessfully, to chaperone. All of this would be conducted not in a blazing heat but with a perfect tropical breeze, and no nasty creepy-crawlies. Ideally, you'd have a tuneful melody maker with a guitar. Setbacks aside, the thrill of the search is the hunt. Humans have been hunting since the beginning of time, and explorations have the same excitement. \u0095 Ranulph Fiennes's Beyond the Limits (\u00a320, Little, Brown) is out now",

      "body": "<p>Age is the new youth and retirement promises to be a second dose of adolescence. According to a report out this week, Fit and Fifty, not only are today's fiftysomethings breathing unaided, they may well be turning into 'Kevins', casting off jumpers and slippers in favour of clubbing or climbing gear, and - the safest sex of all - learning to love themselves through self-development and 'personal creativity'.</p> <p>Professor Richard Scase of Kent University, one of the co-authors of the study produced for the Government's Economic and Social Research Council, says fiftysomethings are 'adopting more self-focused hedonistic attitudes as they imitate younger ways of living - they expect to retire in their fifties and have another 30 years ahead of them.'</p> <p>The report follows an announcement that BBC2 is to reposition itself and target a 35- to 55-year-old audience with a more 'mature' (presumably as in 'young mature') format. Over on BBC1, half the nation has been watching silver-haired folk fornicating on EastEnders, and suddenly, old - as in 50-plus - is no longer deemed ugly, toothless, sexless, incontinent, senile, confused and helpless.</p> <p>Yet the way in which the media, the advertising industry and academics are now cackhandedly trying to redefine this age group paradoxically underlines how strong is our continuing obsession with youth.</p> <p>The baby boomers have, of course, struck again. Anthropologist Helen Fisher says: 'They travel through society like a guinea pig moving through a python, changing culture as they grow older.' Note, changing culture - not hankering to turn the clock back to their youth. The baby boomers created the teenager, furnished suburbia with Habitat and have now reached the 'November of the body'. The 50-plus group makes up one in three of the population. By 2040 they will account for half.</p> <p>A proportion of older people will continue to face poverty - particularly women forced to rely on inadequate state and private pensions and those crippled by life-long low pay - but many more will have the cash to amuse themselves to death, if they so choose.</p> <p>Neil Jenner heads the London branch of the marketing firm Senioragency which focuses on the 50-plus group. In Britain, he says, this group has an annual income of \u00a3166bn, and this will rise to \u00a3260bn in 20 years.</p> <p>On average, the 50-plus market has a 30 per cent higher disposable income than the under-50s - yet 90 per cent of all advertising is directed at the young.</p> <p>'Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!' wrote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Grey - and that's precisely how it appears in millennium Britain. Youth rules, so ageism is rife. A study published in April discovered that the Government's voluntary code of practice on age diversity is ignored by two out of three employers. The over-35s are paid less, trained less and regarded already as 'off-peak'. Experience counts for little.</p> <p>In Beyond Power, Women, Men and Morals, Marilyn French writes: 'The best intentioned efforts to solve human problems falter or fail because they are dyed in the same patterns of thinking that created the problem.' So the 'problem' of age today is viewed as the absence of youth, and the answer is to bring about its restoration. Hence, marketing to the newly retired as if they were born-again twentysomethings - what Jenner, despairing of the advertising industry's lack of imagination, calls 'the grey surfers'.</p> <p>The obsession with youth underestimates another important difference in the baby boomer generation: people may accrue the same number of years yet be in very different places in their respective life cycles. The parents of today's fiftysomethings courted in their teens, and married in their early twenties, then in their forties saw their own children wed. Then they retired in their sixties. Now, divorce, separation, delayed parenthood, women in the workplace and job insecurity means the traditional cards in the game of Happy Families have been drastically reshuffled.</p> <p>Life has a far less conventional pattern. Men may marry for the first time in their thirties; women may have their first child in their forties. Others may retire 15 years earlier than their parents did.</p> <p>Yet in the arts, media and marketplace the portrayal of fiftysomethings often bears no hint of this change. The 'new' old are either relegated to the walk-in bath and chair-lift zone of life or treated to 'role models' such as Joan Collins and Cliff Richard, time bandits frozen at 40.</p> <p>Perhaps revenge is at hand. Soon the 50-plus age group will make up the majority of consumers - and what will the admen do then? Kath Harris, associate director of RDSi, which undertakes 'grey market studies', this month published a report on the common characteristics of the nouveau grise whom, she concedes, do not profess a desire to be forever young.</p> <p>Harris calls the baby boomer grey generation 'a child in time', sandwiched between the austerity of their parents' generation and the consumerism of their children. They dislike the actual process of aging but lack 'ambition or aspiration to acquire consumer goods. Identity is rarely played out through the conspicuous adoption of brands as symbols of what they aspire to be.'</p> <p>In short, they may have the dosh but they have no desire to spend it to keep up with the junior Joneses, or to point up who they are.</p> <p>Perhaps we're about to discover that with longevity may also come a revival of that old hippy resistance to materialism, acquisitiveness and competitiveness?</p> <p>Forecasters such as the Henley Centre tell us that we already live in 'the experience culture' in which knowledge, exploration and exercise matter more than the acquisition of objects. We already have 'format fatigue', moving, in music for example, from vinyl to cassette, to CD and then finally losing interest. As consumers we travel from insatiable to discerning and then become saturated.</p> <p>At the same time as becoming jaded consumers, many in the 50-plus group, by choice or circumstance, are marginalised in the workplace and find themselves divorced from what are supposed to be the driving forces in a capitalist society - power and status. According to research, the new greys don't mourn the absence of either. If they have sufficient income and their responsibilities are manageable, they may become more comfortable with themselves, more spiritual and care less what others think. They have little to prove, so they embark on life as a 'long vacation' and cease to be big spenders.</p> <p>So when will we see these changes in attitudes, priorities and behaviour portrayed in the media, advertising, films and popular culture? When will the fiftysomethings and, for that matter, the sixtysomethings cease to be regarded as embarrassing reminders of waning faculties? When will they be offered not a playpen and an invitation to relive their youth but a truer reflection of their many and varied selves?</p>",

According to a report out this week, Fit and Fifty, not only are today's fiftysomethings breathing unaided, they may well be turning into 'Kevins', casting off jumpers and slippers in favour of clubbing or climbing gear, and - the safest sex of all - learning to love themselves through self-development and 'personal creativity'. Professor Richard Scase of Kent University, one of the co-authors of the study produced for the Government's Economic and Social Research Council, says fiftysomethings are 'adopting more self-focused hedonistic attitudes as they imitate younger ways of living - they expect to retire in their fifties and have another 30 years ahead of them.' The report follows an announcement that BBC2 is to reposition itself and target a 35- to 55-year-old audience with a more 'mature' (presumably as in 'young mature') format. Over on BBC1, half the nation has been watching silver-haired folk fornicating on EastEnders, and suddenly, old - as in 50-plus - is no longer deemed ugly, toothless, sexless, incontinent, senile, confused and helpless. Yet the way in which the media, the advertising industry and academics are now cackhandedly trying to redefine this age group paradoxically underlines how strong is our continuing obsession with youth. The baby boomers have, of course, struck again. Anthropologist Helen Fisher says: 'They travel through society like a guinea pig moving through a python, changing culture as they grow older.' Note, changing culture - not hankering to turn the clock back to their youth. The baby boomers created the teenager, furnished suburbia with Habitat and have now reached the 'November of the body'. The 50-plus group makes up one in three of the population. By 2040 they will account for half. A proportion of older people will continue to face poverty - particularly women forced to rely on inadequate state and private pensions and those crippled by life-long low pay - but many more will have the cash to amuse themselves to death, if they so choose. Neil Jenner heads the London branch of the marketing firm Senioragency which focuses on the 50-plus group. In Britain, he says, this group has an annual income of \u00a3166bn, and this will rise to \u00a3260bn in 20 years. On average, the 50-plus market has a 30 per cent higher disposable income than the under-50s - yet 90 per cent of all advertising is directed at the young. 'Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!' wrote Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Grey - and that's precisely how it appears in millennium Britain. Youth rules, so ageism is rife. A study published in April discovered that the Government's voluntary code of practice on age diversity is ignored by two out of three employers. The over-35s are paid less, trained less and regarded already as 'off-peak'. Experience counts for little. In Beyond Power, Women, Men and Morals, Marilyn French writes: 'The best intentioned efforts to solve human problems falter or fail because they are dyed in the same patterns of thinking that created the problem.' So the 'problem' of age today is viewed as the absence of youth, and the answer is to bring about its restoration. Hence, marketing to the newly retired as if they were born-again twentysomethings - what Jenner, despairing of the advertising industry's lack of imagination, calls 'the grey surfers'. The obsession with youth underestimates another important difference in the baby boomer generation: people may accrue the same number of years yet be in very different places in their respective life cycles. The parents of today's fiftysomethings courted in their teens, and married in their early twenties, then in their forties saw their own children wed. Then they retired in their sixties. Now, divorce, separation, delayed parenthood, women in the workplace and job insecurity means the traditional cards in the game of Happy Families have been drastically reshuffled. Life has a far less conventional pattern. Men may marry for the first time in their thirties; women may have their first child in their forties. Others may retire 15 years earlier than their parents did. Yet in the arts, media and marketplace the portrayal of fiftysomethings often bears no hint of this change. The 'new' old are either relegated to the walk-in bath and chair-lift zone of life or treated to 'role models' such as Joan Collins and Cliff Richard, time bandits frozen at 40. Perhaps revenge is at hand. Soon the 50-plus age group will make up the majority of consumers - and what will the admen do then? Kath Harris, associate director of RDSi, which undertakes 'grey market studies', this month published a report on the common characteristics of the nouveau grise whom, she concedes, do not profess a desire to be forever young. Harris calls the baby boomer grey generation 'a child in time', sandwiched between the austerity of their parents' generation and the consumerism of their children. They dislike the actual process of aging but lack 'ambition or aspiration to acquire consumer goods. Identity is rarely played out through the conspicuous adoption of brands as symbols of what they aspire to be.' In short, they may have the dosh but they have no desire to spend it to keep up with the junior Joneses, or to point up who they are. Perhaps we're about to discover that with longevity may also come a revival of that old hippy resistance to materialism, acquisitiveness and competitiveness? Forecasters such as the Henley Centre tell us that we already live in 'the experience culture' in which knowledge, exploration and exercise matter more than the acquisition of objects. We already have 'format fatigue', moving, in music for example, from vinyl to cassette, to CD and then finally losing interest. As consumers we travel from insatiable to discerning and then become saturated. At the same time as becoming jaded consumers, many in the 50-plus group, by choice or circumstance, are marginalised in the workplace and find themselves divorced from what are supposed to be the driving forces in a capitalist society - power and status. According to research, the new greys don't mourn the absence of either. If they have sufficient income and their responsibilities are manageable, they may become more comfortable with themselves, more spiritual and care less what others think. They have little to prove, so they embark on life as a 'long vacation' and cease to be big spenders. So when will we see these changes in attitudes, priorities and behaviour portrayed in the media, advertising, films and popular culture? When will the fiftysomethings and, for that matter, the sixtysomethings cease to be regarded as embarrassing reminders of waning faculties? When will they be offered not a playpen and an invitation to relive their youth but a truer reflection of their many and varied selves?",

      "body": "<p><strong>I Don't Believe It! The One Foot in the Grave Story/One Foot in the Grave</strong> BBC1 </p> <p><strong> Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</strong> ITV </p> <p><strong>Hidden Love: A Girl's Best Friend</strong> C4</p> <p> <strong>Rory Bremner Special: My Government and I</strong> C4 </p> <p> <strong> Conquistadors</strong> BBC2 </p> <p> Of the five things we British are by law meant to find 'funny' but which are, in fact, significantly less funny than savage rectal polyps, the first three places must go to slapstick, catchphrases and men dressing up as women. (Dennis Norden, since you ask - in twice at numbers four and five, just to be sure.) </p> <p> So it was a shame that BBC1 chose to precede the last-ever episode of One Foot in the Grave with a montage of 'fondly remembered moments' which seemed to consist wholly of Victor turning pratfalls, Victor mouthing his catchphrase and Victor stripping off, if not actually cross-dressing, all inexplicably backwashed by the sound of a flock of geese being sick with laughter.</p> <p> A shame because it was a silly, misleading testament to a more subtle, subfusc, funnier and kinder creation.</p> <p> It was almost impossible to reconcile the endless clips of jokes about pubic hair with the obvious respect accorded the show from the likes of Eric Idle and Paul Merton, and the thoughtful retrospections of Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie (no one, of course, captures Middle England better than middle-class Scots. Think of Tony Blair). The one genuine belly-laugh came tellingly in a borrowed clip from C4's Father Ted, when Dougal and Ted spot Wilson in a crowd and dare each other to ask him to do his catchphrase ('Sure Ted he'll be pleased... I bet no one ever asks him that'). A shame because, despite the moving, awkward final episode that followed, this retrospective showed, again, that BBC1's corporate feel for its audience is clumsy and simplistic. </p> <p> While C4 invites us to enjoy the bovine catchphrase-fixation of Dougal, the loveliest stupid man in the world, BBC1 actually thinks its audience is the most stupid, biddable man in the world, and forgets the nine out of 10 of its viewers - intelligent, complex fans of the show - who are staring at the screen in all faith but not actually laughing. There was also, of course, the grim, self-congratulatory boastfulness now peculiar to this channel. The 'Auntie' nickname has recently confused me: aunts are, likely as not, far more sharp, surprising and knowing than their stereotypes, with secret lesbian lovers and a penchant for Lebanese gold and Hilaire Belloc. BBC2 can still fit the bill. But BBC1 seems increasingly like the fat, spoilt, young cousin in the corner, endlessly banging out 'Chopsticks' with stubby adipocere fingers, badly, and shouting about it between clouds of flatus. </p> <p> And petulant. 'One doesn't want to be cynical,' said a BBC1 insider of the 'fix' that scheduled the first full Who Wants to be a Millionaire? winner against Victor's death.

That stuff's for the prole scum, Chris, the catchphrase crowd.

Maybe not - though I'd love to have seen the graph light up - but this is what we were told by Juliet Stevenson as she drily narrated A Girl's Best Friend, a rather well-made, if ultimately unhelpful, documentary on what used to be known as marital aids and which now come in astonishing designer shapes and sizes (including several blue ones which seemed, mildly disturbingly, modelled exactly on the nose of the old Cresta bear). </p> <p> There was bravery in facing the cameras, particularly from young stroke victim Sue Dobson, who spoke gleefully about the joy in rediscovering her sexuality after six years trying to be a 'proper' - ie numb - disabled woman, laughing before anyone else could at the idea of the 'tart in a cart'. </p> <p> The presentation was light but sensibly devoid of nudges and winks: any humour, other than genuine girly laughter, was quite unintentional.

ITV Hidden Love: A Girl's Best Friend C4 Rory Bremner Special: My Government and I C4 Conquistadors BBC2 Of the five things we British are by law meant to find 'funny' but which are, in fact, significantly less funny than savage rectal polyps, the first three places must go to slapstick, catchphrases and men dressing up as women. (Dennis Norden, since you ask - in twice at numbers four and five, just to be sure.) So it was a shame that BBC1 chose to precede the last-ever episode of One Foot in the Grave with a montage of 'fondly remembered moments' which seemed to consist wholly of Victor turning pratfalls, Victor mouthing his catchphrase and Victor stripping off, if not actually cross-dressing, all inexplicably backwashed by the sound of a flock of geese being sick with laughter. A shame because it was a silly, misleading testament to a more subtle, subfusc, funnier and kinder creation. It was almost impossible to reconcile the endless clips of jokes about pubic hair with the obvious respect accorded the show from the likes of Eric Idle and Paul Merton, and the thoughtful retrospections of Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie (no one, of course, captures Middle England better than middle-class Scots. Think of Tony Blair). The one genuine belly-laugh came tellingly in a borrowed clip from C4's Father Ted, when Dougal and Ted spot Wilson in a crowd and dare each other to ask him to do his catchphrase ('Sure Ted he'll be pleased... I bet no one ever asks him that'). A shame because, despite the moving, awkward final episode that followed, this retrospective showed, again, that BBC1's corporate feel for its audience is clumsy and simplistic. While C4 invites us to enjoy the bovine catchphrase-fixation of Dougal, the loveliest stupid man in the world, BBC1 actually thinks its audience is the most stupid, biddable man in the world, and forgets the nine out of 10 of its viewers - intelligent, complex fans of the show - who are staring at the screen in all faith but not actually laughing. There was also, of course, the grim, self-congratulatory boastfulness now peculiar to this channel. The 'Auntie' nickname has recently confused me: aunts are, likely as not, far more sharp, surprising and knowing than their stereotypes, with secret lesbian lovers and a penchant for Lebanese gold and Hilaire Belloc. BBC2 can still fit the bill. But BBC1 seems increasingly like the fat, spoilt, young cousin in the corner, endlessly banging out 'Chopsticks' with stubby adipocere fingers, badly, and shouting about it between clouds of flatus. And petulant. 'One doesn't want to be cynical,' said a BBC1 insider of the 'fix' that scheduled the first full Who Wants to be a Millionaire? winner against Victor's death. So why give cowardly anonymous press briefings?

Dallapiccola's The Prisoner (1949) formed the major part of a new triple bill. The other two works were not operas. One was a version of a film score, the other a group of folk songs for solo voice. Not that we need be strait-laced about terminology. Opera is a word of vague origin covering a multitude of sins and inviting a variety of spin.

This year, as part of the centenary of Verdi - who wrote nearly 30 operas - they will stage his Requiem. Not that the Latin Mass doesn't have its strengths as a libretto. Why stop there? What about his string quartet, with all those aria-like violin tunes and ominous, off-beat theatrical cello figures? Most opera-goers have probably never heard it.

Here, in the middle of a triple bill, was an orches tral suite of the ballet version of the film score by Nino Rota for Fellini's La Strada.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Gary Numan, at the last count, has enjoyed five career revivals. He's currently riding on the crest of his sixth. Backstage at 'Die Rohre', a gothic metal club in Stuttgart, on Tuesday night, Numan sits swigging Coke from a plastic cup. He looks not dissimilar to his early-Eighties incarnation, those heavy pen-lined eyebrows constantly creased. 'It's great to have a second life,' he says. 'Not many artists get a second chance. And things seem to be going well.' </p> <p>Numan first appeared in the charts in 1979 - with 'Cars' - and his trademark metal machine sound that ushered in the birth of electronica. His subsequent career has provided a series of musical mishaps - buoyed by the periodic re-release of 'Cars'. Still, his music has now been reclaimed by heirs such as DJ Armand Van Helden, The Prodigy's Liam Howlett, The Orb's Alex Patterson and Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor. 'After hearing Gary Numan's 'Cars' on the radio, I knew I wanted to make music with synthesisers,' said Reznor. </p> <p>The patronage of his musical offspring seems to have reinvigorated his artistic temperament. His latest album, Pure, borrows heavily from Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson and Ministry - razor-sharp metal chords sellotaped to his charged vocals. 'I think I'm being true to what I feel,' he says. 'I've not often been like that in the past.' He fidgets with his cup of Coke, and grins meekly, remembering all those recording mis-hits. </p> <p>Numan maintains he has always lacked confidence - and it seems to explain his refuge behind a steely on-stage persona. His 1997 autobiography, Praying To The Aliens, perfectly illustrates the point. </p> <p>Writing about his now-infamous piloting crash in 1982, he describes flying to Cannes as his plane's alternator broke down: 'The alternator was supposed to have been fixed in France but my friend said that, on investigation, it was ridiculously expensive to have it done there, and it would be better to fly it back to England in the same way that we flew to France and fix it there. Again, alarm bells were beginning to ring in my head, but I lacked the confidence to argue.' The light craft crashed on a road near Southampton, stopping two lanes of traffic. </p> <p>'I've never really gotten over that one,' says Numan. 'There were jokes about it for years.' He glances at his stage wardrobe - a black trenchcoat. Hanging from an overhead pipe earlier, Nu-man was forced to move it on discovering a leak in the pipe. He sighs: 'I tell you, this is a bit Spinal Tap, to be honest.

      "bodyText": "Gary Numan, at the last count, has enjoyed five career revivals. He's currently riding on the crest of his sixth. Backstage at 'Die Rohre', a gothic metal club in Stuttgart, on Tuesday night, Numan sits swigging Coke from a plastic cup. He looks not dissimilar to his early-Eighties incarnation, those heavy pen-lined eyebrows constantly creased. 'It's great to have a second life,' he says. 'Not many artists get a second chance. And things seem to be going well.' Numan first appeared in the charts in 1979 - with 'Cars' - and his trademark metal machine sound that ushered in the birth of electronica. His subsequent career has provided a series of musical mishaps - buoyed by the periodic re-release of 'Cars'. Still, his music has now been reclaimed by heirs such as DJ Armand Van Helden, The Prodigy's Liam Howlett, The Orb's Alex Patterson and Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor. 'After hearing Gary Numan's 'Cars' on the radio, I knew I wanted to make music with synthesisers,' said Reznor. The patronage of his musical offspring seems to have reinvigorated his artistic temperament. His latest album, Pure, borrows heavily from Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson and Ministry - razor-sharp metal chords sellotaped to his charged vocals. 'I think I'm being true to what I feel,' he says. 'I've not often been like that in the past.' He fidgets with his cup of Coke, and grins meekly, remembering all those recording mis-hits. Numan maintains he has always lacked confidence - and it seems to explain his refuge behind a steely on-stage persona. His 1997 autobiography, Praying To The Aliens, perfectly illustrates the point. Writing about his now-infamous piloting crash in 1982, he describes flying to Cannes as his plane's alternator broke down: 'The alternator was supposed to have been fixed in France but my friend said that, on investigation, it was ridiculously expensive to have it done there, and it would be better to fly it back to England in the same way that we flew to France and fix it there. Again, alarm bells were beginning to ring in my head, but I lacked the confidence to argue.' The light craft crashed on a road near Southampton, stopping two lanes of traffic. 'I've never really gotten over that one,' says Numan. 'There were jokes about it for years.' He glances at his stage wardrobe - a black trenchcoat. Hanging from an overhead pipe earlier, Nu-man was forced to move it on discovering a leak in the pipe. He sighs: 'I tell you, this is a bit Spinal Tap, to be honest. We do get horribly close to it at times - especially when people talk about my \"specialist audience\".' He paces backstage, absent-mindedly toying with the catering supplies. He and his bandmates discuss the latest Marilyn Manson video. 'Have you seen it? He looks gorgeous. So decadent. That's what millions of sales do for you. I can't even afford a video. Any video would be nice.' Later, on stage, in front of around 300 nu-metal fans, as well as a scattering of goths, Numan's set betrays a weighted emphasis towards his latest album. 'Cars', introduced halfway through, provides an axis for the new material. As his lead guitarist pogos around him, Numan unleashes his neuroses with headbanging judders and flailing arms. Two gigantic banks of keyboards behind him provide a constant electronic hum that underpins his movements. Throughout the 90-minute set, Numan gazes detachedly at the crowd, muttering little beyond 'thank you'. And much like the first time I saw him on Noel Edmond's Multi-Coloured Swap-Shop, in 1980, he looks dislocated from the cheers of his audience.

Once inside, I almost stumbled into a dazed, prone fan, who was being revived after fainting. And she wasn't the only one that found the anticipation all too much.

He started the year as the melodious voice of UK Garage and ends it as that rarest of things: a homegrown soul star. His debut album, Born To Do It , is clearly a British creation. The American-style approach of phat beats and bass lines isn't for him. His record is an inoffensive, sunny confection, sprinkled with Spanish guitar touches and accessible lyrics, squarely aimed at his target audience. </p> <p>And here they are, dressed to impress. And here he is looking slightly low-key in a purple sweat top and black jeans. But this isn't an ostentatious performer or performance. That's not Craig David's style. He is unthreateningly aspirational: nice clothes, smart hair, busy nightlife. But he ain't ghettofabulous. On stage he struts and swaggers around a bit, but his crotch remains a grab-free zone and flashy dance moves just aren't his thing. The audience aren't too nifty on their feet either.

Even on the suggestively titled 'Booty Man' he begins somewhat incongruously singing 'One, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four, step inside the venue.' In fact, his overall stage persona needs a shot of performance Viagra, but it still proves effective in front of such a compliant audience. But this is his town, after all. He could have got up, read out the Southampton phone book and still earned a standing ovation. </p> <p>Craig David is obviously a nice local lad, who judging by his extensive guest list at the door has kept in touch with his old mates. This is just as well because many of his songs feature them, especially the girls. 'She's here tonight,' he teases the lucky laydee who inspired 'Fill Me In' - a tale of teen romance and vigilant parents - when he halts the chart-topping song in mid-flow. 'I met that girl in SOUTHAAAMPTON.' The crowd roars its approval, as it does when he later namechecks some of the city's suburbs. </p> <p>Although his biggest hits, 'Fill Me In' and 'Rewind', are dancefloor fillers, they are kept for the encore. The bulk of the show comprises the album's slower numbers. And on the basis of these it's sometimes hard to see what all the fuss is about. 'Seven Days' and 'Once in a Lifetime' are catchy enough but a few of the others sound like poor relations to The Lighthouse Family. But fans that own and like the album shouldn't be disappointed.</p> <p>He sings all 12 songs from Born To Do It. But it is the middle of the set, when he covers Usher's languid 'Nice and Slow' and R.

The former is a showy ballad that lets his heartfelt voice soar and the latter gives the audience a rare chance to jump up and down as David raps and stomps across the stage. </p> <p>And you have to admire his verbal dexterity as he switches gears from silky singing to fast rhyming on a customised version of his latest single, 'Walking Away'. He performs 'Rewind' accompanied by an acoustic guitar since he's no longer the two-step prince, followed up by a plaintive version of Human League's 'Human' - a strange choice which gets a muted reception. </p> <p>He naturally closes the show, an hour and a half after it began, with 'Fill Me In'. The crowd erupt. 'This is where it all began and I'm gonna keep flying the flag for Southampton.' It's the perfect end to a perfectly satisfactory night.

      "body": "<p>Rem Koolhaas began his career as an architect not by designing a building, but by writing a book. Not the usual kind of architect's book, full of glossy colour pictures of the author's work, but a book of ideas. Delirious Manhattan , as it was called, purported to be a retrospective manifesto, an account of how New York became the embodiment of what Koolhaas describes as 'the culture of congestion'. It was a brilliant move, instantly establishing Koolhaas as an intimidating presence on the architectural landscape when there was nothing to show for what his vision of the architecture of the contemporary world might be like. </p> <p>A second book followed, a couple of bricks thick, that went by the name S, M, X, XL. This time, there were plenty of pictures of Koolhaas's buildings. He had built a couple of houses by then: a conference centre on top of the TGV station in Lille, a dance theatre in the Hague, an art gallery in Rotterdam. But it was even less like the conventional architectural monograph than Delirious Manhattan . Koolhaas's work was depicted as a series of raw cut-and-paste collages, rather than airbrushed perfection. </p> <p>Alongside the buildings were lots of other kinds of images - a fantastic history of Mies's Barcelona pavilion, Japanese pornography, the Berlin Wall - as well as diagrams of the amount of time Koolhaas himself spent in hotel rooms. Clearly the intention was to signal that Koolhaas was about something more important than mere architecture. It did as much as his architecture to make Koolhaas's name inevitably linked with every new project involving the requisite high-octane mix of fashion and celebrity. </p> <p>His architecture is bracing and unsettling and even though nothing he has done yet has had the same popular impact as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim, he is clearly going to be the next big thing. When Ian Schrager decided he wanted a change from Philippe Starck, it was Koolhaas who was his first choice. The surprise was that he is working on the project in partnership with Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Tate Modern. Koolhaas certainly has an ego, but he is not interested in the architectural cult of personality. </p> <p>Miucca Prada has commissioned Koolhaas to design three new stores for Prada in America. But perhaps the most remarkable project Koolhaas is working on is for the Guggenheim Museum. Not content with branches in Venice, Bilbao and Berlin, the director, Thomas Krens, has asked Koolhaas to build a Las Vegas Guggenheim, tacked on to the Venetian, a casino and hotel complex modelled in hyper-real Las Vegas style on the Grand Canal, St Mark's Square, and the Rialto. </p> <p>Such is Koolhaas's strength as an architect that it is impossible to predict from his previous work what any of these new projects will be like. There are clues. You can see an enthusiasm for jagged shapes, the unabashed use of found industrial materials used as if they were precious and beautiful. He makes abrupt juxtapositions between solid and open, between rough and smooth. Koolhaas isn't interested in signature architecture, in making things look pretty, or in hiding from the realities of contemporary life by treating architecture as a craft skill. Why worry about making an elegant fa\u00e7ade, or create a coherent public space, when the world's cities are being overwhelmed by an avalanche of what Koolhaas calls 'junk space'? </p> <p>What really interests Koolhaas is the reality of the contemporary city; that is the subject of Mutations , a spectacular exhibition that he has organised which opened last week at the Arc en Reve in Bordeaux. It is an exploration of the world of shopping malls and airports, of urbanism Lagos and Shenzen style. The message, delivered in Koolhaas's punchy sound bites, is that we had better get on with it, and start to deal with such places as they are, rather than as architects would like them to be. </p> <p>To Koolhaas, the phenomenon of shopping has swallowed the world, making museums and malls and hotels all part of a single chaotic whole. He set his doctoral students at Harvard to work on a three-year study of shopping and concluded: 'The best metaphor for shopping is that of a dying animal - a dying elephant that in its death struggle becomes completely wild and uncontrollable.' </p> <p>The subtext is that Koolhaas is the toughest kid on the block. While most of his fellow professionals wring their hands in horror about theme parks and urban sprawl, he looks the world in the eye and deals with it on its own terms. Talking of the chaos of Lagos, Koolhaas says: 'What I thought would be depressing was powerful, inspiring and brutal.' </p> <p>Brutal, in Koolhaas's vocabulary, is a term of enthusiasm. Indeed, Koolhaas's client, Thomas Krens, uses it to describe the Las Vegas project. Koolhaas is trying to prove that the well-intentioned architects who tried to tame the contemporary city with pedestrian precincts and conservation got it all disastrously wrong. They should have been trying to intensify the city's intrinsic qualities, not neuter them. 'What is amazing is that you can draw a genealogy between Jane Jacobs and Disney. Since the Sixties, the most well-meaning brains in our profession have con tributed to this final, terminal condition of shopping.' </p> <p>The effort to preserve the street, the hostility to the car, the hostility to all those elements that were the inevitable elements of the twentieth century - all of this has somehow created the space for this preservation, and, in the name of preservation, the conversion of entire areas in the centre of the city to fundamentally anti-urban conditions. This ought to make everyone weep. Nobody could have guessed that the twentieth century could end on a Faustian bargain with a mouse. </p> <p>The Las Vegas commission is the project that Koolhaas has always been waiting for, a chance to confront the realities of the contemporary city. The idea of the museum establishing a branch linked to a casino is literally surreal. As Thomas Krens describes it: 'The museum has to make a very powerful statement that cuts right across the main themes of Las Vegas. If you see a city that has embraced artificiality, we will make something that is absolutely the opposite, a very aggressive, even brutal statement.' </p> <p>For Koolhaas, it's the chance to see if he is tough - and brutal - enough to face up to the void that is Vegas, with nothing more than architecture to help him.</p>",

Not content with branches in Venice, Bilbao and Berlin, the director, Thomas Krens, has asked Koolhaas to build a Las Vegas Guggenheim, tacked on to the Venetian, a casino and hotel complex modelled in hyper-real Las Vegas style on the Grand Canal, St Mark's Square, and the Rialto. Such is Koolhaas's strength as an architect that it is impossible to predict from his previous work what any of these new projects will be like. There are clues. You can see an enthusiasm for jagged shapes, the unabashed use of found industrial materials used as if they were precious and beautiful. He makes abrupt juxtapositions between solid and open, between rough and smooth. Koolhaas isn't interested in signature architecture, in making things look pretty, or in hiding from the realities of contemporary life by treating architecture as a craft skill. Why worry about making an elegant fa\u00e7ade, or create a coherent public space, when the world's cities are being overwhelmed by an avalanche of what Koolhaas calls 'junk space'? What really interests Koolhaas is the reality of the contemporary city; that is the subject of Mutations , a spectacular exhibition that he has organised which opened last week at the Arc en Reve in Bordeaux. It is an exploration of the world of shopping malls and airports, of urbanism Lagos and Shenzen style. The message, delivered in Koolhaas's punchy sound bites, is that we had better get on with it, and start to deal with such places as they are, rather than as architects would like them to be. To Koolhaas, the phenomenon of shopping has swallowed the world, making museums and malls and hotels all part of a single chaotic whole. He set his doctoral students at Harvard to work on a three-year study of shopping and concluded: 'The best metaphor for shopping is that of a dying animal - a dying elephant that in its death struggle becomes completely wild and uncontrollable.' The subtext is that Koolhaas is the toughest kid on the block. While most of his fellow professionals wring their hands in horror about theme parks and urban sprawl, he looks the world in the eye and deals with it on its own terms. Talking of the chaos of Lagos, Koolhaas says: 'What I thought would be depressing was powerful, inspiring and brutal.' Brutal, in Koolhaas's vocabulary, is a term of enthusiasm. Indeed, Koolhaas's client, Thomas Krens, uses it to describe the Las Vegas project. Koolhaas is trying to prove that the well-intentioned architects who tried to tame the contemporary city with pedestrian precincts and conservation got it all disastrously wrong. They should have been trying to intensify the city's intrinsic qualities, not neuter them. 'What is amazing is that you can draw a genealogy between Jane Jacobs and Disney. Since the Sixties, the most well-meaning brains in our profession have con tributed to this final, terminal condition of shopping.' The effort to preserve the street, the hostility to the car, the hostility to all those elements that were the inevitable elements of the twentieth century - all of this has somehow created the space for this preservation, and, in the name of preservation, the conversion of entire areas in the centre of the city to fundamentally anti-urban conditions. This ought to make everyone weep. Nobody could have guessed that the twentieth century could end on a Faustian bargain with a mouse. The Las Vegas commission is the project that Koolhaas has always been waiting for, a chance to confront the realities of the contemporary city. The idea of the museum establishing a branch linked to a casino is literally surreal. As Thomas Krens describes it: 'The museum has to make a very powerful statement that cuts right across the main themes of Las Vegas. If you see a city that has embraced artificiality, we will make something that is absolutely the opposite, a very aggressive, even brutal statement.' For Koolhaas, it's the chance to see if he is tough - and brutal - enough to face up to the void that is Vegas, with nothing more than architecture to help him.",

Under the direction of Robin Phillips, Long Day's Journey into Night is expressively, moodily staged and has a shining performance from Jessica Lange. It also has slow, cumbersome stretches. It looks by turns urgent and awkward. </p> <p>O'Neill put his life and family on to the stage in this work: a young man suffering (as did O'Neill) from TB, a brother dead in infancy (bizarrely, the playwright gave this character his own Christian name), an actor father - and a mother whose morphine dependency provides the play's title. The confessional pulse and the frank exploration of addiction give the play - written in 1941, but not produced until 1956 - an unexpectedly contemporary air. Its ripe language and heavy explicitness proclaim it as belonging to its period. The performances are crucial. </p> <p>On this occasion, there's a huge unevenness.

Paul Nicholls, compelling as an impaired, desirable youth in EastEnders, is too robust for the consumptive son. Paul Rudd plays his raffish, troubled brother with too much determination, too little abandon. </p> <p>But Lange is magnificent. As a fog-horn hoots, Simon Higlett's design - a faded traditional sitting-room - is invaded by billows of mist: Lange makes you feel it's her mind that's being infiltrated. With Katharine Hepburn's haughtiness and wobbly grace, she plants the signs of floating away into addiction: a woozy garrulousness; the hands that pick away at a handkerchief. But her bold move, which spreads like fire through the production, is to be dislikeable. She has the manipulativeness of the addict - alternately wheedling and defiant - and the addict's cleverness. She turns wistful moments into barbs: 'I'm sorry,' she says to her husband, as she delivers a harrowing, guilt-inducing memory, 'I remembered out loud.' </p> <p>Remembering aloud proves a dramatic theme of continual fascination at the Cottesloe. At first, Di Trevis's directorial project sounds doomed. She has taken the 1972 screenplay, commissioned by Joseph Losey but never filmed, which Harold Pinter based on A la re- cherche du temps perdu, and collaborated with Pinter in adapting it for the stage. How could Proust's fluidly interior prose not be barbarised? </p> <p>Well, of course, there are oddities and short-cuts in Remembrance of Things Past. The characters - apart from Indira Varma's dreamy, ambiguous Albertine and Sebastian Harcombe's pensive Marcel - are performed with the graphic clarity of cartoon. Stripped of Proust's tumbling clauses, the action is startling, sometimes violent, an act of memory which concentrates on gangs of hoydenish girls and melting, dapper young men, on feasts of snobbery and on casual cruelty. The mad manners and arbitrary rules of this society recall Alice in Wonderland: there is even a guest who dozes off, dormouse-like, at dinner. </p> <p>The shock of this is not a fault but a feat. Trevis and Pinter have wired Proust into an artistic world of unpredictable associations and surrealist nightmares, the world of Ren\u00e9 Magritte. They have not been reverent: they have been truthful. And what they have pulled off is remarkable: they have found, as Raul Ruiz's film Time Regained found, a way to embody Proust's prose. </p> <p>You see this in the seamless opening moments. On Alison Chitty's sloping stage, the narrator broods over his infant self, while around him gilded figures in evening dress watch and wait. There are no separate scenes in this performance, only shifts of focus. An individual starts to play the piano or violin: he (it's always he) freezes, and the music lifts off to reverberate around the auditorium as if it had a thousand sources. In these shifts of register, it is as if characters are passing from one Proustian sentence to another. </p> <p>A new wave of talent is about to hit the English theatre from India. The gorgeous spoof musical Fourteen Songs, Two Weddings and a Funeral returns next year to the Lyric Hammersmith; Andrew Lloyd Webber's Bollywood bonanza will also shortly arrive in the West End. Meanwhile, the descriptions of Indian life, there and here, which have frequently thrown lifelines to the novel, are creeping into plays. </p> <p>The Theatre Royal Plymouth's production of Ash Kotak's Hijra is welcome as part of this wave. Its subject is intriguing and its dialogue peppery. The 'hijra' is an androgynous spell-casting dancer, who falls in love with a young man he meets in Bombay and slips into a sari to get into Britain as his lover's wife: 'Bad bosom day?' enquires his mother-in-law as he fumbles with his falsies. But the jokes aren't frequent enough to paper over the cracks in a jerky plot. And though Charubala Chokshi, who doubles up as two busybodies, is impressive, the acting is unreliable. </p> <p>It takes panache, and a sense of paradox, to make your final production a work in progress. That's what Mick Gordon has done as he leaves a distinguished term as the Gate's artistic director. Love's Work, proclaiming itself unfinished with a stage of bare planks and uncurtained windows through which you glimpse Notting Hill buses and buzz, veers between pathos, terrific comedy and queasy sentiment, as actors tell of clandestine, parental and prematurely cut-off love.

      "body": "<p> When Napoleon died in 1821, Madame Tussaud made a wax model of the emperor on his deathbed. She exhibited the model in her touring waxwork show, and later in the permanent museum she set up in Baker Street in 1835. One of the exhibition's regular visitors was the Duke of Wellington, who would stand over Napoleon's body, gazing at his sometime enemy. Though they could only guess at what was going through his mind, the sculptors at the museum were clearly inspired by these posthumous meetings, since when the Duke died in 1852 they made a model of him as well. He was not depicted in a heroic pose from his celebrated life, but at the scene of this silent battle instead: the Duke of Wellington's waxwork was placed at Napoleon's bedside, where he can still be seen today. </p> <p>The Japanese-born American artist Hiroshi Sugimoto recently photographed the two figures, in beautiful, large format black and white, so that it looks like a painting composed at the time. But at what time? The point of the amalgamated waxworks is that two time-frames are collapsed. Tussaud's diorama is not exactly a fiction, but the facts are not what they seem. When the event depicted occurred, one of the people was alive and the other was dead, already a waxwork. But now they are both lifeless reproductions, and Sugimoto's image complicates the situation further: it is a repro duction of a reproduction of many other reproductions, stretching telescopically, almost to infinity. </p> <p>Sugimoto's portraits, which will be included in a forthcoming show at the Saatchi Gallery entitled I Am a Camera , are some of the cleverest responses to a crisis that has been running a low fever for over a century, and has recently reached something of a peak. What is photography? What is painting? At what point do the media meet? Sugimoto has added traditional wax portraiture to the mix, and constructed undateable images, composite representations, a mish-mash of simulacra. </p> <p>A hundred and fifty years ago, purveyors of the new medium of photography were begging to be accepted in exhibitions of fine art, just as fine art realised it no longer had a duty to report realistically. Now photography seems to have reached some apparently final destination: with the introduction of digital photography and computer manipulation, realism in photography is decidedly dead. Images can be taken to pieces and recomposed thousands of miles away: photography is breaking up, at the very moment photo-based work is taking over the artistic canon. </p> <p>What this means, in the galleries, is that there is a focus on the newly blurred line, or a revisiting of the old blurred line, between painting and photography. At the establishment end of the art world, there is the Whitney Museum in New York, putting on what is, amazingly, the first major retrospective of Edward Steichen's work. Steichen was a turn-of-the-century pictorialist photographer who aimed, along with Alfred Stieglitz, Clarence White and other contributors to the journal Camera Work , to raise the artfulness of their photographs to the level of paintings. It is a premise often thought to be rather reactionary, particularly since parallel advances in painting were so avant-garde, and it seems pertinent that now is the time thought to be ripe for large-scale viewing of these 100 year-old painterly pictures. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the more contemporary end of the art world, I am a Camera , projected as a three-part exhibition, and ostensibly an excuse to exhibit old and new photographic work from the collection, adds up to something like 'Charles Saatchi's travels in hyperrealism'. But what does this now mean? Saatchi has been buying photographic work for some time, and has intensified his purchases recently. The Neurotic Realism show last year included new work by Tom Hunter and Hannah Starkey, still scenes lit with a painter's eye, and also contained the photographs of Paul Smith, apparently artless boys'-night-out shots, in which every participant is played by him. As the new show bears out, approaches to realism divide themselves into two camps - either a painting made more immediate, a thoughtful composition brought to life, or a new take on the snap-happy mess or horror of the everyday. Sarah Jones, Hannah Starkey, Tom Hunter, Craigie Horsfield, though very different photographers, fall into the first category, while Richard Billingham, Paul Smith, Nan Goldin and Jessica Craig-Martin fall into the latter. </p> <p>Somewhere in the middle is Tierney Gearon, a photographer whose work has never been exhibited before. As a middle-class, jet-set divorc\u00e9e, Gearon has a cachet directly opposed to that of Richard Billingham, whose work was shown in the Sensation exhibition. She portrays the world of her children (by the pool, on a skiing holi day) as if she were just taking family snaps, but the pictures are creepy, coordinated, elegant and weird. A child in Sesame Street underpants looks up in defiance at an old man wearing a crow's face mask; a girl posing as if to shoot with a gun stands by a dead animal, while her young brother, wearing army fatigues, holds up a fox-head mask. They have none of the technique of Sally Mann and all the wasteland-ish aura of a film by Dennis Hopper or Terrence Malick. But, rather importantly, I am a Camera includes work in oils. Richard Billingham has said that he originally took the pictures in his series 'Ray's a Laugh' as studies for paintings, but stopped at the photographs. Jason Brooks has gone all the way - turned photographs into monumental oils, drawn up on a grid and reproduced in their most minute detail. </p> <p>If Brooks's paintings are copies of photographs, then Sugimoto's portraits are their diametrical opposite. His portraits of Henry VIII and his wives were taken against black backdrops in Madame Tussaud's. The prints are large, the light soft and the blacks rich, so that they look like painted imitations of Holbein paintings, or photographs of Holbein paintings, which is, presumably, what Tussaud's used as a basis for the waxworks. As with the picture of Wellington and Napoleon, there is a game being played - what kind of representation is this, and at how many removes are we from the subject?</p> <p>In an interview published in a book of Sugimoto's portraits, the artist comments that Holbein played a role similar to the one a photographer might play now. When the king wanted to know what Anne of Cleves looked like, he sent Holbein to paint her portrait for him, the way you might ask for a photograph through a dating agency. So Sugimoto is bringing Holbein up to date, turning him into the photographer he would have been in the twenty-first century, or, on the other hand, projecting himself backwards, via the photograph and the waxwork and the original Holbein portrait, into the position of a sixteenth-century court painter in oils. Jason Brooks's paintings and Sugimoto's photographs, put together, are like a riddle about the current state of painting and photography. It is as if the only answer to the crisis is a question, or a joke. 'Does it matter what we're made of,' the images ask their viewer. 'Can you tell?' What was once an academic rivalry has been diffused into a game, and the artist always has the last laugh. </p> <p>Among his portraits, Sugimoto has reproduced Vermeer's famous painting, The Music Lesson . He found a three-dimensional replica of it at Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam, and set out to return it to two dimensions, to make a replica of the replica. But first he had to study the painting carefully, in order to discover Vermeer's exact point of view. In the tilted mirror on the wall above the woman's head, he saw the bottom corner of an easel. Having decided where the artist was standing, he positioned himself identically in relation to the wax models. Sugimoto's version bears an uncanny resemblance to the original painting. Only instead of an easel in the mirror, there is the bottom corner of a photographer's tripod. </p> <p>\u0095 Sugimoto Portraits is published by Abrams at \u00a338. 'I Am A Camera' opens at the Saatchi Gallery on 18 January. The Edward Steichen Retrospective is on at the Whitney Museum in New York until 4 February.</p>",

A child in Sesame Street underpants looks up in defiance at an old man wearing a crow's face mask; a girl posing as if to shoot with a gun stands by a dead animal, while her young brother, wearing army fatigues, holds up a fox-head mask. They have none of the technique of Sally Mann and all the wasteland-ish aura of a film by Dennis Hopper or Terrence Malick. But, rather importantly, I am a Camera includes work in oils. Richard Billingham has said that he originally took the pictures in his series 'Ray's a Laugh' as studies for paintings, but stopped at the photographs. Jason Brooks has gone all the way - turned photographs into monumental oils, drawn up on a grid and reproduced in their most minute detail. If Brooks's paintings are copies of photographs, then Sugimoto's portraits are their diametrical opposite. His portraits of Henry VIII and his wives were taken against black backdrops in Madame Tussaud's. The prints are large, the light soft and the blacks rich, so that they look like painted imitations of Holbein paintings, or photographs of Holbein paintings, which is, presumably, what Tussaud's used as a basis for the waxworks. As with the picture of Wellington and Napoleon, there is a game being played - what kind of representation is this, and at how many removes are we from the subject? In an interview published in a book of Sugimoto's portraits, the artist comments that Holbein played a role similar to the one a photographer might play now. When the king wanted to know what Anne of Cleves looked like, he sent Holbein to paint her portrait for him, the way you might ask for a photograph through a dating agency. So Sugimoto is bringing Holbein up to date, turning him into the photographer he would have been in the twenty-first century, or, on the other hand, projecting himself backwards, via the photograph and the waxwork and the original Holbein portrait, into the position of a sixteenth-century court painter in oils. Jason Brooks's paintings and Sugimoto's photographs, put together, are like a riddle about the current state of painting and photography. It is as if the only answer to the crisis is a question, or a joke. 'Does it matter what we're made of,' the images ask their viewer. 'Can you tell?' What was once an academic rivalry has been diffused into a game, and the artist always has the last laugh. Among his portraits, Sugimoto has reproduced Vermeer's famous painting, The Music Lesson . He found a three-dimensional replica of it at Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam, and set out to return it to two dimensions, to make a replica of the replica. But first he had to study the painting carefully, in order to discover Vermeer's exact point of view. In the tilted mirror on the wall above the woman's head, he saw the bottom corner of an easel. Having decided where the artist was standing, he positioned himself identically in relation to the wax models. Sugimoto's version bears an uncanny resemblance to the original painting. Only instead of an easel in the mirror, there is the bottom corner of a photographer's tripod. \u0095 Sugimoto Portraits is published by Abrams at \u00a338. 'I Am A Camera' opens at the Saatchi Gallery on 18 January. The Edward Steichen Retrospective is on at the Whitney Museum in New York until 4 February.",

Five hundred of the million treasures she bought are now at the Hermitage Rooms in Somerset House, beginning with a massive replica of her dinner table from the Winter Palace. Dreamers gazing into its polished surface may think of Catherine at the trencher with her salivating lovers or sparring with Diderot over mounds of beluga. </p> <p>But the table is not there for romantic effect.

Five suites from that stupendous building in St Petersburg have been recreated down to the last doorknob in Somerset House: the scarlet walls, the gold parquet, the chairs of Arctic birch. Catherine's clock ticks from its diamond tower. Her silver wig glistens in the shuttered light.

It is an inventory of wealth that's supposed to add up to a portrait. Here is Catherine's immense silver coffee pot - she liked it industrial strength, one pound of coffee per litre. Here is her Chinese card table - she used diamonds for chips; here's her steel umbrella, so advanced for the eighteenth century. </p> <p>Catherine's reputation as some sort of sexual Messalina is downplayed in the captions but encouraged in some of the portraits. Crowned Empress of All Russia in 1762, after the shockingly swift murder of her husband, Catherine was lavishly portrayed until the end of her days. For her coronation statue, she proffers an orb like some teasing flower, brimming out of her plunging neckline in fulsome d\u00e9colletage . Even in old age, she has an ardent glint in her eye: 'I could not live,' she wrote, 'for a single hour without love.' </p> <p>The lovers are all present and correct - from pretty-boy Lanskoy, 30 years her junior, to Prince Potemkin, a thundering dynamo with sensuous lips and an extravagant head of hair.

The horse, with its girlish mane and pretty hooves, is all coy glances beneath her. </p> <p>No bores, no gluttons, no arrogant jerks: those were Catherine's rules for the Hermitage - any transgressions punishable with a glass of water and some turgid poems.

      "body": "<p> Richard Wilson is having a busy day. The BBC are sending a crew round to his flat in a couple of hours because this evening's One Foot in the Grave is the final one where Victor gets mown down by a car and everyone is excited, not least because ITV are trying to spoil everything by slightly fishily having a woman winning Chris Tarrant's million pounds at exactly the same time. </p> <p>'Clearly they've put it on because of us,' he says, more in resignation than in anger. (Clearly, he is saving his 'I don't believe it!' for the next day, when he sparks a furore in the press over his reported comments that it was a fix. Speaking to me later in the week, he says: 'It's just so suspicious... I just said it was a fix because it looks like one.') Anyway, ahead of Victor's demise this evening, the BBC are also presenting a warm-up obituary special in which Angus Deayton, Paul Merton and other deities of British humour lay bare the hidden mechanism whereby Victor Meldrew makes us laugh and provide us with another chance to see the clips that have turned him into a well-known phrase or saying. </p> <p>So, naturally, Wilson has to do his bit, which means being filmed watching his TV death and answering questions on the internet afterwards and trying to live up to everyone else's enthusiasm. He's not complaining, though he does have rather a lot on his plate at the moment. </p> <p>He did point out that, actually, he is in the middle of directing a play. This morning the BBC breakfast news people enticed him down to the studios with the promise that his co-star Annette Crosbie and One Foot in the Grave creator David Renwick would be there too, and wouldn't that be jolly? But it turned out they weren't there too, so he had to be jolly on his own. 'Tricky buggers,' he says.

'Though every time I direct a new play I think, why don't I direct old plays?' </p> <p>'So why don't you direct old plays?' </p> <p>'Oh, because new writing is the chronicle of our times. But it can be tough. And this one is a big piece. But now that we've thrashed it through and cut it and shaped it, we're getting more confident. We've reached the stage where the bits that worry you cease to worry you, which is exciting. What's interesting is to see whether we can hold an audience with quite detailed speeches about music and the blues and all that. And today, for the first time, it didn't sound like long speeches, just stories. To have three characters hold a play this long is quite daring. They're a very good trio, thank God. Very often you might make one mistake in casting, and then it can be not so good. But this time I'm really happy with them all.' </p> <p>They even managed to get someone who can play guitar well enough to pass as a world-class rock star, which I say must be handy. 'Yes it is. For the auditions we said they had to be experts, but then some of them didn't bring their guitars, which was a bit worrying...' He rolls his eyes to the ceiling, which is sugar-frosted with pink rosebuds and cherubs. 'Thomas Beecham used to rehearse his orchestra here,' he says. </p> <p>He'll do some more acting when this project is over. And though he won't exactly mourn Victor's passing, he is grateful for everything the series brought him. He is realistic too about his chances of doing anything that might have anything like the same impact. 'I'm destined to be called Victor for the rest of my life I suppose.' </p> <p>It's odd, I say, that, although he played the old curmudgeon for 10 years, he has yet to reach pensionable age himself. 'Well, I didn't think of myself as old when it started, but now I look in the mirror some days and I think, Jesus...' </p> <p>But he's not that old. He still plays squash at the RAC, a traditional gentleman's club. 'Ladies are allowed in as well,' he adds. This is slightly disappointing because I seem to remember reading somewhere that he preferred a younger, showbiz and media crowd; that he reads Face and GQ and Rolling Stone . I thought he might have been a Groucho man. </p> <p>'Ah, well I'm a member of the Groucho too. I joined the RAC because of the squash and the swimming pool. And I tend to play squash with the younger people, so very often we start off at the RAC Club, because they have very good beer there, and move on later to the Groucho.' </p> <p>He goes to see Man United play with Angus Deayton, who is a mate and fellow supporter. 'I met Angus on One Foot , and he asked if I'd like to come up to the club's boardroom and have lunch and watch the match in the director's box. We were with Alex. We mixed with the players. It's a pretty good way of seeing it.' </p> <p>I'm not sure Roy Keane would approve. </p> <p>What about older friends? 'Older people tend not to go out partying much,' he says. And as for the showbiz crowd: 'Well there's the physical thing - the fact that we work strange hours. But the other thing about actors is that by and large they are very good fun to be with - very generous spirited as a group.' </p> <p> I tell him that I also read that as a theatre actor he won't do matinee performances - is that because he stays up too late? He laughs. 'I get terrible stick for that. But the reason I don't do too much theatre is the way it takes your life over. And eight shows a week is really tough. My feeling is that in matinees there's hardly ever anyone there. It's just a device to make money. So it's not laziness on my part, it's just wanting to do the best show, to do good work. A lot of traditionalists would think it's disgraceful, but if you've got the power to refuse why not? Actors hate matinees.' </p> <p>What about films? Well he likes films. He has a passion for foreign films - especially Japanese ones, which loses me for a while as he enthuses about Kurosawa and Ozu and other household names (in Kyoto). He's quite sniffy about Hollywood, though. 'I don't regard the American cinema as having contributed very much,' he says. </p> <p>This strikes me as a bit harsh. There must be some American films he likes surely? </p> <p>'Well yes, of course...' </p> <p>Has he seen one recently? He has a think. He starts telling me about a German one he saw on video, which hardly counts. </p> <p>'To tell you the truth I don't go to the cinema much. I can't stand the adverts and people do tend to goggle a bit. But hang on... what's the one with the plane in the snow when the survivors find the money?' </p> <p>'Is this the one where they have to eat each other?' I ask. </p> <p>'No, no, there's an American actor in it.' </p> <p>'Er... George Clooney?' </p> <p>'No. But I did quite like one George Clooney film. Now what was it...' </p> <p>' Batman ?' </p> <p>'No, no. And not the new one...' </p> <p>It turns out that I don't get out to the cinema much either. I ask whether he has any ambitions to do films himself. He looks doubtful. 'It takes so long to set up. In theatre you can work with the actors for four or five weeks at a stretch and you're in control. But as soon as you direct a film you have 18 different departments all trying to get it right. And then you can work on a film for two years and the producers come along and take your name off it.' As for movie acting, he says: ' I did Passage to India and things like that. I would have liked to have done more film but it never happened. I became a comedy television actor. I'm quite pragmatic in terms of looking at myself as a comic character. Though if someone was going to offer me a large movie role I wouldn't say no.' </p> <p>For all his interest in hanging out at the Groucho and larging it at Old Trafford with Angus, his values are old school.

      "bodyText": "Richard Wilson is having a busy day. The BBC are sending a crew round to his flat in a couple of hours because this evening's One Foot in the Grave is the final one where Victor gets mown down by a car and everyone is excited, not least because ITV are trying to spoil everything by slightly fishily having a woman winning Chris Tarrant's million pounds at exactly the same time. 'Clearly they've put it on because of us,' he says, more in resignation than in anger. (Clearly, he is saving his 'I don't believe it!' for the next day, when he sparks a furore in the press over his reported comments that it was a fix. Speaking to me later in the week, he says: 'It's just so suspicious... I just said it was a fix because it looks like one.') Anyway, ahead of Victor's demise this evening, the BBC are also presenting a warm-up obituary special in which Angus Deayton, Paul Merton and other deities of British humour lay bare the hidden mechanism whereby Victor Meldrew makes us laugh and provide us with another chance to see the clips that have turned him into a well-known phrase or saying. So, naturally, Wilson has to do his bit, which means being filmed watching his TV death and answering questions on the internet afterwards and trying to live up to everyone else's enthusiasm. He's not complaining, though he does have rather a lot on his plate at the moment. He did point out that, actually, he is in the middle of directing a play. This morning the BBC breakfast news people enticed him down to the studios with the promise that his co-star Annette Crosbie and One Foot in the Grave creator David Renwick would be there too, and wouldn't that be jolly? But it turned out they weren't there too, so he had to be jolly on his own. 'Tricky buggers,' he says. 'I think they just said that to get me in.' I half expect him to switch on the Victor for this but he doesn't. For the grumpiest man on TV, he's pretty laid back. He laughs a lot. He's amusingly at the right side of self-effacing. He doesn't scowl or sulk or purse his lips. And he's not Victor at C&amp;A. He wears jeans, trainers and a colourful stripy jumper. We're sitting in the ballroom of the improbably grand HQ of the train drivers' union Aslef in Hampstead, where he is rehearsing a new play for the Royal Court - a three-hander by Stephen Jeffreys called I Just Stopped By to See the Man . The story, set in the Seventies, ricochets between a legendary Mississippi blues guitarist who is presumed by the world to be dead but isn't, his college-educated daughter who has abandoned frontline black politics to come back to their dirt-poor shotgun shack in the Delta and a white English rock star who drops in one dark night to unburden his soul and get to the bottom of theirs. The themes are big and provocative. It's a long way from net curtains and mug trees, and I wonder whether this isn't Wilson's refuge not just from acting but from primetime comedy in particular. I wonder, for all that One Foot is rich and idiosyncratic in its way, whether it is the burden of popularity that goads him to more cerebral adventures. Not so.

The paper ran a top scoop last week revealing that David Moulsdale, founder of the Optical Express spectacles chain, who is worth an estimated \u00a3100 million, was to attend the funeral of murdered Glasgow gangster Tony McGovern. </p> <p>The night before the story appeared Moulsdale won top prize at a Glasgow charity dinner: 'Be the editor of the Sunday Mail for a day'.

He is a national treasure who adds enormously to the gaiety of the nation, but he does go about buying houses and objects, clothes and gewgaws as if he were Citizen Kane or some weird shopaholic left over from the Eighties.</p> <p>His conspicuous consumption is a million miles removed from the new luxury that is the trademark of today's multimillionaires. A handful of recent images must have told even the most obtuse observer of the lifestyle scene that notions of luxury ain't what they used to be.</p> <p>There was Bill Gates on television, no longer quite the richest man in the world, but still so rich that few of us, if challenged, could get the noughts quite right - he was wearing an eye-popping collection of ramshackle clothing.</p> <p>Then there were the photographs of the two would-be US Presidents, both doing their best to look purposeful and worthy holders of America's highest office, and what did their style gurus wheel them out in? Identical chinos and blue cotton shirts, that's what. And then there was Rupert Murdoch, no Johnny-come-lately dotcom millionaire, after all, trolled out in a fine black rollneck sweater instead of a Huntsman suit and a Jermyn Street shirt.</p> <p>In their visual imagery, all four photographs sent out an unambiguous message: not only have the tastes and habits of the rich changed, but they are changing so fast that only the most agile have a hope of keeping up. New money isn't spending its money the way old money did, and even old money is changing its ways in the face of the demographic upheaval that new money is causing.</p> <p>To the vast luxury-goods industry, which earns its fat living catering to the needs and whims of the rich, it sends out some challenging signals: it is clear notice that all the rules have changed, that it's time to forget making the things you've been accustomed to making since time began. You'd better start anticipating - and fast - what the new rich might want before somebody else gets there first. Getting it right adds up to unimaginable riches; getting it wrong means a takeover, a putsch, at worst, oblivion.</p> <p>The problem with trying to define new luxury, though, is that the rules aren't all in place yet. New money doesn't give a toss for many of the old totems of wealth. New money prefers chinos and polo shirts to Savile Row suits, minimalist pads to chandelier-hung mansions, hanging out with pals to white-tie charity dos. New money is fast redefining the parameters of modern luxury - more youthful, more fun and, above all, more subtle. It's not about show and it's not about swank. Stealth wealth is what it's called. Stealth wealth does not mean a diminution of luxury or quality, merely a recognition of where it truly resides. It isn't about cutting back, as it means spending when it really matters, but not bothering when it doesn't. It's about private pleasure as opposed to public swank. It's about wearing the fur on the inside of your coat and never opting for the flash and dash of a Versace number. The new rich don't want to show off so much as enjoy their carefully amassed fortunes.</p> <p>Stealth wealth is not about spending less (the irony is that it can very often cost a great deal more), but the power and the swagger are subtler. A minimalist pad by John Pawson may look as austere as a monk's cell, but believe me, it doesn't come cheap. As Donald Trump pointed out in a recent interview: 'In the Eighties, you drove around in a limousine and now you drive around in a vehicle that is supposed to look like a Jeep - you know, non-conspicuous - but which actually costs four times more than the limousine.'</p> <p>So this new luxury is a much more complicated business than the old. Old luxury had very clear agendas. It was supposed to provide a cocoon of comfort for those lucky enough to be able to afford it, but its more serious function was to separate the seriously rich not only from the poor, but also the merely well-heeled. It was also perfectly permissible for old luxury to be conspicuous. That was part of the point. The problem today, as the economist James Sproule puts it 'is not that you don't have enough, it's that other people have too much'. In other words, now that every clubber can wear a T-shirt by Dolce e Gabbana, have the Prada shoes, the table at the Ivy, and long-haul holi days are available to so many, what are the truly rich to do?</p> <p>If you want to know, watch the Goldman Sachs partners at play, an absorbing study in how times have changed. A Casio watch (\u00a360 for a standard G-Shock), we are reliably informed, is the watch of choice for the firm's chief executive, a man whose annual salary is more than most people earn in a lifetime.</p> <p>Their wives take pride in spending in an anonymous 'below the parapet' kind of way; they have large and beautifully furnished houses, but the look is never 'showy'. They dress impeccably, but never swankily. You will note that snobbery has not been removed from the matter of luxury, more that new, subtler, more complicated snobbisms have arisen.</p> <p>The difference is that while any fool can spend millions on expensive objects, spending money the new way takes more than dosh, it takes insider knowledge, sophistication. The new spender likes to feel he's right in there on the inside track, discovering things long before hoi polloi. One type of olive oil may seem much like another, but stealth wealth means knowing whether cold-pressed extra virgin from the groves of Liguria is better than virgin oil from southern Greece. To be one of the new luxury purists, you not only have to buy the very best, but know what the very best is.</p> <p>Insider information is where the new snobbery really comes into its own. It's being the first to get to the new hide-away luxury lodge; it's knowing a small profumeria in Florence where you can get scents made to order; it's discovering a craftsman who makes handbags in finest calf which are infinitely more desirable than a seen-everywhere, high-profile label.</p> <p>It's knowing why Alessi kettles, iBooks or tables by Christian Liaigre are better than their rivals. It's finding the small shop that imports the finest teas, knowing why Blue Mountain coffee is judged to be the best in the world. New luxury isn't for the lazy.</p> <p>It is, however, for the pure of mind; for those who are anti-branding and pro-green; who do not want the products around them to carry an instantly recognisable label that speaks of some big corporation in the background (whether that be Levi's, Versace or Coca-Cola); and who do not want to feel guilt pangs every time they drive a car that guzzles gas or taste a chicken that's been battery-farmed. If you spend your money on the right things, you're telling the world that you're not just rich, you're also enlightened.</p> <p>These are all matters I've been considering ever since, a few months ago, I joined a group of men who have formed a company called Quintessentially. Its sole aim is to deliver luxury, wherever it is to be found, to its members. So far as we knew, nobody had put together a company solely committed to this sort of new millennium luxury.</p> <p>But how, we had to ask each other, did we define luxury today? What did we want to deliver? What would appeal to the kind of sophisticated, educated, cultured members of Quintessentially we had in mind? Interestingly, although we are of very varied ages and come from very different backgrounds, we shared an extraordinarily cohesive point of view. Mostly, our ideas of what modern luxury is about centred on simple things done quite beautifully - olive oil, but it had to be the best estate-bottled, cold-pressed virgin olive oil; the finest soap, triple-milled and perfumed only with essential oils or herbs; first-class mature cheddar; and the best-quality white linen sheets, finely hem-stitched.</p> <p>Things that even the poorest might once have taken for granted - space, quiet, tranquillity, pure water - are luxuries these days.

And proper candles, divine scents, cashmere sweaters, fresh flowers and good wine. For us, though, the ultimate new luxury had to be time and service.

      "body": "<p>I am translated. The house opposite the Poet's is mine. Love has triumphed over estate agents, mortgage companies, surveyors, combative solicitors and my own hard-won insistence on a solitary existence.</p> <p>Nothing more than a narrow tarmacadamed road separates me from having to admit that I am living with someone. London is my past, Cambridge is my present. The future has been repeatedly defined by the builders and decorators I've contacted as 'not before Christmas', and even that's further than I care to see right now.</p> <p>Anxious metropolitan friends phone and ask about the state of my spirit/soul/psyche/brain chemistry (depending on their specialisms). I shriek with laughter from the floor of what will be my workroom, what is my workroom as I write this, deskless, chairless, empty of everything but a cushion (squirrelled from the Poet's sofa), a laptop and a phone.</p> <p>The state of my inner life is for some later, barely imaginable time when I am not finding and negotiating with and co-ordinating plasterers, joiners, carpet fitters, kitchen installers, bathroom renovators, painters and removal vans. There is no time for wondering if I have just made the worst mistake of my life in leaving the only place I've ever known, or if just the one Prozac a day will keep the lurking palpitations at bay.</p> <p>The mysteries of love pale into insignificance beside decisions about exactly what kind of off-white the walls should be, and whether or not I want to have a wok burner on my new oven (I do, I really do, it turns out). So far the catflap has been fitted - the first priority - a teapot and kettle bought, my floor-level work place set up, and the whereabouts of John Lewis (alias Robert Sayle in these parts) established. I can stroke my traumatised cats, drink gallons of tea, get on screen the book I'm supposed to be working on and then turn it off, and madly order household items I will regret when they are delivered.</p> <p>All life's other necessities go on across the road in the Poet's kitchen, bathroom, TV room and bedroom. But as to what all this means in any meaningful way, I cannot say. Ask me the drop required for the blinds in the living-room, and I will give you them to the nearest centimetre. Wonder about the relative virtue of twist pile or velvet carpeting and I will provide you with an elegant thesis on the subject. Query the optimum wattage for a fast-flowing shower and I will clear the matter up for you in a trice.</p> <p>But ask me how I feel about having moved in order to be with a particular person, ask me about love, ask me about the nature of relationships and you might as well be speaking to me in Old Norse. This may be a kind of shell-shock, a deep traumatic reaction, but I've lost all language for things which are not practical and palpable.</p> <p>There is a kind of reduced dialogue of emotions between the Poet and myself. We sit together, and after a period of silence, one of us will say: 'Are you OK?' The other tenses slightly before offering a clipped: 'Fine. You?' 'Mmm, fine.' This delicate investigation into each other's interior well-being is supplemented sometimes in the middle of the night, when one of us wakes up, nudges the other, and asks: 'Is everything all right?' 'Mmm, fine. Everything all right with you?' 'I'm fine.' So, everything's fine.</p> <p>Love notwithstanding, we are living or partly living in a hiatus between normalities. At some point, the painters, plumbers and plasterers having left, there will no choice but to acknowledge that real life has started once again. Right now, life is an ongoing emergency, a waiting time, a series of appointments to be kept, deliveries to be made, when no one can tell what they feel about the way things are, because nothing has finished and nothing has started.</p> <p>As with the improbability of late love having descended so gratuitously, the Poet and I should be thankful for the experience of turmoil at a time when most people are beginning to go into mourning for the loss of the chance of further turmoil in their lives.</p> <p>But perhaps what causes our monosyllabic reaction to our new condition is not the chaos of the present, but fear of the return to the regular. What if contentment turns out to be the last thing we want? It's never been a state I've much admired, mostly because I don't think I have come across it much in others (ever, I might almost say), but also because I've always doubted that contentment is very good for people. It is no surprise to me that the fairy stories end with living happily ever after while refusing to give the slightest clue as to what that might be like. What would you think if when you asked someone how they were, they replied 'Happy'? Probably that they needed counselling.</p> <p>What if, once the carpets are down and there are sofas to sit on, happily ever after awaits the Poet and me? Just as with death, sentimentalists and moralists have concocted fantasies about what happiness might be like, but no one I've heard of has ever returned from that place to confirm or deny the speculations. Well, we'll just have to wait and see. Maybe, in time to come, as your intrepid reporter of the ancient heart, I'll be in a position to report back on the matter one way or another.</p> <p>\u0095 Margaret Cook returns next week</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am translated. The house opposite the Poet's is mine. Love has triumphed over estate agents, mortgage companies, surveyors, combative solicitors and my own hard-won insistence on a solitary existence. Nothing more than a narrow tarmacadamed road separates me from having to admit that I am living with someone. London is my past, Cambridge is my present. The future has been repeatedly defined by the builders and decorators I've contacted as 'not before Christmas', and even that's further than I care to see right now. Anxious metropolitan friends phone and ask about the state of my spirit/soul/psyche/brain chemistry (depending on their specialisms). I shriek with laughter from the floor of what will be my workroom, what is my workroom as I write this, deskless, chairless, empty of everything but a cushion (squirrelled from the Poet's sofa), a laptop and a phone. The state of my inner life is for some later, barely imaginable time when I am not finding and negotiating with and co-ordinating plasterers, joiners, carpet fitters, kitchen installers, bathroom renovators, painters and removal vans. There is no time for wondering if I have just made the worst mistake of my life in leaving the only place I've ever known, or if just the one Prozac a day will keep the lurking palpitations at bay. The mysteries of love pale into insignificance beside decisions about exactly what kind of off-white the walls should be, and whether or not I want to have a wok burner on my new oven (I do, I really do, it turns out). So far the catflap has been fitted - the first priority - a teapot and kettle bought, my floor-level work place set up, and the whereabouts of John Lewis (alias Robert Sayle in these parts) established. I can stroke my traumatised cats, drink gallons of tea, get on screen the book I'm supposed to be working on and then turn it off, and madly order household items I will regret when they are delivered. All life's other necessities go on across the road in the Poet's kitchen, bathroom, TV room and bedroom. But as to what all this means in any meaningful way, I cannot say. Ask me the drop required for the blinds in the living-room, and I will give you them to the nearest centimetre. Wonder about the relative virtue of twist pile or velvet carpeting and I will provide you with an elegant thesis on the subject. Query the optimum wattage for a fast-flowing shower and I will clear the matter up for you in a trice. But ask me how I feel about having moved in order to be with a particular person, ask me about love, ask me about the nature of relationships and you might as well be speaking to me in Old Norse. This may be a kind of shell-shock, a deep traumatic reaction, but I've lost all language for things which are not practical and palpable. There is a kind of reduced dialogue of emotions between the Poet and myself. We sit together, and after a period of silence, one of us will say: 'Are you OK?' The other tenses slightly before offering a clipped: 'Fine. You?' 'Mmm, fine.' This delicate investigation into each other's interior well-being is supplemented sometimes in the middle of the night, when one of us wakes up, nudges the other, and asks: 'Is everything all right?' 'Mmm, fine. Everything all right with you?' 'I'm fine.' So, everything's fine. Love notwithstanding, we are living or partly living in a hiatus between normalities. At some point, the painters, plumbers and plasterers having left, there will no choice but to acknowledge that real life has started once again. Right now, life is an ongoing emergency, a waiting time, a series of appointments to be kept, deliveries to be made, when no one can tell what they feel about the way things are, because nothing has finished and nothing has started. As with the improbability of late love having descended so gratuitously, the Poet and I should be thankful for the experience of turmoil at a time when most people are beginning to go into mourning for the loss of the chance of further turmoil in their lives. But perhaps what causes our monosyllabic reaction to our new condition is not the chaos of the present, but fear of the return to the regular. What if contentment turns out to be the last thing we want? It's never been a state I've much admired, mostly because I don't think I have come across it much in others (ever, I might almost say), but also because I've always doubted that contentment is very good for people. It is no surprise to me that the fairy stories end with living happily ever after while refusing to give the slightest clue as to what that might be like. What would you think if when you asked someone how they were, they replied 'Happy'? Probably that they needed counselling. What if, once the carpets are down and there are sofas to sit on, happily ever after awaits the Poet and me? Just as with death, sentimentalists and moralists have concocted fantasies about what happiness might be like, but no one I've heard of has ever returned from that place to confirm or deny the speculations. Well, we'll just have to wait and see. Maybe, in time to come, as your intrepid reporter of the ancient heart, I'll be in a position to report back on the matter one way or another. \u0095 Margaret Cook returns next week",

      "body": "<p> Let's look at the evidence. 'Loads of cookbooks, none used apart from a well-thumbed version of Claudia Roden's Book of Middle Eastern Cookery . A Boston Red Sox baseball cap. And, oh, what else can I say... mmm, a bicycle, probably, although I'm not very well known for being a bicyclist. Not even by my local bike shop. So... let's say a television set.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, we're having to make do with a Loyd Grossman's take on his Fulham house, because he doesn't like the idea of me visiting him there. 'Thanks to the Hunter S. Thompson school of journalism,' he says, 'the interview begins the moment someone walks down the street and notices the empty crisp packet blowing across the pavement.' </p> <p>So the idea of a stranger coming and poking around in your house is abhorrent to you, is it, Loyd? </p> <p>Loyd snuffles. 'Heugh, heugh, heugh. Yeugh, it's not my thing particularly.' </p> <p>Loyd, who is best known for snooping around the homes of C-list celebs on Through the Keyhole and snacking on overwrought dishes on Masterchef , has just been appointed consultant to the government review of the NHS menu. Though the move has earned him the extravagant tabloid sobriquet of Hospital Food Tsar, this is essentially an administrative role. which gives health minister Alan Milburn droit du seigneur over his address book. Since Loyd spent 10 years on Masterchef before resigning this summer - he objected to the show being moved to BBC2, and becoming more of a food programme than a cook-off - he has connections with most celebrated spatula-wavers. </p> <p>Loyd has already rung up six top chefs, including chaps from the Ivy and the Savoy, and all have agreed to visit the kitchens of various hospital trusts. Their comments will lay the foundation for his 'very small paper', which in turn will be debated by dietitians and caterers, 'and in January we'll all get together for a big session. By mid-April, everyone will have agreed on what the foundation of the new NHS menu will be.' </p> <p> It is, on the face of it, an unlikely appointment. Some commentators have suggested that it is a prime example of New Labour spin, but as Loyd himself points out: 'If it was intended to be a publicity stunt, they could have got hold of someone a lot better than me to be the fall guy.' Unlike the Jamies and the Nigellas, Loyd - and one can't help wondering occasionally whether this is something he solemnly plays up to - is something of a national figure of fun. His accent, as conspicuous and unwieldy on these cramped shores as a pink stretch Cadillac, actually seems to gets more pronounced with age. Apparently even Bostonians hear it with disbelief on their faces. </p> <p>And then there is the food issue. We associate Loyd with Rustic Salad of Quail with Wild Mushrooms, with Pistachio Bavarois With Caramelised Bananas, and with spun-sugar baskets: preposterously fussy food for gastronomes, not nutritious hot dinners for invalids. Since factors such as these are working against Loyd, the only conclusion you can draw is that Alan Milburn must have wanted him Real Bad. </p> <p>'We're not coming up with high-falutin ideas,' drawls Loyd, as neat as a seal in his weekend attire of moss-coloured tweed suit, navy cashmere poloneck and long brown brogues, as he sits in a hotel dining room overlooking Hyde Park. 'There's no \"Ghaassh, people's lives will be immeasurably changed if we put raddichio on the NHS menu.\" I know from past experience that it's important to come up with something that is deliverable. Quite often very small changes can make a big difference.' </p> <p>The thing is, if you look closely, there is a certain logic to Milburn's thinking. In recent years, Loyd has discovered a startling talent for bureaucracy. He is a regional commissioner for English Heritage, chair of the Campaign for Museums and a member of the board of the Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries (mostly low- or unpaid work financed by his eponymous pasta sauces). 'It has totally taken me by surprise,' he says of his adventures in red tape. 'I never expected to be able to do it even reasonably well. Because I've come to bureaucracy relatively late in life, I aim to get through it with a minimum of fuss and entanglement.' </p> <p>It's also odd because, according to legend, Loyd is not good in groups. 'He lacked team spirit,' an ex-colleague from Harpers &amp; Queen , where he was once design editor, has remarked. 'We used to say that if he'd gone to a British school, he wouldn't behave like that.' Miaow! But Loyd, so well-mannered, so keen not to give himself away, and so fond of superlatives such as 'fabulous' and 'brilliant' and 'fantastic' and 'rehally, REHALLY terrific', has a neat line in sublime bitchiness himself, if pushed. 'It's been her claim to fame for about 12 years,' he sighs. '\"Hi, what I've got to say is that Loyd Grossman isn't a team player.\" Anyway, I do work well with people. I'm always very good with teams. That's why I've been able to work on television for so long, because that's all about teamwork.' </p> <p>In the past, he explains, Caroline Waldegrave, Prue Leith and Claudia Roden have been asked to suggest changes to the NHS menu, with little effect. 'So maybe I won't be able to do it, either. But I can't simply not try because it might not work.' Still, failure would be galling. Will he just sit quietly if his recommendations are ignored? 'No. Because it's not my style. I've been so publicly asked - I would be incredibly irritated, yeugh.' </p> <p> Though Loyd says he is 'incredibly interested in politics', and would have plumped for Gore, albeit 'by a very narrow margin', he never got around to filling in his US postal vote. He will not be drawn on British politics, although his father-in-law, Lord Puttnam, is a Labour peer. 'I ain't going there. I don't want to be trapped in one camp or the other.' </p> <p>Private or NHS, Loyd? 'If it was something major and critical, it would be the NHS.' You don't have private health cover, then? 'Oh, I think I must do. But if it was something important, it would be the NHS.' </p> <p>Milburn's invitation came at the right time, just after the news about Masterchef . Keyhole , extraordinarily enough, is still running after 17 years, but apart from that Loyd has no immediate telly plans. 'I'm talking to people... You know, I did not want to spend my entire television career in the ghetto of lifestyle programming. And thankfully, I think I'm finally making a break.' </p> <p>As he will tell you, Loyd never set out to be on the box. He made the move accidentally when he was at Harpers &amp; Queen and and was asked to appear on a TV-AM slot, deconstructing the soft furnishings of soap stars. Keyhole has a dubious claim to fame: harnessing interiors and the far reaches of celebrity, it was an indication of the future of television. </p> <p> At first, Loyd, the foreigner from an upmarket glossy, was jolly rude, just as the TV producers hoped he would be. He was particularly merciless about the impressionist Faith Brown's sideboard. 'Of course, I don't care what kind of wallpaper anyone has, frankly. It's of so little interest to me,' he says, unconvincingly. 'But I thought it was quite a funny idea. It had a tremendous amount of shock value when it started - up until then, no one had really done a TV programme focusing on lampshades.' But pretty quickly he realised that he felt uncomfortable, and retracted his claws: nowadays he sounds rather like an estate agent, oohing and aahing over horsebrasses and inglenook fireplaces. Still, there is a strange tension between the platitudes and the nasal quality to his voice, which means that his remarks usually sound rather sneery. He was never an obvious candidate for the title of lifestyle king. Watching Masterchef , you felt for him as much as the contestants when the time came for him to tour the kitchens and make agonising small talk: he had the air of a prosecution attorney who had stumbled through the back of the wardrobe when hunting for his horsehair wig. </p> <p>Loyd is quite different in the flesh. On telly, he is remote and arch and a bit of a know-it-all; here, he is cordial, a little shy, slightly prickly, and fairly willing to poke fun at himself. An unabashed aesthete (he orders grapefruit juice, having ascertained first that it is fresh; and, when offered either Earl Grey or English Breakfast, murmurs that what he'd really ad-DORE would be some Lapsang Souchong), yes, but a likeable one. It's not what one expects. Today, though obviously on his guard, he gives the impression of a free man, in comparison to the formal, uptight telly creature I was expecting. So I ask if he feels natural on television. </p> <p>'Yeugh, I feel very... I like it. I like television.' </p> <p>Because, I continue, you always seem quite self-conscious, as if you're never exactly relaxed when you're in front of the cameras. </p> <p>'Probably,' says Loyd, stonewalling. </p> <p>You always seem rather... conscientious , I venture, trying desperately hard not to say 'swotty'. </p> <p>'Yes... maybe conscientious,' agrees Loyd, mutedly. He stares at me, and begins to laugh. I have the nasty feeling he knows exactly where I'm coming from. 'Conscientious! There's an accolade!' </p> <p>I try again. 'Would you say you have a unique presenting style?' </p> <p>'Eugh-eugh-eugh! Oh dear! Go on, say I'm rubbish! Go on!' </p> <p>So I ask him to analyse his UPS, but Loyd, though he is making noises like a resident of Sea World, isn't going to play ball. 'Presumably I'm hired to fill up airtime and entertain a few people,' he says, when the smokescreen has cleared. 'But whether it's my conscientiousness or my sex appeal, I don't want to know.' Certainly, his friends tease him about Keyhole , and his background never pointed him in the direction of the lifestyle ghetto. </p> <p>Loyd grew up in Marblehead, Massachusetts, a seaside town with eight yacht clubs. His father, a Jewish antique dealer who had at one time been a jazz musician, was 59 when he was born in 1950; his mother was in her late thirties. Loyd was introduced to the joys of European history at school, and soon developed a particular fondness for England. While studying history at Boston University, he wigged out over the Stones and the Kinks, and ordered copies of the Who's latest records from Harrods' record department. Later, he played guitar with a band that made number 49 in the charts. He is still an avid pop fan: the last CD he bought was Moby's Play . </p> <p> His other enthusiasm, apart from glossy British magazines, was Victorian architecture. When in 1975 he came to do his Masters at LSE (it was big on his specialism, pre-industrial economic history), he set off on a rather unusual architectural tour. 'I remember seeing this picture of Manchester Town Hall in a book and my mind was just blown away, because I could not believe this incredible palace was a town hall somewhere in the north of England.' After Manchester, his second destination was the Walker art gallery in Liverpool. </p> <p>He has no homing instinct for the States, though the family (he and Debbie have two daughters, Florence and Constance) spend summers there. Loyd has an alien's sentimentality for his adopted country. Rapturously, his eye fastens on the window as the Household Cavalry trots past. 'They do look pretty fabulous, don't they? Now, that is cool.' A few years ago, he became a British citizen. 'It was important to me emotionally. I wanted to prove that I have a stake in the country. Because of my public service work, I thought it was important to let people know that I was on board.' I find myself crossing my fingers that Loyd will not be offered any more telly work. He's much more use to us off it than on.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'He who has the vodka has the power.' Ten days ago, the age-old Russian adage looked tailor-made for Philip Bowman, the ambitious chief executive of drinks giant Allied Domecq, as he snatched the lucrative US rights for Stolichnaya vodka away from arch-rival Diageo. </p> <p>It was Tsar Bowman's second daring coup in as many months. The dying days of October found Allied's helmsman swashbuckling around the Caribbean, readying to loot the good ship Captain Morgan in a pre-emptive strike against Seagram, the rum brand's Canadian owner. </p> <p>Both acts of piracy are but prologues to the main attraction: the \u00a35 billion auction of Seagram's drinks division, the world's third largest spirits and wines operation. The year's most colourful bid saga is now entering its penultimate act, as Seagram's Wall Street adviser Morgan Stanley issues draft sale agreements to the only three serious bidders: Allied Domecq, Diageo in an Anglo-French pairing with Pernod Ricard, and a three-way alliance between Bacardi, Brown Forman - the US owner of Jim Beam bourbon - and Sweden's Vin &amp; Spirit, purveyor of hip 'n' cool Absolut vodka. </p> <p>This weekend, Bowman stands a contract away from being hailed as genius or condemned as a villain. Genius, because Stolichnaya gives Allied a much-needed replacement for Absolut, which intends to repossess its valuable US distribution rights now held by Seagram. And last month's deal with Destiler\u00eda Serralles - the Puerto Rican producer of rum which Seagram sells as Captain Morgan - may not only unsettle its rivals for Seagram but yield Allied the best consolation prize if it loses. If the deal stands up in court, Serralles will claim the Captain Morgan trademark from Seagram and fill the other glaring gap in Allied's drinks cabinet with the world's second-best selling rum behind Bacardi. </p> <p>And villain, because on both counts Bowman may have been too clever by half. If so, he will be accused of losing Seagram and a once-in-a-lifetime chance to keep pace with Diageo. An also-ran Allied might face a bid from the likes of Pernod and deal-hungry venture capitalists. </p> <p>'The stakes couldn't be higher,' one leading City drinks analyst said. 'After these deals, Allied is currently going around institutional investors playing down the need for Seagram. Despite the swagger, that smacks of weakness and lack of confidence that Bowman will win.' </p> <p>The Stolichnaya deal in the States has already prompted rumblings back in mother Russia. Unnoticed by the western press, just 24 hours later a Russian federal body claimed that Allied's partner, Soyuzplodimport (SPI), had no rights to the Stolichnaya brand, stating the trademarks had been illegally privatised. The decision, by the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation, 'jeopardises the results of an international tender for the right to distribute Stolichnaya in the US,' it said, urging the government to seize 'Stoli' and 42 other vodka brands. </p> <p>The timing was hardly coincidental. President Vladimir Putin has been fighting a running battle all year to regain control of Russia's vodka industry and its essential tax revenues. </p> <p>Only a fortnight ago, a 51 per cent stake in Stoli's producer, Moscow's 100-year-old Cristall distillery, was handed over to the Kremlin after it was occupied by armed gangs supporting two rival directors. In May, SPI's Moscow headquarters were also raided by the police's anti-organised crime unit in an investigation into the firm's acquisition of the vodka brands. Cristall, too, has also fought SPI over ownership of export brands. </p> <p>Last week Diageo was eager to stir the pot, prompting another spat with Allied. 'Up to the last minute, they were keen to keep the rights they held for the last 10 years,' an Allied spokesman said. 'It's sour grapes by Diageo.' </p> <p>The full Stoli story, however - which The Observer can now reveal - shows the scope there is for Allied to be dragged into messy Russian and overseas litigation over the vodka brand. </p> <p>The key figure behind Stoli is Yuri Shefler, a 33-year-old, high-living graduate of Moscow State University with a penchant for Monaco. SPI's similarly-named predecessor, Soyuzplodoimport (Old SPI, or literally in Russian 'The Union of Fruit and Vegetable Importers'), had been privatised in 1992 but was poorly managed and quickly fell on hard times. </p> <p>Shefler took over the management reins in 1997 and set up SPI as a new parallel company, which assumed Old SPI's trading and increasingly ran the business via Cyprus, a favoured offshore haven for Russia's business elite. Old SPI used to route exports through its German operation, Plodimex. Since 1998, however, according to Russian sources, this has been wound down, exports have been shipped direct from Moscow and payments handled by three offshore firms: SPI Spirits in Cyprus, SPI Ltd in Gibraltar and SPI NV in the Netherlands. </p> <p>In 1998, confusing matters more, Old SPI also changed its name so now there are two identically named vodka companies registered as Soyuzplodimport in Moscow. Old SPI, the Russian authorities allege, also illegally transferred 43 vodka trademarks to SPI. The price, they claim, was a derisory 1.7 million roubles (\u00a343,500), against the Foreign Trade Ministry's valuation of more than \u00a31bn for Stolichnaya alone. </p> <p>Old SPI's 21 shareholders included its management and Russia's distilleries, including Cristall. The new SPI, however, is controlled by two different firms: Elery, a front for a mystery Russian woman, Yevgena Kocheryzhkina, and Interkatrin Group Corporation, a company registered in Delaware in the US. Who set up Elery and who controls Interkatrin are uncertain.

      "bodyText": "'He who has the vodka has the power.' Ten days ago, the age-old Russian adage looked tailor-made for Philip Bowman, the ambitious chief executive of drinks giant Allied Domecq, as he snatched the lucrative US rights for Stolichnaya vodka away from arch-rival Diageo. It was Tsar Bowman's second daring coup in as many months. The dying days of October found Allied's helmsman swashbuckling around the Caribbean, readying to loot the good ship Captain Morgan in a pre-emptive strike against Seagram, the rum brand's Canadian owner. Both acts of piracy are but prologues to the main attraction: the \u00a35 billion auction of Seagram's drinks division, the world's third largest spirits and wines operation. The year's most colourful bid saga is now entering its penultimate act, as Seagram's Wall Street adviser Morgan Stanley issues draft sale agreements to the only three serious bidders: Allied Domecq, Diageo in an Anglo-French pairing with Pernod Ricard, and a three-way alliance between Bacardi, Brown Forman - the US owner of Jim Beam bourbon - and Sweden's Vin &amp; Spirit, purveyor of hip 'n' cool Absolut vodka. This weekend, Bowman stands a contract away from being hailed as genius or condemned as a villain. Genius, because Stolichnaya gives Allied a much-needed replacement for Absolut, which intends to repossess its valuable US distribution rights now held by Seagram. And last month's deal with Destiler\u00eda Serralles - the Puerto Rican producer of rum which Seagram sells as Captain Morgan - may not only unsettle its rivals for Seagram but yield Allied the best consolation prize if it loses. If the deal stands up in court, Serralles will claim the Captain Morgan trademark from Seagram and fill the other glaring gap in Allied's drinks cabinet with the world's second-best selling rum behind Bacardi. And villain, because on both counts Bowman may have been too clever by half. If so, he will be accused of losing Seagram and a once-in-a-lifetime chance to keep pace with Diageo. An also-ran Allied might face a bid from the likes of Pernod and deal-hungry venture capitalists. 'The stakes couldn't be higher,' one leading City drinks analyst said. 'After these deals, Allied is currently going around institutional investors playing down the need for Seagram. Despite the swagger, that smacks of weakness and lack of confidence that Bowman will win.' The Stolichnaya deal in the States has already prompted rumblings back in mother Russia. Unnoticed by the western press, just 24 hours later a Russian federal body claimed that Allied's partner, Soyuzplodimport (SPI), had no rights to the Stolichnaya brand, stating the trademarks had been illegally privatised. The decision, by the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation, 'jeopardises the results of an international tender for the right to distribute Stolichnaya in the US,' it said, urging the government to seize 'Stoli' and 42 other vodka brands. The timing was hardly coincidental. President Vladimir Putin has been fighting a running battle all year to regain control of Russia's vodka industry and its essential tax revenues. Only a fortnight ago, a 51 per cent stake in Stoli's producer, Moscow's 100-year-old Cristall distillery, was handed over to the Kremlin after it was occupied by armed gangs supporting two rival directors. In May, SPI's Moscow headquarters were also raided by the police's anti-organised crime unit in an investigation into the firm's acquisition of the vodka brands. Cristall, too, has also fought SPI over ownership of export brands. Last week Diageo was eager to stir the pot, prompting another spat with Allied. 'Up to the last minute, they were keen to keep the rights they held for the last 10 years,' an Allied spokesman said. 'It's sour grapes by Diageo.' The full Stoli story, however - which The Observer can now reveal - shows the scope there is for Allied to be dragged into messy Russian and overseas litigation over the vodka brand. The key figure behind Stoli is Yuri Shefler, a 33-year-old, high-living graduate of Moscow State University with a penchant for Monaco. SPI's similarly-named predecessor, Soyuzplodoimport (Old SPI, or literally in Russian 'The Union of Fruit and Vegetable Importers'), had been privatised in 1992 but was poorly managed and quickly fell on hard times. Shefler took over the management reins in 1997 and set up SPI as a new parallel company, which assumed Old SPI's trading and increasingly ran the business via Cyprus, a favoured offshore haven for Russia's business elite. Old SPI used to route exports through its German operation, Plodimex. Since 1998, however, according to Russian sources, this has been wound down, exports have been shipped direct from Moscow and payments handled by three offshore firms: SPI Spirits in Cyprus, SPI Ltd in Gibraltar and SPI NV in the Netherlands. In 1998, confusing matters more, Old SPI also changed its name so now there are two identically named vodka companies registered as Soyuzplodimport in Moscow. Old SPI, the Russian authorities allege, also illegally transferred 43 vodka trademarks to SPI. The price, they claim, was a derisory 1.7 million roubles (\u00a343,500), against the Foreign Trade Ministry's valuation of more than \u00a31bn for Stolichnaya alone. Old SPI's 21 shareholders included its management and Russia's distilleries, including Cristall. The new SPI, however, is controlled by two different firms: Elery, a front for a mystery Russian woman, Yevgena Kocheryzhkina, and Interkatrin Group Corporation, a company registered in Delaware in the US. Who set up Elery and who controls Interkatrin are uncertain. Shefler, meanwhile, has described the Russian authorities' actions as 'extortion'. As the battle continues, however, SPI's structure raises the prospect, Russian sources say, of litigation spilling over into the US as Putin fights to regain con trol of Stolichnaya and much-needed vodka revenues. Allied has certainly not gone into the Stoli deal blind: 'We have not paid a material amount up front,' a spokeswoman said. 'We remain a very conservative company, morally and legally, and would not announce anything unless we believed we were secure.' But Bowman failed to sign up Absolut: the Swedes were concerned about Allied's weak US distribution, one of the reasons Bowman covets Seagram. And if Allied fails to win the Canadian firm, it is hard to see Stoli eating into the lead of Absolut and Diageo's best-selling Smirnoff in the US market. It is the Puerto Ricans, Bowman hopes, who have handed him the trump card in the auction. Founded in 1865 by Don Juan Serralles, the son of a Spanish settler, Destiler\u00eda Serralles supplies Seagram with its Captain Morgan rums from the city of Ponce on the Caribbean island's south coast. With annual sales of more than $100m, including its flagship Don Q rum label, Serralles is one of the US dependency's biggest companies. Until Allied's coup, Seagram and its highly paid advisers had given no attention to the 'change of control' clause in Serralles's supply contract which gives it the right to match the price offered by any other bidder for the Captain Morgan brand. Citing US precedent, which Puerto Rican law follows, the Canadians argue they are rock solid in rebutting any Allied claims. So confident are they that a sale of the shares in the drinks company, Joseph E Seagram &amp; Sons, does not trigger the Serralles clause, they have now offered bidders an indemnity against any legal action by Allied and the Puerto Ricans. Bowman and his gaggle of lawyers, meanwhile, are playing it streetwise. Allied, industry sources say, is putting as much faith in the local clout wielded by Felix Juan Serralles, the Don's great grandson, as legal niceties. 'Serralles is a Puerto Rican company and a pretty big one at that. This will be decided in a Puerto Rican court, by Puerto Rican judges, say no more than that,' one source said. Allied's chief, however, has left Seagram and Morgan Stanley incandescent by trying to put them over a barrel.

      "byline": "Lynn Barber",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Six-thirty and the party-partying begins. Nicky Haslam checks his pockets before leaving his flat. 'Keys, cash, kerchief, comb,' he recites. 'That's what nanny taught me. Cosmetics, cigarettes, cellular phone, coke and cards - that's my own addition.' Then off into the night, equipped with a stack of stiffies and an itinerary of sorts, because there are a lot of parties to get through, and Nicky has to 'look in' at them all before joining friends for dinner.</p> <p>He is sporting the scar on his cheek that will be his talking point for the evening. (My great mistake in life, I realise too late, is never having a talking point at parties.) Nicky's scar comes up to scratch - everywhere we go, women rush up crying, 'Darling Nicky! What happened to you?' And every time he says he's been in this terrible knife fight in Brixton, and every time the women are terribly upset and concerned and then he has to reassure them that it is only a stick-on scar as used in the movies. And all this talking about his talking point takes for ever so that parties simply flash by and you never have time to be bored even though you see the same people everywhere you go. </p> <p>But of course the talking point, the talking point that everyone else talks about is Nicky Haslam. He has achieved the apotheosis of fame whereby he is both gossiper and gossipee - he co-writes a gossip column for the London Evening Standard magazine, but he is also the star of every other gossip column. PRs are paid millions to provide this kind of saturation exposure, but Nicky has no PR, he does it all on his ownio. And because he is so ubiquitous, companies shower him with freebies - an Accurist watch, a Skoda car, all the Evisu clothes he can wear - because, my dears, who else goes to as many A-list parties as Nicky Haslam? But now he is worried that people will think of him only as a party animal (how could this be?) when, of course, as all the world knows or should know, he is really a deeply serious interior designer. </p> <p>Until a couple of years ago he actually looked like an interior designer, I mean the rather queeny old stereotype. He had bouffant grey hair, and Savile Row suits and handmade shirts with cufflinks. But now he has re-invented himself as - well, what ? He says the initial aim was to look like Liam Gallagher, but now he thinks he looks like a bit of Brazilian rough trade. I'm not too familiar with Brazilian rough trade, but he certainly looks rough, street-cred grungy in his sleeveless denim jacket and baggy jeans, dripping with necklaces and beads, his face haphazardly daubed with make-up. More importantly, he looks young - he is 61 but could pass for 30 in a dim light. He seems to have mastered some sort of age-reversal process - if it goes on at this rate, he will spend his eighties in a babygro. </p> <p>Until two years ago he was ageing quite normally, but then 'I looked in the mirror one morning and realised I was growing into a blowsy, drunken old bag'. So he decided to change his look. 'I didn't want to look distinguished, I wanted to look fun, and also to fade into the street, into the King's Road. If I don't fade into a room at White's that's fine. My father was chairman of Brooks' and the Beefsteak, and I was brought up in that life, and it bores me rigid.' So he swapped the Gieves &amp; Hawkes for Evisu jeans, and exchanged his cufflinks for power bracelets. He dyed his hair jet black and also dyed his body hair. He says it's great fun to do - 'You go into the bath and come out looking like a gorilla!' Then last year he had a full facelift because he felt that 'Wattle on men is unforgivable.' </p> <p>So now he is happy or as happy as he can be with his look - he can never be blissed out because 'I've always wanted to look different. I always think I've got this terrible figure. I'd like to be 3in taller. I'd like not to have these great puffy lobes on my ears - I'd like them to taper in. I want ears like yours!' But apparently they can't be fixed because the surgeon told him 'Ears bleed for ever'. (One does learn some fascinating facts from Nicky Haslam, if facts they be.) But at least now he feels his image is more exciting, more fun . He no longer feels like Nicky Has-Been. </p> <p>The new Nicky got a massive unveiling at his 60th birthday party last year, as featured in OK! magazine. He invited 'just 300 of his closest friends', and the guest list was quite a testimony to his pulling power - not only the predictable Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, David Bailey, Ringo Starr, Anjelica Houston, Kate Moss, Jemima Khan, Jasper Conran but also Michael Heseltine, Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames and a very straight-looking septuagenarian who turned out to be his brother Michael. Elaine Paige sang Happy Birthday, everyone made sweet speeches and Nicky cried a lot. It was a very genuinely warm-hearted party by all accounts. </p> <p>People do really love Nicky Haslam - that fact was impressed on me very early on when several acquaintances rang to say warningly, 'I hear you're doing Nicky - you will be nice about him, won't you?' He inspires protectiveness - not that he is an innocent exactly, but he is so affectionate, so trusting, always rushing up to strangers wagging his tail, that his old friends always worry that his new friends will let him down. And he makes new best friends every week, possibly every day - recent acquisitions include Jay Kay of Jamiroquai, Donna Air of breakfast television, and Vanessa Feltz. </p> <p>Being Nicky's new best friend is an extraordinary, overwhelming experience - I had a brief taste of it while writing this article and it was truly wonderful, basking in his non-stop flattery. He managed to compliment me on my clothes every single time we met which, believe me, takes some doing. Once, when I was giving him a lift to a party, he even complimented me on my car - 'So smart!' he said, which is not the usual epithet for a filthy four-year-old Ford Mondeo. Best of all was his remark when we were going into a party - 'I'm afraid we won't know anyone here' - I loved that 'we'! </p> <p>Minn Hogg, the editor of The World of Interiors, who has known him since she was 16, has seen a million new best friends come and go. 'This is what he does: he picks you up, makes you feel a million dollars, says you'll be his best friend for ever and ever - but then somebody else comes along and you'll hear absolutely nothing for a while - or for ever. I learned that lesson very early and of course was very upset, but now we have a very solid friendship, it will never end now. But I mean, Vanessa Feltz - why ? Of course, he's the starfucker to end all starfuckers. He's a wonder - the Cecil Beaton of our age.' </p> <p>He lives on a diet of champagne, gin, sea breezes and party canap\u00e9s, though his food of choice is processed cheese sandwiches made with white, sliced Kingsmill bread - he likes the way his teeth leave little indentations in the bread. He never drinks wine, because it's bad for him, although champagne is good. 'I suppose I drink too much,' he says airily. 'But if I was going to be a drunk I'd be one by now.' He smokes 'about 44' Royals a day and snorts cocaine politely when the occasion demands. He tried his first E the other day and loved it, but he is not a great drug user. He is never ill because he believes in Lady Diana Cooper's maxim that being ill is 'common'. (Jet lag is common too, and so are tomatoes.) </p> <p>He is not a sex addict. He likes 'smooth girls and rough men', but is quite happy to admire them from afar. In fact, he says, he is so cautious sexually that he has never at any point been at risk from Aids - 'That part of sex doesn't appeal.' He has had three long love affairs in his life and was faithful to all three - the last one, with Paolo Moschino, a cousin of the fashion family, finished about two years ago, but they are still great friends as well as business partners. In fact, when I went to see Nicky in the country, Paolo was staying there with his new boyfriend, and they seemed to form a very happy threesome. </p> <p>Nicky says he is now happy to be unattached. 'Sometimes I think it would be nice to share everything I've got with somebody - and sometimes I think I'm very lucky to have the bathroom to myself. But I feel it would be nice to pass on my knowledge. Perhaps because I haven't got children - one wants to educate somebody.' </p> <p>Actually, his grandfather married and started a family at 77, so it wouldn't be inconceivable for Nicky to do the same - and what a talking point that would be! He comes from a very long-living, late-breeding family where the normal rules of age don't apply. His parents were literally Victorians - his father was 60 and his mother 43 when he was born. His mother was a Ponsonby, one of the old courtier families, and called Diamond because she was born during Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee - Queen Victoria was her godmother. She met Nicky's father William Haslam in Vienna, where he was working at the British embassy after the First World War, and fell madly in love, but he didn't want to get married, so she went off to America, married someone else and had a daughter. Then one day, according to Nicky, 'There was a knock on the door and my father said \"I've come to marry you.\"' So she left her American husband and married William. 'She did love him. It makes me cry really,' says Nicky, bursting into tears. </p> <p>The Haslams were 'trade' but very wealthy - they invented Aertex. (Unfortunately, Nicky didn't get any of the Haslam fortune, because his father left it to his two brothers - he felt Nicky would only spend it, which of course he would.) Nicky's father brought Diamond back to live in England, and they had two sons and then - after a long gap - Nicky. They lived in a 'perfect' William and Mary house called Great Hundridge Manor near Great Missenden, with an interior designed by Geoffrey Scott, who designed I Tatti for Bernard Berenson. Nicky remembers it as exquisitely beautiful, but unfortunately his parents split up when he was in his teens and sold it, and the house ended up with Arabs. Nicky and his brother thought of buying it back at one stage, but 'You can't really - it had bad memories as well as good ones.' </p> <p>The worst bad memory was that at seven he contracted polio and was in bed for three years - 'That's when I began to hate myself and feel out of place.' Before the illness he was a beautiful child; afterwards he was 'a fat blob'. For the first 18 months he was kept completely immobile, encased in plaster. He lost all contact with children his own age - 'What it meant was that I only knew grown-ups. I just remember my mother's friends in backless dresses, smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis and talking about the latest American musical. So when I finally went to school, aged 10, there were these horrible things called boys, who farted and picked their noses and played games and I didn't know what they were. And I was quite tubby because I hadn't been able to walk for three years, and I didn't know what a football was.' </p> <p>But while he was encased in plaster, his great love of decoration was born. His mother presented him with a huge dolls' house which fitted across his bed, and he spent his days rearranging the furniture and putting up new wallpaper. When he went to Eton he immediately decorated his rooms with ostrich feathers and leopardskin curtains. He was encouraged by the art master there, Wilfred Blunt, brother of the spy Sir Anthony Blunt, and met people like Oliver Messel and Cecil Beaton, 'all that extraordinary world of post-war faggotry' who in turn introduced him to Lady Diana Cooper, who became one of his dearest friends. </p> <p>After Eton, he worked for the photographer John French, where David Bailey also worked as an assistant. 'I adored David, we became the greatest mates in the world - I used to spend my life in the East End, wearing winklepicker shoes.' One day Bailey came round with Jean Shrimpton and said they were both leaving to work in America, and why didn't he come, too? So Nicky locked his house, left his car outside - and didn't return for 11 years. New York embraced him with open arms - Diana Vreeland called him Rembrandt and threw a party to celebrate his new suede suit; Tom Wolfe recorded seeing him at a party for the Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol put him in a film with Baby Jane Holzer. But then he fell in love with a man called Jimmy Davison, whose grandmother owned a large chunk of Arizona and went to live with him there. They bought a ranch (which had its own Hopi Indian reservation) and raised cattle - Nicky describes this as his cowboy period, when he looked like Robert Redford and wore 'these amazing beaded and embroidered suedes, chewed by squaws to make them soft.' </p> <p> After a brief stay in Los Angeles, he came back to England in 1972 to design a house for Lord Hesketh. This is where his career as an interior designer really began, and his client list since then has widened to include everyone from the Prince of Wales to Ringo Starr, Bryan Ferry, Rod Stewart (who he says has surprisingly good taste, especially in pictures), Rupert Everett, both the Saatchis. As a designer he describes himself simply as 'The Best. I've done rooms that I know should have a preservation order on them because they're so breathtaking and still will be in 100 years time.' </p> <p>But it is hard to define his style, because as he says, 'I have no style - the room has a style, the building has a style, the country has a style - not one of my jobs is the same.' Minn Hogg says this is true - with most designers she can recognise their style from a single photograph, but Nicky is so adaptable she might not even know it was him. 'He's not a one-note designer. It's a huge talent, he has immense knowledge about decoration. If he only did that, and didn't go to parties, he'd be unbelievably successful. But he can't not!' </p> <p>He has never advertised, ever - he gets all his clients by word of mouth and is able to pick and choose whom he takes on. I asked if there were any clients he would refuse to work for and he said 'Yes - north of the park.' Oh God. I felt my face freeze as our new best friendship crashed in smithereens. 'Nicky,' I said sorrowfully, 'I live north of the park.' 'Oh no, I mean quite far north - I mean Highgate.' 'That's exactly where I live.' 'Oh no, north of that - Winnington Road.' Oh dear.</p> <p>Winnington Road is about half a mile north of me, but it's academic - I fear he means Jewish. He says absolutely not, 'I'm not remotely anti-Jewish, I'd love to have Jewish blood, we should all have Jewish blood.' So what in heaven's name does he mean by north of the park? 'I mean new money, Russians and people like that - they're so impossible. They don't know what they want and they can't recognise a wonder when they're given it.' Arabs? 'Dodgy. And Indians dodgy. I'm used to a Christian culture, I like Christian symbols - I mean, with Arabs you can't have a head in the place and you're stuck with all that filigree muck.' </p> <p>After this unhappy conversation, I mentally put him down as anti-Semitic despite all his disclaimers, but a week later he asked me to a party at a house in Belgravia he had designed and the owners were obviously Jewish, and good friends. One of the guests was Gail Ronson, and I overheard her thanking him for the kind letter he sent when she had her troubles - she meant when her husband Gerald Ronson went to prison. The party was by way of being an unveiling of the new Nicky Haslam interior, but unfortunately the bedroom ceiling had fallen down - not his fault, but the result of flooding upstairs. </p> <p>Anyway, between all the hugs and hellos he took me on a guided tour and showed me the 15 shades of white he used for the drawing room, the waffle wallpaper he had specially painted for the dining room to match two Chinoiserie panels, the way he rearranged the doors to create an enfilade from one end of the flat to the other, the fabulous black marble bathroom and the even more fabulous lapis lazuli and gold bathroom. As he took me round, we were gradually joined by other guests and the women all started clamouring to see the master bedroom. Nicky was reluctant to show it because of the damaged ceiling, but eventually we all piled in and admired the four-poster bed and the exciting array of joists and wiring revealed by the hole in the ceiling. </p> <p>But the ladies were still dissatisfied - 'Where are her closets?' they clamoured - and Nicky pushed a secret door (the flat had seemingly dozens of secret doors - one that I pushed by mistake swung open to reveal a safe full of silver) and took us into the wardrobe. There was an Imelda Marcos wall of shoes and two enormous coat rails of clothes in black wardrobe bags. But while I was going 'Oo, aah, wottalotta shoes', the ladies all started sighing with disappointment. 'These can't be all her clothes, Nicky,' they mewed. 'Where are her furs?' Nicky said probably in New York and we left it at that, but later, in the car, he told me, 'There is a fur closet upstairs, but I didn't want to show them.' I think he was quite shocked by their nosiness. </p> <p>Nicky's own flat is very modest by comparison and in just about the nastiest location possible - the basement of a grim 50s block inches from the thundering traffic of the Cromwell Road. Inside, of course, it is gorgeous, rich dark glowing colours - chocolate, gold, silver, pearl - with classical busts and the famous four stools which, put together when he can remember the right order, make a Picasso abstract. The tables are densely piled with magazines - all featuring articles about Nicky Haslam, it turns out - and the place of honour on the sidetable goes to a photograph of Nicky with his hero Liam Gallagher at a Vogue party. </p> <p>The flat is dark but he hardly sees it in daylight because he works during the day at his office in Lower Sloane Street, and at weekends goes to his country house, an exquisite little Jacobean pavilion in Hampshire which he leases from the National Trust. The previous tenant was John Fowler, who founded Colefax &amp; Fowler, and Nicky has kept it in his style - lots of elastoplast-pink ragged paintwork, fake panelling, marble busts, carved pelmets over billowing curtains. The house feels more personal than his flat - a portrait of his mother hangs in the hall - and there are two framed letters in the drawing room complimenting him on his decor - one is from the Prince of Wales, the other from the late Nancy Lancaster, the doyenne of interior design - as if he needs that reassurance. </p> <p>Then there are his photograph albums and what a trove they are! They seem to commemorate every fabulous party of the last 40 years - a sumptuous world of luxury and leisure that is supposed to have vanished after the war. It hasn't vanished at all - it's still going on, wherever Nicky Haslam is. I told him he ought to publish them, and he admitted that he is now trying to write his autobiography. In fact, he's been supposed to be writing it for years but now he is really knuckling down - he is going to Mauritius over Christmas with his old friend Lee Radziwill - 'She's such a close friend she's practically my wife' - and intends to write every morning. But he is very alarmed by the whole exercise - 'I'm not trying to be disingenuous, but I never think I've got anything to say at all. I sort of think I'm the most terrible bore.' Oh I don't know, Nicky. I envy whoever is your new best friend.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Six-thirty and the party-partying begins. Nicky Haslam checks his pockets before leaving his flat. 'Keys, cash, kerchief, comb,' he recites. 'That's what nanny taught me. Cosmetics, cigarettes, cellular phone, coke and cards - that's my own addition.' Then off into the night, equipped with a stack of stiffies and an itinerary of sorts, because there are a lot of parties to get through, and Nicky has to 'look in' at them all before joining friends for dinner. He is sporting the scar on his cheek that will be his talking point for the evening. (My great mistake in life, I realise too late, is never having a talking point at parties.) Nicky's scar comes up to scratch - everywhere we go, women rush up crying, 'Darling Nicky! What happened to you?' And every time he says he's been in this terrible knife fight in Brixton, and every time the women are terribly upset and concerned and then he has to reassure them that it is only a stick-on scar as used in the movies. And all this talking about his talking point takes for ever so that parties simply flash by and you never have time to be bored even though you see the same people everywhere you go. But of course the talking point, the talking point that everyone else talks about is Nicky Haslam. He has achieved the apotheosis of fame whereby he is both gossiper and gossipee - he co-writes a gossip column for the London Evening Standard magazine, but he is also the star of every other gossip column. PRs are paid millions to provide this kind of saturation exposure, but Nicky has no PR, he does it all on his ownio. And because he is so ubiquitous, companies shower him with freebies - an Accurist watch, a Skoda car, all the Evisu clothes he can wear - because, my dears, who else goes to as many A-list parties as Nicky Haslam? But now he is worried that people will think of him only as a party animal (how could this be?) when, of course, as all the world knows or should know, he is really a deeply serious interior designer. Until a couple of years ago he actually looked like an interior designer, I mean the rather queeny old stereotype. He had bouffant grey hair, and Savile Row suits and handmade shirts with cufflinks. But now he has re-invented himself as - well, what ? He says the initial aim was to look like Liam Gallagher, but now he thinks he looks like a bit of Brazilian rough trade. I'm not too familiar with Brazilian rough trade, but he certainly looks rough, street-cred grungy in his sleeveless denim jacket and baggy jeans, dripping with necklaces and beads, his face haphazardly daubed with make-up. More importantly, he looks young - he is 61 but could pass for 30 in a dim light. He seems to have mastered some sort of age-reversal process - if it goes on at this rate, he will spend his eighties in a babygro. Until two years ago he was ageing quite normally, but then 'I looked in the mirror one morning and realised I was growing into a blowsy, drunken old bag'. So he decided to change his look. 'I didn't want to look distinguished, I wanted to look fun, and also to fade into the street, into the King's Road. If I don't fade into a room at White's that's fine. My father was chairman of Brooks' and the Beefsteak, and I was brought up in that life, and it bores me rigid.' So he swapped the Gieves &amp; Hawkes for Evisu jeans, and exchanged his cufflinks for power bracelets. He dyed his hair jet black and also dyed his body hair. He says it's great fun to do - 'You go into the bath and come out looking like a gorilla!' Then last year he had a full facelift because he felt that 'Wattle on men is unforgivable.' So now he is happy or as happy as he can be with his look - he can never be blissed out because 'I've always wanted to look different. I always think I've got this terrible figure. I'd like to be 3in taller. I'd like not to have these great puffy lobes on my ears - I'd like them to taper in. I want ears like yours!' But apparently they can't be fixed because the surgeon told him 'Ears bleed for ever'. (One does learn some fascinating facts from Nicky Haslam, if facts they be.) But at least now he feels his image is more exciting, more fun . He no longer feels like Nicky Has-Been. The new Nicky got a massive unveiling at his 60th birthday party last year, as featured in OK! magazine. He invited 'just 300 of his closest friends', and the guest list was quite a testimony to his pulling power - not only the predictable Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, David Bailey, Ringo Starr, Anjelica Houston, Kate Moss, Jemima Khan, Jasper Conran but also Michael Heseltine, Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames and a very straight-looking septuagenarian who turned out to be his brother Michael. Elaine Paige sang Happy Birthday, everyone made sweet speeches and Nicky cried a lot. It was a very genuinely warm-hearted party by all accounts. People do really love Nicky Haslam - that fact was impressed on me very early on when several acquaintances rang to say warningly, 'I hear you're doing Nicky - you will be nice about him, won't you?' He inspires protectiveness - not that he is an innocent exactly, but he is so affectionate, so trusting, always rushing up to strangers wagging his tail, that his old friends always worry that his new friends will let him down. And he makes new best friends every week, possibly every day - recent acquisitions include Jay Kay of Jamiroquai, Donna Air of breakfast television, and Vanessa Feltz. Being Nicky's new best friend is an extraordinary, overwhelming experience - I had a brief taste of it while writing this article and it was truly wonderful, basking in his non-stop flattery. He managed to compliment me on my clothes every single time we met which, believe me, takes some doing. Once, when I was giving him a lift to a party, he even complimented me on my car - 'So smart!' he said, which is not the usual epithet for a filthy four-year-old Ford Mondeo. Best of all was his remark when we were going into a party - 'I'm afraid we won't know anyone here' - I loved that 'we'! Minn Hogg, the editor of The World of Interiors, who has known him since she was 16, has seen a million new best friends come and go. 'This is what he does: he picks you up, makes you feel a million dollars, says you'll be his best friend for ever and ever - but then somebody else comes along and you'll hear absolutely nothing for a while - or for ever. I learned that lesson very early and of course was very upset, but now we have a very solid friendship, it will never end now. But I mean, Vanessa Feltz - why ? Of course, he's the starfucker to end all starfuckers. He's a wonder - the Cecil Beaton of our age.' He lives on a diet of champagne, gin, sea breezes and party canap\u00e9s, though his food of choice is processed cheese sandwiches made with white, sliced Kingsmill bread - he likes the way his teeth leave little indentations in the bread. He never drinks wine, because it's bad for him, although champagne is good. 'I suppose I drink too much,' he says airily. 'But if I was going to be a drunk I'd be one by now.' He smokes 'about 44' Royals a day and snorts cocaine politely when the occasion demands. He tried his first E the other day and loved it, but he is not a great drug user. He is never ill because he believes in Lady Diana Cooper's maxim that being ill is 'common'. (Jet lag is common too, and so are tomatoes.) He is not a sex addict. He likes 'smooth girls and rough men', but is quite happy to admire them from afar. In fact, he says, he is so cautious sexually that he has never at any point been at risk from Aids - 'That part of sex doesn't appeal.' He has had three long love affairs in his life and was faithful to all three - the last one, with Paolo Moschino, a cousin of the fashion family, finished about two years ago, but they are still great friends as well as business partners. In fact, when I went to see Nicky in the country, Paolo was staying there with his new boyfriend, and they seemed to form a very happy threesome. Nicky says he is now happy to be unattached. 'Sometimes I think it would be nice to share everything I've got with somebody - and sometimes I think I'm very lucky to have the bathroom to myself. But I feel it would be nice to pass on my knowledge. Perhaps because I haven't got children - one wants to educate somebody.' Actually, his grandfather married and started a family at 77, so it wouldn't be inconceivable for Nicky to do the same - and what a talking point that would be! He comes from a very long-living, late-breeding family where the normal rules of age don't apply. His parents were literally Victorians - his father was 60 and his mother 43 when he was born. His mother was a Ponsonby, one of the old courtier families, and called Diamond because she was born during Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee - Queen Victoria was her godmother. She met Nicky's father William Haslam in Vienna, where he was working at the British embassy after the First World War, and fell madly in love, but he didn't want to get married, so she went off to America, married someone else and had a daughter. Then one day, according to Nicky, 'There was a knock on the door and my father said \"I've come to marry you.\"' So she left her American husband and married William. 'She did love him. It makes me cry really,' says Nicky, bursting into tears. The Haslams were 'trade' but very wealthy - they invented Aertex. (Unfortunately, Nicky didn't get any of the Haslam fortune, because his father left it to his two brothers - he felt Nicky would only spend it, which of course he would.) Nicky's father brought Diamond back to live in England, and they had two sons and then - after a long gap - Nicky. They lived in a 'perfect' William and Mary house called Great Hundridge Manor near Great Missenden, with an interior designed by Geoffrey Scott, who designed I Tatti for Bernard Berenson. Nicky remembers it as exquisitely beautiful, but unfortunately his parents split up when he was in his teens and sold it, and the house ended up with Arabs. Nicky and his brother thought of buying it back at one stage, but 'You can't really - it had bad memories as well as good ones.' The worst bad memory was that at seven he contracted polio and was in bed for three years - 'That's when I began to hate myself and feel out of place.' Before the illness he was a beautiful child; afterwards he was 'a fat blob'. For the first 18 months he was kept completely immobile, encased in plaster. He lost all contact with children his own age - 'What it meant was that I only knew grown-ups. I just remember my mother's friends in backless dresses, smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis and talking about the latest American musical. So when I finally went to school, aged 10, there were these horrible things called boys, who farted and picked their noses and played games and I didn't know what they were. And I was quite tubby because I hadn't been able to walk for three years, and I didn't know what a football was.' But while he was encased in plaster, his great love of decoration was born. His mother presented him with a huge dolls' house which fitted across his bed, and he spent his days rearranging the furniture and putting up new wallpaper. When he went to Eton he immediately decorated his rooms with ostrich feathers and leopardskin curtains. He was encouraged by the art master there, Wilfred Blunt, brother of the spy Sir Anthony Blunt, and met people like Oliver Messel and Cecil Beaton, 'all that extraordinary world of post-war faggotry' who in turn introduced him to Lady Diana Cooper, who became one of his dearest friends. After Eton, he worked for the photographer John French, where David Bailey also worked as an assistant. 'I adored David, we became the greatest mates in the world - I used to spend my life in the East End, wearing winklepicker shoes.' One day Bailey came round with Jean Shrimpton and said they were both leaving to work in America, and why didn't he come, too? So Nicky locked his house, left his car outside - and didn't return for 11 years. New York embraced him with open arms - Diana Vreeland called him Rembrandt and threw a party to celebrate his new suede suit; Tom Wolfe recorded seeing him at a party for the Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol put him in a film with Baby Jane Holzer. But then he fell in love with a man called Jimmy Davison, whose grandmother owned a large chunk of Arizona and went to live with him there. They bought a ranch (which had its own Hopi Indian reservation) and raised cattle - Nicky describes this as his cowboy period, when he looked like Robert Redford and wore 'these amazing beaded and embroidered suedes, chewed by squaws to make them soft.' After a brief stay in Los Angeles, he came back to England in 1972 to design a house for Lord Hesketh. This is where his career as an interior designer really began, and his client list since then has widened to include everyone from the Prince of Wales to Ringo Starr, Bryan Ferry, Rod Stewart (who he says has surprisingly good taste, especially in pictures), Rupert Everett, both the Saatchis. As a designer he describes himself simply as 'The Best. I've done rooms that I know should have a preservation order on them because they're so breathtaking and still will be in 100 years time.' But it is hard to define his style, because as he says, 'I have no style - the room has a style, the building has a style, the country has a style - not one of my jobs is the same.' Minn Hogg says this is true - with most designers she can recognise their style from a single photograph, but Nicky is so adaptable she might not even know it was him. 'He's not a one-note designer. It's a huge talent, he has immense knowledge about decoration. If he only did that, and didn't go to parties, he'd be unbelievably successful. But he can't not!' He has never advertised, ever - he gets all his clients by word of mouth and is able to pick and choose whom he takes on. I asked if there were any clients he would refuse to work for and he said 'Yes - north of the park.' Oh God. I felt my face freeze as our new best friendship crashed in smithereens. 'Nicky,' I said sorrowfully, 'I live north of the park.' 'Oh no, I mean quite far north - I mean Highgate.' 'That's exactly where I live.' 'Oh no, north of that - Winnington Road.' Oh dear. Winnington Road is about half a mile north of me, but it's academic - I fear he means Jewish. He says absolutely not, 'I'm not remotely anti-Jewish, I'd love to have Jewish blood, we should all have Jewish blood.' So what in heaven's name does he mean by north of the park? 'I mean new money, Russians and people like that - they're so impossible. They don't know what they want and they can't recognise a wonder when they're given it.' Arabs? 'Dodgy. And Indians dodgy. I'm used to a Christian culture, I like Christian symbols - I mean, with Arabs you can't have a head in the place and you're stuck with all that filigree muck.' After this unhappy conversation, I mentally put him down as anti-Semitic despite all his disclaimers, but a week later he asked me to a party at a house in Belgravia he had designed and the owners were obviously Jewish, and good friends. One of the guests was Gail Ronson, and I overheard her thanking him for the kind letter he sent when she had her troubles - she meant when her husband Gerald Ronson went to prison. The party was by way of being an unveiling of the new Nicky Haslam interior, but unfortunately the bedroom ceiling had fallen down - not his fault, but the result of flooding upstairs. Anyway, between all the hugs and hellos he took me on a guided tour and showed me the 15 shades of white he used for the drawing room, the waffle wallpaper he had specially painted for the dining room to match two Chinoiserie panels, the way he rearranged the doors to create an enfilade from one end of the flat to the other, the fabulous black marble bathroom and the even more fabulous lapis lazuli and gold bathroom. As he took me round, we were gradually joined by other guests and the women all started clamouring to see the master bedroom.

Inside, of course, it is gorgeous, rich dark glowing colours - chocolate, gold, silver, pearl - with classical busts and the famous four stools which, put together when he can remember the right order, make a Picasso abstract. The tables are densely piled with magazines - all featuring articles about Nicky Haslam, it turns out - and the place of honour on the sidetable goes to a photograph of Nicky with his hero Liam Gallagher at a Vogue party. The flat is dark but he hardly sees it in daylight because he works during the day at his office in Lower Sloane Street, and at weekends goes to his country house, an exquisite little Jacobean pavilion in Hampshire which he leases from the National Trust.

The house feels more personal than his flat - a portrait of his mother hangs in the hall - and there are two framed letters in the drawing room complimenting him on his decor - one is from the Prince of Wales, the other from the late Nancy Lancaster, the doyenne of interior design - as if he needs that reassurance. Then there are his photograph albums and what a trove they are! They seem to commemorate every fabulous party of the last 40 years - a sumptuous world of luxury and leisure that is supposed to have vanished after the war. It hasn't vanished at all - it's still going on, wherever Nicky Haslam is. I told him he ought to publish them, and he admitted that he is now trying to write his autobiography. In fact, he's been supposed to be writing it for years but now he is really knuckling down - he is going to Mauritius over Christmas with his old friend Lee Radziwill - 'She's such a close friend she's practically my wife' - and intends to write every morning. But he is very alarmed by the whole exercise - 'I'm not trying to be disingenuous, but I never think I've got anything to say at all. I sort of think I'm the most terrible bore.' Oh I don't know, Nicky. I envy whoever is your new best friend.",

The film offered some perverse equations of sex and death, but for Conrad the induction into adult mysteries required some preliminary transgressions on his part. Not only did he have to infringe regulations by sneaking into a film whose certificate excluded 13-year-olds, but since there were no weekend matin\u00e9es he also played truant from school. For him, there was nothing passive about sitting in the dark, at the mercy of a dark imagination. It was the climax of a crash course of initiations into disobedience and moral danger. </p> <p>In the four decades since then, Conrad has certainly done his homework on Hitchcock. Not only has he watched the films again and again, alert to such details as a travel poster in North By Northwest emblazoned with the title phrase, or the word spelled out in neon (never seen in full) in Rope - he deduces it as STORAGE, ironically appropriate for a film in which a corpse is concealed in a chest for most of the running time. He has also read the books on which the screenplays were (often loosely) based. This leads to some critical sleight of hand, enabling him to reintroduce, as subtext, material that the films left out. </p> <p>But then Conrad is the critic as magician, at least as tricky as the film director he so much admires. He rejects a chronological approach as plodding, and prefers to come at Hitchcock's work from all angles at once, darting freely between films widely separated in time. He defends this liberty on the basis that these many films form a unity rather than an evolution - 'I do not believe that his concerns or his tactics changed significantly in a career that lasted half a century.' Temperamentally, too, he has a preference for intellectual omnipresence. This approach makes possible some fascinating discussions, such as an anatomy of the composite Hitchcock house, mined with unease from chimney (The Birds) to cellar (Psycho). The claim of unity is still a strong one, since similar elements in his films have a very different resonance at different stages in his career. </p> <p>He twice broke the suspense-film taboo against killing off sympathetic characters. In Sabotage (1936), he set up a sequence against the clock (the timer of a bomb, in fact), at the end of which a boy innocently carrying a deadly package was blown up by it. This scene prepares the ground for one of the most emotionally truthful moments in his films, in which the boy's sister (played by Sylvia Sidney), bereaved and in shock, wanders into the East End cinema she runs, and finds herself laughing mechanically at a Disney version of Who Killed Cock Robin? The killing of the boy was not popular with the public, and Hitchcock claimed to repent of exceeding its tolerance. By the time he killed off Marion Crane in Psycho, it wasn't an experiment with an audience, catching the deeper emotions by surprise, but a black joke at the viewer's expense. Conrad aligns Hitchcock, as a liberator of the irrational, with Andr\u00e9 Breton's political and philosophical sur realism as much as with the more mischievous and opportunistic brand practised by Salvador Dali, Hitchcock's collaborator (on Spellbound). Breton's programme of 'total revolt, complete insubordination, sabotage according to rule' doesn't seem to fit with Conrad's recurring adjective 'cheeky', which suggests the breaking of rules without overturning them. </p> <p>Later, Conrad modifies his portrait of Hitchcock from revolutionary to setter of limits: 'Inside the darkened room, we are shown what we are capable of... the spectacle, in most cases, scares us into behaving as society ordains... the psychological revolt is contained.' </p> <p>These two rather different Hitchcocks are awkwardly accommodated in the book's concluding paragraph: 'He encouraged insurgent fantasy, but warned us against expecting our wishes to be fulfilled in the daylight world outside the cinema.' But then a conclusion is a rather prosaic thing, and Conrad's style of criticism is continuously dazzling rather than incremental. </p> <p>It becomes clear from a discussion of editing, where the individual sentences aren't necessarily more eloquent in themselves than shots in a storyboarded sequence ('Scissors can cut film, but are also liable to carve up human bodies') that Conrad's own procedure is actually a sort of montage of ideas and aper\u00e7us, rather than a conventionally mounted argument. His three section titles ('The Art of Murder', 'The Technique of Murder', 'The Religion of Murder') may announce a deepening investigation but the subsections tend to break off, with no feeling of cadence. Tireless as a rule at delving beneath appearances, Conrad takes rather at face value Hitchcock's account of being locked up for a childhood misdemeanour. 'Arrest' becomes 'his abiding trauma', and a word that 'haunted the quaking Hitchcock, who could never forget his childhood sojourn in a cell at the police station, where his parents allegedly sent him as punishment for naughtiness'. That sceptical word 'allegedly' is neutralised by appearing so late in the sentence. </p> <p>Traumas are not normally publicised by those who suffer them, but perhaps Conrad is striking a bargain here. If he leaves Hitchcock's claims unchallenged, his own rather Gothic self-portrait may escape being seen as a literary or structural device. The boy whose imagination was both awoken and imprisoned by Psycho has, by the end of the book, become a sort of Norman Bates in his own right, living in a house decorated with polyglot posters for his hero's movies, and dreaming of 'a larger, lonelier house, preferably on a hill.'

      "body": "<p><strong>Lucy Moore</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> The Journals of Sylvia Plath </strong> edited by <strong> Karen V. Kukil</strong> (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. </p> <p><strong>Lewis Wolpert</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist</strong> (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. <strong> Hitler's Gift</strong>, by<strong> Jean Medawar and David Pyke</strong> (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. </p> <p><strong>Simon Jenkins</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> White Teeth</strong> (Random House) by <strong> Zadie Smith </strong> is funny and sad. <strong> Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats <strong> Andrew Rawnsley's </strong> gossipy <strong> Servants of the People </strong> (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for <strong> Gladwyn Turbutt's </strong> four-volume <strong> History of Derbyshire</strong> (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. </p> <p><strong>Barbara Trapido</strong><br></p> <p> While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was <strong> G\u00fcnther Grass's </strong> time travelling, massively long <strong> Too Far Afield </strong> (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, <strong> Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club </strong> (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with <strong> Romesh Gunesekera's </strong> beautiful exile story, <strong> The Sandglass </strong> (Granta). </p> <p><strong>Robert Harris</strong><br> </p> <p> The latest selection from <strong> Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics </strong> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. </p> <p> <strong> Graham Robb's Rimbaud</strong> (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. <strong> Penelope Fitzgerald</strong>, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, <strong> The Means of Escape </strong> (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. </p> <p><strong>Joan Bakewell</strong><br>L </p> <p> <strong> J. G. Ballard </strong> has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now <strong> Super-Cannes </strong> (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, <strong> Richard Holmes</strong> is always interesting. <strong> Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer</strong> (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. <strong> Experience</strong> by <strong> Martin Amis </strong> (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. </p> <p><strong> Zadie Smith</strong><br> </p> <p> I choose <strong> Martin Amis's </strong> memoir <strong> Experience</strong> (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, <strong> Edward Platt's </strong> intimate biography of the A40, <strong> Leadville </strong> (Picador), for the same reason, and <strong> Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</strong> (Picador) because it kicks ass. </p> <p><strong>Misha Glenny</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History </strong> (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. <strong> Night of Stone </strong> (Granta) , <strong> Catherine Merridale's </strong> account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. <strong> Kosovo: War and Revenge</strong> (Yale), <strong> Tim Judah's </strong> reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. </p> <p><strong>Nicci Gerard</strong><br> </p> <p> In <strong> The Human Stain </strong> (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - <strong> Philip Roth </strong> manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, <strong> Philip Pullman</strong> published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, <strong> The Amber Spyglass </strong> (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Frayling</strong><br></p> <p> I particularly enjoyed <strong> David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture</strong> (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was <strong> Thomas McGuane's</strong> elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as <strong> Some Horses </strong> (The Lyons Press). </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Meades</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Atomised</strong> by <strong> Michel Houllebecq </strong> (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In<strong> The Third Reich: A New History </strong> (Macmillan), <strong> Michael Burleigh</strong> proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. </p> <p><strong>Brenda Maddox</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan </strong> (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous <strong> Letters of Kingsley Amis</strong> edited by <strong> Zachary Leader </strong> (HarperCollins). </p> <p> <strong>Antony Holden</strong><br> </p> <p> Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. <strong> Martin Amis's</strong> memoir <strong> Experience</strong> (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired <strong> Miranda Seymour's</strong> exhaustive biography of <strong> Mary Shelley. </strong> </p> <p><strong>Charles Saumarez Smith</strong><br></p> <p> My favourite book of the year is called <strong> City Secrets: Rome</strong> (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect <strong> Robert Kahn</strong>, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed <strong> The Long Afternoon </strong> (Sceptre), <strong> Giles Waterfield's</strong> dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. </p> <p><strong>Jan Morris</strong><br> </p> <p> In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed <strong> Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also <strong> Peter Ackroyd's </strong> virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, <strong> London: The Biography</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by <strong> Miles Bredin's</strong> life of James Bruce, <strong> The Pale Abyssinian</strong> (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. </p> <p><strong>Mary Riddell</strong><br> </p> <p> As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed <strong> Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters </strong> (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. </p> <p> <strong>Tom Paulin</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies</strong> (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). <strong> Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. </p> <p><strong>Edna O'Brien</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Snow and Guilt </strong> by <strong> Giorgio Pressburger </strong> (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for <strong> The Journals of Sylvia Plath</strong> (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. <strong> Eilis Ni Dhuibhne</strong> is the most gifted young Irish writer. In <strong> The Pale Gold of Alaska</strong> (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. </p> <p><strong>George Steiner</strong><br> </p> <p> My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is <strong> Colin Thubron's In Siberia </strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. </p> <p><strong>Gita Sereny</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna</strong> is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. <strong> Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding </strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with <strong> Ian Kershaw's</strong> two volumes of Hitler biography - <strong> Hubris</strong> and <strong> Nemesis </strong> (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved <strong> Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin</strong> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). <strong> George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain</strong> (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved <strong> Kent Haruf 's Plainsong</strong> and <strong> Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love</strong> (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read <strong> Robert Harris's Archangel </strong> (Arrow), <strong> Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement </strong> (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by <strong> Michael Connelly</strong> (Orion). </p> <p><strong>Mavis Cheek</strong><br> </p> <p> 'Not for horrid profs,' says <strong> Frank Kermode </strong> of his <strong> Shakespeare's Language</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called <strong> Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship</strong> (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With <strong> The World's Smallest Unicorn</strong> (Cape),<strong> Shena Mackay </strong> brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. </p> <p><strong> A L Kennedy</strong><br> </p> <p> This year <strong> No Great Mischief</strong> (Cape) made <strong> Alasdair MacLeod's </strong> position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. </p> <p><strong>Terry Eagleton</strong><br> </p> <p> Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time. To write the very best book on him to date is thus a remarkable achievement. <strong> Ken Hirschkop's Mikhail Bakhtin: An Aesthetic for Democracy</strong> (OUP) combines dogged work in the Russian archives with some brilliant insights to show Bakhtin's relevance to questions of politics and popular democracy today. </p> <p><strong>Glen Baxter</strong><br> </p> <p> My contenders for book of the year would have to include <strong> Flick Knives and Forks</strong> (Zillah Bell Contemporary Art) by <strong> Anthony Earnshaw</strong> - a collection of the great English surrealists' aphorisms spiced with black humour. My next choice would be <strong> The Book of Leviathan</strong> (Sort of Books) by <strong> Peter Bleguad</strong> which is funny, enigmatic and beautifully limned - what more could one ask? </p> <p><strong>Hermione Lee</strong> </p> <p> My book of the year is the <strong> Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai</strong> (Faber) edited by his friend <strong> Ted Hughes</strong> and by <strong> Daniel Weissbort. </strong> His wry, conversational poems - tender, humane and pragmatic - on war, love, memory, and the fierce history of his city, Jerusalem, are all the more moving now. I was also delighted by the dazzling stories of <strong> Peter Ho Davies, Equal Love </strong> (Granta) , and by <strong> Mich\u00e8le Roberts's </strong> deliciously sensual French novel, <strong> The Looking Glass</strong> (Virago). </p> <p> <strong>Helen Dunmore</strong><br> </p> <p> It's seven years since <strong> Michael Donaghy</strong> last published a poetry collection. Here, after a magical interval, is <strong> Conjure</strong> (Picador), his best book yet. Conjure takes all the Donaghy virtues - wit, clarity, breathtaking control of rhyme and rhythm - and adds a new intensity of feeling. </p> <p><strong>David Hare</strong><br> </p> <p> Why do women write about the recent past so much better than men? Only John Osborne has described the day before yesterday as skilfully as Barbara Skelton, Doris Lessing and Joan Wyndham. <strong> Stet</strong> (Granta), is a record of <strong> Diana Athill's</strong> years as an editor at Andre Deutsch. It's hard to believe that most of her authors came anywhere near Athill's own superb literary pitch. Over the internet you can order the American edition of <strong> The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Volume 1 1920-1945</strong> (New Directions) - essential reading for admirers of one of America's greatest dramatists </p> <p> <strong>Emma Tennant</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Lorna Sage's Bad Blood </strong> (Fourth Estate) is a deceptively simple account of a Second World War childhood in deepest Flintshire, which makes sense of the enormous and bewildering changes in society in the last century. </p> <p> <strong>Michael Foot</strong><br></p> <p> Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that <strong> Rebecca West</strong> was not one of the great women of the century. Her <strong> Selected Letters</strong>, edited by <strong> Bonnie Kime Scott</strong> (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions. She would have appreciated the latest of essays from her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, <strong> Merlin Holland's The Oscar Wilde Anthology</strong> (HarperCollins). And don't miss <strong> Have You Forgotten Yet? The First World War Memoirs of C P Blacker</strong>, edited by <strong> John Blacker</strong> (Pen and Sword Books ), an original, plain-spoken record of the First World War which confronts the reader fairly with the Siegfried Sassoon verdict on the whole affair. </p> <p><strong>Adam Phillips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> R. F. Langley's Collected Poems</strong> (Carcanet) has a new music of sense-making about it that is, in the way only poetry and music can be, like an illumination. <strong> Larry Siedentop's Democracy In Europe</strong> (Allen Lane, Penguin) has a remarkable clarity and exhilaration about something that runs the risk of becoming just another topic of debate. <strong> Richard Lewontin</strong> with <strong> The Triple Helix </strong> (Harvard) continues to be the scientist everyone should read. </p> <p><strong>J G Ballard</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> In The Heart Of The Sea </strong> by Nathaniel Philbrick (HarperCollins) is a deeply moving account of the sinking of the whale ship Essex , which inspired Melville's Moby Dick. Rammed by a sperm whale, the Essex sank three days later, and the survivors set out by boat for the South American coast, 4,000 miles away. Nathaniel Philbrick unsparingly describes their ordeal, a hellish descent into starvation and cannibalism. None the less, these desperate men emerge as heroes. </p> <p><strong>Philip French</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> George Orwell</strong> is possibly the greatest writer of the twentieth century and next year's major publishing event will be the paperback editions at affordable prices of the first three volumes of his complete essays, letters and diaries: <strong> All Propaganda is Lies 1941-42</strong>, <strong> Keeping Our Little Corner Clean</strong> and <strong> Two Wasted Years 1943</strong> (Secker &amp; Warburg). My three new favourites all address themselves to settling the business of the last century. <strong> Douglas Dunn's </strong> vivid book-length poem <strong> The Donkey's Ears</strong> (Faber), purports to be the letters home to his wife by the self-questioning flag engineer of the Russian fleet steaming from the Baltic to the East China Sea to be destroyed by the Japanese in May 1905. </p> <p> <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) magnificently completes the informal trilogy about post-war America that Roth began with American Pastoral and I Married a Communist. My film choice is Christopher Frayling's <strong> Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death </strong> (Faber), a fascinating biography that locates a great director in the complex social and cultural context of twentieth-century Italy. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Motion</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Derek Mahon</strong> has always been a busy reviser and re-presenter of his own work. His latest <strong> Selected Poems</strong> (Penguin) is his best shot yet at self-definition - a wonderfully varied, skilful and abundant book by a writer who is working at his formidable best. Wordsworth was a grand old tinkerer, too, and watching him chop and change is just one of the fascinations of <strong> Juliet Barker's </strong> enormous, and enormously sympathetic, biography <strong> Wordsworth: A Life</strong> (Viking). And yet another revision: the third edition of <strong> Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan</strong> (Cassell) - the best book there is on Dylan, now better than ever. </p> <p><strong>Peter Conrad</strong><br></p> <p> Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by <strong> Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40</strong> (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. </p> <p><strong>Chris Patten</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> Philip Roth's The Human Stain</strong> (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the <strong> Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers</strong> (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. </p> <p> <strong>Cressida Connolly</strong><br> </p> <p> The American <strong> Rick Moody</strong> is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, <strong> Demonology</strong> (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed <strong> Kazuo Ishiguro's </strong> extraordinary novel, <strong> When We Were Orphans </strong> (Faber). My best book of the year was <strong> Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I </strong> (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And <strong> John Burnside </strong> 's new poems, the <strong> Asylum Dance</strong> (Cape), are pretty good, too. </p> <p><strong>Steven Berkoff</strong><br> </p> <p> In characteristic style <strong> Peter Ackroyd </strong> pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in <strong> London: The Biography</strong> (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. </p> <p> <strong> A Positively Final Appearance </strong> (Penguin) affords another view of London. <strong> Alec Guinness </strong> 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice. A man of consummate taste and culture, he epitomises England, an England unfamiliar to us now but which still surrounds Guinness like a bubble. His reading is Trollope and Anthony Powell, while for comfort he quotes from Montaigne, but all so unpretentiously. This is an actor's actor, a man of culture, breeding and even a defined morality. </p> <p><strong>Martin Amis</strong><br> </p> <p> Fiction: <strong> Saul Bellow's Ravelstein </strong> (Penguin).

      "bodyText": "Lucy Moore The Journals of Sylvia Plath edited by Karen V. Kukil (Faber) make uncomfortable reading because she is so searingly, desperately intense - but that is also what makes them so compelling. A fascinating look into a brilliant, tortured mind. Lewis Wolpert James Lovelock's Homage to Gaia - The Life of an Independent Scientist (OUP) is not so much a homage to his captivating idea but rather a homage to science and his own life in it. There is no autobiography of a scientist to compete with this one. Hitler's Gift, by Jean Medawar and David Pyke (Metro), tells the stories of 21 brilliant scientists who took refuge in Britain shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 and Jews were dismissed from their university posts. A moving story and a moral tale. Simon Jenkins White Teeth (Random House) by Zadie Smith is funny and sad. Larry Siedentop's Democracy in Europe (Allen Lane, Penguin) was the most original political book of the year. For politics of a lighter hue, nothing beats Andrew Rawnsley's gossipy Servants of the People (Hamish Hamilton), presenting New Labour as a court that Machiavelli would recognise and from which Blairism will never quite recover. And let us hear a cheer for Gladwyn Turbutt's four-volume History of Derbyshire (Merton Priory). This masterpiece of local history, 10 years in the making, is proof that such invaluable books can still see the light of day, defying the outpourings of technology. Barbara Trapido While I have tried to make this a writing rather than a reading year, there were two books I couldn't not read. One was G\u00fcnther Grass's time travelling, massively long Too Far Afield (Faber), in which the 'footnote slaves' of a GDR archive tell the story of an aged file courier whose life is rescued by an obsession with a literary Huguenot. The other, Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club (Viking), not out until next March but read in a sneak preview, is a boys' school story set in 1970s Birmingham. Coe can present social history without sacrificing characters to events and both here are a joy. I also caught up, in paperback, with Romesh Gunesekera's beautiful exile story, The Sandglass (Granta). Robert Harris The latest selection from Alan Clark's Diaries, Into Politics (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) still offers, for my money, the strongest narrative voice of the year - an elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy, all of which are transfigured by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty. Graham Robb's Rimbaud (Picador) demythologises the subject while leaving quite intact the magic of the art. Penelope Fitzgerald, who died in April, left us a farewell present of short stories, The Means of Escape (Flamingo): economical enigmas which remind us to reread her last four great novels. Joan Bakewell L J. G. Ballard has always been astonishingly prophetic in his visions. Now Super-Cannes (Flamingo) imagines the dangers, plausible and horrifying, of the culture of global corporations. Even when not on major biographical duty, Richard Holmes is always interesting. Sidetracks - Explorations of a Romantic Biographer (HarperCollins) are minor excursions down biographical byways but offer up insights I couldn't have anticipated. Experience by Martin Amis (Jonathan Cape) is brilliant for its cun ning structure and density of impressions. Zadie Smith I choose Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) because it's exquisitely written, Edward Platt's intimate biography of the A40, Leadville (Picador), for the same reason, and Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador) because it kicks ass. Misha Glenny Michael Burleigh's The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan) is how history should be written. Illuminating and stylish, it offers insights for the general reader and scholar alike without boring either. Night of Stone (Granta) , Catherine Merridale's account of how ordinary Russians coped with violent death on a scale few of us can even imagine, is an epic and moving his tory. Kosovo: War and Revenge (Yale), Tim Judah's reconstruction of the war in Kosovo and the dynamics of Serb and Albanian politics in the territory, is clear and instructive. Nicci Gerard In The Human Stain (Cape) - a stunning, complex novel of snarling rage, passion, sarcasm, scorching humour and extraordinary beauty - Philip Roth manages to weave together public history and private lives and seems to pack 10 novels into this dense one. In October, Philip Pullman published the final in his dazzling Dark Materials trilogy, The Amber Spyglass (David Fickling Books). He understands the power of a good story, but he is an uncosy, often scary and troubling novelist: besotted by myth, compelled by death and desire and faith and grief, in love with Milton and Blake, angry with religion, intimate with compromise and complicity and corruption, capable of radiant prose. Christopher Frayling I particularly enjoyed David Skal's Screams of Reason - Mad Science and Modern Culture (W. W. Norton &amp; Co) which begins with Dr Faustus and ends with Stephen Hawking but concentrates in between on Boris Karloff and Hollywood horror. The best-written book I read was Thomas McGuane's elegant and thoughtful essays about the partnership - a partnership he calls 'a burst of poetry' - between humans and horses collected as Some Horses (The Lyons Press). Jonathan Meades Atomised by Michel Houllebecq (Heinemann) is the most thrilling novel I've read in several years. Its directness, its energy, its centripetal concentration, its candour, its nihilism and its sod-you-ism are exhilarating. In The Third Reich: A New History (Macmillan), Michael Burleigh proceeds from the premise that Nazism was a quasi-religion whose programme allowed the faithful to perpetrate enormities with a clear conscience. His book is a massive accretion of detail and appalling anecdote. Brenda Maddox Andrew Roberts's Salisbury: Victorian Titan (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) is as learned, accessible and well-shaped a biography as I've read. Roberts is a rare historian, with an eye for the human detail and for contemporary relevance. I also loved the outrageous Letters of Kingsley Amis edited by Zachary Leader (HarperCollins). Antony Holden Angry, outrageous, wildly funny and infinitely sad, Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) completes the majestic postwar US trilogy which began in equally high style with American Pastoral. Martin Amis's memoir Experience (Jonathan Cape) is up there with Roth's The Facts; when fine fictional stylists turn their laser-prose upon themselves, the result is an auto-brainscan offering a tantalising glimpse towards the heart. I also much admired Miranda Seymour's exhaustive biography of Mary Shelley. Charles Saumarez Smith My favourite book of the year is called City Secrets: Rome (The Little Bookroom). Edited by the architect Robert Kahn, it consists of recommendations of what to see and do in Rome as sent in by the American Academy of Rome's many supporters. It's a brilliant idea. I also enjoyed The Long Afternoon (Sceptre), Giles Waterfield's dry and atmospheric novel about his grandparents' life in Menton between the wars. Jan Morris In non-fiction I greatly admired and enjoyed Simon Schama's Rembrandt's Eyes (Allen Lane, Penguin), which was published in the autumn of 1999 but did not reach me until the present millennium; also Peter Ackroyd's virtuoso evocation of the most timeless of cities, London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus). I was delighted by Miles Bredin's life of James Bruce, The Pale Abyssinian (HarperCollins), but since Mr Bredin is my godson I'd better not say anything too nice about it. Mary Riddell As lucid as anything he has written and, in the paperback edition, particularly well-timed Matt Ridley's Genome - the Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters (Fourth Estate) is the A to Z route map for anyone trying to get to grips with the completion of the Human Genome Project. Tom Paulin Martin Allen's Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies (Macmillan) paints a devastating picture of this truly evil royal who was a close friend of Charles Bedaux, a Nazi spy so dangerous that the FBI would appear to have bumped him off in 1944 (officially he committed suicide). Frank Kermode's Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an inspiring work of evaluative critical analysis. Edna O'Brien Snow and Guilt by Giorgio Pressburger (Granta) is a perfect little book. Translated by Shaun Whiteside, these six stories have an underlying unity; the writing is austere yet with a life-affirming tenderness. The same cannot be said for The Journals of Sylvia Plath (Faber). Here we witness the rage, the torment and the competitiveness of a deeply wounded young woman. As I began to read them I wondered if all journals ought not to be consigned to the pyre, but by the time I had finished I marvelled at her industriousness and her capacity at transforming her demons into great art. Eilis Ni Dhuibhne is the most gifted young Irish writer. In The Pale Gold of Alaska (Blackstaff Press), her prose shimmers like poetry. George Steiner My book of the year (if a delayed finding in paperback is allowed), is Colin Thubron's In Siberia (Chatto &amp; Windus) . There is hardly a sentence in this grim yet strangely luminous memoir without a taut vivacity which makes the whole book 'sing'. Thubron's account of the abandoned Stalinist death-camps in the Siberian Kolyma, of the pounding into ice and mud of millions of innocent men and women, is almost unbearable. Yet even here, in the hell of the anonymous, there are touches of human dignity, of that Russian investment in resurrection. Gita Sereny Brigitte Hamann's Hitler's Vienna is a really original account of the young Hitler's years of political apprenticeship between 1907 and 1913. Mark Roseman's The Past in Hiding (Allen Lane, Penguin) is an extraordinary story of a life, particularly read - as I read it - in conjunction with Ian Kershaw's two volumes of Hitler biography - Hubris and Nemesis (Penguin), both of them richly annotated with previously unknown facts. I loved Simon Sebag Montefiore's Prince of Princes: The Life of Potemkin (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). George Monbiot's Captive State: The Corporate Takeover of Britain (Macmillan) confronts us with the corporate control of British hospitals, schools, universities and, indeed, the food we buy and eat. Scary. But I also read a lot of novels this past year, some new, some older: I loved Kent Haruf 's Plainsong and Niall Williams's Four Letters of Love (both Picador). And I have, with enormous pleasure, re-read Robert Harris's Archangel (Arrow), Richard North Patterson's The Final Judgement (Hutchinson), the perfect legal novel, and all the wonderful thrillers written by Michael Connelly (Orion). Mavis Cheek 'Not for horrid profs,' says Frank Kermode of his Shakespeare's Language (Allen Lane, Penguin) - and he's quite right. It's engaging and clear to read. One critic called Colm Toibin's The Blackwater Lightship (Picador) 'emotional choreography'. I'd add the word 'beautiful' to that. Three generations, three different beliefs, three women coming to terms with each other and themselves. With The World's Smallest Unicorn (Cape), Shena Mackay brings us 10 more immaculate short stories of human folly and fortune and finding the skull beneath the perm. A L Kennedy This year No Great Mischief (Cape) made Alasdair MacLeod's position as a master of prose even more firmly assured. This is a work of true lyricism, emotional intelligence and breathtakingly acute observation. Terry Eagleton Years ago, I read Mikhail Bakhtin's great classic of the carnivalesque, Rabelais and His World, and wondered why I had never heard of him before. There's now no doubt that this previously obscure Russian thinker, who is said to have torn up one of his own priceless manuscripts for cigarette paper, is one of the supreme literary thinkers of our time. To write the very best book on him to date is thus a remarkable achievement. Ken Hirschkop's Mikhail Bakhtin: An Aesthetic for Democracy (OUP) combines dogged work in the Russian archives with some brilliant insights to show Bakhtin's relevance to questions of politics and popular democracy today. Glen Baxter My contenders for book of the year would have to include Flick Knives and Forks (Zillah Bell Contemporary Art) by Anthony Earnshaw - a collection of the great English surrealists' aphorisms spiced with black humour. My next choice would be The Book of Leviathan (Sort of Books) by Peter Bleguad which is funny, enigmatic and beautifully limned - what more could one ask? Hermione Lee My book of the year is the Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai (Faber) edited by his friend Ted Hughes and by Daniel Weissbort.

I was also delighted by the dazzling stories of Peter Ho Davies, Equal Love (Granta) , and by Mich\u00e8le Roberts's deliciously sensual French novel, The Looking Glass (Virago).

Michael Foot Don't be misled by any neglect or false testimony into imagining that Rebecca West was not one of the great women of the century. Her Selected Letters, edited by Bonnie Kime Scott (Yale) should dispose of all such misconceptions.

Adam Phillips R. F. Langley's Collected Poems (Carcanet) has a new music of sense-making about it that is, in the way only poetry and music can be, like an illumination. Larry Siedentop's Democracy In Europe (Allen Lane, Penguin) has a remarkable clarity and exhilaration about something that runs the risk of becoming just another topic of debate. Richard Lewontin with The Triple Helix (Harvard) continues to be the scientist everyone should read.

And yet another revision: the third edition of Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan (Cassell) - the best book there is on Dylan, now better than ever. Peter Conrad Condemned to spend hours each week inching in and out of London along Western Avenue, I was fascinated by Edward Platt's Leadville: A Biography of the A40 (Picador). On a trek from White City to Hanger Lane, Platt investigates the lives of the roadside householders, and documents the death of their suburban dream. A small, gritty, monoxide-scented epic. Chris Patten Philip Roth's The Human Stain (Cape) is the best new novel I have read for years. It is a powerful, gripping story with some strong set-pieces. Roth is not afraid to wrestle with ideas, some of them unfashionable but troubling for any liberal conscience. The book I used most was the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopaedia of Plants and Flowers (Dorling Kindersley). I couldn't garden without it. Cressida Connolly The American Rick Moody is one of the most original and inventive of current fiction writers. His new short stories, Demonology (Faber), are touching and funny and downright odd. I very much enjoyed Kazuo Ishiguro's extraordinary novel, When We Were Orphans (Faber). My best book of the year was Carlo Gebler's Father &amp; I (Little, Brown ). Compassionate, wry and ringingly honest. And John Burnside 's new poems, the Asylum Dance (Cape), are pretty good, too. Steven Berkoff In characteristic style Peter Ackroyd pulls back the veil and lets us peer within, examining London with intense fascination in London: The Biography (Chatto &amp; Windus) . In Ackroyd's view we are invited to see London as a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic. It is a work on the level of Mayhew's London, raw and compelling. A Positively Final Appearance (Penguin) affords another view of London. Alec Guinness 's impeccably delicate prose is so undiluted you feel you can hear the old boy's voice.

All three of these debut publications could legitimately be characterised as overcast, but then, what is a novel if not the occasion to wallow in the miseries of others? <strong> From Caucasia, With Love </strong> is literary and ambitious, <strong> Bone House</strong> finely put together and comfortable, <strong> The Ice Harvest</strong> swift and stylish. </p> <p>If one has occasion to demur regarding the excellence of a novel, it is never a complaint about the bleakness of subject matter so much as a sense that it didn't let you wallow enough, did not let you deeply into a character's misery, did not make the misery sufficiently lifelike or fateful (or funny). From Caucasia, With Love is the account of a family break-up along racial lines. A marriage between a Boston brahmin and Harvard 'negro' in the mid-Sixties, when integration was an ideal, becomes untenable when negro becomes black and Black Power makes anything but racial delineation uncool. The black husband, white wife and two girls are all casualties, but the focus of the book is entirely on the younger daughter and her sense of identity as - with straight hair and light skin - ethnically African-American. </p> <p>In that sense, the book is about greyness, the results of mixing black and white. When the father takes up with a sexpot who knows how to shape frizzy hair (it seems to be her chief recommendation), he sweeps the older, darker, frizzy daughter off with him and his lover to Brazil, a country he believes to be race-blind, though at that point he certainly isn't. Birdy, as she is called, is left with her impetuous, furious, fat, hard-drinking blonde mama, who gets so involved with mad gun-smuggling black-power dudes that she has to go on the run, or thinks she has to. Birdy becomes Jessie, and the father is declared (for purposes of camouflage) not only dead but, rather than black, Jewish. </p> <p>The mother immediately sheds five stone and goes gay. The narrator passes in silence over four years on a lesbian commune, which for this child of strife and counterculture sound placidly benign. But passionate, extremist Mom reverts to rhetoric about feminism as a bourgeois hang-up and drags 'Jessie' off to live in small-town New Hampshire, where the pubescent girl takes up with the rural lumpen who relish words like spic, nigger and, on occasion, kike. </p> <p>This is a long book, and it earns its length; by the end, you feel the sadness of Birdy losing not only her father and her sister, but herself. As a narrator, however, she seems unable to untangle this moving tale from a kind of sociological documentary about race. One longs for greater art or style in the narration, instead of reportage, something non-chronological, letting the full force of what had been lost contrast with scenes of the young girl's life of pretence. For that, the author would have had to cling less tightly to Birdy's point of view. It would be a great plus, since the parents are by far the most interesting characters, but requires the kind of authorial maturity that places drama above a brief for sympathy. </p> <p> Bone House has smaller ambitions and, by its own lights, probably fulfils them. A mix of genres involving two sets of gothic secrets, it combines romance novel - plucky little heroine serving in 'great house' attracted to alluring man of higher station - with murder mystery: the universally admired town whore is found dead under possibly suspicious circumstances and is discovered to be pregnant. </p> <p>The year is 1603 and the highest ambitions of this work relate to historical accuracy. The villagers believe in witchcraft, and the heroine's lady employer takes religion very seriously. However, violations of period abound, as seems to be inevitable in period novels. The author makes careful points about the lack of social mobility, but the attractive characters are practically dizzying in the class leaps that they make, and the male love interest embodies a rather later period's ideal of attractiveness which lies in his being an artist. </p> <p>There are references to 'ambivalence' and 'romantic love,' as if the seventeenth-century English narrator had read - or anticipated - Freud. But one identifies with her longing for the warmth and largesse that the dead woman embodied, and, as readers of another era, we cannot help liking the psychic freedom represented by the artist. Take it as a sober fairy tale of upward mobility, culturally if not monetarily. In its case, greyness and sobriety are virtues. </p> <p> Ice Harvest intends to be not grey but black - noir, that is. It's Christmas Eve in a big town in Kansas, and Charlie Arglist, a lawyer who's become moneyman for the local mob (which means, effectively, the two strip joints and massage parlour in town), is cashing in his chips, intending to make off with what he's earned through cocaine deal ing and double-dealing as his big Christmas present to himself. </p> <p>By morning, he's committed not only his first murder but two others and been betrayed, as is de rigueur in noir, by the inevitable treacherous beauty. When Chandler and Hammett invented this genre, they may have been misanthropists, but they decided that if they had to hate themselves for being human, they would also love themselves for being a little bit better than everyone else in seeing it clearly. </p> <p>So they made heroes who had just that sense of honour or perspective that raised them up an inch. Arglist, however, is crummy to his wife and kids - you know he's gotta go. </p> <p>Therefore, this noir ends with a black joke and a view of humanity without highlights to show up the darkness.

But the numbers taking postgraduate certificates of education (PGCEs) remain dangerously low. In their PGCE year, students do not pay university fees; those in shortage subjects, such as maths, foreign languages and information technology, get a 'golden hello' of \u00a35,000, and, from this year, are paid \u00a36,000 training salaries.

In large parts of the South East, less than 2 per cent of the working-age population is looking for a job - a scenario regarded by economists as full employment. In some employment 'hot spots', unemployment is less than 1 per cent. That is good news for anyone coming into the job market in Britain's boom areas; but it is a headache for employers, who are having to offer higher salaries and find other ways of recruiting and keeping staff. </p> <p>Basingstoke and Newbury share the honour of having the lowest unemployment rates in the country, at just 0.8 per cent. In Newbury, there are 349 jobs on offer at the JobCentre, many in shops, warehouses and driving positions, plus a smattering of managerial openings. According to one member of staff, somebody with half-a-dozen GCSEs could expect to find a job 'almost immediately'. At Trainers Limited, an IT training company based in Basingstoke, managing director Janice Brown says: 'We sometimes get no responses at all to vacancies, even when it is through an agency - and that includes jobs paying \u00a340,000-50,000 a year.' She says the company often has to resort to word of mouth to find the right people, and has recruited from as far afield as Liverpool and Newcastle, as well as among people coming out of the forces. </p> <p>The key to keeping people is, she says, to provide continuous training rather than the highest pay. 'We review the position every six months, and find out what training they'd like in the next six months. It's quite unusual for somebody to leave if they're looking forward to their next training course.' At insurance company Winterthur, one of the biggest employers in Basingstoke, head of corporate communications Ginny Broad says one way of coping with low unemployment is to recruit from further afield. Jobs are advertised outside the immediate vicinity - in places such as Southampton, Guildford and Reading. </p> <p>The company also goes out of its way to pamper employees through benefits, working conditions and the overall environment. Staff get a non-contributory final salary pension - which is increasingly rare - and private health insurance after a year. Mothers are encouraged back to work by an option to negotiate flexible hours individually; and the company has even introduced a scheme for employees to 'buy' extra holiday if they want it. The spacious and comfortable offices are also a draw, says Broad. There are tennis courts, a gym, and a restaurant with outside garden. 'We are very active locally,' she adds. 'We sponsor the theatre and even the railway station. One of our objectives is to be seen as one of the best employers.' </p> <p>Not every employer can afford such generous perks as these. Alastair Hatchett, at Incomes Data Services, says: 'The problem in some areas is becoming one not just of skills shortages, but of people shortages.' He says the main tool used by employers to recruit and retain people is still pay. 'A company that was paying \u00a317,000 to recruit a skilled craftsman a year ago is probably having to pay \u00a320,000 today. They are effectively having to raise the recruitment rate.' </p> <p>Companies are also having interim pay reviews - so salaries may be increased twice instead of once a year to keep up, he says. And particular groups that are in short supply - IT, for example - are being upgraded within the organisation. </p> <p>Some employers have also been redefining their salary 'zones' to take account of where the employment hot spots are. Tesco, for example, has introduced a new zone system so that somebody working in Reading would earn as much as their counterpart in central London. Employers are also benchmarking their pay much more closely against competitors, he says. </p> <p>Companies are, to some extent, also looking further afield. For every employment hot spot in the South East, though, there is a cold spot elsewhere. Areas of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East still have unemployment levels in or approaching double-figure percentages and, in principle at least, provide an obvious pool for those in the hot spots to recruit from. The problem is the obvious one: housing. Towns such as Basingstoke, Newbury and Banbury are already suffering from shortages of housing, and for those coming from less affluent areas of the country prices must seem sky-high. </p> <p>'It is very difficult for somebody to bridge the gap from Tyneside to Slough,' points out Hatchett. 'And there is also the problem of the trailing spouse. Many couples are now dual-earner, and if one relocates, the other will want to find an equivalent job.' </p> <p>Back in Basingstoke, Barbara Bryant, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce, says: 'I was at a meeting with three large companies today, and they were talking about bringing in labour from eastern Europe, and even India. They were wondering how well it would work with the new work permit system.' </p> <p>She adds: 'I think companies are just beginning to get to grips with this problem, and to realise that it isn't going to go away.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Baltimore, Autonomy, Cisco, Yahoo - most of the giants of the new economy are new companies, often founded in someone's garage and usually located in a business park in Cambridge or California. </p> <p>Spirent sounds like one of these companies but has a rather more pedestrian home in Crawley, Sussex. Its name was dreamt up earlier this year to reflect its culture of 'inspired innovation'. Its business is firmly in the technology front-line, supplying probes and other equipment to make sure computer networks keep working. Its shares have turned in a convincingly new economy performance, soaring from around 90p two years ago to more than 600p, a rise almost eight times as fast as the rest of the stock market. </p> <p>The \u00a31.1 billion acquisition of Hekimian earlier this month, to extend the range of its testing services, was greeted with huge enthusiasm, sending its shares up a further 10 per cent. </p> <p>But Spirent is an atypical new economy company - and not just because it is already making respectable profits. It started business in 1936 and, until May, had the rather more familiar name of Bowthorpe. Under that moniker it had a reputation for producing solid, if unspectacular growth from an assortment of electronics businesses. Now it has joined the select band of traditional British businesses - others include Marconi, the former GEC, and Volex - who have adapted to take advantage of the rapid growth in technology. </p> <p>The transformation began five years ago when Nicholas Brookes took over as chief executive. What he found was a company with an entrepreneurial culture, the minimum of bureaucracy and head office functionaries, but with a wide spread of businesses that had little or no contact with each other. It had almost 100 operating units working in 27 different markets. The issue was how to accelerate the steady growth rate it had enjoyed over the previous 10 years. </p> <p>'It became obvious that, if we wanted to be four times the size, we did not need 400 operating units in 130 markets. It was also obvious that we could not afford to invest in all 100 operating businesses. We had to focus on high-growth, high- margin, high-technology businesses.' </p> <p>After a year spent analysing the company, its markets and its people, Brookes decided to concentrate on just five global businesses. The first of these, telecommunications, had only just come into the group when Brookes arrived, through the purchase of a US company called TAS, which was in wireless communications testing. Its rise has been meteoric: turnover has risen from just \u00a33.5 million in 1995 to \u00a3114.7m - a fifth of the group - in 1999. </p> <p>That growth is getting faster: in the first half of this year turnover more than trebled - partly due to acquisitions but there was also 80 per cent organic growth. Following the acquisition of Hekimian, this division will account for 80 per cent of group sales. </p> <p>Brookes was attracted to telecommunications for two reasons. The market was very fragmented, with lots of private businesses concentrated on particular areas - wireless, local area networks and so on. But it also looked likely to grow rapidly.

      "bodyText": "Baltimore, Autonomy, Cisco, Yahoo - most of the giants of the new economy are new companies, often founded in someone's garage and usually located in a business park in Cambridge or California. Spirent sounds like one of these companies but has a rather more pedestrian home in Crawley, Sussex. Its name was dreamt up earlier this year to reflect its culture of 'inspired innovation'. Its business is firmly in the technology front-line, supplying probes and other equipment to make sure computer networks keep working. Its shares have turned in a convincingly new economy performance, soaring from around 90p two years ago to more than 600p, a rise almost eight times as fast as the rest of the stock market. The \u00a31.1 billion acquisition of Hekimian earlier this month, to extend the range of its testing services, was greeted with huge enthusiasm, sending its shares up a further 10 per cent. But Spirent is an atypical new economy company - and not just because it is already making respectable profits. It started business in 1936 and, until May, had the rather more familiar name of Bowthorpe. Under that moniker it had a reputation for producing solid, if unspectacular growth from an assortment of electronics businesses. Now it has joined the select band of traditional British businesses - others include Marconi, the former GEC, and Volex - who have adapted to take advantage of the rapid growth in technology. The transformation began five years ago when Nicholas Brookes took over as chief executive. What he found was a company with an entrepreneurial culture, the minimum of bureaucracy and head office functionaries, but with a wide spread of businesses that had little or no contact with each other. It had almost 100 operating units working in 27 different markets. The issue was how to accelerate the steady growth rate it had enjoyed over the previous 10 years. 'It became obvious that, if we wanted to be four times the size, we did not need 400 operating units in 130 markets. It was also obvious that we could not afford to invest in all 100 operating businesses. We had to focus on high-growth, high- margin, high-technology businesses.' After a year spent analysing the company, its markets and its people, Brookes decided to concentrate on just five global businesses. The first of these, telecommunications, had only just come into the group when Brookes arrived, through the purchase of a US company called TAS, which was in wireless communications testing. Its rise has been meteoric: turnover has risen from just \u00a33.5 million in 1995 to \u00a3114.7m - a fifth of the group - in 1999. That growth is getting faster: in the first half of this year turnover more than trebled - partly due to acquisitions but there was also 80 per cent organic growth. Following the acquisition of Hekimian, this division will account for 80 per cent of group sales. Brookes was attracted to telecommunications for two reasons. The market was very fragmented, with lots of private businesses concentrated on particular areas - wireless, local area networks and so on. But it also looked likely to grow rapidly. 'I thought that, if we could pull them together under one umbrella, and invest in them, we could have a great business.' Bowthorpe already had a good reputation for acquiring entrepreneurial companies and integrating them successfully so Brookes could build on that. The secret, he says, is 'understanding, putting yourself in the shoes of the entrepreneur'. Many large corporations will 'put money on the table, promise to invest such and such in your business - and then say this is how you will do things now. That will turn off an entrepreneurial company. Their values are very different to large public corporations.' Brookes works hard to make sure bureaucracy does not creep in. Once it starts, it is hard to get rid of. Head office is slim - there are no centralised human resources, marketing or other administrative departments. 'We give a lot of authority to people. We act fast. There is a strong financial team and a mergers and acquisitions department at head office, but that is it. We put all the cash into the business.' He admits that the bigger the company gets, the harder it is to keep bureaucracy out - the Hekimian acquisitions will add at least 50 per cent to sales of Spirent's communications division. 'The key is to carry on as we do, to keep the priority investing in people.' As part of that, Spirent has developed what it calls a technical ladder, a system that allows its specialist engineers, scientists and other professionals to progress their careers within their specialist areas, instead of forcing them to shift into management - something many of them have little aptitude for or interest in. The communications division has been the star in the last five years but the other divisions - network systems, cable management and sensing solutions - have also grown rapidly, mainly on the foundation of existing businesses. Brookes found, for example, that Bowthorpe had an excellent network systems business operating in Germany, Japan, the US and Britain.

And, if the new economy proves as lucrative as Spirent hopes, that could be just the beginning.",
