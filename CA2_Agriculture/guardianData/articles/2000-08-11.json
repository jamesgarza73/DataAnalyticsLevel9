      "body": "<p>Unlike many writers who claim that they avoid reading other people's work when they are creating their own, Patricia Duncker says her voracious reading habit is entirely unchanged whether she is writing or not. \"I simply couldn't write if I wasn't reading,\" she explains. \"It would be like working in a void.\" But that said, it was not her love and admiration for books that set her on a literary career. Instead it was rather less straightforward love and admiration for a writer. The poet Patricia Beer, who died last year, was her aunt. The two women had a difficult personal relationship, but Beer was undoubtedly Duncker's main influence. \"Not in terms of what I write but in how I think,\" Duncker says. \"If you look, a lot of writers do seem to have another writer somewhere in their lives. She was the writer in mine.\" </p> <p>Duncker was brought up in 1950s Jamaica, where her mother was English and a teacher, and her father was Jamaican and a businessman. She remembers her \"sexy aunt\" visiting and representing everything that Europe stood for. \"She was glamorous and widely travelled and extremely well read. I showed her my poems when I was about 12 and she was the first person to take me seriously. She told me, very politely, what was good and what was nonsense.\" </p> <p>Childhood reading was idiosyncratically colonial. Along with the obligatory Kipling, by the age of 10 Duncker had also read Winston Churchill's History of the Second World War and Fitzroy Maclean's Conversations with Tito . \"I read them as adventure stories,\" she laughs. \"But when I went to school in England aged 13 I had to catch up pretty quickly with Malory Towers and things like that.\" </p> <p>She went on to read English at university and then did post-graduate work on English and German romanticism. She now teaches English and writing at the University of Wales in Aberystwyth but she always \"had it in my head that I wanted to be a writer. I had been instructed by Patricia that this is what I should do, so it was a little like a Mission: Impossible assignment where, once I had accepted, I just had to get on with it\". </p> <p>Duncker says that Beer, who was her guardian when she arrived in England, never actually liked her, and certainly didn't pass comment on her mature writing. \"But even if we didn't talk together about writing, I read everything she wrote and she has shaped my mind. I hugely admire her ruthless imagination. There is a real ice-queen chill in her writing. And she taught me a commitment to excellence: never be sloppy, go to the sixth, seventh, eighth revision, leave your best scenes on the cutting-room floor. Work work work.\" </p> <p>This stringent approach has contributed to Duncker still having an unpublished three-volume novel in a drawer at home, as well as bundles of unseen poetry. She thinks more novels that do see the light of day should be kept in drawers, and claims even if she never had anything published she would continue to write. \"Some of the people I most admire were never published in their lifetime, like Emily Dickinson. Even Emily Bront\u00eb didn't want to publish.\" </p> <p>Duncker's first novel, Hallucinating Foucault , was eventually published in 1996. Part thriller, part love story, part philosophical exploration, it was widely acclaimed and picked up a series of first-novel prizes. She says that while it is obviously gratifying to win prizes, the most exciting thing is to have more readers. \"I know how thrilling it is for me to read a book that excites me, so to think I might have given that pleasure to someone else is wonderful.\" </p> <p>Her collection of short stories, Monsieur Shoushana's Lemon Trees , was published in 1997 and the paperback edition of her second novel, James Miranda Barry , comes out this month. Duncker had initially used the true story of the 19th-century military doctor who lived her life as a man in her very first piece of published writing. It appeared in a 1989 anthology of short stories, but her subsequent attempt to write a novel based on the character stalled after 100 pages when she couldn't resolve the problem of saying \"him\" or \"her\" in the narration. In 1997 she tried again and, using both first and third-person narration, cracked the technical problems. The resulting book is an absorbing literary-historical novel that probes with an exuberant intelligence the complex relationship between what things are and what they seem. </p> <p>Duncker's next project is editing a volume of short stories written by women in Wales, and she will then complete a new novel. \"It's set in the contemporary world but will be very gothic and very scary. I love the horror genre. I think the reason crime fiction has become so respectable is that the French literary establishment has thrown its weight behind it, but this hasn't happened yet with horror. There are so many possibilities and resonances.\" </p> <p>Not least in her own life. She says Patricia Beer was something like a doppelg\u00e4nger for her. \"I was named after her and people say we sound the same. She has been a sort of shadow, and I think I have always written both for her and against her. While I didn't get on with her as a person, I really, really admired her as a writer. So much so that it has been a pain to me that I have never been able to say so. She was quite a dangerous person to know and she would have taken it as a sort of attack. But I can't overstate how much she goes on being important to me.\" </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of James Miranda Barry (Picador, rrp \u00a36.99) for \u00a34.99 plus 99p p&amp;p call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

The result was passably witty but, as one often feels about coterie novels, of limited interest to anyone outside Soho and N1 who doesn't care that Reviewer A is copping off with Writer B. </p> <p>In her fourth novel Craig has again made use of a literary theme, although far more obliquely and with less possibility of comeback, as Sylvia Plath, like her fictional counterpart here, a children's illustrator called Laura, committed suicide more than 30 years ago. As well as this violent end, Laura shared with Plath a streak of psychosis, an unruly talent and a faithless husband. And she left behind a child, Benedick, who has matured into a grade-A disaster: at the novel's opening, his wife Georgie has abandoned him and taken their two children with her; his acting career has dwindled to walk-on parts in unheralded low-budget Britflicks; and he is slowly engulfed by a depression that renders him virtually incapable of leaving the room loaned to him by old family friend and maternal stand-in, Jewish shrink Ruth. </p> <p>Benedick's one lifeline appears to be a burgeoning interest in his mother, stimulated by a book of her fairy tales that he discovers when divvying up the marital spoils. \"I picked it up,\" he tells us. \"I didn't know then, how dangerous fairy tales can be.\" By the end of the novel, however, the reader will feel more than fully versed in the perils not only of creepy woods and wicked witches but of paper-thin psychodramas too. </p> <p>\"Isn't absolutely everything a symbol of the unconscious to you lot?\" rails Benedick to Ruth, with whom he has been discussing the imagery of his mother's fairy tales. \"Well - not absolutely everything,\" she replies calmly. \"And I'm a psychotherapist, not a psychiatrist.\" That almost comic error (psycho-therapists tell you why you direct traffic naked when you're asleep and can't get a boyfriend; psychiatrists peer at rats in mazes and dole out big shiny pills) is characteristic of the kind of clich\u00e9d over-simplification on display here, which sees Benedick getting madder and madder. As we survey dead mother, awful dad, absent wife, terrible career and life going nowhere, it's hardly surprising that the man can't cope. </p> <p>But there's far more grimness in store when Benedick sets off to North Carolina, where his mother's ageing sister resides in fading splendour . Gripped by the manic depression that did for his mother, he has several nasty things waiting for him in the woodshed. It's unfortunate that, largely because he is so vile to his own small son, our sympathy is fast converted to antipathy. Therein lies Craig's biggest problem, as the reader struggles to find a single character to like in any decent measure. It's a shame, because one doesn't care to be flippant about mental illnesses or the legacy of suicide. But to portray all this in fiction is a challenging business, and on the evidence of In a Dark Wood , something for which we will have to wait a little longer.</p>",

If I could believe my ears I would keep the old sayings close, a carpet of blaeberry, cowberry, moss on the steep slopes springing under my feet, the slow, wet sobs of the bog on the cross-leaved heath, the purple moor grass loomed by the breeze. If I could believe my ears the old stone songs of the moine schist rocks are singing me on, the high folk songs in the glen, a silver stone in the brown river calling the tune, where I turn to the ancient stare of a shy red deer. The past believes it is still here. \u0095 This poem was specially commissioned by BBC Poetry Proms, which are broadcast on Radio 3 during the interval of every Wednesday's Prom.",

Italy had surrendered, Austria was being seriously bombed for the first time, the casualty lists from the eastern front were lengthening and there was much complaining in what the Nazis called the Ostmark. In an attempt to induce a rising - or at least to cause trouble - the Allies issued the Moscow Declaration, which described Austria as \"the first free country to fall victim to Hitlerite aggression\", pledged to establish an independent Austria after the war and called on Austrians to contribute to their own liberation. </p> <p>It fell on deaf ears. There was no revolt, and no great increase in an internal resistance that had always been modest in scale. But the Moscow Declaration proved of extraordinary significance once peace came. It was the birth certificate of post-war Austria, enshrining a fiction which both the Allies and the Austrians knew to be untrue, but which everybody found so useful that it was maintained for decades. </p> <p>Its consequences are still with us today. In her timely book, Hella Pick skilfully traces the line that, through the twists and turns of nearly 60 years of Austrian and international politics, connects the Declaration to Jorg Haider today. A child refugee from Austria who was brought up in England, Pick later frequently returned as a Guardian correspondent to the country of her birth. She has been on close terms with some of its great men, including Bruno Kreisky and Simon Wiesenthal. One virtue of her account is that it demonstrates how the concept of Austria as victim of the Nazis was, stage by stage, a product of collusion between the new state and its western friends. Another is that it shows how Austria's denial of its Nazi past, and continuing appeasement of those Austrians who clung to that past, perplexingly coexisted with a genuinely humane tradition. That tradition made it a country of refuge for hundreds of thousands fleeing the eastern bloc, a neutral state which took courageous diplomatic initiatives and an admired social and economic model. </p> <p>The Declaration was wrong on every count. Austria was not a free country in 1938, but its citizens freely welcomed the Nazis - and with an enthusiasm that went beyond anything seen in Germany. The Austrian Nazis enrolled proportionally more members during the war years than the party did in Germany. According to one analysis, Austrians, who constituted 8 per cent of the population of Greater Germany, provided 14 per cent of the SS and an amazing 40 per cent of the men in killing units such as those at concentration camps. When the post-war Austrian leadership looked at the problem of de-Nazification it recoiled in horror, for registered Nazis and their families constituted a third of the population. Many of them, of course, were ordinary men and women who could be defined as victims of their times. But the public reconciliation between Austrian conservatives and social demo crats, whose hostility to one another had contributed so much to the country's inter-war troubles, was matched by a hidden compromise with this ex-Nazi constituency. </p> <p>Austrians, the author writes, \"mentally mislaid the Hitler years\", a trick which allowed politicians to work with the parties that drew on that constituency. As she shows, political arrangements with the Freedom Party and its predecessors are nothing new. They were in and out of bed with the the Social Democratic Party for nearly 40 years, until Chancellor Franz Vranitzky brought the alliance to an end when Haider became the Freedom Party leader. Perhaps it is understandable that the Freedom Party complains about being pilloried today for doing what the Social Democratic Party did in the past with only intermittent controversy, both inside and outside Austria. </p> <p>But Haider is a different kind of leader from his predecessors, and the party is no longer on the margins of Austrian politics. What is more, the reasons why the world turned a blind eye have all but disappeared. The cold war is over, Austria is in the European Union, the understanding of the second world war and of the fate of the Jews has shifted and the dangers of xenophobic nationalism have been freshly demonstrated in the Balkans. Furthermore, right-wing extremism is a significant problem in several western democracies. From the mid-80s on, with the scandal over Kurt Waldheim's election as president, the Austrian political establishment has increasingly been ready to face the truth about the past and, belatedly, to offer some restitution. The unhappy fact is that these are precisely the years in which Haider and the Freedom Party have prospered. The problem this represents is not Austria's alone. As in the past, the theatre of Austrian politics is both that of a small and rather provincial country and that of the world - a difficult combination for both sides, as this book makes amply clear.</p>",

No. Better take down this book, Old Age in English History: Past Experiences, Present Issues by Pat Thane, professor of contemporary history at the University of Sussex, which is a challenge to all the usual tired, blasted, ragged, shrivelled, chicken-skinned, catnapping, Tiresias-dugged, slack-throated, liver-spotted, incontinent and Celtic Twilight twaddling assumptions about ageing and old age. </p> <p>But of course, \"Age is not a particularly interesting subject\", or so claimed Groucho Marx (1895-1977). No again.

Just off the top of my head, and with the assistance of a set of encyclopaedias, since my memory is not quite what it was: Verdi composed Otello at 73; Henry James wrote The Golden Bowl at 61; Pasternak didn't see Dr Zhivago published until he was 67; Marx finally finished Capital aged 61. David Ben-Gurion became prime minister of Israel at 62; Menachem Begin, like Disraeli, didn't make it until he was 63; Reagan did it at 69; Gladstone bounced back for the third time at 76. John Wayne starred in True Grit at 62; Alec Guinness became George Smiley at 65; and Colonel Harlan Sanders franchised Kentucky Fried Chicken at 66, the same age at which Michaelangelo completed the Last Judgment. </p> <p>Pat Thane makes the obvious but nonetheless compelling point that there is no such thing as an undifferentiated group, \"old people\", any more than there are, say, \"young people\", \"fat people\" or \"rude people\".\"The age group which is most generalised about,\" writes Thane in timeless academic prose, \"in fact incorporates a greater variety of ages, of social, economic and physical conditions than any other age group.\" Or to put it another way: old age is like a plate of mixed biscuits. </p> <p>\"With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days under- standing\", reasoned Job (dates unknown). No, no and thrice no. (Just reading about old age seems to make you curmudgeonly.) \"In no time or place,\" counters Thane, \"is it evident that old age, especially very old age, is especially valued in itself, independently of the attributes of specific old people. Nor that in 'the past' or in 'other cultures', old, as distinct from middle-aged, people in general were repositories of knowledge and skill in contrast to their obsolescence in fast-moving modern cultures.\" </p> <p>As Thane further points out, in medieval and early modern England the witness of a few old men may have been relied upon as legal evidence of ancient custom in property disputes, but if you were an old woman in possession of traditional knowledge - midwifery, say - you were just as likely to have been burned as a witch. </p> <p>In 24 careful chapters Thane surveys the evidence of the vigorous and varied lives of the elderly from pre-modern England to the present; her conclusions are never less than shocking. It was never the custom, for instance, for generations to share a home; the idea of \"structured dependency\" relies on a myth of well-paid and dignified work; the experience of ageing has always depended upon whether you are rich or poor, male or female; and extreme old age does not necessarily mean ill health. </p> <p>There is a clear and signal purpose to these numerous claims and challenges. The world may be facing an ageing population, but is this necessarily a problem? No. \"The generations do not have to compete for resources in the future, but can share them equitably...

(A talent for that is what has sustained them, after all.) And in this collection there is very much the sense of naughtiness you get at a convention: the delegates here are running down the corridors in the middle of the night, letting off figurative fire-extinguishers, and generally letting their hair down. </p> <p>Instructive, too, if not bracing, for Guardian readers to be exposed to the kind of names that may only exist on the periphery of their nightmares: Petronella Wyatt, say (who disingenuously does not declare why she feels so moved to make an inaccurate complaint about Julie Burchill), Niall Ferguson, Peter McKay, and indeed Stephen Glover himself, regular Guardian diary joke-butt, who provides the illuminating confession that \"at the comparatively tender age of twenty-six... I had found myself writing editorials for the Daily Telegraph on all manner of things about which I often knew absolutely nothing\". </p> <p>But let's concentrate on the good stuff - and salute Glover for having got so much of it in. It begins with Francis Wheen's sprightly essay on nostalgia for the old days of Fleet Street, with which this book is saturated (the thing about nostalgia, of course, is that by definition it never goes away); it is an unconscious companion piece for Michael Frayn's introductory essay to Towards the End of the Morning , recently republished by Faber and almost as essential a Fleet Street novel as Scoop. </p> <p>Henry Porter writes well about editors (a wish to save my professional bacon saving me from saying any more); Carol Sarler makes a good case for the tabloids; Fiammetta Rocco, an in-depth profiler, explains why you shouldn't be the subject of an in-depth profile; Paul Foot has a good old go at Maxwell and other demons (\"the editor of this collection foolishly urges me to indulge myself in my own experiences, so here goes\"). </p> <p>Richard Ingrams reminds would-be litigants about the dangers of litigation; when Nora Beloff chose, perhaps reasonably, to take at face value an assertion in Private Eye that she had slept with every member of the Wilson cabinet, although \"no impropriety occurred\", she sued, and won. Auberon Waugh had his revenge when writing about her marriage, at the age of 56. \"Even as I write, Clifford Makins is exploring the unimaginable delights of her body, never sweeter than when first sampled.\" (Oddly, he doesn't mention her PE nickname, \"Nora Balsoff\".) </p> <p>Nostalgia, I think, is fine when you have something to be nostalgic about. Anyone with a sense of linguistic humour is going to enjoy the occasional reminiscences of cable-ese, those terse correspondences that would close with telegrams reading \"my balls unmade crystal\", \"why you unswim shark-infested sea query\" - or, the best ever, and unimprovable for as long as humanity endures, \"Upstuff job arsewards\". </p> <p>The prognosis for the industry is not too bleak. Of course, the underlying message from each contributor is that any industry that employs him or her is not in such bad shape; but I am glad that Ann Leslie, the brave and cunning foreign correspondent, is still working. She reminds us of the only advice would-be journalists need on what it takes: a plausible manner, rat-like cunning, and a little literary ability.

It begins with Francis Wheen's sprightly essay on nostalgia for the old days of Fleet Street, with which this book is saturated (the thing about nostalgia, of course, is that by definition it never goes away); it is an unconscious companion piece for Michael Frayn's introductory essay to Towards the End of the Morning , recently republished by Faber and almost as essential a Fleet Street novel as Scoop. Henry Porter writes well about editors (a wish to save my professional bacon saving me from saying any more); Carol Sarler makes a good case for the tabloids; Fiammetta Rocco, an in-depth profiler, explains why you shouldn't be the subject of an in-depth profile; Paul Foot has a good old go at Maxwell and other demons (\"the editor of this collection foolishly urges me to indulge myself in my own experiences, so here goes\"). Richard Ingrams reminds would-be litigants about the dangers of litigation; when Nora Beloff chose, perhaps reasonably, to take at face value an assertion in Private Eye that she had slept with every member of the Wilson cabinet, although \"no impropriety occurred\", she sued, and won. Auberon Waugh had his revenge when writing about her marriage, at the age of 56. \"Even as I write, Clifford Makins is exploring the unimaginable delights of her body, never sweeter than when first sampled.\" (Oddly, he doesn't mention her PE nickname, \"Nora Balsoff\".) Nostalgia, I think, is fine when you have something to be nostalgic about. Anyone with a sense of linguistic humour is going to enjoy the occasional reminiscences of cable-ese, those terse correspondences that would close with telegrams reading \"my balls unmade crystal\", \"why you unswim shark-infested sea query\" - or, the best ever, and unimprovable for as long as humanity endures, \"Upstuff job arsewards\". The prognosis for the industry is not too bleak. Of course, the underlying message from each contributor is that any industry that employs him or her is not in such bad shape; but I am glad that Ann Leslie, the brave and cunning foreign correspondent, is still working. She reminds us of the only advice would-be journalists need on what it takes: a plausible manner, rat-like cunning, and a little literary ability. Enjoy. \u0095 To order this book for \u00a36.99 plus 99p p&amp;p call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

Will he save his little brother from the playground bully or run off and get a teacher? The USP of Newman's novel is that you, dear reader, decide. If A turn to chapter 4, if B take chapter 3 and so on. The hero's life is in your hands, and choices - as Newman bangs home - have unforeseen consequences, which might make Life's Lottery an epic read or reduce its 600 pages to a slim novella. It is a gimmick that works better in the reading than in the telling. Choice, however, is not infinite, and whatever decisions you make, the writing is less exciting than the format. </p> <p> <strong> Teeth &amp; Spies, by Giorgio Pressburger (Granta, \u00a36.99)</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502141940.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p> Teeth &amp; Spies is just that - the dental biography of SG, from the moment his father swallows his first milk tooth in a concentration camp to the fitting of his dentures 50 years later. A chapter per tooth takes SG around the world in government service, suffering toothache in his first upper right premolar whenever a world leader is assassinated and being forced by a Barcelona dentist to ransom his Jewish faith to his oral hygiene.

      "bodyText": "Life's Lottery, by Kim Newman (Pocket Books, \u00a37.99) Buy it at BOL Does Keith Marion like Napoleon Solo or Ilya Kuryakin? Will he save his little brother from the playground bully or run off and get a teacher? The USP of Newman's novel is that you, dear reader, decide. If A turn to chapter 4, if B take chapter 3 and so on. The hero's life is in your hands, and choices - as Newman bangs home - have unforeseen consequences, which might make Life's Lottery an epic read or reduce its 600 pages to a slim novella. It is a gimmick that works better in the reading than in the telling. Choice, however, is not infinite, and whatever decisions you make, the writing is less exciting than the format. Teeth &amp; Spies, by Giorgio Pressburger (Granta, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Teeth &amp; Spies is just that - the dental biography of SG, from the moment his father swallows his first milk tooth in a concentration camp to the fitting of his dentures 50 years later. A chapter per tooth takes SG around the world in government service, suffering toothache in his first upper right premolar whenever a world leader is assassinated and being forced by a Barcelona dentist to ransom his Jewish faith to his oral hygiene.

With her hundredth birthday approaching at the speed of an express train, Kate is engaged in a race against time with a difference: she wants her life to crash into the buffers before she has to listen to the Queen's telemessage and a rousing chorus of \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\", but not before she's worked out which of her three sons is responsible for the murder of her fourth - or is it fifth? - husband, Graham Eldridge. Confined to bed after suffering a massive stroke, Kate is alert and rational. Although she retains limited power of movement, she feigns paralysis in order that she may, free of distractions, replay the mental video of her life and, she hopes, eliminate two of her sons from suspicion of murder. </p> <p>Her life story is a spellbinding narrative that spans the 20th century from the battle of the Somme to Kosovan refugees, taking in the General Strike, the Great Depression, the war against Hitler and much else besides. The focus, however, is always personal. Born into a strictly puritanical Welsh family and brought up in Swansea, Kate is one of five children. She herself has four children - her three sons, Maurice, Nigel and Timothy, and a daughter, Elizabeth - with various husbands. Her life is initially shaped, like those of so many other young women at that time, by the death in the Great War of her childhood sweetheart, Gwyn, with whom she had enjoyed one glorious, illicit night of passion. </p> <p>Leaving home to become a schoolteacher in Penzance, she finds herself joining an artists' colony instead and marrying Arturo, who dresses all in purple and hits upon the idea of hanging his canvases upside down. The art world is just one of the targets for Nobbs's unerringly accurate satirical darts. He pricks the bubble of pompous artists' pretensions and, later in the novel, highlights the cynical ruthlessness of a gallery owner who waits to mount a major exhibition of a talented painter's work until after the artist is dead, because he is aware that the work will only become fashionable with the artist's passing. </p> <p>Kate is a superbly realised character: a strong, passionate woman with an unquenchable thirst for life and a keen social conscience. She carries a certain amount of guilt, but wears it lightly. She can be naive as well as wise, foolishly sacrificing her marriage to a wealthy industrialist by becoming ensnared in a trap involving industrial rather than conjugal relations. She is enormously loving towards her family, without allowing sentimentality to blind her to their faults. Like Nobbs's most famous creation, Reginald Perrin, she is an iconoclast and a rebel, and always heroic in her championing of the underdog. And, just like the Reginald Perrin novels, Going Gently is enormously entertaining and extremely funny. </p> <p>David Nobbs didn't get where he is today without understanding the value of a good catchphrase. Kate's family members have one each. Brother Bernard tags \"I beg your pardon?\" on the end of any comment he judges to be at all challenging or radical - that is, every time he opens his mouth. Sister Enid has an endless supply of cautionary tales about local people dying tragicomic deaths, while Kate's other brother, Oliver, constantly reminds everybody that his socially repellent wife Bunny is a great mixer. But there's more to Nobbs's humour than catchphrases: longer, more intricate jokes lace the narrative, and no matter how far back you trace any of them, they never appear forced or contrived. </p> <p>The tone is not light throughout. Kate's life, inevitably since she is as old as the century, is frequently touched by tragedy. But by letting us know in advance - to a certain extent - what a rough time she has in store, Nobbs manages to avoid the danger of her story appearing an implausible catalogue of disasters. He performs a perfect balancing act between seriousness and fun, comedy and tragedy. This is a consistently entertaining and very moving book that somehow manages both to affirm life and to welcome death with open arms - or, as in one of Nobbs's gags involving Kate and the flies of sculptor Stanley Wainwright's pyjama trousers, to open it with welcoming arms. </p> <p>\u0095 Nicholas Royle's new novel, The Director's Cut, has just been published by Abacus.

Number Nine by Cecil Balmond, The French Mathematician by Tom Petsinis and Leaning Towards Infinity by Sue Woolfe all caused minor stirs; earlier this year Apostolos Doxiadis's Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture hit the headlines by offering a $1m prize for whomever could solve the eponymous problem. Now we have The Parrot's Theorem by Denis Guedj and, coming next year, The Wild Numbers by Philibert Schogt. </p> <p>These books are neither as gripping as a Stephen King novel nor as literary as a Booker Prize winner, but they have a different objective from most other fiction - to smuggle mathematical concepts into the mind of the unsuspecting reader by wrapping the maths inside an engaging plot. The question is, does this new genre of fictional maths succeed? </p> <p>The boom in maths books began when non-fiction authors started to write about mathematicians as well as mathematics, placing the intellectual concepts within a framework of history and human stories. The intention was to capture the reader's imagination for long enough to persuade him or her that understanding mathematical ideas and proofs can be a rewarding and enthralling experience. </p> <p>Some of the finer exponents of this style of mathematical writing include Paul Hoffman (author of The Man who Loved Only Number ) and Sylvia Nasar (A Beautiful Mind). In the wider area of general science, Dava Sobel has succeeded in introducing the work of John Harrison (inventor of the marine chronometer) and the ideas of Galileo to hundreds of thousands of readers. This style of writing has been dubbed narrative non-fiction. </p> <p>The majority of popularisers are attempting to convey the wonder of an esoteric subject to readers who would normally run a mile at the mere mention of trigonometry. The good news is that narrative non-fiction has been relatively successful in taking mathematics to a new readership, but perhaps the new pure-fiction approach can reach out to an even wider audience. </p> <p>There is inevitably a level of compromise. The novelist seems doomed either to have the flow of the plot interrupted by equations or to omit the meaning of mathematics; without the nitty-gritty of maths it is impossible to convey any of the beauty of the subject. In Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture , Doxiadis is fortunate in having at the heart of his story a problem that is simple to explain. In 1742, the Prussian-born Christian Goldbach suggested that every even number bigger than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers: 6=3+3, 8=5+3, 10=7+3... (A prime number is one that cannot be divided by any number except 1 and itself, such as 5 or 7.) </p> <p>For 200 years every even number that has been tested has obeyed Goldbach's conjecture, but nobody has ever been able to prove that the conjecture holds true for every even number up to infinity. Having established the problem without traumatising the reader, Doxiadis spends the rest of the novel concentrating on his characters and plot, in particular Petros Papachristos and his quest to prove the conjecture. The result is a highly readable novel about what drives mathematicians to spend decades searching for solutions to apparently insoluble problems. </p> <p>By comparison, The Parrot's Theorem contains considerably more mathematics. Denis Guedj, Professor of the History of Science at Paris VIII University, has constructed a Sophie's World -type schema that enables him to use a child as a channel for explaining numerous mathematical ideas to his readers. The bizarre plot concerns a mathematical hermit in the Amazon jungle, an evil criminal genius, a murder mystery, a Parisian bookseller and a deaf child called Max who encounters an exceptionally eloquent parrot. </p> <p>Along the way Max learns about 2,000 years of mathematics, which means that there are large sections discussing topics such as geometry, arithmetic, zero, imaginary numbers and calculus. Non-mathematicians will find some of these pages heavy going, but if they can persevere and comprehend the lines of logic, the consequence will be a genuine insight into the wonder of numbers. Unfortunately, no easy alternative exists when it comes to learning about mathematics, as Ptolemy II learned when he asked Euclid if there was a shortcut to understanding geometry. Euclid replied: \"There is no royal road to geometry.\" </p> <p>The plot is just about engaging enough to maintain the reader's momentum through the didactic sections. If further sustenance is required, one can look forward to Guedj's charming historical detours. For example, he describes the ethos of the Pythagorean Brotherhood. When a disciple entered the Brotherhood, he had to give all his worldly goods to the community. For five years students could only listen to Pythagoras's teaching from behind a curtain . . . Those who failed the tests of the Brotherhood were expelled, but were given twice the value of the goods that they had originally contributed. If they could not gain intellectually, then they should be compensated materially. A grave was dug within the grounds of the school, symbolising the tragedy of having lost a potential mathematician. </p> <p>So Guedj's novel contains a pleasant plot, some excellent mathematical lectures and great historical tales, but how does it compare to books about real mathematics? I may be biased, but none of the fictional mathematics that I have so far read quite matches the standard of the narrative non-fiction currently being published. Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers is a brilliant biography of Paul Erd\u00f6s, one the great mathematicians of the 20th century, who dedicated his entire life to proving mathematical theorems. Erd\u00f6s also had a penchant for one-liners that are as witty as any that a novelist could fabricate. </p> <p>Sylvia Nasar's A Beautiful Mind is the story of John Nash, who did his greatest mathematics in his twenties before succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia. The book is an elementary introduction to game theory, but it is also a romance, a tragedy and an examination of madness and its treatments in the 1950s and 1960s. In both these cases, the truth is stranger than any mathematical fiction.</p>",

Like the others, it is fraught with a tension between wanting to devote as much space to the famous as possible while maintaining the integrity of its project. Augusta Leigh (1783-1851) was the half-sister of the poet Lord Byron. She was also his lover. Aside from that, she does not appear to have been a very remarkable person. One might say she did no more than provide the means for her histrionic relative to prove himself right about what he had always suspected: that he was doomed to be a villain and an outcast. </p> <p>The truth is less simple than that. Byron fled the country in 1816 because his wife, Annabella, was levelling three accusations at him as part of divorce proceedings: as well as incest (not then technically a crime), he was charged with homosexuality and heterosexual sodomy (both then crimes). His conviction that he had married the wrong woman drove him to treat his wife with unforgivable cruelty. In the final stages of her pregnancy he would station himself in the room below her bedroom and throw soda-water bottles at the ceiling to keep her awake. </p> <p>Subtract Augusta from Byron's life, and he would still have found a way to get himself ostracised. Subtract Byron from Augusta's life, and what is left? The answer is an existence caught curiously between the distinctive and the obscure. Augusta was brought up at the likes of Holdernesse House and Castle Howard, before moving into the uncomfortably small Six Mile Bottom near Newmarket. Her penchant for dashing rakes - her husband and cousin, George, was one, though not in Byron's league - was the only eccentricity in a shy and practical nature. </p> <p>The Bakewells save their subject matter from this dangerous equivocality by the sureness of their descriptive touch. We read of the gambling, the gossip, the parties and the daily domestic arrangements. The sketch of George Leigh is particularly memorable. A sporting bore, he seems to have named one daughter, Medora, after a horse; when Byron became engaged, he took bets for and against the marriage taking place. </p> <p>As to Augusta, then, why did Byron love her so? Throughout their adult relationship she was either pregnant or looking after very young children. She was not interested in his poetry. When he suggested to her at the beginning of their affair (before his marriage, but not before hers) that she run away with him to the continent, she seemed eager, hesitated, then declined. This lack of passion may have played its part in the fascination she held for him; he felt that if there were scenes to be made, then it should be he who made them. </p> <p>The Bakewells stress her ability to make him laugh (she was an accomplished mimic); and laugh, above all, at himself. She made him reasonable by not taking his unreasonableness seriously, a trick his wife never discovered. When, during his honeymoon (which he gallantly termed his \"treaclemoon\"), Augusta heard that he had \"taken to stalking the long gallery in the middle of the night with his pistol and his dagger, threatening to kill himself\", she advised Annabella to ignore these \"grumps\". </p> <p>This seems to have been the key. Unable to pose, when alone with his half-sister Byron was forced to relax, to be natural and even pleasant. One of the great unanswerable questions of their histories is what would have happened if the two had gone away together in 1813. As it was, after the crisis of Byron's marriage and subsequent exile, Augusta was left at the mercy of a spendthrift husband she did not love and an embittered sister-in-law bent on revenge. Unsurprisingly, the rest of her life - as described here so fully by the Bakewells, who make it readable against the odds - was wretched.</p>",

Several explanations of this fact are possible, but it seems likely that practical disregard of the Pope's teaching on \"artificial\" methods of contraception has played a part. The limp arguments adduced in support of that doctrine may even have hardened Italian hearts against it. The voice of the Roman Catholic church in its homeland is, on this matter of sexual conduct, a shrill, small voice. </p> <p>Gays in the US by contrast, if The Silence of Sodom is to be believed, need to pay keener heed to the Pope because \"religious condemnation remains the most potent homophobic rhetoric\" and \"compelling cases can be made that identifying as a Catholic (or Christian) at this moment in American life can only be a form of collaboration with homosexuality's most dangerous enemies\". However many such cases \"can be made\", Mark D Jordan makes none of them, just as when he alleges that the Catholic church \"in a number of countries... represents the most powerful voice in favor of the repression and persecution of lesbians and gays\", he names no such country. Like many Catholics, Professor Jordan has a blessed naivety about political realities; he probably imagines the Swiss Guard possesses a terrifying strike power. </p> <p>A pervasive weakness of his book stems from his failure to distinguish what is specific to Catholicism, as distinct from Christianity or other religions and religion substitutes. The Pope holds no patent on fear and loathing. I once knew a Catalan Maoist who assured all who would listen that, as a result of the cultural revolution, only one homosexual remained in the People's Republic. Nor was it the Catholic church that subjected US homosexuals to electroconvulsive therapy; that was a bitter fruit of the Freudianism to which Jordan makes intermittent, unreflective appeals. </p> <p>It might rather be charged against current Catholic doctrine and practice that they lack any distinctively Catholic wisdom or compassion, as for instance in those dioceses and religious orders, running scared from scandal, that have handed over the assessment of vocations to psychiatrists and \"require extensive personality and psychological testing for their recruits... some have even resorted to penile response tests\" (Charles R Morris, American Catholic). This sits oddly with other official teaching - liberation theology is condemned for relying on Marxist tenets thought incompatible with Christianity, while at the same time the church capitulates to a science of the soul that aims to cure homosexuality along with other lamentable aberrations of the human creature, such as religious belief. </p> <p>Affliction, unlike fish, is not good for the brain, and abrasive years of conflicting loyalties as a gay Catholic have told on Jordan. He badly misstates some factual claims, as when he informs us that in the US \"everyone seems to agree that there are now more homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood and religious life than in the population at large\". Like many things everyone agrees on, this would be astounding if true, but he means only \"a higher proportion\" not \"more\". He doesn't bother to give statistics to back the allegation that \"sexually active gay clerics and ex-clerics seem so often to prefer the leather or S&amp;M 'subcultures' \". Some of the book is mere anecdotage: he met a gay bartender with a Sacred Heart of Jesus tattoo, from which he infers a kinship between homosexual and Catholic cultures. </p> <p>Much that he says is as little specific to homosexuality as it is to Catholicism. He condescends to young men by telling them they cannot \"truly appreciate what has already been done to [them] by the ambient homophobia\", though he might as well have written \"the ambient heterophilia\" or any other force of acculturation. \"Growing up Catholic\" may well be \"remembered as growing up in a kind of bondage\", but the same is true for many of growing up in Aylesbury. He stipulates that \"you have not felt the force of religious hate speech until you can condemn it angrily and in public precisely as hate speech\", which amounts to saying that your view doesn't count unless it coincides with his. He sounds in this respect quite like some Catholic bishops. </p> <p>Professor Jordan has my sympathy; it is hard to keep your temper and your wits when contemplating some pronouncements of the Catholic hierarchy, for instance the repulsive slur in the 1975 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's declaration on sexual ethics, that remarked on homosexuals' \"inability to fit into society\". It is not as a homosexual but as a Catholic that I find this objectionable; it betrays not only ignorance about the reality of homosexuals' lives but, worse, a sell-out of the gospel to the kingdom of this world, a rendering unto Caesar of things which are not his. It is not the church's business to assist in the manufacture of individuals who \"fit into\" society; her mission is to strive towards a society fit for the flourishing of the individuals whom God created. The church hierarchy has many times connived with coarse ethical majoritarianism; homosexuals have not been the only, or even the principal, victims of such connivance. </p> <p>Many gays hate Christianity, perhaps especially Catholicism. This is unsurprising; as Auden said, \"Those to whom evil is done/ Do evil in return\". Yet history does not support what John Boswell in his pioneering book, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality , called \"the common idea that religious belief - Christian or other - has been the cause of intolerance in regard to gay people\". Gays who wish to do more than shore up their own preferred bigotry would do better to read Boswell than Jordan. And Catholics who are not wholly sated with the spurious certainties palmed off on them in place of the Gospel challenge will learn more from Gareth Moore's splendidly considered The Body in Context: Sex and Catholicism , which has the advantage of not isolating homosexuality from other questions in Christian sexual ethics. </p> <p>Each group, and particularly anyone who belongs to them both, needs constant reminding that Christian teaching can be taught only by Christ-like means. He said \"in my Father's house are many mansions\", from which it probably follows that the house has many approach roads too.

The author of this biography, Darden Asbury Pyron, admits they were lies.

He reeked with the kind of emetic language that can only make grown men long for a quiet corner, an aspidistra, a handkerchief and the old heave-ho. </p> <p>Slobbering over his mother, winking at his brother and counting the cash every second, this superb piece of candyfloss had an answer for every situation. Nobody has purveyed a bigger slagheap of lilac-covered hokum. And nobody has ever made so much money out of high-speed piano playing, with the ghost of Chopin gibbering at every note. There must have been something wrong with us, that our teenagers longing for sex and our middle-aged matrons fed up with sex should have fallen for such a sugary mountain of jingling claptrap. </p> <p>The biography reports the so-called \"affair\" with Joanne Rio that appeared to be not an affair at all - rather an attempt to overcome the reports of homosexuality. Liberace also dated Sonja Henie and Mae West, both gay men's icons. Scott Thorson, Liberace's live-in lover for six years, later sued for palimony, the first suit of its kind. His own lawyers advised against taking the case to court, and eventually he dropped the suit. </p> <p>Then of course there are the trimmings, all of which are listed here: the outrageous costumes, the piano-shaped swimming pool, the grin that seemed riveted to his face. In the 20-odd photos, the perpetual grin is in 18 of them. </p> <p>It could have been different. Pyron states that the young Liberace was influenced by the Polish pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski. At one point the young boy played for Paderewski, who was quoted as saying \"some day this young man will take my place\". There were some similarities in our careers - I, too, was influenced by Paderewski, and was expelled from music college for playing his early hit Yes, We Have No Bananas at a graduation ceremony.

Jaroslav Hasek's picaresque novel, The Good Soldier Svejk (1923), is a national favourite: its garrulous prose and carnivalesque laughter are characteristic of a Bohemian literature that could seldom dare to be overtly political. Following the ludicrous yet effective antics of its anti-hero Svejk, an idiot savant in the Austro-Hungarian army, the novel takes on the church, the state and the army with a bumbling fury. The result is a Czech Don Quixote, blissfully excessive and strangely pertinent. </p> <p>Bohumil Hrabal carried on this mischievous spirit of defiance as Czech literature remained underground and forged its own democracy. Closely Observed Trains (1965) is set at the end of the war and Too Loud a Solitude (1980) during Communist oppression. Both are slim classics that read as if written while running down a hill; they recover humour and humanity from difficult times. </p> <p>Perhaps the best introduction to Hrabal's work is I Served the King of England (1980), which depicts the bizarre life of a bellboy at the Golden Prague Hotel on the eve of the second world war. There is sadness here and an implicit feeling of loss, yet such is the felicity of Hrabal's prose that his reflectiveness merely preludes more astonishing touches of wisdom and beauty. And the city of Prague is magically invoked throughout. </p> <p>Josef Skvorecky's fervent anti-communism led him to emigrate to Canada following the 1968 invasion. The Engineer of Human Souls (1977) is his magnum opus, but a more accessible read is Talkin' Moscow Blues , which brings together his lively and deeply ironic essays on politics, literature, jazz and his wartime childhood. </p> <p>Kafka aside, Milan Kundera is the Czech Republic's best-known writer (although he now lives in Paris and writes in French), and it's hard to beat The Unbearable Lightness of Being for a dramatisation of the spring of 1968. Sardonic and philosophical, Kundera is an astute observer of human behaviour and, like the best Czech writers, effortlessly combines sexual and national politics. </p> <p>The same can be said for Ivan Kl\u00edma. A survivor of the Terezin camp, Kl\u00edma's work explores love and freedom with insight, compassion and wit. The narrator of Love and Garbage (1968) gives up his thesis on Kafka to become a road-sweeper, using his free thinking time to muse on the nature of love and liberty and the demands of being a writer. Both poignant and funny, this is an extraordinary novel. The Spirit of Prague, a collection of Klima's essays and articles, is also worth investigating, while Jan Neruda's Prague Tales (1877) remains a classic for its vignettes of life in the Mal\u00e1 Strana at the end of the 19th century. </p> <p>Among the younger generation of writers, Michael Viewegh is very popular. As their titles suggest, The Wonderful Years of Lousy Living (1992) and Bringing up Girls in Bohemia (1994) are irreverent social satires that playfully deconstruct the freedoms enjoyed since 1989. They're also very funny. Viewegh is included in a valuable anthology of new Czech fiction, Daylight in Nightclub Inferno (1997), which also offers pieces from Ewald Murrer, Daniela Hodrov\u00e1, Alexandra Berkov\u00e1 and - perhaps the most promising - J\u00edri Kratochvil. </p> <p>Once described by Ted Hughes as \"one of the half dozen most important poets living anywhere\", Miroslav Holub is a poet-scientist whose pieces read as if each word has been persuaded into place by a delicate fingertip. Poems Before and After (1990) gathers work written either side of the Soviet invasion, while The Rampage (1997) is his most recent collection. </p> <p>\u0095 To order any of these titles, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

As their titles suggest, The Wonderful Years of Lousy Living (1992) and Bringing up Girls in Bohemia (1994) are irreverent social satires that playfully deconstruct the freedoms enjoyed since 1989. They're also very funny. Viewegh is included in a valuable anthology of new Czech fiction, Daylight in Nightclub Inferno (1997), which also offers pieces from Ewald Murrer, Daniela Hodrov\u00e1, Alexandra Berkov\u00e1 and - perhaps the most promising - J\u00edri Kratochvil. Once described by Ted Hughes as \"one of the half dozen most important poets living anywhere\", Miroslav Holub is a poet-scientist whose pieces read as if each word has been persuaded into place by a delicate fingertip. Poems Before and After (1990) gathers work written either side of the Soviet invasion, while The Rampage (1997) is his most recent collection. \u0095 To order any of these titles, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

      "body": "<p><strong> On Men: Masculinity in Crisis</strong> by Anthony Clare <br>262pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, <strong>\u00a317.99 </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501024886.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> The healing of the mind through love is what religion and psychiatry both aspire to. Though the elaborate, uneasy ruminations of Professor Anthony Clare's On Men: Masculinity in Crisis are couched in the secular language of the consulting room, the book's basic direction is moral, almost evangelical. It's an appeal for calm in an apocalyptic world; polemic arguing for an end to polemic, or at least to a long era of sexual terrorism and intractable self-interest between men and women. </p> <p>Clare has always been a conciliator and a populist. Temperamentally, he seems genuinely reluctant to offend, unwilling to browbeat or assert without being completely secure in his facts - the book's admirable opening sentence, \"As I get older and perhaps wiser, I realise more and more what I do not know\", is very characteristic. The emollient intimacies of his long-running series In the Psychiatrist's Chair have been perfect for Radio 4, bridging the gap between the easygoing celebrity interview and something much less flirtatious and more unsettling. </p> <p>To his detractors, there's something a bit Delia Smith about Clare - a bit limelight-hungry and ingratiating. His gift is to be exquisitely sympathetic, fluently thoughtful, not confrontational or revelatory or profound. What he does makes excellent and often compulsive listening, but it's a long way from the disturbing, strenuous, driven, ground-breaking, quasi-medicine-cum-quasi-magic of the great psychiatric thinkers such as Freud, Jung, Adler or Klein. </p> <p>That there's a tougher, more thoroughgoing and aggressive wisdom underpinning Clare's philosophy is obvious almost at once on reading On Men . Clare describes a mood of apparently deepening sexual mistrust, in which women are enjoying a process of political and biological emancipation. Meanwhile men, emasculated by the science that allows women to conceive children without them, find themselves increasingly attacked, marginalised and psychically wounded. Yet the crisis the book talks of isn't really one of masculinity but one of faith, or lack of it. Ultimately, as Clare sees it, the problem for the world isn't old-fashioned phallic masculinity or the consequences of male violence, arrogance and intimidation, but something simpler and deeper and which crosses the sexual barrier - hatred itself. </p> <p>It's this informing perception that lifts his theme above fashionable panic. Much of Clare's knottily detailed analysis - with its careful deployment of statistics, its sense of tiptoeing across a minefield - is an attempt to prove, in the face of what he regards as an inherently threatening gender-politicised feminist climate, that certain fairly basic, commonsensical things are really true. That divorce isn't necessarily the best solution for couples at loggerheads, as one-parent apologists have claimed; that children from divorced families tend not to perform as well educationally or emotionally; that the now fashionably redundant father is better present than absent; and that there's an innate psychodynamic weakness in the single-parent family that makes it an unreliable ideal. </p> <p>Above all, Clare genuinely hates the hatreds that too often pollute the whole troubled area. Behind his book lies the keen, wounded perception that the conflicts of gender politics - the entrenched, impacted animosities which pile up on both sides - are something essentially destructive. These hatreds, whether rooted in gender, sexual orientation or ideological cause, are little more than psychological strategies to allow groups of people to feel for the \"enemy\" group a contempt or loathing of which they would be morally ashamed if they applied it to themselves or their associates. </p> <p>Seeking an accommodation, a healing therapy of mutual respect capable of resolving these long-entrenched divisions, he argues powerfully against the purely chemical or biological determinism that holds that men are the helpless, testosterone-fuelled prisoners of their genes. Instead, he returns masculinity to its source in the family - to love, mutual respect and the primary creative role that both sexes undertake in the rearing of children. </p> <p>To some extent the book is a development of Dr Ian Suttie's controversial and progressive 1935 classic, The Origins of Love and Hate , published in the period between the Suffragettes and the Pill when modern radicalism was founded. The book took much of the authoritarian and patriarchal sexual psychopathology out of Freud's theories of individual emotional development, reinterpreting the mother-child relation ship in terms less sternly repressive, and less pessimistic and cynical, than Freud had done. </p> <p>Suttie thought that the child's primary need was for love, not the gratification of sensory appetite, and that culture and art (which, to Freud, arose from the suppression of the sexual instinct) grew out of the games children play in order to make the transition from mother-dependency to being well integrated and thus successfully separated social beings. To Suttie, the emotional and cultural world we make as adults is a substitute for (and therefore a mirror of) the mother-child relationship. That was our first experience not merely of sensual comfort and fulfilment, but of other more complicated emotional needs - for \"company, moral encouragement, attention, protectiveness, leadership\". He believed society could achieve psychic health only by becoming more matriarchal. In a memorable phrase that still deserves wider currency, he wanted \"the taboo on tenderness\" lifted from men, male rearing and education. So, too, does Clare. </p> <p>One of the attractive features of On Men is how little actual psychiatry it contains. Clare prefers to deal with the sociological implications of masculine behaviour rather than playing guru and claiming some spurious dogmatic pseudo-knowledge of how it originates in the mind. The part-science and part-shamanism of psychiatric thinking has always had its wilfully blind side. Just as in a religious age the workings of chance and organic illness were ascribed to the will of God, so the psychotherapeutic creeds of the last 100 years - which distrust the purely accidental as much as the conventionally religious used to do - make the mind or the psyche conjecturally responsible for everything that the body feels or is obliged to sustain. </p> <p>We live, as a result, in a stubbornly psychosomatic era, seeing in all our malaise and misfortune some rectifiable dysfunction of our individual selves. Yet, as Clare slowly but relentlessly establishes, part of our trouble is that we look inward too complacently, ignoring too easily the collective cultural conditions that lie mostly beyond the scope of personal therapy. </p> <p>\"We spend money on killing machines and wonder why our youngsters are so aggressive. We insist our children, from the earliest years, familiarise themselves with the intricacies of human biology, yet ensure they learn little or nothing of psychology until their own personalities are distorted beyond correction. And, rather than acknowledge the neglect we have shown towards structures such as marriage and family life, we resort to undermining their importance in the sum of human health and happiness.\" There's a salutary anger in this, as well as a loathing of dogma and a fine, sane, bristling common sense.</p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of On Men: Masculinity in Crisis at the discount price of \u00a314.99, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166102.</p>",

He wrote it in 1853, shortly before he lost his lifelong battle with depression, later claiming in his delusions that the slow movement had been dictated by angels. After his death, his widow, Clara, deemed it inferior to the rest of his music and the manuscript languished in a vault in Berlin until 1933, when it was unearthed by the extraordinarily named violinist Jelly D'Aranyi. She made the equally remarkable claim that Schumann had appeared to her during a s\u00e9ance and told her to give the world premiere. </p> <p>Since then, opinions about the piece have differed sharply. But Christian Tetzlaff brought it to the Proms as part of an impressive concert with the Bremen Kammerphilharmonie and its new music director, Daniel Harding. It doesn't warrant Clara's dismissal, though it does prove a strange piece, oddly prefiguring Schumann's mental collapse. </p> <p>Moments of majestic assertion give way to profound unease as themes splinter and fray. The serenity of the \"angelic\" slow movement is undercut by lurching arpeggios. The ending is shocking: after the orchestra has reached its final static chord, the violinist carries on playing, his line fad ing out as if defeated. It's also extremely difficult, full of endless, tricky double and triple stopping. Tetzlaff takes a while to get going, not striking form until partway through the first movement, though imposing and eloquent thereafter. </p> <p>The performance of Schumann's Third Symphony was strong on energy, exuberance and bucolic humour, less so on majestic grandeur - which it really needs as well, particularly in its slow movement, which was slightly hectored here. Harding's fussy, over- emphatic way with music is, it would seem, relaxing a bit. His mannered fondness for extremes of tempo and dynamics was much in evidence in the performance of Beethoven's Leonore No 2 Overture, which opened the concert, though thereafter he calmed down. He remains extravagant of gesture, however, and excitable on the platform: towards the end of the Schumann symphony, he accidentally let go of his baton, which went flying into the first violins.</p>",

She made the equally remarkable claim that Schumann had appeared to her during a s\u00e9ance and told her to give the world premiere. Since then, opinions about the piece have differed sharply. But Christian Tetzlaff brought it to the Proms as part of an impressive concert with the Bremen Kammerphilharmonie and its new music director, Daniel Harding. It doesn't warrant Clara's dismissal, though it does prove a strange piece, oddly prefiguring Schumann's mental collapse. Moments of majestic assertion give way to profound unease as themes splinter and fray. The serenity of the \"angelic\" slow movement is undercut by lurching arpeggios. The ending is shocking: after the orchestra has reached its final static chord, the violinist carries on playing, his line fad ing out as if defeated. It's also extremely difficult, full of endless, tricky double and triple stopping. Tetzlaff takes a while to get going, not striking form until partway through the first movement, though imposing and eloquent thereafter. The performance of Schumann's Third Symphony was strong on energy, exuberance and bucolic humour, less so on majestic grandeur - which it really needs as well, particularly in its slow movement, which was slightly hectored here. Harding's fussy, over- emphatic way with music is, it would seem, relaxing a bit. His mannered fondness for extremes of tempo and dynamics was much in evidence in the performance of Beethoven's Leonore No 2 Overture, which opened the concert, though thereafter he calmed down. He remains extravagant of gesture, however, and excitable on the platform: towards the end of the Schumann symphony, he accidentally let go of his baton, which went flying into the first violins.",

      "body": "<p>If you spot this man walking down your street looking for an address, start getting very, very jealous. He's probably headed for the house with the champagne bottles strewn outside. </p> <p>Jim Burke is the man from Coutts - the bank to the rich and famous, including the Queen - who advises the big lottery jackpot winners what to do with their cash. On Saturday and Wednesday evenings he switches his mobile on and waits for the call. Every now and then he has to turn up with hard cash, pronto. </p> <p>\"A lot of the winners just want to see what it looks like. They want us to lay it out on the table so they can feel it.\" Then he winks at you: \"We always use small denomination notes. It looks like a lot more.\" </p> <p>One winner asked Coutts if it could measure up his house; he wanted to know if his jackpot winnings would fill every space in it. \"It would have just about worked. Fortunately it was only a two-bed bungalow,\" he says. </p> <p>Not that Mr Burke wanders around the country with a suitcase full of dosh; the hard cash only hits the table at Camelot offices, with plenty of security guards at hand. </p> <p>In the days immediately after a big jackpot, he visits the winner at their home. But the last thing he wants to look like is a pin-striped City banker. Usually he sets out in tee-shirt and jeans. \"In some of the places we go to, the only people who wear suits are debt collectors. One of the flats I visited had a metal door with bars at the window and a burnt-out car outside. I was glad I had parked my car some way away. </p> <p>\"Some don't even want their husband or wife to know they've won. We had one winner who disappeared for three months in disguise,\" he says. </p> <p>Coutts doesn't automatically have the right to handle jackpot winners' finances. The winners first talk to a Camelot adviser, who sets out their options. Banking arrangements have to be sorted out immediately as Camelot won't pay out all the money in cash. Professional advisers - solicitors to deal with wills and accountants to minimise tax - come later. </p> <p>Coutts often has the edge because of its most famous customer, the Queen, with all the security and confidentiality that implies. Mr Burke is adviser to around a third of the 1,000 individual jackpot millionaires created since the lottery started in 1994. </p> <p>The winners don't want to be talked down to, don't want endless financial jargon, and certainly don't want to see a spivvy life insurance salesman, says Mr Burke. Once they have selected their adviser, the relationship can become intensely close; the adviser is often the only one who knows the truth about exactly how much is being spent, how it is being shared out and who gets what. </p> <p>\"We know what they know, and there has to be absolute trust.\" </p> <p>Accepting gifts, cash or otherwise, from winners is banned under Coutts rules. So how does he guide the winners in spending their cash? </p> <p> <strong> 1. Instant cash</strong> </p> <p> The first thing is to supply an immediate cash float to winners. This typically ranges from \u00a32,000 to \u00a35,000, so, for example, winners have no problems buying rounds down the local pub. One winner spent around \u00a330,000 straight away on a holiday, but as Mr Burke says: \"It amounted to no more than three or four weeks' interest on their winnings.\" </p> <p>Others spend nothing for some time. \"Some appear to be paralysed by the win and can't take any decisions,\" he says. </p> <p>Cash from a jackpot win is normally cleared through a winner's bank account within a few days. A Saturday win can be cleared by the Monday. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Clearing debts</strong> </p> <p> The next step is to eliminate all existing debt. Mortgages, credit cards and personal loans are paid off as soon as possible. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Gifts to family and friends</strong> </p> <p> Contrary to reports that lottery winners are mean with their cash, the reverse is true. In Mr Burke's experience, around 35-50% of a jackpot is given away. One of his recent clients gave \u00a31m to each of their children - which means that the children often also sign up as clients of Coutts. He also knows of one winner, who never sought any publicity, who gave their entire \u00a31m win to charity. </p> <p> <strong> 4. New car/new house</strong> </p> <p> The notoriety of \"spend, spend, spend\" pools winner Viv Nicholson has cautioned jackpot winners against splurging on Ferraris or Rolls-Royces, neither of which appear in the top 10 cars bought by the new millionaires. According to Mr Burke, jackpot winners tend to spend about \u00a3500,000 on a new home. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Investments</strong> </p> <p> The style of investing depends on the winner's age.

      "bodyText": "If you spot this man walking down your street looking for an address, start getting very, very jealous. He's probably headed for the house with the champagne bottles strewn outside. Jim Burke is the man from Coutts - the bank to the rich and famous, including the Queen - who advises the big lottery jackpot winners what to do with their cash. On Saturday and Wednesday evenings he switches his mobile on and waits for the call. Every now and then he has to turn up with hard cash, pronto. \"A lot of the winners just want to see what it looks like. They want us to lay it out on the table so they can feel it.\" Then he winks at you: \"We always use small denomination notes. It looks like a lot more.\" One winner asked Coutts if it could measure up his house; he wanted to know if his jackpot winnings would fill every space in it. \"It would have just about worked. Fortunately it was only a two-bed bungalow,\" he says. Not that Mr Burke wanders around the country with a suitcase full of dosh; the hard cash only hits the table at Camelot offices, with plenty of security guards at hand. In the days immediately after a big jackpot, he visits the winner at their home. But the last thing he wants to look like is a pin-striped City banker. Usually he sets out in tee-shirt and jeans. \"In some of the places we go to, the only people who wear suits are debt collectors. One of the flats I visited had a metal door with bars at the window and a burnt-out car outside. I was glad I had parked my car some way away. \"Some don't even want their husband or wife to know they've won. We had one winner who disappeared for three months in disguise,\" he says. Coutts doesn't automatically have the right to handle jackpot winners' finances. The winners first talk to a Camelot adviser, who sets out their options. Banking arrangements have to be sorted out immediately as Camelot won't pay out all the money in cash. Professional advisers - solicitors to deal with wills and accountants to minimise tax - come later. Coutts often has the edge because of its most famous customer, the Queen, with all the security and confidentiality that implies. Mr Burke is adviser to around a third of the 1,000 individual jackpot millionaires created since the lottery started in 1994. The winners don't want to be talked down to, don't want endless financial jargon, and certainly don't want to see a spivvy life insurance salesman, says Mr Burke. Once they have selected their adviser, the relationship can become intensely close; the adviser is often the only one who knows the truth about exactly how much is being spent, how it is being shared out and who gets what. \"We know what they know, and there has to be absolute trust.\" Accepting gifts, cash or otherwise, from winners is banned under Coutts rules. So how does he guide the winners in spending their cash? 1. Instant cash The first thing is to supply an immediate cash float to winners. This typically ranges from \u00a32,000 to \u00a35,000, so, for example, winners have no problems buying rounds down the local pub. One winner spent around \u00a330,000 straight away on a holiday, but as Mr Burke says: \"It amounted to no more than three or four weeks' interest on their winnings.\" Others spend nothing for some time. \"Some appear to be paralysed by the win and can't take any decisions,\" he says. Cash from a jackpot win is normally cleared through a winner's bank account within a few days. A Saturday win can be cleared by the Monday. 2. Clearing debts The next step is to eliminate all existing debt. Mortgages, credit cards and personal loans are paid off as soon as possible. 3. Gifts to family and friends Contrary to reports that lottery winners are mean with their cash, the reverse is true. In Mr Burke's experience, around 35-50% of a jackpot is given away. One of his recent clients gave \u00a31m to each of their children - which means that the children often also sign up as clients of Coutts. He also knows of one winner, who never sought any publicity, who gave their entire \u00a31m win to charity. 4. New car/new house The notoriety of \"spend, spend, spend\" pools winner Viv Nicholson has cautioned jackpot winners against splurging on Ferraris or Rolls-Royces, neither of which appear in the top 10 cars bought by the new millionaires. According to Mr Burke, jackpot winners tend to spend about \u00a3500,000 on a new home. 5. Investments The style of investing depends on the winner's age. A young winner needs the capital to grow for the future, a pensioner does not. Coutts is a big user of hedge funds to maximise growth and reduce risk, and for its lottery winners has earned around 15-25% a year on their investments. It suggests that young winners should take as income around 5-10% of their winnings per year. Contrary to popular mythology, hardly anybody carries on working or remains in their family home, says Mr Burke. \"Some delay the decision for a while, but most give up work.\" Does Mr Burke ever feel jealous ? He admits to a tinge of envy, and says he buys five lottery tickets each week. Would he quit his job if he won? \"I admit I probably would.\" Lottery factfile The prizes \u0095 Total number of lottery millionaires created: 1,016. \u0095 The average size of a jackpot ticket is \u00a31,996,710. \u0095Highest ever jackpot was \u00a342,008,610 on January 6, 1996, shared between three winners. The buyers \u0095 Around 65% of the population buy a lottery ticket regularly. The average spend is \u00a33.34. \u0095 20% of ticket buyers are in social class AB, 28% are in social class DE. The sellers \u0095 The average corner shop selling lottery tickets picks up annual commission of \u00a38,187. \u0095The shops earn 5% of the ticket sales plus 1% commission on prizes of \u00a310-\u00a3200. \u0095Typical sales per shop are \u00a33,149 per week. The winners \u0095 Paul Maddison and Mark Gardiner from Hastings scooped the largest jackpot; \u00a322,590,829 on June 10, 1995. \u0095 The oldest jackpot winner is William Sullivan, 81, who picked up \u00a3555,556 on Dec 12, 1997. \u0095The youngest winner is Tracey Makin, 17, who collected \u00a31,055,171 on January 24, 1998. \u0095 The luckiest star signs for jackpot winners are Cancer, followed by Gemini and Taurus. \u0095 The luckiest county for jackpot winners is Essex, followed by Lancashire and Cheshire.

      "body": "<p>CATs have made their mark on Isas and mortgages and now they're about to get their claws into credit cards. The government wants to make it easier for the nation's 23 million credit card-holders to know exactly what they're being charged, and to give those hunting for a new card a better idea of which ones offer a decent deal. </p> <p>To this end, it is bringing in so-called CAT marks on credit cards. In order to be able to display the mark, a card will have to have user-friendly terms, with no nasty surprises hidden away in the small print. </p> <p>CAT marks (the \"CAT\" stands for Charges, Access and Terms) came in for Isas last year and for home loans in April, and the government is so enamoured with the concept it now wants to extend it to other financial products. The aim is to encourage card companies to provide better, clearer information so people know exactly what they have to pay and can shop around for the best card for them. Ministers could also insist that card providers put limits on some charges they impose, and do away with others altogether. </p> <p>The Treasury is concerned that while there are a lot of attractive headline rates around, some may not realise these often last only a few months or only apply to balance transfers. However, it hasn't decided what the CAT marks will look like - it will be consulting over the next few months, with a final decision expected in the spring. </p> <p>This week Jobs and Money canvassed the view of some of the industry's experts as to what changes we might see. </p> <p>Some people might wonder why the government has chosen to home in on credit cards, bearing in mind that intense competition between the growing number of providers has resulted in the lowest rates ever seen in the UK. Introductory annual percentage rates (APRs) have plunged as low as 3.5. But below the glittering headline rates there often lurk hidden nasties - like stiff penalties for late payment or exceeding your credit limit. </p> <p>And while there are undoubtedly some cracking rates on offer, mainly from new providers, many of the biggies such as Barclaycard and NatWest have standard interest rates of 19-20 APR - more than three times the current bank base rate (6%). </p> <p>So what are some of the areas where the government could act? </p> <p> <strong> Small print fees such as late payment charges and penalties for going over your credit limit.</strong> </p> <p> The government may well want to set limits on the charges that can be imposed. Credit cards tend to fall into two different camps, says Liz Chettleburgh at financial data specialists Moneyfacts. Some cards don't offer the lowest rates on the market, but also don't impose any small print fees, while others offer an attractive rate but charge a variety of fees. Late payment charges are one of the most common types of penalty, and an example of a card that falls into this camp is RBS Advanta, which has an introductory APR of just 4.5 until March 1 2001 but a \u00a312 late payment fee, and charges the same amount if you exceed your credit limit. NatWest also charges \u00a312 for late payment and \u00a315 for going over your limit; Lloyds TSB charges \u00a315 for both. </p> <p>One of the providers that charges the most is Egg, which makes you shell out a hefty \u00a320 every time you pay late or if you go over your limit. But then you have to balance that against that fact that Egg's card has a very good rate (10.9 APR for purchases, and just 2.5 APR on balance transfers for the first six months) plus it offers you 1% cashback - 2% if you use the card in the \"Egg shopping zone\" of online retailers. </p> <p> <strong> Withdrawing money from cash machines using your card</strong> . </p> <p> Ms Chettleburgh says the government might want to put a cap on this fee. Almost every card company imposes a charge, typically 1.5% of the amount withdrawn, with a minimum charge of around \u00a31.50. Lombard Direct is one of the very few providers that doesn't charge for this. </p> <p> <strong> Administration charges for foreign usage.</strong> </p> <p> This is typically 2.75% of the transaction value, so if you spend \u00a3100 with your card on holiday, the card company might charge you \u00a32.75. Only a handful of issuers don't make a charge - Nationwide is one. And one or two will impose a lower charge if the transaction takes place in an EU country. Again, ministers may want to put a ceiling on the maximum that can be charged. </p> <p> <strong> Other fees and costs.</strong> </p> <p> Many companies charge for sending out a duplicate statement - with NatWest the fee is \u00a35. You may find other fees lurking in the small print too. Lloyds TSB scrapped its annual fee last year but instead has a \u00a310 \"low usage\" charge if you use your card less than 10 times in a year and incur no interest in the same year. </p> <p> <strong> How the interest is charged.</strong> </p> <p> Ministers may well want to standardize this. Many card providers charge interest from the date the item is charged to the account, but a few, such as NatWest and Nationwide, charge from the date the goods are purchased. Charging interest from the date the item is bought in effect means the meter starts running as soon as you plonk your plastic down on the shop counter. </p> <p> <strong> Putting a maximum limit on the interest that can be charged.</strong> </p> <p> One would assume this would be high on the government's agenda, but some experts question whether the government is likely to meddle with rates. Kathy Lewis at the Credit Card Research Group, which represents all the major card issuers, says there is \"an awful lot of competition out there\". Average APRs have fallen substantially and are 25% lower than four years ago, with even lower introductory rates, she adds. </p> <p> <strong> Annual fees.</strong> </p> <p> These have almost completely disappeared in the last few years. Only a small handful of providers now impose an annual fee, including American Express Blue (\u00a312) and Clydesdale Bank (\u00a310). Barclaycard has one, but won't charge it for the first year and will waive it thereafter if you spend a minimum amount on your card. </p> <p> <strong> The interest-free period.</strong> </p> <p> Most cards offer up to 59 days' interest-free credit, though with a few it's less than this or nothing at all. </p> <p>The Treasury says that \"price transparency\" is likely to be at the heart of whatever it does. It wants to force credit card terms and conditions out into the open so consumers don't get \"sucked in\" on the basis of unclear information. </p> <p>One of the other things it is likely to look at is how changes to interest rates are communicated to customers. It may want to lay down requirements about how people are informed about changes and may also decide there should be more of a link between the movement of the bank base rate and credit card rates. </p> <p>The government is bringing in CAT standards in response to the Cruickshank review of high street banks published in March, which set out dozens of recommendations on giving customers a better deal. Don Cruickshank, head of the review team, believes credit card statements, in particular, are not nearly clear enough. </p> <p>Kathy Lewis says the industry will welcome anything that improves information, provided it does not lead to consumers being even more confused. </p> <p><strong>A user's guide to getting the best from your plastic</strong></p> <p>If you're looking for a new card and don't usually pay off your balance at the end of each month, your priority should be a low interest rate. </p> <p>Cards offering a very low introductory rate for purchases include Nationwide building society (3.5 APR for the first six months, then 14.6 APR), Capital One Bank (3.9 APR for the first six months, then 12.9 APR), RBS Advanta (4.5 APR until March 1 2001, then 17.9 APR), Marbles (4.5 APR for six months, then 14.9 APR) and Hamilton Direct Bank (4.9 APR for six months, then 11.9 APR). </p> <p>However, if you don't fancy switching again once the special offer rate ends, you may be better off going for a low-ish standard rate that doesn't disappear after a few months. Northern Rock offers a card with a standard rate of 10.5 APR, while Egg and firstdirect.com both charge 10.9 APR. </p> <p>If you pay off your bill in full each month, thereby avoiding interest charges, look at the perks on offer. Cashback, air miles and donations to charity are all popular. Aside from Egg (see main story), other cards that offer cashback are Alliance &amp; Leicester MoneyBack card, American Express Blue and the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter card. Alliance &amp; Leicester this week announced it will be offering double money back to the end of the year for all new customers joining between August 14 and October 14. They will earn 1% when they spend up to \u00a34,000 on a card and 2% on further spending up to \u00a320,000. </p> <p>Intelligent Finance (IF), the Halifax's new internet and telephone bank whose launch has been delayed until later this month says it will be offering people the opportunity to pay no interest on credit card borrowings. It will operate a system whereby it connects up products such as current accounts and credit cards, giving people the chance to offset savings against borrowings. </p> <p>If you have more money in your IF current account than debt on your IF credit card, you can offset one against the other and enjoy a zero-interest credit card. IF's standard card rate will be 10.8 APR. </p> <p>Some credit cards offer special deals with other companies. Lloyds TSB offers deals on British Midland flights, First Call holidays, Hertz car hire, Hoverspeed and Thistle Hotels. Many cards offer free travel accident insurance - typically up to \u00a350,000. NatWest says this doesn't just cover you when you go on holiday; it also means that if you buy your rail or bus season ticket with your card, you are covered. </p>",

They will earn 1% when they spend up to \u00a34,000 on a card and 2% on further spending up to \u00a320,000. Intelligent Finance (IF), the Halifax's new internet and telephone bank whose launch has been delayed until later this month says it will be offering people the opportunity to pay no interest on credit card borrowings. It will operate a system whereby it connects up products such as current accounts and credit cards, giving people the chance to offset savings against borrowings. If you have more money in your IF current account than debt on your IF credit card, you can offset one against the other and enjoy a zero-interest credit card. IF's standard card rate will be 10.8 APR. Some credit cards offer special deals with other companies. Lloyds TSB offers deals on British Midland flights, First Call holidays, Hertz car hire, Hoverspeed and Thistle Hotels. Many cards offer free travel accident insurance - typically up to \u00a350,000. NatWest says this doesn't just cover you when you go on holiday; it also means that if you buy your rail or bus season ticket with your card, you are covered.",

Having landed a job in a grungy Chicago club, he is picked up by rich-bitch Mrs Vera Simpson, toy-boyishly indulged and given the boot when the blackmailers move in. It is, in short, a musical about real, ambivalent people: Joey is a likable louse, while the 40ish Mrs Simpson has both the sexual voracity of the neglected wife and a cool mercilessness when her public reputation is endangered. </p> <p>The intimate setting also allows you to savour Lorenz Hart's lyrics, which have rhymes that snap and bite like an alligator's jaws. Zip, the most famous number, satirising a stripper's intellectual pretensions, is actually an irrelevance. Clare Burt here sings it well but is never heard from again. Far better is Hart's ability to write lyrics that uniquely combine passion and wit. In Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, Vera cries: \"I'll sing to him/Each spring to him/And worship the trousers that cling to him\", reminding you that her real interests lie below the belt. Hart's night-owl sophistication offsets Rodgers' melodic romanticism in a way that Hammerstein's plangent folksiness rarely did. </p> <p>But much of the charm of Ingram's production comes from the choreography of Craig Revel Horwood, which is witty, character-driven and the cloak for some wonderful scenic transitions. The nightclub routines themselves have a parodic, rump-brandishing sexi ness. Even more erotic is a duo for Vera and Joey - Den of Iniquity - in which she straddles him before they curl up together in an angora rug. </p> <p>Susannah Fellows's Vera has just the right mix of social poise and sexual hunger, and Martin Crewes - unlike Sinatra in the movie version - is a youthful opportunist rather than an ageing rou\u00e9. There is also priceless support from Michelle Hodgson, who plays a bored showgirl with leggy lassitude, and from Wayne Cater, who shines especially as a fairy-footed choreographer in a saucy beret.

There is also priceless support from Michelle Hodgson, who plays a bored showgirl with leggy lassitude, and from Wayne Cater, who shines especially as a fairy-footed choreographer in a saucy beret. It all adds up to an evening of untrammelled delight. \u0095 Until September 2. Box office: 01243 781312 .",

      "body": "<p>Inundated with adverts and publicity material for internet property portals, all of which seem to hold claims to providing \"the best/leading/ most comprehensive\" service, Jobs &amp; Money decided to test what the web really has to offer would-be home buyers. </p> <p>Armed with a random list of property websites, we set ourselves the task of finding potential properties for two sets of home movers within a four hour slot on the internet. </p> <p>The results below show that two sites, <a href=\"http://www.assertahomes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">assertahomes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fish4homes.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">fish4homes</a>, found a wide range of properties within our critieria, but other sites (one could not locate a house in Greater London) were barely worth the time searching. </p> <p> <strong> Couple A </strong> with two young children are relocating from London to Leeds for job purposes and are looking for a family home with at least three bedrooms with a top price of around \u00a3125,000. They don't know the region and are hoping that surfing the net will not only give them access to appropriate properties for sale, but also give them a feel for the city's different areas, helping them choose exactly where to live. </p> <p> <strong> Couple B </strong> young, childless, career people want to move from south London to Wanstead in east London which will be both close to the countryside with Epping Forest on its doorstep, yet give them swift transport links to both his job in the City of London and her new job at Stansted airport. They have little idea of property prices, however, and are hoping their maximum budget of \u00a3150,000 will buy them a smart, two-bedroom flat. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.08004homes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.08004homes.com</a> </p> <p> This multifunctional property site, which includes a mortgage calculator and a useful bank of advice features on aspects like buying, selling, mortgages and moving, looked promising with its claim to holding details of over 96,000 properties for sale in the UK. But the search mech- anism proved disappointing. </p> <p>I couldn't specify 'Leeds' as an area for Couple A. The choice was between looking at properties in the whole of West Yorkshire - an unwieldy proposition at well over 100, or those in specific villages and towns in the county though Leeds itself was not listed. Though usefully detailed for natives, this latter option is virtually useless for anyone moving into an unfamiliar region. Also, in common with several other property sites, when asked to specify your upper price limit the choice was in \u00a350,000 bands. So, I decided to keep Couple A's options open by plumping for \u00a3150,000 from now on rather than \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>For couple B, the narrowest area parameter I could enter was east London which gave 42 properties. As many simply gave road names with no post code it was impossible to tell where exactly they were. Only one property was obviously in Wanstead, a two bedroom flat in an ex-council block at \u00a382,000. </p> <p>But this site does offer a locations facility which gives you detailed area information on individual place names in Greater London including a description of the locale, travel times and routes to central London, schools, council tax bands, local estate agents and average property prices. Encouraged by the fact that prices for flats in Wanstead average at only \u00a368,000-\u00a380,000, I decided to widen couple B's options henceforth by looking at houses, too. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.propertyfinder.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.propertyfinder.co.uk</a> </p> <p> This site claims a national portfolio of over 30,000 properties with the bulk of its listings in the south so things looked good for couple B. But, when I entered two-bed properties at \u00a350,000-\u00a3150,000 in the postcodes E11 and E17, nothing came up. </p> <p>When searching for couple A, I found it wasn't worth wasting time using the site's quick search facility. I got far better results doing a detailed search which gives you a map of your chosen region and allows you to be far more specific about your needs. This threw up six suitable properties, though none were in Leeds itself, but within a fairly wide radius of the city as far afield as Ilkley. Choices included a large, four bed terraced house in Ilkley town centre at \u00a389,950, a three bed semi at \u00a3115,000 and two four bed detached properties at \u00a3129,950 and \u00a3137,500. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.fish4homes.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fish4homes.co.uk</a> </p> <p> This site, boasting 135,123 properties on its database the day I searched, was good and I'd definitely use it again. The searches were easy and straightforward to conduct and prompted well-presented results. Each property is ranked using a star system according to how closely they match the criteria input by the would-be buyers. Clicking on an icon beside each property description usefully shows you its location on a map of the area though, to be fair, this does little to tell strangers to the region about the characteristics and merits of individual areas. </p> <p>For couple A, it turned up 51 properties within their price range, most of which matched their criteria perfectly, ranging from \u00a359,950 for a three bed semi in Alwoodley, Leeds to \u00a3149,995 for a four bed detached in Shadwell, Leeds. Couple B were also given a comparably good choice with 10 two-bed flats in Wanstead, again with top three-star match ratings, varying in price from \u00a383,000 to \u00a3139,995. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.numberone4property.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.numberone4property.co.uk</a> </p> <p> Easy to navigate and use, this site lets you search for properties via county, postcode or by inputting a specific town. You can also specify your price range, but you can't refine your search further by inputting, for example, the minimum number of bedrooms or type of property such as house or flats. </p> <p>Somewhat bizarrely, whichever search method I used, I couldn't find anything in Wanstead while a search in nearby Walthamstow turned up 19 properties in couple A's price range, 17 of which matched their two-bedroom criteria. </p> <p>By simply entering \"Leeds\" and a \u00a350,000-\u00a3150,000 price range, the site swiftly came up with 25 properties, though it was a nuisance trawling through them to sift out the 11 houses with three or more bedrooms which matched couple B's needs. </p> <p>I then clicked on the site's promising \"neighbourhood information\" icon with the hope of getting the lowdown on various areas of Leeds. This came up with links to several websites offering local area information and services. </p> <p>Results were disappointing:<a href=\"http://www.upmystreet.com\">www.upmystreet.com</a> only gave me statistical information for the whole of Leeds with no descriptions of different areas; and <a href=\"http://www.knowhere.co.uk\">www.knowhere.co.uk</a> focused on telling young people where the best places are in Leeds to socialise, including a big section on the best skateboarding locations. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.assertahomes.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.assertahomes.com</a></p> <p> This is definitely one site I'd choose to use in future if only for the wealth of detailed information on offer. </p> <p>You can identify your area search by postcode, place name or clicking on a map and you can choose to refine your search criteria using many factors such as, must have a garden and/or off-street parking. </p> <p>For couple A I entered -postcode E11 which threw up 17 properties in Wanstead and adjacent Leytonstone. Calling up more information on one particular three bed terrace at \u00a3123,995 I got useful details including the full postcode, agent's details and the typical monthly mortgage payment on the property. It also gave me links to some useful local area information such as average property prices for the area. </p> <p>Entering \"Leeds, West Yorkshire\" within a five-mile radius prompted 154 properties within couple B's criteria while refining the criteria to zero miles radius still gave 42 suitable properties. Clicking on a link to agents in the area gave me details of 127. Other useful options on this site for home movers include a moving in checklist, the facility to change one's address online with utility providers and financial services providers, a link to a site which allows you to compare costs of different utility providers in your chosen area and a link to details of local removal firms. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.homedirectory.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.homedirectory.com</a> </p> <p> This site, claiming 100,000 properties online, provided quick and easy search facilities for 'Leeds' and came up with 65 properties within couple A's criteria, though it was obvious from the descriptions that these were drawn from quite a large radius around Leeds. Most agents are contactable via direct e-mail links from this site. The only downside was that some properties were labelled as already \"sold\". </p> <p>For couple B the site came up with five properties in Leytonstone, one of which was in Wanstead itself. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.propertyspy.com\">www.propertyspy.com</a> </p> <p> This hardly merits the label of a property search website. It came up with no properties within couple A's criteria for Leeds and only one in the whole of West Yorkshire. And there was nothing on offer in the whole of Greater London that fitted couple B's criteria! </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.housenet.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.housenet.co.uk</a> </p> <p> Another disappointing site which only allows very broad searches. The nearest match for couple A were 44 properties in West Yorkshire with three beds in the right price range, only two of which were actually in Leeds. As for couple B, it was impossible to refine their search beyond 'London' which returned 80 matches. It seemed too much of a hassle to trawl through the whole list in the hope of finding a property in the right East London locale. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.houseweb.com\">www.houseweb.com</a> </p> <p> Call me stupid, but the search facilities on this site proved a complete puzzle and trying to find my way around them felt like being in a bizarre dream. However, I eventually located one suitable Leeds property for couple A plus seven more through a link to the fish4homes website. Using the same advanced search facility for couple B, I found five suitable Wanstead properties- again through the fish4homes link.</p>",

Just as investors and analysts were almost giving up hope that life remained in a sector that no longer had much prospect of growing fat on mortgage business, Barclays' bid approach to Woolwich demonstrates the need for the further consolidation of sprawling high street savings and lending outlets. Growth in home banking and pensions provision spurs on amalgamation. </p> <p>A union of the bank with the highest number of online customers and the building society-turned-bank with the most advanced internet system, but not too many outlets, could boost private customer business and profitability. </p> <p>Other mortgage providers, particularly the two leaders Halifax and Abbey National, are struggling to ensure the reliability of their software and service to on-line depositors and borrowers in a much more competitive market. Nevertheless, Abbey National is high on the list of those expected to receive a takeover offer. Lloyds TSB is considered to be ready for a further hefty acquisition in order to provide yet more scope for cost-cutting. </p> <p>Under new top management Lloyds TSB will want to confirm its reputation as the most efficient retail bank. That followed its ground-breaking purchase of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society in 1995. Former societies with a regional bias, like Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester, are also considered to be takeover candidates. A&amp;L might be most attractive to a foreign bank interested in the Giro business it bought for a song from the government in 1990. </p> <p>Bancassurance combinations are a must for any financial retailer and with Equitable Life on offer, the life assurance sector is now a field for financial giants only. It has become glaringly apparent in recent years that good bankers are in desperately short supply, hence the resort to overseas talent. </p> <p>Against the advice of the departing regulator, the government is apparently ready to accept the trend towards further consolidation in banking. Curbing charges by any means other than encouraging them to compete from a position of strength in a market open to smaller internet operators and larger international universal banks would be bureaucratic and difficult to police. </p> <p>Assuming that the wide swings in banking profits during the decades of the stop-go economy and virulent inflation are less likely in future, windfall profits tax, like government rescues of imprudent financial institutions, should be monuments only to past folly. </p> <p>On the world scene, UK banks are of minor importance following disastrous expansion and lending, particularly on property, by the Big Four 20 years or more ago. Their withdrawal from large-scale overseas lending and investment banking continued until recently after defaults on Russian debt. </p> <p>Only HSBC, with Midland in the fold and vast, if variable, profits accruing from its Hong Kong chains, has kept up overseas expansion, with multi-billion New York and French acquisitions. Royal Bank of Scotland's relative success in America enabled it to take over the larger NatWest in this year's most notable upheaval. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the American, Swiss and German banks, which made fewer mistakes on the international scene and were able to benefit from the New York-led boom in investment business and merger deals, are dominant in the City of London. </p> <p>In other financial centres UK-registered banks have little presence and may be sub-underwriters at best. At present syndicated loan business is about to boom again, with a record issue by Deutsche Telekom, the part-privatised German, UK and international fixed-line and mobile telecommunications giant, followed by a multi-billion debt flotation by the Anglo-Dutch food and toiletries combine Unilever. BT is expected to be next on the list. The lion's share of the fees for this issue will go to American and continental finance houses. The connections and sheer clout exercised by Goldman Sachs and a few others has brought soaring returns on top of monumental prestige. </p> <p>Yet, in spite of their superior range and management , many of the top national banks of other countries, including the US, Germany and, at least until recently, Switzerland and France can only envy the high profits made by the main UK high street banks, except when monstrous bad debts blotted their copybooks. </p> <p>Depending on government curbs on consumption and wild swings in the official bank lending rate, these banks and most building societies were able to earn handsome returns on their most humdrum business. Fast-moving mortgage charges, low deposit rates and inert depositors were gifts to financial institutions. </p> <p>Many managers were little more than part-time, unless golf-course work was included. Fixed-rate mortgages are still far less common than they are overseas. Pay rewards were also appropriately modest before the demands of information technology and demutualisation. </p> <p>Now IT, involving expenditure in billions for a large bank and proportionately more for a smaller one, is crucial to banking success and it is a sellers' market for those with the professional expertise. Bloated pay-offs for directors, not least those who have conspicuously failed, have become the norm, but that is a relic of inadequate competition. </p> <p>Offerings of banking services from internet specialists and foreign institutions with no encumbrances on the ground except, perhaps, in the City, should ensure a wide choice for customers. </p> <p>Profit margins above interest paid on deposits will narrow and the days of high inflation and negligible real returns for investors are almost over. Bank shares themselves offer highly attractive yields.The legacy from the elimination of weak banks and rise of technology and competition looks promising. So the worst should be over for investors in banks. </p>",

Under new top management Lloyds TSB will want to confirm its reputation as the most efficient retail bank. That followed its ground-breaking purchase of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society in 1995. Former societies with a regional bias, like Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester, are also considered to be takeover candidates. A&amp;L might be most attractive to a foreign bank interested in the Giro business it bought for a song from the government in 1990. Bancassurance combinations are a must for any financial retailer and with Equitable Life on offer, the life assurance sector is now a field for financial giants only. It has become glaringly apparent in recent years that good bankers are in desperately short supply, hence the resort to overseas talent. Against the advice of the departing regulator, the government is apparently ready to accept the trend towards further consolidation in banking. Curbing charges by any means other than encouraging them to compete from a position of strength in a market open to smaller internet operators and larger international universal banks would be bureaucratic and difficult to police. Assuming that the wide swings in banking profits during the decades of the stop-go economy and virulent inflation are less likely in future, windfall profits tax, like government rescues of imprudent financial institutions, should be monuments only to past folly. On the world scene, UK banks are of minor importance following disastrous expansion and lending, particularly on property, by the Big Four 20 years or more ago. Their withdrawal from large-scale overseas lending and investment banking continued until recently after defaults on Russian debt. Only HSBC, with Midland in the fold and vast, if variable, profits accruing from its Hong Kong chains, has kept up overseas expansion, with multi-billion New York and French acquisitions. Royal Bank of Scotland's relative success in America enabled it to take over the larger NatWest in this year's most notable upheaval. Nevertheless, the American, Swiss and German banks, which made fewer mistakes on the international scene and were able to benefit from the New York-led boom in investment business and merger deals, are dominant in the City of London. In other financial centres UK-registered banks have little presence and may be sub-underwriters at best. At present syndicated loan business is about to boom again, with a record issue by Deutsche Telekom, the part-privatised German, UK and international fixed-line and mobile telecommunications giant, followed by a multi-billion debt flotation by the Anglo-Dutch food and toiletries combine Unilever. BT is expected to be next on the list. The lion's share of the fees for this issue will go to American and continental finance houses. The connections and sheer clout exercised by Goldman Sachs and a few others has brought soaring returns on top of monumental prestige. Yet, in spite of their superior range and management , many of the top national banks of other countries, including the US, Germany and, at least until recently, Switzerland and France can only envy the high profits made by the main UK high street banks, except when monstrous bad debts blotted their copybooks. Depending on government curbs on consumption and wild swings in the official bank lending rate, these banks and most building societies were able to earn handsome returns on their most humdrum business. Fast-moving mortgage charges, low deposit rates and inert depositors were gifts to financial institutions. Many managers were little more than part-time, unless golf-course work was included. Fixed-rate mortgages are still far less common than they are overseas. Pay rewards were also appropriately modest before the demands of information technology and demutualisation. Now IT, involving expenditure in billions for a large bank and proportionately more for a smaller one, is crucial to banking success and it is a sellers' market for those with the professional expertise. Bloated pay-offs for directors, not least those who have conspicuously failed, have become the norm, but that is a relic of inadequate competition. Offerings of banking services from internet specialists and foreign institutions with no encumbrances on the ground except, perhaps, in the City, should ensure a wide choice for customers. Profit margins above interest paid on deposits will narrow and the days of high inflation and negligible real returns for investors are almost over. Bank shares themselves offer highly attractive yields.The legacy from the elimination of weak banks and rise of technology and competition looks promising. So the worst should be over for investors in banks.",

But the recordings by Murray Perahia and Krystian Zimerman really stand head and shoulders above the rest, and it is hard to decide between them. Perahia's reading is one his finest achievements on disc, deeply felt, sumptuously coloured, and always perfectly balanced Zimerman's is equally aristocratic, full of subtleties of touch and timbre and a constant awareness of Chopin's architecture. Both contain superlative piano playing, and if Zimerman just gets my vote, others may well favour Perahia. Key Recording: Zimerman (Deutsche Grammophon 423 090-2)",

      "body": "<p><strong>THE BIG MAN'S BACK AGAIN (DEDICATED TO THE NEO-EVERTON REGIME)</strong></p> <p>Now that Everton have given football funster Paul Gazza a drink in the last chance saloon, every fan in the country will be wishing him well and hoping he can get his act together for one last hurrah. There's no better place for Gazza to regroup than the school of science, after all, and avuncular manager Walter Smith will be a calming influence. You won't catch him spoiling the disciplined and professional atmosphere around the place by dragging, for example, Barlinnie's finest boozer Duncan Ferguson back to Goodi... ah.</p> <p>Smith today announced that Everton have \"more or less completed negotiations with Newcastle\" for Ferguson, who still has a tattoo of the Everton club crest on his arm. A \u00a33.7m bid for the giant pigeon-fancier has been tabled and accepted, giving the Toffees a \u00a34.3m profit on the deal, and all that remains is for the player to agree on terms. This could be a problem: the Scottish giant is currently earning \u00a340,000-a-week, much more than Everton are prepared to pay.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Smith remains in a positive frame of mind. \"Am I optimistic? I am always optimistic!\" he said today, sounding happy (but maintaining his typically dour facade, you'll be pleased to hear). \"I know all about Duncan and I need to add to our strike force,\" he chirruped through a grimace, \"and we are now discussing the situation with the player's representatives.\" If all goes to plan, Everton fans will be over the moon to see the return of their hero - let's just hope Gazza doesn't plan the welcoming party, eh?</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Manage a fantasy football team online and win \u00a325,000. Register for free <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/games/fantasia2000/guardian\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>THE SEASON: IT'S FREE</strong></p> <p>The Season! It's free! It's an 84-page colour magazine! It's not available in Scotland! Yes, if you buy the Guardian on Monday morning you'll get this lovely little book filled with facts, analysis, fixture lists and previews. Unless you live in Scotland. It's got everything you'll need for the coming season, so it's such a shame that you'll accidentally throw it out with the rest of the papers on Tuesday morning.</p> <p><strong>CHARITY BEGINS AT 4PM ON SUNDAY</strong></p> <p>It's the big game at Wembley on Sunday afternoon, as Manchester United and Chelsea's of Chelsea compete for everyone's favourite pre-season platter, the Charity Shield. United haven't done too well in this fixture over the past couple of years - not that they'll care too much, because after losing dismally, they go on to win all the games people actually remember. Even so, they won't mind having a ready-made excuse should they get tonked this year: David Beckham is suffering from an injured back.</p> <p>According to the official Manchester United website (go to <a href=\"http://www.crewealex.co.uk\">http://www.crewealex.co.uk</a> instead, United fans, and share around the hits), Beckham \"started hobbling\" an hour into an open training session at Old Trafford and ended up \"face down on the grass\". Poor Becks then got a nice massage by the club physio and spent the rest of the session sitting on his arse with his hands on his back. Alex Ferguson thinks everything will be alright, however: \"David took a slight knock to the small of his back but he'll be fine for Sunday. These things happen.\"</p> <p>United will still have to do without Jaap Stam, who hasn't been sleeping (he always has bad dreams about Nicolas Anelka around this time of year). Chelsea's, meanwhile, have no such worries. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Stanic will make their debuts from the start, but Christian Panucci will have to make do with resting his big boots on the bench. The Fiver can't wait for the two teams to kick off, but whatever happens, we should never forget it's all about charity. That's why the players donate their week's wages to the fund, after all. Hold on, that doesn't happen, does it?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have the philosophy that individuals play, teams win championships\" - Arsenal's George Graham, the manager of Tottenham, sets out his philosophy. Fans weaned on the glory, glory days will love that.</p> <p><strong>ODE TO JOY</strong></p> <p>You might not hear the clarion call from the Premiership-fixated Sky. And we're pretty certain that some Johnny-come-lately called Giles won't be banging on about it in the pub tonight either. But to the rest of us, the new English season kicks off tomorrow, and the Fiver is positively giddy. In fact we're so giddy we want to steam out of our poorly air-conditioned office, punch the air wildly in youthful celebration and give the next young lady we see a big manly hug. Come on girls, we don't bite!</p> <p>But our enthusiasm is disappointingly low-key compared to Palace chairman Simon Jordan, who tomorrow will watch his side take on bookies faves Blackburn. \"The first task is to put the club back in its proper position,\" said young Simon - think Mark Goldberg II - level-headedly, until he betrayed his pent-up excitement with the wild: \"We are the fourth biggest club in London!\" Meanwhile, all across the capital, you could hear slightly disgruntled Charlton, Fulham and Wimbledon fans stroking their chinny-chin-chins. Yet why shouldn't he be optimistic? Everyone is at this time of year, and rightly so. By September the Fiver will be heartily sick of hearing managers proclaiming: \"We are prepared as well as possible but there are 46 games and it is going to be a long, hard season,\" like Terry Burton did in pure footie-speak today. Or hearing about Sam Hammam's latest prank at Cardiff - yesterday he let down the tyres of several players' cars, so the Deep-Heat-in-the-jockstrap gag can only be weeks away. But at the moment we don't care a jot. Football is back, and we're about to go wild.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Zinedine Zidane's agent has begun talks with Barcelona over a \u00a340.7m move, according to onefootball. His agent Alaen Migliascio admitted: \"I'm negotiating with Barca, who after losing Figo want to take a big step and play Zidane alongside Rivaldo.\" However, Juventus president Gianni Agnelli has said there is no way the deal will go through.</p> <p>Manchester United are sensationally planning to offer Real Madrid \u00a39m for Steve McManaman. Spanish newspaper AS claims that McManaman \"would find it very difficult to say no to an offer from United\", despite the winger's claims that he does not want to return to England.</p> <p>Middlesbrough are lining up an \u00a38m bid for Aston Villa's unsettled defender Ugo Ehiogu, according to Teamtalk.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Charlton will observe a minute's silence before the game against Vicenza at The Valley tomorrow in memory of Pierre Bolangi, who drowned while on a training exercise with the Army earlier this week.</p> <p>Steve Howey has completed his \u00a32m move to Manchester City from Newcastle. Howey came through a medical today and has agreed a four-year contract.</p> <p>Crystal Palace have signed Jamie Pollock from Manchester City for \u00a3750,000.

      "bodyText": "THE BIG MAN'S BACK AGAIN (DEDICATED TO THE NEO-EVERTON REGIME) Now that Everton have given football funster Paul Gazza a drink in the last chance saloon, every fan in the country will be wishing him well and hoping he can get his act together for one last hurrah. There's no better place for Gazza to regroup than the school of science, after all, and avuncular manager Walter Smith will be a calming influence. You won't catch him spoiling the disciplined and professional atmosphere around the place by dragging, for example, Barlinnie's finest boozer Duncan Ferguson back to Goodi... ah. Smith today announced that Everton have \"more or less completed negotiations with Newcastle\" for Ferguson, who still has a tattoo of the Everton club crest on his arm. A \u00a33.7m bid for the giant pigeon-fancier has been tabled and accepted, giving the Toffees a \u00a34.3m profit on the deal, and all that remains is for the player to agree on terms. This could be a problem: the Scottish giant is currently earning \u00a340,000-a-week, much more than Everton are prepared to pay. Nevertheless, Smith remains in a positive frame of mind. \"Am I optimistic? I am always optimistic!\" he said today, sounding happy (but maintaining his typically dour facade, you'll be pleased to hear). \"I know all about Duncan and I need to add to our strike force,\" he chirruped through a grimace, \"and we are now discussing the situation with the player's representatives.\" If all goes to plan, Everton fans will be over the moon to see the return of their hero - let's just hope Gazza doesn't plan the welcoming party, eh?

It's not available in Scotland! Yes, if you buy the Guardian on Monday morning you'll get this lovely little book filled with facts, analysis, fixture lists and previews. Unless you live in Scotland. It's got everything you'll need for the coming season, so it's such a shame that you'll accidentally throw it out with the rest of the papers on Tuesday morning. CHARITY BEGINS AT 4PM ON SUNDAY It's the big game at Wembley on Sunday afternoon, as Manchester United and Chelsea's of Chelsea compete for everyone's favourite pre-season platter, the Charity Shield. United haven't done too well in this fixture over the past couple of years - not that they'll care too much, because after losing dismally, they go on to win all the games people actually remember. Even so, they won't mind having a ready-made excuse should they get tonked this year: David Beckham is suffering from an injured back. According to the official Manchester United website (go to http://www.crewealex.co.uk instead, United fans, and share around the hits), Beckham \"started hobbling\" an hour into an open training session at Old Trafford and ended up \"face down on the grass\". Poor Becks then got a nice massage by the club physio and spent the rest of the session sitting on his arse with his hands on his back. Alex Ferguson thinks everything will be alright, however: \"David took a slight knock to the small of his back but he'll be fine for Sunday. These things happen.\" United will still have to do without Jaap Stam, who hasn't been sleeping (he always has bad dreams about Nicolas Anelka around this time of year). Chelsea's, meanwhile, have no such worries. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Stanic will make their debuts from the start, but Christian Panucci will have to make do with resting his big boots on the bench. The Fiver can't wait for the two teams to kick off, but whatever happens, we should never forget it's all about charity. That's why the players donate their week's wages to the fund, after all. Hold on, that doesn't happen, does it? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I have the philosophy that individuals play, teams win championships\" - Arsenal's George Graham, the manager of Tottenham, sets out his philosophy. Fans weaned on the glory, glory days will love that. ODE TO JOY You might not hear the clarion call from the Premiership-fixated Sky. And we're pretty certain that some Johnny-come-lately called Giles won't be banging on about it in the pub tonight either. But to the rest of us, the new English season kicks off tomorrow, and the Fiver is positively giddy. In fact we're so giddy we want to steam out of our poorly air-conditioned office, punch the air wildly in youthful celebration and give the next young lady we see a big manly hug. Come on girls, we don't bite! But our enthusiasm is disappointingly low-key compared to Palace chairman Simon Jordan, who tomorrow will watch his side take on bookies faves Blackburn. \"The first task is to put the club back in its proper position,\" said young Simon - think Mark Goldberg II - level-headedly, until he betrayed his pent-up excitement with the wild: \"We are the fourth biggest club in London!\" Meanwhile, all across the capital, you could hear slightly disgruntled Charlton, Fulham and Wimbledon fans stroking their chinny-chin-chins. Yet why shouldn't he be optimistic? Everyone is at this time of year, and rightly so. By September the Fiver will be heartily sick of hearing managers proclaiming: \"We are prepared as well as possible but there are 46 games and it is going to be a long, hard season,\" like Terry Burton did in pure footie-speak today. Or hearing about Sam Hammam's latest prank at Cardiff - yesterday he let down the tyres of several players' cars, so the Deep-Heat-in-the-jockstrap gag can only be weeks away. But at the moment we don't care a jot. Football is back, and we're about to go wild. THE RUMOUR MILL Zinedine Zidane's agent has begun talks with Barcelona over a \u00a340.7m move, according to onefootball. His agent Alaen Migliascio admitted: \"I'm negotiating with Barca, who after losing Figo want to take a big step and play Zidane alongside Rivaldo.\" However, Juventus president Gianni Agnelli has said there is no way the deal will go through. Manchester United are sensationally planning to offer Real Madrid \u00a39m for Steve McManaman. Spanish newspaper AS claims that McManaman \"would find it very difficult to say no to an offer from United\", despite the winger's claims that he does not want to return to England. Middlesbrough are lining up an \u00a38m bid for Aston Villa's unsettled defender Ugo Ehiogu, according to Teamtalk. NEWS IN BRIEF Charlton will observe a minute's silence before the game against Vicenza at The Valley tomorrow in memory of Pierre Bolangi, who drowned while on a training exercise with the Army earlier this week. Steve Howey has completed his \u00a32m move to Manchester City from Newcastle. Howey came through a medical today and has agreed a four-year contract. Crystal Palace have signed Jamie Pollock from Manchester City for \u00a3750,000. The 26-year-old midfielder has been included in Palace's squad for tomorrow's game against Blackburn. Hassan Kachloul has rejected a \u00a32m move to Ipswich. The Moroccan midfielder said: \"I have respect for Ipswich, and I like the fans and club. However, I want to see out the last year of my contract at Southampton.\" The chief executive of the Wembley Stadium project has angrily denied suggestions that the cost of construction is set to soar beyond the \u00a31bn mark. \"Stories that the cost has gone up are absolutely not true,\" said WNSL chief executive Bob Stubbs. \"In fact, we are taking steps to ensure that the price does not rise by negotiating a guaranteed maximum price with the building contractors.\" Uefa have confirmed that referee Costas Kapitanis made a mistake in giving Leeds midfielder Eirik Bakke a straight red card during the Big Cup game against 1860 Munich on Wednesday. Bakke should have been sent off for two bookable offences and, as a result, will only be suspended for one match. Germany will almost certainly be without key midfielder Jens Jeremies when they face England in a World Cup qualifier on October 7. The Bayern Munich star has suffered knee ligament damage in training and has been ruled out of action for two to three months. Wolves have signed former Swindon goalkeeper Frank Talia on a month's contract after second-choice keeper Mike Stowell picked up an ankle injury. Sheffield Wednesday have signed Simon Grayson on a month's loan from Blackburn. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 3: Football (8pm) An hour-and-a-half of last season's play-off finals is all good and well. But why would we want to watch it when we've got a videotape of last night's Burnside? Hmm? Can you tell us that?",

For one thing, you are a person who can afford to spend \u00a31,500 on a pair of shoes. As a pedestrian, you are privileged - you have your own customised craft. You have more in common with the motorist than with the man who takes public transport. You have, as it were, \"two Jags\" on your feet. You are a fierce individualist. You are making a statement about yourself. You are a person who can, in all honesty, say the words \"my shoemaker\".</p> <p>William Hague's shoemaker is GJ Cleverley, one of five companies in London that make traditional bespoke men's shoes. The others are Lobb's, Maxwell's, Foster's, and Taylor's. Bespoke shoes for women are an altogether different matter, attended to in Paris, or at the very least Sloane St. But to get to Cleverley's you turn into the dinky, shadowy Royal Arcade which joins Old Bond Street to Albermarle Street. The shop is, of course, tiny and shady. The workshop above, where the shoes are wrought, is a cramped smithy, full of antique-looking tools and rolls of leather. It looks like a place of solid craftsmanship, a place into which gimmickry has never entered. You enter by climbing a steep spiral staircase; the first thing you notice is a piece of leather soaking in a bucket of water.</p> <p>John Carnera, one of the two proprietors of GJ Cleverley, says that bespoke shoes are made in the same way as they were made a century ago. Technology has not altered the process one whit. It still takes three months to make the first pair for a client; he - it is almost without exception a he - must come in for three fittings. It is a process of customising, of gradual building. Along with the shoe, one thing that is being built, clearly, is the ego of the client. You put your foot on a book, and Carnera draws a line around it. He takes four measurements - heel to toe, width at the widest point, around the instep, and instep to heel. This is the first fitting. \"We have to get inside the minds of clients,\" he says. Some people like their shoes loose; some like them tight. Bony feet are the hardest to accommodate. But Carnera does not talk about his clients' feet. That's another thing you get with a bespoke shoemaker - like an accountant, a lawyer, or a spin doctor, he will keep your secrets.</p> <p>How does it make you feel, having your feet so closely studied? It feels good. It is not without symbolic, even biblical, connotations. This is ministration. It tickles slightly, but not in an unpleasant way.</p> <p>\"I've taken a photographic picture in my mind of your foot,\" says Carnera, who was born in Udine, Italy, and came to England at the age of seven. Having worked for Cleverley's since the 70s, he and a colleague, George Glasgow, took over when George Cleverley died in 1993 at the age of 92. Along with the traditional virtues of bespoke shoemaking, Cleverley's is known for elegance. \"Now, is that a chiselled toe!\" says Carnera, handling a dressy half-brogue.</p> <p>Having measured your foot, Carnera fashions a last - a wooden, shoe-shaped snapshot of your foot. Then the leather work begins. \"Calf\" - the tanned hides of calves, which are 10 or 12 feet long, and softer at the rump than the shoulder - is the staple. \"We do scour the world for materials,\" says Carnera - words which must have a pleasant ring to an ambitious opposition leader. The front of a good shoe is rump; the heel portion is cut from further forward. The lining, the part which cushions the toe, is soft horsehide.</p> <p>If the craftsmanship at Cleverley's has not changed for a century, neither have the fashions. It's not that they could not cater for new lines; it's that the clients do not want them. The men who come here want some things to be like they were 100 years ago, when Britain was great, when the map was pink, the pound strong, the Navy invincible, the Channel a wide, insurmountable gulf.</p> <p>Hague wears Oxfords - one pair with a plain toecap, one a half-brogue. Some people want the Derby, a more rustic version of the Oxford. Some want the Cambridge, which is a slip-on version of the Oxford. Carnera shows me a pair of Oxfords which have come in for their first mending; the date is 1989. They might need to be mended again in another decade.</p> <p>These, then, are not the shoes of a careful, image-conscious politician. They would not go down well in a focus group. They are the shoes of an empire-builder, an egotist, a show-off. They might be a cad's shoes. James Hewitt might wear shoes like this, as might Chris Eubank. They are not Conservative in the sense of John Major. They are Napoleonic. \"When you take them off,\" says Carnera, \"you have to put the trees in while they're still warm.\" You can almost hear the words, in that clipped Rotherham accent: \"Hang on, Ffion. I won't be a minute.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Botox has become the acceptable face of cosmetic surgery. Women who scoff at the cartoonish effects of silicone breasts and collagen lips, and would not contemplate the risk, pain and inconvenience of going \"under the knife\" for a face lift, are succumbing to the appeal of swift, easy Botox injections to rub out their wrinkles. Annie Boyd, previously insecure about her crow's feet due to a sun-worshipping adolescence, says: \"It's about the price of three good facials [\u00a3150-200] and far more effective.\" She went out for dinner after her first treatment and by the time dessert appeared, her crow's feet had begun to disappear. So impressive were the results that her dining companion booked in for Botox the next day.</p> <p>Boyd is 27. While face lifts are rarely sought by the young, Botox, the soft drug of the cosmetic procedure world, is introducing an ever-younger audience to preserving their unlined looks. According to fashion and beauty photographer Iain Philpott: \"Rarely a day goes by when someone in the studio isn't discussing the pros and cons of Botox.\" Philpott knows at least one 23-year-old supermodel whose forehead is frozen. She is thrilled with it.</p> <p>Botox is derived from botulin, the toxic bacteria less glamorously associated with poisoned grannies and ancient tins of food. Injections of minuscule amounts of botulinum toxin type A affect nerve-endings, preventing the brain from transmitting the chemical messages that make facial muscles contract. It has been used for over a decade to help people who suffer from facial spasms and is now known as the \"poor man's face lift\". </p> <p>Slight bruising and an insect bite-like sting can be expected during the 15-minute treatment but after five or six days, hey presto: no facial movement in targeted areas for up to four months, allowing existing lines to smooth out and preventing new lines appearing. After the first year, the paralysed muscles slowly begin to atrophy and less Botox is needed for the same effect. </p> <p>Dr Alastair Carruthers, one half of the husband and wife dermatologist-ophthalmologist team who pioneered the cosmetic use of Botox, proclaims that his wife Jean \"hasn't frowned for 10 years\". Charles Darwin would be horrified: in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, he wrote that frowning was \"one of the most important of all expressions\". His mentor, Sir Charles Bell, believed the corrugator muscle that causes brows to knit \"the most remarkable muscle of the human face\" and praised its ability to \"convey the idea of mind\".</p> <p>In Beverly Hills, Botox is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery procedure. One of its greatest fans is Dr Larry Koplin, who Botoxes himself and most of his patients. He feels it is a great addition to his techniques \"to create a sculpting of the face. I don't believe we're creating a generation of Dorian Grays but rather creating the ability for people to look the way they feel.\" But if you can't raise your eyebrows, you will just look stunned when surprised because only your eyes will widen. </p> <p>The evolutionary purpose behind the surprised expression is to widen the eyes as quickly as possible. Try opening your eyes as wide as possible without raising the eyebrows; it takes twice as long. If you are very angry or concerned, and a generous dose of Botox has rendered your \"remarkable\" corrugators kaput, your eyes will merely narrow slightly. If you can't move your eyebrows inwards or upwards, the one expression that will be impossible is that of horror. Drastic loss of expression happens only with extensive use, however. The impact on facial movement of Boyd's treatment for crow's feet is barely perceptible: there is none of the tautness of traditional face lifts. </p> <p>But a cavalier attitude among women desperate to avoid wrinkles is common: Dr Patrick Bowler of Harley Street, one of London's leading Botox specialists, reports that \"younger clients are less attached than older ones to their facial expressions\" and says many come in explaining they \"don't want to frown any more\". </p> <p>Bowler is an advocate of the less is more policy, preferring to inject less and have people come back a few weeks later for a top-up injection if desired. He is careful to prevent Botox tolerance developing and makes over-enthusiastic patients sign agreements not to seek further treatment until a specific date. He is also meticulous about concentration levels. </p> <p>Botox comes as a powder and has to be reconstituted with a saline solution; some practitioners dilute it too much, causing it to spread into the wrong muscles: in these rare cases, a droopy eyelid or eyebrow can occur because some of the material injected finds its way into those muscles unknowingly.</p> <p>However, while some people who \"suffer\" from wrinkles are thinking about Botox injections to limit expressive movement in the face, others are born without the ability to use their face to make an emotional connection with those around them. Socialising is very difficult for sufferers of the rare genetic disorder Moebius Syndrome, the distinctive feature of which is lack of facial expression. Tudy McNabb, mother of a sufferer and member of a Moebius Syndrome support group in the US, says of her son: \"When he was little, not having facial expressions made him look very dull.\" </p> <p>Some sufferers try to overcome this by undergoing \"smile surgery\" which removes muscle from the thigh and attaches it to the biting muscle around the mouth. With much practice, a smile can be achieved by biting down; over a long period of time, the smile becomes a natural reflex. As one recipient enthuses: \"When a stranger smiles at me now, I can smile back!\"</p> <p>The actress-scientist Hedy Lamarr provided an interesting angle on glamour and dullness. In 1942, the year Louis B Mayer described her as \"the most beautiful girl in the world\", she secured a patent for her futuristic invention of \"frequency hopping\" whereby radio signals could be transmitted using random changes in frequency. Even today, it inspires internet and cellular phone technology. </p> <p>Many years have passed since she made the ruthless observation: \"Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\" Dr Patrick Bowler's clinic is on 01277 203000</p>",

Women who scoff at the cartoonish effects of silicone breasts and collagen lips, and would not contemplate the risk, pain and inconvenience of going \"under the knife\" for a face lift, are succumbing to the appeal of swift, easy Botox injections to rub out their wrinkles. Annie Boyd, previously insecure about her crow's feet due to a sun-worshipping adolescence, says: \"It's about the price of three good facials [\u00a3150-200] and far more effective.\" She went out for dinner after her first treatment and by the time dessert appeared, her crow's feet had begun to disappear. So impressive were the results that her dining companion booked in for Botox the next day. Boyd is 27. While face lifts are rarely sought by the young, Botox, the soft drug of the cosmetic procedure world, is introducing an ever-younger audience to preserving their unlined looks. According to fashion and beauty photographer Iain Philpott: \"Rarely a day goes by when someone in the studio isn't discussing the pros and cons of Botox.\" Philpott knows at least one 23-year-old supermodel whose forehead is frozen. She is thrilled with it. Botox is derived from botulin, the toxic bacteria less glamorously associated with poisoned grannies and ancient tins of food. Injections of minuscule amounts of botulinum toxin type A affect nerve-endings, preventing the brain from transmitting the chemical messages that make facial muscles contract. It has been used for over a decade to help people who suffer from facial spasms and is now known as the \"poor man's face lift\". Slight bruising and an insect bite-like sting can be expected during the 15-minute treatment but after five or six days, hey presto: no facial movement in targeted areas for up to four months, allowing existing lines to smooth out and preventing new lines appearing. After the first year, the paralysed muscles slowly begin to atrophy and less Botox is needed for the same effect. Dr Alastair Carruthers, one half of the husband and wife dermatologist-ophthalmologist team who pioneered the cosmetic use of Botox, proclaims that his wife Jean \"hasn't frowned for 10 years\". Charles Darwin would be horrified: in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, he wrote that frowning was \"one of the most important of all expressions\". His mentor, Sir Charles Bell, believed the corrugator muscle that causes brows to knit \"the most remarkable muscle of the human face\" and praised its ability to \"convey the idea of mind\". In Beverly Hills, Botox is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery procedure. One of its greatest fans is Dr Larry Koplin, who Botoxes himself and most of his patients. He feels it is a great addition to his techniques \"to create a sculpting of the face. I don't believe we're creating a generation of Dorian Grays but rather creating the ability for people to look the way they feel.\" But if you can't raise your eyebrows, you will just look stunned when surprised because only your eyes will widen. The evolutionary purpose behind the surprised expression is to widen the eyes as quickly as possible. Try opening your eyes as wide as possible without raising the eyebrows; it takes twice as long. If you are very angry or concerned, and a generous dose of Botox has rendered your \"remarkable\" corrugators kaput, your eyes will merely narrow slightly. If you can't move your eyebrows inwards or upwards, the one expression that will be impossible is that of horror. Drastic loss of expression happens only with extensive use, however. The impact on facial movement of Boyd's treatment for crow's feet is barely perceptible: there is none of the tautness of traditional face lifts. But a cavalier attitude among women desperate to avoid wrinkles is common: Dr Patrick Bowler of Harley Street, one of London's leading Botox specialists, reports that \"younger clients are less attached than older ones to their facial expressions\" and says many come in explaining they \"don't want to frown any more\". Bowler is an advocate of the less is more policy, preferring to inject less and have people come back a few weeks later for a top-up injection if desired. He is careful to prevent Botox tolerance developing and makes over-enthusiastic patients sign agreements not to seek further treatment until a specific date. He is also meticulous about concentration levels. Botox comes as a powder and has to be reconstituted with a saline solution; some practitioners dilute it too much, causing it to spread into the wrong muscles: in these rare cases, a droopy eyelid or eyebrow can occur because some of the material injected finds its way into those muscles unknowingly. However, while some people who \"suffer\" from wrinkles are thinking about Botox injections to limit expressive movement in the face, others are born without the ability to use their face to make an emotional connection with those around them. Socialising is very difficult for sufferers of the rare genetic disorder Moebius Syndrome, the distinctive feature of which is lack of facial expression. Tudy McNabb, mother of a sufferer and member of a Moebius Syndrome support group in the US, says of her son: \"When he was little, not having facial expressions made him look very dull.\" Some sufferers try to overcome this by undergoing \"smile surgery\" which removes muscle from the thigh and attaches it to the biting muscle around the mouth. With much practice, a smile can be achieved by biting down; over a long period of time, the smile becomes a natural reflex. As one recipient enthuses: \"When a stranger smiles at me now, I can smile back!\" The actress-scientist Hedy Lamarr provided an interesting angle on glamour and dullness. In 1942, the year Louis B Mayer described her as \"the most beautiful girl in the world\", she secured a patent for her futuristic invention of \"frequency hopping\" whereby radio signals could be transmitted using random changes in frequency. Even today, it inspires internet and cellular phone technology. Many years have passed since she made the ruthless observation: \"Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.\" Dr Patrick Bowler's clinic is on 01277 203000",

      "body": "<b>How much does an American presidential election cost?</b> <br> Democracy US-style has never come cheap - and the cost is rising. By this stage of the 1996 election, the candidates had spent some $237.2 million between them, up from about $123 million in 1992. So far this year the campaign has cost well over $350 million. <p><b>Who has most money to spend?</b><br> George Bush is well ahead: to date he's raised $93,260,829 and spent $81,038,713. Al Gore, in contrast, has raised $52,568,089 and spent $41,841,378. </p> <p><b>Are there any rules? </b><br> Yes - and they are complex. The first legislation regulating federal campaign finance was introduced between 1905 and 1908 in an attempt to limit the disproportionate influence over elections held by wealthy individuals. In 1974, after dubious practises were reported in the 1972 election, legislation led to the creation of the federal election commission: the biggest innovation was the introduction of partial public funding of candidates. Since then, the rules have remained more or less the same - although many Americans are now unhappy with them and want reform. Campaign finance reform was a major part of John McCain's campaign for the Republican nomination, although it has now fallen off his party's agenda.</p> <p><b>And what are these rules? </b><br> In short, contributions by individuals and groups to federal campaigns are limited to a direct contribution of $1,000 a year and $25,000 a year in total. Contributions by certain groups - such as foreign nationals and corporations - are prohibited. In return for accepting limits on overall campaign spending, candidates are given federal grants. In 1996, the major parties each received $12.36 million.</p> <p><b>That sounds fair</b><br> Yes - but candidates have hardly been constrained by the rules. This year, for instance, George Bush has refused to take federal funds and so been released from official limits on how much he can spend. Candidates can also be supported by independent donations, which back their cause but don't go directly to their campaign. Much TV advertising is paid for this way. Such so-called soft-money contributions are arguably illegal, since most candidates establish committees to back their causes, which are barely separate from the campaign. However candidates prefer not to raise the issue since almost all of them risk trouble if the letter of the law is applied. </p> <p><b>Where do the contributions come from? </b><br> Much of the money of does come from small gifts. George Bush claims to have received 600,000 such donations at an average of $99.63. But much more comes from special interest groups. Bush is well ahead of Al Gore here, raising more money than his rival from almost every part of the economy. For instance the energy and natural resources sector has given governor Bush some $2,420,372 - but just $253,710 to Al Gore. Gore leads only in donations from labour unions, lawyers and lobbyists.</p> <p><b>But why do people give such vast amounts of money? </b><br> Sometimes they do it for ideological reasons. Both Bush and Gore's web sites allow the public to make credit card donations and list hundreds of people who have given small sums.

      "bodyText": "How much does an American presidential election cost? Democracy US-style has never come cheap - and the cost is rising. By this stage of the 1996 election, the candidates had spent some $237.2 million between them, up from about $123 million in 1992. So far this year the campaign has cost well over $350 million. Who has most money to spend? George Bush is well ahead: to date he's raised $93,260,829 and spent $81,038,713. Al Gore, in contrast, has raised $52,568,089 and spent $41,841,378. Are there any rules? Yes - and they are complex. The first legislation regulating federal campaign finance was introduced between 1905 and 1908 in an attempt to limit the disproportionate influence over elections held by wealthy individuals. In 1974, after dubious practises were reported in the 1972 election, legislation led to the creation of the federal election commission: the biggest innovation was the introduction of partial public funding of candidates. Since then, the rules have remained more or less the same - although many Americans are now unhappy with them and want reform. Campaign finance reform was a major part of John McCain's campaign for the Republican nomination, although it has now fallen off his party's agenda. And what are these rules? In short, contributions by individuals and groups to federal campaigns are limited to a direct contribution of $1,000 a year and $25,000 a year in total. Contributions by certain groups - such as foreign nationals and corporations - are prohibited. In return for accepting limits on overall campaign spending, candidates are given federal grants. In 1996, the major parties each received $12.36 million. That sounds fair Yes - but candidates have hardly been constrained by the rules. This year, for instance, George Bush has refused to take federal funds and so been released from official limits on how much he can spend. Candidates can also be supported by independent donations, which back their cause but don't go directly to their campaign. Much TV advertising is paid for this way. Such so-called soft-money contributions are arguably illegal, since most candidates establish committees to back their causes, which are barely separate from the campaign. However candidates prefer not to raise the issue since almost all of them risk trouble if the letter of the law is applied. Where do the contributions come from? Much of the money of does come from small gifts. George Bush claims to have received 600,000 such donations at an average of $99.63. But much more comes from special interest groups. Bush is well ahead of Al Gore here, raising more money than his rival from almost every part of the economy. For instance the energy and natural resources sector has given governor Bush some $2,420,372 - but just $253,710 to Al Gore. Gore leads only in donations from labour unions, lawyers and lobbyists. But why do people give such vast amounts of money? Sometimes they do it for ideological reasons. Both Bush and Gore's web sites allow the public to make credit card donations and list hundreds of people who have given small sums. But the real money is raised through the aggressive fundraising campaigns which take up much of an American politician's time. In return for contributions, big donors can expect access to the candidate and the chance of favours if he should win. Many US ambassadors receive their jobs in this way What sort of events are used to raise money? Ahead of the Democratic convention Barbra Streisand is holding a fundraising brunch for Bill Clinton's presidential library at her Malibu home, which should raise around $1m. Another fundraising event should bring in $4m for Hilary Clinton's senate campaign. Al Gore expects to make $2.5m from his star-studded convention bash. More dubiously, Al Gore was heavily involved in raising cash for Bill Clinton's campaign in 1996, telephoning key donors from the White House. Where does all the money go? Television advertising swallows the bulk of the cash - in contrast with Britain, candidates are allowed to buy airtime.

Many thousands of young people travel to Thailand and Asia every year, and increasingly, women are travelling alone.</p> <p>Kirsty's fellow backpacker Sarah Wiggett, who had been with her friend the night before she was raped and killed, is also travelling by herself. She told reporters: \"I don't know if I'm going to stay out here now after this.\" Her caution in the light of the terrible fate met by her travelling companion is understandable, but the isolated incident does not mean that in every hostel now lurks a murderer, preying on young single women.</p> <p>Travelling alone in Asia is not an inherently dangerous experience. Eleven years ago, as a fresh-faced 18-year-old who had never been further than Greece, I set off with a girlfriend for Thailand. The first night, jet-lagged and deeply culture-shocked in a hostel on the notorious Khao-San road, I wept as a cockroach glared at me from the dirt-encrusted shower and the paper-thin walls prevented any hope of sleeping. But within a few weeks, we were old hands, happily haggling over a few pence with the tuk-tuk drivers, and sniffing out places to go that, crucially, weren't in the Lonely Planet guide.</p> <p>One element of travelling further afield that can never be emulated in Europe is the ease with which you befriend other travellers. When you're travelling alone, it's almost impossible to actually be alone.</p> <p>Wanting to do and see different things, my friend and I parted company, and arranged to meet several weeks later, in Malaysia. I opted to spend a week in Chiang Mai, the beautiful city in the north of Thailand, where Kirsty Jones was staying.</p> <p>Perhaps if I had chosen that moment to call my parents and gleefully announce \"Guess what, I'm in Chiang Mai. Juliet's in Laos. No, I'm by myself. Don't worry, I'm fine,\" they might very well have worried, but the fact is that every Thai person I came across was welcoming and generous.</p> <p>From hostel staff to waiters and taxi drivers, people were especially careful to make sure I was all right. Although I am wary of making crass generalisations, I felt perfectly safe in Thailand, because its people seemed to me gentle and non-aggressive. I experienced nothing that made me think differently.</p> <p>An integral part of the delight of being in south-east Asia is that the hostels don't have alarms and infra-red security systems, nor front doors with British-standard five-bolt locks. Travellers and locals alike are relaxed and friendly, and there is nothing of the barely suppressed aggression that seems to lurk in so many British cities.</p> <p>In fact, I feel more threatened on my nightly walk home from the tube in south London. And this is the tragedy of Kirsty Jones's death. Police are apparently searching for a British man who had been staying at the same hostel, a man who might well have raped and murdered women in their homes in the UK, or at university halls of residence, or in any holiday resort, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>The evil of her death is nothing to do with Thailand, but a tragic isolated incident. To insist that every hostel steps up its security would be not only impossible, and no more sensible than preventing any young woman from travelling alone.</p> <p>My experience of travelling by myself was, without doubt, the best thing I did that year, if not ever. It gave me an enormous amount of confidence and courage, and I urge every woman to try it themselves, and not succumb to what seems essentially a misogynist hysteria. If a young man had been found murdered, there would be no comment on his travelling companions, or lack of them.</p>",

Travelling alone in Asia is not an inherently dangerous experience. Eleven years ago, as a fresh-faced 18-year-old who had never been further than Greece, I set off with a girlfriend for Thailand. The first night, jet-lagged and deeply culture-shocked in a hostel on the notorious Khao-San road, I wept as a cockroach glared at me from the dirt-encrusted shower and the paper-thin walls prevented any hope of sleeping. But within a few weeks, we were old hands, happily haggling over a few pence with the tuk-tuk drivers, and sniffing out places to go that, crucially, weren't in the Lonely Planet guide. One element of travelling further afield that can never be emulated in Europe is the ease with which you befriend other travellers. When you're travelling alone, it's almost impossible to actually be alone. Wanting to do and see different things, my friend and I parted company, and arranged to meet several weeks later, in Malaysia. I opted to spend a week in Chiang Mai, the beautiful city in the north of Thailand, where Kirsty Jones was staying. Perhaps if I had chosen that moment to call my parents and gleefully announce \"Guess what, I'm in Chiang Mai. Juliet's in Laos. No, I'm by myself. Don't worry, I'm fine,\" they might very well have worried, but the fact is that every Thai person I came across was welcoming and generous. From hostel staff to waiters and taxi drivers, people were especially careful to make sure I was all right. Although I am wary of making crass generalisations, I felt perfectly safe in Thailand, because its people seemed to me gentle and non-aggressive. I experienced nothing that made me think differently. An integral part of the delight of being in south-east Asia is that the hostels don't have alarms and infra-red security systems, nor front doors with British-standard five-bolt locks. Travellers and locals alike are relaxed and friendly, and there is nothing of the barely suppressed aggression that seems to lurk in so many British cities. In fact, I feel more threatened on my nightly walk home from the tube in south London. And this is the tragedy of Kirsty Jones's death. Police are apparently searching for a British man who had been staying at the same hostel, a man who might well have raped and murdered women in their homes in the UK, or at university halls of residence, or in any holiday resort, anywhere in the world. The evil of her death is nothing to do with Thailand, but a tragic isolated incident. To insist that every hostel steps up its security would be not only impossible, and no more sensible than preventing any young woman from travelling alone. My experience of travelling by myself was, without doubt, the best thing I did that year, if not ever. It gave me an enormous amount of confidence and courage, and I urge every woman to try it themselves, and not succumb to what seems essentially a misogynist hysteria. If a young man had been found murdered, there would be no comment on his travelling companions, or lack of them.",

The weather from November to January is usually pleasant enough to hike the excellent trails in the New Territories and on Lantau, or to explore some of the two hundred islands dotted around Hong Kong's territorial waters. </p> <p>The newly-arrived picture Hong Kong as a heaving concrete jungle, heavily polluted and packed with shops, banks and restaurants. And they're right, but luckily escape to the countryside is easy. Sailing, windsurfing, camping, and hiking are all popular leisure pursuits in the Sai Kung Country Park, located in the northeast corner of the New Territories. Birdwatchers rave about the Mai Po Bird Sanctuary near the border with Mainland Chinese and diving and dolphin watching are also possible in the South China Sea. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Hong Kong can be claustrophobic. Many new teachers, especially those with no previous experience in Asia, suffer a certain amount of culture shock due to the fast pace of life, the ever-present construction noise, the jam-packed public transport, and the lack of 'western-style' service in restaurants and shops. But if you don't mind the waiter casually dumping the chopsticks on the table or the shop assistants ignoring you, you'll be fine. The HK Chinese temperament is abrupt and direct; it is easy to mistake this characteristic for rudeness. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"a\"> Role of English</a></strong><br> Hong Kong is officially bilingual, with English and Cantonese as the main languages, and Mandarin as the third. English plays a major part in daily life, especially in business, education, and the law. In fact, since Hong Kong law is based on the British judicial system, cases are still tried in English with the non-English speaking accused relying on translators for information. </p> <p>The role of English in HK society has been the subject of intense debate over the last few years, especially among parents and teachers who believe English-medium schools are more prestigious, even though the use of English might have lowered education standards since many children cannot understand their teachers. When the HK government ordered several English-medium schools to revert to mother tongue education in 1998, the Education Department was flooded with complaints from mothers and fathers demanding that their children be taught in English. However, initial research suggests overall education standards are improving in schools using Cantonese as the medium of instruction. Either way, there is a great demand for qualified and experienced ELT specialists in the SAR. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"b\">Teaching</a></strong><br> There are several options for EFL teachers in Hong Kong. The universities probably offer the best jobs in terms of pay, career prospects and conditions. Salaries start at around GBP 22,000 and can rise to around GBP 60-70 000 for senior teaching staff. Benefits include medical and dental insurance, an average of six weeks paid annual vacation, and access to decent library, sports and eating facilities on campus. Good conditions, though, mean vacancies do not open up very often; when they do, competition is fierce. Jobs are advertised on the universities' homepages, in the <a href=\" http://www.scmp.com/\">South China Morning Post</a>, as well as in various international publications. </p> <p>The Native English Teacher (NET) scheme employs ELT educators for government subsidized schools throughout Hong Kong. The main attraction for teachers is the pay, generous leave, a GBP 1100 a month housing allowance, and a 15% gratuity payable after completing a two-year contract, but the actual conditions are less appealing since there are no realistic prospects of promotion within the system and the teaching itself can be very challenging. </p> <p>One of the problems is many Netters, as they are affectionately known, earn more than their Chinese counterparts, causing some friction and resentment within the staff room. The Netter is sometimes the only <em>gweilo </em> (affectionate Cantonese term for foreigners meaning 'white ghost') in the school and it is not uncommon to feel isolated. An additional problem is that Netters are randomly assigned schools and cannot choose the location or Band. Given a choice, most teachers would opt for either Band 1 or 2, schools for the 'brighter' pupils, because the students there are less likely make your life hell. The same cannot be said for Band 5 schools, which shelter many pupils with discipline and behavioural problems. </p> <p>\"I've had to deal with abusive students, kids that just come in and put their head on their desk and sleep, and very little motivation,\" reports Dan Griffiths, a teacher in a Band 5 secondary school in the New Territories. In contrast, Jane Southurland, an Australian primary school teacher, says \"teaching in the higher banded secondary schools can be rewarding because the kids are more forthcoming.\" It's a bit of a lottery, but if you are patient, tough, and want to pay off your mortgage, the NET scheme is available. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.britcoun.org.uk/\">British Council</a> employs a number of teachers for its adult, children and Business English classes, and runs certificate and diploma courses for teachers at different stages of their careers. </p> <p>International and English Foundation schools are also well respected and offer good conditions to suitably qualified professionals. </p> <p>In addition to teaching, teachers who want to stay in the field but would like to work in another area of ELT can find interesting jobs in the local press. Many of the well-known textbook publishers, such as the OUP and Pearsons, have offices in Hong Kong and occasionally advertise for editors or marketing personnel. Over the last few years, several multimedia companies specializing in the development of educational software and web design have emerged and for the more academically inclined, universities need research assistants to manage research projects. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"c\">Living</a></strong><br> Housing is a perpetual problem for teachers in Hong Kong. While senior staff receive a housing allowance, most English language teachers struggle with high rents for cramped quarters. In centrally located districts such as Midlevels you should expect to pay around GBP 1000 for a habitable 550-700 sq. ft flat; in the cheaper areas requiring a long commute such as Lamma Island or Sai Kung, rents hover around the GBP 600 a month mark for a 700 square foot flat. You'll also need to put down two months' rent as a deposit, pay the property agent 50% of the rent as commission, and buy furniture if you are not keen on the circa1973 kitsch found in many semi-furnished flats. </p> <p>Eating out and drinking in Hong Kong can be fun but expensive. All major cuisine from around the world are represented in the hundred of restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong, Kowloon and Wanchai, as well as some of the less well-known such as Burmese and Nepalese. Cantonese food is very good and Sundays are great for checking out the various dim sum restaurants. And whereas Chinese people are less inclined to drink heavily at the weekends, the western-style bars are crammed full, especially Friday nights during Happy Hours. </p> <p>If you don't drink and you eat at home, Hong Kong is an affordable place to live. Shopping for food is cheap if you stick to the local markets, but if you're squeamish about watching vendors chop off the legs of live frogs or cut open live fish, use the two major supermarket chains, Parknshop and Wellcome, both very affordable. Public transport is easy to use, cheap and clean, and basic utilities such as water, gas and electricity are also reasonable. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"d\"> Points to Remember</a></strong><br> Chinese students are relatively passive when compared to their European or South American counterparts. The secondary school system is exam-oriented and the students are not usually encouraged to be creative or think independently. Students can seem bored, listless, and demotivated, a constant source of frustration for teachers. </p> <p>Hong Kong is very high-tech oriented and teachers should have more than basic computer skills since a lot of communication takes place via the internet and email. </p> <p>The pollution in Hong Kong is not getting any better and despite pressure from environmental groups the government does not appear to be tackling the problem of poor air quality. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"e\"> Useful Contacts</a></strong><br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org.hk\">British Council</a>, 3, Supreme Court Road, Admiralty, Hong Kong.

The <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new&quot;\">ministry of agriculture</a> has confirmed <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/food/Story/0,2763,352454,00.html\">three outbreaks</a> of classical swine fever (CSF) in East Anglia this week, and is taking stern measures to contain the horrible disease.</p> <p>2. CSF, and its equally nasty cousin, <a href=\"http://hoshi.cic.sfu.ca/epix/topics/animal/asf.htm\" target=\"_new\">African swine fever</a>, is a <a href=\"http://www.usaha.org/speeches/speech99/s99griot.html\" target=\"_new\">worldwide scourge</a> for pigs and their keepers.</p> <p>3. The last outbreak of CSV in Britain was 14 years ago. Transmission of the disease is complex, but <a href=\"http://www.aqis.gov.au/docs/schools/rl/8094.htm\" target=\"_new\">careless husbandry</a> is high on the list of causes.</p> <p>4. There is no cure for swine fever. Affected herds have to be slaughtered. On the large-scale European farms, that can be <a href=\"  http://www.africanews.com/monitor/freeissues/24jul99/feature.html#anchor6\" target=\"_new\">devastating</a>.</p> <p>5. In Britain, <a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net/\" target=\"_new\">pig farming</a> is already in deep crisis. Although prices have <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/country/article/0,2763,215433,00.html \"> recovered marginally</a>, the national herd has shrunk by about 20% in recent years (to around 15m) and up to a third of all pig farmers have gone out of business, or are about to.</p> <p>6. The <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers Union</a> recently conducted a <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/pigmill.asp\" target=\"_new\">detailed survey</a> of its pig farming members, with some surprisingly upbeat results. But then <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/pubs/pigs2.asp\" target=\"_new\">the pig sector</a> remains part of the <a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/crisis.asp\" target=\"_new\"> general agricultural recession</a>.</p> <p>7. Unlike some rather dreary modern agri-business sectors, pigs can still arouse passionate enthusiasm. That's <a href=\"http://www.pigsuk.com/piglinks.html\" target=\"_new\">reflected on the net</a>, where there are sites on all manner of porcine affairs, <a href=\"http://www.pighealth.com/\" target=\"_new\">including health</a>.</p> <p>8. There is a growing number of <a href=\"http://www.stockmaster.co.uk/site/herdmaster/pigs/intro.htm\" target=\"_new\">pig fanciers</a> in Britain, and a steadily rising interest in the <a href=\"http://www.farmshop.net/rbst/about.htm\" target=\"_new\">conservation of rare breeds</a>.</p> <p>9. The growth of factory farming has driven many <a href=\"http://www.pigparadise.com/\" target=\"_new\">traditional breeds</a> to the edge of extinction - and in some cases, like the splendid <a href=\"http://www.pigparadise.com/oxford.html\" target=\"_new\">Oxford Sandy and Black</a>, over that edge.

      "bodyText": "1. The ministry of agriculture has confirmed three outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) in East Anglia this week, and is taking stern measures to contain the horrible disease. 2. CSF, and its equally nasty cousin, African swine fever, is a worldwide scourge for pigs and their keepers. 3. The last outbreak of CSV in Britain was 14 years ago. Transmission of the disease is complex, but careless husbandry is high on the list of causes. 4. There is no cure for swine fever. Affected herds have to be slaughtered. On the large-scale European farms, that can be devastating. 5. In Britain, pig farming is already in deep crisis. Although prices have recovered marginally, the national herd has shrunk by about 20% in recent years (to around 15m) and up to a third of all pig farmers have gone out of business, or are about to. 6. The National Farmers Union recently conducted a detailed survey of its pig farming members, with some surprisingly upbeat results. But then the pig sector remains part of the general agricultural recession. 7. Unlike some rather dreary modern agri-business sectors, pigs can still arouse passionate enthusiasm. That's reflected on the net, where there are sites on all manner of porcine affairs, including health. 8. There is a growing number of pig fanciers in Britain, and a steadily rising interest in the conservation of rare breeds. 9. The growth of factory farming has driven many traditional breeds to the edge of extinction - and in some cases, like the splendid Oxford Sandy and Black, over that edge. The good news is that the OSB is being revived from the dead, though some folk are sniffy about them. There is, apropos of nothing, a small herd of them at Dean, near Chipping Norton. 10. Other splendid porkers include the British Lop, the Large Black , the Berkshire, the Saddleback, the Gloucester Old Spot, and the aristocrat of the porcine world, the Tamworth.",

      "bodyText": "Madonna today confirmed she was expecting a baby boy. The superstar, who is eight months pregnant by British director boyfriend Guy Ritchie, has revealed the gender of her unborn child to a Los Angeles-based radio station. But the 41-year-old singer says she is not planning to have the child in Britain - because of the state of UK hospitals. Madonna's exclusive interview with an LA commercial station, recorded yesterday, has been obtained by UK-based Independent Radio Network (IRN). In it, she was asked by an interviewer if she already knows the sex of her child. She replied: \"Of course I know.\" When the interviewer guessed that it might be a boy, she said: \"You are right.\" Asked where she is planning to have her baby, the multimillionairess, who has divided her time between America and London in recent months, said: \"Come on now, have you been to hospitals in England? They're old and Victorian.\" Qualifying her criticism, Madonna said she did not like the thought of the complications caused by giving birth in a foreign country, adding: \"I like efficiency.\" Confirmation of the sex of Madonna's imminent second child follows months of speculation in the media. Madonna, who has been dating Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels director Ritchie for more than a year, had her first child, daughter Lourdes, three and a half years ago. The Department of Health declined to get involved in a row with the pop star, or defend the state of NHS hospitals. A spokesman said simply: \"We wish Madonna well and the very best of luck.\"",

But as long as Anna was OK, he was OK.\"</p> <p>The impending birth - the baby was due on July 17 - had kept the family on tenterhooks for weeks. Several false alarms meant that Martyn and his wife Lin had to abandon plans to watch their son opening the batting in several one-dayers, and they missed his highest England score so far, 87 not out in the 10-wicket victory over West Indies at Chester-le-Street. Mrs Trescothick also opted out of the triangular series final at Lord's, on July 22, because she was convinced their grandchild would arrive that day. </p> <p>However the baby, with a sense of timing which evidently runs in the family, arrived at the ideal time (July 30), midway through a ten-day break in the international schedule.

During the 1930s, when other publishers suffered, Mills &amp; Boon prospered with its then brown-covered hardbacks, designed for the rigours and sensitivities of the circulating- library market. In another unlikely twist, Alan set great store by Percy Lubbock's book, The Craft Of Fiction, which stresses the virtue of telling a story from the heroine's point of view.

The bombing of warehouses in London's Paternoster Row in 1940 destroyed 6m books across the publishing industry, with the result that anything that survived sold out immediately to a book-hungry public. The situation changed with peace, by which time the Boons' father had died. For a while, their firm was caught between the conflicts of an era which was opening up to racier prose, but had to contend with the demands of the lucrative, hidebound Irish market - while trying to reconcile the safe, moderate sale of hardbacks to libraries with the limitless market for cheap paperbacks, and to take advantage of the serial market.</p> <p>Mills &amp; Boon found that such apparent promiscuity worked well in those 3s 6d tales of sweaty rectitude, whose now familiar length and format were drilled upon a benignly-ordered parade ground.

In the 1920s, Denise Robins's Sweet Love had covered all the vices - rape, bigamy, suicide, illegitimacy, divorce, stabbings, poisoning, and more violence, as Joseph McAleer wrote last year in his admirable study of Mills &amp; Boon. Despite the sensibilities of the transatlantic firm, Harlequin, which, in effect, took over the firm in 1971, later romances still found room for such acts as the lonesome heroine Suzy Walker's resorting to that \"solitary, inadequate substitute for the ecstasies of a shared bed\".</p> <p>Boon was always sharp on grammar, detail, and an eye for the future; a reference to a Rolls and the Ritz could stay, as these were likely to be around for some while, but likening a heroine to Vivien Leigh was pencilled out, for she would soon date a book whose potential went far beyond its domestic market to being used as a textbook in former British colonies. Even today, a Chinese interest is taking annual sales beyond the 200m, which they have long enjoyed worldwide.</p> <p>Alan Boon bred racehorses with all the prowess that he brought to novels. He was married for 50 years to Olivia, and had three daughters and a son. They all survive him.</p> <p><b>Alan Wheatley Boon, publisher, born September 28 1913; died July 29 2000</b></p>",

Boon was always sharp on grammar, detail, and an eye for the future; a reference to a Rolls and the Ritz could stay, as these were likely to be around for some while, but likening a heroine to Vivien Leigh was pencilled out, for she would soon date a book whose potential went far beyond its domestic market to being used as a textbook in former British colonies. Even today, a Chinese interest is taking annual sales beyond the 200m, which they have long enjoyed worldwide. Alan Boon bred racehorses with all the prowess that he brought to novels. He was married for 50 years to Olivia, and had three daughters and a son. They all survive him. Alan Wheatley Boon, publisher, born September 28 1913; died July 29 2000",

The library, which under copyright law receives every new book, cleared well over a mile of shelves. The books were chosen and weeded by \"comparatively junior grade professional staff\" to make room for new stock. The new policy, though approved by the library board, has not been publicly announced. Yesterday a library spokesman at first denied that it had been introduced. Later he confirmed it after hearing that a senior staff member had acknowledged its existence in a letter to a scholar. The letter indicated that it had been suspended because of lack of staff to do more weeding. But no assurances could be given that it would not be resumed. The move, which breaks a practice that began in 1662 and made the British Library a near complete historical collection, came to light during inquiries by Keith Armstrong, an author researching a book on the history of disability. Mr Armstrong, who has written or edited four other books, discovered that five books he wanted to read were marked \"discarded\" in the library catalogue. He also found a copy of an important work in his field, by the psychologist Deborah Marks, in a London secondhand bookshop. Though published only last year, it was marked \"British Library - withdrawn\". His protest to the library led to a reply which horrified him, he said yesterday. Richard Cheffins, head of the BL's social policy information service, told him discarding began after the board accepted a 1989 report, headed Selection for Survival, by Brian Enright, librarian of Newcastle University. Dr Enright's report said the steeply rising number of books published meant that the time-honoured policy of storing each one would put an ever-increasing cash burden on the BL and imperil the quality of its collections. Mr Cheffins explained that discarding of low use books began soon after the report was accepted. \"Decisions on a case-by-case basis were made by comparatively junior grade professional staff. \"I am given to understand that, over a couple of years, some 2km of stock in all - about 70,000-80,000 volumes - were withdrawn\", he told Mr Armstrong. \"The space thus freed was filled within a few months with the growth of new stock...

The youth should have been housed on a special juvenile unit which has capacity for 180 under-18s. But last week, there were 280 at the institution.

      "bodyText": "The political row over Britain's membership of the single currency burst into fresh life yesterday when the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota insisted that British suppliers seeking new business would have to trade in euros. The leading Tory eurosceptic John Redwood seized on the Toyota move, accusing the government of getting the motor company to \"do its dirty work for it\" by stepping up the pressure for the UK to enter monetary union. After a summer of cabinet warfare over the single currency, the government yesterday sought to play down the significance of Toyota's decision, taken as a result of the impact of weakness of the euro on cars manufactured in Britain and sold in mainland Europe. The Blairite cabinet office minister, Lord Falconer, stood by Gordon Brown's \"five economic tests\", though he added: \"We in principle think it is a good thing to join the euro if it is in the economic interests of this country.\" The Department of Trade and Industry also played down the symbolic importance of Toyota's move by reminding industry that it had long been encouraging business, especially small and medium sized firms, to start trading in euros if there were sales to be had that way. \"If being able to transact and quote in euros allows you to win more business why let a point of principle stand in your way?\" said one official. In a statement, Toyota said: \"We can confirm we have requested a small number of suppliers to quote for new business in euros rather than sterling.\" It added that it was looking to find ways of cutting costs, although that might include stepping up production at its Derbyshire manufacturing base from last year's 180,000 cars to its full capacity of 220,000 - a move likely to involve extra investment. The Conservative view - that a major player in a troubled sector was simply trying to offload the exchange rate \"risk\" on to its smaller suppliers - was echoed by the lobbying group Business for Sterling, which opposes UK membership of the euro. UK components makers had been bracing themselves for Toyota's initiative, the latest in a series of moves by Japanese companies worried about the high value of the pound at a time when selling cars globally has never been more competitive. After a mini-recovery earlier in the summer, the euro has been on the slide again recently, both against the pound and the US dollar. \"We were warned earlier this year by some big components suppliers that there would soon be a deadline for change from Toyota,\" said Edward Roberts, chairman of the Worcestershire-based firm, Peterson Springs. \"It comes down to a competitive issue, especially with the pound as strong as it is.

Today's Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph confirms the Guardian/ICM findings, and other polls, which suggest that Tory gains during William Hague's spring offensive have proved as ephemeral as jittery ministers hoped. The Gallup poll suggests Labour is now on 47% - up 2% over mid-July - with the Tories down 3% on 32%, and the Liberal Democrats unchanged on 14%. That is enough to allow Labour's election strategists to assume they are on course for a second term, with polling day probably next May or June. But persistent speculation among a few MPs does not rule out that Tony Blair will try to wrongfoot opponents by a snap election in October. Talk of a snap poll this year is offset by two calculations, one that any hint of cut-and-run may reawaken voter fears that Labour is all spin, the other that Mr Blair is going to the country because he shares those doubts.",

The offer came as a British and a Canadian diplomat gained access to the men for the first time, more than a week after their arrest near Montenegro's border with Kosovo. Accompanied by local lawyers, the British envoy, Robert Gordon, and the Canadian charge d'affaires, Craig Bale, visited the men at the military court where they are under preliminary investigation. Mr Gordon said that the two Britons, Detective Sergeant Adrian Prangnell, 41, from Hampshire, and PC John Yore, 31, from Cambridgeshire were \"fine and in good health\". The two Canadians, Shaun Going and his nephew Liam Hall, were also reported to be in a satisfactory condition. \"They are healthy, they've been well treated and we were able to discuss their detention with them,\" said Mr Bale. \"We are hopeful ... that they will be released as soon as possible.\" The Yugoslav army detained the four last week after allegedly finding de-mining and explosives-related material in their car. They have not yet been formally charged. During a court hearing on Wednesday all four men denied any wrongdoing. UN officials in Kosovo - where the four worked - maintain that they were returning from a brief holiday when captured. If tried and convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison. Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian foreign ministry spokesman, told the Guardian last night that the Kremlin would react \"positively\" to British requests for it to use its influence in Belgrade to free the men. Earlier the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, told his Canadian counterpart, Lloyd Axworthy, that Moscow wanted the legal status of international organisations in Yugoslavia defined swiftly, so that employees of international agencies there could enjoy immunity from arrest and prosecution. The detained men were working in Kosovo for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Earlier this week, British MPs called on Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to intervene with Mr Milosevic to have the men released. An aide to Mr Putin said the Russian president took a dim view of all \"international hostage-taking\", but declined to say whether Mr Putin had contacted the Yugoslav leader. Yesterday's moves by the Russian foreign ministry were the first signs of Moscow's intervention. Following a phone conversation with Mr Ivanov, Mr Axworthy said Moscow had agreed \"to offer Russian assistance\" in Belgrade. He added that the Russian ambassador \"is very well regarded''.

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3160m earmarked for hospital equipment in Scotland over the last five years has been diverted to reduce NHS trust budget deficits, it emerged yesterday. According to figures compiled by the Scottish National party, \u00a3165m of capital funds allocated for equipment was transferred to revenue budgets between 1995 and this year, a time when the medical profession had increasingly been warning of the problems caused by a lack of equipment, and outdated machines. One doctor has revealed that his department resorted to getting parts from a scrap yard to keep old equipment in use. The SNP said the practice of diverting funds was known about and sanctioned by the Scottish executive and the Scottish Office before it. The Scottish executive said it has now been banned and money allocated for new equipment cannot be spent elsewhere. Using parliamentary questions, the SNP said it had discovered that in Glasgow alone, a city with one of the poorest health records in the UK, \u00a321m had been moved from capital to revenue budgets. \"We have had all this hype about new money here, there and everywhere,\" said the nationalist Glasgow MSP Kenneth Gibson. \"But the NHS has been drained of resources, especially for equipment.

He met health and safety executive officials following a sharp rise in the number of construction workers killed as routine inspections drop. Over the past 12 months there have been 79 deaths in construction, up from 65, against the national trend in workplace accidents. Construction accounts for a third of work deaths. In May three men were killed in a crane accident in east London. Unions say the number of inspectors has fallen by 40% since 1992. They want increased fines and an offence of corporate negligence.",

      "bodyText": "The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Elizabeth Filkin, is cracking down on outside speaking engagements by leading MPs such as Charles Kennedy and Michael Portillo because she is determined to prevent speech fees being used to circumvent the rules on members interests. She wants to stop money owed for less innocent services being \"laundered'' as fees for speeches - as happened in Washington DC until the practice was banned. In what looked to some MPs like a tit for tat exchange, Mr Portillo's availibility to speak for up to \u00a35,000 was revealed by a Labour MP days after a Conservative colleague had shone a similar spotlight on Mr Kennedy - who vigorously denied any impropriety. There is no suggestion that the Liberal Democrat leader or the shadow chancellor has done anything wrong in failing to make more explicit declarations of after-dinner speeches. It seems likely they failed to understand what is now expected of them. Nor did the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, nor John Major, the former Tory prime minister, whose speech-making have also fallen foul of Mrs Filkin's investigations this year. In 18 months before he was elected mayor Mr Livinstone earned \u00a3220,992 from speech making, including \u00a3158,000 not included in the members' register. Now any speech which earns an MP more than \u00a3500 should be itemised. Some 208 MPs list \"occasional'' fees for speeches, journalism or broadcasting. All may have to check their records, MPs were advised in June. Some have been slow to respond. \"When in doubt consult and register,'' the independent MP, Martin Bell, said last night. Mrs Filkin, who succeeded Sir Gordon Downey as Westminster's independent watchdog on parliamentary ethics - a byproduct of Lord Nolan's anti-sleaze inquiry - is determined that MPs who make such outside speeches more than three times a year using a professional agency should register their employment agreement and the fee. The reasoning behind the move, which is subject to oversight by the Commons standards and privileges committee, stems from US experience which led to all \"honoraria'' for speeches or guest appearances being banned a decade ago. In a series of cases, including that of Jim Wright of Texas, speaker of the house of representatives, US congressmen were found to be taking fees for speeches which were, in reality, covert payments for consultancies and similar services. In effect, payments were being \"laundered'' despite 20 years of ever-tighter efforts to clean up US politics, which is money-driven because candidates are obliged to buy costly television advertisements. A ban on speaker's fees was therefore imposed, though members of congress are allowed to nominate a charity to which up to $2,000 (around \u00a31,300) can be given, provided the senate or house member does not benefit directly and that the money is not sent to the charity via the politician. Unlike \"cash for questions'' and other unsavoury conduct unearthed at Westminster, no evidence exists for similar tactics being deployed in Britain. But it has made MPs and officials sensitive to the danger. Rules designed to oblige MPs to register outside consultancies also are written so as to require them to register employment agreements with the speakers' agencies who provide after dinner stars. With most MPs away from Westminster, Mrs Filkin has not spoken either to Mr Kennedy or Mr Portillo. But colleagues argued that the speakers' agency was \"acting for me'' in fixing up a speech -rather than the other way round, as when an MP acted in parliament on behalf of a consultancy client.

Should they fail, the centre, which had an initial budget of \u00a3350m, may have to push back its scheduled opening date of January 2002, causing costs to soar.</p> <p>The extent of the problem was unearthed by the magazine Computer Weekly, which has been a vociferous critic of the centre's system since problems first emerged in 1994. Thousands of bugs were initially uncovered, with 1,400 still existing in 1999, and 500 in May this year. Tony Collins, an executive editor at the magazine, said there was now a low to medium risk that the centre - due to control most of the airspace above England and Wales - would not open on schedule.</p> <p>\"Any one of these bugs that affects safety has the potential to delay the programme because Nats [the national air traffic services, which control Britain's airspace] won't compromise on safety,\" he said.</p> <p>\"On a positive note, they have cleared up many of the problems, but to some extent the bugs they have identified are less serious than the ones they haven't yet identified.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a3623m air traffic control centre which has already been held back for six years is in danger of being further delayed because 200 computer bugs still plague its software, it emerged yesterday. Three hundred IT experts are racing against the clock to iron out glitches before safety inspectors assess the centre's system at Swanwick, Hampshire, in December this year. Should they fail, the centre, which had an initial budget of \u00a3350m, may have to push back its scheduled opening date of January 2002, causing costs to soar. The extent of the problem was unearthed by the magazine Computer Weekly, which has been a vociferous critic of the centre's system since problems first emerged in 1994. Thousands of bugs were initially uncovered, with 1,400 still existing in 1999, and 500 in May this year. Tony Collins, an executive editor at the magazine, said there was now a low to medium risk that the centre - due to control most of the airspace above England and Wales - would not open on schedule. \"Any one of these bugs that affects safety has the potential to delay the programme because Nats [the national air traffic services, which control Britain's airspace] won't compromise on safety,\" he said. \"On a positive note, they have cleared up many of the problems, but to some extent the bugs they have identified are less serious than the ones they haven't yet identified. This is a piece of software with 2m lines of code and there are still some upgrades of software they need to do. With a system of this size, there could still be huge problems.\" Faults have included a problem with communication links between Swanwick and the ageing London air traffic control centre at West Drayton, most of whose work it will take over. There has also been a big problem involving back-up power supplies that would keep Swanwick's 200 controller work stations running in an emergency. In tests, up to 60% of the work stations failed instead of the anticipated 25%. \"That was an unacceptably high failure rate,\" admitted Richard Wright, a spokesman for Nats. \"But we have acquired an additional, fifth, power supply, to preserve the level of service.\" Nats, which is expected to be partly privatised before the Swanwick centre is opened, last night said that it was confident that it would meet its technical handover date in December, when the system will be ready for air traffic controllers to spend a year training. \"There's still a lot to do but the fact that we're down to this number of so-called bugs now is extremely good news for us\", said its chief executive, Bill Semple. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he insisted that no bugs would affect its operation. \"I can absolutely assure anybody... that there will be no compromises made that will impact on safety. If there are any doubts on that account I can assure you that I will not take this system into operation,\" he said.",

Total emissions from aviation are small in comparison to those from private cars or power stations, but they are growing. As Ben Rogers complained on these pages on Monday, as well as carbon dioxide, planes emit nitrogen oxides, which may also be contributing to climate change. Even the water vapour trails that cut across our skies are, at that altitude, a greenhouse gas.</p> <p>UN scientists recommend greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by at least 60% in the next 50 years in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But fuel used for aviation is exempt by international treaty from any form of tax. There are no regulations on efficiency of aircraft engines. Although there have been improvements in their fuel efficiency, these have been outstripped by growth in demand for air travel. Emissions from international flights are not even subject to the Kyoto protocol, which set legally binding targets for developed countries to cut greenhouse gases.</p> <p>The climate, so to speak, is changing. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is due to report to the UN framework convention on climate change in autumn next year. The European Parliament is backing proposals for a charge on aviation emissions and the UK government is to set out its thoughts in a white paper within the next couple of years. So far, the airlines have offered voluntary improvements. The government will need to be wary. It is still thrashing out agreements with industrial firms wanting reductions in their obligations under the climate change levy. These were supposed to be finalised over a year ago. Besides, such voluntary initiatives suffer from lack of transparency. They cannot be enforced and create no incentives for companies to strive for improvements beyond the minimum.</p> <p>The solution, Ben Rogers argued, has to be punitive taxes. There are precedents: most other forms of transport routinely pay either charges or taxes that take their pollution into account. What would the Automobile Association give for a version of the treaties that protect aviation from fuel taxation? In 1996, the Tory environment secretary, John Gummer, backed calls for a global aviation fuel tax to tackle climate change. This remains official policy. But there are problems. Such a tax would require international agreement, not just on the principle but on the mechanism by which such a tax could be put into effect and on the use to which any revenues were put. Given the sort of rows we have in the EU about allowing Brussels to exercise fiscal powers, it seems unlikely an aviation tax would ever be feasible worldwide.</p> <p>A much better prospect is emissions-trading, for which the Kyoto protocol did create a legal framework. The concept is as follows. Countries or industries are allocated a certain number of permits to emit (pollute). The total number of permits is fixed and declines over a set period. The permits then become a tradeable commodity, so if it is cheaper to reduce emissions in a part of the economy other than their own, companies can buy permits from there. The price of permits should reflect the lowest cost of delivering cuts in emissions across all those involved. The aim is to give governments maximum certainty over total emissions and give business maximum flexibility in delivering the reductions.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide emissions from international flights are so far not controlled by Kyoto, so as things stand could not participate in emissions trading. Domestic flying could. Emissions from a flight from, say, London to Edinburgh are part of the UK's total allocation of emissions, which are subject to the legally binding reduction target. Emissions from a flight between London and New York do not count in either UK or American totals. This anomaly has to be addressed. If international aviation were included in the Kyoto totals, it would be subject to a 5% reduction from 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>Of course, such an allocation to international aviation would almost certainly not cover requirements if the projections for passenger growth are to be believed. This is where trading comes in. If the airlines wanted to emit more than their allocated permits allowed, extra would have to be purchased from elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "Flying by plane produces more greenhouse gases for every kilometre each passenger travels than other forms of transport. Total emissions from aviation are small in comparison to those from private cars or power stations, but they are growing. As Ben Rogers complained on these pages on Monday, as well as carbon dioxide, planes emit nitrogen oxides, which may also be contributing to climate change. Even the water vapour trails that cut across our skies are, at that altitude, a greenhouse gas. UN scientists recommend greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut by at least 60% in the next 50 years in order to prevent dangerous climate change. But fuel used for aviation is exempt by international treaty from any form of tax. There are no regulations on efficiency of aircraft engines. Although there have been improvements in their fuel efficiency, these have been outstripped by growth in demand for air travel. Emissions from international flights are not even subject to the Kyoto protocol, which set legally binding targets for developed countries to cut greenhouse gases. The climate, so to speak, is changing. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is due to report to the UN framework convention on climate change in autumn next year. The European Parliament is backing proposals for a charge on aviation emissions and the UK government is to set out its thoughts in a white paper within the next couple of years. So far, the airlines have offered voluntary improvements. The government will need to be wary. It is still thrashing out agreements with industrial firms wanting reductions in their obligations under the climate change levy. These were supposed to be finalised over a year ago. Besides, such voluntary initiatives suffer from lack of transparency. They cannot be enforced and create no incentives for companies to strive for improvements beyond the minimum. The solution, Ben Rogers argued, has to be punitive taxes. There are precedents: most other forms of transport routinely pay either charges or taxes that take their pollution into account. What would the Automobile Association give for a version of the treaties that protect aviation from fuel taxation? In 1996, the Tory environment secretary, John Gummer, backed calls for a global aviation fuel tax to tackle climate change. This remains official policy. But there are problems. Such a tax would require international agreement, not just on the principle but on the mechanism by which such a tax could be put into effect and on the use to which any revenues were put. Given the sort of rows we have in the EU about allowing Brussels to exercise fiscal powers, it seems unlikely an aviation tax would ever be feasible worldwide. A much better prospect is emissions-trading, for which the Kyoto protocol did create a legal framework. The concept is as follows. Countries or industries are allocated a certain number of permits to emit (pollute). The total number of permits is fixed and declines over a set period. The permits then become a tradeable commodity, so if it is cheaper to reduce emissions in a part of the economy other than their own, companies can buy permits from there. The price of permits should reflect the lowest cost of delivering cuts in emissions across all those involved. The aim is to give governments maximum certainty over total emissions and give business maximum flexibility in delivering the reductions. Carbon dioxide emissions from international flights are so far not controlled by Kyoto, so as things stand could not participate in emissions trading. Domestic flying could. Emissions from a flight from, say, London to Edinburgh are part of the UK's total allocation of emissions, which are subject to the legally binding reduction target. Emissions from a flight between London and New York do not count in either UK or American totals. This anomaly has to be addressed. If international aviation were included in the Kyoto totals, it would be subject to a 5% reduction from 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012. Of course, such an allocation to international aviation would almost certainly not cover requirements if the projections for passenger growth are to be believed. This is where trading comes in. If the airlines wanted to emit more than their allocated permits allowed, extra would have to be purchased from elsewhere. The airlines (and therefore air passengers) would collectively pay for emissions-reduction somewhere else in the world to compensate for those created by flying. This would implement the polluter-pays principle in such a way that those responsible for pollution paid only the lowest reasonable price. Getting agreement along these lines would take time but would be easier than attempting to legislate a global aviation tax. The UK could even lead the way by including domestic aviation in its own emissions-trading scheme, which is now under construction. To avoid unfair treatment, airlines that accepted fixed permit allocations and participated in emissions-trading could be exempted from air passenger duty for domestic flights. All sectors will have to do their bit to ameliorate climate change - including the airlines that fly between nations and the passengers who use them.

      "bodyText": "The centuries-old debate over the authenticity of the Turin Shroud, one of the most controversial religious relics in the world, is about to be revived 12 years after scientists thought they had proved it to be a mediaeval forgery. A new book claims that the 4.2 metre (14ft) length of linen in which the body of Christ was supposedly wrapped after his crucifixion bears the seeds of plants once growing in Palestine and fragments of wood, blood, muscle tissue and even nasal stains. If the cloth did once wrap the body of Christ, we may now know what his blood group was: AB, rare among Europeans but much more common among Middle Eastern Jews. The authors argue that the shadowy negative image of a man's body, bearing wounds similar to those recorded in the Gospels, is much more sophisticated than a 13th century forger could have accomplished. The Turin Shroud: the Illustrated Evidence, by the veteran British shroudologist Ian Wilson and an American Jewish photographer, Barrie Schwortz, argues that the Catholic church should allow new tests. The authors, drawing on the evidence of scientists from around the world, claim that the snippets of cloth used in carbon dating tests in the 1980s were affected by a layer of microbiological contamination, possibly because they came from the edge of the shroud, which was often handled by mediaeval bishops. The claims and counterclaims have had little effect on pilgrims, who are expected to turn up in their thousands this weekend when the shroud goes on display in Turin cathedral for two months as part of the Catholic church's millennium celebrations. Although venerated for centuries, the possibility of authentication did not emerge until 1898, when it was first photographed, and again in the 1930s, when negatives showed the startling image of a naked, bearded man.

SmithKline Beecham was judged by analysts to be the most affected by the news. Not only will its leading anti-depressant drug Paxil be exposed to cheap, generic Prozac earlier than expected, but uncertainty will now surround its second patent on antibiotic Augmentin.

Investors singled out Alliance &amp; Leicester - down 18.5p to 511.5p - as being too small to be of any interest to the larger players. The takeover favourite now appears to be the larger Abbey National, up 1p to 755p. Meanwhile the \"arbs\" - the professional punters who try to take bets on differences between share prices - had their fingers crossed that nothing would happen to make the deal between Woolwich and Barclays Bank fall apart at the last minute. In great quantities they have been ploughing into Woolwich stock and getting out of Barclays as this is proving the cheapest way to get a slice of the Barclays action. </p> <p>\u0095 If the deal fails a number of major hedge funds would be likely to suffer. One stock already in pain was internet service provider Freeserve, which fell 13.75p to 276p after report that German firm T-Online is no longer interested in buying it. The news dragged Dixons, which retains an 80.1% stake in Freeserve, 8p lower to 260.5p. </p> <p>\u0095 Takeover speculation continued around business services group Hays, up 9p to 401p, and Marconi, 33p up at \u00a310.88, with Cisco Systems the name being touted by dealers.

According to the City gossips, Mr Hogan is expected to use his experience of the international oil industry to help fast track Bula's negotiations in its target exploration and development areas of Libya and Iraq, and discussions with potential strategic partners. Bula has been in talks with oil group Oilinvest since last October. Speculation was that Bula's discussions in Libya are going so well that it has taken 30,000 square feet of office space in Tripoli.

We are doing this today so that the dramatic history we have lived through isn't repeated,\" President Alfonso Portillo said on Wednesday. Among the cases are two army massacres, in which more than 300 peasants were killed. An attempt by President Portillo to establish a national day for human rights victims was blocked earlier this year by congressmen from his own rightwing party, led by the former president, General Efrain Rios Montt, whose 1982-83 regime oversaw some of the worst abuses of the conflict that left an estimated 200,000 dead.",

Room 101 9pm, BBC2 Former England manager Terry Venables chooses his pet hates, and enjoys himself as he nominates \"uninformed journalists\", people who disguise their background, football club chairmen and cyclists. But as ever, it's host Paul Merton who's the true star of the show. Looking back at when El Tel-managed Gary Lineker, the footballer turned They Think It's All Over panellist, Merton asks: \"Were you aware he was such a funny man?\" Badger 9.30pm, BBC1 The eco-friendly cop drama starring Jerome Flynn (Soldier, Soldier) might have migrated from Sunday to Friday, but that doesn't mean it's got any better. Tonight, McCabe and Claire (Rebecca Lacey) hunt for the organisers of a cock-fighting syndicate. A series where characterisation comes a poor second to contriving a plot that involves cute critters.",

      "bodyText": "A young victim of motor neurone disease was yesterday granted his wish to be allowed to die when he loses his final means of communication - the blinking of his left eye. The 19-year-old man has indicated to doctors and carers by a tiny \"yes or no\" movement of his eyelid that he wants his artificial ventilation turned off if he loses all ability to communicate with the world around him. He has asked doctors to wait for two weeks to make sure his ability to make contact does not return. A high court family division judge in London yesterday granted doctors a declaration that they will not be acting unlawfully in withdrawing life support from the man, referred to only as \"AK\", so that his illness can take its inevitable course. Mr Justice Hughes said it would, in fact, be unlawful not to respect his wishes. The judge heard that AK, born in February 1981, was a normal youngster until he was struck down by the disease in 1998. MND was extremely rare in one so young. The usual cause of death was respiratory failure. Although a cure was likely to be found in the future, it was extremely unlikely to reverse existing damage. After losing his ability to speak and most of his physical movements, AK was reduced to eye movement and operating a computer with his big toe. He then lost eye and toe movement. Within a few weeks from now, the power to move his left eyelid would cease, leaving him \"locked into\" his body, totally unable to communicate. The hospital trust responsible for AK, who is being looked after at home by his mother and carers with the support of his father and the guidance of doctors, had sought a court ruling because the doctor in charge of his case had been given conflicting advice on whether it would be legal to allow him to die. AK was unusual among MND patients in that he had been kept on artificial ventilation since a breathing tube was inserted at a time when doctors were unsure about the nature of his illness. The judge said that he was satisfied that AK had clearly and independently indicated that he no longer wished to be kept alive once his last means of communication had gone.",

      "body": "<p>Stuart Neame is a very angry brewer. The deputy chairman of Shepherd Neame, the Kent real ale specialist, is waging a highly personal war on the great British pastime of \"booze cruising\".</p> <p>A dapper, Rugby-educated 54-year-old, Neame is an unlikely crusader. However, he is deeply worried that his family business is under threat - the cross-Channel drinks trade is wrecking trade at Shepherd Neame's south-eastern pubs. </p> <p>Neame has a taste for confrontation - he likes to meet the enemy face-to-face on \"reconnaissance\" visits to the cavernous, cut-price drinks warehouses of Calais. He invited the Guardian on one of his regular excursions to France, in an attempt to expose the organised world of the \"white van men\".</p> <p>Standing in the morning sunshine in the car park of Dover's Eastern Docks, Neame looks around furtively. He is watching for suspects. \"They don't use white vans any more,\" he says. \"They became too conspicuous, so the professionals switched to coloured vans. Customs are on to that too, though, so most these days use open-backed trucks or estate cars.\" A few battered Toyota Landcruisers attract his attention but he concedes that 10am is hardly peak time for smugglers, most of whom cross at night. An hour later, Neame is snuggling into a sofa in the executive lounge of one of P&amp;O's ferries. The lounge is almost empty - few business travellers use the ferries these days - but Neame dislikes mixing with the shell-suited masses on his reconnaisance missions. Sipping a complimentary coffee, he outlines his case: \"Our Kent pubs have lost a quarter of their business because of imported beer from Calais. Traditional farmworkers and locals used to go to the pub five or six times a week. Now they have a stock of cheap beer at home and drink it in front of the television.\"</p> <p>The law allows travellers within the European Union to bring back as many drinks as they like for personal consumption. A benchmark has been set, however, of 110 litres of beer, or 90 litres of wine. Above that level, Customs can ask questions - and the easiest way to answer them is to prove that you are having a party. Neame says it is common practice for the professionals to make fake bookings for \"wedding parties\" at church halls, to show customs as evidence that their hoards are for personal use. \"It's incredible, the lengths they go to,\" he says.</p> <p>Arriving in Calais, the first stop is EastEnders - one of the largest and best known of the Calais booze emporiums. Located on the town's ringroad, EastEnders is the size of an aircraft hangar, with sawdust on the floor and forklift trucks shuttling around crates of lager. EastEnders is owned by Dave West, a burly character who styles himself as the consumer's champion against rip-off Britain. Neame and West make an odd couple and there is obvious tension between them - West is in the process of suing Shepherd Neame, which is trying to stop him selling its beer. \"I'm a firm believer that duty should be put down,\" says West. \"I'm doing all I can to ensure people break the law - like they did with the poll tax.\" West's top selling lines include crates of cheap French wine packaged as \"The Dog's Bollocks\". He has just branched out into washing powder - Persil, apparently, is much cheaper in France than in Britain. \"I'm after a knighthood,\" announces West. \"Freddie Laker got a knighthood for getting air fares down. I'm doing what I can to get taxes down.\"</p> <p> Neame is unimpressed, and the pair launch into a debate in the middle of the shop floor. West says: \"You'd do more by selling your beers in Calais than by launching a \u00a36m advertising campaign. You're a little old country brewer and you'd have products all over the country if you let us sell them.\" Customers push trolleys around the warehouse with tottering stacks of boxes, containing enough booze for a royal wedding. So, does West really believe his customers are buying purely for personal consumption? His response is to walk up to a woman wheeling a tottering stack of 400 bottles of lager through the checkout, and demand: \"Are you going to drink all that, love?\" \"Of course,\" she replies, with the usual line: \"I'm having a huge party.\" </p> <p>Outside EastEnders, two men are loading up a brand new car. Robert, a decorators' merchant, and Dave, a retired firemen, are on the continent for two days. They have bought a car, a crateload of cigarettes from Belgium (the tobacco trade is far more liberal there than in France) and a boot-load of wine. \"A job well done,\" they conclude - their total saving runs to several thousand of pounds. Next stop is Tesco - a store little more than the size of two tennis courts in one of Calais' out-of-town shopping arcades. The manager, Matt Collins, is described as \"president directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of Tesco France\" - although his responsibilities amount to one store. Collins says business has surged since the introduction of a new Eurotunnel offer - vehicles travelling to Calais after 6pm pay just \u00a312 for a return ticket. Hardened alcohol traffickers have been known to travel there and back three times a night. On its best day, Tesco's Calais store clocked up sales of \u00a3560,000 and typically the shop accounts for about 15% of the Tesco group's entire revenue from wines and spirits. Collins reckons that means the store supplies nearly 4% of all the wines and spirits consumed in Britain. </p> <p>So how does he feel about putting Shepherd Neame's pubs out of business? \"If it's keeping people home from the pub, then personally I would feel maybe a little bit guilty. But business is business.\" Collins says Tesco does what it can to put off professional traffickers, who are likely to sell on their purchases. One customer asked for 40 cases of Bacardi, which the store supplied. But when the same man returned the following week for another 40 cases, Collins refused. \"Morally, I won't sell in that kind of situation,\" he says.</p> <p> Leaving Tesco, Neame follows a home-made sign off the ringroad to another booze warehouse. This one is located down a dirt track, just outside a tatty village, and the prices are even lower. The place is clearly not aimed at holidaymakers - it consists of several warehouses large enough for lorries to enter, and the prices are given in crates, rather than bottles. We are watched suspiciously by staff as we wander around. The brewers are fighting back; the Independent Family Brewers of Britain organises regular watches of Dover docks, to look out for overloaded cars and vans sagging unusually low over their wheels. Neame says accidents are common because some drivers adjust the suspension from their vehicles to fit more booze in, making them more difficult to steer.</p> <p> However, the problem is not going to disappear. Customs reckons \u00a3215m of revenue was lost to Britain through alcohol smuggling last year. The future looks bright for EastEnders. </p> <p> <strong>In the van of the battle</strong> On the front line in the war against smugglers are several thousand \"excise verification officers\", customs officials with the task of stopping and searching suspicious vehicles. They can only hope to make a modest impact: they are pitched against an estimated 27,000 people involved in smuggling. Of the 1.4m pints of beer brought across the Channel every day, 75% is destined for illegal resale. A customs spokeswoman says: \"Our job is to pull people over, question them and try to establish whether their hoards are for personal use.\" If vehicles are carrying more than the \"statutory limit\" of 800 cigarettes and 110 litres of beer, drivers will be asked for evidence that they are planning a party or special event. Customs keeps an eye out for vans which have been across the Channel several times a day. </p> <p>The thin blue line was strengthened recently by more money from the Treasury. The March Budget committed \u00a3209m for recruitment of 1,000 officers. Overseeing all is the former Barclays Bank chief Martin Taylor, the government's unofficial \"smuggling tsar\". Measures to deter smuggling are increasingly imaginative. One recent initiative was to punish newsagents selling bootleg beer and tobacco by taking away their National Lottery machines, often the most lucrative part of their business. </p> <p>The chase extends beyond Channel ports. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association reckons about 15% of white vans head straight for the Midlands, with 4,000 a year targeting Birmingham.

      "bodyText": "For the Halo Trust, a British based charity, yesterday's allegations by the Russians that four of its workers had been spying while in Chechnya were an unwelcome distraction from its mine clearing around the world. The trust had gained little public attention until the publicity generated by Princess Diana's campaign against landmines shone a light on the work it had been carrying out. The cameras and attention followed the princess to Huambo in Angola where she went in 1997 in support of the Red Cross campaign against mines. She picked her way through a minefield and the world saw this glamorous woman watching personnel from the Halo Trust clearing the topsoil to reveal the mines that had left Angola a wreck of walking wounded after a bitter civil war. Last year the Diana, Princess of Wales, memorial fund gave the Halo Trust a \u00a3153,000 grant for its work in two war-ravaged areas, Cambodia and Afghanistan. Shelley-Anne Claircourt, a spokeswoman for the fund, last night paid this tribute to the mine clearance charity: \"The Halo Trust has a fine track record in clearing land mines, which is why we supported them.\" It was founded in 1988 by Colin \"Mad Mitch\" Mitchell. His nickname came from the conflict in Aden in 1967. After leaving the army, Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell became a Tory MP and served as parliamentary private secretary to the secretary of state for Scotland in the Heath government. He set up Halo, which stands for \"hazardous areas life-support organisation\", after several forays into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. Together with another former British army officer, Guy Willoughby, Mr Mitchell made Halo the largest mine-clearing charity in the world. He died four years ago. Halo has conducted mine clearance operations in Angola, Mozambique, Cambodia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Balkans, as well as having an office in Abkhazia, the breakaway part of Georgia which borders Chechnya on the south. Halo operates across nine countries and has 3,000 people defusing mines, most of whom are locals. Halo's de-miners face dangers on top of those posed by mines exploding and injuring them. In June, John Fulford of Halo was released after being abducted in the remote Georgian region of Abkhazia. Rebels seeking independence had demanded a ransom of \u00a3180,000, but his freedom came without this being paid. The allegations that four of the trust's staff were spies were dismissed by fellow charity workers. Last night aid workers with experience of the dangerous conditions in Chechnya rallied to Halo's defence. They praised the trust's professionalism and courage in conducting mine clearance operations that no one else would take on. \"The Halo Trust did a very good job in Chechnya,'' said Mary Wareham, of Human Rights Watch in Washington. \"They were working there at a time when no other organisation was prepared to, carrying out work which was essential.'' Chris Hunter, director of the centre for peacemaking and community development, which operates in Chechnya, said that Halo was the only agency working in Chechnya with the skills needed to carry out mine-clearing. \"It was obviously a high-risk situation which was inevitably going to lead to problems with the Russian authorities,'' he said. One aid worker said innocent actions by the Halo team could have been misconstrued by the Russians. \"Mine clearing is a sensitive area,'' said the official. \"The way groups like this defuse mines is to gather a lot of them together and trigger a controlled explosion. You can see how this might be twisted and described as training people in explosives. They also have to make detailed maps of the mined areas and have a good database of information about the region. This could also be twisted and described as surveillance.'' Russian planes showered mines on Chechnya during its attacks on the rebellious region, and have mined areas surrounding military installations. Halo said it recorded 296 mined areas in Chechnya after the 1994-96 war, and said these were frightening refugees from returning home. \"We then stopped mine clearing when the Russians started the war again in Chechnya. But the Russians fired rockets into the minefields and killed three of our de-miners, and four of our de-miners also died in a Russian rocket attack,\" Mr Willoughby said yesterday. Halo receives money from governments, including those of Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Britain, as well as from the United Nations. It latest accounts lodged with Companies House show that in 1998-99 it had an income of \u00a38.7m, made a loss of \u00a381,000, and held assets of \u00a34m, mostly in cash.

The 38,000-seater Sportcity stadium in east Manchester will cost far more than the projected \u00a391m and will \"struggle to complete on programme\", according to a confidential report for building contractor Taylor Woodrow by Bill Reid, a stadium design specialist. The report, leaked to the trade journal Construction News, said the city council had \"seriously undervalued\" the costs of the giant stadium. The Sportcity stadium, which will house four separate sports venues, is intended to host athletics events during the games as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. From 2003, it is expected to become home for Manchester City football club, currently based in Maine Road. But the project has been beset by contractual problems, with the first contractor, Amec, quitting after six months amid disputes with Manchester council over costs. Building contractor Laing has since taken over construction, but has yet to reach an agreement with the council on the eventual bill. The report - commissioned two years ago by Taylor Woodrow, which lost a bid to build the stadium - singles out for criticism the complexity of the stadium's dramatic cantilevered steel roof, supported by a network of cables suspended from a dozen 60-metre steel masts. \"A saving of at least \u00a33m to \u00a35m should be achieved by simplifying the roof structure,\" wrote Mr Reid, of the Thorburn Colquhoun design consultancy.

He had misjudged a narrow harbour channel.</p> <p>A lifeboat was sent to assist him in the Rhyl estuary after he made yet another SOS call. The lifeboat crew spent more than an hour refloating his vessel.</p> <p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution condemned his irresponsible attitude. \"He should be made aware that the RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and the volunteer crews go out in their own time,\" said Michael Vlasto, chief of operations. \"Putting volunteers' lives at risk in this way is unforgiveable.\"</p> <p>But an unrepentant Mr Abbott said: \"It was a bit hair-raising. But I am thick-skinned.\"</p> <p>He said it was \"absolute rubbish\" to suggest that he had been irresponsible.</p> <p>Ray Carson, deputy district controller at Holyhead Coastguard, expressed relief that he had taken up the offer of the Royal Yachting Association's basic navigation course.</p> <p>\"We are delighted that the Royal Yachting Association has made such a generous offer,\" he said. \"We have every sympathy for Mr Abbott's predicament and we wish to help him in any way practicable.\"</p> <p>Mr Abbott denied that he had been a menace to the coastguard service. \"My boat is seaworthy but if you come to a point in the dark and it isn't easy to see your way, then you need help. That's the job of the RNLI,\" he said.</p> <p>Penny Haire, the RYA's chief cruising instructor, said the course, which normally costs \u00a3500, would teach Mr Abbott to be aware of his limitations and have a healthy respect for the sea.</p> <p>It would also give him an understanding of navigation and improve his boat handling ability.</p> <p>The course will include five days of theory where he will learn charting skills and a further five days of intensive practical training.</p> <p>No doubt the coastguard and lifeboat crews will breathe a collective sigh of relief when he finishes it.</p>",

Eric Abbott, 56, who had previously used only AA road maps to navigate the Irish Sea, cost an estimated \u00a355,000 in coastguard and lifeboat bills in the past year. Although he claims to have gone to sea to find himself, he tends to frequently get lost and has acquired the moniker of Captain Calamity. The retired painter, from Northwich, Cheshire, once told a coastguard watch manager that he could see the Welsh hills when he was actually off the coast of Northern Ireland. The offer of a free basic navigation course was made yesterday morning by the Royal Yachting Association shortly after Mr Abbott caused more problems for the coastguard when he ran aground in his 24ft boat Plus Vat off Rhyl. He had misjudged a narrow harbour channel. A lifeboat was sent to assist him in the Rhyl estuary after he made yet another SOS call. The lifeboat crew spent more than an hour refloating his vessel. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution condemned his irresponsible attitude. \"He should be made aware that the RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and the volunteer crews go out in their own time,\" said Michael Vlasto, chief of operations. \"Putting volunteers' lives at risk in this way is unforgiveable.\" But an unrepentant Mr Abbott said: \"It was a bit hair-raising. But I am thick-skinned.\" He said it was \"absolute rubbish\" to suggest that he had been irresponsible. Ray Carson, deputy district controller at Holyhead Coastguard, expressed relief that he had taken up the offer of the Royal Yachting Association's basic navigation course. \"We are delighted that the Royal Yachting Association has made such a generous offer,\" he said. \"We have every sympathy for Mr Abbott's predicament and we wish to help him in any way practicable.\" Mr Abbott denied that he had been a menace to the coastguard service. \"My boat is seaworthy but if you come to a point in the dark and it isn't easy to see your way, then you need help. That's the job of the RNLI,\" he said. Penny Haire, the RYA's chief cruising instructor, said the course, which normally costs \u00a3500, would teach Mr Abbott to be aware of his limitations and have a healthy respect for the sea. It would also give him an understanding of navigation and improve his boat handling ability. The course will include five days of theory where he will learn charting skills and a further five days of intensive practical training. No doubt the coastguard and lifeboat crews will breathe a collective sigh of relief when he finishes it.",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence faces the prospect of unprecedented legal action to force it to remove a damaged nuclear-powered submarine from Gibraltar. Its decision to try to repair HMS Tireless, which has been tied up since May 19 in full view of populated areas, has provoked protest in the British overseas territory. Though the ministry yesterday dismissed the submarine's problem as a \"minor defect\", sources with direct knowledge of the leak from the nuclear reactor describe it as serious. They say the fault is located above valves controlling pressure to the submarine's steam generators and is close to the reactor itself. \"The problem cannot be isolated,\" said one source, who declined to be identified. HMS Tireless limped into Gibraltar after radioactive coolant started leaking from the reactor when on patrol in the Mediterranean. In an indication of the gravity of the problem, the MoD has decided not to try to tow the submarine back to Britain. The defect is said to be the first of its kind in Britain's fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The ministry said yesterday that it was examining results of an inspection by the defence nuclear safety committee. The ministry said it hoped that the repairs could be accomplished by the autumn. A coalition of six groups representing a broad cross-section of Gibraltar's population of 28,000 yesterday sought legal advice from Hassans, a leading Gibraltar law firm. They include the campaigning Voice of Gibraltar Group, the Self Determination for Gibraltar Group, teachers' unions, the local United Nations Association, and the Gibraltar Federation of Small Businesses. They are planning a demonstration next Tuesday against the MoD's plans to repair the submarine on the Rock. A recent telephone poll which was carried out by Gibraltar television showed 79% of people against repairs taking place locally. \"There is a constitutional question whether a faulty nuclear submarine is a domestic or foreign issue,\" said Levi Attias of the Voice of Gibraltar Group yesterday. \"My argument is that it is domestic, and thus it is a matter of prime importance.\" The Gibraltar Labour-Liberal opposition blamed the Rock's government for failing to take a stand on the principle of \"whether the repairs to the nuclear submarine should be carried out in Gibraltar or not\". It also accused the MoD of giving evasive answers to the House of Commons. A leading Gibraltarian unaligned to any party described it as an \"issue of Gibraltarians' confidence in the Ministry of Defence\". He said that the submarine was lit up all night, 400 metres from the shore. \"People are very worried,\" he said. The ministry initially said HMS Tireless would be berthed at Gibraltar for no more than a few days, suggesting that it would then be towed back to Britain. John Spellar, the armed forces minister, described the protests as a \"local campaign\" which did not reflect the \"considerable number of Gibraltarians who actually work in the dockyard and depend on it for their living\". The submarine was becoming caught up in the wider question of the future of Gibraltar, he said, \"It is about 1,000 miles, by sea, to tow it back, so that would not necessarily be the most sensible option.\" He added that the reactor had been shut down and the problem had been like \"a dripping tap\".

The chain of events that led to the passing of \"three strikes and you're out\" legislation in California tells its own story. In 1993, Polly Klaas, 12, was raped and murdered by a man on parole. Huge media coverage influenced citizens and victims' groups to lobby for the legislation, which was signed into law by the governor in record time. California continues to be unimpressed by arguments that mandatory sentencing is both costly and ineffective. People who commit violent crime should be punished severely. But the evidence is clear: unharnessed raw emotion leads to thoughtless crime policies. Nick Flynn Prison Reform Trust",

      "body": "<p>When you live in the same house as Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, said recently, be prepared for surprises. Needless to say, Milosevic's surprises are always unpleasant, as Djukanovic found when the Serbian leader earlier this summer rigged the constitution to allow himself two more potential terms as president of rump Yugoslavia and to demote Montenegro in the changed federal institutions.</p> <p>Among others also recently surprised by Milosevic are the unfortunate Britons and Canadians picked up this month on the border between Kosovo and Montenegro and now before a military court in Belgrade. The two surprises are connected. The four foreigners have been assigned bit parts in a drama of encirclement staged by Milosevic, a drama in which Djukanovic has one of the larger roles. The ruthless survivor in Belgrade has created in Serbia an atmosphere of paranoia that is even more irrational than that which prevailed 10 years ago as Yugoslavia's wars were germinating.

      "bodyText": "When you live in the same house as Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, said recently, be prepared for surprises. Needless to say, Milosevic's surprises are always unpleasant, as Djukanovic found when the Serbian leader earlier this summer rigged the constitution to allow himself two more potential terms as president of rump Yugoslavia and to demote Montenegro in the changed federal institutions. Among others also recently surprised by Milosevic are the unfortunate Britons and Canadians picked up this month on the border between Kosovo and Montenegro and now before a military court in Belgrade. The two surprises are connected. The four foreigners have been assigned bit parts in a drama of encirclement staged by Milosevic, a drama in which Djukanovic has one of the larger roles. The ruthless survivor in Belgrade has created in Serbia an atmosphere of paranoia that is even more irrational than that which prevailed 10 years ago as Yugoslavia's wars were germinating. Serbia is under constant attack, he gives his nation to understand, just as he himself, as their leader, is physically threatened. In Milosevic's world, teams of assassins are paid by the French to kill him and his associates, Serbian journalists operate as covert agents for the west, and the neighbouring republic of Montenegro is swarming with traitors, foreign spies, mercenaries, and British SAS men. Serbs may not altogether believe in this picture of the unrelenting hostility of most of the outside world, but it nevertheless plays to their vulnerabilities. \"Their fears,\" a recent report by a Bulgarian institute concluded, \"are... for their biological survival because of the collapse of the health system, of environmental pollution and radiation after the air raids, of civil war, of political repression, of isolation.\" Again and again the investigators were told that the nation is \"sinking to the bottom\".

As president of its ruling council, he became the navigator for the party leader, David Trimble, providing advice - and sometimes steel - through the lengthy negotiation and subsequent implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which redefined the British-Irish relationship and the position of Northern Ireland more fundamentally than at any time since partition in 1922.</p> <p>Three times, Cunningham chaired crucial meetings of the 900-member council to determine party policy and tactics. His private staff work beforehand, reasoning and arm-twisting when necessary, was vital to holding the party together, so closely was it divided into factions for and against the peace deal.

At the time of his death, Cunningham was set to be heavily involved in repelling the gathering anti-agreement forces within the Ulster Unionist party at the forthcoming byelection in his own South Antrim heartland. He was also preoccupied with work to modernise the party organisation and structures, and curb the unwieldy influence of bodies like the Orange Order. That task requires courage and vision, and the unionists will find it hard to produce a replacement father-figure with Cunningham's qualities.</p> <p>But if the peace process does endure, much of the credit will belong to him.

After graduating from Cambridge with an MA in biological sciences, he joined the family stockbroking firm in Belfast, and continued to farm at Templepatrick, earning acclaim as a prizewinning cattle breeder, while his wife, Anne, matched his achievements, with horses. His wealthy family also controlled the Northern Whig newspaper until it was closed in the 1960s. With one uncle, Sir Knox Cunningham, a long-serving unionist MP at Westminster, and another, Lt Col James Glencairn Cunningham, president and patron of the Ulster Unionist party, it was inevitable that Josias would become involved in politics. Emerging from his local South Antrim Unionist Association, he became a party officer in 1974 and was elected president of the Ulster Unionist Council in 1990. Known as \"the money man\", he used his extensive business contacts and acumen to help keep his party financially, as well as politically, viable.</p> <p>Cunningham first made his mark as confidante and adviser to James (now Lord) Molyneaux, who led the Ulster Unionist party from 1979 to 1995. Working stealthily behind the scenes, he played a key role in keeping the once all-powerful party together as it threatened to fragment. In the 1980s, the Ulster Unionist party almost tore itself apart trying to decide whether the union with Britain was best protected by pushing for parity with Scotland and Wales, or going along with the Westminster government's attempts to forge a peace agreement based on nationalists sharing power with unionists in Belfast, and what was designated as \"an Irish dimension\" - something that was anathema to unionists.</p> <p>Cunningham's influence was the telling factor in inspiring his party members to stand their ground, despite being pressured, on the one hand, by the British government and, on the other, by the diehard Rev Ian Paisley, who persistently taunted them for being soft on the union, and whose great political ambition was to seduce the party and use it as a vehicle to propel himself to the fore as the unrivalled and almighty defender of uncompromising unionism. Under Cunningham's guidance, and with his consent, Molyneaux opted to play a long game, slowing down and frustrating the British government's game plan by protracting or boycotting negotiations.</p> <p>The skill with which he also resisted Paisley's alternating bluster and blandishments was heavily choreographed by Cunningham. As the negotiating ground around the unionists narrowed in the run-up to the Belfast agreement in April 1998, Cunningham was again at the heart of the process, this time recognising, albeit grudgingly, that realpolitik and the forces of history now compelled unionists to make a historic compromise with the rest of Ireland.

      "body": "<p>The last time Clint Eastwood was in a science fiction movie Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House, the studio system was still largely intact and three out of four Warner brothers were still breathing. </p> <p>Not that you would have noticed him in either Revenge of the Creature (his debut) or Tarantula. In one he played 19th labcoat from the right, row six; and in the other a bomber pilot who puts paid to the world-dominating ambitions of the eponymous arachnid. </p> <p>Today the tall, skinny erstwhile nobody is more famous than any American president (a job some people would be happy to see him doing), more famous than the Warner brothers at whose studio he's been securely perched for over 30 years, and now, at a ripe, lean 70 years old, he's finally ready to don his goldfish-bowl helmet and his asbestos space-undies. So do we have lift-off? </p> <p>Yes we do, but we also have gravity working against us. The central image of Space Cowboys is a shot of four old men's saggy backsides. They belong to Clint, James Garner (72), Donald Sutherland (66) and Tommy Lee Jones (53). Or if you prefer to linger in the past, they belong to Rowdy Yates, Bret Maverick, Hawkeye Pierce and Gary Gilmore (or the comparably psychotic Howard Hughes - take your pick). Time and gravity have not been kind to their saddle- sore posteriors: They droop and bulge, they hang asymmetrically, pitted with alarming dimples, divots and craters. Collectively, they look like a rear view of Mount Rushmore - or four pictures of Dorian Gray's arse by Francis Bacon. </p> <p> Space Cowboys is a fantasy about overcoming obsolescence and proving that age need not diminish us, but it's typical of Eastwood's terse directorial style and his taste for sardonic self-deprecation that he undercuts any illusions about his heroes' potency by parading their ill-upholstered buttocks so unflatteringly. \"Boys will be boys,\" goes the movie's tagline, but these tragic arses remind us that boys will one day also be grouchy, shagged-out old geezers reaching for their Geritol. </p> <p> Eastwood is doing a good job of growing old. Not for him the surgeon's slab, the vaseline on the lens, the truss, or the digitally adjusted hairline. He has made a canny virtue of his age - and had fun doing it - ever since he gained full control of his career in the early 70s. The Man with No Name is now equally well known as the man who couldn't shoot straight or mount a horse in Unforgiven. The man who played emotionally dead Harry Callahan finally managed to shed a tear (... or did he? - the debate rages still) in Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire, and the sexually inscrutable superhero of yesteryear even submitted to heavy bondage in the modestly pervy Tightrope. Old age is just another means of enriching his characters, because the stakes are always higher as the shadows lengthen and evening approaches. </p> <p> Space Cowboys opens at high noon in the four men's lives. It's 1958, and they're Team Daedalus, a testosterone-fuelled quartet training to be the first men into space. These boys are very much fathers to the old men they'll become. Frank (who grows up to be Eastwood) is a great flier but not a team player. Hawk (Jones) is an irresponsible thrill-junkie. Jerry and Tank (Sutherland and Garner) are a womanising engineer and a wiseass co-pilot who take a backseat to the two-fisted rivalry between Frank and Hawk. (Disconcertingly, the scenes use young actors dubbed by the four ageing stars.) But Team Daedalus never leaves terra firma. At the last moment, their boss and nemesis Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) sends a chimpanzee up in their place. They look as if their whole lives are ruined. </p> <p> Cut to the present, where Clint, now a retired Nasa engineer, is making a balls-up of installing a new garage-door opener when he's visited by Nasa techies Marcia Gay Harden and Loren Dean. A Russian satellite with a design based on Frank's own blueprints for Skylab needs the attention of an engineer with suitably vintage technical skills. On meeting Cromwell again (their mutual contempt has not subsided), Frank suggests that the only way to fix the bird is to send the original Team Daedalus into space to repair it. Forty years on, it looks as if the dreams of their 20s may come true in their late 60s. </p> <p> This entirely ridiculous, utterly loveable premise - The Right Stuff meets Grumpy Old Men - unleashes oodles of geezer jokes, as the younger trainees send cans of the pensioner's dietary supplement Increase to the old boys' canteen table, and they reply with baby food. The mid-section of the movie is a symphony of creaking joints, hacking coughs and crotchety groans (\"I haven't jogged since the goddamn Nixon administration!\" huffs Sutherland). In the intervening years, Tank has become a preacher, Hawk a crop-duster and Jerry a designer of rollercoasters, none of which has been a substitute for the status of first man in space, and all of which suggests that none of them has ever grown up. </p> <p> The story thus primed, Eastwood and scriptwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner lazily subject their four old farts to the predictable, plot-pointed rigours of mainstream story architecture. Now's their chance to learn to be team players, bury old rivalries, grow up, slow down. </p> <p> Space Cowboys' best moments depend on its likeable quartet of stars. Elsewhere, as is often the case when Eastwood is his own helmsman, the pacing is a little too slack for the movie's own good. Clint's recent directorial outings have been frankly unmemorable. The Bridges of Madison County was vain and empty. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was horribly uneven, and True Crime was implausible, slipshod and clumsy. Space Cowboys is an improvement on all of them, but it lacks the tautness and sinew we associate with sub-Don Siegel exercises like The Outlaw Josey Wales (which Eastwood helmed after firing future Right Stuff director Phil Kaufman) or Unforgiven. </p> <p> Still, though the female roles are as ill-conceived and underwritten as they always are in Clint's movies, the famously easygoing Garner is criminally underused, and though the whole movie loses steam once the Space Shuttle is launched and the effects kick in, it's still a rare pleasure to see these senior citizens given so much screen time, droopy bums and all.</p>",

They belong to Clint, James Garner (72), Donald Sutherland (66) and Tommy Lee Jones (53). Or if you prefer to linger in the past, they belong to Rowdy Yates, Bret Maverick, Hawkeye Pierce and Gary Gilmore (or the comparably psychotic Howard Hughes - take your pick). Time and gravity have not been kind to their saddle- sore posteriors: They droop and bulge, they hang asymmetrically, pitted with alarming dimples, divots and craters. Collectively, they look like a rear view of Mount Rushmore - or four pictures of Dorian Gray's arse by Francis Bacon. Space Cowboys is a fantasy about overcoming obsolescence and proving that age need not diminish us, but it's typical of Eastwood's terse directorial style and his taste for sardonic self-deprecation that he undercuts any illusions about his heroes' potency by parading their ill-upholstered buttocks so unflatteringly. \"Boys will be boys,\" goes the movie's tagline, but these tragic arses remind us that boys will one day also be grouchy, shagged-out old geezers reaching for their Geritol. Eastwood is doing a good job of growing old. Not for him the surgeon's slab, the vaseline on the lens, the truss, or the digitally adjusted hairline. He has made a canny virtue of his age - and had fun doing it - ever since he gained full control of his career in the early 70s. The Man with No Name is now equally well known as the man who couldn't shoot straight or mount a horse in Unforgiven. The man who played emotionally dead Harry Callahan finally managed to shed a tear (... or did he? - the debate rages still) in Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire, and the sexually inscrutable superhero of yesteryear even submitted to heavy bondage in the modestly pervy Tightrope. Old age is just another means of enriching his characters, because the stakes are always higher as the shadows lengthen and evening approaches. Space Cowboys opens at high noon in the four men's lives. It's 1958, and they're Team Daedalus, a testosterone-fuelled quartet training to be the first men into space. These boys are very much fathers to the old men they'll become. Frank (who grows up to be Eastwood) is a great flier but not a team player. Hawk (Jones) is an irresponsible thrill-junkie. Jerry and Tank (Sutherland and Garner) are a womanising engineer and a wiseass co-pilot who take a backseat to the two-fisted rivalry between Frank and Hawk. (Disconcertingly, the scenes use young actors dubbed by the four ageing stars.) But Team Daedalus never leaves terra firma. At the last moment, their boss and nemesis Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) sends a chimpanzee up in their place. They look as if their whole lives are ruined. Cut to the present, where Clint, now a retired Nasa engineer, is making a balls-up of installing a new garage-door opener when he's visited by Nasa techies Marcia Gay Harden and Loren Dean. A Russian satellite with a design based on Frank's own blueprints for Skylab needs the attention of an engineer with suitably vintage technical skills. On meeting Cromwell again (their mutual contempt has not subsided), Frank suggests that the only way to fix the bird is to send the original Team Daedalus into space to repair it. Forty years on, it looks as if the dreams of their 20s may come true in their late 60s. This entirely ridiculous, utterly loveable premise - The Right Stuff meets Grumpy Old Men - unleashes oodles of geezer jokes, as the younger trainees send cans of the pensioner's dietary supplement Increase to the old boys' canteen table, and they reply with baby food. The mid-section of the movie is a symphony of creaking joints, hacking coughs and crotchety groans (\"I haven't jogged since the goddamn Nixon administration!\" huffs Sutherland). In the intervening years, Tank has become a preacher, Hawk a crop-duster and Jerry a designer of rollercoasters, none of which has been a substitute for the status of first man in space, and all of which suggests that none of them has ever grown up. The story thus primed, Eastwood and scriptwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner lazily subject their four old farts to the predictable, plot-pointed rigours of mainstream story architecture. Now's their chance to learn to be team players, bury old rivalries, grow up, slow down. Space Cowboys' best moments depend on its likeable quartet of stars. Elsewhere, as is often the case when Eastwood is his own helmsman, the pacing is a little too slack for the movie's own good. Clint's recent directorial outings have been frankly unmemorable. The Bridges of Madison County was vain and empty. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was horribly uneven, and True Crime was implausible, slipshod and clumsy. Space Cowboys is an improvement on all of them, but it lacks the tautness and sinew we associate with sub-Don Siegel exercises like The Outlaw Josey Wales (which Eastwood helmed after firing future Right Stuff director Phil Kaufman) or Unforgiven. Still, though the female roles are as ill-conceived and underwritten as they always are in Clint's movies, the famously easygoing Garner is criminally underused, and though the whole movie loses steam once the Space Shuttle is launched and the effects kick in, it's still a rare pleasure to see these senior citizens given so much screen time, droopy bums and all.",

It never feels overstretched and there's a lot of twisty plot - and plotting - to fit in. Director Anthony Minghella relishes recreating the beaches and nightlife of 50s Italy and his film has the pleasant after-effect of a short holiday. Highsmith's anti-hero is an audacious, amoral anti-hero, social climber and - occasionally, just when circumstances force him into it - murderer. The smoothly seductive Alain Delon, in Ren\u00e9 Clement's sharp 1960 version, Plein Soleil, is much more how I envisioned Ripley but Matt Damon, gawky in big glasses, provides a very different interpretation - not a chameleon smoothly integrating into the jet set but a determined chancer. We see Damon working hard on his schemes and imitations and laboriously teaching himself jazz - the quickest way to gain the favour of playboy Dickie Greenleaf (an Oscar-nominated turn by Jude Law) whose millionaire father has already been duped into believing Ripley to be an old college friend of his son. And, as in the books, you find yourself rooting for this shameless villain who appreciates all the things the playboy Law takes for granted. The gay subtext that was just an undertone in Highsmith's book - perhaps because it was published in 1955 - becomes a vital part of Minghella's screenplay and provides a good part for a second Brit, Jack Davenport, though Philip Seymour Hoffman, creating an entirely different character from Boogie Nights and Happiness, steals all his scenes as usual. Endlessly reinventing himself, he would have made a very interesting Ripley. Highsmith's male characters were always more convincing than her women, so it's unsurprising that Gwyneth Paltrow gets an uninteresting role and Cate Blanchett is wasted. For almost 50 years since Strangers on a Train, only Europeans made good use of Highsmith's uniquely devious qualities.

It starts as a light comedy but moves into a desperate twilight world as its protagonists become increasingly drug-reliant. The amount of wired bad behaviour on offer here makes Scorsese's Nic Cage look well-adjusted by comparison. Director Scott Ziehl (also co-writer and co-producer) keeps things raw to match this high-pressure line of work, but allows some offbeat subplots - like Field's charming relationship with his grandad.</p> <p><strong> Two Hands </strong><br> Rental<br> High Fliers<br> Cert 15 <br> ** </p> <p>Quite likeable gangster thriller which stands out from the recent bunch by being set in Sydney, with King's Cross and Bondi locations making a pleasant change.

Rachel Griffiths, the Australian actress best known for Hilary and Jackie, Muriel's Wedding, and My Son the Fanatic is filming the pilot of Six Feet Under, a TV series written and directed by Alan Ball, the Oscar-winning writer of American Beauty. She will be back on British screens next week in Me Myself I, which has won further recognition for her presence, wit and versatility.</p> <p> In this Australian-French production directed by Pip Karmel, Griffiths plays a high-powered and stressed-out journalist who, through a freak event, gets the opportunity to rewind her life - as it were - and live it differently. Since she first came to international attention in Muriel's Wedding in 1994, Griffiths has had ample opportunity to study journalists at close quarters, but playing one remained a challenge.</p> <p> \"I was on a junket [a press publicity event beloved of LA film publicists] for something just before I started filming so I used it as a research tool and ended up interviewing the journalists,\" says Griffiths, sitting on the cemetery grass in the afternoon sun. \"I would say things like: 'Are you happy in your job?' which would freak them out because most are not. The other thing that really struck me was what an intensely competitive and ungenerous field it is. I think journalists think that the movie business is like that, but on a film it's usually profoundly the opposite of competitive. It's very collaborative and very emotionally supportive. I had not considered how journalism is really the opposite, how few journalists had really great friends in the same field and how the new young guy in the corner desk is eyeing your job. I think that creates a necessity of hardness and I explored some of those themes in Me Myself I; what it means when you can't bring your emotional life or your vulnerability to work at all.</p> <p> \"I think politics and journalism are two areas which are totally unforgiving and I thought what effect it must have on a human being,\" she continues. \"I found that much more interesting than the more obvious stuff about manipulating the stories. I came to understand what a brutalising profession it is.\" </p> <p>So far, she says, she had had few bad personal experiences with the press. \"I never became an actor to become famous and it's not something I really engaged in. I was very naive. I think celebrity has been building as a substitute for meaning - but then you read books about Byron who was totally a celebrity and everyone wanted to know who he had sex with last night and what country he was in and who he owed money to and was he sleeping with his sister - and that was hundreds of years ago.</p> <p>\"Me Myself I, she says, \"seemed to plug into a lot of things women in their 30s are feeling at the moment. It's that feeling of: 'If I have everything that my grandmother could only have dreamed of achieving, why aren't I happy?' I think men have that as well. So many people are overworked with no sense of security. I think the film in the end is about how work can only be so meaningful no matter how successful you are.</p> <p>\"I found it charming that my character got a chance to live another life, but it was more the idea that she realises the way she had been dealing with herself. Sometimes it's not till you get what you want that you realise it's not going to fulfil what you imagined it might. I can kind of relate to that and see many of my friends in that - the whole Bridget Jones and Sex and the City thing. There is a real nerve that these things are touching.\"</p> <p>Another attraction of the film was the chance to do something with a lighter touch. \"I had been doing this really intense stuff like Hilary and Jackie and My Son and Among Giants, and then I went home and did The Doll's House - as if I hadn't suffered enough!

Then this film came along and I wanted to work back home as well.\"</p> <p>Since Russell Crowe's latest critical thumbs-up in Gladiator and the arrival of Heath Ledger in The Patriot there has been much breathless copy about the new wave of Australian actors. The Queensland-born Griffiths points out that it's nothing new. \"Mel (Gibson) and Judy (Davis) were there such a long time ago and you can go back to Errol Flynn and Peter Finch. I think that Australian men are really powerful energies on screen. And the actresses in the last 10 years have been making a lot of international noise - Toni Collette and Cate Blanchett - but it's also a credit to our very fine drama schools. I think we produce very unmannered actors and the world responds to that. The women are not coy; we have to kind of match the men we produce! Russell has been successful in our eyes for a very long time - he had been doing very fine work well before LA Confidential - and I grew up watching Geoffrey (Rush) in the theatre and just blowing my mind and inspiring me to be that kind of actor - and he made his first film at 38.\"</p> <p> Griffiths grew up with an artistic mother who took her to everything from Japanese Kabuki and Noh theatre to Indian dance and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She is happy to be working in the US now, she says, as she admires Alan Ball's work a lot - she has seen American Beauty seven times - and mentions Rushmore and Election as films that had stood out for her in the past year. \"I think American film at the moment is original, daring, unpredictable and I can't imagine saying that five years ago.\" </p> <p>The making of Six Feet Under - she plays the girlfriend of a young man who inherits a funeral business in this series made for American cable channel HBO, which is being tipped as their next hit to follow The Sopranos - means that California will be her home for five months; but she does not envisage the final leap to live there, keeping one base in London and another in Sydney. \"There are so many things about the Californian lifestyle that I have in Sydney, but it's much cleaner.

But the Germans' \"panty police\" who patrol the beaches failed to appreciate the distinction. Alerted by a fisherman, they arrested Chytilova, a cameraman and a technician. \"Paedophilia was suspected because German laws forbid filming of children on the beach,\" a police spokesman explained. \"They spoilt our opportunity to make use of the last rays of sun,\" Chytilova ranted on her release, before retreating to a secret location in south Bohemia to finish the film. </p> <p>She is the first to admit to being a control freak who recently attempted to direct her own death scene. At home and feeling under the weather, she became convinced her hours were numbered. \"I found the idea rather disagreeable that the moment after my death, I would lose total control of what happened, and someone would have to find my remains.\" As it turned out, she was just suffering from wind, but the experience was humbling. </p> <p>The scene could have come straight from one of the 71-year-old Chytilova's films: choppily and hastily edited, with lashings of grotesque humour, and imbued with the nervous vigour of their director. </p> <p>The red-haired grand dame, who made a name for herself as a leading representative of the 60s new wave, has just received an award for her outstanding contribution to world cinematography at the 35th Karlovy Vary film festival. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I'd rather have cash than laurels,\" she sniffs, before adding hastily, \"but it's certainly one in the eye for all the negative critics out there.\" </p> <p>Which calls to mind her 1966 film, Daisies. Decried by some as gibberish, hailed by others as refreshingly uncompromising and radical, it highlighted surreal aspects of the Czech new wave and cemented her reputation alongside Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel as a pioneer and as one of a generation who made a huge impact on world cinema. </p> <p>But while Forman made it to the west after the positive reception of A Blonde in Love and The Firemen's Ball (and would go on to win Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus), and Menzel's 1967 Oscar for Closely Observed Trains earned him a name that stretched far beyond the borders of communist Czechoslovakia, what happened to Vera Chytilova's career? </p> <p>Choleric, diabolically crazy, aggressive, ironic, sarcastic, inflexible and arrogant - just a few of the phrases used by the Czech media to describe her after she collected her prize. Some who know her say these characteristics stem from a bitterness she shares with others of her generation, who spent the best years of their lives working under a totalitarian regime. </p> <p>She describes herself as an \"overheated kettle that you can't turn down\", but puts it down to impatience. \"You always have to work as if what you're working on could be your last,\" she says. \"I want to move on, even if I have to crawl.\" Chytilova cultivates the art of being deliberately ruthless. \"I have no desire to cuddle my audience,\" she emphatically states. </p> <p>Tainted Horseplay, from 1988, was one of the first films about Aids.

I cannot watch them. There's not a shred of consolation,\" says a feminist sociologist from Prague's Charles University, who preferred not to be named. </p> <p>So does Chytilova consider herself a feminist, and if so, how does this affect her film-making? \"Is your newspaper a serious one?\" She peers over her large sunglasses. \"You ask pointless and primitive questions.\" </p> <p>Her steam rising, she explains that she does not believe in feminism per se, but in individualism. \"If there's something you don't like, don't keep to the rules - break them. I'm an enemy of stupidity and simple-mindedness in both men and women and I have rid my living space of these traits.\" </p> <p>Her abrasive manner has earned her the moniker the Margaret Thatcher of Czech film, and she appears quite flattered by the comparison - though she swiftly adds that they have nothing in common politically. \"People are generally weak, cautious and frightened of being embarrassed, whereas I'm merciless and impertinent.\" </p> <p>Film-making with Chytilova is by all accounts a harrowing experience. She shouts and screams, and gleefully admits to beating up her cameramen when they prove unwilling to try out new ideas. </p> <p>She is currently trying to raise funding for Chased from Paradise, but after the nudist beach location problem, she is having trouble drumming up sponsorship, even among the sexually liberated Czechs. </p> <p>\"Hollywood demands that its viewers have a clear idea of time and environment, and Chytilova makes films with unpeeled layers - which meant she couldn't be attacked by the communists. But she still uses that protection now,\" says fellow Czech Sasa Gedeon, a 29-year-old director acclaimed for his 1999 film, Return of the Idiot. But Alice Nellis, who this year won international awards for her humanist film Eenie Meeny, adds: \"She's bonkers, that's clear, but I really appreciate her ability to grasp what's around and to find great metaphors for social issues.\" </p> <p>Chytilova has no regrets that she declined invitations in the 60s, shortly before the Prague Spring, to move westwards. She chuckles, though, at a recent request from a French film-maker who wished to remake one of her communist-era films. \"So the Americans are remaking French films, and the French are remaking Czech films.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When people try to tell Mike Figgis that his new film is based on a gimmick, he thinks to himself that they couldn't be more wrong. It's true that Time Code was shot with four lightweight digital cameras, running simultaneously, and in a single take, which is to say in just over 90 minutes of real time, and that the result is projected in cinemas on to a screen divided into four frames, so that everything that was filmed can be seen (and heard), all at the same time. But how on earth can that be a gimmick? </p> <p>The real gimmick, he says, is conventional film editing - the process, almost as old as cinema itself, of chopping up bits of film and arranging them into a structure that is calculated to concentrate the narrative and probably has nothing to do with the order in which the sequences were shot. Simply by virtue of the technique with which it was produced, Time Code could be said to be more faithful to its story and its characters than any ensemble film ever made. </p> <p>\"Editing is a huge series of gimmicks with which we've all become overfamiliar,\" the 52-year-old director of Internal Affairs and Leaving Las Vegas said. As he speaks, he is surrounded by guitars, keyboards and editing equipment in the office of his production company, Red Mullet, just off London's Charlotte Street. \"The marriage between editing and plot has got to such an extent now that the audience is hooked on this constant adrenalin delivery.\" </p> <p>As a result, he continued, viewers are reduced to a state of passivity. \"I find that really distressing. In America they eat and go for a piss and talk the whole time, and it's got something to do with the fact that there's no interaction between them and the screen any more. I've been struggling the last couple of years to find different narrative forms. This film is delivering constantly the idea that you might be missing something, so you can't afford to go and take a piss or take your eyes off the screen. People who watch it seem far more alert, whether they like it or not, because of the degree of attention required to watch the film.\" </p> <p>Time Code is an extraordinary work, for at least three reasons. The first is the way it forces viewers to rearrange their habits of perception, following the action as it moves the focus of its several plot strands around the screen from one frame to another. They are led by Figgis's sound mix, which tends to put one frame into the aural foreground (although sometimes the sounds from frames are allowed to compete with each other, and occasionally he fades the whole lot down to silence), and by his characteristically adroit use of music. When you get used to it, the effect is so exhilarating that the next conventional single-frame movie you see may seem curiously undernourished. </p> <p>And that leads to the second reason, which is the film's dramatic richness. To get some idea of this, try imagining a normal movie, with its plots and sub-plots. Think of the action on the screen, and of its linearity. Now think of the hidden action - the other elements of the story that you can't see. Then imagine being able to see everything all at once. Both ends of a telephone call, for instance. Or not just someone waiting on a street corner, but also the person who is making them wait. Causes and effects, nar rative strands converging or diverging or just running in parallel in front of your eyes. Sometimes literally bumping into each other, as a character from one frame enters another. By his deployment of the latest technology, Figgis appears to have done nothing less than take cinema into a realm even further away from the condition of literature and theatre. </p> <p>A third reason to take notice of Time Code is that it cost less than $4m to make, thanks to the use of a tiny crew and very few of the usual Hollywood facilities. The cast, including several famous names, accepted a two-tier pay scale, wore their own clothes and did their own make-up. All of them, with the single exception of the visitor from Sweden, made their own way from their homes to the set every morning. On their breaks they ate together in nearby restaurants. No one could keep a limo waiting or sulk in a caravan, because no one had a limo or a caravan. </p> <p>The comparative lightness of the film's subject and tone - a satire on life among the ambitious actresses, cocaine-addled producers, megalomaniac directors and dippy new-age therapists who colonise the stretch of Sunset Boulevard that runs from the Chateau Marmont to the Viper Room - probably helps the audience navigate the unfamiliar terrain of Time Code. The multiple-narrative structure was inspired by Hitchcock's Rear Window and Altman's Nashville. But the four principal characters, played by Saffron Burrows, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Salma Hayek and the remarkable Stellan Skarsgard, and a dozen or so secondary players, including Holly Hunter, Julian Sands and Kyle MacLachlan, explore an emotional range veering from Sirkian melodrama to a comedy of modern manners. </p> <p> The unconventional method arrived as a development of Figgis's work on his two most recent feature films. The Loss of Sexual Innocence, a commercial flop released last year, was based on a series of linked short stories. His adaptation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, starring Burrows and Peter Mullan, shown in the US a year ago and scheduled for a British release in September, features the use of a split screen and simultaneous shooting with two hand-held cameras. </p> <p>Improvising from the director's instructions, the actors and the four camera operators - one of them Figgis himself - performed Time Code in its entirety 16 times, once a day to start with and twice a day towards the end of the schedule. Instead of a script, Figgis gave them music paper, its lines divided into the 93 minutes of the cameras' capacity, the actors filling in the details as they noted down the movements of the cameras and the other characters, allowing the story to develop in a manner recalling theatre workshops or the bands of Charles Mingus - both familiar to Figgis, who is a trumpet-player and spent the 1970s working with the People Show. </p> <p>\"It comes out of a music sensibility,\" he said, explaining the origins of the scheme. \"It's really a string quartet, if you think about it. The whole film was actually written on music paper, not only as a way of laying it all out but as an inspirational device. It took about 10 minutes to teach the system to all the actors, and to give them their own blank music paper already mapped out in the four-stave system with the bar lines marked in.\" </p> <p>They were given their cues and told: \"If you're interested in knowing what's going on in the other three stories, here's what's happening at the same time as you're doing that. And, by the way, everybody should write everything down because you need to know what the context is. Because although you think you're doing hot stuff to your camera, there are three other screens going on and actually screen four is where the narrative is at this moment. So you can just read the paper for a while. Do it interestingly, but there's no pressure on you to deliver the goods dramatically until bar 73, where you will become the focus. So at that point be sure that you're ready and in position.\" </p> <p>They filmed every morning, and in the afternoon they would watch the results replayed simultaneously on four TV monitors. Then they discussed the problems and planned adjustments for the next day's shoot. \"For the first couple of days,\" Figgis said, \"everyone was laughing their heads off and having a great time. That was lovely. It's nice when actors have a good time. But I knew that would turn into something which could go sour on itself. So once they'd stopped enjoying each other's dialogue, they started to pull it back a bit and pare it down and the improvisation became not so much about what kind of clever dialogue can we invent but how cleverly can you manipulate something, and where can you place it, and how long are the pauses.\" </p> <p>The use of hand-held digital cameras capable of a single take the length of a feature film, as opposed to the 10-minute maximum of conventional 35mm film cameras, presented the actors with a set of challenges which pushed them into a different and much freer approach. </p> <p>\"They didn't have to do technical acting to camera, worrying about marks and focus. Most importantly, as in music, five minutes into the performance you're warmed up and you're going somewhere with the character that you hadn't planned. Plus the digital cameras don't have the kind of iconic quality that you see on film sets. That's terrifying for actors, looking into the expressionless faces of these teams of big fat geezers, usually, who just look straight through you. Once you eradicate all that it goes back to theatre, but at the same time it's not theatre because it's not a question of projecting to an audience at the back.\" </p> <p>What all this does not do, of course, is ingratiate Mike Figgis, whose commitment to new technology is total, with the film technicians of traditional Hollywood. \"There's complete panic among the cinematography community,\" he said. \"I've had people spit at me at the Directors' Guild and the Academy. It's almost like this is the devil. Films are so full of pretension and of fake structure, so full of bullshit. Basically it's just that your livelihood is threatened.\" </p> <p>Figgis's cinema career, which began in 1988 with the Tyneside thriller Stormy Monday, first peaked two years later with Internal Affairs, in which he revived Richard Gere's career and created one for Andy Garcia, and reached its commercial zenith in 1995 with Leaving Las Vegas, for which he and his star, Nicolas Cage, won Oscars. His box-office failures have included Liebestraum, Mr Jones, The Browning Version and One Night Stand. In between the major projects, he has made striking television documentaries on a Spanish flamenco school and the American choreographer William Forsythe, and compiled a series of 20 filmed interviews with film people, published by Faber as a recent edition of Projections. Soon he and Laurie Anderson will edit his film of her recent performance at the Barbican. Now he sits in the Red Mullet office, surrounded by miniaturised pieces of digital kit that free him from the last vestiges of pressure to come up with formula hits. </p> <p>So has the ability to make films cheaply and quickly changed his own view of his standing in Hollywood? \"Completely.\" </p> <p>The new technology, he feels, has freed him of the obligation to come up with another Leaving Las Vegas. \"The thing now is that if you want to do one of those, you just do it. The bliss is in the removal of the reliance on patronage, which is a colossal waste of time, because those people are programmed to go so slowly, almost like it's a kind of deliberate plot to make sure that any interesting idea becomes stagnant and goes off by the time you get to make it. It's a little bit scary that now if you have a good idea you just get on with it.\" </p> <p>Time Code's four-frame format may not be the equivalent of the addition of sound or colour to the cinema's technical repertoire, in the sense that one day all films will be like this. But to watch it is to feel in the presence of something that will make a real contribution, direct or indirect, to the future language of film. And a new way of telling stories is no gimmick.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Figgis presents a live mix of Time Code at the Edinburgh Film Festival on Wednesday. The film goes on release on next Friday.</p>",

His adaptation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, starring Burrows and Peter Mullan, shown in the US a year ago and scheduled for a British release in September, features the use of a split screen and simultaneous shooting with two hand-held cameras. Improvising from the director's instructions, the actors and the four camera operators - one of them Figgis himself - performed Time Code in its entirety 16 times, once a day to start with and twice a day towards the end of the schedule. Instead of a script, Figgis gave them music paper, its lines divided into the 93 minutes of the cameras' capacity, the actors filling in the details as they noted down the movements of the cameras and the other characters, allowing the story to develop in a manner recalling theatre workshops or the bands of Charles Mingus - both familiar to Figgis, who is a trumpet-player and spent the 1970s working with the People Show. \"It comes out of a music sensibility,\" he said, explaining the origins of the scheme. \"It's really a string quartet, if you think about it. The whole film was actually written on music paper, not only as a way of laying it all out but as an inspirational device. It took about 10 minutes to teach the system to all the actors, and to give them their own blank music paper already mapped out in the four-stave system with the bar lines marked in.\" They were given their cues and told: \"If you're interested in knowing what's going on in the other three stories, here's what's happening at the same time as you're doing that. And, by the way, everybody should write everything down because you need to know what the context is. Because although you think you're doing hot stuff to your camera, there are three other screens going on and actually screen four is where the narrative is at this moment. So you can just read the paper for a while. Do it interestingly, but there's no pressure on you to deliver the goods dramatically until bar 73, where you will become the focus. So at that point be sure that you're ready and in position.\" They filmed every morning, and in the afternoon they would watch the results replayed simultaneously on four TV monitors. Then they discussed the problems and planned adjustments for the next day's shoot. \"For the first couple of days,\" Figgis said, \"everyone was laughing their heads off and having a great time. That was lovely. It's nice when actors have a good time. But I knew that would turn into something which could go sour on itself. So once they'd stopped enjoying each other's dialogue, they started to pull it back a bit and pare it down and the improvisation became not so much about what kind of clever dialogue can we invent but how cleverly can you manipulate something, and where can you place it, and how long are the pauses.\" The use of hand-held digital cameras capable of a single take the length of a feature film, as opposed to the 10-minute maximum of conventional 35mm film cameras, presented the actors with a set of challenges which pushed them into a different and much freer approach. \"They didn't have to do technical acting to camera, worrying about marks and focus. Most importantly, as in music, five minutes into the performance you're warmed up and you're going somewhere with the character that you hadn't planned. Plus the digital cameras don't have the kind of iconic quality that you see on film sets. That's terrifying for actors, looking into the expressionless faces of these teams of big fat geezers, usually, who just look straight through you. Once you eradicate all that it goes back to theatre, but at the same time it's not theatre because it's not a question of projecting to an audience at the back.\" What all this does not do, of course, is ingratiate Mike Figgis, whose commitment to new technology is total, with the film technicians of traditional Hollywood. \"There's complete panic among the cinematography community,\" he said. \"I've had people spit at me at the Directors' Guild and the Academy. It's almost like this is the devil. Films are so full of pretension and of fake structure, so full of bullshit. Basically it's just that your livelihood is threatened.\" Figgis's cinema career, which began in 1988 with the Tyneside thriller Stormy Monday, first peaked two years later with Internal Affairs, in which he revived Richard Gere's career and created one for Andy Garcia, and reached its commercial zenith in 1995 with Leaving Las Vegas, for which he and his star, Nicolas Cage, won Oscars. His box-office failures have included Liebestraum, Mr Jones, The Browning Version and One Night Stand. In between the major projects, he has made striking television documentaries on a Spanish flamenco school and the American choreographer William Forsythe, and compiled a series of 20 filmed interviews with film people, published by Faber as a recent edition of Projections. Soon he and Laurie Anderson will edit his film of her recent performance at the Barbican. Now he sits in the Red Mullet office, surrounded by miniaturised pieces of digital kit that free him from the last vestiges of pressure to come up with formula hits. So has the ability to make films cheaply and quickly changed his own view of his standing in Hollywood? \"Completely.\" The new technology, he feels, has freed him of the obligation to come up with another Leaving Las Vegas. \"The thing now is that if you want to do one of those, you just do it. The bliss is in the removal of the reliance on patronage, which is a colossal waste of time, because those people are programmed to go so slowly, almost like it's a kind of deliberate plot to make sure that any interesting idea becomes stagnant and goes off by the time you get to make it. It's a little bit scary that now if you have a good idea you just get on with it.\" Time Code's four-frame format may not be the equivalent of the addition of sound or colour to the cinema's technical repertoire, in the sense that one day all films will be like this. But to watch it is to feel in the presence of something that will make a real contribution, direct or indirect, to the future language of film. And a new way of telling stories is no gimmick. \u0095 Mike Figgis presents a live mix of Time Code at the Edinburgh Film Festival on Wednesday. The film goes on release on next Friday.",

These are: the conservation of resources; the CFP's economic and social dimension; external fisheries relations; the Mediterranean; and good governance in fisheries policy through the involvement of those concerned. \u0095 For further information on EU policy, go to the Directorate General for Fisheries website.",

      "body": "<b>What is the problem?</b> <br> The problem is that, based on figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 70% of the world's fish stocks are now either fully exploited, overfished, depleted, or rebuilding from previous over-fishing. Marine pollution has also adversely affected fish populations. As a result world catches have plateaued since their peak in 1989, when 85 to 95m tonnes of fish were harvested. It seems unlikely they will start rising again until concerted efforts have been made at national and international levels to allow stocks to recover and then to fish them in a sustainable way. <p><b>Is this afflicting all countries equally?</b><br> Of the world's 15 major marine fishing regions, the productivity in all but two has fallen. With a history of intensive fishing, the Atlantic fisheries have experienced the biggest declines: fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic, the Southeast Atlantic and the Eastern Central Atlantic reached their maximum production levels 10 or 20 years ago, and catches have been declining since. In other Atlantic areas, the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific, annual catches are in more gradual decline, having reached maximum levels a few years ago. The only areas in which the FAO is projecting possible increases are in the Eastern and Western Indian Ocean and areas of the Pacific. These areas have not been as severely overfished as elsewhere on the globe. However, these are also the oceans for which estimates and stock assessments are least reliable, so any optimistic projections may be based on uncertain information. </p> <p><b>What can be done?</b><br> The FAO estimates that if stocks were allowed to recover and were then managed responsibly, about 100m tonnes (an increase of roughly 15m tonnes on current figures) could be caught globally. More careful managing of bycatch (fish which no one meant to catch being dragged along into the net) and discards (fish no one wants being thrown back into the sea, usually dead) would reduce the number of fish mortalities which never even get packed into a supermarket freezer. Some scientists also argue the solution could be aquaculture, though there are also fears that aquaculture will create more problems than it will solve. </p> <p><b>What exactly is aquaculture?</b><br> Aquaculture is the pseudo-scientific term for fish farming, ie cultivating fish in controlled conditions, rather than catching whatever swims in the sea. There are various sorts of aquaculture, representing different levels of intervention in the lifecycles of fish. There is intensive fish farming, where all the nutrition for the fish is provided. There is semi-intensive fish farming, meaning the food supply for the fish is enhanced. There is extensive fish farming, where predators and competitors are removed. Globally at present, aquaculture is divided into two main types: commercial farms and family or cooperative farms. Commercial farms combine intensive and semi-intensive methods to produce high-valued fish for domestic consumption or export, while family and cooperative farms rely on extensive and semi-intensive practices to produce low-value fish for local markets. Aquaculture provided 20% of global fisheries production in 1996. Of that percentage, over half of aquaculture production came from freshwater. The remaining portion was made up mainly of aquaculture production in marine environments, with a small fraction in brackish water.</p> <p><b>From where do farmers get food for their fish?</b><br> Much fish farming relies heavily on fish feed, that is, capturing small fish like mackerel and anchovy and feeding them to carnivorous farmed fish. In the production of the ten most commonly farmed fish, roughly 2kg of wild fish feed are required for every kilogram of farmed fish produced. This means that at the moment fish feed is further draining wild fish stocks, without even producing an equivalent mass of farmed fish. There are proposals to use soy oils instead of fish oils and, worryingly, animal byproducts (such as blood meal and bone meal). </p> <p><b>Who is doing it?</b><br> Generally, most aquaculture happens in what the UN defines as low-income, food-deficit countries. 90% of global aquaculture occurs in Asia. China is responsible for more than two-thirds of the total. Europe, North America and Japan collectively produce slightly more than 10% of global aquaculture output, but these countries consume most of the farmed seafood produced internationally. </p> <p> <b>So fish are farmed in China and eaten in Henley-on-Thames?</b><br> It depends on the sort of fish. Some fish can command higher prices because they are perceived to be tastier and more stylish, eg salmon and shrimp. This means that Asian fish farmers are tending to produce high-worth fish for export, while producing lower-value fish like carp for consumption by a poorer domestic market. </p> <p><b>So fish farmers could create hundreds of new fish and leave all the oceans free? </b><br> Some would agree. The FAO has optimistically suggested that scientific improvements in aquaculture, leading to the creation of genetically more successful fish, might be the solution to the stagnation in ocean fish stocks. A recent report in Nature (29 June 2000) suggested that aquaculture can reduce pressure on wild fisheries. For example, by increasing the production of farmed fish (ie shrimp, salmon and molluscs) - which compete commercially with wild fish - aquaculture reduces global fish prices. This could eventually reduce the commercial viability of ocean fishing, and persuade investors to reallocate funds. Other farmed fish, such as tilapia, milkfish and channel catfish, offer alternatives to overfished ocean fish such as cod, hake, haddock and pollock. </p> <p> <b>Tilapia and chips for supper, then?</b><br> The problem is that consumers frequently fail to change their tastes as quickly as fish farmers might like them to. Instead, they tend to want to continue buying cod and haddock rather than, or as well as, tilapia and milkfish, and therefore pressure on wild stocks isn't reduced at all. Wild fisheries are also highly subsidized: government subsidies approach 20-25% of global gross revenue. </p> <p><b>And what do environmentalists say?</b><br> Fish farming, although in theory adding more fish to world supplies, in fact risks further reducing wild fish stocks - through habitat destruction, changes in food web interactions, the introduction of exotic species into wild populations, the spreading of diseases from farmed to wild fish, and nutrient pollution. Farming, particularly of shrimp, has meant thousands of hectares of mangroves and coastal wetlands have been converted into shrimp and milkfish ponds. It's also difficult to persuade farmed fish to keep to their pens. Nearly half of the salmon caught by North Atlantic fishermen are of farmed origin. Farmed fish may spawn with wild fish and dilute the genetic makeup of their offspring, making them less well-adapted to their environment than their original wild parents. Diseases may also spread from farmed to wild fish. Whitespot and yellowhead viruses have caused massive losses in farmed fish in Asia. Untreated effluent containing uneaten fish feed and fish faeces may pass from fish farm areas, modifying the biogeochemical makeup of coastal waters. </p> <p><b>In conclusion? </b><br> There's a global stagnation in wild fish stocks. This has been caused by marine pollution and overfishing. It would seem necessary to reduce the pressure on ocean stocks. Aquaculture could be a way of doing that. However, without tighter controls on fish feed, escapes from fish farms and modification of habitat, aquaculture will merely worsen the global depletion of fish stocks, and could adversely affect food chains and gene pools. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional information courtesy of Euan Dunn of the RSPB.</p>",
