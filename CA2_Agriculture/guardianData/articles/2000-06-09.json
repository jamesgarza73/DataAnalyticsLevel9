      "body": "<p>Building your own home to your own specification is for most people a daunting but ultimately rewarding task. But easing the path is the growing number of lenders now willing to back your dream home with hard cash. </p> <p>Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society is the market leader for self-build home loans, with more than 10% of all of its mortgages granted to self-builders. But there are a number of other lenders entering this growing market, from the Ecology building society, a specialist in environmentally conscious homes, through to giant high street names such as Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Moneyfacts lists 31 lenders who offer finance packages for self-build. However, you will still need a reasonable reserve of cash to start the process. The main rule of thumb is that a lender will give you up to 80% of the valuation or purchase price of the plot of land and release more money to cover the cost of building in stages dependent on an ongoing valuation. Most will release the full sum of money (with a maximum of 95% of valuation) once the roof is in place and the building is near completion. </p> <p>Mortgage companies insist that the self-build project has to be for your own occupation and nearly all rule out lending against the building of flats or maisonettes. </p> <p>Plots of land for a decent-sized home rarely come cheaper than \u00a340,000-\u00a350,000, and building a 125sq m home adds at least another \u00a380,000-\u00a390,000, so anybody thinking of self-build should have at least \u00a320,000 initial capital to invest, and probably much more to finance building ahead of the staged release of mortgage finance. </p> <p>The good news is that Norwich &amp; Peterborough estimates that, on average, self-build homes cost around 20% less than buying the equivalent home on the open market. </p> <p>Before they will grant you a mortgage, lenders will want to see a number of documents: </p> <p>\u0095 Outline planning permission for the initial advance. </p> <p>\u0095 Detailed planning permission for the first stage of building finance. </p> <p>\u0095 Building regulation approval. </p> <p>They also want to know who is building it. \"Self-build is a bit of a misnomer. You can do a self-build without ever picking up a brick if you use sub-contractors, although the cost of labour can mount up,\" says N&amp;P's Alison Lipscombe. </p> <p>However, your lender will want to be satisfied that the builder or contractor is a reputable company and is registered with the NHBC. Generally speaking, self-build is not for the keen DIY amateur, although there is a growing number of house building kits on the market. </p> <p>Lenders also want to be sure that if you need to sell the property, they can recover the mortgage outstanding. Architect Heimer Salt, who formed a self-build project in Leeds to erect three terraced houses, found that big lenders were less than enthusiastic about his more radical design ideas. </p> <p>\"If you say you are doing a timber-frame building with a turf roof, they immediately put the phone down on you,\" he says. Mr Salt turned to the Ecology building society. This lends to individuals wanting to build homes with a low environmental impact in terms of energy use, pollution and saving resources. \"Additionally we ask if it will be a healthy home and cheap to run,\" says Ecology's George Penaluna. </p> <p>Once you have found a plot of land, a lender and a builder, the next stage is obtaining the staged release of funds during the building process.

      "bodyText": "Building your own home to your own specification is for most people a daunting but ultimately rewarding task. But easing the path is the growing number of lenders now willing to back your dream home with hard cash. Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society is the market leader for self-build home loans, with more than 10% of all of its mortgages granted to self-builders. But there are a number of other lenders entering this growing market, from the Ecology building society, a specialist in environmentally conscious homes, through to giant high street names such as Lloyds TSB. Moneyfacts lists 31 lenders who offer finance packages for self-build. However, you will still need a reasonable reserve of cash to start the process. The main rule of thumb is that a lender will give you up to 80% of the valuation or purchase price of the plot of land and release more money to cover the cost of building in stages dependent on an ongoing valuation. Most will release the full sum of money (with a maximum of 95% of valuation) once the roof is in place and the building is near completion. Mortgage companies insist that the self-build project has to be for your own occupation and nearly all rule out lending against the building of flats or maisonettes. Plots of land for a decent-sized home rarely come cheaper than \u00a340,000-\u00a350,000, and building a 125sq m home adds at least another \u00a380,000-\u00a390,000, so anybody thinking of self-build should have at least \u00a320,000 initial capital to invest, and probably much more to finance building ahead of the staged release of mortgage finance. The good news is that Norwich &amp; Peterborough estimates that, on average, self-build homes cost around 20% less than buying the equivalent home on the open market. Before they will grant you a mortgage, lenders will want to see a number of documents: \u0095 Outline planning permission for the initial advance. \u0095 Detailed planning permission for the first stage of building finance. \u0095 Building regulation approval. They also want to know who is building it. \"Self-build is a bit of a misnomer. You can do a self-build without ever picking up a brick if you use sub-contractors, although the cost of labour can mount up,\" says N&amp;P's Alison Lipscombe. However, your lender will want to be satisfied that the builder or contractor is a reputable company and is registered with the NHBC. Generally speaking, self-build is not for the keen DIY amateur, although there is a growing number of house building kits on the market. Lenders also want to be sure that if you need to sell the property, they can recover the mortgage outstanding. Architect Heimer Salt, who formed a self-build project in Leeds to erect three terraced houses, found that big lenders were less than enthusiastic about his more radical design ideas. \"If you say you are doing a timber-frame building with a turf roof, they immediately put the phone down on you,\" he says. Mr Salt turned to the Ecology building society. This lends to individuals wanting to build homes with a low environmental impact in terms of energy use, pollution and saving resources. \"Additionally we ask if it will be a healthy home and cheap to run,\" says Ecology's George Penaluna. Once you have found a plot of land, a lender and a builder, the next stage is obtaining the staged release of funds during the building process. For example, N&amp;P gives you 15% of the total loan amount once the foundations are in place, a further 15% at first floor joist level and 15% at wall plate level. \"At each stage the society's valuer will carry out a re-inspection before the next stage payment can be released. Architects' certificates will also be required where appropriate,\" it says. Anyone considering undertaking a self-build should also factor in other costs. The list can run on and on and includes valuation fees, the cost of connecting services such as electricity, gas and water, professional fees, VAT, stamp duty and legal costs.

The top salary bracket for laboratory-based work is around \u00a319,000.

Often it's simply a case of supply and demand. </p> <p>Psychologist Terry Kellard at Warwick Consultants says the problem with clinical psychologists is that there are just too many of them. They are also working in the notoriously badly paying public sector, as are museum curators and pathologists. </p> <p>In the charity sector it's a bit more tricky. Charities are non-profit-making organisations which simply can't pay high salaries and, anyway, charity employees are unlikely to be motivated by money in the first instance. </p> <p>But all this is missing some of the more important points.

Dan Smith, a pathologist at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, says he finds it very hard to recruit and keep staff. One job, he says, has been advertised since last October but he has yet to receive a single application. </p> <p>He also mentioned a couple who were working for him who wanted to buy a house.

Without financial support from family and friends they may find that the pay simply doesn't justify the debt. </p> <p>The government is currently getting its knickers in a twist about one A-level pupil's failure to get into Oxford to read medicine. Perhaps it should be concerned that people from similar backgrounds to this sixth-former could be priced out of certain careers as well. </p> <p><strong>Two degrees for under ten grand</strong></p> <p>David Aird, a pathologist at Oxford's John Radcliffe hospital, has two degrees yet he started work on a trainee rate of just \u00a39,600. </p> <p>This rose to \u00a312,500 a year later and will continue rising by about \u00a3500 a year, but to make any more David has to do shift work, working nights, weekends and other anti-social hours. </p> <p>The shifts boost his pay to \u00a316,500 and can be a good way around the bad pay pathologists get. The problem is that not all hospitals offer work round the clock and those that do offer it on a strictly first come first served basis, which means the only way to get on the rota is to put your name on a list and wait until someone leaves. </p> <p>David is hopeful for the future. \"I take comfort from what nurses have been able to achieve over the past few years.

      "bodyText": "Ever thought about the person who tests your blood and tissue samples to see if you have any nasty diseases or disorders? It may seem a strange question, but think about it. As the saying goes, \"it's dirty job, but someone's gotta do it\" - so who is this someone? Unfortunately, he or she is probably an overworked, underpaid and somewhat demoralised science graduate. For pathologists, as they are formally known, are paid badly - and that means really badly. To enter the profession as a graduate trainee you need to have an undergraduate degree and at least one year of postgraduate work experience, but can only expect a starting salary of between \u00a37,000 and \u00a39,500 a year. At \u00a37,000, these graduates are teetering on the edge of the minimum wage - a situation made possible by the fact that trainee schemes are excluded from minimum wage legislation. Their predicament will improve with time, but pathologists can never expect to be millionaires. The top salary bracket for laboratory-based work is around \u00a319,000. To make more than that they would have to move into management and this is usually only possible after several years or even decades in the profession. This scenario clashes somewhat with the common perception of university graduates as bright young things with very little to worry about. Unlike their parents, they will probably have a bit of debt following them around in the few years after graduation, but people assume that they are all going to walk into high-flying and high-paying jobs upon graduation anyway, and so a bit of debt would hardly be a problem.

Yes, the Wooster Group are in town. </p> <p>What that means is theatre coming as close to carnival, to circus even, as you can imagine, but with a searing intellect running through it. So House/Lights is as audacious and magical a visual spectacle as any of their productions (a set like a lab, only with balloon-like electric lights hanging down and swaying in the foreground; six television screens; moments of almost giddy dancing and prancing across the stage), but it has a rare intelligence not only in its blending and bending of odd-bedfellow texts, but in every visual detail, every sound. </p> <p>The core to the drama is Faust's encounter with the Devil, as retold by Stein in her 1939 libretto Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, in which Faust sells his soul to invent electricity. This is paralleled with a dodgy 1964 B-movie, in which Olga (played by Suzzy Roche, who is also the Devil in the Stein) makes Elaine (Kate Valk, playing Faust too) in her own wicked image. The Stein is retold, largely in monologue by Valk with a Betty Boop hairdo and girly voice, while scenes from the film are re-enacted on stage as they appear on screen. The two narratives chase each other, collide hilariously and, only together, make some strange, perfect sense. </p> <p>Big questions lurk, about power and corruption, and more specifically about women and power, but it's what the Woosters make out of an avant-garde plotless wonder and an over-plotted hammy flick that dazzles, makes you catch your breath. </p> <p> Ends tonight.

The core to the drama is Faust's encounter with the Devil, as retold by Stein in her 1939 libretto Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, in which Faust sells his soul to invent electricity. This is paralleled with a dodgy 1964 B-movie, in which Olga (played by Suzzy Roche, who is also the Devil in the Stein) makes Elaine (Kate Valk, playing Faust too) in her own wicked image. The Stein is retold, largely in monologue by Valk with a Betty Boop hairdo and girly voice, while scenes from the film are re-enacted on stage as they appear on screen. The two narratives chase each other, collide hilariously and, only together, make some strange, perfect sense. Big questions lurk, about power and corruption, and more specifically about women and power, but it's what the Woosters make out of an avant-garde plotless wonder and an over-plotted hammy flick that dazzles, makes you catch your breath. Ends tonight. Box office: 0141-287 3900.",

But Petipa wouldn't recognise much in ENB's current production of his ballet - which is just as director Derek Deane planned. This, after all, is ballet for the people, not for purists: scaled up for the vast circular stage of the Albert Hall and with spectacle, not choreography, driving the evening. </p> <p>Since this is the third classic that Deane has staged this way, it's wearisome to rehearse the familiar arguments - accessibility and fun traded against the distancing effect of the huge venue, and the violation of classical dance principles imposed by the in-the-round format. But for Beauty, the most delicately constructed of all the classics, the trade-off proves the least convincing. Take Carabosse, a role tarted up by Deane for the dubious talents of ex-Kirov babe Anastasia Volochkova. In tra ditional stagings this mad, bad fairy is already a riot: she sweeps the stage with her grotesque cohorts, and her power is articulated in the witty mime with which she viciously satirises other, prissier fairies. Deane, who has excised most of Petipa's original text, has tried to update this mime, but his resort to rampant kicking and preening looks neither sexy nor dangerous, rather as if Carabosse is having an alcoholic tantrum. </p> <p>Much of the new choreogra phy is almost as weak: the Cat and Blue Bird pas de deux have been re-written to ugly and unmusical effect and although the Fairy variations in the Prologue have some very pretty steps, why bother when the originals served so well? More Petipa survives in the choreography for the lead couple, and while it's irritating to have the ballerina and her Prince constantly revolving to face all their audience (leaving us staring at Aurora's knickers during parts of the Rose Ada gio) there are moments where we can still admire the assured performance of the very young, very tiny Erina Takahashi. She has tremendous power, and if she looks somewhat bland in this Beauty, she obviously has huge potential. </p> <p>The production's other consolation is a clever trick of the staging. Though much of the design is an unperiod assortment of acid-toned costumes in cheap-looking fabrics, the back wall of the Albert Hall has been disguised as the facade of a huge castle.

But others, including Fidelity and the planned Gartmore/M&amp;G/Jupiter/Thread-needle tie-up, also need IFA corner shops for sales and may be less price competitive with fewer no-load funds. However, they might offer better facilities. US players, such as Charles Schwab and E-Trade, have investment research material, asset allocation assistance, tax reporting help and even a \"college saver program\" for educational expenses. Duncan Coombe of Investec Guinness Flight believes \"supermarkets have a clear role in the UK. A good one really adds value but a bad site falls into fund overload - too many funds with just a listing and little or no added value. And that's no use to anyone.\"",

Living just four yards away from the river, Pam Parnell and her family felt the full force of Mother Nature's wrath. </p> <p>At one point her end-of-terrace house was under several feet of filthy, foul-smelling water. She says the total bill for repairing the damage and replacing waterlogged possessions is likely to be around \u00a310,000. </p> <p>Mrs Parnell was woken late on Saturday night by one of her sons, who warned that the river was extremely high and was starting to come through the walls at the back of the house. She and her husband Stephen started frantically moving various items to safety, but it wasn't long before the water was pouring in through the front and back doors. </p> <p>\"We just started to try and move as much stuff as we possibly could. My mother is here on holiday and she was helping as well. We were trying to get stuff upstairs but within a quarter of an hour there was nearly 4ft of water in the house,\" she says. </p> <p>\"We managed to salvage one television, a video recorder and photographs. I took out the drawers and put them on the top of units. Then we grabbed some candles, cans of pop, biscuits and crisps, and went upstairs.\" </p> <p>The waters started subsiding later that morning, at which point the family came down and surveyed their sodden home. \"I phoned up my insurance company and they came round on Sunday. They took the carpets out for us and sprayed this stuff down for bugs and things. The water that came in was filthy and foul. A loss adjuster came out as well. They walked in, had a good look round and said 'The whole lot's got to go'.\" </p> <p>Items that will have to be replaced include a three-piece suite, washing machine, freezer, tumble dryer, two televisions and a video recorder. </p> <p>\"My kitchen looks like it is going to have to be replaced - all the doors have warped. The floors are probably going to have to be replaced, and there is going to be plasterwork that needs to be done. It's going to take months.\" </p> <p>The Parnells are hoping to carry on living there while their home dries out, as it is quite large and some parts were less affected than others. Luckily, as they were fully covered, they can let their insurance company sort out the financial side of the mess. </p> <p>Mrs Parnell is all too aware how crucial it is to be properly insured - she works for Todmorden firm Donald Rigg Insurance Brokers, which has a lot of clients in the town and was this week deluged with calls from people who suffered flood damage. </p> <p>Despite the growing number of bad weather incidents in recent years, from flash floods to tornadoes, it is estimated that 25% of households - 6m homes - are not covered by contents insurance. This figure rises to 42% in London. </p> <p>\"People say, 'I don't need insurance, nothing is ever going to happen', or 'I haven't got much'. You don't realise what you've got in your house until you actually sit down and really look,\" says Mrs Parnell. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that while no one can control the weather, there are things homeowners can do to reduce the risk of suffering flood damage. In the event of a flood alert, anything that can be moved easily should be taken upstairs. </p> <p>You may also wish to move your car or caravan on to higher ground for a couple of days. Move yourselves upstairs too if necessary, making sure you take food, warm clothing, a torch, first aid kit and important phone numbers with you. </p> <p>If you are unlucky enough to be hit by floods, the priority should be to stop the damage getting worse, says the ABI. Contact your insurance company as soon as possible - most have 24-hour emergency helplines. They may be able to send someone round to do repairs. </p> <p>\"If you need work done, get it done,\" says Ian Frater at insurer CGU. However, keep hold of receipts for all work carried out as they will be needed when you make your claim. </p> <p>Other advice includes: </p> <p>\u0095 Don't use electricity or gas or drink tap water until the all-clear is given. </p> <p>\u0095 Remove sodden floor coverings and wash down affected floors and walls with disinfectant or water. </p> <p>\u0095 Leave as many doors, windows and cupboards open as possible, and try to get the warm air circulating. </p> <p>\u0095 Pull furniture away from walls, and oil all of your hinges and locks to prevent them corroding. </p> <p>Ideally, insurers like to see everything in situ, but use common sense - if a carpet is absolutely sopping wet, leaving it down may well just make things worse, so it may be better to shift it into the garden. However, you should take a photograph before you do this. </p> <p>Most buildings and contents policies cover the cost of alternative accommodation if your home is so badly damaged that you have to move out while repairs are carried out. </p> <p>Finally, don't be in a hurry to redecorate - it may take weeks or even months for walls and floors to dry out completely. </p> <p>\"Very often the damage you see initially is only the tip of the iceberg. Once the house has dried out it can be 12-18 months before you see shrinkage in wood panelling,\" warns Mr Frater. </p> <p>\"But don't be frightened of going back to your insurer at that point. If it is damage that can rightly be put down to the original flooding, then it is covered by the policy.\"</p>",

For all that Boo.com failed, the response of their staff suggests Malmsten and Leander did provide such meaning. One high-visibility failure should not suggest that the future of e-commerce lies in reasserting traditional management disciplines. \u0095 Carole Pemberton is managing consultant at Career Matters.

Portugal's Everton defender Abel Xavier has set the standard off the pitch by dying his hair and beard bright yellow. </p> <p>\u0095 England's match against Portugal will be refereed by the Swede Anders Frisk, who was in charge for Kevin Keegan's side's 2-1 victory over Belgium last October. Scotland's Hugh Dallas will referee Turkey and Italy on Sunday and England's representative, Graham Poll, begins with France against the Czech Republic a week today. </p> <p>\u0095 Italy's injury problems continue to stack up after Alessandro Nesta, Gianluca Zambrotta and Paolo Negro were all injured in training. Zambrotta has hurt his right calf and will be replaced by Fiorentina's Angelo di Livio if he fails to recover in time for Italy's opening match against Turkey on Sunday. Negro has an ankle problem and Nesta injured his left shin. The Italians have already lost their first-choice striker and goalkeeper, Christian Vieri and Gianluigi Buffon respectively. </p> <p>\u0095 A court has given Yugoslavia the go-ahead to play in the tournament. Kosovo-Albanian associations in Belgium had sought to prevent the national team from competing, citing a European Union resolution which keeps representatives of the Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic's regime from entering other EU nations. </p> <p>\u0095 Concerns over security have been taken to the extreme by the local authority in Amsterdam which has banned the wearing of balaclavas in the town for the duration of the tournament.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 England will be hoping that Romania's run of bad luck since arriving in Belgium continues when the sides meet in Charleroi on Tuesday week. The players were forced to wait for 10 minutes before clearing customs, leaving the captain Gheorghe Hagi saying they had been treated like \"criminals\"; just before their arrival for their first training session a nearby car exploded and burst into flames; and, when they finally got going, Catalin Haldan was involved in a heavy collision with Miodrag Belodedici and knocked unconscious. \u0095 Luis Figo and Nuno Gomes scored hat-tricks as Portugal warmed up for their opening match against England by beating the Dutch part-timers DVS 33 11-0. Portugal's Everton defender Abel Xavier has set the standard off the pitch by dying his hair and beard bright yellow. \u0095 England's match against Portugal will be refereed by the Swede Anders Frisk, who was in charge for Kevin Keegan's side's 2-1 victory over Belgium last October. Scotland's Hugh Dallas will referee Turkey and Italy on Sunday and England's representative, Graham Poll, begins with France against the Czech Republic a week today. \u0095 Italy's injury problems continue to stack up after Alessandro Nesta, Gianluca Zambrotta and Paolo Negro were all injured in training. Zambrotta has hurt his right calf and will be replaced by Fiorentina's Angelo di Livio if he fails to recover in time for Italy's opening match against Turkey on Sunday. Negro has an ankle problem and Nesta injured his left shin. The Italians have already lost their first-choice striker and goalkeeper, Christian Vieri and Gianluigi Buffon respectively. \u0095 A court has given Yugoslavia the go-ahead to play in the tournament. Kosovo-Albanian associations in Belgium had sought to prevent the national team from competing, citing a European Union resolution which keeps representatives of the Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milosevic's regime from entering other EU nations. \u0095 Concerns over security have been taken to the extreme by the local authority in Amsterdam which has banned the wearing of balaclavas in the town for the duration of the tournament. Other rules include fines for climbing on fences and allowing Amsterdam's mayor to redirect traffic in a bid to maintain order. \u0095 Sander Westerveld will face a church v country conflict if Holland live up to their billing as tournament favourites as he is the best man at his brother Wouter's wedding on June 30, two days before the final. \"The ceremony is at one o'clock in the afternoon and, if I was given permission to go, that would be all I would attend,\" said the goalkeeper. \"I would not go to the reception.\" \u0095 Lothar Matth\u00e4us seems certain to play in Germany's opening game against Romania on Sunday after recovering from a thigh injury.

A nearby wig shop offers a discount to students. In East Flanders there is a poodle parlour with the arresting English name Dogs' Toilet.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, West Flanders boasts a whole museum devoted to bread, rolls, cakes and icing. One of the nation's biggest-selling ice lollies is called Big Nuts. People have net curtains in their windows embroidered with pictures of dinosaurs and straw post boxes in the shape of beehives. In Brussels the Museum of Underpants is said to have reopened after a period of closure. The owner is a friend of Noel Godin, the Belgian performance artist best known for smacking Bill Gates in the face with a cream pie.</p> <p>There is a smattering of the bizarre in the Netherlands, too. How else can you describe a theme park of Biblical landmarks erected on a couple of hundred acres of marsh near Eindhoven, or the popular sport of pole-sitting? Generally speaking, though, it might be true to say that while Belgians have surrealism, the Dutch have efficiency. While Belgians, fed up with state corruption and incompetence, berate their nation as \"a third world country in the heart of Europe\", their northern neighbours sit back, confident in the knowledge that everything works properly in Holland.</p> <p>And it's kept clean too. As far back as the 17th century, Holland's cleanliness was a source of wonder to visitors from the rest of Europe. Even members of Cromwell's puritan regime were impressed by the sparkling streets and the gleam of Dutch door hinges. A certain looseness may have crept into Amsterdam in recent years, but the rest of the nation remains impressively spotless. The morning after a night of disturbances in central Maastricht, a friend went down to see the extent of the damage. He found nothing. \"In the Netherlands,\" he concluded, \"even the hooligans clear up after themselves.\"</p> <p>Cafes proliferate in both nations. However, the Netherland's Calvinist values gave local drinkers a tougher time of it than they had in Catholic Belgium (though the Protestants also banned opera, so at least they did some good). As a result, the per capita ratio of cafes is roughly three times higher there. Belgian prices are generally lower too, which explains the string of bars and drink warehouses that line the border like a licenced version of the Maginot Line.</p> <p>The Dutch also lag behind when it comes to variety of beers they make, though their nation's merchant past has helped them promote the ones they do produce, such as Heineken, very successfully to the world at large. Belgian brewers are relentlessly inventive, spicing their ales with everything from coriander to woodruff. In most cafes you will find at least two dozen to choose from. In specialist establishments the list can run into four figures. Holland, though, is the only place where you can drink one that's spiked with cannabis. Well, legally anyway.</p> <p>The Belgians take eating very seriously. The best English-language book on the subject of the local gastronomy is called, with admirable and thoroughly Flemish straightforwardness, The \"You Always Eat Well In Belgium\" Cookery Book. Dutch gardens are full of flowers; Belgian gardens are full of livestock. Just outside Brussels I once came across a man who had chickens, pigeons, rabbits and a pregnant sheep in his suburban backyard. The only vegetation apart from grass was a herb patch and a row of onions. It wasn't very pretty, but try making a decent stew out of tulips.</p> <p>Chips are a unifying culinary item. The Belgian variety is justifiably famous, but the Dutch version is just as good. You can buy them at a street corner shop or mobile caravan. Depending on your whereabouts, you might eat them with frogs' legs, snails, shrimp croquettes or sausage. You can have them on their own, dolloped with mayonnaise or, if you are in Wallonia (the French-speaking south of Belgium), in a \"mitrailleuse\", the local answer to the chip butty.</p> <p>Beer, chips and football. As my German colleague remarked, \"Why go further?\"</p>",

People have net curtains in their windows embroidered with pictures of dinosaurs and straw post boxes in the shape of beehives. In Brussels the Museum of Underpants is said to have reopened after a period of closure. The owner is a friend of Noel Godin, the Belgian performance artist best known for smacking Bill Gates in the face with a cream pie. There is a smattering of the bizarre in the Netherlands, too. How else can you describe a theme park of Biblical landmarks erected on a couple of hundred acres of marsh near Eindhoven, or the popular sport of pole-sitting? Generally speaking, though, it might be true to say that while Belgians have surrealism, the Dutch have efficiency. While Belgians, fed up with state corruption and incompetence, berate their nation as \"a third world country in the heart of Europe\", their northern neighbours sit back, confident in the knowledge that everything works properly in Holland. And it's kept clean too. As far back as the 17th century, Holland's cleanliness was a source of wonder to visitors from the rest of Europe. Even members of Cromwell's puritan regime were impressed by the sparkling streets and the gleam of Dutch door hinges. A certain looseness may have crept into Amsterdam in recent years, but the rest of the nation remains impressively spotless. The morning after a night of disturbances in central Maastricht, a friend went down to see the extent of the damage. He found nothing. \"In the Netherlands,\" he concluded, \"even the hooligans clear up after themselves.\" Cafes proliferate in both nations. However, the Netherland's Calvinist values gave local drinkers a tougher time of it than they had in Catholic Belgium (though the Protestants also banned opera, so at least they did some good). As a result, the per capita ratio of cafes is roughly three times higher there. Belgian prices are generally lower too, which explains the string of bars and drink warehouses that line the border like a licenced version of the Maginot Line. The Dutch also lag behind when it comes to variety of beers they make, though their nation's merchant past has helped them promote the ones they do produce, such as Heineken, very successfully to the world at large. Belgian brewers are relentlessly inventive, spicing their ales with everything from coriander to woodruff. In most cafes you will find at least two dozen to choose from. In specialist establishments the list can run into four figures. Holland, though, is the only place where you can drink one that's spiked with cannabis. Well, legally anyway. The Belgians take eating very seriously. The best English-language book on the subject of the local gastronomy is called, with admirable and thoroughly Flemish straightforwardness, The \"You Always Eat Well In Belgium\" Cookery Book. Dutch gardens are full of flowers; Belgian gardens are full of livestock. Just outside Brussels I once came across a man who had chickens, pigeons, rabbits and a pregnant sheep in his suburban backyard. The only vegetation apart from grass was a herb patch and a row of onions. It wasn't very pretty, but try making a decent stew out of tulips. Chips are a unifying culinary item. The Belgian variety is justifiably famous, but the Dutch version is just as good. You can buy them at a street corner shop or mobile caravan. Depending on your whereabouts, you might eat them with frogs' legs, snails, shrimp croquettes or sausage. You can have them on their own, dolloped with mayonnaise or, if you are in Wallonia (the French-speaking south of Belgium), in a \"mitrailleuse\", the local answer to the chip butty. Beer, chips and football. As my German colleague remarked, \"Why go further?\"",

Arsenal's self-confessed porn aficionado appeals because he'll not only mop up any of his strikers' near misses, he'll also take the occasional unprovoked pop goalwards.</p> <p>Italy v Turkey: Turkey to win 4/1 (\u00a310)</p> <p>Turkey are one of the most under-rated and overpriced teams of the tournament - the midfield know each other like brothers rather than distant cousins and when he's on song Hakan Sukur can bury anything, including Italy's chances of winning their opening match. Without Vieri, the Azzuri may look a bit pale and the likes of Inzaghi and Del Piero have not been too sharp of late.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bluesq.com/bet?AFF_ID=2\">Fancy a wager?</a> </p> <p><strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p>Belgium v Sweden: 0-0 correct score 5/1 (\u00a35)</p> <p>First of all I must confess that I know bugger all about betting. I would never go into a bookies just in case some old man persuaded me to put all my wages on a lame donkey. I know slightly more about that game they call football, however, and as far as I can remember, opening games in major tournaments aren't usually that exciting (Argentina crashing to Cameroon aside). So that's why my first wager, all \u00a35 of it, is going on a 0-0 draw between Belgium and Sweden at odds of 5-1.</p> <p>Holland v Czech Republic: Patrick Kluivert last goalscorer 4/1 (\u00a35)</p> <p>For a mug like myself, Sunday is much more confusing.

      "bodyText": "Four men, each with a habit of throwing good money after bad. One online bookmaker, foolish enough to provide each of the men with \u00a350 to squander. One goal: to be the last man standing after 23 days of daily football betting. It's You Bet Your Life, brought to you by BlueSq. Mike Hodgkinson Belgium v Sweden: Frederik Ljungberg first scorer 12/1 (\u00a35) Sweden are not the quite the force they were in qualifying but they won't let in too many goals during the tournament, which always makes them worth considering for first scorers. Arsenal's self-confessed porn aficionado appeals because he'll not only mop up any of his strikers' near misses, he'll also take the occasional unprovoked pop goalwards. Italy v Turkey: Turkey to win 4/1 (\u00a310) Turkey are one of the most under-rated and overpriced teams of the tournament - the midfield know each other like brothers rather than distant cousins and when he's on song Hakan Sukur can bury anything, including Italy's chances of winning their opening match. Without Vieri, the Azzuri may look a bit pale and the likes of Inzaghi and Del Piero have not been too sharp of late. Fancy a wager? Paul MacInnes Belgium v Sweden: 0-0 correct score 5/1 (\u00a35) First of all I must confess that I know bugger all about betting. I would never go into a bookies just in case some old man persuaded me to put all my wages on a lame donkey. I know slightly more about that game they call football, however, and as far as I can remember, opening games in major tournaments aren't usually that exciting (Argentina crashing to Cameroon aside). So that's why my first wager, all \u00a35 of it, is going on a 0-0 draw between Belgium and Sweden at odds of 5-1. Holland v Czech Republic: Patrick Kluivert last goalscorer 4/1 (\u00a35) For a mug like myself, Sunday is much more confusing. Should I back moody Nic Anelka to bag the first goal for France against Denmark? Or pick Turkey (at a tasty 9/2) to have a half-time lead against Italy? Eventually I decided on neither and put another fiver (even units are best, I've decided) on the match of the day: Holland v Czech Republic. I'm not the biggest fan of big Pat Kluivert, but he seems to like playing in orange and I've backed him at 4-1 to score the last goal of the game. \u00a310 down, \u00a340 to go... Fancy a wager? Scott Murray Belgium v Sweden: 1-1 correct score 5/1 (\u00a35) Tournament curtain-raisers always seem to be low-scoring, tedious affairs which, by the time sixty minutes are up, make you pine for the opening ceremony. As neither Belgium or Sweden are big on free scoring or entertainment, it's 1-1 all the way for me, one midway through each half to ensure a total lack of drama. And if I'm wrong, at least we get a classic match. Unless it's 0-0, of course, in which case we'll all be sorry. Italy v Turkey: Italy to win 4/6 (\u00a310) Now to try to claw back some ground after yesterday's disaster. Turkish football may be on something of a high, but Galatasaray didn't exactly set the world alight with the manner in which they won the Uefa Cup. On the other hand, they did hilariously plonk Milan out of Europe in the early stages of this year's Champions League. But the Italians have too many good players for their recent poor run to continue, so a vote in favour of the big boys is my reckless shout here. Fancy a wager? Sean Ingle Belgium v Sweden: 2-3 goals scored 10/11 (\u00a35) Opening games have a reputation for being soulless and goalless, but the evidence doesn't really back this up. The first game in the past three European Championships for instance (1988: West Germany 1-1 Italy, 1992: Sweden 1-1 France, 1996: England 1-1 Switzerland) have all been scoring draws. Why should it be any different when Belgium play Sweden? That's why I've resisted the temptation to back the Red Devils and instead bet \u00a35 on game containing two or three goals.

So even if Sweden play it tight, it's not unreasonable to expect the net to bulge. Win double France and Holland to win 8/13 and 4/6 (\u00a35) On Sunday I go for a \u00a35 win double: France (8/13) to beat Denmark, and Holland (4/6) to beat Czech Republic. Together the double pays just under two-and-a-half to one, which spells value in anybody's language. Fancy a wager?",

Koogan then went on to insist that even if Shearer doesn't make the first game, \"he has five days before the next game. That is a plus point with Alan.\" And everyone else as well, surely?</p> <p>In fact Koog was so confident that Shearer would be OK, he refused to get drawn into the debate over which player he would bring into the squad should his top striker need replacing. \"I don't think we have to go down that line with Alan Shearer,\" he said. \"If he does not make the first game, he will be fit for the second game,\" he reiterated, before anybody could mention Chris Sutton.</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaa.co.uk/euro2000\">http://www.theaa.co.uk/euro2000</a> Free one-stop information shop for fans travelling to Euro 2000.

Three men carrying hunting knives and a crossbow have been apprehended by Belgian police after they were spotted in a Brussels park taking photographs of each other as they posed with their weapons. Who are these sick, twisted, maniacal individuals? Are they part of a sinister organisation hell-bent on causing trouble wherever they go?</p> <p>\"Our journalists were investigating the widespread availability of lethal weapons on the eve of Euro 2000,\" explained a spokeswoman for the News Of The World, the employers of the men in question. \"The three men were engaged in an entirely legitimate journalistic exercise in the public interest,\" she continued as a nation belly-laughed as one. The Belgian police weren't as amused, however. \"Nobody can carry weapons without a valid reason or authorisation,\" a spokesman said earlier today. \"They were carrying hunting knives - and they were not hunting so they were breaking the law.\"</p> <p>As ever, the News Of The World demanded instant justice. \"We are extremely concerned at their detention and have taken immediate steps with the authorities to secure their prompt release,\" whined their spokesperson. And sure enough, the hacks were quickly freed without charge. The Fiver, however, holds no truck with this sort of wishy-washy liberal posturing. Our message is simple, and our message is clear: take their passports away, put 'em in jail and throw away the key.

However, if it means that every footballer in Europe will suddenly sit up and take notice of Kelvin Koogan's brave boys, instead of clutching their stomachs and laughing hysterically until they cough up half a lung, we're all for it.</p> <p>So thank God for an email which today encouraged just about everyone in England to go to the website of Italian paper Gazetta dello Sport and vote for Kelvin's men in their 'Who will win Euro 2000?' online poll. Early this morning, someone with nothing better to do noticed that England had polled less than 4 percent, and, determined to restore English pride, sent out an email entitled 'Lord Kitchener says Your Country Needs You', complete with instructions on how to make a mockery of the democratic process.</p> <p>Sure enough, the whole country soon was logging on at http://www.gazzetta.it, clicking the \"Inghiltera\" button, hitting \"vota\", and then looking at the \"resultati\". But was it worth the effort? Well, at last look, England were sitting pretty on 67 percent while the useless old Italians had only polled 11 percent. Now that's bound to have the whole of Europe on the run. Resultato!</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal have joined Manchester United and Chelsea in the chase for Gareth Southgate. The Aston Villa defender is expected to fetch \u00a310m.</p> <p>Aston Villa's defence could be further weakened by the departure of Gareth Barry, supposedly a \u00a310m target for Manchester United.</p> <p>Everton and Coventry are negotiating a swap deal involving Don Hutchison and Noel Whelan.

Koogan then went on to insist that even if Shearer doesn't make the first game, \"he has five days before the next game. That is a plus point with Alan.\" And everyone else as well, surely? In fact Koog was so confident that Shearer would be OK, he refused to get drawn into the debate over which player he would bring into the squad should his top striker need replacing. \"I don't think we have to go down that line with Alan Shearer,\" he said. \"If he does not make the first game, he will be fit for the second game,\" he reiterated, before anybody could mention Chris Sutton.

Three men carrying hunting knives and a crossbow have been apprehended by Belgian police after they were spotted in a Brussels park taking photographs of each other as they posed with their weapons. Who are these sick, twisted, maniacal individuals? Are they part of a sinister organisation hell-bent on causing trouble wherever they go? \"Our journalists were investigating the widespread availability of lethal weapons on the eve of Euro 2000,\" explained a spokeswoman for the News Of The World, the employers of the men in question. \"The three men were engaged in an entirely legitimate journalistic exercise in the public interest,\" she continued as a nation belly-laughed as one. The Belgian police weren't as amused, however. \"Nobody can carry weapons without a valid reason or authorisation,\" a spokesman said earlier today. \"They were carrying hunting knives - and they were not hunting so they were breaking the law.\" As ever, the News Of The World demanded instant justice. \"We are extremely concerned at their detention and have taken immediate steps with the authorities to secure their prompt release,\" whined their spokesperson. And sure enough, the hacks were quickly freed without charge. The Fiver, however, holds no truck with this sort of wishy-washy liberal posturing. Our message is simple, and our message is clear: take their passports away, put 'em in jail and throw away the key. That's the only language these scum understand! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We thought it would be nice to offer an orange coffin in the coming weeks.\" A spokesman for Bijnen undertakers in Dutch town Vught, revealing his company's Euro 2000 special. Holland are in the group of death after all. A QUICK FIX Vote-rigging. It's not big, and it's not clever. However, if it means that every footballer in Europe will suddenly sit up and take notice of Kelvin Koogan's brave boys, instead of clutching their stomachs and laughing hysterically until they cough up half a lung, we're all for it. So thank God for an email which today encouraged just about everyone in England to go to the website of Italian paper Gazetta dello Sport and vote for Kelvin's men in their 'Who will win Euro 2000?' online poll. Early this morning, someone with nothing better to do noticed that England had polled less than 4 percent, and, determined to restore English pride, sent out an email entitled 'Lord Kitchener says Your Country Needs You', complete with instructions on how to make a mockery of the democratic process. Sure enough, the whole country soon was logging on at http://www.gazzetta.it, clicking the \"Inghiltera\" button, hitting \"vota\", and then looking at the \"resultati\". But was it worth the effort? Well, at last look, England were sitting pretty on 67 percent while the useless old Italians had only polled 11 percent. Now that's bound to have the whole of Europe on the run. Resultato! THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal have joined Manchester United and Chelsea in the chase for Gareth Southgate. The Aston Villa defender is expected to fetch \u00a310m. Aston Villa's defence could be further weakened by the departure of Gareth Barry, supposedly a \u00a310m target for Manchester United. Everton and Coventry are negotiating a swap deal involving Don Hutchison and Noel Whelan. Both players are on the transfer list and both could leave on a Bosman free next year - the clubs are attempting to ensure they do not lose money on their investments. NEWS IN BRIEF The winners of the rights to show Premiership football for the next three years will be announced next Wednesday. George Burley has confirmed that Richard Wright will be told to sign a new deal or he will be sold. \"If Richard won't sign his contract he will be put up for sale,\" revealed Burley. \"We are quite clear about this. The negotiations have been going on for two years now and we need to know his intentions.\" Romania captain Gheorghe Hagi has been given the all-clear to face Germany on Monday. Hagi has been troubled by a groin injury and there were fears he might miss all three group games. But team doctor Pompiliu Popescu insisted today: \"Hagi will play on Monday.\" TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC1: Three Lions (10.30pm) England don't do very well in a tournament and lose.

The right to partake in non-sexual public nudity, while not actively promoted, has not been an indictable offence in Denmark, Holland or Germany for a generation. It is legal to sunbathe nude in parks, on beaches and on private property without fear of prosecution. <br><br> Like all good legislation with goodwill from both sides, this is a two way thing. Few citizens would wish to go to the supermarket naked. Most nudists respect other people*s opposition to nudity. In the UK there is no law forbidding public nudity, but several laws are used to prosecute public nakedness. Nudists apprehended on beaches are reprimanded and fined with Victorian legislation also used to prosecute flashers. Unsurprisingly, they feel insulted by this association with lewd public behaviour. <br><br> Lately, the Public Order Act (Section 4) has been used against some nudists. The nudist is now looking for equality under the law. Some nudists are getting vociferous. Underlying the whole philosophy of social nudism, scanty as it may seem to outsiders, is a physical and psychological revulsion against the mandatory wearing of clothes. The prospect of the UK legal system being advised by Europe to recognise the legality of non-sexual public nudity has excited many nudists. Parallels with persecuted gays in the 60s have been made. OK, we nudists are a little behind, but we are in the queues at Strasbourg.<br><br> Yours sincerely, <br> Mark Nisbet <br> Editor of Health &amp; Efficiency Magazine <br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Mr Nisbet, </b><br><br></p> <p>The UK is much like other European jurisdictions, including those you quote. No worse, no better. But I boggle at the idea of a physical and mental revulsion against the mandatory wearing of clothes. Is their revulsion brought about by the mandatoriness? <br><br> If we gave them the right to take their clothes off whenever and wherever they wished, would this cure the problem? Could they bank the right without needing to use it, so that (provided they knew they could take their clothes off if the desire seized them) they would be happy to be covered up? Or are they saying that they have some physical or psychological condition which prevents them from wearing clothes? These are lawyer's questions, but they do have a point. I cannot see that it helps naturists to be identified as victims of a mildly ridiculous condition for which we have to make allowances. <br><br> Yes, there are public decency offences and also provisions allowing the police to prevent breaches of the peace. And such provisions are used, including possibly last week at the Freedom To Be Yourself demonstration in Brighton. But surely there are few naturists who wish to make exhibitions of themselves. It is a question of balancing rights. With a bit of discretion naturists can, and have for years, been able to do things without having to wear clothes. In no jurisdiction can they wonder about the streets naked and expect not to be challenged. <br><br> It is really how far this freedom should become a public right. Far be it from me to stop you from wishing to address these issues to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. But I am intrigued to know what you will ask for.<br><br> Yours sincerely, <br> Sue Ashtiany <br> Solicitor <br><br></p> <p> <b>Dear Sue, </b><br><br> I am not overstating things. Nudists under UK law experience far more prosecutions than their counterparts in the rest of Europe. In 1998 the East Riding of Yorkshire council attempted to ban nudity along 96 miles of the coastline and backed up its prejudice with warden patrols. In 1998 a Gloucester man was fined for walking nude in his garden. In 1999 a male nude sunbather on Ainsdale beach, Lancashire, was prosecuted. His wife, also arrested, was not charged. <br><br> This sort of thing does not happen in Holland or Denmark, and elsewhere, because the right to be publicly naked, however legally circumscribed, exists. In Munich's English Gardens, nudists attract complaints not because they are nude but for making too much noise splashing in the lake. In continental Europe simple human nudity, in time and place, is no big deal. The overall atmosphere is more relaxed. In the UK the policy has always been to tolerate nudity providing it is confined to remote private woodland clubs. As soon as nudists use beaches and parks simple nudity provokes the law. <br><br> A mandatory clothing policy is what nudists feel operates against their enjoyment of public places where to be nude is practical and desirable. The beach is an obvious place, the countryside less so. On many southern European beaches the clothed and the nude happily share the sands. This is not allowed here. Nudity is a state of mind and body that is liberating. Nudists are vexed by segregation and angered at being one notch up from sexual exhibitionists in the eyes of the law. Nudists require the ability to pursue discreet nudity in public free of such constraints. <br><br> Yours sincerely, <br> Mark Nisbet <br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Mark,</b><br><br> I feel that you are confusing several issues. In Denmark, Article 232 of the Criminal Code can and has been used to prosecute naturists. More commonly the matter is left to local police discretion under the Police Code. This is similar to what we do here where police will act under their general powers to prevent breaches of the peace rather than use more severe powers under criminal statutes. <br><br> What you are saying is that in most areas in the UK we aren't happy to share our public parks with people wandering about in the nude over the age of about five. We do have places within public areas where people can take all their clothes off. More interestingly, the question you originally raised was about bringing a claim under the European Convention on Human Rights. You are now talking about edging along the limits of discretion. What I am not sure about is which human right you are asserting. What about those people who have a physical and psychological revulsion against being forced to wear clothes? How do they fit in with your rather more gentle idea that we should not cavil at a few more people taking off a few more clothes on sunny days? <br><br> Where exactly are you going?<br><br> Yours, <br> Sue Ashtiany <br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Sue,</b><br><br> The point I'm trying to make is that the moral and legal climate in the UK is very harsh when it comes to public nudity. It encourages apprehension and fear among those nudists who are less bold than the very small minority of nudists with an attitude, who go nude wherever they chose. What this means for the average nudist, who is not confrontational, is that they feel their right to self-expression, their belief system about the moral, spiritual and recreational value of social nudity, and their ability to express their beliefs, are being suppressed. These are the human rights that are under constant attack. <br><br> Social nudity cannot develop in a climate of fear in which local authorities, landowners, and some members of the public readily call in the police to deal with low key, innocent public nudity. This they do and treat nudists as sexual miscreants using the Vagrancy Act 1824 and the Town Police Clauses Act 1856. It is time for these laws to be reassessed; being nude in a public place should not become an offence against public decency. Perhaps it would be best if we nudists became a religious order, produced a manifesto and became like the Sadhus in India, claiming religious minority privileges. What do you think is our best next move?<br><br> Yours, <br> Mark <br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Mark,</b><br><br> The rights of one group of people have to co-exist with another group's expectations and freedoms. This is the margin of appreciation that is built into human rights law. Concepts of decency differ at different times and places.

Rather then being made up of jaded fashion editors and po-faced buyers, it's made up of mum, dad, granny, lil' sister and hundreds of over-excited students. The atmosphere makes for one of the most exciting weeks on the fashion calendar. You can gasp at Gucci, you can marvel at McQueen, but only Graduate Fashion Week will bring a lump to your throat and a tear to your eye. All that hard work - three years of slogging your guts out over a steaming toile - just to take a five-minute spin on the catwalk and hope that someone, somewhere, proclaims you the next Galliano. </p> <p>\"What paper are you from?\" asked one mum at the Surrey show. \"My daughter is called Kathryn. Will you be mentioning her?\" </p> <p>As a general rule of thumb, the more ridiculous the creation, the louder the cheers from the parents. They don't want to see well-cut trouser suits; they want to bask in the spectacle of it all. \"Look, Jim. Somebody's made a wooden codpiece! Isn't that marvellous!\" But all in all, this was a very commercial year. The proverbial three-legged trousers were almost entirely absent, though there was a distressing predilection for plastic, diaphanous, seethrough chiffon and stiff felted wool, none of which are particularly easy to wear. </p> <p>Central St Martins is the only show the fasherati bothers to turn up to, because of its track record of producing McQueen, McCartney and Galliano. Hell, even Prince Andrew showed up at this one. To his credit, he remained rapt throughout the entire two-hour-and-10-minute production. Although no one student blew me away, this was a strong year: favourites were Gerard Wilson's mono presentation of electric blue leather, chiffon and sequins (80s, but wearably so) and Kamalijit Thandi's delicately textured eau de nil and bronze dresses. Biggest laugh of the week came courtesy of James Doidge, whose menswear was far and away the most likely to do well - at least on the knowing streets of Trendy London. </p> <p>Too much menswear this week was made up exclusively of loose, baggy combat pants and heavily logo'd hoodies that relied on the smug hip-hop swagger of a bunch of \"rugged\" male models to pull it off. This \"urban\" uniform is well-established and well-liked among men, but it's so HUMOURLESS! Which is why Doidge's knitted alsatian jumper was such light relief. The green shellsuit festooned with hamsters might be a bit outr\u00e9 for your average man, but the denim jacket sewn with patches naming different dog breeds ... well, you could see Spike Jonze wearing it. </p> <p>Westminster had an excellent year: Jasmine Ghazilian showed a sophisticated collection featuring woven leather jackets in pearlised green, worn with flowing chiffon tops folded like origami. Sarah Patching mixed vintage lace with hand-embroidered digital prints and beading for a collection rich in textures and patterns. Rachael Scott's supple white leather miniskirts and asymmetric tops embroidered with silver thread were good, but the fact that she chose a thudding trance track to accompany her collection somehow made the clothes look cheaper, like eveningwear for disco dollies. Eirini Tigkaraki's gauzy eveningwear embroidered with red diamant\u00e9 stones looked promising. </p> <p>Also strong was Ravensbourne. Pusia Fleming sent out long felted wool skirts with punched-out holes in pastel pink, while Sarah Markham's long stripy dresses were childlike in their brightness. Both very commercial collections. </p> <p>Highlights from Nottingham Trent included Julia Dransfield (full maroon suede skirts, cowl-necked jumpers and chunky-knit scarves), Robert Whitehead (long dogtooth check skirts, fuchsia blouses, colourful ribbon trims) and Julie-Anne Crowfoot (40s-inspired daywear in Air Force and army colours). If Julie-Anne gets famous, will she change her surname? Some lucky students have names simply made to be strung in lights along the Place Vendme. Chloe Croft. Coralie Enthoven. Helen Sartoris. Signe Rose (I jest not). Sadly, most British names just don't have the romance of their Italian and French counterparts. </p> <p> The Surrey Institute are a pushy lot. Kathryn's mother excepted (we'll put that down to familial pride), it's the Surrey students who bombard people like me with CD-roms, website information and phone calls to check we're coming. If you're a journalist trying to get a front row seat so you can report on the shoes, you'll have to oust an angry parent first. Surrey also had by far the glossiest (and most helpful) brochure. Trust a Surrey student, then, to be the talk of London before the show had even commenced. In fact, two Surrey students battled it out for Next Big Thing: Amrik Chagger and Benjamin Shine (two more fine names, you'll agree). Chagger got some blokes to build an ice sculpture \"live\" on the catwalk, before showing hand-sewn pinstripe tailoring jazzed up with mad metallic accessories, including a solid \"silver\" jacket. Shine's ace-in-the-hole was work experience at Chloe - and the rumour that he'd achieved the highest pass-mark the college had ever given. Another rumour - \"He knows Ringo Starr\" - was perhaps less kind. </p> <p>Neither of these boys really did it for me: far more assured was Joseph Pollard's collection. His belted trenchcoats with their shiny woodgrain print, lemon-yellow panelled skirts and graphic tops were just the right side of quirky. Good luck, Joseph. Good luck to everyone. And farewell to Bhs, who have come to the end of their five-year commitment to sponsor Graduate Fashion Week. Their support has been appreciated. </p> <p><strong> Top 5 overused ideas</strong> </p> <p> 1 Nylon tights worn over shoes <br> 2 Origami techniques <br> 3 Moby's Porcelain <br> 4 Shiny-faced models <br> 5 Bloomers </p> <p><strong> Top 5 ripped-off designers</strong><br> </p> <p>1 Hussein Chalayan <br> 2 Dries Van Noten <br> 3 Rei Kawakubo <br> 4 Alexander McQueen <br> 5 Marni (new entry) </p> <p><strong> Top 5 attention-grabbers</strong></p> <p>1 An ice sculpture <br> 2 Clogs made of ice <br> 3 Using a \"famous\" model <br> 4 Male model smoking a \"joint\" <br> 5 A dog</p>",

The world-famous institution, based in London's swanky Kensington Gore, never shows in Graduate Fashion Week, instead staging its final year catwalk collection a week later.

Set up by Robin Darwin, the RCA's reforming rector, the course aimed to replace traditional dressmaking crafts with a syllabus that would ensure fashion design was accorded academic status. In what was a very bold move at the time, Darwin appointed Madge Garland, a former Vogue editor and fashion consultant to leading retailers, the UK's first Professor of Fashion. She had no knowledge of drawing, cutting or sewing, but what she lacked in basic skills she made up for in charisma and genuine passion for new design. \"Paris comes to Kensington!\" trumpeted the headlines. Her Vogue editorship had furnished her with a superlative list of contacts, which she shared avidly with her students. \"She took you under her wing,\" says Jane Brogden, a former pupil who became Professor of Fashion in 1971. \"She invited students to private cocktail parties because 'it would be good for you'.\" </p> <p>To this day, the fashion school prides itself on its close links with the industry, its bulging contacts book and its focus on directional teaching. Wendy Dagworthy is a kind of Madge Garland for the 21st century: she had her own successful design company for 16 years, defecting to the RCA after 10 years' teaching at rival Central St Martins. Dressed in a Marni felted jacket (pink), Prada Sport trainers (silver), Jonathan Aston fishnets (red) and a jaunty full skirt made by an ex-student, Dagworthy cuts a colourfully imposing (or imposingly colourful) figure. Her teaching philosophy is simple: to push students as far as their imaginations will take them, offering steady support all the way. \"We encourage them not to be afraid of making mistakes. You have to take risks to create something new.\" With 98% of graduates going straight into jobs, this philosophy is a sound one. </p> <p>Another course benefit is the special projects on offer: this year's graduates have worked with Daks, Benetton and Marks &amp; Spencer's Autograph to produce collections which may go into production. \"Working on their own collection as well as one for another company helps them get used to juggling their time,\" Dagworthy says. Students also get the benefit of working with a wider variety of fabrics. \"We did a project with Mila Schon, which was fantastic for the students because they got to use double cashmere at \u00a3250 a metre.\" </p> <p> Of course, for most students, an MA is not an option: however talented, your average student is left impoverished after a three-year BA course, particularly when fabric costs are added to already high living costs. Yet Dagworthy claims money is made available to those who need it: if the applicant is talented enough, they will find a way. Some get sponsored, others win bursaries (either from the college or from private companies) and there is always prize money to be won from external projects. </p> <p>Wandering round the college, you are struck by the amount of creativity on naked display. Students, dressed in clothes the rest of the world would find ridiculous, are pinning toiles on dummies, bending over patterns or debating the finer points of Lycra versus Tactel. The studios smell of hot steam, hard work and Golden Virginia. The big day is nigh, yet there are no clich\u00e9d fashion student hysterics; no evidence of sabotage or bitchery. Any stories of collections being burnt by jealous rivals? \"Well, now and again that does happen.\" Dagworthy laughs nervously. </p> <p>So which graduates are the ones to watch for 2000? Dagworthy is loath to highlight one at the expense of the others, but notes that footwear designer Marianne Britt J\u00f8rgensen has already appeared in Harpers &amp; Queen alongside Manolo Blahnik. The shoe maestro refers to her as \"the next me\". At next week's show, held in the college's Henry Moore Gallery, J\u00f8rgensen will parade her creations alongside the menswear, womenswear, knitwear and millinery students who make up the rest of the course. \"Expect lots of colour.

Call me old-fashioned, but as he stood there in his corduroy-collared poacher's-style jacket, denim-effect shirt and casual trousers, I saw someone ill-equipped to deal with the difficult times ahead. I saw someone whose appearance suggested he was not as meticulous, disciplined and upright as he might be. I saw someone in desperate need of a suit. </p> <p>Adults with lives will probably have clutched their heads in despair when they turned on Newsnight on Monday to see Kirsty Wark chairing a debate on the question of suit-wearing at work (dress-down Friday, smart casual - where will it end?). But the issue of suit-wearing is really rather an important one. The problem is that everyone has been approaching it as if it were nothing more than a question of sartorial choice: old buffers with rolled umbrellas versus hip young gunslingers with tanned bare feet in penny loafers. Call Me Tony claims that he's striking a blow for comfort and modernity but, of course, he thinks he's challenging a symbol of the \"forces of conservatism\" when, as it happens, there is nothing more divisive than chino rule. </p> <p>We already know that just days after Arthur Andersen initiated \"dress-down Friday\" in January they had to issue directives on how to do it because there was so much confusion and misery. </p> <p>Women know that - while it would be pushing it to describe it as a tyranny of modern life - there are few things more time-consuming than dressing appropriately for every occasion without formal guidelines. Uniforms, including the suit, are a great leveller, allowing chaps to look pretty much the same and get on with the business of proving that they are better than each other by other means. Suits are liberating. Why else did women get into them when they got into positions of power in the 80s, and (don't want to worry you here, but) why will they be back in them this autumn if designers have anything to do with it? Because flipsy-dipsy dress and flopsy-dopsy cardy get in the way of serious graft, whereas a rock-hard tailored suit is not just clothes to make money in, but armour, protecting you from exposure as the inexperienced, shit-scared not-one-of-them-at-all that you really are. And the same applies to men, in spades. </p> <p>Which brings me back to the more serious issues surrounding non-suit-wearing. Can you really trust a man who is got up in smart casual? Tony, though he won't come right out and say it, fancies himself down-dressing like his pal Clinton, or even Al Gore, pictured in this month's American Vogue looking suitably presidential in jeans and polo shirt. But who's to say that loose morals don't begin with loose clothes? Would Monica have found it quite so easy to deal with the fly buttons on a sturdy pair of bespoke flannel pinstripes? (\"Buttongate\" certainly doesn't have the same ring.) Would Clinton have seemed less attainable had he not been slopping about the Oval office in chinos looking at leisure and ready for pleasure rather than businesslike and upstanding, so to speak? </p> <p> I recently had my hand stitched up by a doctor sporting smart casual as opposed to buttoned-up white coat, and couldn't quite get out of my head the idea that he was doing a Paul McGann and just trying out medicine until he was caught. You don't want to have that feeling - nor with your bank manager, boss, dentist, train driver, pilot, or politicians. Or footballers for that matter. How much more confidence boosting was the sight of our boys heading off to Belgium in matching suits and blue ties than the Blair endorsed alternative - Becksy in bandana and capri pants, Shearer in fleece leisure suit and Seaman sporting Hawaiian print shirt and tight white trousers. They looked together, as in tidy and united. </p> <p>Likewise, I find that if I arrive at my desk wearing flip-flops, pyjama bottoms, bird's-nest hair and soup-stained vest (the prerogative of the freelance), it isn't long before I'm starting to act like Waynetta Slob, wondering if a kip in the corner by the dustbin would be out of the question and what the point of ashtrays is when you've got a perfectly good egg-covered plate to hand. Even if you don't go along with the slippery-slope theory, there's no reason to take the matter of appearance lightly.

There are those who use it as a mere series of suggestions - notional material on to which the writer can impose their own fictional reality. There is no reason at all why a writer could not publish a novel set during the period of, for example, the Great War of 1909 to 1915. Robert Harris's Fatherland created a parallel reality in which the Germans had won the second world war. We could, if we wished, write about a Britain ruled by King Becks and Queen Posh or an FA cup final in which Manchester United is beaten by Ipswich Town. Telling downright lies isn't the problem: it is telling the truth that gets you into trouble. If you make John F Kennedy a walk-on character in your fiction, do you invent dialogue for him that he never said, or do you use his own written and spoken words, which may be denied you by copyright laws that are intended to protect intellectual property?

I had spent some years knowing members of the Communist party in the US who had survived the worst of the McCarthy period and its purges. Watching eastern Europe fall apart - Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia - I thought of those who invested their lives in the dream of socialism and who now saw that dream totally overthrown. What did I feel for them? Compassion. The same compassion I feel for the early socialist Zionists who genuinely believed, without the benefit of hindsight, that they were building a Jewish utopia on the shores of the Mediterranean and who could not foresee the society they wound up with, ravaged by war and religious intolerance. </p> <p>To write novels like these, one cannot invent history. History is the point. My greatest fear when I was writing When I Lived in Modern Times was that a reviewer would say: \"Linda Grant makes a great many mistakes about the period. It wasn't like that.\" What was it like, then? To find out one must consult something other than one's own imagination. Writing about the era of McCarthyite America, I read The Romance of American Communism by Vivian Gornick, a landmark work of oral history in which the author interviewed those whose lives had been given to the party - and some who had been destroyed by it - and the terrible times they lived through. I was deeply impressed by the words of a woman who spoke under the name \"Diana Michaels\", now a lawyer, who said: \"I know I was vain, silly, mad for sexual success, but I was a communist and being a communist made me better than I was. It could all have been so much worse.\" </p> <p>Diana Michaels became Sybil Ross, the narrator of The Cast Iron Shore. I did not use her history - Sybil's was entirely different - but without reading those words of \"Diana Michaels\" there could have been no Sybil. And without Gornick's painstaking research, there would have been a much poorer understanding of the mindset of those who stayed inside the party during its worst years. </p> <p>Many of my characters are imbued with something from Gornick's penetrating insights, but they are not the self-same people that she spoke to, thinly disguised under new names with tiny details tweaked. They are transformed because that's what fiction is, transformative. </p> <p>Who owns history? In When I Lived in Modern Times, some facts no one seems actually to possess - such as the date of the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. I had to look it up and to do so referred to a book: AJ Sherman's Mandate Days, a marvellous account of the period told through the letters and diaries of mandate officials. In it I found other dates - of riots by British troops, of the arrest of the Irgun member Dov Gruner, who would be later hanged by the British in Acre prison. It was important to me to get these facts right. Because I am a journalist I am by training a checker of facts and a citer of sources. It comes as second nature to me. But novels can't footnote or credit in the text. The only way they can do so is through acknowledgements. There is always a tendency towards vanity, wanting to fool the reader into thinking this is all your own work. But I believe this is a mistake. </p> <p>In my original manuscript my sources were acknowledged. My publishers thought this was unnecessary and I spoke subsequently to another celebrated novelist who was similarly persuaded to omit his own acknowledgements section. Like him I accepted the decision. </p> <p>After Sherman's letter to me asking for his work to be acknowledged, I insisted that the section was restored. It has been in the paperback edition for several weeks and includes the names of the other works I used. </p> <p>However, contrary to any assertions, it was not Sherman's words that appear in my book but those of the writers of the letters and diaries, collected in a public archive at Oxford university, which he himself quotes. This is called primary material. And the use of primary sources create its own difficulties. </p> <p>Reading these letters and diaries I was forcibly struck by the way people talked in those days. I wanted to capture that rather clipped, British way of speaking (a woman dismissing Palestine as \"rather too bare for my taste, not a patch on Portugal\") and how incongruous it seemed compared to the way the Jews spoke. In Tel Aviv I had spent many hours listening to a woman called Lotte Geiger who came to Berlin in May 1933 after seeing one of the first attacks on a Jewish shop in the city. Sixty-five years after leaving Germany, her speech was as influenced by her upbringing now as it had been then. I badly wanted to capture the turns of phrase people used in those days, the casually anti-semitic remarks as well as the sense of colonial duty. This is what people really said and felt, and whatever else might be amiss, you cannot contend that I am imposing on the past my own agenda. </p> <p>But if you create, as I did, a fictional character called Inspector Bolton, a pock-marked man in a belted mac, a racist and anti-semite with an equally unpleasant wife, and if you give to him a few of the words written in a diary or a letter by someone whose physical appearance and views are unknown to you, might they feel that they have been libelled by this fictional portrayal? </p> <p>Rows of this kind seem to have dogged writers for years and, curiously, they usually seem to surface around the time of literary prizes. I don't think that they do a great deal to serve the real debates that we need to have about the portrayal of fact in fiction, rather they are literary \"scandals\" that flare up and die down and are usually forgotten. Ironically, having been the centre of such a row, I have found myself going from being the surprise outsider in the Orange Prize to the subject of a Times editorial. </p> <p>What gets lost in these rows are the books themselves, and the real and difficult question of how writers such as myself, Pat Barker, Louis de Berni\u00e8res and Ronan Bennett write about history, and whether we need to do so differently than Dickens or Balzac. For when novelists wish to be in partnership with history, it will always be a stormy relationship.</p>",

But if you create, as I did, a fictional character called Inspector Bolton, a pock-marked man in a belted mac, a racist and anti-semite with an equally unpleasant wife, and if you give to him a few of the words written in a diary or a letter by someone whose physical appearance and views are unknown to you, might they feel that they have been libelled by this fictional portrayal? Rows of this kind seem to have dogged writers for years and, curiously, they usually seem to surface around the time of literary prizes. I don't think that they do a great deal to serve the real debates that we need to have about the portrayal of fact in fiction, rather they are literary \"scandals\" that flare up and die down and are usually forgotten. Ironically, having been the centre of such a row, I have found myself going from being the surprise outsider in the Orange Prize to the subject of a Times editorial. What gets lost in these rows are the books themselves, and the real and difficult question of how writers such as myself, Pat Barker, Louis de Berni\u00e8res and Ronan Bennett write about history, and whether we need to do so differently than Dickens or Balzac. For when novelists wish to be in partnership with history, it will always be a stormy relationship.",

First, the OECD is an independent organisation. It doesn't have a political interest in persuading Britain either to join the euro or to stay out, so its comments will have a significant impact. Secondly, the greater the similarities between the British economy and the rest of Europe, the easier it should be for Britain to replace the pound with the euro without economic disruption. British opponents of the euro have long argued that membership would be a mistake because the British and European economies run differently - meaning that what might be good for Germany would not be good for Britain. This report makes that case look weaker.</p> <p><b>The Treasury must be happy?</b><br> Not exactly. While flattered to be praised by the OECD for Britain's 'rather enviable' economic performance, the Treasury is worried that reports such as this will bring the issue of joining the euro to the top of the political agenda. Ministers would rather leave the question until after the general election. They worry that the Conservatives will be able to turn the election into a contest about euro membership - and every opinion poll shows that at the moment the public do not want to join. In fact the <a href=\" http://www.treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Treasury</a> is so worried about this that it apparently persuaded the OECD to tone down those remarks suggesting that Britain was ready to join the single currency. </p> <p><b>So what do we have to do to join?</b><br> The British have to meet two conditions - known as the 'convergence criteria'. The first, the 'Maastricht criteria', were put in place by the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, which led to the single currency. These require that any country wanting to join the euro passes a set of tests on its economic performance, in areas such as debt, inflation, interest rates and borrowing. Britain meets these with flying colours, so according to the rules we could join the euro tomorrow if we wanted to. But in October 1997 the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced five further tests he wants the British economy to pass before it joins. These mostly cover the impact of the euro on Britain's international competitiveness, but the most important of them requires Britain and Europe's economic cycles to be parallel, so that European interest rates do not cause economic harm when they are imposed on this side of the channel.</p> <p><b>Do we meet Gordon Brown's tests?</b><br> Not quite. The new OECD report says Britain is close to doing so (although it also doubts the value of Brown's tests) but the recent low value of the euro against the pound means that few economists think Britain could safely join at the moment. There are signs, though, that the euro is beginning to rise in value, which would make this less of a problem. </p> <p><b>So we will join?</b><br> Ah. At this point, economics matter less than politics. It looks as if Britain will meet every possible criteria for joining the single currency soon after the next election - but if the prime minister thinks the public don't want to go in, he may still shy away from holding the referendum he has promised on the issue. And even if the referendum does take place, there's no guarantee that it will be won by those who think we should join.

      "body": "<p>The French detective writer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dard, who has died of a heart attack aged 78, was a prolific novelist, whose work was compared to that of Georges Simenon and who was acclaimed as a \"magician\" with language. The French president, Jacques Chirac, described him as \"an immensely generous writer\".</p> <p>He produced over 300 books, more than half of them based around the partnership of two police officers, Superintendent San Antonio and his sidekick Inspector Berurier. Known as the \"San Antonio\" books - Dard reportedly chose his hero's name by simply going through lists of cities on a map of the United States - they had sold a phenomenal 27m copies by the time of the author's death.</p> <p>Dard was born in Bourgoin-Jallieu, in the Is\u00e8re region of France, the son of an artisan, turned businessman. He was brought up by his grandmother while his parents were busy with their central heating company. It was his grandmother, he said later, who first gave him a love of literature by encouraging him to read. Of all his childhood memories, his most vivid was the sight of the family possessions being seized when his father's business collapsed into bankruptcy in the 1930s. The family were forced to move to Lyon, where the best future for the young Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric seemed to be working as a clerk.</p> <p>Instead, his uncle, who worked in a garage, managed to put him in touch with a local magazine, Le Mois de Lyon. Here, as a young journalist writing about Lyon's city street life, Dard discovered a new world of brothels, pimps and criminals - and the work of \"les flics\", the police.</p> <p>Dard published his first novel in 1940, at the age of only 19. Several books later, he was encouraged by Georges Simenon to try and adapt one of them for the theatre. In 1950, convinced that this was where his future lay, Dard moved to Paris with his wife Odette, whom he had married in 1942, and their two children.</p> <p>But the theatre was not the immediate answer to his problems. As a struggling writer trying to support a young family, Dard needed money, and, in desperation, went back to writing novels. He needed to have quick success, and was influenced by the American thriller writer Peter Cheyney, who had produced a string of popular pulp-fiction books in the 1940s.</p> <p>Dard was encouraged by Armand de Caro, a new young publisher he had met, and, with his main detective character San Antonio - himself a criminal by nature - already formed in his mind, he looked back to his childhood to find his hero's assistant. Inspector Berurier was based on a neighbour haunted by the first world war.</p> <p>Dard worked at an extraordinary rate, producing up to five novels a year - while still holding on to the possibilities of cinema and television productions. But, as he became more famous, he found the pressures building up. He was constantly being interviewed, and despite their new-found wealth, he and Odette experienced marital difficulties. In 1965, Dard attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself. He and Odette finally split up, and in 1969 he married de Caro's daughter Fran\u00e7oise.</p> <p>By the 1960s, the academic world had become particularly infatuated by Dard's use of language.

      "bodyText": "The French detective writer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dard, who has died of a heart attack aged 78, was a prolific novelist, whose work was compared to that of Georges Simenon and who was acclaimed as a \"magician\" with language. The French president, Jacques Chirac, described him as \"an immensely generous writer\". He produced over 300 books, more than half of them based around the partnership of two police officers, Superintendent San Antonio and his sidekick Inspector Berurier. Known as the \"San Antonio\" books - Dard reportedly chose his hero's name by simply going through lists of cities on a map of the United States - they had sold a phenomenal 27m copies by the time of the author's death. Dard was born in Bourgoin-Jallieu, in the Is\u00e8re region of France, the son of an artisan, turned businessman. He was brought up by his grandmother while his parents were busy with their central heating company. It was his grandmother, he said later, who first gave him a love of literature by encouraging him to read. Of all his childhood memories, his most vivid was the sight of the family possessions being seized when his father's business collapsed into bankruptcy in the 1930s. The family were forced to move to Lyon, where the best future for the young Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric seemed to be working as a clerk. Instead, his uncle, who worked in a garage, managed to put him in touch with a local magazine, Le Mois de Lyon. Here, as a young journalist writing about Lyon's city street life, Dard discovered a new world of brothels, pimps and criminals - and the work of \"les flics\", the police. Dard published his first novel in 1940, at the age of only 19. Several books later, he was encouraged by Georges Simenon to try and adapt one of them for the theatre. In 1950, convinced that this was where his future lay, Dard moved to Paris with his wife Odette, whom he had married in 1942, and their two children. But the theatre was not the immediate answer to his problems. As a struggling writer trying to support a young family, Dard needed money, and, in desperation, went back to writing novels. He needed to have quick success, and was influenced by the American thriller writer Peter Cheyney, who had produced a string of popular pulp-fiction books in the 1940s. Dard was encouraged by Armand de Caro, a new young publisher he had met, and, with his main detective character San Antonio - himself a criminal by nature - already formed in his mind, he looked back to his childhood to find his hero's assistant. Inspector Berurier was based on a neighbour haunted by the first world war. Dard worked at an extraordinary rate, producing up to five novels a year - while still holding on to the possibilities of cinema and television productions. But, as he became more famous, he found the pressures building up. He was constantly being interviewed, and despite their new-found wealth, he and Odette experienced marital difficulties. In 1965, Dard attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself. He and Odette finally split up, and in 1969 he married de Caro's daughter Fran\u00e7oise. By the 1960s, the academic world had become particularly infatuated by Dard's use of language. Whole seminars were given over to the San Antonio books, and the way that Dard combined words; for \"sleet\", which consists of \"rain-pluie\" and \"snow-neige\", he would write of the weather, \"il pleige\"; on other occasions, he would invent entirely new Franch words, such as \"adulttre\". It is little wonder that there were those who thought he should be elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. But Dard was not impressed, just as he remained unaffected by the admiration of French politicians, including the then president of France, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Outside the detective genre, Dard wrote many novels using a pseudonym. These ranged from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charles to Kaput and L'Ange Noir (The Black Angel). In 1983, Josephine, his daughter with Fran\u00e7oise, was kidnapped while the family were living in Switzerland. Although, after her release, the novelist said it was the most traumatic moment of his life, he later used the idea of the kidnapping in one of his books. He would also often invent imaginary moments in French history and, although he said he feared death, his one regret was that he would not be able to use it in one of his own books. Dard is survived by his second wife, Fran\u00e7oise, and three children, two of them from his marriage to Odette.

      "body": "<p>Oh dear: 395,000 farmed salmon have fled their cages and swum off into the far blue yonder in the first five months of this year, according to a report this week. Well, there's a surprise. </p> <p>Or perhaps not. Apparently another 225,000 of the slippery bleeders got away last year. It seems that they have been at it for years, mingling with their wild cousins, probably interbreeding with them, with untold consequences for the genetic make-up of the fish - including the incredible inbuilt code that tells them how to come back, year after year, to the same rivers to breed. And then there's the possibility that the farmed salmon, once in the wild, are spreading the diseases to which they are notoriously prone. </p> <p>The report is another blow to the embattled Scottish salmon farming industry, which in recent years has had to cope with infectious salmon anaemia, accusations of habitual overuse of chemicals and general environmental mayhem. Not to mention the fact that international prices are being kept uneconomically low by the vast state-supported and less tightly controlled Norwegian industry, which dumps huge quantities of farmed fish on the open market. </p> <p>The downward forces on the price of salmon has made it the cod de nos jours . In fact, as stocks of the free-swimming cod have crashed, pushing the price higher and higher, it is now enjoying a kind of celebrity and fashionableness that only relative rarity and expense can bring. </p> <p>Salmon, on the other hand, is now cheap and ubiquitous. In 1998 the Scottish industry produced 86,000 tonnes of the stuff. This may be dwarfed by the tonnage that the Norwegians churn out, but it's still a lot of fish flesh.

You feed the salmon a mix of fish-meal protein, fish oil, vitamins and minerals to produce quick growth, as well as pigment to achieve the desirable pink colour.

You can always tell the uncooked flesh by its floppy, flabby condition and the distinctive, regular layers of creamy white fat between the pink sections of flesh, which together create a kind of herringbone effect.

Indeed, in spite of its popularity in the catering trade, few top chefs will touch intensively farmed fish. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the wild salmon is in very serious trouble too. Stocks of salmon have been in decline for several decades, but so bad have the spawning runs up rivers become in recent years - particularly in spring - that fishermen in England have been forbidden to kill any salmon before June 15, and many of the prime Scottish rivers have set limits of one fish per rod per week.

      "bodyText": "Oh dear: 395,000 farmed salmon have fled their cages and swum off into the far blue yonder in the first five months of this year, according to a report this week. Well, there's a surprise. Or perhaps not. Apparently another 225,000 of the slippery bleeders got away last year. It seems that they have been at it for years, mingling with their wild cousins, probably interbreeding with them, with untold consequences for the genetic make-up of the fish - including the incredible inbuilt code that tells them how to come back, year after year, to the same rivers to breed. And then there's the possibility that the farmed salmon, once in the wild, are spreading the diseases to which they are notoriously prone. The report is another blow to the embattled Scottish salmon farming industry, which in recent years has had to cope with infectious salmon anaemia, accusations of habitual overuse of chemicals and general environmental mayhem. Not to mention the fact that international prices are being kept uneconomically low by the vast state-supported and less tightly controlled Norwegian industry, which dumps huge quantities of farmed fish on the open market. The downward forces on the price of salmon has made it the cod de nos jours . In fact, as stocks of the free-swimming cod have crashed, pushing the price higher and higher, it is now enjoying a kind of celebrity and fashionableness that only relative rarity and expense can bring. Salmon, on the other hand, is now cheap and ubiquitous. In 1998 the Scottish industry produced 86,000 tonnes of the stuff. This may be dwarfed by the tonnage that the Norwegians churn out, but it's still a lot of fish flesh. Small wonder that super market chiller cabinets are stacked with neatly trimmed bricks of salmon fillets. It lends itself to the array of ready-prepared cook-chill lines.

In that way England retain some of Shearer's power up front (not the sort of power Freddie Ljungberg was talking about, by the way) as well as somebody who can hold the ball up. The only problem being that while Heskey could play in Shearer's position, he quite patently doesn't at the moment.</p> <p>Robbie Fowler is \"still not match fit\", but also hasn't had a good game at senior level since September.

But if the Euro was Kevin Keegan (which it could be, it hasn't checked), it would pack the midfield with the creative trio of Scholes, Barmby and McManaman and let Owen play by himself up front.</p> <p>The irony of the whole situation is, of course, that because Shearer played in all of the recent friendlies, none of the other strikers have had much of a run out together.

I am glad that the OECD confirms that view.\"</p> <p>The report complimented the government for its economic reforms, calling the outlook for growth and inflation \"rather enviable\". But it urged ministers to make sure the much-needed extra cash being poured into the health service as part of the new spending review was well spent and said one of the major challenges ahead was what to do about euro membership.</p> <p>The OECD's view is that the UK passes the Maastricht criteria on debt, inflation, interest rates and borrowing levels with flying colours and is well on its way to fulfilling the chancellor's five tests, even though it doubts their objectivity.</p> <p>With the two business cycles coming into line, interest rates getting closer and structural reform in the euro area gathering pace, it said: \"In sum, on several scores, even as an 'out', the United Kingdom is projected to be as close, or even closer, to the economic centre of gravity of the euro area than some of the current 'ins'.\" The gap between UK and Euroland interest rates narrowed further yesterday when the European Central Bank raised borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.25%. UK interest rates are 6%.</p> <p>The OECD added that the pound/euro exchange rate remained a problem, although some City economists say that the recent fall of sterling shows that the markets are beginning to take a more realistic view of the pound's value. The euro rallied to a seven-month high against the pound yesterday, bolstered by the shrinking interest rate gap.</p> <p>Britain in Europe, the pro-European lobby group, welcomed the OECD report, saying it showed \"that those people who say Britain will never be able to join the single currency have got their facts wrong. As the high pound does increasing damage to manufacturing industry and inward investment, it is becoming clear that exclusion from the single currency is not a cost-free option.\"</p> <p>But Janet Bush, director of New Europe, the anti-monetary union thinktank, said: \"The OECD offers a highly selective and glib view of economic convergence between Britain and Euroland, basing its analysis on a handful of economic indicators that may well prove to be ships passing in the night. It offers no evidence of the 'sustainable and durable convergence' that the chancellor of the exchequer has declared essential.\"</p> <p>Condemning the chancellor's five tests as a sham, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo, said: \"The government is already committed in principle to join the euro. They are now waiting for a convenient time to hold a referendum.</p> <p>\"This government is committed to following the politics of expediency not the politics of principle, so when they think they can con the electorate into voting to scrap the pound they will.\"</p>",

I am glad that the OECD confirms that view.\" The report complimented the government for its economic reforms, calling the outlook for growth and inflation \"rather enviable\". But it urged ministers to make sure the much-needed extra cash being poured into the health service as part of the new spending review was well spent and said one of the major challenges ahead was what to do about euro membership. The OECD's view is that the UK passes the Maastricht criteria on debt, inflation, interest rates and borrowing levels with flying colours and is well on its way to fulfilling the chancellor's five tests, even though it doubts their objectivity. With the two business cycles coming into line, interest rates getting closer and structural reform in the euro area gathering pace, it said: \"In sum, on several scores, even as an 'out', the United Kingdom is projected to be as close, or even closer, to the economic centre of gravity of the euro area than some of the current 'ins'.\" The gap between UK and Euroland interest rates narrowed further yesterday when the European Central Bank raised borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.25%. UK interest rates are 6%. The OECD added that the pound/euro exchange rate remained a problem, although some City economists say that the recent fall of sterling shows that the markets are beginning to take a more realistic view of the pound's value. The euro rallied to a seven-month high against the pound yesterday, bolstered by the shrinking interest rate gap. Britain in Europe, the pro-European lobby group, welcomed the OECD report, saying it showed \"that those people who say Britain will never be able to join the single currency have got their facts wrong. As the high pound does increasing damage to manufacturing industry and inward investment, it is becoming clear that exclusion from the single currency is not a cost-free option.\" But Janet Bush, director of New Europe, the anti-monetary union thinktank, said: \"The OECD offers a highly selective and glib view of economic convergence between Britain and Euroland, basing its analysis on a handful of economic indicators that may well prove to be ships passing in the night. It offers no evidence of the 'sustainable and durable convergence' that the chancellor of the exchequer has declared essential.\" Condemning the chancellor's five tests as a sham, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo, said: \"The government is already committed in principle to join the euro. They are now waiting for a convenient time to hold a referendum. \"This government is committed to following the politics of expediency not the politics of principle, so when they think they can con the electorate into voting to scrap the pound they will.\"",

Chatting at candle-lit tables in an ambience of understated Scandinavian chic, the well-heeled guests have paid 150 krone (\u00a313) each to hear the government's case for joining the single currency. Henrik Dam Kristensen, the most popular minister in the centrist coalition, has arrived from Copenhagen to deliver the carefully honed speech he will repeat many times before the referendum on September 28.

Though his early career was conventional, he later took on a variety of exotic missions - including training foreign armies abroad. In the early 1990s, he was on loan to the Zimbabwe national army (ZNA) which involved visits to Mozambique where the ZNA was helping government forces in the civil war with Renamo guerrillas. His commanding officer at the time praised him for his \"tact, firmness and professionalism\". He added: \"[Saunders] is endlessly patient and his sense of humour allows him to make his point firmly but in an acceptable manner\". Immediately before that, he was in Hong Kong, engaged in capturing illegal immigrants along the border with China as well as helping the government cope with refugees from Vietnam. Brig Saunders was a military attache in Canberra and defence adviser in Papua New Guinea from 1993-96 at a time when British companies were providing the army with weapons. The next year, he was appointed military assistant to the commander of the Iraq-Kuwait observer mission, where, as the Ministry of Defence put it yesterday, he \"travelled throughout Iraq and frequently visited Baghdad for discussions with Saddam Hussein's regime\". Brig Saunders, 52, was commissioned into the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment in 1967 and served with his battalion in Berlin, Cyprus, Northern Ireland and Germany. In 1993, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. As an undergraduate on army scholarship at Bristol university, where he studied geography and economics, he took part in one of the society's sponsored expeditions to the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan. He was promoted to brigadier last year when he was appointed defence attache to Greece. He leaves a wife, Heather, and two daughters, Nicola 15, and Catherine, 14.",

He died about three hours later in hospital. Bullet cartridges found at the scene showed that it was the work of November 17, an urban guerrilla group that has acted with impunity since 1975. It emerged last night that the Foreign Office had conducted a security review of British embassy staff in Athens in March. Brig Saunder's car had normal Greek licence plates and no diplomatic insignia - a safety precaution taken by most Western embassies in Athens, police said. Greece's Nato allies are fast losing patience with its failure to arrest members of November 17. Athens police yesterday launched a manhunt, setting up roadblocks all over the capital and sending out scores of plainclothes officers to search for the attackers. But its response failed to quell criticism of the authorities' sluggish approach to November 17, none of whose members has been apprehended. \"The Greeks have got to get their act together,\" a Foreign Office source said last night, adding that four officers from the anti-terrorist branch would work with the Greek police. \"This highlights again that Greece needs to take a tougher stance against terrorism,\" said US Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon. A contrite Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, telephoned Tony Blair and expressed his horror at the assassination. \"The Greek government will do its duty and defend with all means _ citizens' safety,\" Mr Simitis said in a statement. The killing comes only three days after a US congressional commission on terrorism alleged that Greece was \"the weakest link\" in European counter-terrorism efforts. The report urged that Greece, along with Pakistan, should be categorised as nations which were not cooperating fully with anti-terrorist efforts and said Greeks should no longer qualify for the US visa waiver programme under which most European Union nationals now travel to the US. The US report caused outrage in the Greek press and was officially condemned by the Greek ambassador to Washington as \"unacceptable\" and by a government spokes- man in Athens as bearing \"no relation to reality\". Yesterday, Greek foreign minister George Papandreou promised a \"most merciless\" response against suspected terrorists. \"We will not let the international image of our country be plagued,\" he said. In the past 25 years, there have been 146 attacks on American targets in Greece, an average of one every two months. Four US officials have died in that time. Of the 146 attacks, only one has been solved. Britain's defence minister, Baroness Symons, who is in Athens on an official visit, said Brig Saunders was \"an enormously valued member of the ambassador's staff. It is a tragedy that such a good man has had his life cut short.\" Mr Blair told a cabinet meeting in London that Brig Saunders' death was \"an act of terrorism. It was as contemptible as it was senseless, and will be condemned by all right minded people.\"",

      "body": "<p>The main character may be into cross-dressing, but the producers of Big Momma's House are more interested in cross-over - that is to say, will the predominantly white American cinema audience take to Martin Lawrence's new film about a black FBI man? </p> <p>The answer from the box office after the film opened last weekend would appear to be a resounding yes. A comedy about an FBI agent who goes undercover disguised as a large southern granny defied lukewarm reviews and took $26m at the box office over the weekend, only just behind Mission: Impossible 2, despite the fact that it was playing in 800 fewer cinemas. Dinosaur, Shanghai Noon and Gladiator made up the top five. </p> <p>Comedic cross-dressing has worked happily from Some Like it Hot to Tootsie to Mrs Doubtfire, but the acceptability of black actors in comedies to white audiences and vice versa does not have quite such an established history.</p> <p>The top television show for black viewers in the US, for instance, is The Parkers, a comedy about a black mother and daughter going to the same college. It features nowhere amongst white audiences. Equally, Friends and Frasier do not make it into the top 10 shows among black viewers, despite being huge hits with white audiences.</p> <p>Eddie Murphy has long since crossed the gulf but Lawrence has a more varied CV, including brushes with the law, and until the last weekend it was not clear how far his new vehicle, driven by director Raja Gosnell, would travel. The fact that Lawrence performs in a fat suit just like Eddie Murphy's in The Nutty Professor will not bother any of the film's backers. </p> <p>By chance, The Measure of a Man, Sidney Poitier's second volume of autobiography, finds itself in the best-selling book charts just as Martin Lawrence finds his movie in the best-selling film charts. When Poitier started acting in the 50s, a black person was not allowed to embrace a white person on screen, and it was only in 1957 that the Motion Picture Code was changed to permit this.</p> <p>Many of the parts then available to a black actor were as a servant or a buffoon and Poitier reveals that he turned down a chance to act in the film version of Porgy and Bess because he felt it was insulting to black people. In The Defiant Ones, Poitier and Tony Curtis played escaped convicts chained together and Poitier's character gives up his chance of freedom to help the injured Curtis. When the film was first shown, Harlem audiences shouted at the screen and told Poitier to get back on that train. </p> <p>Black people were shouting at the screen during Big Momma's House last week-end but it was with laughter as Lawrence slipped into something uncomfortable and spent most of the film in drag. So Lawrence, who was discovered on Star Search as a stand-up comic in 1987, could have a bigger hit on his hands than any of his previous films such as Blue Streak, Life or House Party. </p> <p>\"Racism is obviously a factor in Hollywood,\" said Denzel Washington at the Guardian interview at the National Film Theatre in March. \"Where I think the most work needs to be done is behind the camera. That said, it's very difficult for women of any colour in Hollywood. The men get older and the women get younger and I think the bottom of the totem pole is African-American women or women of colour. They get the fewest opportunities.\" </p> <p>Well, two of them get big opportunities in Big Momma's House. Nia Long, named one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful people (whatever that means), is Sherry, the love interest, and Ella Mitchell got to play the real Big Momma and to attend last week's opening bash at the House of Blues in Hollywood along with the black entertainment aristocracy of Will Smith, Magic Johnson, Carl Lewis, Laila Ali and Jermaine Jackson. </p> <p>One genuinely exclusive piece of information I can pass on about the film: the sound of breaking wind is made by a greenish goo contained in a plastic carton, manufactured in Switzerland and, for those people who never quite outgrew the whoopee cushion, available in toy shops under the name of Wind Breaker. Rib-tickling fun is to be had using it in cinemas during dramatic or romantic moments.</p> <p>Crossovers of a different kind seem to be happening on the stage. Following the translation of The Graduate from film to theatre, comes the musical stage version of The Full Monty which opened at the Old Globe theatre (not to be confused with the upstart new Globe theatre in England) in San Diego last weekend and is now thought likely to make it to Broadway. </p> <p>As is now the way of everything from Colditz onwards, the gallant British heroes from Sheffield have been transmogrified into Americans from Buffalo, New York. The Gaz character, played by Robert Carlyle in the film, has been turned by playwright Terrence McNally into a bit of a homophobe who realises the error of his ways.

      "bodyText": "The main character may be into cross-dressing, but the producers of Big Momma's House are more interested in cross-over - that is to say, will the predominantly white American cinema audience take to Martin Lawrence's new film about a black FBI man? The answer from the box office after the film opened last weekend would appear to be a resounding yes. A comedy about an FBI agent who goes undercover disguised as a large southern granny defied lukewarm reviews and took $26m at the box office over the weekend, only just behind Mission: Impossible 2, despite the fact that it was playing in 800 fewer cinemas. Dinosaur, Shanghai Noon and Gladiator made up the top five. Comedic cross-dressing has worked happily from Some Like it Hot to Tootsie to Mrs Doubtfire, but the acceptability of black actors in comedies to white audiences and vice versa does not have quite such an established history. The top television show for black viewers in the US, for instance, is The Parkers, a comedy about a black mother and daughter going to the same college. It features nowhere amongst white audiences. Equally, Friends and Frasier do not make it into the top 10 shows among black viewers, despite being huge hits with white audiences. Eddie Murphy has long since crossed the gulf but Lawrence has a more varied CV, including brushes with the law, and until the last weekend it was not clear how far his new vehicle, driven by director Raja Gosnell, would travel. The fact that Lawrence performs in a fat suit just like Eddie Murphy's in The Nutty Professor will not bother any of the film's backers. By chance, The Measure of a Man, Sidney Poitier's second volume of autobiography, finds itself in the best-selling book charts just as Martin Lawrence finds his movie in the best-selling film charts. When Poitier started acting in the 50s, a black person was not allowed to embrace a white person on screen, and it was only in 1957 that the Motion Picture Code was changed to permit this. Many of the parts then available to a black actor were as a servant or a buffoon and Poitier reveals that he turned down a chance to act in the film version of Porgy and Bess because he felt it was insulting to black people. In The Defiant Ones, Poitier and Tony Curtis played escaped convicts chained together and Poitier's character gives up his chance of freedom to help the injured Curtis. When the film was first shown, Harlem audiences shouted at the screen and told Poitier to get back on that train. Black people were shouting at the screen during Big Momma's House last week-end but it was with laughter as Lawrence slipped into something uncomfortable and spent most of the film in drag. So Lawrence, who was discovered on Star Search as a stand-up comic in 1987, could have a bigger hit on his hands than any of his previous films such as Blue Streak, Life or House Party. \"Racism is obviously a factor in Hollywood,\" said Denzel Washington at the Guardian interview at the National Film Theatre in March. \"Where I think the most work needs to be done is behind the camera. That said, it's very difficult for women of any colour in Hollywood. The men get older and the women get younger and I think the bottom of the totem pole is African-American women or women of colour. They get the fewest opportunities.\" Well, two of them get big opportunities in Big Momma's House. Nia Long, named one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful people (whatever that means), is Sherry, the love interest, and Ella Mitchell got to play the real Big Momma and to attend last week's opening bash at the House of Blues in Hollywood along with the black entertainment aristocracy of Will Smith, Magic Johnson, Carl Lewis, Laila Ali and Jermaine Jackson. One genuinely exclusive piece of information I can pass on about the film: the sound of breaking wind is made by a greenish goo contained in a plastic carton, manufactured in Switzerland and, for those people who never quite outgrew the whoopee cushion, available in toy shops under the name of Wind Breaker. Rib-tickling fun is to be had using it in cinemas during dramatic or romantic moments. Crossovers of a different kind seem to be happening on the stage. Following the translation of The Graduate from film to theatre, comes the musical stage version of The Full Monty which opened at the Old Globe theatre (not to be confused with the upstart new Globe theatre in England) in San Diego last weekend and is now thought likely to make it to Broadway. As is now the way of everything from Colditz onwards, the gallant British heroes from Sheffield have been transmogrified into Americans from Buffalo, New York. The Gaz character, played by Robert Carlyle in the film, has been turned by playwright Terrence McNally into a bit of a homophobe who realises the error of his ways. That's the way they do it in LA.",

Whether consciously or not, the moment echoes the introductory scene from Woody Allen's 1984 comedy Broadway Danny Rose. Sure, one features a bunch of Borscht Belt Jewish comics and the other a crop of suited and booted criminals, but in tone, mood and sheer fly-on-the-wall authenticity, the scenes are cut from the same cloth, and cut - more importantly - by a tailor who knows what he's doing.</p> <p>It's this very authenticity that marks Gangster No. 1 out from the crowd. Directed by Paul McGuigan, this is a very different breed of modern gangster picture: serious where the likes of Love, Honour and Obey and Rancid Aluminium opted for self-conscious gags, realistic where Lock, Stock was the stuff of lads' mags fantasies. Duff ending aside, it's a film that walks it like it talks it. All the little details ring true.</p> <p>Credit for much of this must go to Bruce Reynolds, who served as a 'special consultant' on the project. Reynolds, a thief by trade, was the mastermind behind the Great Train Robbery of 1963 (for which he subsequently served 10 years of a 25-year sentence), and is a man intimately acquainted with the 1960s underworld that the film details. \"Bruce's input was invaluable,\" says McGuigan. \"His inside knowledge and sense of authenticity was a big help. He also worked with us on the language of the piece.\"</p> <p>Reynolds is no stranger to the film world: he worked in a similar capacity on 1998's Great Train Robbery picture Buster. He is currently teaming up with his former partner in crime Ronnie Biggs to help develop a Great Train Robbery computer game. Even on the straight and narrow, crime still pays for 68-year-old Reynolds. He's one of a select band of former criminals ('Mad' Frankie Fraser and Dave Courtney in recent times, George Raft in days gone by) who have parleyed their former notoriety into a lucrative sideline in the entertainment industry. From con to consultant in one fell swoop.</p> <p>Reynolds, not surprisingly, feels that this can only be a healthy development. \"We're freeing ourselves from all that Victorian hypocrisy,\" he points out, smoking Silk Cut in a comfortable London office. \"We're basically saying: 'these are the people who did these things.

The man who enters the room is bespectacled, refined, delicately built - a white-haired Buster Keaton with a sarf London accent. He critiques Gangster No.1 like an Oxbridge intellectual (the direction, he says, is \"very Nic Roeg-ish\"), remarks that one of his favourite film-makers is Robert Bresson, and relates how he once enraged inmates while working in the prison library by screening Monte Hellman's radical art-house classic Two Lane Blacktop at his weekly film show. It's no surprise that on leaving school the man had his heart set on becoming a foreign correspondent and worked for several years (first as a messenger boy, then in the accounts department) at the Daily Mail.</p> <p>But then Reynolds sits slightly at odds with the image of the archetypal hard man. His role in the Great Train Robbery (which he refers to as \"a flawed masterpiece\") was that of a Machiavelli - the brains and the ringleader of a crack band of experienced criminals. </p> <p>\"I fully own up to the fact that I was a professional thief,\" he says. \"Maybe it's a question of semantics, but I was a part of what people refer to as a gang, [but] I refer to as a team. If you're a member of a gang, that makes you a gangster. From my point of view a thief is someone who steals the money without the confrontational aspect, whereas a gangster is using the threat of violence to extort money from people directly.\" He pauses to light another fag. \"Now you might say that morally there's not a whole lot of difference, and I suppose there isn't really, but there's not a whole lot of difference between various methods of government either.\"</p> <p>The one black mark against Reynolds, of course, remains the fact that Jack Mills, the engineer on the mail train, was severely beaten in the robbery and never entirely recovered from his injuries. \"Yeah, we were guilty of using violence to achieve out ends but it was never part of our plan. So it shouldn't have happened, but it did happen. It's a personal regret.\"</p> <p>Violence, needless to say, looms large throughout Gangster No. 1. \"Inevitably you could argue that there's been a dumbing-down in cinema because of that,\" Reynolds says. \"It's like Raymond Chandler says: 'When you get stuck with the plot, have someone come through the door with a gun'. You can't lose. But at the same time we're all fascinated about it. To talk about violence is to talk about the history of the world.\" </p> <p>Reynolds describes Gangster No. 1 as a \"slice of life, a Greek tragedy\". He down-plays his own contribution and wryly points out that a lot of his suggestions were eventually rejected. \"I would tell them things that didn't sound right to me - the fact that a getaway driver would get out of the van to join in the action, for instance. Now that would never have happened in my line of work. He stays where he is. He's your lifeline, to get you out of there. But who's to say that it wouldn't have happened at some point? People have their own individual ways of doing things.\" Even so, Reynolds feels that the end product is significantly more accurate a portrait of underworld Britain than, say, Guy Ritchie's debut. \"What, Lock, Stock and Smoked Salmon?\" he laughs. \"I mean, I give it four out of five for entertainment value, but the hype machine got out of control and said it was the new Get Carter, when it manifestly wasn't.\"</p> <p>These days Reynolds lives with his wife in Croydon, dabbles in journalism and reckons he's found a contentment that eluded him even when he was living off his ill-gotten gains in Mexico. He claims he fell into crime in the same way that kids fall into religious cults: because it offered a sense of order, duty and community. \"You're taught the basic rules: to look after each other, not grass people up, help out those who are in trouble,\" he says. \"Except that you later discover, as with all other systems, that there are people at the top who are abusing it for their own ends.\" </p> <p>The Reynolds of today is at once a part of that realm and oddly removed from it.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Dublin crime journalist Veronica Guerin and screenwriter Michael Sheridan began meeting at Cafe Java, near Dublin's O'Connell Street in July 1995, they were working on a film script - about a woman journalist fighting to expose Dublin's heroin underworld - that had no ending and no takers. </p> <p>A year later the final scene was delivered in the best traditions of Dublin's black underworld. It was one o'clock in the afternoon and Guerin was stopped at a motorway traffic light. The horseman of the Apocalypse appeared riding a white 1,000cc Honda and wearing a black helmet. Five bullets were pumped into her red Opel car at close range in broad daylight. She couldn't have written it better herself. </p> <p>Ireland's most famous crime writer, having survived two shootings, was finally taken out by the heroin hoods. No romance, no Bugsy Malones, no Al Capones - just bad, bad men. Hollywood was at her husband's door even as the funeral procession wove its way to the airport cemetery in Dublin's northern suburbs. </p> <p>Disney, Warner Bros and Spielberg began sniffing around the story. Since then two books have been written, a movie has been made and an option remains on a second for Disney. \"Jesus, Veronica has only been dead for seven weeks,\" said her friend Lise Hand at the time, when the speculation over who would play the female lead had already started. </p> <p>In the period since her murder, the number of heroin addicts in Dublin has almost doubled to 13,000. Throughout 1995 and 1996, when Sheridan and Guerin met, she demystified the drug world to him, just as she was explaining it weekly to the readers of Ireland's Sunday Independent. It was inhabited by dangerous men, who the courts couldn't catch, but who were given pseudo-names by the newspaper, and then convicted every Sunday by Guerin.</p> <p>They included Tosser, a killer who masturbated in front of female interrogation officers when he was brought in for questioning, Dutchy, who had his own special method of assassination and the Warehouse Man, who got into the business robbing cigarette warehouses but who would eventually order Guerin's execution. These were the people running a business that last month left six heroin addicts dead in a single day. </p> <p>Guerin had been shot at twice and beaten up before her murder but, as well as selling a lot of newspapers, she was filling a large gap in a justice system which, until her death, was ignoring an epidemic. </p> <p>The men who ran Dublin's drug underworld were, they believed, untouchable. They killed each other off, and the kids their heroin killed died in dark alleyways or bedsits in the wrong part of town. Guerin's thriller-killer series changed all that: it put heroin under the noses of the government and the police, and made Guerin - after just six years in the business - the most famous journalist in Ireland. </p> <p>John Mackenzie's When the Sky Falls is a considerably more authentic portrait of the Dublin underworld than John Boorman's The General - still its best-known depiction. Boorman turned one of the most ruthless of Ireland's criminals, Martin Cahill, into a Jesse James with a brogue. The man who orchestrated some of the most daring robberies in Ireland was given a Van Morrison backing track and became a hero - a chubby chap who, in Boorman's movie, crept round posh Dublin houses with Pink Panther music playing in the background providing for his nine children and two wives. (Both sisters. Nice twist.) Forget the knee-cappings, the blowing up of an elderly forensic scientist who still lives with the agony in his legs. </p> <p>In When the Sky Falls, there's no need to create a heroine. Whatever gave her the incredible drive she had (and the movie doesn't really explain it), she showed huge bravery in her pursuit of the men behind the heroin. </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, when I skirted around the edge of the drug world in Dublin working for the Sunday Tribune, it was a much gentler place. The hoods were flattered by the attention from nice girls who worked from offices on St Stephen's Green, or the Independent on the Quays. </p> <p>In the early 80s, the bad guys were yobs like \"Dazzler\" Dunne, in ill-fitting designer suits, spending their drugs money drinking Dom Perignon in the Leeson Street nightclubs. Most of them were either in prison or dead within a couple of years, leaving their wives and many children with double-glazed PVC conservatories at the back of their council houses, conservatories they filled with wicker furniture and where they would sit for hours telling you things like the Guinness family were killing far more people from sclerosis of the liver than ever got killed by heroin. I remember watching the grandfather of them all, old Bronco Dunne standing on the steps of Criminal Court 16 waving a silver-tipped walking stick in the air and shouting: \"You think we're bad; wait until you see what's coming.\" </p> <p>By the time Guerin started reporting, their successors were running multi-million pound drug empires, with impunity. The police, starved of resources, dealt with their frustration by scraping the heroin bosses' cars with their own keys. The men Guerin started to write about had an awful lot to lose. </p> <p>In the early 80s Dazzler and the boys got their kicks taking their pals to nightclubs; the new men had higher aspirations. They moved out of the slums to the posh suburbs of north Dublin; to nice houses in leafy Kildare or along the sea at Howth. They lived in houses with real French windows - not extensions - and sent their kids to fancy schools while their wives tried to get in with the horsy set. Then along came that bitch Guerin telling the whole street who Dazzler was. </p> <p>The feeding frenzy of publicity that followed her death ensured that Hollywood stepped in swiftly. The resulting film paints a true, brutal picture. There is the treachery of her main informer, who gets his kicks feeding her titbits he likes to read in the Sunday Independent - and then, when she goes too far, shoots her himself. He calls at her front door when she is alone, watching Manchester United on the television. He unscrews the porch light so she doesn't recognise that the man behind the balaclava is the same one that has sat in her car every Tuesday. A man who knows her well but still runs the barrel of a .45 pistol along her thigh before he lets rip. </p> <p>The film-makers tried to get Winona Ryder and Jodie Foster, both of whom apparently expressed interest in playing the part of Guerin. In the end American actress Joan Allen took the role. It's a good performance: warm, funny and, in the end, one that makes you weep. </p> <p>Guerin's death turned her into a national figure. Mary Robinson, the president of Ireland, held her son Cathal, then six years old, at the altar of the airport church in Dublin. The Taioseach joined the crowds paying their last respects at Stafford's Funeral Parlour on the Howth Road. The resulting pressure on the police and the government led to the first real crackdown on heroin for 15 years, when \u00a315m worth of criminal assets were seized. Guerin has undoubtedly saved a lot of lives in the city that took hers. </p> <p>Her grave in a quiet cemetery, lined with poplar trees just off the old Airport Road North, usually has at least one bunch of fresh flowers. The question that lingers is why she kept going, after being beaten up and shot. This film hints at the answer, but doesn't give it. Her newspaper encouraged her to keep going, claiming she was out of control but still allowing her to let her pen scrape along the bones of the most dangerous men in Ireland - great bloody copy. </p> <p>But she was not a child. She was besotted with a job that turned her professional life from the dreariness of a second-rate book-keeper to the stardom of crime reporting. Every week, she led the Irish public on another little tour of her snake pit. The names of the General, the Coach, the Warehouse Man became part of some macabre soap, another week another episode. </p> <p>She kept going, I believe, because she believed passionately that the drug barons should be taken on and because no one seriously considered that the Dublin underworld would begin executing journalists.

      "bodyText": "When Dublin crime journalist Veronica Guerin and screenwriter Michael Sheridan began meeting at Cafe Java, near Dublin's O'Connell Street in July 1995, they were working on a film script - about a woman journalist fighting to expose Dublin's heroin underworld - that had no ending and no takers. A year later the final scene was delivered in the best traditions of Dublin's black underworld. It was one o'clock in the afternoon and Guerin was stopped at a motorway traffic light. The horseman of the Apocalypse appeared riding a white 1,000cc Honda and wearing a black helmet. Five bullets were pumped into her red Opel car at close range in broad daylight. She couldn't have written it better herself. Ireland's most famous crime writer, having survived two shootings, was finally taken out by the heroin hoods. No romance, no Bugsy Malones, no Al Capones - just bad, bad men. Hollywood was at her husband's door even as the funeral procession wove its way to the airport cemetery in Dublin's northern suburbs. Disney, Warner Bros and Spielberg began sniffing around the story. Since then two books have been written, a movie has been made and an option remains on a second for Disney. \"Jesus, Veronica has only been dead for seven weeks,\" said her friend Lise Hand at the time, when the speculation over who would play the female lead had already started. In the period since her murder, the number of heroin addicts in Dublin has almost doubled to 13,000. Throughout 1995 and 1996, when Sheridan and Guerin met, she demystified the drug world to him, just as she was explaining it weekly to the readers of Ireland's Sunday Independent. It was inhabited by dangerous men, who the courts couldn't catch, but who were given pseudo-names by the newspaper, and then convicted every Sunday by Guerin. They included Tosser, a killer who masturbated in front of female interrogation officers when he was brought in for questioning, Dutchy, who had his own special method of assassination and the Warehouse Man, who got into the business robbing cigarette warehouses but who would eventually order Guerin's execution. These were the people running a business that last month left six heroin addicts dead in a single day. Guerin had been shot at twice and beaten up before her murder but, as well as selling a lot of newspapers, she was filling a large gap in a justice system which, until her death, was ignoring an epidemic. The men who ran Dublin's drug underworld were, they believed, untouchable. They killed each other off, and the kids their heroin killed died in dark alleyways or bedsits in the wrong part of town. Guerin's thriller-killer series changed all that: it put heroin under the noses of the government and the police, and made Guerin - after just six years in the business - the most famous journalist in Ireland. John Mackenzie's When the Sky Falls is a considerably more authentic portrait of the Dublin underworld than John Boorman's The General - still its best-known depiction. Boorman turned one of the most ruthless of Ireland's criminals, Martin Cahill, into a Jesse James with a brogue. The man who orchestrated some of the most daring robberies in Ireland was given a Van Morrison backing track and became a hero - a chubby chap who, in Boorman's movie, crept round posh Dublin houses with Pink Panther music playing in the background providing for his nine children and two wives. (Both sisters. Nice twist.) Forget the knee-cappings, the blowing up of an elderly forensic scientist who still lives with the agony in his legs. In When the Sky Falls, there's no need to create a heroine. Whatever gave her the incredible drive she had (and the movie doesn't really explain it), she showed huge bravery in her pursuit of the men behind the heroin. Fifteen years ago, when I skirted around the edge of the drug world in Dublin working for the Sunday Tribune, it was a much gentler place. The hoods were flattered by the attention from nice girls who worked from offices on St Stephen's Green, or the Independent on the Quays. In the early 80s, the bad guys were yobs like \"Dazzler\" Dunne, in ill-fitting designer suits, spending their drugs money drinking Dom Perignon in the Leeson Street nightclubs. Most of them were either in prison or dead within a couple of years, leaving their wives and many children with double-glazed PVC conservatories at the back of their council houses, conservatories they filled with wicker furniture and where they would sit for hours telling you things like the Guinness family were killing far more people from sclerosis of the liver than ever got killed by heroin. I remember watching the grandfather of them all, old Bronco Dunne standing on the steps of Criminal Court 16 waving a silver-tipped walking stick in the air and shouting: \"You think we're bad; wait until you see what's coming.\" By the time Guerin started reporting, their successors were running multi-million pound drug empires, with impunity. The police, starved of resources, dealt with their frustration by scraping the heroin bosses' cars with their own keys. The men Guerin started to write about had an awful lot to lose. In the early 80s Dazzler and the boys got their kicks taking their pals to nightclubs; the new men had higher aspirations. They moved out of the slums to the posh suburbs of north Dublin; to nice houses in leafy Kildare or along the sea at Howth. They lived in houses with real French windows - not extensions - and sent their kids to fancy schools while their wives tried to get in with the horsy set. Then along came that bitch Guerin telling the whole street who Dazzler was. The feeding frenzy of publicity that followed her death ensured that Hollywood stepped in swiftly. The resulting film paints a true, brutal picture. There is the treachery of her main informer, who gets his kicks feeding her titbits he likes to read in the Sunday Independent - and then, when she goes too far, shoots her himself. He calls at her front door when she is alone, watching Manchester United on the television. He unscrews the porch light so she doesn't recognise that the man behind the balaclava is the same one that has sat in her car every Tuesday. A man who knows her well but still runs the barrel of a .45 pistol along her thigh before he lets rip. The film-makers tried to get Winona Ryder and Jodie Foster, both of whom apparently expressed interest in playing the part of Guerin. In the end American actress Joan Allen took the role. It's a good performance: warm, funny and, in the end, one that makes you weep. Guerin's death turned her into a national figure. Mary Robinson, the president of Ireland, held her son Cathal, then six years old, at the altar of the airport church in Dublin. The Taioseach joined the crowds paying their last respects at Stafford's Funeral Parlour on the Howth Road. The resulting pressure on the police and the government led to the first real crackdown on heroin for 15 years, when \u00a315m worth of criminal assets were seized. Guerin has undoubtedly saved a lot of lives in the city that took hers. Her grave in a quiet cemetery, lined with poplar trees just off the old Airport Road North, usually has at least one bunch of fresh flowers. The question that lingers is why she kept going, after being beaten up and shot. This film hints at the answer, but doesn't give it. Her newspaper encouraged her to keep going, claiming she was out of control but still allowing her to let her pen scrape along the bones of the most dangerous men in Ireland - great bloody copy. But she was not a child. She was besotted with a job that turned her professional life from the dreariness of a second-rate book-keeper to the stardom of crime reporting. Every week, she led the Irish public on another little tour of her snake pit. The names of the General, the Coach, the Warehouse Man became part of some macabre soap, another week another episode. She kept going, I believe, because she believed passionately that the drug barons should be taken on and because no one seriously considered that the Dublin underworld would begin executing journalists. Since her death the new Irish gangsters have gone international and moved to Holland where they continue to kill each other. Another Irish mobster was found dead last week in a bloody bedsit, and last month the charred and mutilated bodies of three others appeared in a \u00a3600-a-month flat in Scheveningen just outside the Hague. Ireland's heroin addicts, at an average age of 23, are the youngest in Europe and there are twice as many of them than there were when she was buried by her husband and son under the poplar trees on the old airport road. But at least she tried to expose the awful heroin world that Ireland, its belly fat and purring like a Celtic tiger, was happy to ignore. \u0095 When the Sky Falls is released next Friday.

      "body": "<p>The 1920s were roaring and youth was starting to flame. And dancing in the fire were the flappers, the \"jazz babies\" whose bodies were sleek, whose faces were painted and whose skirts were getting shorter, along with their hair. They were \"fresh\", they flirted and they were determined to kick over their mothers' traces because, as Gloria Swanson boasts in the 1924 movie Manhandled, \"Modern girls do not sit by the fire and knit.\" </p> <p>During the 20s, Hollywood films fanned those flames. They had to because the vast majority of the cinema audience was made up of young women. And because those young women for the first time had the chance to work, unlike their mothers. They could also afford to indulge themselves on their own terms, with money for fashion, make-up and going out to show themselves off. After centuries of servitude, these uncorseted, bob-haired free spirits were free to choose their own entertainment, sexual or otherwise. </p> <p>In short, flappers had girl power. But Laura Mulvey of Birkbeck college, who is currently presenting a season of flapper films at National Film Theatre, thinks that 20s social attitudes changed not so much through women's freedom to purchase products or even select their own politics, but more through their chance to choose their own partners. \"The competition that the new young women presented in the marketplace and the power they gained through the vote was nothing compared to the threat posed at the time by their interest in sexual choice.\" </p> <p>Hollywood had to reflect that interest. They had to find a new female image of liberated sexuality and it couldn't be foreign, voluptuous and fatal like the sultry vamps of the previous decade, who were too exotic and self-conscious for the young girls flooding into cinemas on both sides of the Atlantic. The new image had to be tough and saucy, but also vivacious and good-natured. She had to be a flapper. </p> <p>The woman who would epitomise this spirit was still a girl in 1923. That year, Clara Bow came to her first audition in Hollywood as a 16-year-old, without make-up and in her old clothes, but still ready to perform for the boorish Paramount chief, BP Schulberg. \"Laugh,\" shouted Schulberg. She did, uproariously. \"Stop laughing. Cry.\" Immediately, at the snap of a finger, a flood of tears drenched Bow's cheeks. \"She's an emotional machine,\" Schulberg cried out in glee. </p> <p>Bow wasn't quite that, but working women responded to her warmth, sense of abandon and unsophisticated sexuality. Bow's intentions were never veiled like Garbo or Jean Harlow's. Setting eyes on the male of her choice in It, the film that launched her, Bow puckers her brow and sticks her hip forward before setting off into action with the brief, admiring exclamation: \"Hot socks!\" Here, for the first time on the US screen, was a woman who not only knew about sex but openly showed she enjoyed it. </p> <p>Clara Bow was far bigger than the other flapper film stars, Gloria Swanson, Marion Davies and Joan Crawford. Her fan mail ran to over 1,000 letters a day, some addressed simply to \"The It Girl, Hollywood\". Her fame reached beyond a name but the famous \"It\" that she embodied - the term created by the English novelist, Elinor Glyn - didn't just connote sex appeal. \"He or she must be entirely unselfconscious,\" Glyn insisted, \"and full of self-confidence and indifferent to the effect he or she is producing.\" In other words, \"It\" wasn't just a matter of looking sexy, but also having a sexy mind and an optimistic outlook. </p> <p>Clara Bow had all of it by the cartload. She had pizazz. As the go-getting shopgirl who sets her cap at the boss in It, she shuts out a potential rival with the threat, \"I'll soon take the snap out of her garters.\" But she also shows loyalty to female friends, claiming an illegitimate child as her own because, otherwise, the real unmarried mother would be shunned. </p> <p>\"Clara is prepared to be seen as an unmarried mother,\" says Laura Mulvey, \"not only because she thinks her boyfriend's suspicions are vulgar beyond belief but also because she has to show solidarity with a friend. She shows she's a sensible working girl.\" No doubt working women would have respected that solidarity, but they would have identified even more closely with the roles Bow played and especially with the way their heroine had to make do. </p> <p>Working girls in the audience would have noticed especially that Bow makes her own dress for the evening by cutting up an old frock and sticking odd bits and pieces on to it. \"Those sort of off-the-peg fashions went to Europe where the flapper image had a huge impact,\" says Mulvey. \"If you used paper patterns to copy movie stars' fashions, that meant you could stop looking like your mother and, perhaps even more importantly, stop following the fashion dictated by the aristocracy. So the idea that you could look like a movie star was an enormous liberation for young working women.\" </p> <p>The new wave of female liberation, however, stirred up constant backlashes from the heartland, from churches and from Christian women and temperance groups. At the centre of the moral storm, the star, who had almost single-handedly democratised glamour, fought back against constrictions now being imposed by her studio. Bow refused to sign the morality clause inserted into her contract by Paramount - which insisted you couldn't behave \"in any way which would bring the studio into disrepute.\" But scandal rocked her. \"If she has 'IT' they get 'IT',\" screamed a Hollywood tabloid, referring to her many lovers, who included Gary Cooper. </p> <p>Also, she had been so overworked - she made 29 feature films in 1925-26 - that it was little wonder Schulberg referred to her as \"Crisis-a-day-Clara\". The films soon became stuck in Cinderella plots, in which Bow's shop girl flapped her way past snooty rivals into a millionaire's arms. By 1931, she was bored into submission and she left Hollywood, aged only 26. \"All they were interested in was my box-office appeal,\" she later said. \"I made them millions but I received nothing but a salary, untrained leading men, and any old story they fished out of wastebaskets.\" </p> <p>Mulvey believes that cynicism played a big part in the plotting of Clara's movies, but adds: \"What I don't think is cynical at all is the power and persona of Clara Bow on the screen. Her presence up there is incredibly important to the culture of the time because it was emblematic of what young, modern womanhood stood for - independence: living on your own, earning your own living and being prepared to put your friends before romance.\" </p> <p>Maybe that kind of aspiration was possible in flapper films only because they were so revolutionary. After all, apart from computer-generated characters like Lara Croft, who is providing a role model for the flappers of tomorrow?</p> <p><strong>How to be a flapper</strong></p> <p>Tom Dewe Mathews gets the lowdown from Jenny Hammerton, senior cataloguer at Path\u00e9: </p> <p><strong> Figure: </strong>You have to be shaped like rolled-up linoleum - straight up and and down, no curves, or that diamante-beaded dress won't drop straight from the shoulder. Don't forget girdles and corsetry had been abandoned by the 20s, so anything over B-cup and you'll have to bind that bust down. </p> <p><strong> Dress: </strong>The dress has to be tip-top, embroidered velvet or brocade with peek-a-boo slinky net sleeves, jewelled chiffon or the most sumptuous layer upon layer of beaded fabulousness. Don't forget that your dress should be designed to be seen in movement. </p> <p><strong> Accessories: </strong>Certain accoutrements are compulsory: a long cigarette holder obviously, but also a mascot - a lapdog, preferably, or a doll. The more smoking paraphernalia the better. Trinkets such as a cigarette dispenser in which you press a button and your cigarette comes out and lights itself are indispensable. Cigarettes can be secreted away in your garter but always in a case, never in the packet. </p> <p><strong> Gadgets: </strong>If you can't afford a car or don't have a beau who has a car and therefore have to walk to work, you need a \"Button-up Rubber Stocking Protector\" that hooks over the heel of your shoe and buttons up along the front. You can walk through muddy streets and when you arrive at the office you'll look as though you are rich enough to drive yourself to work. </p> <p><strong> Tips: </strong>Like that quintessential socialite-flapper Tallulah Bankhead, keep your lipstick bedded on ice, then just before you apply it, dip it in bourbon. Another top tip from Bebe Daniels in the flapper film Why Change Your Wife? is to up-end your perfume bottle, use the stopper to dab yourself on the neck and the usual pulse spots, but then add a dab to the centre of your top lip - then he'll swoon in the clinch. </p> <p><strong> Dance: </strong>\"It\": you have to have \"It\" of course, but if you show too much of \"It\" on the dance floor, then you need the \"Buffer Belt\" which you tie around your waist from where a series of ribbon-covered, flat-ended prongs stick out. That way your dance partner can't get too close. But don't forget, the Buffer Belt does not protect your rear.</p> <p>\u0095 The film season Flappers: The \"It\" Girls of the 1920s runs until June 30 at London's NFT (Details: 020 7928 3232).</p>",

Setting eyes on the male of her choice in It, the film that launched her, Bow puckers her brow and sticks her hip forward before setting off into action with the brief, admiring exclamation: \"Hot socks!\" Here, for the first time on the US screen, was a woman who not only knew about sex but openly showed she enjoyed it. Clara Bow was far bigger than the other flapper film stars, Gloria Swanson, Marion Davies and Joan Crawford. Her fan mail ran to over 1,000 letters a day, some addressed simply to \"The It Girl, Hollywood\". Her fame reached beyond a name but the famous \"It\" that she embodied - the term created by the English novelist, Elinor Glyn - didn't just connote sex appeal. \"He or she must be entirely unselfconscious,\" Glyn insisted, \"and full of self-confidence and indifferent to the effect he or she is producing.\" In other words, \"It\" wasn't just a matter of looking sexy, but also having a sexy mind and an optimistic outlook. Clara Bow had all of it by the cartload. She had pizazz. As the go-getting shopgirl who sets her cap at the boss in It, she shuts out a potential rival with the threat, \"I'll soon take the snap out of her garters.\" But she also shows loyalty to female friends, claiming an illegitimate child as her own because, otherwise, the real unmarried mother would be shunned. \"Clara is prepared to be seen as an unmarried mother,\" says Laura Mulvey, \"not only because she thinks her boyfriend's suspicions are vulgar beyond belief but also because she has to show solidarity with a friend. She shows she's a sensible working girl.\" No doubt working women would have respected that solidarity, but they would have identified even more closely with the roles Bow played and especially with the way their heroine had to make do. Working girls in the audience would have noticed especially that Bow makes her own dress for the evening by cutting up an old frock and sticking odd bits and pieces on to it. \"Those sort of off-the-peg fashions went to Europe where the flapper image had a huge impact,\" says Mulvey. \"If you used paper patterns to copy movie stars' fashions, that meant you could stop looking like your mother and, perhaps even more importantly, stop following the fashion dictated by the aristocracy. So the idea that you could look like a movie star was an enormous liberation for young working women.\" The new wave of female liberation, however, stirred up constant backlashes from the heartland, from churches and from Christian women and temperance groups. At the centre of the moral storm, the star, who had almost single-handedly democratised glamour, fought back against constrictions now being imposed by her studio. Bow refused to sign the morality clause inserted into her contract by Paramount - which insisted you couldn't behave \"in any way which would bring the studio into disrepute.\" But scandal rocked her. \"If she has 'IT' they get 'IT',\" screamed a Hollywood tabloid, referring to her many lovers, who included Gary Cooper. Also, she had been so overworked - she made 29 feature films in 1925-26 - that it was little wonder Schulberg referred to her as \"Crisis-a-day-Clara\". The films soon became stuck in Cinderella plots, in which Bow's shop girl flapped her way past snooty rivals into a millionaire's arms. By 1931, she was bored into submission and she left Hollywood, aged only 26. \"All they were interested in was my box-office appeal,\" she later said. \"I made them millions but I received nothing but a salary, untrained leading men, and any old story they fished out of wastebaskets.\" Mulvey believes that cynicism played a big part in the plotting of Clara's movies, but adds: \"What I don't think is cynical at all is the power and persona of Clara Bow on the screen. Her presence up there is incredibly important to the culture of the time because it was emblematic of what young, modern womanhood stood for - independence: living on your own, earning your own living and being prepared to put your friends before romance.\" Maybe that kind of aspiration was possible in flapper films only because they were so revolutionary. After all, apart from computer-generated characters like Lara Croft, who is providing a role model for the flappers of tomorrow? How to be a flapper Tom Dewe Mathews gets the lowdown from Jenny Hammerton, senior cataloguer at Path\u00e9: Figure: You have to be shaped like rolled-up linoleum - straight up and and down, no curves, or that diamante-beaded dress won't drop straight from the shoulder. Don't forget girdles and corsetry had been abandoned by the 20s, so anything over B-cup and you'll have to bind that bust down. Dress: The dress has to be tip-top, embroidered velvet or brocade with peek-a-boo slinky net sleeves, jewelled chiffon or the most sumptuous layer upon layer of beaded fabulousness. Don't forget that your dress should be designed to be seen in movement. Accessories: Certain accoutrements are compulsory: a long cigarette holder obviously, but also a mascot - a lapdog, preferably, or a doll. The more smoking paraphernalia the better. Trinkets such as a cigarette dispenser in which you press a button and your cigarette comes out and lights itself are indispensable. Cigarettes can be secreted away in your garter but always in a case, never in the packet. Gadgets: If you can't afford a car or don't have a beau who has a car and therefore have to walk to work, you need a \"Button-up Rubber Stocking Protector\" that hooks over the heel of your shoe and buttons up along the front. You can walk through muddy streets and when you arrive at the office you'll look as though you are rich enough to drive yourself to work. Tips: Like that quintessential socialite-flapper Tallulah Bankhead, keep your lipstick bedded on ice, then just before you apply it, dip it in bourbon. Another top tip from Bebe Daniels in the flapper film Why Change Your Wife? is to up-end your perfume bottle, use the stopper to dab yourself on the neck and the usual pulse spots, but then add a dab to the centre of your top lip - then he'll swoon in the clinch. Dance: \"It\": you have to have \"It\" of course, but if you show too much of \"It\" on the dance floor, then you need the \"Buffer Belt\" which you tie around your waist from where a series of ribbon-covered, flat-ended prongs stick out. That way your dance partner can't get too close. But don't forget, the Buffer Belt does not protect your rear. \u0095 The film season Flappers: The \"It\" Girls of the 1920s runs until June 30 at London's NFT (Details: 020 7928 3232).",

In the surprisingly non-raunchy Une Liaison Pornographique (An Intimate Affair, as the subtitle discreetly puts it), he plays a man who regularly meets a woman in a Paris hotel room to indulge some unspecified sexual peccadillo. A prominent still from the thriller Harry, A Friend Who Wishes You Well, recently in Cannes, has Lopez in the ultimate sensitive-macho pose - bare-chested and hirsute, gazing longingly at an egg (his rule is: one to be taken directly after sex). </p> <p>Hunky, maybe, but creepy and not a little ridiculous - these are the parts that Lopez is making his speciality. Harry, in Dominik Moll's thriller, is an amiable maniac who attaches himself, like Mr Ripley, to a hapless young couple, then starts \"solving\" their domestic problems. In Britain, Lopez is best known for Western, a small but delectable comedy by Manuel Poirier, in which he plays a weary, jowly Lothario, a shoe salesman who ends up schlepping round Breton back roads with a Russian drifter. </p> <p>This year was Lopez's second stint at Cannes, and the first time he has been there as a known face. But he's not yet jaded enough to just turn up and do the job. The words tumble out in French heavily laced with his Catalan accent and the odd comic sound effect, as he lights cigarette after cigarette, hands weaving in the air, heavy eyebrows flying up in shows of comic delight. Bulky but always on the verge of being carried aloft by his enthusiasm, Lopez seems the opposite of his sullenly chunky screen parts. </p> <p>He grew up, and still lives, in a village 45km south of Barcelona. He kept re-taking years at school, and his father, who worked in the local Pirelli factory, didn't approve of his waywardness. Lopez recalls the day he announced he was going to act. \"My father said, 'Make sure you're home by 10.' I came in at one. He was sitting there...\" He crosses his arms, the statue of an angry patriarch. \"His leg was shaking\" - he demonstrates a furious St Vitus Dance - \"which meant he was - wahhh! - set to explode! 'Where have you been?' I said, 'Look, I've just decided - I'm going to be an actor.' He was really - whpp!\" - an invisible lid flies off. \"His leg goes - hop!\" - the leg flies up - \"and he calms down. 'Acting? Fair enough. Go ahead.' \" </p> <p>Lopez went to Paris to the famous Lecoq stage school, with just enough French to pick up his room keys. Eventually he went to a casting session for a film, even though he'd never given cinema a second thought. The audition was for director Manuel Poirier, and they ended up making five films together, the fifth of which was Western. </p> <p>Western is one of those rare films that appears to have just happened of its own accord - the right pair of actors (Lopez, and wispy, poker-faced Sacha Bourdo) just drifting from event to event. That's partly the result of Poirier's insistence on shooting chronologically. \"Usually, it's 'OK, you've just done something we haven't shot yet, and you're going somewhere we haven't seen yet.' \"</p> <p>Surprisingly, hardly anything in Western was improvised. That's the point, says Lopez. \"What you try and do when you act is make people think you're improvising - that there's no script, no direction, that you're just living it.\" All being well, this trick will come again in his sixth film with Poirier, recently shot in Peru, in which he has a small role as a pianist. \"I've never played the piano in my life. I probably never will. But I play a pianist.\" He gives a big \"go figure\" shrug. </p> <p>Harry... is a whole other story, where Lopez is expansive, hail-fellow-well-met, but a well-wisher to leave you feeling faintly ill. Dominik Moll originally offered him the role not of the killer, but the husband. \"I said, 'OK, I could play the husband. Or the wife, or the girlfriend, or the little girl. I don't mind playing the little girl.' \" He does a little mumble, in character as the director. 'Yeah, I don't know, er... what about Harry?' 'Oh, yes! Yes, please!' \" </p> <p>Harry works so well as a character because he's unsettlingly repellent, even while seeming a terribly, terribly nice man. \"People often say I have a nice face,\" says Lopez. \"I tend to play positive, well-balanced people. But just because you've got a nice face doesn't mean you can't play a villain. If you put your hand behind your back, you could be holding a knife or you could be holding a flower. The face doesn't change either way.\" </p> <p>Lopez prefers to approach his characters on a need-to-know basis, and to hell with their back story. \"Not interested. I don't like to knock myself out. It doesn't help me to have too much information in my head.\" This blank approach reaches an extreme in Une Affaire Pornographique, where Lopez simply plays \"Him\" to Nathalie Baye's \"Her\". Not only do we never learn what the couple get up to behind hotel doors, we never get the basic facts about their private lives either. They just simmer gently, no questions asked. Lopez has turned his own natural volume down close to zero. \"The point was not to give him any distinguishing features. His main distinguishing feature is his accent - which happens to be my accent anyway.\" </p> <p>Nor is he willing to speculate on the couple's fetish. \"We thought, 'Should we decide among ourselves what they do, and then we'll know and no one else will?' Then we said, OK, I'll think of something but then if I tell you what it is, you might go, 'Oh, that's your fantasy? But I do it every Wednesday.' \" </p> <p>Currently stacking up high-profile projects in France and Spain, Lopez is new enough to the game to still be bemused by the attention. \"When you come to a place like this,\" he says, gesturing round the hotel lobby, \"everyone flatters you, and it's all a bit... surrealistic. You meet people from Brazil or Austria and you have no idea who they are, but they know you.\" </p> <p>He gets a sense of its arbitrariness from his four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son, who once spotted their dad in the paper, and now keep pointing to photos of other men, convinced they are him. They also find pictures of women who they think are their mother - \"and she's nothing to do with cinema, she does a normal nine-to-five job.\" As for the angry patriarch, his leg stopped shaking long ago. \"He photocopies all the articles about me and goes round the village bars, showing them to his friends.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Une Liaison Pornographique is released next Friday.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Rupert Everett is in reckless mood. \"Make me say something outrageous. I don't want to sound bland or boring,\" he calls after me as I leave his hotel suite. Having talked to me for over an hour from a horizontal position on his bed, he has grown sick of the sound of his own voice.</p> <p>Everett is in London to promote his new film, The Next Best Thing, in which he plays another gay best friend, this time Madonna's. Since Hollywood likes to repeat an actor's success, he was cast on the strength of his performance in My Best Friend's Wedding, in which he played alongside Julia Roberts. This film, however, is significantly darker. The plot revolves around a one-night stand, a baby and a paternity lawsuit and Everett's involvement has been such that at one point he was also producing.</p> <p>\"But then I was fired because they wanted to control me,\" he says. I ask if his ego took a battering. \"No,\" he shrugs. \"You can't be too proud in show business. You have to always be prepared to stand down.\"</p> <p>Everett doesn't go out of his way to make you like him, and it's an appealing trait. It's rare to meet an actor so comfortable with imperfection and so disarmingly frank. Part of him, he says, is \"a huge, momentous, attention-grabbing opportunist\" - which is what catapulted him into acting in the first place.</p> <p>He enjoys complaining. \"All actors like to complain as it's a way of letting off steam.\" And he doesn't mind being bored either, which is why he likes sitting round on film sets all day. He says he is lazy but has enough of the catholic upper-class upbringing (he was educated at Ampleforth) to prevent him sinking into sloth.</p> <p>He'd like to be less selfish but it doesn't come naturally. \"Living is quite difficult,\" he confesses. \"You're constantly worrying about how to keep going and get on to the next step. Your career takes over and you close down and focus on yourself and your survival.\"</p> <p>Friendship is important to him and he keeps in touch with the people from the troughs as well as the highs. Everett's career has progressed in fits and starts. The huge success of Another Country in the mid-80s thrust him into prominence. But after its successor, Dance With a Stranger, he lost his way in an ill-fated attempt to become a rock star and the famously dreadful rock 'n' roll movie Hearts of Fire, co-starring Bob Dylan. Britain turned nasty on him for a time and he retreated to Paris to lick his wounds.</p> <p>His novels (most recently Hello Darling, Are You Working) have also been slated but he says people miss the point - they're meant to be trash. Besides, his writing skills are now in huge demand: he has two film scripts on the go. But he re-emerged splendidly in 1995 in The Madness of King George as a fat Prince of Wales. Suddenly, critics were won over again.</p> <p>In the last three years, Everett's reputation has risen again following the success of My Best Friend's Wedding, in which he was famously written into the final scene when test audiences insisted he had a bigger bite of the cherry. Since then he has become one of the very few \"out\" gay actors in America. He doesn't particularly like being Hollywood's \"token queer\" because his sexuality has never been an issue for him, but now, if he's typecast, he says it's more for his Englishness than sexual orientation.</p> <p>His films make big bucks. But he frowns at any suggestion that he's had superstar status bestowed on him: \"I'm absolutely not that huge,\" he insists. While America can't get enough of him, he's not sure how he's regarded in Britain, or indeed whether he has ever got over earlier perceptions of him as a hooray Henry.</p> <p>People tend to forget that Everett is also a fine and versatile stage actor. His portrayal of a \"queen\" with dementia in Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More received widespread acclaim and, more recently, a performance of The Importance of Being Earnest in Paris had audiences queuing round the block.</p> <p>But possibly the single film which has affected him most is And Quiet Flows the Don, which he filmed in Russia in 1991. During the 18 months of filming there were four deaths - on the first week the man running the wind machine (an old aeroplane propeller) was decapitated in front of his eyes. \"It was such a harsh world but an amazing experience which made me realise how much complaining and whingeing I'd done all my life. I was 30 and it was good for me to be taken away from my London club scene of boys and sex.\"</p> <p>Now 40, he says he feels more content with the past, and also more restless. For a year he has been planning to go with Oxfam to Africa but back-to-back filming has ruled out taking even a week out of schedule. The planned trip is part of a growing desire to do something more with his life. \"I see my family getting older and then I see myself getting older and it makes me realise we're all future corpses,\" he says. \"That thought colours everything for me at the moment.\"</p> <p>He is modest about his skills as an actor too. \"Rather in the same way that we as human beings have this pride in ourselves because we've decided we're modelled in the image of God, I think actors as artistes are a little bit jumped up as well because all we really are are artisans. It's actually much easier to do the job if you keep that at the back of your mind.\"</p> <p>He has strong views on love and blames the way it's treated on the silver screen for people's false perceptions of relationships. \"In my view, love in the cinema is far more dangerous than violence in the cinema because it's so idealistic and charged. If you expect to go into a relationship with the volume bumped up to ecstasy level from the moment you meet to the moment you croak, it won't work. I think relationships are rather like a job. They're hard work, boring, depressing and claustrophobic, but then they're fantastic for 10 seconds too. Rather like the English weather.\"</p> <p>Asked to elaborate on his own love life, and he politely declines. This is now a fiercely guarded no-go area, which, in the past, he has spoken about too freely. He does, however, say several times that The Next Best Thing is a very good film on love, and he likes the way there's \"a certain blurring of the edges between the two main characters\".</p> <p>Is there the same kind of blurring of the edges in his real-life relationship with Madonna - frequently described as his best friend. This, he says is mad: \"I don't want best friends. I want a lot of people around me who I like a lot. But she's certainly a good friend.\"</p> <p>They joined forces on The Next Best Thing to try to remould the script and their characters. The production company, nervous about how middle America would react to a film about a gay man fathering a child, prevented them from making too many modifications, but when Everett was told that his character couldn't have any kind of homosexual life after he'd had the child, he successfully argued that this was unrealistic and undramatic.</p> <p>\"When I first got the script it was a kind of 70s sitcom with two very stereotypical characters - mine being the standard asexual queen with a heart of gold, Madonna's being the bitter, badly fucked woman wanting a life. There's nothing I've got against the stereotypical flubby queen but at some point it becomes patronising to gay people. I wanted a character who was nothing to do with being gay and a film that had nothing to do with coming to terms with social dysfunction. He just is homosexual and it's not a problem.\"</p> <p>This is clearly Everett on Everett. If he gets defensive about being gay it's because people are always asking about it. \"I'm gay now, I was gay last year, I will be gay next year and there's nothing new to add to that.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Next Best Thing opens on June 23.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Everett is in reckless mood. \"Make me say something outrageous. I don't want to sound bland or boring,\" he calls after me as I leave his hotel suite. Having talked to me for over an hour from a horizontal position on his bed, he has grown sick of the sound of his own voice. Everett is in London to promote his new film, The Next Best Thing, in which he plays another gay best friend, this time Madonna's. Since Hollywood likes to repeat an actor's success, he was cast on the strength of his performance in My Best Friend's Wedding, in which he played alongside Julia Roberts. This film, however, is significantly darker. The plot revolves around a one-night stand, a baby and a paternity lawsuit and Everett's involvement has been such that at one point he was also producing. \"But then I was fired because they wanted to control me,\" he says. I ask if his ego took a battering. \"No,\" he shrugs. \"You can't be too proud in show business. You have to always be prepared to stand down.\" Everett doesn't go out of his way to make you like him, and it's an appealing trait. It's rare to meet an actor so comfortable with imperfection and so disarmingly frank. Part of him, he says, is \"a huge, momentous, attention-grabbing opportunist\" - which is what catapulted him into acting in the first place. He enjoys complaining. \"All actors like to complain as it's a way of letting off steam.\" And he doesn't mind being bored either, which is why he likes sitting round on film sets all day. He says he is lazy but has enough of the catholic upper-class upbringing (he was educated at Ampleforth) to prevent him sinking into sloth. He'd like to be less selfish but it doesn't come naturally. \"Living is quite difficult,\" he confesses. \"You're constantly worrying about how to keep going and get on to the next step. Your career takes over and you close down and focus on yourself and your survival.\" Friendship is important to him and he keeps in touch with the people from the troughs as well as the highs. Everett's career has progressed in fits and starts. The huge success of Another Country in the mid-80s thrust him into prominence. But after its successor, Dance With a Stranger, he lost his way in an ill-fated attempt to become a rock star and the famously dreadful rock 'n' roll movie Hearts of Fire, co-starring Bob Dylan. Britain turned nasty on him for a time and he retreated to Paris to lick his wounds. His novels (most recently Hello Darling, Are You Working) have also been slated but he says people miss the point - they're meant to be trash. Besides, his writing skills are now in huge demand: he has two film scripts on the go. But he re-emerged splendidly in 1995 in The Madness of King George as a fat Prince of Wales. Suddenly, critics were won over again. In the last three years, Everett's reputation has risen again following the success of My Best Friend's Wedding, in which he was famously written into the final scene when test audiences insisted he had a bigger bite of the cherry. Since then he has become one of the very few \"out\" gay actors in America. He doesn't particularly like being Hollywood's \"token queer\" because his sexuality has never been an issue for him, but now, if he's typecast, he says it's more for his Englishness than sexual orientation. His films make big bucks. But he frowns at any suggestion that he's had superstar status bestowed on him: \"I'm absolutely not that huge,\" he insists. While America can't get enough of him, he's not sure how he's regarded in Britain, or indeed whether he has ever got over earlier perceptions of him as a hooray Henry. People tend to forget that Everett is also a fine and versatile stage actor. His portrayal of a \"queen\" with dementia in Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any More received widespread acclaim and, more recently, a performance of The Importance of Being Earnest in Paris had audiences queuing round the block. But possibly the single film which has affected him most is And Quiet Flows the Don, which he filmed in Russia in 1991. During the 18 months of filming there were four deaths - on the first week the man running the wind machine (an old aeroplane propeller) was decapitated in front of his eyes. \"It was such a harsh world but an amazing experience which made me realise how much complaining and whingeing I'd done all my life. I was 30 and it was good for me to be taken away from my London club scene of boys and sex.\" Now 40, he says he feels more content with the past, and also more restless. For a year he has been planning to go with Oxfam to Africa but back-to-back filming has ruled out taking even a week out of schedule. The planned trip is part of a growing desire to do something more with his life. \"I see my family getting older and then I see myself getting older and it makes me realise we're all future corpses,\" he says. \"That thought colours everything for me at the moment.\" He is modest about his skills as an actor too. \"Rather in the same way that we as human beings have this pride in ourselves because we've decided we're modelled in the image of God, I think actors as artistes are a little bit jumped up as well because all we really are are artisans. It's actually much easier to do the job if you keep that at the back of your mind.\" He has strong views on love and blames the way it's treated on the silver screen for people's false perceptions of relationships. \"In my view, love in the cinema is far more dangerous than violence in the cinema because it's so idealistic and charged. If you expect to go into a relationship with the volume bumped up to ecstasy level from the moment you meet to the moment you croak, it won't work. I think relationships are rather like a job. They're hard work, boring, depressing and claustrophobic, but then they're fantastic for 10 seconds too. Rather like the English weather.\" Asked to elaborate on his own love life, and he politely declines. This is now a fiercely guarded no-go area, which, in the past, he has spoken about too freely. He does, however, say several times that The Next Best Thing is a very good film on love, and he likes the way there's \"a certain blurring of the edges between the two main characters\". Is there the same kind of blurring of the edges in his real-life relationship with Madonna - frequently described as his best friend. This, he says is mad: \"I don't want best friends. I want a lot of people around me who I like a lot. But she's certainly a good friend.\" They joined forces on The Next Best Thing to try to remould the script and their characters. The production company, nervous about how middle America would react to a film about a gay man fathering a child, prevented them from making too many modifications, but when Everett was told that his character couldn't have any kind of homosexual life after he'd had the child, he successfully argued that this was unrealistic and undramatic. \"When I first got the script it was a kind of 70s sitcom with two very stereotypical characters - mine being the standard asexual queen with a heart of gold, Madonna's being the bitter, badly fucked woman wanting a life. There's nothing I've got against the stereotypical flubby queen but at some point it becomes patronising to gay people. I wanted a character who was nothing to do with being gay and a film that had nothing to do with coming to terms with social dysfunction. He just is homosexual and it's not a problem.\" This is clearly Everett on Everett. If he gets defensive about being gay it's because people are always asking about it. \"I'm gay now, I was gay last year, I will be gay next year and there's nothing new to add to that.\" \u0095 The Next Best Thing opens on June 23.",

And one about gangsters as well, a genre which has exposed like no other the fatuity, cluelessness and onanism of our bright young British movie stars? Incredibly, yes it can. Just when the talentless lottery gangster film has pretty well become a contemporary cultural crisis, director Paul McGuigan comes along with Gangster No 1, a tough 60s-set thriller: plausible and sure-footed, a film with a canny yet appalled sense of the repulsive realities of crime and the unlovely, unfunny people involved in it. It is scorchingly violent, sinister, with a strange undertow of melodrama and self-loathing. </p> <p>Malcolm McDowell is an ageing mobster and sociopathically nasty piece of work glimpsed first at a gruesome black-tie boxing event; he hears that an old business associate, one Freddie Mays, is to be released from prison after nearly 30 years. This leads to a long flashback of his and Freddie's early days in the bi-polar gangland of 60s London: the twin turfs of the East End and Soho. David Thewlis is the fastidious, dandyish Mays and Paul Bettany is McDowell's younger self, clean-cut, sinisterly handsome, turned out with fanatical care, and impressively resembling the young Michael Caine in his fiercely serious mode - checking out his reflection in the mirrors of tallboys and the backs of ashtrays. </p> <p>\"Gangster lean\" is an evocative New York phrase noted by Susanna Moore in her novel In the Cut, meaning a special wiseguy way of leaning or lounging in a car; the principals and supporting cast alike are giving it plenty of lean here; the phrase came into my head watching them leaning in their clubs and bars, their Dolomites, Rovers and E-types. </p> <p>Gangster No 1 has a strong sense of the geography and furnishings of this period: the occult markings of London transcribed by writers like Iain Sinclair and Jake Arnott. Freddie himself lives in an outrageously fancy 60s apartment - impressively reconstructed - in which he is wont to relax with a drink from the sideboard and Matt Monro on the turntable. But we are never invited to luxuriate in retro naff: what is important is shabbiness, and sadness. </p> <p>Even people who profess to be gangster cognoscenti are sometimes vague about what real gangsters actually do on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis to get their money. (In his Adventures In The Screen Trade, William Goldman famously denounced \"cute Mafia chieftains\" in supposedly realistic dramas like The Godfather: \"Try asking a major star to play a real Mafia head, a man who makes his living off whores and child pornography, heroin and blood.\") There is some residual cuteness in Gangster No 1, but Paul McGuigan certainly jettisons the tiresome Lock, Stock sense that gangsters are adorable stand-up comedy merchants with the gift of the gab. </p> <p>As the young gangster, Paul Bettany is an unpleasant inadequate: convulsed with envy for what he imagines is Mays' mastery of the good life, neurotically concerned with imitating his boss's snappy suits, and ferociously unpleasant to Mays' fianc\u00e9e Karen (Saffron Burrows) - thus sublimating homoerotic impulses into weirdly impotent nastiness. All the bigotry and sheer ugliness of gangsterism that was airbrushed away in inanities like Love, Honour and Obey are here in abundance. </p> <p>McGuigan's central scene is the young gangster's orgy of sadistic violence against a rival boss, meted out with an ironmonger's tools. No Tarantinoesque slant of comedy: it is just claustrophobic and disgusting. It is at these moments where Paul McGuigan appears persuasively to suggest that the gangster film works not as a type of action movie, or black comedy, but as a species of horror film. </p> <p>Gangster No 1 is not for everyone; there is something in the world it conjures up - at once banal and excessive - which may not appeal. It consciously (and laudably) refuses the confectionery of comedy and farce, and it can be unsubtle. McDowell sneers at the camera: \"What d'you take me for - a CUNT?\" (the answer is yes, yes, a thousand times yes, incidentally) but that c-word at least shows a candid grasp of real gangster idiom primly avoided by, say, All Saints and David A Stewart. </p> <p>Let's give thanks for a film that isn't just a bunch of actors who hang out with their cocaine dealers and think they know what criminals are like.

The reviews have been overwhelming but not one person here has contacted me,\" says Hodges at home in Dorset. \"I'm not whining, but maybe they're ashamed.\" </p> <p>The movie, commissioned by Channel 4's film arm and made for \u00a33m, has Clive Owen as a struggling writer within whom attachment and detachment do battle when he takes a job in a London casino. \"They really didn't like it,\" says Hodges. \"David Aukin [then head of FilmFour] said when he saw it: 'The only thing I like about this film is the credits at the end.' I haven't spoken to him since. They didn't think there was a market for it. At least they were courteous enough to leave the film the way I made it.\" </p> <p>Aukin, who says he is delighted by Croupier's success in America, does not quite agree with Hodges's recollections. \"I had left Channel 4 at the time it was distributed here but I recall it had only a modest outing. It's easy to blame the distributor but the fact is the reviews, word of mouth, didn't bring in an audience. I did of course champion the film and am a great fan of the screenplay by Paul Mayersberg. It's fair to say I have mixed feelings about the final film but I'd be thrilled if the success of the film in the States encourages FilmFour to resdistribute it in the UK.\" </p> <p>Paul Webster, who has Aukin's old job at FilmFour, agrees that Croupier represents a missed opportunity in the UK but says that it cannot be rereleased. \"I'm not hiding behind anything but all this went down before I joined FilmFour,\" he says. \"To rerelease a movie in this densely crowded, exhibitor driven market would be tantamount to impossible. I like the movie a lot. Yes, I think it could have been platformed more aggressively but it's thrilling that Mike Hodges has now got his just desserts.\" </p> <p>\"The new management weren't interested at all,\" said Hodges. \"They put it in Berlin's film market, which is like putting it in the morgue. I don't think distributors were even aware that it existed.\" </p> <p>The BFI was reissuing Get Carter and Hodges suggested that it might also distribute Croupier. \"It got incredibly good reviews but it didn't help that they didn't have a trailer or a poster and there were only two prints. It had absolutely no chance.\" Croupier might have gone the way of other Hodges projects such as 1991's Black Rainbow (straight to cable TV) or the IRA story from 1987, A Prayer for the Dying (chopped about by the Goldwyn Company). Then it was shown at a Hodges retrospective in LA and Michael Kaplan, a movie marketing strategist who has worked with films by Kubrick and Altman, drew it to the attention of the Shooting Gallery, a distributor based in Manhattan. It made more than $500,000 in its first month on release. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Hodges is in Dorset working on treatments of the Thomas Mann story Mario and the Magician and a script of his own, Grist. And when might either of these go into production? \"Oh, please. Just look at my CV. It's got holes in it like a Swiss cheese.\"</p>",

Yet the pair's latest novel, seventh instalment in the Left Behind series which they first started writing in 1995, topped Amazon.com's bestseller list in April based on advance orders alone, and on Sunday it is expected to move straight to first place in the coveted New York Times fiction bestseller list, an unparalleled achievement for a genre novel of this kind. The new book, The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession, combines science fiction with an apocalyptic fundamentalism of which Americans seemingly cannot get enough. The conservative slant of the two authors is underscored by the fact that the villain of the new book, an incarnation of the Antichrist, turns out to be a former secretary general of the United Nations, an organisation which many American conservatives believe is at the centre of an international conspiracy to overthrow the US constitution and establish a world government which would ban the private ownership of firearms and establish a global single currency. In the new novel, the hero of the series, Rayford Steele, falls under suspicion of assassinating the Antichrist. Another hero is a converted Jew, who has accepted Christ as the messiah. Mr LaHaye is among many conservative fundamentalists who insist that Jews must be converted to Christianity as part of the millenarian process. The Left Behind series has sold 17m copies in the US over the past five years, only about 3m fewer than the total American sales of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series, which have commanded the charts on both sides of the Atlantic for most of the past year. The Indwelling has already sold 1.9m copies and the specialist Christian publishers, Tyndale House, has had to built new warehouses at its printworks in Illinois to cope with demand. The success of the new book is all the more remarkable because many publishers and trade specialists had assumed that the success of the earlier novels in the series had been part of conservative America's mounting excitement over the approach of the millennium, when some enthusiasts believed that the world would end and the kingdom of Christ - US style - would be ushered in. Yet the anticlimax of the start of the new millennium has done nothing to dampen enthusiasm for the series. In interviews, Mr LaHaye appears to be the more driven member of the successful duo, saying that the books' message \"is the greatest message of hope in the world\". Mr Jenkins, by contrast, seems more worldly. \"There are some times when I think I was born for this project,\" he said recently. \"Other times I think I was born to play golf.\"",

The recognition has come slightly late for her. Yet her voice is unmistakably modern: direct, impassioned and unstaunchably erotic as she tries to talk her lover into bed:</p> <p>Let each of us be bound with a tight bond</p> <p>No future day shall break. The young man wishes</p> <p>The same things I do, but doesn't want to</p> <p>Blurt it out too openly.</p> <p>And she berates her uncle Messala for coming between them.</p> <p>Messala is much better known than his niece. GCSE students will recognise him as the character in Julius Caesar who tells Brutus of Cassius's death.</p> <p>Even in Shakespeare's time, he was antique. He fought at the battle of Philippi in 42BC, surviving to become a literary patron in the reign of the emperor Augustus.</p> <p>Sulpicia's poems have lain almost hidden to a general readership for more than 2,000 years.

      "bodyText": "A virtually undiscovered poet, her work long buried among a man's less talented verses, will next month make her debut in English letters in her own right. Take a bow, Sulpicia. The recognition has come slightly late for her. Yet her voice is unmistakably modern: direct, impassioned and unstaunchably erotic as she tries to talk her lover into bed: Let each of us be bound with a tight bond No future day shall break. The young man wishes The same things I do, but doesn't want to Blurt it out too openly. And she berates her uncle Messala for coming between them. Messala is much better known than his niece. GCSE students will recognise him as the character in Julius Caesar who tells Brutus of Cassius's death. Even in Shakespeare's time, he was antique. He fought at the battle of Philippi in 42BC, surviving to become a literary patron in the reign of the emperor Augustus. Sulpicia's poems have lain almost hidden to a general readership for more than 2,000 years. Now they are to be published together, for the first time in Britain, as the only works by a woman to have survived from all the literature of ancient Rome. She was born before Jesus Christ, in the same generation and private literary circle as male poets Ovid, Catullus, Horace whose names lived down the ages. No known image or biography of her exists. All we have is her father's first name, Servius. She is known only through eight love elegies incorporated, without definite attribution, in four volumes left by a male elegiac poet from her circle, Tibullus. Six poems are now regarded as hers and two more as possibles. The 19th century German and English scholars who established the texts of classical literature \"thought Tibullus wrote them for her\", John Heath-Stubbs, the English classical poet who has done the new translation, said yesterday. \"They knew little, one feels, about women. They were reluctant to believe that any woman could - or should - write poems as passionately outspoken as these are,\" he said. \"They would have preferred her to be cosy like Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\" These were the years, Heath-Stubbs added, in which inhibited dons insisted the Greek lesbian poet Sappho \"was simply the headmistress of a select finishing school for well-connected young ladies on the isle of Lesbos\". Even so, the 19th century German scholar CG Heyne called Sulpicia's fragments within the Tibullus \"a marvel - the most beautiful relic of the whole of Latinity\". Another, Emil Bahrens, noted the difference in style from Tibullus, concluding the sections \"could only have been written by a poet of the first rank\". Tibullus's reputation waned, with only two British translations of his work in the 20th century. But Sulpicia's star has begun to rise, with most scholars and classical societies accepting that her poems are separate and distinctive. \"It's wonderful stuff,\" Denis Feeney, tutor in classical language and literature at New College, Oxford, said yesterday. \"People are always very surprised and knocked back to find that there is somebody writing as she does, although she still gets scooped into modern editions of Tibullus.

Although the retired judge, Gerald Butler, who carried out the inquiry, said that almost everybody involved had some input into what went wrong, his recommendations made clear that the judge who threw out the case against both men had been mistaken. His report cleared the customs officers involved of accusations that they acted illegally in their undercover bugging operations, faked evidence or lied under oath in court. But the report, published yesterday, identified incompetence in the customs prosecution, and said the official authority for their bugging operations were based on \"hopelessly defective documentation\" and that the records on all their bugging operations at the time were chaotic. The collapse of the case left the taxpayer with a \u00a350m bill. Brian Doran, a Glasgwegian with a degree in Latin American studies, known as \"the professor\" and his lieutenant, Kenneth Togher, were cleared of smuggling \u00a334m worth of cocaine into Britain. At the time of their arrest in 1995, customs hailed their spectacular raid on the yacht, The Frugal, at Pevensey Bay, East Sussex, as part of Operation Stealer, as \"the best knock ever\". The two ringleaders were jailed for 24 years each. But the case turned sour when the appeal court judge, Mr Justice Turner, threw it out on the grounds that the prosecution had wrongly withheld the information that the suspects' hotel rooms had been bugged without official authority. Two customs cocaine target teams spent two years in their most expensive undercover operation to set up the arrests, which ended in the seizure of 309kg of cocaine hidden in six containers on the Sussex beach. Their work inspired the ITV drama series, The Knock. The report said there was now a case that the customs should lose its power to prosecute such cases in the courts; that the only judges who should be allowed to try such complex drugs cases should be from a \"selected pool\" as with serious fraud cases; and that the prosecution should be given the right of appeal against a judge throwing out such an \"abuse of process\" case in future. \"A lot of people are to blame.

Zarko Rakcevic, who leads the opposition Social Democratic party, told the Guardian: \"We cannot accept Montenegro being an instrument of western pressure on Milosevic. \"As long as you have Montenegro in the federation, the idea of [a] 'Greater Serbia' survives. Without Montenegro, they must start on the road of de-Nazification.\"",

If the Rwanda genocide were to happen tomorrow, Gen Clark was unsure whether the outside world would react any differently.</p> <p>He is wearing a business suit as he does the rounds of Wall Street investment houses and hi-tech venture capital firms. Meanwhile he is putting the Clark doctrine in a book.

Despite his early departure the Clark doctrine of decisive force is at least gaining lip service in the corridors of the Pentagon, but the fear of casualties is likely to remain a paralysing influence when the bullets begin to fly. The principle of humanitarian intervention is also in limbo. A victory for George W Bush in November is likely to send it back into retreat. If the Rwanda genocide were to happen tomorrow, Gen Clark was unsure whether the outside world would react any differently. He is wearing a business suit as he does the rounds of Wall Street investment houses and hi-tech venture capital firms. Meanwhile he is putting the Clark doctrine in a book. The lessons of Kosovo are still being learned. \"It's a profound change,\" Gen Clark said. \"It's akin to throwing a pebble in a pond and the ripples from that stone will go on for some time.\"",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, is to undertake a dramatic volte face over fox hunting by announcing on Monday that the government will table its own bill, with a number of options including an outright ban on hunting with hounds. The plan was agreed in outline at yesterday's cabinet meeting, in advance of ministers today formally receiving a copy of the offical Burns inquiry into the impact of fox hunting on the countryside. The decision to table a government bill increases its chance of reaching the statute book - or, at least, the chance of a morale boosting confrontation with the partially-reformed Lords in the next session, likely to be the last before the general election. Mr Straw will make a statement to MPs on Monday. His aides have told MPs closely involved in the issue that he will suggest that a bill is tabled early in the next session with MPs given a free vote. The bill, says the aides, will be passed overwhelmingly in the Commons, and then face fierce resistance in the Lords. Ministers will stress that if the bill is rejected in the Lords, they will make it a manifesto commitment for the next general election. Until recent weeks Mr Straw has been holding out against a government bill, preferring to give government time to a private member's bill or simply delaying the measure altogether until after the election. Ministers now expect the fox hunting inquiry, chaired by the former treasury permanent secretary Lords Burns, to make it clear that a ban on fox hunting will not destroy the rural economy, except in parts of south-west England. Nor would a ban lead to a massive surge in the fox population, it will say. The inquiry's official research shows that fox hunting is one of the least efficient ways of reducing the fox population. The report will, however, concede that fox hunting is popular in the countryside and plays a special cultural role. Mr Straw's change of tack also reflects the increasing pressure from Labour backbenchers to stick by the manifesto commitment to provide time to ban fox hunting. As many as 102 backbenchers were planning to support a rebellion if Mr Straw did not make a clear commitment to a government bill. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy yesterday expressed scepticism about a government move, saying: \"I don't think at the top of government they want to re-open this particular issue, if they can possibly avoid it, despite what the prime minister said a few months back.\"",

Although the bulk of the British force is leaving soon, we are undoubtedly morally committed to return if the war should again go badly for the government and the United Nations proves unable to cope.</p> <p>As Robin Cook enjoys the plaudits of the people of Freetown, it is worth reflecting both on the almost accidental way in which this commitment emerged, and on how fragile are the political forces with which we are now allied. The Sierra Leone operation was a product of the restructured British military readiness system (of which it has been the first serious test), of luck and of judicious opportunism.</p> <p>The system efficiently delivered the rapid reaction force it was designed to produce. The luck came in the timing, in the chance that an amphibious force was at hand in the Mediterranean, and in the fact that the British were already involved in advising the Sierra Leone military. The opportunism came when those in charge of what began as an evacuation realised that the war in Sierra Leone was such a flimsy and chaotic affair that it could probably be turned around by a mixture of exhortation, forceful advice, and showmanship.</p> <p>The chutzpah of our military men has been rather amazing. But what can be turned once can be turned again. That means not only that British forces might have to return to Sierra Leone, but that British diplomacy has new and difficult tasks. Britain is now involved far more than it was before in the complex and dangerous regional politics of west Africa, and in a problem that almost certainly cannot be solved until Charles Taylor, the ruler of neighbouring Liberia, is overthrown. It is not only Sierra Leone that is threatened. The potentially lethal combination of bad or inadequate government, disappointed rural people, and valuable resources for the taking exists in other countries in the region. A diamond boycott, if properly managed - which is a big if - will help, but there will have to be more to policy than that.</p> <p>The grave weakness of Sierra Leone can hardly be overestimated. The country has just one month's supply of rice and fuel. Most of its meagre income comes from donors. Rice-planting has been disrupted by the resumed hostilities, which means worse scarcity is ahead. Refugees are once again heading in large numbers for Freetown and other centres. But the more fundamental difficulty is that the institutional infrastructure of Sierra Leone was fecklessly destroyed long before any rebels came on the scene. Earlier leaders, above all Siaka Stevens, who ruled from 1968 to 1985, eviscerated the country's institu tions, from the civil service and the judiciary to the army. The middle class either colluded or went abroad in disgust. In this \"shadow state\", as one academic has called it, real power was exercised, the real deals were struck, and the real money was made outside of the formal institutions, which became mere shades of what they had been. Expertise was dissipated, professional standards dropped. When the foreign ministry, for example, was recently asked for copies of treaties to which Sierra Leone is party, it discovered it had lost them.</p> <p>The incompetence and lack of control of the Sierra Leonean state after Stevens had finished with it is the main reason it fell victim to an extraordinary act of international larceny. Charles Taylor, in alliance with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), simply seized Sierra Leone's diamonds to finance his struggle to dominate Liberia. Taylor's capacity to manipulate the war has been amply demonstrated in the past month, during which he has restrained RUF units in the east of the country and been instrumental in the release of UN hostages. But since his aim is to continue to control the diamond areas by proxy, he will choose aggressive or \"peaceable\" tactics according to need.</p> <p>The government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is an uneasy coalition of academics and professionals shackled with militia leaders and former coup-makers. Kabbah is reasonably popular but not a commanding figure, and his popularity rests in part on his capacity to deliver foreign military and financial help. The forces the government has - it would be too much to say it controls them - are a congery of half-trained new soldiers and irregulars, including ex-rebels and some who were little more than bandits before they rallied to the cause. The British military claim they are getting better and that British training will effect further improvements. But that is from a very low base indeed.</p> <p>The weakness of the government is paralleled by the weakness of the UN force which has unavoidably become the government's not very stable prop since fighting began again last month. The force is hampered not so much by its mandate as by the reluctance of its contingents to obey orders. In spite of the fact that the UN mission is headed by a Nigerian diplomat and the deputy commander of the force is also Nigerian, one of the Nigerian battalions, for example, refused orders to reoccupy a strategic junction last week. Apart from such problems, the force remains vulnerable to hostage-taking.</p> <p>It is true that Sierra Leone displays a sort of competition in fragility. If the government barely has a grip, the UN is tentative, and the British are trying to make a difference with a riskily small outlay of resources, the RUF is not by international standards a formidable force. It may have no more than a couple of thousand fighters; its government of the regions it controls is both harsh and ineffective; and its ideological appeal has faded. To deny that it has any social base would be foolish, and it may still focus feelings of hostility toward Freetown, toward southern ethnic groups, and against Nigeria. But a living popular revolutionary movement it is not. Yet the question in Sierra Leone is not who is strong - nobody is - but who is least weak.</p> <p>The Sierra Leone government lost its diamonds and much of its country because it was enfeebled and in the process it became more enfeebled still. It will be hard for it to defeat the RUF in any final way, or to prevail politically in the kind of neither-peace-nor-war situation which may come about if a ceasefire is patched up between the two sides, unless the problem represented by Charles Taylor can be solved. Siaka Stevens brought Sierra Leone down, and Charles Taylor keeps it down.

As they sit down to their coffee and biscuits at the Royal Moathouse hotel in Nottingham they look the epitome of middle class, middle-aged middle England.</p> <p>They are, they admit, all a certain age, conservative with a small 'c' with a strong urge to sing Jerusalem at least once a month. Two of the five are Tory voters, one a Liberal Democrat, and two won't say. But none, they insist, has ever made jam.</p> <p>The WI, as a registered charity, does not describe itself as a political organisation, seeing itself more as \"a modern voice for women\".</p> <p>Downing Street was yesterday privately angry at such a claim, pointing out that the WI repeatedly lobbies government and openly espouses its views in clear political terms. Among the issues it has taken up are post office closures, nursery school provision, breast cancer screening and GM foods.</p> <p>Ministers do not want to engage in an open war of words with the WI partly because there are few political benefits from doing so, but one minister said: \"We are lobbied by the WI up to 30 times a year. They produce papers on how to lobby MPs and MEPs, how to deal with lobbying organisations, how parliament works and it has even in the past adopted a position on the future of the House of Lords.\"</p> <p>At the time of the Budget, the WI issued lengthy press releases, dishing out praise and blame in equal measure over the chancellor's tax plans. It welcomed \"the extra help, although limited, for mothers and working families on low incomes, for pensioners and for small businesses\".

      "bodyText": "It is not often that the ladies of the women's institute at Watnall, on the outskirts of Nottingham, give themselves a pat on the back but yesterday they looked decidedly pleased with themselves. After all, the mild-mannered matrons of Britain's largest women's organisation found themselves on the front page of every national newspaper for humiliating the prime minister. Joan, Joy, Sheila, Margaret and Mollie are delighted by the stand made by their fellow members. As they sit down to their coffee and biscuits at the Royal Moathouse hotel in Nottingham they look the epitome of middle class, middle-aged middle England. They are, they admit, all a certain age, conservative with a small 'c' with a strong urge to sing Jerusalem at least once a month. Two of the five are Tory voters, one a Liberal Democrat, and two won't say. But none, they insist, has ever made jam. The WI, as a registered charity, does not describe itself as a political organisation, seeing itself more as \"a modern voice for women\". Downing Street was yesterday privately angry at such a claim, pointing out that the WI repeatedly lobbies government and openly espouses its views in clear political terms. Among the issues it has taken up are post office closures, nursery school provision, breast cancer screening and GM foods. Ministers do not want to engage in an open war of words with the WI partly because there are few political benefits from doing so, but one minister said: \"We are lobbied by the WI up to 30 times a year. They produce papers on how to lobby MPs and MEPs, how to deal with lobbying organisations, how parliament works and it has even in the past adopted a position on the future of the House of Lords.\" At the time of the Budget, the WI issued lengthy press releases, dishing out praise and blame in equal measure over the chancellor's tax plans. It welcomed \"the extra help, although limited, for mothers and working families on low incomes, for pensioners and for small businesses\". It also welcomed an increase in child benefit and a commitment to tackle child poverty and expressed concern over rural transport the government's road safety strategy, the lack of action on the crisis in farming and the high value of the pound. Tessa Jowell, the women's minister forging a relationship between Labour and the WI, said: \"I have spoken to lots of WIs and they have been highly involved in our 'listen to women' road shows. It is a very important organisation and one that the government needs to take seriously.\" The WI was set up in 1915 to help women in rural areas to support the war effort by bottling fruit and vegetables. Today, 85 years later, it has 250,000 members 8,000 institutes from villages, small towns and suburban districts. Watnall WI - 56 members - has been vocal in support of the village's post office. Tony Blair should leave them alone, said member Margaret Smith, 68, a retired teacher who votes Tory. But it was not a party political matter, insisted Mollie Houlton, 69, a retired teacher and Lib Dem supporter. \"We'd be arguing against whichever government was in power.\"",

      "bodyText": "Lord Rogers of Riverside is poised to test his architectural talents in a new arena by joining Ken Livingstone's mayoral cabinet and getting the \"power of the people\" behind a regeneration of London comparable to that of Barcelona. Asked whether the newly elected London mayor will have the power or the cash to make much difference, the designer of some of the world's most famous modernist buildings - as well as the Millennium Dome - said: \"I don't know yet, we've got to explore it.\" He added: \"But the mayor's got a big responsibility for the environment and traffic. The power here is not the written power, it's the power of the people behind you.\" Last night he called it a fantastic opportunity and said that his twin objectives in such a post would be the redevelopment of the Thames, as \"a connector, not a divider\", and the creation of neighbourhood squares. Long a champion of revitalising the Thames, he called the South Bank, from London Bridge to the London Eye, and the prospects for redevelopment of east London's Thames gateway \"the most important, accessible regeneration in urban England.\" It could be transformed as Barcelona's old harbour had been, with his help, to become what he called the leading example of such redevelopment. Lord Rogers has yet to make up his mind whether, at 66, he would accept Mr Livingstone's offer to join his team and manage the built environment programme in a capital which he has warned is \"rotting\". If he says yes within the next seven days Lord Rogers may need to create up to 1m new homes, mainly on existing \"brownfield\" sites, using his long-advocated mixed communities, where people \"live, work and have leisure within walking distance\". After news that Mr Livingstone had approached him two weeks ago leaked yesterday - and \"caught me on the hop\" - Lord Rogers admitted that he barely knew the former GLC leader, with whom he has had two working meetings. Nikki Gavron, Mr Livingstone's deputy, a veteran of London environmental politics, had brought them together, he said. \"Nikki was the facilitator, she has a very good understanding of urban questions.\" Lord Rogers, who is close to ministers, chairs the government's urban taskforce, working closely with John Prescott, whom he yesterday described as \"an amazing man, who has a hell of a battle, mostly outside his department\". Despite recent complaints, in which he urged ministers to move further and faster on urban regeneration, Lord Rogers insisted that he had not fallen out with Tony Blair, and that his willingness to work with Mr Livingstone was not a sign of disaffection. He has criticised the con tents of the dome - \"There are many good things, but it could be better\" - and, like Mr Livingstone, is keen to curb cars in the city. But one point of contention with the mayor is over his old partner, Lord (Norman) Foster's plan for a new riverside home for the greater London authority, a glass \"headlamp\" on the south bank of the Thames. \"It's an amazing design by one of the world's great architects, a great symbol of pride,\" he said. \"Why should the GLA move into a 100-year-old building?\" he asked. In his 1995 Reith lecture, Lord Rogers declared: \"London must not be abandoned to the mercy of the market - to cars, pollution and poverty. London offers every opportunity to create a cultured, balanced and sustainable city. But to achieve this Londoners must be empowered\" - by getting an elected mayor.",

Instead, it sees supply-side reforms and a good solid dose of market liberalisation as the way forward.

This gives the markets a bigger role in dictating monetary policy. </p> <p>But the fear must be that the bank is still fighting the last war. Inflation is low around the world, and the experience of the anglo-saxon economies in the past decade is that a sustained period of strong demand is crucial not just to bringing down unemployment but to smoothing the passage of economic reform. By moving rates upwards too early, the ECB risks choking off the recovery. And if that happens, the euro will go down not up.</p>",

Of course euroland still has a massive overhang of unemployment - the baleful legacy of two decades of deflationary economic policies. In essence, the ECB believes that much of this unemployment is structural and will not disappear even with strong growth. Instead, it sees supply-side reforms and a good solid dose of market liberalisation as the way forward. The bank has certainly put its money where its mouth is by moving from a fixed-rate refinancing system for a more variable-rate regime. This gives the markets a bigger role in dictating monetary policy. But the fear must be that the bank is still fighting the last war. Inflation is low around the world, and the experience of the anglo-saxon economies in the past decade is that a sustained period of strong demand is crucial not just to bringing down unemployment but to smoothing the passage of economic reform. By moving rates upwards too early, the ECB risks choking off the recovery. And if that happens, the euro will go down not up.",

      "bodyText": "The world Aids epidemic began in Africa with the accidental infection of a human from a chimpanzee between 1915 and 1941, a US-based scientific team has claimed. The claim, made in the latest issue of the journal Science, adds to the growing controversy over the origin of Aids, reignited by British journalist Ed Hooper in his book The River. Mr Hooper argued that HIV-1, the main virus causing Aids, was first introduced accidentally into humans in the then Belgian Congo in the 1950s, as the result of trials of an experimental polio vaccine. But the US researchers, led by Bette Korber of the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, said that HIV-1 must have appeared before the vaccine trials. The battle lines are now drawn before a showdown in London in September, when proponents of the conflicting theories will air their views at a Royal Society conference. The Korber group used computers to analyse the recent rate of mutation of the most pernicious strain of HIV, HIV-1 M, which has infected 50m people and left 16m dead. Working on the assumption that the original virus mutated into different versions at a steady rate over time, they tracked its first appearance in humans back to a point earlier than 1941 and later than 1915, most likely in 1931. The experimental polio vaccine was given to hundreds of thousands of people in Central Africa between 1957 and 1960. It is generally accepted that the first known case of HIV infection, retrospectively diagnosed, was from 1959, in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa \"Our analyses suggest that the HIV-1 M group ancestral sequence occurred decades before the vaccination programmes,\" said the group's Science paper. \"We find it unlikely that oral polio vaccine was the source of HIV-1 transmission to humans.\" The Hooper scenario proposes that western scientists used the kidneys of chimpanzees, known to have been kept at a lab close to the city of Kisangani, to prepare the experimental vaccine, known as CHAT. According to this theory, the kidneys contained a simian version of the HIV virus, SIV, which passed into some of those vaccinated. Cases of other viruses spreading via other polio vaccines are well documented. Surviving members of the CHAT research team have said other primate kidneys, not organs from chimps, were used, but no paper evidence exists to say what exactly was done with the Kisangani chimps. The Korber team acknowledged that they had not disproved the Hooper scenario, but said that to make their calculations wrong, the CHAT vaccine would have to have introduced nine genetically distinct versions of the HIV-1 virus into humans. Mr Hooper said yesterday that he believed this was what had happened. He pointed out that one key reference in the Korber paper, to one of the few surviving lab records from Kisangani, wrongly stated that the lab held only juvenile chimps, which would be less likely to harbour different types of SIV. In fact the document, which is now in Mr Hooper's hands and has been seen by the Guardian, records that at least one chimp was an adult. Dr Korber and Mr Hooper present a contrast in styles; the American scientist crunching numbers in a hi-tech lab; the journalist relying on expertise picked up from years of poring over scientific journals. \"Dr Korber's is an interesting theory, but doesn't cast any light on how Aids began,\" said Mr Hooper.",

      "bodyText": "A shadow cabinet plan to establish a new green agenda for the Tories by backing an all-party measure to cut pensioner deaths caused by fuel poverty is set be wrecked today by two Conservative ex-ministers, David Maclean and Eric Forth. The bill - put forward by David Amess, Conservative MP for Southend West, with backing of Tory environment spokesman Damian Green - would have committed the government to setting up a national strategy to combat fuel poverty. It was due to pass all its stages in the Commons today. But yesterday morning some 70 amendments were tabled by the two backbenchers without consulting Mr Amess, the shadow cabinet, or the Tory chief whip, James Arbuthnot. The Guardian revealed last month how Mr Maclean helped wreck a firework safety bill. In letters he had said that the blocking of that bill had been punishment for Labour's stance on hunting. The shadow cabinet is understood to be furious at the MPs' action. Three months ago Mr Green issued a press release saying: \"The new Conservative blue-green agenda means that we welcome the principles behind this bill because it will lead to a saving of energy. \"We also welcome it as a practical way of improving the lot of pensioners. A Conservative government would use private funding methods to meet the programme of improvements,\" he added. Last night Mr Forth said: \"The bill as it stands is all motherhood and apple pie and will raise false expectations because there is no money attached to it. In our view it was emasculated when it had a second reading in the Commons - and a lot of specific provisions were taken out.\" When it was put to him that it was Tory party policy to support it and find the money from private sources, he retorted: \"You don't need a bill to do that.\" He also criticised Mr Green for sticking to his support for the measure after it had been changed. He dismissed criticism from Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, who claimed that 230 pensioners had died unnecessarily from badly heated homes, as \"meaningless\". Mr Forth said the figures were out of date and failed to take into account the excellent social services provision and the recent cuts in fuel prices. The two MPs' decision to effectively wreck the bill, which will run out of time today, was also condemned yesterday by Friends of the Earth, Help the Aged and Age Concern. Mike Lake, director general of Help the Aged, said: \"This bill is desperately needed to prevent thousands of people dying unnecessarily each year.\"",

      "bodyText": "A former soldier wrongly convicted at 17 of the murder of a schoolgirl was yesterday awarded \u00a3750,000 by the Home Office, bringing his total compensation to almost \u00a31m. Andrew Evans spent 25 years in jail for the murder of 14-year-old Judith Roberts before being freed by appeal court judges in 1997, the longest period served by a wrongly convicted person. In the absence of scientific or eyewitness evidence, he was convicted through answers obtained using a so-called truth drug, brietal, which has since been discredited for inducing false memories. Under today's rules of evidence, his confession would have been inadmissible, and there were also doubts raised about psychiatric evidence. Yesterday's award will add up to almost \u00a31m with interim payments, and is thought to be a record. The highest award known to have been offered in such a case is \u00a3550,000 to Gerry Hunter, who spent more than 16 years in prison over the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. The group dubbed the Birmingham Six had previously rejected an offer of \u00a3400,000 each. Mr Evans, now 45, said that yesterday marked the last day of his false imprisonment and the first day of his life. \"For the past two and a half years we have been fighting for this money and at last it has been sorted. I am relieved. \"I will never be fully free - every time I lock a door I have flashbacks to being in prison.\" His solicitor, Dragan Plavsic, said: \"With interim payments, Mr Evans's award is closer to \u00a31m. I believe it may be the largest award of its type ever given because he is probably the person who has been locked away for the longest time. \"I think this was a reasonable settlement - the whole point is to try to repay the horror he has been through for the last 25 years.\" Mr Evans was a soldier serving at Whittington barracks just outside Lichfield in June 1972 when the girl's body was found in a field six miles away. The nervous and socially in adequate teenager, who was taking a prescription drug for depression, went to see police in October that year because he had dreamed of a girl's face. Sobbing hysterically, he stumbled into a police station and asked to see a photograph of Judith Roberts. Detectives initially dismissed him as a fantasist but over three days of questioning, began to accept his belief that he was the killer. When officers asked him if he had murdered Judith, he said: \"This is it - I don't know. Show me a picture and I will tell you if I've seen her.\" Police said he recalled details that could have been known only by Judith's killer. As the trial approached, he retracted his confession and lawyers on both sides agreed the use of a truth drug. He was sentenced to life in 1973. In 1994 Mr Evans began a campaign to prove his innocence and contacted the human rights group Justice. Mr Evans, who now lives in Nottingham and last month married Sue, 43, said: \"I have lost most of my life. Now I have married and we are going to buy a house and settle down properly.\" A spokeswoman for Justice said: \"We are delighted to hear he has won his compensation battle.\" A Home Office spokesman confirmed the payout had been made, but refused to comment on the amount.",

A Mori poll of voting intentions conducted for the Fawcett Society indicates a Tory lead of 18 points over Labour among middle class women over 55. The findings, conducted in the first quarter of this year and the most up-to-date available, compare with a 14% lead for the Conservatives among women in the higher social classes in 1998. The figures also coincide with new research showing that women's level of satisfaction with the government has fallen far further than men's, leaving a gap of 13 points. The slippage will be particularly worrying for Labour because older women are the most likely to turn out at the polling booths. It will be small comfort to the party's strategists that the Fawcett research shows a 30-point lead for Labour among ABC1 women under 25, since the young are the most reluctant voters. The sense that WI woman is losing faith in New Labour is doubly galling for the party since it has continued to suggest that the closing of the gender gap it achieved - with some effort - at the last election has remained since it took office. In 1997, Labour managed to whittle the \"gender gap\" - the difference between its support from men and from women - down to just 2% from as wide as 12% in the 1980s, when women became most disillusioned with the party. That gap, which is small enough to be negligible in polling terms, remains the same overall. Fawcett Society director Mary-Ann Stephenson called the slump in older women's support \"extremely significant\". She said: \"There has been as assumption that it is middle England voters turning against Tony Blair, when it is actually about women. Labour has a real problem with women over 55.\" Many older women were concerned about pension provision and believed people were being penalised for saving, she suggested. \"These women were wooed and, having been won, they are feeling a bit ignored. \"All the parties have to remember that women are much more likely to switch their support than men are.

      "bodyText": "Scientists investigating a spate of deaths among drug addicts across Britain and Ireland believe at least 30 fatalities may be linked to a rogue batch of heroin infected with a bacterium found in soil. Intensive analysis in Britain and the United States has connected the deaths of 15 addicts in Glasgow, one in Aberdeen, eight in Dublin and at least seven in England and Wales to a toxin produced by a bacterium which may have been inadvertently mixed with the opiate. As health authorities complete their investigations of heroin-related deaths over the past month, the number of cases where heroin users have exhibited similar symptoms is rising dramatically. Yesterday health authorities in the north-west confirmed nine cases in Manchester and Liverpool, involving five deaths. Many more heroin addicts across Britain and Ireland are seriously ill with the condition, which could claim the greatest number of deaths in Britain caused by a rogue narcotic. The outbreak was first identified in early May when heroin addicts in Glasgow began turning up at hospital casualty departments with huge abscesses up to 12 inches in diameter. The addicts, mainly women, were given antibiotics, but developed an illness similar to septicaemia. Many suffered multiple organ failure and died. When the spate of heroin deaths was first spotted in Glasgow public health officials, led by Laurence Gruer, began a nationwide search for the cause. Dr Gruer, a senior public health consultant with Greater Glasgow health board, called on the help of specialists from the centres for disease control and prevention in Atlanta. British and American scientists now agree the deaths have been caused by a bacterium found in soil never before associated with the deaths of drug addicts. All those affected have been intravenous heroin users, but it is women, more than men, who have been dying. Scientists believe this is because women, who have a larger fat covering on their body, are more likely to miss veins and inject directly into their muscles, where scientists believe the bacterium thrives in the acid used to dissolve the heroin. The bacterium would quickly be diluted by blood if injected in the veins. Doctors can give antibiotics to kill the bacterium, but have no way of tackling the toxin. This explains why so many addicts have died despite receiving hospital treatment. Initially the anthrax bacterium used in chemical weapons was suspected as a possible cause following a tip-off from a Norwegian doctor and tests carried out at the Porton Down laboratory, Wiltshire, which confirmed blood samples from two Scottish victims contained antibodies to anthrax. However the tests were inconclusive and anthrax was ruled out. Public health officials across the country yesterday reiterated their plea to heroin addicts to stop injecting the drug and begin smoking it. But, since smoking heroin is far less effective and much more expensive than injecting, it is likely their pleas will fall on deaf ears.

The group is paying \u00a3274m for the outstanding 36.7% of Amylum and 10% of Staley, both owned by CIP, a private investment company based in Luxembourg. The cash and shares deal will leave CIP owning 5% of Tate &amp; Lyle. Amylum, one of Europe's leading producers of cereal sweeteners and starch, operates mainly in France, Belgium, Britain, Spain, Holland, Italy and Greece. Tate &amp; Lyle bought a third of the business in 1976 and effectively doubled its holding when it took control of Staley in 1988. The British group has also agreed to sell Tate &amp; Lyle Bundaberg, its wholly owned Australian sugar business. Mr Pillard said Bundaberg had been bought in 1991 in the expectation that deregulation of the Queensland sugar industry would enable it to be integrated into other group operations. However recently introduced legislation meant that it was unlikely that enhanced returns from vertical integration would be available in the near future, he said. With overall market conditions unlikely to improve, Tate &amp; Lyle is relying on improved efficiency and reduction in costs to boost profits. Investors, however, remain unconvinced. The shares closed unchanged at 268p.",

      "body": "<p>A controversial plan to use Russia, a country struggling to cope with the consequences of its ageing nuclear arsenal, as a storage depot for 10,000 tonnes of the globe's spent nuclear fuel is being actively developed in Washington and Moscow.</p> <p>Five countries - Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands and Switzerland - have expressed interest in sending the fuel to Russia to be placed in specially constructed stores where it would be kept safe and prevented from being used for nuclear weapons.</p> <p>As part of the deal, the Russians would agree to halt plans to commercially reprocess spent fuel, assuring that it would make no more plutonium available for nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Minatom, the Russian nuclear power agency, suggested in April a 20-year moratorium on reprocessing in exchange for the US helping Russia to build a dry store. Russia has the expertise to deal with spent fuel, but it has no money to build the storage facility.</p> <p>The plan would generate an estimated $15bn (\u00a310bn) in fees during the first 10 years. This foreign exchange would provide the funding to build enough space for the 10,000 tonnes of fuel and solve the problem of what to do with Russia's increasing stockpile of fuel from reactors - believed already to be 14,000 tonnes.</p> <p>The idea has influential backers in the US and Russia, including endorsement from senior environmental figures such as Tom Cochran, the director of nuclear programmes at the National Resources Defence Council (NRDC), but some green groups are appalled by the idea.</p> <p>\"The world has huge problems with nuclear waste but sending it to Russia is not the answer,\" Michael Mariotte, the executive director of the Nuclear Information Resource Service, said. \"The plan really represents the ultimate in 'not in my back yard' thinking.\"</p> <p>Vladimir Slivyak, of Russia's Ecodefence, an umbrella group of 300 environmental organisations, said: \"We are shocked by the proposals which have nothing in common with environmental principles and unethically promote the interests of western nuclear industry, whose main concern is to get rid of its nuclear waste.\"</p> <p>Mr Slivyak said Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's minister for nuclear power, has included the building of 23 nuclear reactors in Russia as part of the programme.</p> <p>\"These reactors are dangerous and not needed. Energy-efficient technologies do not exist on an industrial scale in Russia,\" Mr Slivyak said. \"Development of renewable sources of energy would provide Russia with a great amount of energy as well. But efficiency and renewables do not have great lobbyists as one of the richest corporations of the world - Minatom - has.\"</p> <p>Still, the NRDC's Dr Cochran remains squarely behind the initiative. \"It would stop reprocessing in Russia for at least a couple of decades; it would aid nuclear non-proliferation by removing fuel from countries like Taiwan. It would also solve storage problems for countries in earthquake zones. The income stream [it would create] could cure a lot of problems in Russia.\"</p> <p>He said the five countries had expressed an interest in the scheme because it would solve their problems on what to do with spent nuclear fuel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A controversial plan to use Russia, a country struggling to cope with the consequences of its ageing nuclear arsenal, as a storage depot for 10,000 tonnes of the globe's spent nuclear fuel is being actively developed in Washington and Moscow. Five countries - Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands and Switzerland - have expressed interest in sending the fuel to Russia to be placed in specially constructed stores where it would be kept safe and prevented from being used for nuclear weapons. As part of the deal, the Russians would agree to halt plans to commercially reprocess spent fuel, assuring that it would make no more plutonium available for nuclear weapons. Minatom, the Russian nuclear power agency, suggested in April a 20-year moratorium on reprocessing in exchange for the US helping Russia to build a dry store. Russia has the expertise to deal with spent fuel, but it has no money to build the storage facility. The plan would generate an estimated $15bn (\u00a310bn) in fees during the first 10 years. This foreign exchange would provide the funding to build enough space for the 10,000 tonnes of fuel and solve the problem of what to do with Russia's increasing stockpile of fuel from reactors - believed already to be 14,000 tonnes. The idea has influential backers in the US and Russia, including endorsement from senior environmental figures such as Tom Cochran, the director of nuclear programmes at the National Resources Defence Council (NRDC), but some green groups are appalled by the idea. \"The world has huge problems with nuclear waste but sending it to Russia is not the answer,\" Michael Mariotte, the executive director of the Nuclear Information Resource Service, said. \"The plan really represents the ultimate in 'not in my back yard' thinking.\" Vladimir Slivyak, of Russia's Ecodefence, an umbrella group of 300 environmental organisations, said: \"We are shocked by the proposals which have nothing in common with environmental principles and unethically promote the interests of western nuclear industry, whose main concern is to get rid of its nuclear waste.\" Mr Slivyak said Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's minister for nuclear power, has included the building of 23 nuclear reactors in Russia as part of the programme. \"These reactors are dangerous and not needed. Energy-efficient technologies do not exist on an industrial scale in Russia,\" Mr Slivyak said. \"Development of renewable sources of energy would provide Russia with a great amount of energy as well. But efficiency and renewables do not have great lobbyists as one of the richest corporations of the world - Minatom - has.\" Still, the NRDC's Dr Cochran remains squarely behind the initiative. \"It would stop reprocessing in Russia for at least a couple of decades; it would aid nuclear non-proliferation by removing fuel from countries like Taiwan. It would also solve storage problems for countries in earthquake zones. The income stream [it would create] could cure a lot of problems in Russia.\" He said the five countries had expressed an interest in the scheme because it would solve their problems on what to do with spent nuclear fuel.",

Ceaseless in its quest for relevance, the church is planning to point up the Christian message lurking behind the stories of the little Japanese cartoon characters. Anne Richards, theology secretary of the church's Board of Mission - responsible for spreading the gospel in the community - has written a paper extolling the morality of the likes of Ash and Mewtwo, characters from the recent Pokemon film which was panned by critics and is now being endured by parents nationwide. \"I had to ask myself whether this obsession with Pokemon could be used to speak into any of the stories and narratives the church holds dear,\" she explains. \"At first I found this very difficult, since so much of Pokemon is concerned with fighting battles and outwitting opponents, but I have changed my mind after having seen the movie.\" Now, where parents may see only a craze for buying and swapping cards showing the 150 varieties of pocket monsters which appear to exist only to kill each other, Dr Richards discerns a tale of Christian sacrifice and redemption. Relating the film's tale of the wicked Mewtwo, who seeks to capture all human beings and to clone Pokemons and set them to fight each other, Dr Richards detects a parable about the pointlessness of force and the importance of the love relationship.

There are many new-millennium women, enjoying a freedom they take for granted, who owe a debt to Joan Bourne and others like her. She is survived by her daughter. Ben Pimlott \u0095 Joan Augusta Bourne, political activist, born July 10 1909; died May 25 2000",

FACT: in 1984 she enjoys her first number one hit with Like A Virgin. FACT: within the space of a decade, she has become the key cultural icon of her time, a high-powered feminist intellectual capable of reinterpreting masculine sex-role fantasies in an ironic mode and thus empowering not only herself but all women into a complete reassessment of the feminist role from passive/submissive to active/dominant. FACT: in 1999, she wins a Grammy for best original song from a motion picture for her contribution to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, an iconic feminist movie that effectively re-examines and revolutionises the role of women in late 20th century on-screen entertainment. </p> <p>With keynote number one hits like I Wanna [Shake My Butt] (1987), Look At Me - I Wear [No Panties] (1991) and F-F-Fellatio! (1995), hugely successful concert tours such as the Bosoms Out For The Boys World Tour (1987) and her 1988 major autobiographical work of feminist iconography, Madonna In The Nude From Funny Angles, Madonna was to prove conclusively that the great post-war feminist battle had been won - and from now on it would be possible for young women wearing the barest minimum of clothes to make it big in the male-dominated world of entertainment. </p> <p>In Madonna, I see a woman in a continual state of development, both artistic and personal, a woman who has engaged in a lifetime study of the struggle between men and women; and has recently embarked on a far-reaching examination of fame and its effects. Her insights into fame are indeed extraordinary: she has taught us something about the meaning of fame that we would otherwise never have guessed - the sobering fact that to be famous means being well known to a very large number of people you may never have met. </p> <p>And having played almost every role imaginable - from sex-goddess to vamp to femme fatale to goddess-of-sex - she is now astonishing us afresh by turning her back on fame. Two years ago she issued that most intensely personal statement, Mama, I Don't Wanna Be Famous No More [Disco Mix] in which she appeared on satellite in her new role as sex-goddess in front of more than 500,000,000 people worldwide and sang - exquisitely, painfully - these heartfelt lyrics that were to signal a new beginning: </p> <p> \"Mama, I don't wanna be<br> famous no more </p> <p>So I'll take off all my </p> <p>clothes </p> <p>And lay my brassiere on </p> <p>the floor </p> <p>(Chorus) So let's do it right </p> <p>here, baby, Right here on my bed! </p> <p>Let's do it right here? </p> <p>Can't get you outta my </p> <p> head!\" <br></p> <p>With this statement, Madonna has become the Whole Woman.

This is not true. The Football (Offences &amp; Disorder) Act 1999 was a private members bill introduced by the Conservative MP Simon Burns. It allows passports to be removed from anyone made the subject of an international banning order by magistrates. Senior Labour backbenchers as well as Conservative members expressed reservations about extending restrictions to people without convictions for violence. Both government and opposition agreed that a private members bill was not the ideal vehicle. However, I made it clear the Conservative party would support such a measure in a government bill in government time. The home secretary has had a year in which to bring forward legislation.

As a keen member of the WI for many years, I was very proud of its campaigning history. Yesterday I was disgusted at its loutish behaviour. It would surely have been more telling and dignified to receive the speech in stony silence. Helen Keating Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkudbrightshire Were they hoping for a talk on caring for baby? Jean Machell Stockton-on-Tees It's a safe bet that any organisation which describes itself as \"apolitical\" is stuffed full of Tories. WI branches are often little more than the jam-making section of the local Conservative Association. A slow handclap and the odd heckles hould be viewed in contrast with the divisive politics of successive Conservative governments. I recall, inner-city riots, violent and costly industrial disputes and frequent protest marches. In common with many other lifelong Labour supporters, I have nagging doubts about the big tent-style of politics, but things should be kept in proportion. The government continues to be seen as both competent and popular and it will take more than a slow handclap from our natural opponents to derail the New Labour project. Andrew Furlong Kirkby Mallory, Leics afurlong@icheme.org.uk It is a sign of our strange times that a \"respectable\" women's organisation heckles and jeers a politician it has invited to address it and then it is the politician who is widely held to blame. But perhaps nothing has really changed and the WI, like the rest of Middle Britain, is what it always has been beneath the surface - intolerant, bad-mannered and provincial. Tim Shelton-Jones Brighton, E Sussex When the WI heckle and walk out they are respectable pillars of the middle class. When teachers do the same ... Mark Hellen London m.hellen@euroseek.com It is New Labour's mindset, seen in its unwillingness to respond positively and forcefully to Hague's racist rabble-rousing over asylum seekers that has led to Tony Blair's humiliation. New Labour must understand that speeches based on focus-group findings are insufficient, that they must refuse to be held hostage by the cheap populism of Hague, the Mail and the Sun, and that in the end a political leader must lead politically. Peter Nicklin Newcastle upon Tyne peter.nicklin@newcastle.ac.uk Mr Blair and his spinners got what they deserved. But didn't Downing Street realise there would be more Tory women at Wembley than at the Tory party conference? Joe Hennessy London Having watched, with great admiration, the Guardian's successful attempts to discredit the Tories and help to rid the country of their sleaze and incompetence, I am now bemused as to why you are doing your best to get them back in power again? I know many other readers are equally baffled by the almost incessant attack on the government, such as your headline on the WI, playing daily into the hands of Hague, Portillo and Widdecombe. The nightmare of a far rightwing Tory government is now a possibility; many of your readers would never forgive you should you play a part in that nightmare becoming a reality. Roger Hall Shrewsbury PlantPot21@aol.com Booed by the Women's Institute. I've ticked that off on my checklist for credibility with traditional Labour supporters. Still lots to go, but well done, Tony. Suggest the state pension's link to inflation next. Dan Lloyd Bristol Blair could have fared worse. What if the glam WI calendar girls had all got their kit off in protest? Geoff Woollen Glasgow Blair's courtship of the WI was doomed from the start as he seemed to mime the words of Jerusalem.

      "bodyText": "A 12-year-old girl who received money from the Roman Catholic church in Scotland to enable her to keep her baby has been ordered to give the child up for adoption. The girl, who is understood to have learning difficulties, is said to be devastated after a court in Exeter last week approved a custody application by social workers in Torbay, Devon, forcing her to hand over the infant. The girl, who is in foster care, cannot be identified for legal reasons. Her case sparked controversy last year when it emerged that the church-backed Pro-Life Initiative had provided financial support during her pregnancy. The girl, who was 12 at the time, was the youngest person to have received money from the scheme, which was set up three years ago by the leader of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland, Cardinal Thomas Winning, to provide financial and practical support to young pregnant women. Co-ordinators of the scheme denied the payment was tantamount to a bribe to stop the 12-year-old having an abortion. They said that the girl was determined to keep the baby and that her father had approached them for help because he could not afford to support her. Abortion law reformers yesterday renewed their criticism of the Pro-Life group's payments. Jane Roe, campaign manager of Abortion Law Reform Society, said it had been clear from the beginning that any 12-year-old girl would find it very hard to bring up a child even with a great deal of family support. \"Our real concern was that the church offered money for something which was not in the girl's best interests and I don't think they looked very carefully into the circumstances of this case before they gave that help.\" Roseann Reddy, who runs the Pro-Life group, was unavailable for comment yesterday. But a spokesman for the Catholic church in Scotland defended the decision to protect the unborn child. \"We don't make any comment on people who come to us for help. We don't set about judgment.

They are also demanding a bored tunnel, instead of the highways agency's cheaper \"cut and cover\" version, involving digging a trench across the landscape and then filling it in over the tunnel roof. The highways agency estimates its tunnel at \u00a3125m, and the bored tunnel at \u00a3300m. The management plan does not explicitly back the long tunnel, but repeatedly stresses the unique importance of the entire site, a 5,000-year-old ritual landscape littered with thousands of ancient monuments apart from the stone circle. The plan backs proposals to return the land to open chalk downland grazing, and says that farmers will have to be compensated for abandoning arable farming and deep ploughing. It also stresses that the site must be protected from noise and light pollution from traffic, which the objectors believe would be impossible with the shorter tunnel. Local archaeologist Kate Fielden, who represented the Council for the Protection of Rural England at consultations on the plan, demanded yesterday that the road scheme, which she called \"hugely damaging\", should be abandoned.

Dominic McCarthy, who was 34, died in Hinchingbrooke hospital, Huntingdon, on February 9 1997, after lapsing into a coma at their home in Stonely, Cambridgeshire, on January 31.

      "body": "<p>Football, the seemingly unstoppable cash cow, is set to grow even fatter during Euro 2000. The event is expected be one of the most lucrative in sports history. Against a backdrop of 100% increases in the cost of Champions League sponsorship and protests from potential sponsors of the event including General Motors-owned Opel about the price increases, the cost of Euro 2000 sponsorship rights has soared to \u00a37m for each of the main sponsors - including Coca Cola, Carlsberg and Mastercard, with KLM and Alitalia as the tournament's official airlines. This compares with fees of about \u00a33m for Euro 96. </p> <p>European TV rights are estimated to have reached as much as \u00a31.6m and the 40 official merchandise licensees for the tournament stand to make significant gains as retail sales are predicted to double from \u00a3150m in 1996 to more than \u00a3300m, said Copyright Promotions, the tournament's licensing agents. </p> <p>Mike Reynolds, spokesman for the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, says that to stand out \"companies must spend above and beyond the initial investment\". The ISS estimates that football sponsorship in Britain alone is worth more than \u00a3100m per year - a figure matched only by formula one motor racing. </p> <p><strong> Value for money</strong><br> Mr Reynolds claims that while these sums may appear high, the major global players who invest the most, stand to gain the most. The downside is that those companies which do not supplement initial investments may not see the full benefits. </p> <p>Carlsberg, a long-term European Championships sponsor, says Euro 2000 is so central to Carlsberg's strategy that it is backing up its investment with an additional \u00a310m in Britain alone - or the whole of Carlsberg's marketing budget for the time of year, a spokesman confirmed. </p> <p>Steve Cumming, sponsorship manager for Carlsberg in Britain, said that in addition to branding at the tournament, the company will have promotions and advertising, including a one-off competition via pubs and promotions at Tesco. </p> <p>Merchandising licenses are expected to reap rewards greater than World Cup 98 for companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Adidas, Electronic Arts and Character Group, which are making and selling products ranging from clothes and accessories to cuddly toys and face paints. Competition for licences was fierce, according to one licensee. The amounts paid for the licences are undisclosed but if the licensees get it right they will find themselves in a strong position for upcoming events including the World Cup in 2002. </p> <p>M&amp;S, with exclusive rights to boyswear ranging from sweatshirts to toddler outfits, confirmed that the range \"has already almost sold out\". </p> <p>Bernard Phee, sponsorship manager for M&amp;S, said: \"Football is undoubtedly something we will continue to look at. We are involved in England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup and if this is successful, even greater involvement would be something to consider.\" </p> <p>The business of licensing can be hit and miss as Character Group learned when its share price suffered when it issued a profit warning in April after substantially overestimating demand for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace merchandise. </p> <p>Jon Diver, marketing director at Character Group, said the company had gone into the Euro 2000 deal with the lessons of the the Phantom Menace in mind. </p> <p>\"We have definitely protected our position. Our strategy has been to go in, get out and move on. We are on course to clear most of the merchandise at retailers before the tournament even starts but there is a possibility we may have under supplied the market this time.\" </p> <p>Even when an event is a runaway success, investors' revenues are under threat. Companies can often avoid paying for sponsorship yet still capitalise on an event by other means.

      "bodyText": "Football, the seemingly unstoppable cash cow, is set to grow even fatter during Euro 2000. The event is expected be one of the most lucrative in sports history. Against a backdrop of 100% increases in the cost of Champions League sponsorship and protests from potential sponsors of the event including General Motors-owned Opel about the price increases, the cost of Euro 2000 sponsorship rights has soared to \u00a37m for each of the main sponsors - including Coca Cola, Carlsberg and Mastercard, with KLM and Alitalia as the tournament's official airlines. This compares with fees of about \u00a33m for Euro 96. European TV rights are estimated to have reached as much as \u00a31.6m and the 40 official merchandise licensees for the tournament stand to make significant gains as retail sales are predicted to double from \u00a3150m in 1996 to more than \u00a3300m, said Copyright Promotions, the tournament's licensing agents. Mike Reynolds, spokesman for the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, says that to stand out \"companies must spend above and beyond the initial investment\". The ISS estimates that football sponsorship in Britain alone is worth more than \u00a3100m per year - a figure matched only by formula one motor racing. Value for money Mr Reynolds claims that while these sums may appear high, the major global players who invest the most, stand to gain the most. The downside is that those companies which do not supplement initial investments may not see the full benefits. Carlsberg, a long-term European Championships sponsor, says Euro 2000 is so central to Carlsberg's strategy that it is backing up its investment with an additional \u00a310m in Britain alone - or the whole of Carlsberg's marketing budget for the time of year, a spokesman confirmed. Steve Cumming, sponsorship manager for Carlsberg in Britain, said that in addition to branding at the tournament, the company will have promotions and advertising, including a one-off competition via pubs and promotions at Tesco. Merchandising licenses are expected to reap rewards greater than World Cup 98 for companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Adidas, Electronic Arts and Character Group, which are making and selling products ranging from clothes and accessories to cuddly toys and face paints. Competition for licences was fierce, according to one licensee. The amounts paid for the licences are undisclosed but if the licensees get it right they will find themselves in a strong position for upcoming events including the World Cup in 2002. M&amp;S, with exclusive rights to boyswear ranging from sweatshirts to toddler outfits, confirmed that the range \"has already almost sold out\". Bernard Phee, sponsorship manager for M&amp;S, said: \"Football is undoubtedly something we will continue to look at. We are involved in England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup and if this is successful, even greater involvement would be something to consider.\" The business of licensing can be hit and miss as Character Group learned when its share price suffered when it issued a profit warning in April after substantially overestimating demand for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace merchandise. Jon Diver, marketing director at Character Group, said the company had gone into the Euro 2000 deal with the lessons of the the Phantom Menace in mind. \"We have definitely protected our position. Our strategy has been to go in, get out and move on. We are on course to clear most of the merchandise at retailers before the tournament even starts but there is a possibility we may have under supplied the market this time.\" Even when an event is a runaway success, investors' revenues are under threat. Companies can often avoid paying for sponsorship yet still capitalise on an event by other means. Sources at Opel, for example, say they get better value for their money by sponsoring individual teams, such as AC Milan, at the big tournaments. Counterfeit threat Counterfeiting is a very real threat for merchandisers. ISL, the marketing company responsible for Euro 2000, say it is working closely with trading standards officers in the host countries to minimise the threat. However, a spokesman for Copyright Promotions conceded that goods will slip through the net. \"It is impossible for me to put a figure on it but we can't deny that this is a problem. Rotterdam is Europe's largest port after all.\" At the heart of the anti-counterfeiting effort is Delta Labelling, a small British garment labelling company based in Tamworth. It supplies all Euro 2000 licensees with labels that have hidden security codes sewn into them which can then be identified by customs with a simple test. Jim Bowman, one of the company's directors, said: \"As these types of events escalate in size, security is becoming extremely important. Counterfeiting is a big problem and we identified this area as one of growing importance.\" Delta Labelling is already negotiating for the World Cup 2002 licence. Euro 2000 is also benefiting broadcasters. ITV is set to make \u00a325m with demand for air-time surging, compared with an \u00a38m decline in revenues during the 1998 World Cup when it was accused by many advertisers of overpricing. Eurosport, which is screening the tournament across Europe, will run 450 hours of coverage sponsored by Carlsberg, Fuji, Philips and Hyundai, says it has already sold its complete advertising inventory. If Euro 2000 tells us anything, it is that the football bubble is far from bursting. Where the money goes \u0095 Thirtyone matches will be played over three weeks starting tomorrow \u0095 European TV rights cost upwards of \u00a31.6bn \u0095 Event sponsors paid \u00a37m each, double that for Euro 96 \u0095 Retail sales of merchandise worldwide are expected to double that of Euro 96 to \u00a3300m \u0095 Ladbrokes and William Hill predict Euro 2000 will break betting records in the UK with stakes exceeding \u00a3100m",

      "bodyText": "The longest ever Olympic torch relay began its 16,740-mile journey across Australia yesterday against the backdrop of the massive monolith of Uluru, or Ayers Rock, in the spiritual centre of the continent. The first Aborigine to win an Olympic gold medal, Nova Peris-Kneebone, 29, was handed the torch by tribal elders. Holding aloft the sleek blue and silver torch, she started to run toward the giant glowing Ayers rock, which she described as the heart and \"belly of Australia\". The local Anangu people, the traditional owners of the area, played a key part in the elaborate ceremonies. In his welcoming speech Reggie Kunmanara Uluru, a member of the Uluru family, said in the local Pitjantjatjara language: \"We have been using traditional firesticks since ancient times, and we are proud to welcome this special torch here today.\" The second runner at the most sacred of sites for black Australians was the Aboriginal actor Ernie Dingo, followed by the former Wimbledon tennis champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley. The flame, which left Olympia in Greece a month ago, had arrived in Australia after travelling through 12 Oceanic nations and had last touched down in New Zealand en route to Australia. Despite a strong wind which blew out the flame twice, the handover ceremony at Uluru was described by many Australians as a moving and historic moment. Peris-Kneebone, who ran barefoot, was the first of 11,000 runners who will carry the torch around Australia, taking in an underwater section of the Great Barrier Reef before arriving at Stadium Australia on September 15. \"This will never happen again, and to have the honour of [being] the first Australian is probably something that I'll sit back and have a good cry about,\" Peris-Kneebone said after her mile-long run. Accompanied by a phalanx of police, standby runners and 40 vehicles, the torch reached Alice Springs by sunset. After a swag of public acrimony about the games concerning unfair ticketing, nepotism and other breaches of the Olympic tradition, the prime minister, John Howard, said the arrival indicated an end to the bickering. \"I think from now on everybody's going to focus on the positives and in great Australian adaptive style we'll forget about all the negative stuff that's gone on over the last couple of years,\" he said. \u0095 More than 100,000 condoms are expected to be made available to the 10,000 competitors at this year's Sydney Olympics in a range of colours, including gold, silver and bronze.",

A stand of 80 between Stewart and Ally Brown, assisted by mediocre Derbyshire change bowling, cleared the first-innings arrears of 53, but Dominic Cork plucked a magnificent one-handed catch in his follow-through to dismiss Stewart and Brown, after sallying to 75 from 110 balls, became one of three middle-order victims for Matthew Cassar. When Derbyshire replied Di Venuto, bowled by an Alex Tudor no-ball, dashed to his fifty from 47 balls, then blocked for the morning. Martin Bicknell's disgust, when Rob Bailey was not given out caught at the wicket, brought delighted howls from the recesses of the old racing stand. They love Surrey-baiting around here.",

Henry said yes.\" Another condition was that South Africa should not score more than 270 runs. </p> <p>Asked why he agreed to accept, Gibbs explained that his parents had just divorced and that his father was unable to support Gibbs' mother financially. \"I knew I was going to have to look after her for the rest of her life and I was thinking of her,\" Gibbs said. </p> <p>The United Cricket Board of South Africa's counsel, Jeremy Gauntlett, took Gibbs through seven instances when he had lied about his involvement and asked him to explain why he had lied. </p> <p>\"I was scared and uncertain, and I was protecting Hansie,\" Gibbs replied, frequently drinking water and wiping the palms of his hands on his trousers. Gibbs said that Cronje had contacted him on at least three occasions and told him to keep lying. </p> <p>He was eventually persuaded to confess by the South African wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. \"Mark wanted to know if I had been honest the whole time,\" Gibbs said. \"I kept on saying 'yes'. </p> <p>\"He said: 'If you don't come clean now and you lie in court you're going to go to jail.' Then I told him the truth.\" </p> <p>Gibbs, who eventually did not receive any money, said he \"forgot\" about the deal during the match in question, lashing his first two balls to the boundary on his way to blasting 74 from 53 balls. He then described the extraor dinary scenario where Cronje came out to join him and Gibbs asked: \"What do we do now?\" </p> <p>Cronje said that one of them needed to get out but that Gibbs should carry on while Cronje sacrificed his own wicket. </p> <p>In the end South Africa's total still exceeded the \"goal\" as they made 320 for seven. Williams then failed to achieve his \"target\" when he broke down with a shoulder injury after bowling 11 balls. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday the inquiry received a copy of Cronje's handwritten confession which was handed to the board's security chief Rory Steyn in the early hours of April 11 and later passed on to the priest Ray McCauley. Steyn, who had been summoned to Cronje's hotel, told the inquiry that Cronje was fully clothed, his bags were packed and he was in a poor emotional state. </p> <p>\"His eyes were wide open and he was on the verge of tears. He must have broken down on two or three occasions ... He said he couldn't live with the lies, they were eating him up.\" </p> <p>Steyn said Cronje wrote that he had accepted \"$20-25,000\" before crossing that figure out and writing \"$10-15,000\". </p> <p>Cronje, in his confession, said his troubles began when Mohammad \"Hamid\" Cassim approached him after the fifth test against England at Centurion Park, when Cronje's surprise last-day declaration set up an England win. </p> <p>\"He told me that, if only he knew I was going to declare, he could have made himself some good money,\" Cronje wrote. </p> <p>\"Since that day, in a moment of stupidity and weakness, I allowed Satan and the world to dictate terms to me, rather than the Lord.\" </p> <p>The former spinner Derek Crookes said yesterday he was shocked when Cronje told him about an offer to lose a match in India in 1996. \"I asked him if he was joking. Hansie replied that I should think about it.\" </p> <p>The current test batsman Daryll Cullinan told the inquiry he had laughed off the proposal as a \"stroke of genius\" designed to boost team morale. \"I dismissed it as typical of his sense of humour.\" </p> <p>Williams, Nicky Boje and Pieter Strydom are due to give evidence today. </p> <p>Gibbs, meanwhile, has probably seen the last of his international career. The UCBSA is meeting this morning and is likely to decide to exclude him from the tour of Sri Lanka, which begins in July.</p>",

The visibly distressed opening batsman described how Cronje had come to the hotel room he was sharing with the fast bowler Henry Williams \"with a big grin on his face, early on the morning of the match in Nagpur, and said: 'Someone can pay you $15,000 if you score less than 20'. \"Henry was just getting out of the shower and Hansie told him he could get the same amount for bowling his 10 overs for not less than 50. Henry said yes.\" Another condition was that South Africa should not score more than 270 runs. Asked why he agreed to accept, Gibbs explained that his parents had just divorced and that his father was unable to support Gibbs' mother financially. \"I knew I was going to have to look after her for the rest of her life and I was thinking of her,\" Gibbs said. The United Cricket Board of South Africa's counsel, Jeremy Gauntlett, took Gibbs through seven instances when he had lied about his involvement and asked him to explain why he had lied. \"I was scared and uncertain, and I was protecting Hansie,\" Gibbs replied, frequently drinking water and wiping the palms of his hands on his trousers. Gibbs said that Cronje had contacted him on at least three occasions and told him to keep lying. He was eventually persuaded to confess by the South African wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. \"Mark wanted to know if I had been honest the whole time,\" Gibbs said. \"I kept on saying 'yes'. \"He said: 'If you don't come clean now and you lie in court you're going to go to jail.' Then I told him the truth.\" Gibbs, who eventually did not receive any money, said he \"forgot\" about the deal during the match in question, lashing his first two balls to the boundary on his way to blasting 74 from 53 balls. He then described the extraor dinary scenario where Cronje came out to join him and Gibbs asked: \"What do we do now?\" Cronje said that one of them needed to get out but that Gibbs should carry on while Cronje sacrificed his own wicket. In the end South Africa's total still exceeded the \"goal\" as they made 320 for seven. Williams then failed to achieve his \"target\" when he broke down with a shoulder injury after bowling 11 balls. Earlier yesterday the inquiry received a copy of Cronje's handwritten confession which was handed to the board's security chief Rory Steyn in the early hours of April 11 and later passed on to the priest Ray McCauley. Steyn, who had been summoned to Cronje's hotel, told the inquiry that Cronje was fully clothed, his bags were packed and he was in a poor emotional state. \"His eyes were wide open and he was on the verge of tears. He must have broken down on two or three occasions ... He said he couldn't live with the lies, they were eating him up.\" Steyn said Cronje wrote that he had accepted \"$20-25,000\" before crossing that figure out and writing \"$10-15,000\". Cronje, in his confession, said his troubles began when Mohammad \"Hamid\" Cassim approached him after the fifth test against England at Centurion Park, when Cronje's surprise last-day declaration set up an England win. \"He told me that, if only he knew I was going to declare, he could have made himself some good money,\" Cronje wrote. \"Since that day, in a moment of stupidity and weakness, I allowed Satan and the world to dictate terms to me, rather than the Lord.\" The former spinner Derek Crookes said yesterday he was shocked when Cronje told him about an offer to lose a match in India in 1996. \"I asked him if he was joking. Hansie replied that I should think about it.\" The current test batsman Daryll Cullinan told the inquiry he had laughed off the proposal as a \"stroke of genius\" designed to boost team morale. \"I dismissed it as typical of his sense of humour.\" Williams, Nicky Boje and Pieter Strydom are due to give evidence today. Gibbs, meanwhile, has probably seen the last of his international career. The UCBSA is meeting this morning and is likely to decide to exclude him from the tour of Sri Lanka, which begins in July.",
