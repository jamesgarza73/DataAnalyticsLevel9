      "body": "<p><strong> Novels</strong><br> </p> <p> Music and Silence, by Rose Tremain (Vintage, \u00a36.99). Clever novel of music and morality at the 17th-century Danish court. For collectors of fine literature. </p> <p> Norwegian Wood, by Haruki Murakami (Harvill, \u00a315). Name-making early work by a Japanese novelist who is now emerging on to the world stage, cutely produced in a two-volume boxed set. For people who like to keep ahead of the game. </p> <p> The Poisonwood Bible, by Barbara Kingsolver (Faber, \u00a37.99). Missionary colonialism and family dysfunction in the Belgian Congo. Much better than this year's Prodigal Summer (Faber, \u00a317.99). </p> <p> The Hiding Place, by Trezza Azzopardi (Picador, \u00a314.99). First novel set in Cardiff's Maltese community. Seems to appeal more to women than to men. </p> <p> White Teeth, by Zadie Smith (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99). The must-have book of the year. Buy from Waterstone's Piccadilly for a customised inscription (see Loafer). </p> <p> The Blind Assassin, by Margaret Atwood (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99). This year's Booker winner, therefore a guaranteed talking point. </p> <p> The Fountain Overflows, by Rebecca West (Virago, \u00a37.99). It's a good time to plug into the rehabilitation of West, whose sadly tarnished reputation received a fillip this year with the publication of her Selected Letters (Yale, \u00a322.50). </p> <p> And the Ass Saw the Angel, by Nick Cave (Penguin, \u00a37.99). First published 10 years ago and reissued this autumn, this is a fantasy of southern-gothic trailer trash that will appeal to fans of Iain Banks or, natch, Nick Cave. </p> <p><strong> Arts/Celebrity</strong><br> </p> <p> The Saul Steinberg Masquerade, by Saul Steinberg and Inge Morath (Viking Studio, \u00a313.55). Great collection of pictures taken in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Magnum photojournalist Inge Morath of the friends - including her husband, Arthur Miller - who donned paper bags transformed into amusing masks by New Yorker cartoonist Saul Steinberg. </p> <p> Face Forward, by Kevyn Aucoin (Little Brown, \u00a325). Celebrity snaps and make-up tips from one of the most successful make-up artists working today, with case studies including Sharon Stone, Celine Dion and Julianne Moore. </p> <p><strong> For small children</strong><br> </p> <p> You can't go wrong with Lucy Cousins's Maisy books. Happy Christmas Maisy (Walker Books, \u00a37.99) is everywhere, but Count With Maisy (WB, \u00a34.99) is more colourful. </p> <p> Pumpkin Soup (Yearling Books, \u00a34.99) and The Baby Who Wouldn't Go to Bed (Corgi, \u00a34.99), both by Helen Cooper. Good illustrations, great for reading aloud. </p> <p> The Gigantic Turnip , by Aleksei Tolstoy (Barefoot, \u00a34.99). Beautiful illustrations by Niamh Sharky, and again great to read aloud. </p> <p><strong> For older children</strong><br> </p> <p> The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster (HarperCollins, \u00a35.99). A good choice for those who love the Harry Potter books, but have devoured all of them. </p> <p> Howl's Moving Castle, by Diana Wynne Jones (HarperCollins, \u00a34.99). Featuring Howl the wizard and the Witch of the Waste, this is just one of Wynne Jones's books to be republished on the back of the Potter boom. Has a similar cult readership of clubbed-out adults. </p> <p> Northern Lights, by Philip Pullman (Scholastic, \u00a35.99). First of a trilogy that culminated this autumn in The Amber Spyglass (Scholastic, \u00a314.99). No 10- to 14-year-old should be without it. </p> <p><strong> For big boys</strong><br> </p> <p> My Name's Bond, James Bond, ed Simon Winder (The Penguin Press/ Allen Lane, \u00a39.99).

Ten years of sports on TV, as witnessed by one of the wittiest writers working in newspapers today. </p> <p><strong> For Londoners</strong><br> </p> <p> London, a Biography by Peter Ackroyd (Chatto, \u00a325) is perhaps the most obvious choice, but the connoisseurs' title has to be the London Photographic Atlas (HarperCollins, \u00a350), an irresistible combination of getmapping.com's aerial millennium maps with Collins's cartography. </p> <p><strong> For anti-Londoners</strong><br> </p> <p> Wives and Daughters, by Elizabeth Gaskell (Penguin, \u00a34.99). This year's BBC dramatisation made a good case for this underrated Victorian novelist. Her North and South (Oxford, \u00a32.99) is a great expression of Northern jingoism. </p> <p><strong> For everyone (with a mobile)</strong><br> </p> <p> Wan2tlk? by Gabrielle Mander (Michael O'Mara, \u00a31.99). The text message is the new telegraphese. Here's its best-selling lexicon. </p> <p><strong> Science</strong><br> </p> <p> Trilobite - Eyewitness to Evolution , by Richard Fortey (HarperCollins, \u00a315.99). Well written and authoritative: a pop-science book driven by obsession rather than the pursuit of quick bucks. </p> <p> Seeing and Believing, by Richard Panek (Fourth Estate, \u00a35.99). The extraordinary story of the telescope, for collectors of pocket science. </p> <p><strong> Memoir</strong><br> </p> <p> Dear Tom: Letters From Home, by Tom Courtenay (Doubleday, \u00a316.99). Courtenay's memoirs of his mother's correspondence with him when he was a young actor; includes letters and poetry. </p> <p><strong> History</strong><br> </p> <p> Big Chief Elizabeth, by Giles Milton (Hodder, \u00a314.99). Story of the Elizabethan conquest of America by the author of Nathaniel's Nutmeg (Sceptre, \u00a36.99). Will appeal to consumers of pop history. </p> <p> A History of Britain 1, by Simon Schama (BBC, \u00a325). The first volume of the book of the TV history series runs from 3000BC to AD1603. More adventurous Schamaphiles will relish his earlier Landscape and Memory (Fontana, \u00a316.99) or his history of the French Revolution, Citizens (Penguin, \u00a320). </p> <p><strong> For foodies</strong><br> </p> <p> Les Liaisons Culinaires , by Andreas Staikos (Harvill, \u00a310). Charming tale of two men living in adjacent Athens flats who gradually realise they are being taken for a culinary ride by the same woman.

Agnes Samuel is the glamorous stranger who turns up one night in a black taxi in an East Anglian village. She captivates everyone, including the Throckmortons, who have lived in Warboys for centuries. Few are initially immune to her green eyes and charm, but gradually enemies gather and in the Throckmorton family, of which she has become a part, tragedy follows tragedy. Yet everything points away from Agnes.

In her 20s, flat-sharing and hoping to achieve the things she promised herself as a teenager.

Her descriptions of Friday-night traffic jams and post-excess Sundays demonstrate power and sensitivity. It's very much a debut novel - the central flaw is a lack of distance - but Twelve is an acutely observed picture of contemporary dissatisfaction. </p> <p> <strong> Driving The Heart</strong><br> Jason Brown<br> (Vintage, \u00a36.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502405522,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> These are short stories on the American model: the writing drawn taut over meticulous frameworks, tracking the archetypes of 20th-century America. The title story is the road movie - a driver taking a heart cross-country from city to district hospital. Suburban scenes of everyday misery are inescapably Carveresque, while the moments and people Brown describes share that sense of an awful, suspended instant with the paintings of Edward Hopper. That is not to say Brown is derivative; he is a very good writer, relentlessly economical and adept at portraying highly nuanced emotion. Still, we are perhaps over-familiar with these fictional suburbias. </p> <p> <strong> The Collected Stories</strong><br> Clare Boylan<br> (Abacus, \u00a37.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000302530,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> The stories here have been read on Radio 4 and printed in women's magazines and newspapers. They are emotionally and physically more cluttered than Jason Brown's, perhaps because of the use of British domestic interiors as opposed to strip-lit diners. Boylan's leitmotif is collision - between lovers, new acquaintances, parents and their children - or simply the eternal misunderstandings between men and women, eloquently and slyly portrayed by the opening story, \"Housekeeper's Cut\". Excellent in their sphere; my one complaint is that these 38 stories, deserve a unifying introduction from Boylan or a critic. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Memoirs of a Gnostic Dwarf</strong><br> David Madsen<br> (Dedalus, \u00a38.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501571242,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Dedalus specialises in fiction that could roughly be classified as gothic or arcane - or indeed gnostic.

      "body": "<p>In the preface of her recent biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour candidly indulges the romance of many a literary biographer. She sits in London's St Pancras churchyard, a grim urban island between traffic roar and railway lines, and imagines herself 200 years back when it was the edge of the countryside. She sees Mary Godwin as a child visiting the grave of her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. She dreams of her later courtship by Percy Shelley in the same place (though she does not say whether she visualises their making love at the graveside, as they seem to have done). </p> <p>By the look of her acknowledgments, Seymour has spent most of her research time in that sanctum of the professional biographer, the London Library. Yet only visiting the haunts of her characters really \"brings the past to life with a jump\": \"climbing the steep twisting path up to the Casa Bertini, the Shelleys' home at Bagni di Lucca, sneaking, without permission, up to the dusty library of books on the top floor of Byron's grand palace on the Lung'Arno at Pisa\". Her dream is of a sudden closeness to the very personality of a writer, and enough readers share that dream to make literary biography the one common way in which literature is discussed outside academic publications. It is also a clue to the preference of biographers for certain kinds of writer: those who seem to make their personalities the matter of their writing - especially those whom we call \"romantic\". </p> <p>The work which has most influenced biographers (and publishers) who would realise this ideal has been Richard Holmes's 1974 Shelley: The Pursuit . Holmes set the standard as well as the trend for romantic biographies that could reach a middle-brow market while achieving academic respectability. His subtitle tells us of the quest of the biographer as well as of the idealism of the poet whom he was trying to recover. The special relationship between biographer and writer was suggested again by the subtitle of his hugely successful follow-up volume, Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer . \"Romantic\" here refers both to Holmes's quarry and to himself. It takes a romantic to follow the tracks of a personality past the usual rows of dates in search of an inner character. </p> <p>Holmes's latest volume, Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer, pursues the association and the idea that characters might be rediscovered in a kind of geographical wandering. His introduction declares that his tracking down of all the writers who have intrigued him has amounted to one large composite picture of the romantic artist. Such a creator peculiarly allures biographers by appearing to enact the oneness of life and writing. Janet Todd begins her new biography by observing that Wollstonecraft seems to thrust her life upon the reader. Her most successful and appealing work (William Godwin said it made him fall in love with her) was her Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, an extraordinary combination of intellectual analysis and abrupt confession. </p> <p>Equally, AC Grayling's new life of William Hazlitt characterises him as \"a completely autobiographical author\". \"He lived a confessional existence, transposing his experience into literature, writing with stark honesty.\" Grayling gives special attention and sympathy to Hazlitt's Liber Amoris, a self- humbling account of the middle-aged author's unrequited passion for his landlady's teenage daughter. Taking emotional candour beyond all normal limits, it attracted ridicule and disgust from contemporaries. To the delight of today's biographers, he was but one of a generation of writers who made literature out of their own lives. So many of the greatest works of the period are autobiographies: Wordsworth's The Prelude, Coleridge's Biographia Literaria, Byron's Childe Harold and Don Juan, De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium Eater. </p> <p>And because of the interest of these writers in the self, and in the creative imagination that dignified the self, the lives and characters of writers were attended to as never before. The modern biographer has rich resources of contemporary memoirs, full of intimacies and animosities between famous writers. A representative record is Hazlitt's \"My First Acquaintance with Poets\", its very title seeming to tell of his meeting with a new breed of humanity. Written 25 years after the event, it remembers his first encounter with Wordsworth in 1798. \"He was quaintly dressed (according to the costume of that unconstrained period) in a brown fustian jacket and striped pantaloons ... There was a severe, worn pressure of thought about his temples, a fire in his eye (as if he saw something in objects more than the outward appearance).\" </p> <p>This sense of the creator encountered immediately in the character and life of the author repeats itself again and again in the memoirs admirers wrote of the leading romantic authors. Such sources confirm the mission of the latter-day biographer, whose romantic bias might explain the interest in writers at the edge of the romantic period. There have been two substantial new lives of Fanny Burney in the last two years, as well as Peter Martin's life of James Boswell, who has become a romantic writer avant la lettre. More recently there has been Adam Sisman's Boswell's Presumptuous Task, an account of Boswell's making of his Life of Johnson. John Mortimer, choosing it as his book of the year in the Guardian, talks of Boswell taking \"the author of some rather dull plays and pontificating journalism\" and turning him into one of the great literary characters. It is as if a romantic artist were touching the costive old 18th century with his wand. </p> <p>It was Johnson who first raised the esteem of literary biography with his Lives of the Poets , accounts of English authors that are utterly unromantic. His Dryden is a portrait of lofty sycophancy; his Pope full of anguished animosity and self-promotion. These studies in the life of writing belong to a different age, one represented by the outstanding anatomy of an author published this year, Howard Erskine-Hill's Alexander Pope: Selected Letters. Pope's shimmering correspondence - witty, acid, duplicitous, entirely literary in its construction - is a terrible puzzle for a modern biographer. No private self is ever on display; it is all too deft and knowing. </p> <p>It is notable that when biography for the general reader turns to the pre-romantic 18th century it is more attracted to aristocrats and eccentrics than to writers. Lucy Moore's Amphibious Thing: The Life of Lord Hervey is a biography of the epicene Whig courtier who was cruelly immortalised as Sporus (\"This painted child of dirt that stinks and stings\") in Pope's \"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\". At its heart is an account of his homosexual relationship with Stephen Fox, recorded, if obliquely, in their surviving correspondence. Yet here we find a pale reflection of Pope's example: Hervey's letters are literary exercises rather than explorations of the self. It is not even clear whether the relationship was anything more than a high-camp literary exercise. Moore's book looks like the offspring of Amanda Foreman's hugely successful Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, also hot on sexual adventure among the titled, but has little of Foreman's saving weight of research. Neither is it a patch on the biographical work that set off the fashion: Stella Tillyard's 1994 Aristocrats. </p> <p>Sexual adventure features, of course, in the stories of many authors of the romantic age. It often seems like another aspect of the rebelliousness that so appeals to biographers (Seymour, Grayling and Todd all find their subjects heroically unconventional). The great writers of the romantic age stand out against their age; their idealism is always to be rescued from the censorship of earlier commentators. This need gives many literary biographies an oddly partisan quality. Seymour notes how often Mary Shelley was made to take the blame by her husband's posthumous followers for whatever aspect of his behaviour needed to be wished away. </p> <p>The attention, sometimes devotion, to the singularity of one author seems often to involve taking sides. So biographies that feel enormously persuasive, imaginatively in sympathy with their subjects, look odd as soon as they are put next to each other. Coleridge, the hero of the imagination in Holmes's account, becomes a baleful paranoiac in Juliet Barker's recent life of Wordsworth. Hazlitt does not seem much better to her. Yet if, like Grayling, you are in the business of sympathising with Hazlitt's sad sexual yearnings, Wordsworth will appear stiff-necked for turning his back on him after he scandalised Keswick locals by spanking the bottom of a servant girl who had resisted his advances. </p> <p>There must be more on the way. Andrew Motion's Keats, though strictly speaking adding nothing to the knowledge gleaned by earlier lives, has probably warned biographers off for a while; ditto Ackroyd's Ackroydish Blake, while there have been two thorough lives of Byron aimed at the non-academic reader in the last three years. But literary biographers will keep returning to the romantics for the good reason that they seem to exemplify a proposition biographers would dearly like to believe: that to give an account of an author's life is to be taken to the very source of his or her writing.</p>",

E\u00e7a de Queiros (1845-1900) is (or was) Portugal's greatest novelist, but there is no shame in not knowing about him. He doesn't appear in Margaret Drabble's Oxford Companion to English Literature (first edition) which, despite its title, is otherwise quite good about these things. The interesting thing about him is that he was also a diplomat: between 1874 and 1888, he was a consul in Bristol and Newcastle. That is the period that concerns us here, for the book consists of a selection of his letters and reports to Lisbon. </p> <p>Now, if you have ever had to wade through official prose, a book of such matter hardly looks enticing. But almost immediately you realise that de Queiros is a great writer, really first-rate: not only did he have such strong command of his language that his ability shines through even in translation, but he was a meticulous and conscientious observer of the scene around him. By no means did he regard his job as a sinecure while he got on with his novels. </p> <p>These vivid and penetrating portraits have an astonishing immediacy. We British like reading those selections from the foreign press under the title \"How they see us\"; this is one of the supreme examples of the genre, up there with Custine on Russia or even Voltaire on England. Writing at the high season of Victorian pomp, influence and capitalist dynamism, de Queiros is not taken in; the view from Bristol and Newcastle is not the same as the view from London (although he writes from there too), and he is able to note the undercurrent of unrest that escapes the more conventional histories. Every strike, every rebellion, bears on Portugal's own interests: in the cycle of prosperity and want, we see that the Victorian economy was a lot more boom and bust, significantly more precarious than we have been led to believe. At times his indignation at the massive discrepancies in wealth takes wing, as in this closing paragraph to a letter dealing with the starving wretches on the Duke of Leicester's estates in Ireland: </p> <p>\"God has only one course to take with such useless humanity: drown it with a deluge. But drown it altogether, without repeating the fatal indulgence that led him to spare Noah: if it were not for the senile egoism of this drunken old patriarch, who wanted to go on living so he could go on drinking, we would today enjoy the ineffable happiness of non-existence.\" A cut above typical diplomatic prose, I think you'll agree. </p> <p>But he also has a great sense of humour, and he is alive to contemporary frivolities such as the sensation caused by Mr Pongo, a gorilla who smoked cigars and was the social catch of the day, or the adulteries of supposedly well-bred English women (\"it is enough to watch the behaviour of a modern English woman for a short time to see that she is quite capable of everything\"). His report on a practical joke played on the Times , when a bored typesetter inserted a paragraph of obscenities into a speech by Sir William Harcourt, Gladstone's most austere minister, is still genuinely hilarious.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Shortly after moving to England in 1933 when he was aged 16, the historian Eric Hobsbawm had to decide whether to study history, modern languages or literature at Cambridge university. As a child he had lived in Vienna and Berlin, and so he says it was no contest. \"If you were brought up in central Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, you were surrounded by history,\" he says. \"I couldn't very well avoid it.\" </p> <p>His writing career began when he became the last pre-war editor of the student magazine Granta, but he didn't publish his first book until 20 years later. Primitive Rebels, his ground-breaking study of banditry, was published in 1959, along with, perhaps unexpectedly, a collection of his writing on jazz. </p> <p>He'd been a jazz fan since seeing Duke Ellington play in Streatham in 1933. During the 1950s, the Observer had hired Kingsley Amis to write on the subject. Hobsbawm says he knew at least as much about jazz as Amis, and as he needed to earn some money, \"I talked myself into a column at the New Statesman. The book was pretty well received, but jazz is essentially an anti-social, late-night activity and not really conducive to a family life, so in the end I gave it up.\" </p> <p>In 1962 he published The Age of Revolution 1789-1848, the first volume of what was to become his hugely influential quartet covering the last 200 years. \"I probably would have published quite a bit earlier if it wasn't for the cold war,\" he says. \"Various people turned down earlier stuff because of my political views. In the 1950s it was difficult to get published if you were known as a fairly prominent and unreconstructed red. While it didn't actually endanger my career, it did slow it down.\" </p> <p>Although he was a long-time member of the Communist Party and an influential figure on the left, it wasn't until the late 1970s that Hobsbawm became well known to a general audience as a social and political commentator. His 1979 essay, \"The Forward March of Labour Halted\", was seen as calling time on Old Labour and laying the ground for the birth of New Labour. \"It was the one time when my writing had some direct effect,\" he says. \"It helped the turn to Kinnock and away from the Bennite left.\" Twenty years on, the consequences of this are not entirely to his taste. \"This government is not bad as governments go, but I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the Prime Minister. A man who says that the object of getting elected is to get re-elected cannot have a good programme. To someone of my background, a man whose speeches carefully avoid any kind of intellectual content - and he is an intelligent man, so it must be intentional - gets on my wick.\" </p> <p>Although The Age of Revolution started out as a single book, by the time he had finished The Age of Capital in 1975 he realised he was in fact in the middle of a much larger project. \"I wouldn't have had the courage to set out to do such a huge work if I had known,\" he says. The Age of Empire was published in 1987, and finally The Age of Extremes - his study of the 20th century - in 1994. It was a huge international bestseller. </p> <p>\"It did strike a nerve,\" says Hobsbawm, \"but that was partly because for about five years I had the subject to myself. Most people prepared their histories of the 20th century for this year, but the period I was interested in ended in the early 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" </p> <p>The history blockbuster has been one of the publishing phenomena of the last decade or so. Hobsbawm says there has always been a tradition in this country of historians writing for a wide public. \"You can go way back to people like Gibbon and Macauley, who wrote what they thought was serious stuff but addressed it to a broad as well as a specialised public. I also think that in recent years fiction has taken a back seat. Real-life stories are more incredible, thrilling and passionate than invented stories. And in our society, which seems to me to have no great roots in the past, people have a psychological need to place themselves and find out where they come from.\" </p> <p>Most of Hobsbawm's work has been accessible to the general reader. \"I have always regarded it as extremely important to produce something that people will not get bored with. I taught at Birkbeck college to part-time students in the evenings. The test was if I could keep them awake in the eight-to-nine slot when they had done a day's work and probably been to two other lectures before mine.\" </p> <p>His latest book, On the Edge of the New Century, is as much concerned with the future as the past. Through an interview format, Hobsbawm conducts a tour d'horizon of where we are and where we are heading. \"You cannot write a book that is dead up to date,\" he says. \"No one could have anticipated the great joke of the American elections.\" </p> <p>But he is generally happy that most of what he has written has stood up in the years since it was first published. He says the European Union \"is going to be more problematic than a lot of people think\", and that while humankind will probably become economically better off as a whole, he worries about the implications of \"widening social and economic inequities\". </p> <p>The book ends with Hobsbawm pronouncing that he \"cannot look to the future with great optimism\". Which, perversely, means a bright future for historians. \"Well,\" he says, \"at least we're not going to run short of subject matter, are we?\" </p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000467893,00.html\">Buy On the Edge of the New Century at BOL</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Shortly after moving to England in 1933 when he was aged 16, the historian Eric Hobsbawm had to decide whether to study history, modern languages or literature at Cambridge university. As a child he had lived in Vienna and Berlin, and so he says it was no contest. \"If you were brought up in central Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, you were surrounded by history,\" he says. \"I couldn't very well avoid it.\" His writing career began when he became the last pre-war editor of the student magazine Granta, but he didn't publish his first book until 20 years later. Primitive Rebels, his ground-breaking study of banditry, was published in 1959, along with, perhaps unexpectedly, a collection of his writing on jazz. He'd been a jazz fan since seeing Duke Ellington play in Streatham in 1933. During the 1950s, the Observer had hired Kingsley Amis to write on the subject. Hobsbawm says he knew at least as much about jazz as Amis, and as he needed to earn some money, \"I talked myself into a column at the New Statesman. The book was pretty well received, but jazz is essentially an anti-social, late-night activity and not really conducive to a family life, so in the end I gave it up.\" In 1962 he published The Age of Revolution 1789-1848, the first volume of what was to become his hugely influential quartet covering the last 200 years. \"I probably would have published quite a bit earlier if it wasn't for the cold war,\" he says. \"Various people turned down earlier stuff because of my political views. In the 1950s it was difficult to get published if you were known as a fairly prominent and unreconstructed red. While it didn't actually endanger my career, it did slow it down.\" Although he was a long-time member of the Communist Party and an influential figure on the left, it wasn't until the late 1970s that Hobsbawm became well known to a general audience as a social and political commentator. His 1979 essay, \"The Forward March of Labour Halted\", was seen as calling time on Old Labour and laying the ground for the birth of New Labour. \"It was the one time when my writing had some direct effect,\" he says. \"It helped the turn to Kinnock and away from the Bennite left.\" Twenty years on, the consequences of this are not entirely to his taste. \"This government is not bad as governments go, but I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the Prime Minister. A man who says that the object of getting elected is to get re-elected cannot have a good programme. To someone of my background, a man whose speeches carefully avoid any kind of intellectual content - and he is an intelligent man, so it must be intentional - gets on my wick.\" Although The Age of Revolution started out as a single book, by the time he had finished The Age of Capital in 1975 he realised he was in fact in the middle of a much larger project. \"I wouldn't have had the courage to set out to do such a huge work if I had known,\" he says. The Age of Empire was published in 1987, and finally The Age of Extremes - his study of the 20th century - in 1994. It was a huge international bestseller. \"It did strike a nerve,\" says Hobsbawm, \"but that was partly because for about five years I had the subject to myself. Most people prepared their histories of the 20th century for this year, but the period I was interested in ended in the early 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" The history blockbuster has been one of the publishing phenomena of the last decade or so. Hobsbawm says there has always been a tradition in this country of historians writing for a wide public. \"You can go way back to people like Gibbon and Macauley, who wrote what they thought was serious stuff but addressed it to a broad as well as a specialised public. I also think that in recent years fiction has taken a back seat. Real-life stories are more incredible, thrilling and passionate than invented stories. And in our society, which seems to me to have no great roots in the past, people have a psychological need to place themselves and find out where they come from.\" Most of Hobsbawm's work has been accessible to the general reader. \"I have always regarded it as extremely important to produce something that people will not get bored with. I taught at Birkbeck college to part-time students in the evenings. The test was if I could keep them awake in the eight-to-nine slot when they had done a day's work and probably been to two other lectures before mine.\" His latest book, On the Edge of the New Century, is as much concerned with the future as the past. Through an interview format, Hobsbawm conducts a tour d'horizon of where we are and where we are heading. \"You cannot write a book that is dead up to date,\" he says. \"No one could have anticipated the great joke of the American elections.\" But he is generally happy that most of what he has written has stood up in the years since it was first published. He says the European Union \"is going to be more problematic than a lot of people think\", and that while humankind will probably become economically better off as a whole, he worries about the implications of \"widening social and economic inequities\". The book ends with Hobsbawm pronouncing that he \"cannot look to the future with great optimism\". Which, perversely, means a bright future for historians. \"Well,\" he says, \"at least we're not going to run short of subject matter, are we?\" \u0095 Buy On the Edge of the New Century at BOL",

It seemed almost predestined that Percy Bysshe Shelley would fall in love with the daughter of his idols (conveniently bypassing the fact that he was already married) and spirit her away to continental Europe at a time when, as Wordsworth declared, \"The soil of common life was too hot to tread upon\". </p> <p>That Mary should have been depressed, isolated and resentful somehow failed to run in accordance with the script. Shelley seemed to register her moodiness as a betrayal, and turned towards Mary's much-resented half-sister, Claire Clairmont, for comfort.

Gros's great public canvases, such as Napoleon in the Plague Hospital at Jaffa and The Battle of Eylau, subtly undermine the heroism they blatantly celebrate. Gros, trained in the classic, idealist school of Jacques-Louis David, found himself in conflict with his master's rules: doubt overwhelmed 18th-century certainties.

With theatrical sang-froid, the 64-year-old Gros drowned himself, one of the masterpieces of the romantic movement. </p> <p>The idealism, social optimism and suppression of the self of an earlier age were overtaken by the introspective and subjective yearnings of the disillusioned tem perament.

Baudelaire's famous formulation that artists must take as their subject the \"heroism of modern life\" came out of a romantic disaffection with the immediate past. No more battle scenes. In Delacroix, Baudelaire found a contemporary he could idolise for his escapist imagination and neurasthenic sensibility. But Delacroix, in his subject matter, turned a blind eye to the present. When Baudelaire's call to order on behalf of the black frock coats and teeming boulevards of the day at last found expression in the magnificent hands of Manet and Degas, romanticism as an aesthetic movement was ready for burial. </p> <p>Taking all the chapters together, romanticism is seen here as a great cultural highway with side roads, rest stops, vistas and signposts. Brookner moves her characters along, watching anxiously as they speed or hesitate, drive straight or take unexpected turnings. It is a long, complex journey, described in resonant phrases and wrily humorous asides.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Constant Gardener</strong></p> <p> John le Carr\u00e9 </p> <p>508pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000414255,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> In medias res is where they say you should always start. John le Carr\u00e9's latest novel does just that, as news comes to the British High Commission in Nairobi that human-rights activist Tessa Quayle has been murdered - butchered - up in northern Kenya. We are soon in the morgue. Her husband Justin, also First Secretary at the High Commission, is faced with identifying her severed head: \"Her eyes closed and eyebrows raised and mouth open in lolling disbelief, black blood caked inside as if she'd had all her teeth pulled at the same time. You? she is blowing stupidly as they kill her, her mouth formed into an oo. You? \" </p> <p>Handsome, diffident Justin (the \"constant gardener\" of the title) at first appears not quite up to the task of tracking down her killers. As his colleague Sandy Woodrow puts it to the pair of British police who come over to investigate the murder, Justin \"loves nothing better than toiling in the flowerbeds on a Saturday afternoon - a gentleman , whatever that means - the right sort of Etonian, courteous to a fault ...\". </p> <p>It turns out that diffidence can be a powerful attribute when you are surrounded by scoundrels. At first Justin simply hides out in the house of one such, the very same Sandy. A slug of a man who used to ogle the beautiful Tessa, Sandy even sent her a love note in a moment of weakness. Now his own wife Gloria has taken a fancy to the grieving adult schoolboy (for so Justin initially seems) hiding in their guest suite: \"What are you doing down there? she wondered. Are you lying on your bed flailing yourself in the darkness? Or are you staring through your bars into the garden, talking to her ghost?\" </p> <p>The interior monologue of that passage is very typical of the way le Carr\u00e9 will let us have a bit of each character without losing his main focus. It is, however, mostly Justin's ghost-talking that we listen to, as his quest takes him to Elba (home of Tessa's Italian family), northern Germany, central Canada and south Sudan. And these aren't the only territories where classic le Carr\u00e9 tropes of betrayal and counter-betrayal can be turned and turned again. Another is cyberspace. There is much up-to-date business with computers here, including a neat twist with a virus. </p> <p>Justin makes his journeys like a kind of holy rogue agent, picking his way through shady commercial deals, government collusion and outright corruption as if he were on a latterday Pilgrim's Progress . Tessa had sent a report to the British government on the activities of pharmaceutical companies (\"pharmas\") in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, outlining the effects of an anti-tubercular drug which, improperly tested, is killing people. The government had hushed it up in the name of trade. </p> <p>Now they - the Brits and maybe others too - are watching Justin in case he makes the details public, spoiling the story that Tessa was killed by her charismatic black fellow activist and supposed lover Dr Arnold Bluhm. Justin doesn't believe that, neither the loving part nor the killing. Much of his divagation is concerned with a certain shadowy Swiss pharma. Could Tessa's murder have been a \"corporate job\"? </p> <p>What kind of job, you also want to ask, in medias res, is The Constant Gardener ? What are the connections between this novel's story and the real-world stories around and before it? Right at the start, mention is made of \"the sensational case of a young Englishwoman who had been hacked to pieces 10 years ago\" - a clear reference to the Julie Ward case. It doesn't take too much effort to find parallels between le Carr\u00e9's pharmas and actual ones, either. And what is the reality status of the \"President Moi\" and the \"Richard Leakey\" who figure in this book? One critic has already argued that a number of references in The Constant Gardener verge on the libellous. </p> <p>You say libel, I say docufiction, a tradition that goes back to Daniel Defoe. Whichever, this is newish ground for one of Britain's most skilful writers, and he works it very well. The enterprise is marred only by constant sniping references to the press. There is a legitimate scene in which dreadful hacks hustle the bereaved husband for answers: \" 'Do you reckon Bluhm topped her, Mr Quayle?' 'Hey, Justin, my proprietor is offering mega-mega-bucks.' \" But otherwise these attacks feel like bolted-on bits of moral outrage, forged elsewhere (a grudge? the writer's fear of exposure?); whereas the anger directed at the pharmas is germane to the plot, aesthetically organic. </p> <p>Like a lesser but similar author, Patrick O'Brian, John le Carr\u00e9 is a secretive man. In 1993 he himself issued a writ for libel on the basis of an outline for a biography submitted to a publisher by the Sunday Express 's Graham Lord (hardly a very threatening figure, it must be said). Perhaps simple antipathy to inquisitiveness is at the root of the problem. Another way of looking at it is that, in his autumn years, le Carr\u00e9 has entered his own docufiction: having made himself as much of a character in the public mind as those he creates, he doesn't want anyone to spoil the picture. </p> <p>The literary characters at least are fascinating; they always were. I find myself unable to agree with Salman Rushdie's contention, reviewing The Russia House in 1989, that \"there is something unavoidably stick-figure-like about le Carr\u00e9's attempts at characterisation ... All that public-school chatter, all those insufferable Americans and poetic/ tormented/ drunk Russians!\" </p> <p>Take a minor duo here, the police pair Rob and Lesley. They are brilliantly drawn - fragments of working-class le Carr\u00e9 gophers of old reassembled for the postmodern world. The same is true of the High Commission spook Donohue, with his bloodhound face, radio dials and knowledge of everything before it happens.

      "bodyText": "The Constant Gardener John le Carr\u00e9 508pp, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a316.99 Buy it at BOL In medias res is where they say you should always start. John le Carr\u00e9's latest novel does just that, as news comes to the British High Commission in Nairobi that human-rights activist Tessa Quayle has been murdered - butchered - up in northern Kenya. We are soon in the morgue. Her husband Justin, also First Secretary at the High Commission, is faced with identifying her severed head: \"Her eyes closed and eyebrows raised and mouth open in lolling disbelief, black blood caked inside as if she'd had all her teeth pulled at the same time. You? she is blowing stupidly as they kill her, her mouth formed into an oo. You? \" Handsome, diffident Justin (the \"constant gardener\" of the title) at first appears not quite up to the task of tracking down her killers. As his colleague Sandy Woodrow puts it to the pair of British police who come over to investigate the murder, Justin \"loves nothing better than toiling in the flowerbeds on a Saturday afternoon - a gentleman , whatever that means - the right sort of Etonian, courteous to a fault ...\". It turns out that diffidence can be a powerful attribute when you are surrounded by scoundrels. At first Justin simply hides out in the house of one such, the very same Sandy. A slug of a man who used to ogle the beautiful Tessa, Sandy even sent her a love note in a moment of weakness. Now his own wife Gloria has taken a fancy to the grieving adult schoolboy (for so Justin initially seems) hiding in their guest suite: \"What are you doing down there? she wondered. Are you lying on your bed flailing yourself in the darkness? Or are you staring through your bars into the garden, talking to her ghost?\" The interior monologue of that passage is very typical of the way le Carr\u00e9 will let us have a bit of each character without losing his main focus. It is, however, mostly Justin's ghost-talking that we listen to, as his quest takes him to Elba (home of Tessa's Italian family), northern Germany, central Canada and south Sudan. And these aren't the only territories where classic le Carr\u00e9 tropes of betrayal and counter-betrayal can be turned and turned again. Another is cyberspace. There is much up-to-date business with computers here, including a neat twist with a virus. Justin makes his journeys like a kind of holy rogue agent, picking his way through shady commercial deals, government collusion and outright corruption as if he were on a latterday Pilgrim's Progress . Tessa had sent a report to the British government on the activities of pharmaceutical companies (\"pharmas\") in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, outlining the effects of an anti-tubercular drug which, improperly tested, is killing people. The government had hushed it up in the name of trade. Now they - the Brits and maybe others too - are watching Justin in case he makes the details public, spoiling the story that Tessa was killed by her charismatic black fellow activist and supposed lover Dr Arnold Bluhm. Justin doesn't believe that, neither the loving part nor the killing. Much of his divagation is concerned with a certain shadowy Swiss pharma. Could Tessa's murder have been a \"corporate job\"? What kind of job, you also want to ask, in medias res, is The Constant Gardener ? What are the connections between this novel's story and the real-world stories around and before it? Right at the start, mention is made of \"the sensational case of a young Englishwoman who had been hacked to pieces 10 years ago\" - a clear reference to the Julie Ward case. It doesn't take too much effort to find parallels between le Carr\u00e9's pharmas and actual ones, either. And what is the reality status of the \"President Moi\" and the \"Richard Leakey\" who figure in this book? One critic has already argued that a number of references in The Constant Gardener verge on the libellous. You say libel, I say docufiction, a tradition that goes back to Daniel Defoe. Whichever, this is newish ground for one of Britain's most skilful writers, and he works it very well. The enterprise is marred only by constant sniping references to the press. There is a legitimate scene in which dreadful hacks hustle the bereaved husband for answers: \" 'Do you reckon Bluhm topped her, Mr Quayle?' 'Hey, Justin, my proprietor is offering mega-mega-bucks.' \" But otherwise these attacks feel like bolted-on bits of moral outrage, forged elsewhere (a grudge? the writer's fear of exposure?); whereas the anger directed at the pharmas is germane to the plot, aesthetically organic. Like a lesser but similar author, Patrick O'Brian, John le Carr\u00e9 is a secretive man. In 1993 he himself issued a writ for libel on the basis of an outline for a biography submitted to a publisher by the Sunday Express 's Graham Lord (hardly a very threatening figure, it must be said). Perhaps simple antipathy to inquisitiveness is at the root of the problem. Another way of looking at it is that, in his autumn years, le Carr\u00e9 has entered his own docufiction: having made himself as much of a character in the public mind as those he creates, he doesn't want anyone to spoil the picture. The literary characters at least are fascinating; they always were. I find myself unable to agree with Salman Rushdie's contention, reviewing The Russia House in 1989, that \"there is something unavoidably stick-figure-like about le Carr\u00e9's attempts at characterisation ... All that public-school chatter, all those insufferable Americans and poetic/ tormented/ drunk Russians!\" Take a minor duo here, the police pair Rob and Lesley. They are brilliantly drawn - fragments of working-class le Carr\u00e9 gophers of old reassembled for the postmodern world. The same is true of the High Commission spook Donohue, with his bloodhound face, radio dials and knowledge of everything before it happens. Donohue's golf-playing, mutually parasitical relationship with Kenny \"K\" Curtiss, the Maxwell-like entrepreneur whose shady ThreeBees outfit sells the bad pills for the Swiss in Africa, is very effectively rendered. It is also instructive. Is this the way le Carr\u00e9 will go now, laying bare the provisionality of relationships between states and multinationals and those who work for them, as before he dealt with the fate of individuals caught up in cold-war contingencies and the decline of post-imperial Britain? One lesson of the book is that the familiar old rot at the heart of government can spark some surprising alliances. When Rob and Lesley discover a connection between ThreeBees and the Swiss pharma, they are taken off the case. Piqued, they spring Justin from the surveillance of their colleagues and explain the modern British way to him: \"'The glorious House of ThreeBees is never to be mentioned again and that's an order,' Lesley said. 'Not their products, their operations or their staff. Nothing's allowed to rock the boat. Amen.'\" The African details feel as right and true as the British ones. Le Carr\u00e9 is very good on expatriate-servant relations, as in a moving scene in which the Quayle staff mourn the loss of their mistress: \"Justin drew Mustafa against him until Mustafa's clenched jaw rested on his shoulder ... Down the passage, other shadows had appeared ... Only Esmeralda was not weeping. Instead she wore that wooden look that whites mistake for churlishness or indifference. Woodrow knew it was neither. It was familiarity. This is how real life is constituted, it said. This is grief and hatred and people hacked to death. This is the everyday we have known since we were born and you Wazungu have not.\" As that passage demonstrates, le Carr\u00e9 does not have the \"almost colonialist arrogance\" of which he himself accused Rushdie with regard to The Satanic Verses . Yet it does take risks as a piece of writing, and it would be interesting to hear what Rushdie had to say about it.

Gamble has snapped all manner of men at work and play, from celebrities and artists (Hockney, Hawking, Bruno, Crisp) to hippies, sailors, drinkers and protesters.For the most part the pictures are unposed and spontaneous, framed to give us a glimpse of masculinity in process. Or should that be in crisis? </p> <p>Gamble instigated the project because \"after 20 years of feminist literature, there seemed a distinct lack of anything truly male\". Why the nostalgia for a gender purity that never existed? And why indict feminism alone, irrespective of myriad socio-economic factors? Thankfully, Gamble elects Will Self to address these questions, and his introduction is a characteristically curious and charming contemplation of what it is to be a man. </p> <p>He begins - where else? - with his father, rendering a portrait every bit as vivid as the photos that follow. Though a keen sportsman, Self senior exhibited neither talent nor alacrity in family matters, and would remain locked away in his study for hours despite the urgent pleas of wife and son. When he did engage with little Will it was to trounce him at sport, leaving the poor boy feeling \"tiny-dicked ... unmanned\". The young Self even dressed in contradistinction to his father, wearing drainpipe jeans instead of dad's flapping flannels and tiny briefs instead of the great big underpants of the patriarch. Self treats us to the full gush and steam of his father's horse-like piss and, of course, we get to see the father's phallus: a \"stubby ... pink, glittering dome\". </p> <p>Acknowledging that his father was \"an inadequate specimen of manhood\", Self attributes his own nebulous masculinity to a lack of alternative role models. In so doing he readily concurs with Susan Faludi's thesis in Stiffed - the almanac for unmanned men - that today's males feel betrayed, \"profoundly unfathered\", short-changed: at work, in the family and in society at large. For Self, the problem with contemporary masculinity is that it doesn't know what it wants: \"A makeover or an undoing, a retread or a retrenchment?\" Masculinity is in a bizarre limbo, a remembrance of testosterone past when the avatar was the breadwinner with worker's hands, a long-term contract and a life-long relationship. </p> <p>Annoyingly, at times Self plays the writer's joker, the Dostoevskian \"I'm not like other men\". Yet surely the point is: who among us is? His avowal that he has never hung out with men who are \"in the habit of either asking or telling each other what their genitals are like\" is disingenuous, considering that he has just given us a graphic description of his father's penis (not to mention the subject matter of his early novella, Cock). Self wants to play the man and the not-man, and all the shadows in between - but, again, that is what we all do; gender is a performance, as he lucidly acknowledges. Manhood resides in exchange, in dialogue, in relationships, in gestures and expressions. </p> <p>For his take on contemporary masculinity and the legacy of 1970s feminism Self turns to the transsexual community and someone who had to fight to become a man. Born female, Stephen Whittle is a lecturer in law at Manchester University specialising in transgender issues. After years of gender dysphoria, cross-dressing, bullying and suicidal frustration, Whittle decided to make the transition. Whether clothes make or mistake the man, he bought himself a shirt and tie and started passing as male. </p> <p>The words in this section of the book are Whittle's own. Self is merely the facilitator and editor of Whittle's discourse, which was recorded in several meetings between the two. Indeed, Whittle's words have been preserved to such an extent that the initial flurry of \"you know\" \"sort of\" and \"um\" is obtrusive. But his story is disturbing, poignant and empowering. He continually stresses the performative and imitative nature of gender: from the initial binding of his breasts to taking testosterone, growing a beard and having a mastectomy and hysterectomy. All this happened in 1978, when transsexuals were barely tolerated in the community (or by the NHS). </p> <p>Again, parents were problematic. His proud, military father didn't want to engage with such embarrassing issues, while his mother wouldn't stop crying whenever Stephen tried to explain his predicament. Siblings were similarly uncertain. If one of the slogans of 1970s feminism was that \"biology isn't destiny\", then Whittle's visceral narrative shows us the intimidating cultural conditions he was up against: the binary classification of gender, the lack of understanding, the constant fear that he would be discovered as a woman. Two individuals assured his progress: a very determined and sympathetic GP who risked her job to help his cause; and Sarah, the woman he fell in love with, the mother of their four children and the person who finally allowed him to make the shift \"from being just masculine to being a man\". </p> <p>Like Faludi, Whittle sees masculinity in crisis, \"inherently devalued ... through feminist discussion, theory and argument\", yet perhaps much of that discussion paved the way for the alternative household he now enjoys. Also, is it really such a bad thing that masculinity has been stripped of its worst assumptions? Surely the concern should be where to go next? Like Self, Whittle sees a dearth of real alternatives to the anachronistic notions of manhood, and it's a space all too easily colonised by media constructs: new man, new lad, new ways to get you to buy into an identity that ultimately isn't you or, for that matter, new. </p> <p>Perhaps we should now be thinking about gender issues in terms of their manipulation by consumerist PR. Naomi Klein's No Logo argues persuasively that identity politics play into the hands of big business: they are too easily assimilated, repackaged and sold back to us. Only an appreciation and acceptance of the fluidity of gender will allow identities which, like Stephen Whittle's, are subtle and individual enough to challenge such manipulation. </p> <p>Ultimately, this book shows us men that we are all, to some extent, perfidious males. With varying levels of efficacy, we are endeavouring to conform to media stereotypes of manhood or else struggling to fashion a more authentic and supple identity, one that challenges false binaries and boundaries. In this respect, Stephen Whittle's story should give us all the courage to be ourselves.</p>",

He continually stresses the performative and imitative nature of gender: from the initial binding of his breasts to taking testosterone, growing a beard and having a mastectomy and hysterectomy. All this happened in 1978, when transsexuals were barely tolerated in the community (or by the NHS). Again, parents were problematic. His proud, military father didn't want to engage with such embarrassing issues, while his mother wouldn't stop crying whenever Stephen tried to explain his predicament. Siblings were similarly uncertain. If one of the slogans of 1970s feminism was that \"biology isn't destiny\", then Whittle's visceral narrative shows us the intimidating cultural conditions he was up against: the binary classification of gender, the lack of understanding, the constant fear that he would be discovered as a woman. Two individuals assured his progress: a very determined and sympathetic GP who risked her job to help his cause; and Sarah, the woman he fell in love with, the mother of their four children and the person who finally allowed him to make the shift \"from being just masculine to being a man\". Like Faludi, Whittle sees masculinity in crisis, \"inherently devalued ... through feminist discussion, theory and argument\", yet perhaps much of that discussion paved the way for the alternative household he now enjoys. Also, is it really such a bad thing that masculinity has been stripped of its worst assumptions? Surely the concern should be where to go next? Like Self, Whittle sees a dearth of real alternatives to the anachronistic notions of manhood, and it's a space all too easily colonised by media constructs: new man, new lad, new ways to get you to buy into an identity that ultimately isn't you or, for that matter, new. Perhaps we should now be thinking about gender issues in terms of their manipulation by consumerist PR. Naomi Klein's No Logo argues persuasively that identity politics play into the hands of big business: they are too easily assimilated, repackaged and sold back to us. Only an appreciation and acceptance of the fluidity of gender will allow identities which, like Stephen Whittle's, are subtle and individual enough to challenge such manipulation. Ultimately, this book shows us men that we are all, to some extent, perfidious males. With varying levels of efficacy, we are endeavouring to conform to media stereotypes of manhood or else struggling to fashion a more authentic and supple identity, one that challenges false binaries and boundaries. In this respect, Stephen Whittle's story should give us all the courage to be ourselves.",

And according to Nelly, it fitted perfectly the \"atmospheric tumult\" that often surrounded the bleak moorland hill-top on which the house was built. </p> <p>\"Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed; one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of the few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.\" </p> <p>Most authorities place Wuthering Heights at Top Withins, a ruined farmstead sheltered today not by firs but by two gnarled sycamores, on the moors to the west of the pretty, West Yorkshire town of Haworth, the centre of the Bront\u00eb industry. So great is the international interest in this strange and intense family that some of the footpath signs on this walk are in Japanese. </p> <p>The grey, cobbled town of Haworth was where the Rev Patrick Bront\u00eb brought his family of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell, in 1809, when he took up the curacy of the parish church. He could not have guessed that Haworth's setting, surrounded by the forbidding moors of the South Pennines, would have inspired such an extraordinary flowering of literary talent. </p> <p>This week's walk starts from the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum car park, going through the gateposts opposite the museum and turning right. The lane soon becomes a paved field path which leads up to West Lane. Turn left along the road and, after about 80 yards, take a left fork, on the lane signposted to Penistone Hill. </p> <p>When you reach the junc tion with Moor Side Lane, take the stone-walled track straight ahead, signposted the Bront\u00eb Way and Top Withins. This track, boggy in places, contours across The Slack with the Lower Laithe reservoir below, and passes several deserted farmsteads as it gradually descends to South Dean Beck. </p> <p>The Bront\u00ebs often took long walks near their home at the Parsonage, up the steep valley of the Sladen and South Dean Beck, across the cloughs and dikes to the brooding, windswept moors above. </p> <p>Charlotte's friend Ellen Nussey sometimes accompanied them, and she later described the experience: \"One long ramble made in these early days was far away over the moors to a spot familiar to Emily and Anne, which they called 'The Meeting of the Waters.' It was a small oasis of emerald green turf, broken here and there by small clear springs: a few large stones served as resting places; seated here, we were hidden from all the world, nothing appearing in view but miles and miles of heather, a glorious blue sky, and brightening sun.\" </p> <p>South Dean Beck is crossed by the clapper Bront\u00eb Bridge, while upstream to the left are the pretty Bront\u00eb Falls - Emily's \"Meeting of the Waters\". Nearby, a natural gritstone boulder shaped like a chair - perhaps one of Ellen Nussey's \"resting places\" - is inevitably known as the Bront\u00eb Seat. </p> <p>From here, the path leads steeply uphill, signposted \"Top Withins\". Follow the South Dean Beck over Sandy Hill and past deserted, circular sheepfolds until the dark, truncated shape of Top Withins comes into view. Crossing the beck, and passing two more deserted farms also called Withins you meet the Pennine Way \"motorway,\" coming in from the right. Top Withins stands at nearly 1,400ft and there can be no doubt, especially at this time of the year, that it merits the epithet \"wuthering\". </p> <p>A plaque erected by the Bront\u00eb Society states honestly that the buildings, even when complete, bore no resemblance to the house Emily described in the novel, \"but the situation may have been in her mind when she wrote of the moorland setting of the Heights.\" </p> <p>Turn right and follow the now-paved Pennine Way north, down over Scar and Flaight Hill past the white-painted Upper Heights Farm. Bear left here, still on the Pennine Way, past Lower Heights Farm, and where the Way veers left after about 500 yards, go straight ahead on the track signposted to Stanbury and Haworth. </p> <p>As you enter Stanbury, bear right, then take the first road on the right, signposted to Oxenhope, to cross the dam of the Lower Laithe reservoir. Immediately beyond the dam, turn left on a road which turns into a track as it climbs up to meet the road by Haworth cemetery. You now retrace your steps back into Haworth by walking left along the road, and across the stile to follow the paved field path back into the town. </p> <p>Of all the sisters, it was Emily who was the most affected by the wildness of the moors, and it certainly shows in Wuthering Heights, which captures the untamed character of the moors. In her preface to the 1850 edition, (published under the nom de plume of Ellis Bell), her sister Charlotte tried to explain the influence the moors had on Emily: \"Ellis Bell did not describe as one whose eye and taste alone found pleasure in the prospect; her native hills were far more to her than a spectacle; they were what she lived in, and by, as much as the wild birds, their tenants, or as the heather, their produce.\" </p> <p>Charlotte also wrote later: \"My sister Emily loved the moors . . . She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights; and not the least and best-loved was - liberty.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Haworth is just off the A6033, about two miles south of Keighley. The walk is about 7 miles long and involves about 500ft of gradual ascent, mainly on well-defined moorland paths, some of which are paved, but you should take, boots and waterproofs. The Ordnance Survey's 1:25,000 Outdoor Leisure Map No 21, covering the South Pennines, is recommended reading. Stanbury has a couple of excellent pubs at a convenient point on the walk: the award-winning Old Silent Inn (01535 647437), which also does bed and breakfast and serves some of the best food in Yorkshire, and the Wuthering Heights (formerly The Cross) Inn, (01535 643332). Haworth's tourist information centre is in West Lane (01535 642329), and this weekend (Dec 23-24) sees Haworth's \"Christmas Cracker\" event, when the all the shopkeepers dress in Victorian costumes and Morris dancers, choirs and bands, including the Bavarian Oompah Band, perform in the steeply-cobbled Main Street.</p>",

He could not have guessed that Haworth's setting, surrounded by the forbidding moors of the South Pennines, would have inspired such an extraordinary flowering of literary talent. This week's walk starts from the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum car park, going through the gateposts opposite the museum and turning right. The lane soon becomes a paved field path which leads up to West Lane. Turn left along the road and, after about 80 yards, take a left fork, on the lane signposted to Penistone Hill. When you reach the junc tion with Moor Side Lane, take the stone-walled track straight ahead, signposted the Bront\u00eb Way and Top Withins. This track, boggy in places, contours across The Slack with the Lower Laithe reservoir below, and passes several deserted farmsteads as it gradually descends to South Dean Beck. The Bront\u00ebs often took long walks near their home at the Parsonage, up the steep valley of the Sladen and South Dean Beck, across the cloughs and dikes to the brooding, windswept moors above. Charlotte's friend Ellen Nussey sometimes accompanied them, and she later described the experience: \"One long ramble made in these early days was far away over the moors to a spot familiar to Emily and Anne, which they called 'The Meeting of the Waters.' It was a small oasis of emerald green turf, broken here and there by small clear springs: a few large stones served as resting places; seated here, we were hidden from all the world, nothing appearing in view but miles and miles of heather, a glorious blue sky, and brightening sun.\" South Dean Beck is crossed by the clapper Bront\u00eb Bridge, while upstream to the left are the pretty Bront\u00eb Falls - Emily's \"Meeting of the Waters\". Nearby, a natural gritstone boulder shaped like a chair - perhaps one of Ellen Nussey's \"resting places\" - is inevitably known as the Bront\u00eb Seat. From here, the path leads steeply uphill, signposted \"Top Withins\". Follow the South Dean Beck over Sandy Hill and past deserted, circular sheepfolds until the dark, truncated shape of Top Withins comes into view. Crossing the beck, and passing two more deserted farms also called Withins you meet the Pennine Way \"motorway,\" coming in from the right. Top Withins stands at nearly 1,400ft and there can be no doubt, especially at this time of the year, that it merits the epithet \"wuthering\". A plaque erected by the Bront\u00eb Society states honestly that the buildings, even when complete, bore no resemblance to the house Emily described in the novel, \"but the situation may have been in her mind when she wrote of the moorland setting of the Heights.\" Turn right and follow the now-paved Pennine Way north, down over Scar and Flaight Hill past the white-painted Upper Heights Farm. Bear left here, still on the Pennine Way, past Lower Heights Farm, and where the Way veers left after about 500 yards, go straight ahead on the track signposted to Stanbury and Haworth. As you enter Stanbury, bear right, then take the first road on the right, signposted to Oxenhope, to cross the dam of the Lower Laithe reservoir. Immediately beyond the dam, turn left on a road which turns into a track as it climbs up to meet the road by Haworth cemetery. You now retrace your steps back into Haworth by walking left along the road, and across the stile to follow the paved field path back into the town. Of all the sisters, it was Emily who was the most affected by the wildness of the moors, and it certainly shows in Wuthering Heights, which captures the untamed character of the moors. In her preface to the 1850 edition, (published under the nom de plume of Ellis Bell), her sister Charlotte tried to explain the influence the moors had on Emily: \"Ellis Bell did not describe as one whose eye and taste alone found pleasure in the prospect; her native hills were far more to her than a spectacle; they were what she lived in, and by, as much as the wild birds, their tenants, or as the heather, their produce.\" Charlotte also wrote later: \"My sister Emily loved the moors . . . She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights; and not the least and best-loved was - liberty.\" The practicals Haworth is just off the A6033, about two miles south of Keighley. The walk is about 7 miles long and involves about 500ft of gradual ascent, mainly on well-defined moorland paths, some of which are paved, but you should take, boots and waterproofs. The Ordnance Survey's 1:25,000 Outdoor Leisure Map No 21, covering the South Pennines, is recommended reading. Stanbury has a couple of excellent pubs at a convenient point on the walk: the award-winning Old Silent Inn (01535 647437), which also does bed and breakfast and serves some of the best food in Yorkshire, and the Wuthering Heights (formerly The Cross) Inn, (01535 643332). Haworth's tourist information centre is in West Lane (01535 642329), and this weekend (Dec 23-24) sees Haworth's \"Christmas Cracker\" event, when the all the shopkeepers dress in Victorian costumes and Morris dancers, choirs and bands, including the Bavarian Oompah Band, perform in the steeply-cobbled Main Street.",

      "body": "<p>There are white beaches with sand as fine as caster sugar, pale blue seas, amazing corals and fish, lagoons, mountains, rivers, rice terraces and bright, bright stars. The Philippines has almost everything a holidaymaker could desire, yet it is barely on the tourist map and is seldom visited by the British. Even though it is probably the most westernised eastern nation, where English is spoken readily, this diverse archipelago has yet to find its feet in terms of tourism. </p> <p>It is the place many say was the real inspiration for Alex Garland's The Beach (the author lived and travelled there) and there are lots of wondrous beaches that fit his idyllic descriptions. For those who now find Thailand too overrun with the disciples of Garland, DiCaprio or the Lonely Planet guides, then the Philippines could be the place. </p> <p>The thousands of islands that make up the country are split into three groups: the Visayas, Luzon and Mindanao. The latter is out of bounds for all but the most irresponsible of travellers because of the current propensity for Muslim guerrillas to pick tourists off the beach. </p> <p>We chose to stay in the Visayas, an easily negotiable region for the two weeks that we had, and headed for Malapascua Island. I had read in one of those best-beaches-of-the-world-type surveys, that: \"If there were a holy grail of beaches, it would probably be found in the Philippines. In a country that is made up of 7,107 islands, good beaches are not hard to come by. Malapascua Island is one of the finest examples - a mere speck in the ocean maybe but its Bounty Beach, replete with blindingly white sand and looming palms, is truly sensuous.\" </p> <p>Malapascua Island lies 8km north-east of Cebu, which is the most tourist-oriented and most visited of the Visayas islands. It takes three and a half hours by bus on a good day (it will most likely take longer) plus a further 45 minutes on a fast outrigger boat. Sitting on the wooden seats of the outrigger, it became clear that we could wait for three hours or more for the boat to fill up - it doesn't leave until a full complement of passengers gets on board, whatever time it is. You can, however, pay extra and have yourself transported to the island for the fare of around 15 passengers, which is about a fiver. </p> <p>You can walk around the whole of Malapascua in less than two hours. There's a strip of bright, white sand named Bounty Beach, which is lined with basic cottages and hammocks dotted between the palms. There are a few restaurants, a floating bar, a couple of dive shops and a few dozen fishing boats. </p> <p>In one of the tiny, empty bays, we stumbled across Paul Foley, an Oxford graduate who gave up the pressures of the advertising business to bum around a bit, earning money as a divemaster and instructor. The diving on Malapascua is simple: under the ledges of Gato Island, you can slide down and watch white-tipped reef sharks as they sleep while blue-spotted rays nestle nearby. </p> <p>The trip back from Malapascua gave an idea of just how haphazard travelling within the Philippines can be. We had been diving and had planned for the boat to drop us off at Da'anbantyan on the Cebu mainland. The five o'clock bus was supposed to leave from there. But when we stepped up from the boat, the man with the densely-tattooed legs laughed and said there was no bus. He then rode off in a motorised tricycle to fetch a Jeepney (the most common form of travel in the Philippines, it is a sort of open-ended bus made out of an old US army Jeep, often brightly decorated, plastered with stickers and all kinds of add-ons like horns, lights, tinsel, holy statues) which would take us to Bogo. </p> <p>The Jeepney driver chuckled at the idea of two women travelling without husbands. With our wedding fingers free of gold bands and clearly past what the Filipinos regard as marrying age, we were gaped at in awe by almost everyone and asked why we weren't married. </p> <p>As we sat upfront and boasted about our recent encounter with sharks, Janus, the jeepney driver, smiled and said: \"I am glad they didn't eated you.\" Then the Jeepney - running on a dodgy battery - clapped out in the middle of the road. Janus knew he could lose half the fare, but it seemed it would take more than time to fix. There was nothing else for it, so we hailed a motorised tricycle and hared off to catch the Bogo bus. Two hours and about 20p later, we arrived. </p> <p>From Cebu, we travelled to Boracay, a blissful island that became a favourite with Elizabeth Taylor. For the itinerant traveller/backpacker who would be happier camping on a desert island, it is not the best place. But it is pretty good for the holiday-maker who wants wonderful beaches, sailing, horses to ride, laid-back bars and a cheesy disco. </p> <p>Getting to Boracay involves a flight to Kalibo and then a bus to the ferry, from which you eventually have to wade ashore through warm, pale-blue water. Men eagerly await your arrival and will hoist your bag up on their shoulder and carry it ashore so it doesn't get wet. They can hoist you on their shoulders, too, for a few pesos more. </p> <p>Boracay is a lazy place, and its downside is that it is on the cusp of over-development. But walk away from the main tourist areas on White Beach, up to the very end and you will find empty spaces. Take the Red Pirates catamaran round the island for a secluded barbecue or go horseriding to private nooks and crannies and the idea of over-development soon fades away. </p> <p>Our next destination was Palawan, but to get there we had to overnight in Manila. Since we had so little time in the country, the hassle of Manila was the last thing we wanted. Instead, we quickly flew round a shopping mall picking up shoes that Imelda Marcos would have no doubt killed us for. </p> <p>The Philippines may have a fascinating history - claimed for Spain and named after King Phillip II by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521; dominated by America from 1898; occupied by the Japanese during the second world war. And they have an interesting make-up - Malay in origin with traces of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood; mostly Catholic but with many Muslims and Buddhists. Yet the thing people know most about the country is Imelda Marcos and her shoes. </p> <p>Palawan is the country's largest province, with more than 1,000 islands and islets of its own. Known as the last frontier because its nearest neighbour is North Borneo, it is famous for its dramatic cliffs, where men climb to precarious heights to pluck - for a hefty price of around $3,000 per kilo - the famous edible swiftlet's nests used in bird's nest soup. </p> <p>Our first stop in Palawan was the Dos Palmas resort on Arreceffi island, a nature resort with sporting facilities. Marketed as a centre of ecotourism, it had the rather disconcerting feature of caged white-tip sharks swimming around under the stilt-built reception area. </p> <p>But it was from the window of a 19-seater plane that we caught the real glory of Palawan as we skirted over tiny islands that looked like giant, white-edged crocodiles swimming in an azure sea. We were heading towards El Nido, in Bacuit Bay, which is dominated by karst limestone formations that thrust upwards from the sea. Secret Beach, on Matinloc Island, can only be reached by snorkelling through a small crack in the limestone walls. </p> <p>We stayed in an exquisitely furnished water cottage on Lagen Island, our patio doors opening out on to a small lagoon and a view of the limestone cliffs beyond, and we spent the days diving, kayaking, climbing, sunbathing and looking at the stars. Over a bottle of locally-brewed San Miguel, we shook our heads. \"This is perfect,\" said my friend, Karen. \"I hope too many people don't discover the Philippines too soon.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Singapore Airlines (0870 6088886, <a href=\"http://www.singapore air.com\">www.singapore air.com</a>) has one flight a day London-Manila from \u00a3530 return. The best time to go is between November and May, though we travelled in June and were lucky with the weather. </p> <p><strong> Malapascua:</strong> Buses leave at regular intervals from locations in Cebu City. Regular buses cost 45PhP (60p) while air-conditioned buses cost 70PhP. Pump boats leave from Maya to Malapascua and cost 15PhP per passenger. Special trips can be arranged for around 300PhP.

      "body": "<p>Real mountains are few and far between in Britain, but should you decide to take your mountain bike into what little wild country we have, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the fine off-road riding. </p> <p>In the south-east, there's the North and South Downs and the Chilterns, while areas such as North Wales, the Lake District and Scotland can provide you with rides almost as good as those in the Alps. </p> <p>The major hassles will be deep mud and incessant winds, especially in winter, but the worst of both can be avoided with a bit of common sense (in the case of mud, ride somewhere else; in the case of wind, try to choose a route where it will be behind you). </p> <p>You also need to be aware of where you can and can't ride - ramblers will turn as red as their socks if you hurtle past them on a public footpath, so remember that you can only cycle on public bridleways, Roads Used as Public Paths (RUPPS) and Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATS). </p> <p>The following routes are a sample of some of the best riding in the UK. All of them can be followed with 1:50,000 OS Landranger maps or 1:25,000 OS Outdoor Leisure maps. </p> <p><strong> Alfriston, South Downs</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 15.5 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: moderate (OS Landranger maps 198 &amp; 199)</strong> </p> <p> This route at the eastern end of the South Downs has great views of the Sussex countryside and coastline, and even in winter the ride rarely gets too muddy (although exposed patches of chalk are very slippery when wet). An easy detour just to the north of the route will take you to a Neolithic chalk figure known as the Long Man. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> You ride through open, rolling fields and attractive woodland, and beside the estuary of the River Cuckmere. From the village of Jevington, climb steeply over the Downs then descend to Alfriston, from where you climb again before turning south at Bostal Hill down to the Cuckmere Estuary. A third climb takes you up Snap Hill, then on to Lullington Heath National Nature Reserve before dropping back down to Jevington. </p> <p><strong> Crowcombe, Quantock Hills</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 23 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Difficulty: hard (OS Landranger map 182)</strong> </p> <p> The Quantock Hills have a great selection of sandy dirt tracks with commanding views over the Bristol Channel to South Wales. There are several loops that take you down into the steep, thickly-wooded \"combes\" beneath the hills. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> Take the minor road from Crowcombe to Crowcombe Park Gate from where you ride north-west on excellent dirt tracks along the main ridge of the Quantock Hills. Above the village of West Quantoxhead, descend steeply down Smith's Combe. You then go up and down several combes between Holford and Over Stowey before returning to the starting point. There are plenty of opportunities to cut the ride short if the climbs become too much, but it's almost as easy to take a break in the woodlands, where you may see deer grazing, or to relax on the hilltops and admire the views of Somerset and Wales. </p> <p><strong> Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 24.5 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: hard </strong></p> <p><strong>(OS Outdoor Leisure map 19)</strong> </p> <p> From the idiosyncratic mill town of Hebden Bridge, you climb through a beautiful woodland valley on to open moorland more than 1,000ft up on the edge of Bront\u00eb country. From the moors, there's a fast and furious descent into Lancashire, from where you return on an ancient packhorse route back to Yorkshire. You won't see owt much other than wind-blasted moors, dark-watered dams and sheltered woodlands - and maybe another mountain biker or two. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> From Hebden Bridge, ride up to the National Trust's Hardcastle Crags, where you climb through woodlands on to the Pennines and ride past Widdop Reservoir to follow the long, fast, bumpy Gorple Road (a dirt track despite the name) down to Worsthorne. From here, it's a road ride through Mereclough and up to Long Causeway, then along a series of bridleways and minor roads past New Delight Inn and Blackshaw Head before descending steeply to Hebden Bridge. </p> <p><strong> Swaledale, Yorkshire Dales</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 17.5 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: moderate/hard </strong></p> <p><strong>(OS Outdoor Leisure Map 30)</strong> </p> <p> Swaledale is one of Yorkshire's most beautiful valleys, and this ride gives you great views from easily-navigated tracks criss-crossing the moorlands. The area was an important lead-mining region in the 18th and 19th centuries, and most of the tracks here were built to access the remote moorland mines. The tracks are well drained so even in the wettest weather doesn't them excessively boggy. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> From the village of Low Fremlington, climb steeply north to the hamlet of Hurst, where you turn sharp left across the moors before an exhilarating descent to Arkle Beck and Langthwaite. You then climb to Arkle Town before following a track across the moor and down to the ford at Fore Gill Gate (if you recognise it, you probably saw it on the credits to All Creatures Great and Small). From the ford, follow the miner's track in a loop over Reeth High Moors and back down to Surrender Bridge, then take the minor road and B6270 back to Healaugh, Reeth and Low Fremlington. </p> <p><strong> High Street, Lake District</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 22 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: extreme </strong></p> <p><strong>(OS Outdoor Leisure Map 5)</strong> </p> <p> This ride starts with a 2,100ft climb, the majority of which is unrideable and thus defeats the whole purpose of mountain biking. So why do it? Because once you reach the summit of High Raise (2,631ft) at the eastern end of the High Street Range, you get stupendous views across the north-eastern fells and lakes, and a mind-blowing ride along the Roman road of High Street for five miles, followed by a zinging descent to Ullswater. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> From Hartsop, ride, push, carry and curse your way for almost four miles to High Raise. After a long pause to recover and admire the view, ride north-west along the Roman road to Loadpot Hill, where a fast descent takes you to Howtown on the north shore of Ullswater. The route then skirts Hallin Fell to follow the lake shore to Patterdale, then the A592 back to Hartsop. </p> <p><strong> High Lodge Forest Centre, Thetford Forest, Norfolk</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Terrain: easy</strong> </p> <p> Stopped laughing yet? Okay, the Norfolk countryside may be to mountain biking what Holland is to downhill skiing, but if you're stuck in the flatlands of East Anglia, this is as good as it gets. For families or first-time mountain bikers, the marked cycle trails that loop out into the forest from High Lodge Forest Centre, near Brandon, are an excellent introduction to the sport - all the climbs and descents are gentle and never more than about 100ft in height. </p> <p>For experienced mountain bikers, it can all be rather tame, but if you look upon a ride here as a training run for the real thing, you'll probably enjoy it. </p> <p><strong> Coed-y-Brenin Forest Centre, North Wales</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distances: 8, 15.5 and 23.6 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: Easy to hard</strong> </p> <p> The three waymarked trails at Coed-y-Brenin Forest Centre, near Dolgellau, have been designed by mountain bikers. There are routes to suit everyone from families to hardened off-roaders, and they all pass through magnificent mountain and forest scenery. The shortest trail is the Red Bull Trail (8 miles), which has some demanding single track sections, while the MBR trail (15.5 miles) is an enjoyable route with useful short cuts, and the Karrimor Trail (23.6 miles) is the hardest and provides a good workout for anyone. </p> <p>The centre has a caf\u00e9 (weekends only November to April), shop, bike hire and bike wash, and is a great place to hang out, meet fellow mountain bikers and get a few tips on other places to ride. The only charge for using the trails is \u00a31 for the car park. For more details, call 01341 440666. </p> <p><strong> The Elan Valley, Mid-Wales </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 22 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: hard </strong></p> <p><strong>(OS Landranger Map 147)</strong> </p> <p> The remote centre of Wales is a mini Lake District with more sheep and red kites than people. There are some good tracks around the impressive dams of the Elan Valley (built in the 19th and 20th centuries to provide Birmingham with water) and over the surrounding moorlands, and most routes are rideable year-round. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> From Rhayader, ride to Caban-coch Reservoir and cross the bridge separating Caban-coch from Garreg-du Reservoir. Follow the road to the dam wall of Claerwen Reservoir, from where you turn back on yourself to climb a bridleway over the moors back to Caban-coch. You then ride along the north shore of Garreg-du and Penygarreg Reservoirs before a stiff climb over the moorland of Esgair Perfedd to the Aberystwyth Mountain Road. Cross this and follow another bridleway for a spectacular descent back to Rhayader. </p> <p><strong> Loch Eck, Strathclyde</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: 23 miles </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: moderate </strong></p> <p><strong>(OS Landranger Map 56)</strong> </p> <p> This ride around the shores of Loch Eck at the southern end of the Highlands is a good introduction to Scottish mountain biking. It passes steel blue waters, forests and mountains rising up to 2,500ft, and you may see golden eagles. There are a couple of steep and sustained climbs, but overall it's not a particularly hard route. </p> <p> <strong> The route: </strong> From the Whistlefield Inn on the east shore of Loch Eck, there's a steep climb up into forest, then back down to follow the A815 to the south end of the loch (where there's a caf\u00e9 at Younger Botanic Gardens and the tallest trees in Scotland). From here, a good forest road leads almost 10 miles to the north end of the loch, where a long, steep climb takes you high into forest again and back to the starting point. </p> <p>(Trying to choose the \"best\" mountain bike ride in Scotland is like trying to choose the \"best\" mountain in the Himalayas, so if you want more information on where to ride, contact the Scottish Tourist Board on 0131-332 2433 <a href=\"http://www.visitscotland.net\">www.visitscotland.net</a>). </p> <p><strong> Gortin Glens Forest Park, Omagh</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Distance: Two trails, three miles each </strong></p> <p><strong>Terrain: easy and moderate</strong> </p> <p> The park in County Tyrone has two short waymarked circuits located just south of the Sperrin Mountains. The trails provide excellent views of the plain of Omagh, Mullaghcarn Mountain and Bessy Bell Mountain and its wind farm, and you may spot red squirrels, deer, buzzards and other raptors. </p> <p>Both circuits are very short at a mere three miles, with one catering for families and the other, with a stiffer climb and a good downhill, more suitable for experienced riders. You can do both routes to make a longer circuit. </p> <p>The forest park is located just outside Omagh on the B48 to Gortin, and you can park and start the rides from the Glens Centre at the park, where bike hire is also available.

      "bodyText": "Pressure mounted on the government last night to intervene over the purchase of Express Newspapers by the porn baron Richard Desmond after the chairmen of two influential Commons select committees called for the deal to be referred to the competition commission. Robin Corbett, head of the home affairs committee, said Mr Desmond's pornography interests made him unsuitable to own the papers, while Martin O'Neill, chairman of the trade and industry committee, demanded assurances about their running. The Guardian yesterday revealed the real extent of Mr Desmond's porn interests through a network of interlinked companies including webcams selling \"live\" sex. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, has the power to refer the \u00a3125m acquisition of the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star to the commission on public interest grounds. Downing Street, anxious to secure the support of all three papers at the election, has indicated that Tony Blair does not want a battle with Mr Desmond five months before Labour is likely to go to the polls. Mr Byers would be reluctant to challenge No 10 on such a sensitive issue and recently declared that he wanted to be less involved in mergers. But as details of Mr Desmond's involvement in hard porn emerge, a groundswell is growing against his ownership of newspapers with a combined circulation of 1.6m copies on weekdays. Mr Corbett, a former tabloid journalist, said: \"It cannot be in the public interest that a man with these sleazy business interests is in control of a national newspaper. The dummy directors have guaranteed nothing, as we have seen in the past with the Times. \"He has demonstrated that his standards are well below those of most of the British public and that, in my view, makes him unfit to own a national newspaper.

Crucially, it is expected to concentrate on strict competition issues rather than considering the wider public interest issues. Therefore it may recommend no action. An adviser to the trade secretary said: \"Obviously he still has legal powers, but we have said that as a policy we would normally accept their recommendations.\" Mr Desmond claims that the rights of the newspaper editors have been safeguarded by the creation of an \"independent\" editorial panel. But fears about its effectiveness will increase after Jonathan Holborow, a panel member, last night pulled out of an interview on BBC Radio Five's PaperTalk programme after being told that he would be asked about Mr Desmond's porn business. The other two panel members are Arthur Davidson QC, former legal director of Associated newspapers and once a Labour MP, and Barbara Thomas, a former director of News International. Mr Desmond's opponents believe a precedent was set 10 years ago when David Sullivan, the owner of the lurid Daily Sport, was barred from buying the Bristol Evening Post by the monopolies and mergers commission, the predecessor of the competition commission. In an implied criticism of the prime minister's decision to meet Mr Desmond last week, the former Labour minister Peter Kilfoyle said: \"The idea that such a longstanding title as the Express should end up in the hands of a man who made his money out of porn strikes me as profoundly dangerous.\" Tory MP Peter Bottomley, treasurer of the all-party media group, said: \"I have no doubt that most readers of the Express would, if they knew what it was associated with, be displeased.\"",

The Munich prosecutor's of fice has already said it is looking at possible contraventions of trading laws while several shareholder groups have launched legal challenges against EM.TV. Yesterday, a company spokesman said that it had not been notified of the Bawe investigation but would cooperate fully as it was already doing with the Munich prosecutor. \"Our books are open,\" said the spokesman.",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 It's 18 years since I was there, but organised trekking parties were then in a minority. Most people travelled fairly light with a good guidebook (or a map on the back of an envelope) and stayed at lodges (basically the Nepali version of b&amp;b) which were anything from very basic to reasonably posh. That way you go at your own pace, can stop, turn back, take a detour, meet the people you stay with, meet other travellers and put money straight into the local economy. Lodges are (were?) plentiful on the main routes. Off these I had to resort to knocking on doors a few times, but didn't have any trouble getting a place to sleep, and once got caught up in a local wedding. But perhaps it's all changed...</p> <p>Mat Ridley</p> <p> \u0095 Classic Journeys (33 High Street, Tibshelf, Alfreton, Derbyshire, DE55 5NX, tel: 01773 873497) is concerned about the wellbeing of its porters and also sensitive to the need to protect the local environment and preserve Nepalese cultural traditions and way of life. <br><strong> Richard Willmott</strong></p> <p>&amp;#149 Rinzin Tamang (Yogesh) (GPO Box 8974 CPC 289 Kathmandu, Nepal, <a href=\"http://www.Karmatreks.com\">www.Karmatreks.com</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:yogi-trek@hotmail.com\">yogi-trek@hotmail.com</a>) started his trekking career with one of the well-known companies, and about three years ago set up on his own, realising that a large proportion of the money paid by trekkers never reached local pockets. On my trek, one porter was his friend, the other his brother-in-law. I certainly felt that neither of them was being exploited. All arrangements were made by email or post before leaving the UK, although no payment was made until reaching Nepal, and the cost was less than the rate for similar treks advertised in the UK. <br><strong> Davis Clarke</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Next year, I will be making my fifth trek with Yogesh Tamang. <br><strong>Simon Furze </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Muir's Tours (non-profit), Reading, tel: 0118 9502281 (<a href=\"http://www.nkf-mt.org.uk\">www.nkf-mt.org.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:info@nkf-mt.org.uk\">info@nkf-mt.org.uk</a>). <br>\u0095 The Nepal Trust (Scottish charity), Moray, Scotland, tel: 01343 810358 (<a href=\"http://www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk \">www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk\">admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk</a>). <br>\u0095 Tribes Travel, Suffolk tel: 01728 685971 (<a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk \">www.tribes.co.uk</a>, email: <a href=\"mailto:ctg@tribes.co.uk\">ctg@tribes.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>\u0095 For flight bookings, I recommend North South Travel - a travel agency contributing profits towards support for projects in the developing world.<br><strong> Roy Dey-Graff</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Two years ago, I trekked with Summit Trekking (Summit Hotel [P O Box 1406], Kupondol Height, Lalitpur, Kathmandu, tel: 977 1 525 408, email: summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np). The sherpas were fantastic, and well looked after. The company was booked by Scope for its sponsored treks, which is a recommendation in itself. <br><strong> Doug Stratton </strong></p> <p>\u0095 We had a great holiday this year with Nepalese Trails, Random Cottage, Pentre, Llanfyllin, Powys, SY22 5LE, Wales, tel: 01691 648851, email: <a href=\"mailto:neptrail@hotmail.com\"> neptrail@hotmail.com</a>. Barry and Bridget are very caring of their porters, many of whom have been with them for years. They speak the language and support local schools and many other projects. They pay the top \"going rate\" for porters, and ensure they have good footwear and clothing, as well as a proper place to stay each night. They use lodges, where possible, rather than camping, to ensure money spent goes to the local people. <br><strong> Keith and Pat Williams </strong></p> <p> \u0095Every trekker with Nepalese Trails has their own individual porter to carry a bag which must weigh no more than 15kg. With so many porters, everyone can walk at their own pace. And they are very competitively priced. <br><strong> Marnie Sweet </strong></p> <p>\u0095 Nepalese Trails has a passion for Nepal and its people. Their porters have become their friends, and are treated with great care and respect. <br><strong> Cath Webley </strong></p> <p>\u0095 The U3A Travel Network, which organises educational and cultural tours for its members, has used a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung <a href=\"mailto:ramp@bharat.wlink.com.np\"> ramp@bharat.wlink.com.np</a>) who uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara. <br><strong> Dennis Johnson </strong></p> <p> \u0095 Tenji Sherpa is the ideal soluation. Tenji is one of several brothers who have formed a small family trekking company based in Kathmandu, called Sherpa Brothers. You can contact him at <a href=\"mailto:tsherpa@mos.com.np\">tsherpa@mos.com.np</a> and discuss your requirements. He can arrange everything and in all probability will accompany you on the trek, hence no middlemen. He and I recently trekked in the Solu Khumbu, and largely due to his care and expertise, I had a memorable, inexpensive time among his own Sherpa people. <br><strong> Al Parrott</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I belong to the U3A Travel Network which organises educational and cultural tours for its members. The group has run tours in Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan using a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung. I met Ram earlier this year when I was in Kathmandu and he is knowledgeable and flexible. He uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara and will tailor a tour to suit anyone, and is prepared to organise tours anywhere on the Indian sub-continent. <br><strong>Dennis Johnson</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Narayan Gurung took us on a marvellous trek in Nepal a couple of years ago and we are still in touch. He speaks excellent English and can be reached by email at <a href=\"mailto:lalman@wlink.com.np\"> lalman@wlink.com.np</a>. Alternatively his address is GPO Box 11629, Kathmandu, Nepal. You don't need to use a trekking company to trek around much of Nepal. Most of the main trekking routes have plenty of accommodation available, and by using it you are putting money into the local economy. For the Everest trek, just get the bus from Kathmandu to Jiri, then employ local porters who can be hired on the spot from nearby villages, for wages that we would consider derisory. Try the village of Kenja, a day's walk from Jiri where the Everest trek starts. Walk there yourself or send a messenger. By employing people from the villages, you give new opportunities and much needed cash to some of the poorest people on earth. It's all cheaper and easier than you think; food and accommodation are available everywhere and the route is simple to follow. You just need someone to carry your kit. Get good maps and a guidebook; travel light and don't demand too many western 'luxuries'. Finally, don't be tempted to shorten the distance by flying to Lukla. Walk there instead, it will get you fit and acclimatise you gradually, thus avoiding the potential for altitude sickness. <br><strong>Rob Widders</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I would highly recommend a Canadian trekking company called Everest Trekking owned by Gord Konantz. The company organizes treks through Nepal and Tibet. Gord and his wife Gail are usually present on most of the treks. The Nepal operations are run by Tashi Sherpa, a professional mountain climber who lives with his family in Kathmandu. I travelled with Everest Trekking three years ago through the Annapurna area. We were asked to bring any used clothing we had along with us, so that it could be distributed among the sherpas and guides after our trek. The guides were thrilled with this. Check out their website at <a href=\"http://www.everesttrekking.com\" target=\"_neW\"> www.everesttrekking.com</a>. It provides further information on their community work in Nepal. <br><strong>Ann Pawluk</strong></p> <p> \u0095 We did exactly this a few months ago. We booked our trekking and other activities (including local transport, hotels, and visit to Chitwan Park) directly with Gorkha Treks. We gave them outline itinerary and they quoted all inclusive price. Write to Mr DB Gurung, at <a href=\"mailto:dbgurung@mos.com.nep\">dbgurung@mos.com.nep</a>. We were particularly pleased that our porters were not overloaded at any stage of the trek. This was definitely not the case with some other parties we saw. This was a great holiday in a beautiful country with marvellous people - we can't wait to go again! <br><strong>Fred and Jill Brotherton</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I have twice enjoyed a memorable trekking holiday with Roama Travel of Shroton, Blandford, Dorset. It is a small family business (ABTA registered) whose daughter is married to a Nepali with offices in Kathmandu. This year I trekked/camped alone with 10 Nepalis for 12 days and saw only four tourists. Camping is the only way to see Nepal. Avoid the more popular tea house treks that stick to well worn trails. They have no fixed itineraries, but will arrange anything you like. Intimate knowledge of Nepal and all profits go to support charities and schools in Nepal. Contact Bill Norman at <a href=\"mailto:roama@city2000.net\"> roama@city2000.net</a>. <br><strong>David Patten</strong>0</p> <p> \u0095 I can thoroughly recommend a local company - Gurudongma Tours &amp; Treks. It's run by a delightful retired Lieutenant General, Jimmy Singh, and is very efficient and also friendly, ecologically sound and very good to all the staff they employ. Also all your money goes to help local people. They operate all over the Eastern Himalaya. You can contact them on <a href=\"mailto:gurutt@dte.vsnl.net.in\"> gurutt@dte.vsnl.net.in</a>, or at Gurudongma House, Hilltop Road, Kalimpong, West Bengal, India. <br><strong>Maureen Blake</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I have trekked in Nepal twice with Richard and Shari Ravensdale who own Five Valleys Treks and run a small charity, Trekaid, which supports Tibetan refugee villages in Nepal. Their sherpas are employed on a salaried basis all year round, the head sherpa is also a co-director of the firm. Prices are very reasonable, probably partly due to using Aeroflot! Contact at 2 Somerset Cottages, Stoke Village, Plymouth, tel: 01752-567617. <br><strong>Pam Scroop</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I would recommend Joanna contact Lama Parivar, Kay and David White, email <a href=\"mailto:kay@lamaparivar.freeserve.co.uk\"> kay@lamaparivar.freeserve.co.uk</a>. They can arrange treks with either full services, or only a porter and guide. We went on a trek some years ago with them, from Lukla towards Everest, and were impressed by their organisation, which is a joint Anglo/Nepalese one. The Sherpas were part of the team, not exploited labour. Kay White is also raising money and supplies for a village in the mountains.<br><strong>Denis Bates</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I recommend that you contact Carl Harrison, PO Box 2109, Kathmandu, Nepal, email <a href=\"mailto:carl@bighills.wlink.com.np\"> carl@bighills.wlink.com.np</a>. Carl has been organising treks in Nepal for several years and specialises in treks for individuals. <br><strong>Norman Hargreaves</strong></p> <p> \u0095 We recommend Nepalese Trails at Random Cottage, Pentre, Llanfyllin, Powys, SY22 5LE, Wales. Tel: 01691 648851. Email <a href=\"mailto:neptrail@hotmail.com\"> neptrail@hotmail.com</a>. We had a great holiday earlier this year, and Barry and Bridget are very caring of their porters, many of whom have been with them for some years. They speak the language and support local schools and other projects. <br><strong>Keith &amp; Pat Williams</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I can heartily recommend Summit Trekking, based in Kathmandu. I trekked with them two years ago, and found them to be an excellent company. The sherpas were fantastic, and well looked after. The company was booked by Scope for their sponsored treks, which is a recommendation in itself. You will find Summit Trekking at the Summit Hotel (PO Box 1406), Kupondol Height, in the Lalitpur district, or email <a href=\"mailto:summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np\"> summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np</a>. <br><strong>Doug Stratton</strong></p> <p> \u0095 I and several friends have just returned from Nepal. We did all the arranging from this end by email with a Nepali sirdar we had met on a previous trip. We too were concerned about the exploitation - especially of porters who often are poorly equipped for higher altitudes and often totally uninsured by the company. These are concerns that you must sort out before going. Our group of 11 people from the UK flew out with Qatar Airways. All our porters were well equipped and very happy! A trip like this (we climbed a peak in the 22-day trek and then went to North India for a week) doesn't need to cost an arm and a leg - our total was about \u00a31,500 and we didn't rough it. Contact Saroj Neupane of Beyond the Limits Trekking in Kathmandu. Email <a href=\"mailto:blimits@ntc.net.np\"> blimits@ntc.net.np</a>. <br><strong>Chris Walker</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Two years ago, after I retired, my husband and I went on a three-month round-the-world trip, which we organised with the help of Trailfinders. Our final destination was Kathmandu. We weren't fit enough for proper Himalayan two-three week treks but we wanted to walk in the hills around Kathmandu Valley. We had acquired our own driver by chance at the airport, and if he couldn't arrange something for us, he knew someone who could. He took us to Galaxy Trekking and Expedition Ltd on Durbar Marg (it's upstairs so not easily spotted). The staff were very helpful and one spoke excellent English. We booked a two-day 'mini' trek to Nagarkot and back, with a night in a small hotel overlooking the Himalayas, three meals, transport to and from the start and finish point, and a Sherpa guide, Sanu Gurung, just for us. Sanu was patient, courteous without being deferential, informative, with good English and a sense of humour. Our outward trek was only for about 4 hours, with a \"lunch break\" in the middle. We'd only put water and biscuits in our small rucksack with basic overnight things, to keep the weight down, though Sanu insisted on carrying it! We have corresponded with Sanu since, and last year he decided to set up his own company - Naturel and Trekking and Expedition(P) Ltd which also arranges safaris, whitewater rafting etc. The address is PO Box 20560, Thamel, Bhagawati Bahal, Kathmandu, tel 423283 and 4116804, fax: 00977-1-423283, email <a href=\"mailto:natureland@htp.com.np\"> natureland@htp.com.np</a>. <br><strong>Janet Blackburn</strong></p> <p> \u0095 My husband is Nepali, and although now living in England he has worked as a trekking guide in the Annapurna region of Nepal for 10 years. Naturally, he is acutely aware of the issues facing both porters and guides and spent quite some time supporting the rights of porters. We would recommend that the only way to really guarantee the fair treatment of your guides and porters is to communicate directly with them and find out about their pay and conditions and support them further if necessary. We would be very happy to offer you any further information or first hand advice about trekking or travelling in Nepal in general. We can also recommend highly experienced and reliable independent guides to you if you decide to arrange a trek from this country without using an agency. <br><strong>Sam and Guru Sharma</strong> <a href=\"mailto:mountaingurus@yahoo.com\"> mountaingurus@yahoo.com</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 I strongly recommend Yogesh Tamang who arranges tailor-made treks. See <a href=\"http://www.karmartreks.com\" target=\"_neW\"> www.karmartreks.com</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:yogi_trek@hotmail.com\"> yogi_trek@hotmail.com</a>. I am travelling with Yogesh for the fifth time in September for three weeks in the Langtang area.</p> <p> \u0095 I have been trekking three times in Nepal, and recommend Wilderness Experience Pvt. Ltd, GPO. Box 4065, Gyaneshor, Kathmandu, Nepal; tel: 977-1-417832, fax 977-1-417243; email <a href=\"mailto:wildex@ecomail.com.np\"> wildex@ecomail.com.np</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cadvision.com/wilderness\" target=\"_new\"> www.cadvision.com/wilderness</a>. They are experienced, reliable and efficient. <br><strong>John Vernon</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I can thoroughly recommend Nilgiri Treks and Mountaineering if you want to organise a supported trek in Nepal. I have used them twice and am hoping to organise another trek with them in Autumn 2001. Several friends have also used them both for trekking and for climbing. Da Gombu Sherpa is the owner (he is a UIAGM Guide with high altitude experience) and he can be contacted by email at <a href=\"mailto:Chereme@gombu.wlink.com.np\"> Chereme@gombu.wlink.com.np</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 I would like to recommend Pasang Lama as a good reliable guide for trekking in Nepal. Pasang takes great care of the local environment, and makes sure that he spreads trekker's income around, by ensuring that money for food and accommodation goes directly to people in local villages. He also pays his sherpas and porters at well above the minimum rate, ensures they are properly clothed, and that the porters carry less than the recommended amount. Porters and sherpas will also eat the same food as their trekking clients. He can be contacted in Nepal on <a href=\"mailto:plama@plama.wlink.com.np\"> plama@plama.wlink.com.np</a> or in the UK on <a href=\"mailto:mcarrott@lineone.net\"> mcarrott@lineone.net</a>.</p> <p> \u0095 We did a DIY trekking and touring trip to Nepal late last year. Our trek was organised by Lhakpa Sherpa and his UK contact Pat Steel. The organisation was faultless.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 It's 18 years since I was there, but organised trekking parties were then in a minority. Most people travelled fairly light with a good guidebook (or a map on the back of an envelope) and stayed at lodges (basically the Nepali version of b&amp;b) which were anything from very basic to reasonably posh. That way you go at your own pace, can stop, turn back, take a detour, meet the people you stay with, meet other travellers and put money straight into the local economy. Lodges are (were?) plentiful on the main routes. Off these I had to resort to knocking on doors a few times, but didn't have any trouble getting a place to sleep, and once got caught up in a local wedding. But perhaps it's all changed... Mat Ridley \u0095 Classic Journeys (33 High Street, Tibshelf, Alfreton, Derbyshire, DE55 5NX, tel: 01773 873497) is concerned about the wellbeing of its porters and also sensitive to the need to protect the local environment and preserve Nepalese cultural traditions and way of life. Richard Willmott \u2022 Rinzin Tamang (Yogesh) (GPO Box 8974 CPC 289 Kathmandu, Nepal, www.Karmatreks.com, email: yogi-trek@hotmail.com) started his trekking career with one of the well-known companies, and about three years ago set up on his own, realising that a large proportion of the money paid by trekkers never reached local pockets. On my trek, one porter was his friend, the other his brother-in-law. I certainly felt that neither of them was being exploited. All arrangements were made by email or post before leaving the UK, although no payment was made until reaching Nepal, and the cost was less than the rate for similar treks advertised in the UK. Davis Clarke \u0095 Next year, I will be making my fifth trek with Yogesh Tamang. Simon Furze \u0095 Muir's Tours (non-profit), Reading, tel: 0118 9502281 (www.nkf-mt.org.uk, email: info@nkf-mt.org.uk). \u0095 The Nepal Trust (Scottish charity), Moray, Scotland, tel: 01343 810358 (www.thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk, email: admin@thenepaltrust.demon.co.uk). \u0095 Tribes Travel, Suffolk tel: 01728 685971 (www.tribes.co.uk, email: ctg@tribes.co.uk). \u0095 For flight bookings, I recommend North South Travel - a travel agency contributing profits towards support for projects in the developing world. Roy Dey-Graff \u0095 Two years ago, I trekked with Summit Trekking (Summit Hotel [P O Box 1406], Kupondol Height, Lalitpur, Kathmandu, tel: 977 1 525 408, email: summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np). The sherpas were fantastic, and well looked after. The company was booked by Scope for its sponsored treks, which is a recommendation in itself. Doug Stratton \u0095 We had a great holiday this year with Nepalese Trails, Random Cottage, Pentre, Llanfyllin, Powys, SY22 5LE, Wales, tel: 01691 648851, email: neptrail@hotmail.com. Barry and Bridget are very caring of their porters, many of whom have been with them for years. They speak the language and support local schools and many other projects. They pay the top \"going rate\" for porters, and ensure they have good footwear and clothing, as well as a proper place to stay each night. They use lodges, where possible, rather than camping, to ensure money spent goes to the local people. Keith and Pat Williams \u0095Every trekker with Nepalese Trails has their own individual porter to carry a bag which must weigh no more than 15kg. With so many porters, everyone can walk at their own pace. And they are very competitively priced. Marnie Sweet \u0095 Nepalese Trails has a passion for Nepal and its people. Their porters have become their friends, and are treated with great care and respect. Cath Webley \u0095 The U3A Travel Network, which organises educational and cultural tours for its members, has used a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung ramp@bharat.wlink.com.np) who uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara. Dennis Johnson \u0095 Tenji Sherpa is the ideal soluation. Tenji is one of several brothers who have formed a small family trekking company based in Kathmandu, called Sherpa Brothers. You can contact him at tsherpa@mos.com.np and discuss your requirements. He can arrange everything and in all probability will accompany you on the trek, hence no middlemen. He and I recently trekked in the Solu Khumbu, and largely due to his care and expertise, I had a memorable, inexpensive time among his own Sherpa people. Al Parrott \u0095 I belong to the U3A Travel Network which organises educational and cultural tours for its members. The group has run tours in Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan using a tour company in Kathmandu run by an ex-Gurhka called Ram Prasad Gurung. I met Ram earlier this year when I was in Kathmandu and he is knowledgeable and flexible. He uses Gurhka guides from his home town of Pokhara and will tailor a tour to suit anyone, and is prepared to organise tours anywhere on the Indian sub-continent. Dennis Johnson \u0095 Narayan Gurung took us on a marvellous trek in Nepal a couple of years ago and we are still in touch. He speaks excellent English and can be reached by email at lalman@wlink.com.np. Alternatively his address is GPO Box 11629, Kathmandu, Nepal. You don't need to use a trekking company to trek around much of Nepal. Most of the main trekking routes have plenty of accommodation available, and by using it you are putting money into the local economy. For the Everest trek, just get the bus from Kathmandu to Jiri, then employ local porters who can be hired on the spot from nearby villages, for wages that we would consider derisory. Try the village of Kenja, a day's walk from Jiri where the Everest trek starts. Walk there yourself or send a messenger. By employing people from the villages, you give new opportunities and much needed cash to some of the poorest people on earth. It's all cheaper and easier than you think; food and accommodation are available everywhere and the route is simple to follow. You just need someone to carry your kit. Get good maps and a guidebook; travel light and don't demand too many western 'luxuries'. Finally, don't be tempted to shorten the distance by flying to Lukla. Walk there instead, it will get you fit and acclimatise you gradually, thus avoiding the potential for altitude sickness. Rob Widders \u0095 I would highly recommend a Canadian trekking company called Everest Trekking owned by Gord Konantz. The company organizes treks through Nepal and Tibet. Gord and his wife Gail are usually present on most of the treks. The Nepal operations are run by Tashi Sherpa, a professional mountain climber who lives with his family in Kathmandu. I travelled with Everest Trekking three years ago through the Annapurna area. We were asked to bring any used clothing we had along with us, so that it could be distributed among the sherpas and guides after our trek. The guides were thrilled with this. Check out their website at www.everesttrekking.com. It provides further information on their community work in Nepal. Ann Pawluk \u0095 We did exactly this a few months ago. We booked our trekking and other activities (including local transport, hotels, and visit to Chitwan Park) directly with Gorkha Treks. We gave them outline itinerary and they quoted all inclusive price. Write to Mr DB Gurung, at dbgurung@mos.com.nep. We were particularly pleased that our porters were not overloaded at any stage of the trek. This was definitely not the case with some other parties we saw. This was a great holiday in a beautiful country with marvellous people - we can't wait to go again! Fred and Jill Brotherton \u0095 I have twice enjoyed a memorable trekking holiday with Roama Travel of Shroton, Blandford, Dorset. It is a small family business (ABTA registered) whose daughter is married to a Nepali with offices in Kathmandu. This year I trekked/camped alone with 10 Nepalis for 12 days and saw only four tourists. Camping is the only way to see Nepal. Avoid the more popular tea house treks that stick to well worn trails. They have no fixed itineraries, but will arrange anything you like. Intimate knowledge of Nepal and all profits go to support charities and schools in Nepal. Contact Bill Norman at roama@city2000.net. David Patten0 \u0095 I can thoroughly recommend a local company - Gurudongma Tours &amp; Treks. It's run by a delightful retired Lieutenant General, Jimmy Singh, and is very efficient and also friendly, ecologically sound and very good to all the staff they employ. Also all your money goes to help local people. They operate all over the Eastern Himalaya. You can contact them on gurutt@dte.vsnl.net.in, or at Gurudongma House, Hilltop Road, Kalimpong, West Bengal, India. Maureen Blake \u0095 I have trekked in Nepal twice with Richard and Shari Ravensdale who own Five Valleys Treks and run a small charity, Trekaid, which supports Tibetan refugee villages in Nepal. Their sherpas are employed on a salaried basis all year round, the head sherpa is also a co-director of the firm. Prices are very reasonable, probably partly due to using Aeroflot! Contact at 2 Somerset Cottages, Stoke Village, Plymouth, tel: 01752-567617. Pam Scroop \u0095 I would recommend Joanna contact Lama Parivar, Kay and David White, email kay@lamaparivar.freeserve.co.uk. They can arrange treks with either full services, or only a porter and guide. We went on a trek some years ago with them, from Lukla towards Everest, and were impressed by their organisation, which is a joint Anglo/Nepalese one. The Sherpas were part of the team, not exploited labour. Kay White is also raising money and supplies for a village in the mountains. Denis Bates \u0095 I recommend that you contact Carl Harrison, PO Box 2109, Kathmandu, Nepal, email carl@bighills.wlink.com.np. Carl has been organising treks in Nepal for several years and specialises in treks for individuals. Norman Hargreaves \u0095 We recommend Nepalese Trails at Random Cottage, Pentre, Llanfyllin, Powys, SY22 5LE, Wales. Tel: 01691 648851. Email neptrail@hotmail.com. We had a great holiday earlier this year, and Barry and Bridget are very caring of their porters, many of whom have been with them for some years. They speak the language and support local schools and other projects. Keith &amp; Pat Williams \u0095 I can heartily recommend Summit Trekking, based in Kathmandu. I trekked with them two years ago, and found them to be an excellent company. The sherpas were fantastic, and well looked after. The company was booked by Scope for their sponsored treks, which is a recommendation in itself. You will find Summit Trekking at the Summit Hotel (PO Box 1406), Kupondol Height, in the Lalitpur district, or email summtreck@trekking.wlink.com.np. Doug Stratton \u0095 I and several friends have just returned from Nepal. We did all the arranging from this end by email with a Nepali sirdar we had met on a previous trip. We too were concerned about the exploitation - especially of porters who often are poorly equipped for higher altitudes and often totally uninsured by the company. These are concerns that you must sort out before going. Our group of 11 people from the UK flew out with Qatar Airways. All our porters were well equipped and very happy! A trip like this (we climbed a peak in the 22-day trek and then went to North India for a week) doesn't need to cost an arm and a leg - our total was about \u00a31,500 and we didn't rough it. Contact Saroj Neupane of Beyond the Limits Trekking in Kathmandu. Email blimits@ntc.net.np. Chris Walker \u0095 Two years ago, after I retired, my husband and I went on a three-month round-the-world trip, which we organised with the help of Trailfinders. Our final destination was Kathmandu. We weren't fit enough for proper Himalayan two-three week treks but we wanted to walk in the hills around Kathmandu Valley. We had acquired our own driver by chance at the airport, and if he couldn't arrange something for us, he knew someone who could. He took us to Galaxy Trekking and Expedition Ltd on Durbar Marg (it's upstairs so not easily spotted). The staff were very helpful and one spoke excellent English. We booked a two-day 'mini' trek to Nagarkot and back, with a night in a small hotel overlooking the Himalayas, three meals, transport to and from the start and finish point, and a Sherpa guide, Sanu Gurung, just for us. Sanu was patient, courteous without being deferential, informative, with good English and a sense of humour. Our outward trek was only for about 4 hours, with a \"lunch break\" in the middle. We'd only put water and biscuits in our small rucksack with basic overnight things, to keep the weight down, though Sanu insisted on carrying it! We have corresponded with Sanu since, and last year he decided to set up his own company - Naturel and Trekking and Expedition(P) Ltd which also arranges safaris, whitewater rafting etc. The address is PO Box 20560, Thamel, Bhagawati Bahal, Kathmandu, tel 423283 and 4116804, fax: 00977-1-423283, email natureland@htp.com.np. Janet Blackburn \u0095 My husband is Nepali, and although now living in England he has worked as a trekking guide in the Annapurna region of Nepal for 10 years. Naturally, he is acutely aware of the issues facing both porters and guides and spent quite some time supporting the rights of porters. We would recommend that the only way to really guarantee the fair treatment of your guides and porters is to communicate directly with them and find out about their pay and conditions and support them further if necessary. We would be very happy to offer you any further information or first hand advice about trekking or travelling in Nepal in general. We can also recommend highly experienced and reliable independent guides to you if you decide to arrange a trek from this country without using an agency. Sam and Guru Sharma mountaingurus@yahoo.com. \u0095 I strongly recommend Yogesh Tamang who arranges tailor-made treks. See www.karmartreks.com or contact yogi_trek@hotmail.com. I am travelling with Yogesh for the fifth time in September for three weeks in the Langtang area. \u0095 I have been trekking three times in Nepal, and recommend Wilderness Experience Pvt. Ltd, GPO. Box 4065, Gyaneshor, Kathmandu, Nepal; tel: 977-1-417832, fax 977-1-417243; email wildex@ecomail.com.np, www.cadvision.com/wilderness. They are experienced, reliable and efficient. John Vernon \u0095 I can thoroughly recommend Nilgiri Treks and Mountaineering if you want to organise a supported trek in Nepal. I have used them twice and am hoping to organise another trek with them in Autumn 2001. Several friends have also used them both for trekking and for climbing. Da Gombu Sherpa is the owner (he is a UIAGM Guide with high altitude experience) and he can be contacted by email at Chereme@gombu.wlink.com.np. \u0095 I would like to recommend Pasang Lama as a good reliable guide for trekking in Nepal. Pasang takes great care of the local environment, and makes sure that he spreads trekker's income around, by ensuring that money for food and accommodation goes directly to people in local villages. He also pays his sherpas and porters at well above the minimum rate, ensures they are properly clothed, and that the porters carry less than the recommended amount. Porters and sherpas will also eat the same food as their trekking clients. He can be contacted in Nepal on plama@plama.wlink.com.np or in the UK on mcarrott@lineone.net. \u0095 We did a DIY trekking and touring trip to Nepal late last year. Our trek was organised by Lhakpa Sherpa and his UK contact Pat Steel. The organisation was faultless. As well as saving a lot on commercial prices we felt that we were making a worthwhile contribution to Lhakpa's village community. Pat Steel can be contacted on 015395 64122. Caroline Eustace Sublime Treks and Excursions Limited is a Kathmandu-based trekking company started by a group of local people from the Helambu region of Nepal.

Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence and foreign affairs spokesman, warned him not to be drawn into making political statements. His comments came after allies of the prince, a former Royal Navy officer who holds a number of honorary military posts, leaked his concerns to the Daily Mail, to the annoyance of Labour ministers and their Liberal Democrat allies. The Mail reported that the prince had privately told friends of his \"anxieties\" that the new European force could undermine the special relationship between Britain and the US. \"If these reports are true, as Prince Philip might well have said, 'it's none of his bloody business',\" Mr Campbell said. \"Prince Charles should not stray into the political arena on this or any other issue.\" Mr Campbell rejected any suggestion that the new force, which was agreed at the EU summit in Nice this month, could undermine the central role of Nato as the guarantor of Europe's defence. \"An effective European defence policy will preserve the security of the UK and reinforce the effectiveness of Nato,\" he said.

The party's majority was slashed from 13,000 to 705 in the seat made vacant by the rebel ex-Labour MP Dennis Canavan, after an unexpectedly strong challenge from the Scottish National party. The SNP said the result was a stunning achievement for the party and if the 16% swing in its favour was repeated at a general election it would claim the seats of members of the cabinet such as Robin Cook and Alistair Darling. The turnout was one of the lowest in Scotland, at 36.2%. The parties had struggled to get the voters out in the face of bad weather, and the electoral register for the area was due to be replaced. It was estimated that around 10,000 voters were disenfran chised from the 50,000-strong list. The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said the turnout had affected the Labour vote but he was confident the party would increase its majority in a general election. He said when the byelection had first been announced, analysts predicted Labour would lose to the SNP and he congratulated the Labour candidate, a former army major, Eric Joyce, for holding off the nationalists. \"Coming from where we did a few weeks ago we can genuinely say we are very pleased this morning to have retained this seat with not a huge majority but a working majority,\" Mr Reid said. But the SNP leader, John Swinney , said the result for his party's candidate, David Kerr, showed that the nationalists were snapping at Labour's heels. \"The SNP vote rose and the Labour vote came down,\" he said. \"That is the pattern of Scottish politics - the SNP is doing well and moving forward and gaining votes, and the Labour party is slipping.\" Mr Swinney also announced that he would be asking for Labour's election expenses to be scrutinised in light of the campaign the party ran. He said supporters had been brought in from as far away as Doncaster, and the constituency had been flooded with glossy Labour brochures. The Scottish Conservative party, meanwhile, saw its share of the vote fall by 4% to 1,621 votes, and the Liberal Democrats came fifth behind the Scottish Socialist party with 615 votes. Mr Canavan held the Falkirk West seat as MP for 25 years. He was expelled from Labour after standing and winning as an independent in the constituency at the Scottish parliament elections last year. Labour had excluded him from its candidate list after branding him \"not good enough\". Mr Canavan, who will remain as the constituency's member of the Scottish parliament, was asked to rejoin Labour after the death of Donald Dewar, but, after initially withdrawing his resignation, he announced he would be standing down.

For only the third time in a decade, its first heavy storm swept in from Italy, which, according to the locals, usually portends good conditions through the season. Usually, Zermatt's weather arrives from north-west Europe. </p> <p>As the place prepared for the seasonal rush, it was still possible, just, to ski back to the resort, though to do so demanded ability to manage slush and avoid bare patches. Superb early falls, which had created a base of 40cm on the lower slopes, had been gnawed at by a warm, nagging wind. But it was not just the brooding weather, the light rain and disturbingly high temperature of 9C at resort level, which was on our minds as we boarded the underground funicular on what was, for us, the first day of a new season. </p> <p>Inevitably, our thoughts turned to last month's tragedy in the Austrian resort of Kaprun, where 155 skiers had died when fire swept through a similar train. My companion confessed it sent a shiver down his spine. It was a sentiment which will be echoed many times this season, here and on other such mountain railways. </p> <p>Zermatt's tourist office director Roland Imboden says the resort has already reacted to concerns raised by the disaster. \"The Sunegga Express already has partitions between its compartments, to prevent fire spreading rapidly,\" he stressed, \"but we have put in extra fire extinguishers.\" </p> <p>From mid-mountain up, conditions were good enough to dispel such gloomy preoccupations. Above around 2,500m, it had remained cool enough to keep the snow in good condition, and for most of the way from the Rothorn to Blauherd there was deliciously-groomed powder. </p> <p>The second day showed just what a huge early snowfall Zermatt had received. There were a couple of metres banked up by the cog railway to Gornergrat. The temperature dipped, the sun burned off a thin layer of cloud, the mountains were revealed in all their glory. Monte Rosa, Liskamm, Castor and Pollux and the Breithorn, all above 4,000m were ranged in a great rampart, blue green ice of glaciers breaking through a superficially benign whiteness. And on the wide outside, standing aloof, the Matterhorn, Zermatt's trademark, still looking barely climbable to the timid eye. </p> <p>At the top, the snow squeaked invitingly under our boots. The red runs to Riffelalp and Gant were in prime condition: swooping, euphoric descents with so few skiers on the piste that there was never any need to adjust a turn to avoid collision. Though it was a mistake to round off the day on the National downhill run, for hard pack was by now turning to ice in the late afternoon shadow, this was some of the best December skiing I have experienced. </p> <p>On the slopes by the Klein Matterhorn, it was even better - long, flattering stretches of dry powder reaching down to Plan Maison, above Cervinia, over the invisible frontier in Italy. We lunched off capaletti and tagaliatelle ai funghi porcini and skied down, no passports needed, enjoying the sunshine from the south and the enthusiasm of Italians up for Sunday from the Aosta Valley. </p> <p>Zermatt is a perplexing resort. It is like an ageing aristocrat who has fallen on difficult times and needs to take in the odd downmarket lodger to make ends meet. Upper-crust families who have skied here for generations have to pass a McDonald's as they go jingling up to the Mont Cervin in the hotel's horse-drawn post-coach. Elsie's, where you may top off a day's skiing with champagne and oysters, now has to compete with brasher bars, such as The Pipe, a snowboarders' hang out, which advertises \"groovy music, chillin' sport videos and wild party nights\". </p> <p>The resort moves reluctantly, you feel, with the times, though it has installed an extensive snowmaking system and last season it introduced new ski passes, incorporating microchips that open lift gates - most of the time - without the need to fish for them in your pocket. </p> <p>However, the lift system itself could still be much more skier friendly. A cable car from Gant to Hoht\u00e4lli allows skiers using the Sunegga Express to avoid the laboriously slow Gornergrat cog railway, which opened originally in 1898 and takes a good half hour from village to top station. But several good runs descend to intermittent stops on the line and skiers seduced by them can waste a lot of time waiting for trains back up. And the connection between Gornergrat and Furi, where cable cars run to Furgg and Schwarzsee en route to the glacier skiing beneath the Klein Matterhorn, could surely be made easier. </p> <p>Until this winter, there was only one ski school, which had come under heavy criticism in recent years. Now the monopoly has been cracked with the launch of a rival operation, but Zermatt has been slower than other major resorts to embrace the new competitive spirit. </p> <p>The village remains traffic free save for its ubiquitous electric taxis, whose drivers sometimes charge exorbitant fares. Those arriving by car must park at neighbouring T\u00e4sch. Most catch the train from there. </p> <p>Though the resort now provides excellent free buses, which are also battery powered and run at 15-minute intervals, it is unlikely you will be able to avoid walking uncomfortable distances in ski boots. Depending on where you stay and which slopes you decide to ski on, it could easily take an hour from the last breakfast coffee to the first turns of the day, which those who are accustomed the relative convenience of purpose-built resorts may find frustrating. </p> <p>But Zermatt's character overrides such drawbacks. This is a resort of strong flavours rather than blandness. There are hotels full of stories, such as the Monte Rosa, where Churchill stayed and Whymper made his base before conquering the Matterhorn. In the old part of the village, there are still wooden Alpine barns, raised on stilts to keep the rats at bay. </p> <p>On the slopes, the choice of eateries is much greater than on most other mountains and you may wipe out the afternoon with a long lunch or refuel quickly on r\u00f6sti and a drink for around \u00a310. And while the abiding impression of its skiing is of terrain that demands a reasonable degree of respect without instilling fear, there is a sense of variety and exploration which is lacking in some, more meticulously planned ski areas. </p> <p>Many seasons of disappointed expectations instill wariness about predicting conditions.

He said when the byelection had first been announced, analysts predicted Labour would lose to the SNP and he congratulated the Labour candidate, a former army major, Eric Joyce, for holding off the nationalists. \"Coming from where we did a few weeks ago we can genuinely say we are very pleased this morning to have retained this seat with not a huge majority but a working majority,\" Mr Reid said. But the SNP leader, John Swinney, said the result for his party's candidate, David Kerr, showed that the nationalists were snapping at Labour's heels. \"The SNP vote rose and the Labour vote came down,\" he said. \"That is the pattern of Scottish politics - the SNP is doing well and moving forward and gaining votes, and the Labour party is slipping.\" Mr Swinney also announced that he would be asking for Labour's election expenses to be scrutinised in light of the campaign the party ran. He said supporters had been brought in from as far away as Doncaster, and the constituency had been flooded with glossy Labour brochures. The Scottish Conservative party, meanwhile, saw its share of the vote fall by 4% to 1,621 votes, and the Liberal Democrats came fifth behind the Scottish Socialist party with 615 votes. Mr Canavan held the Falkirk West seat as MP for 25 years. He was expelled from Labour after standing and winning as an independent in the constituency at the Scottish parliament elections last year. Labour had excluded him from its candidate list after branding him \"not good enough\". Mr Canavan, who will remain as the constituency's member of the Scottish parliament, was asked to rejoin Labour after the death of Donald Dewar, but, after initially withdrawing his resignation, he announced he would be standing down.

By using Buzz, easyJet, Ryanair and Go, it claims to have brought short breaks within reach of a wider market. It says it will also fly customers on British Airways when fares are low enough. Prices in its new Ski Xpress programme start at \u00a3185 for three nights at <strong> Brides les Bains</strong> in France, which is linked by gondola lift to the better known M\u00e9ribel. The deal includes a hire car but is based on four sharing a studio. Two sharing can expect to pay significantly more than that, particularly at high season.

Flights are available to Lyon or Geneva from a range of airports, including Gatwick, Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. </p> <p>* Meanwhile, though the new season has barely got under way, First Choice has published its first brochure for next winter - with \"small price increases due to the extra cost of aviation fuel\".

The firm promises to update those who register on its site with availability and snow reports. Prices are generally higher than those from First Choice but include scheduled flights from London City Airport. In January or early February, they start at \u00a3486 for three nights' half-board beneath the Eiger in the Swiss resort of <strong> Grindelwald</strong> . A similar break in March costs from \u00a3534 in <strong> Flims</strong> , also in Switzerland. Four nights at Easter cost from \u00a3615. </p> <p>* Colorado's <strong> Vail</strong> has another 125 acres of skiing after opening the final lift in its new Blue Sky Basin expansion. One aim of the project, which was bitterly opposed by environmentalists, was to create new powder-skiing options for intermediates. Nearly half the terrain in the Basin, which has 18 marked runs and three high-speed four-seat lifts, is suitable for intermediates seeking to improve their technique in deep snow. The latest lift allows skiing between thinned-out pines in Pete's Bowl - named after Vail's founder Peter Seibert - and has gradients that are less steep than those in most of the resort's other Back Bowls. </p> <p>* Those staying this side of the Atlantic can learn how to cope with deep snow on the slopes of <strong> Val d'Is\u00e8re</strong> and <strong> Tignes</strong> . Ski Solutions (020- 7471 7777) is offering two courses in off-piste skiing. One is aimed at \"confident piste skiers\" trying it for the first time or anyone whose technique falls seriously short. The other is for those who are fairly adept already but want to improve. Progress is analysed on video each evening. Both courses cost \u00a3365 for six days, including a lift pass and the use of avalanche transceivers. Maximum group size is eight and six respectively. They run from January 14, February 4 and March 18. Prices do not include transport or accommodation, but Ski Solutions can link the courses with chalet packages.

      "bodyText": "There were further rumours of consolidation in the radio industry yesterday. Market gossips reckon Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper, has increased its stake in Jazz FM to around 19% after buying a further million shares. GMG's stakebuilding exercise would seem to reflect the wider radio industry trend, as the leading players position themselves ahead of the likely reform of rules governing radio ownership. The recent communications white paper suggested that an overhaul of regulations is on the cards. At the moment no single company may own more than 15% of the national commercial radio audience. Jazz FM's other main shareholder is Clear Channel Communications, the US media group which joined forces with GMG in an abortive bid for Virgin Radio earlier this year. Jazz FM shares closed 7p higher at 192.5p.",

Here are some likely survivors. Best country site Egypt's Official Internet Site www.touregypt.net More than 1,000 pages of compelling Egyptian history, virtual safaris, a guide to scuba diving in the Red Sea, dozens of children's activities - including colouring sheets and games - and bulletin boards. The latest feature allows you to e-mail your holiday requirements to a number of tour operators, who will contact you with suitable deals. Runner-up: Greenland www.greenland-guide.gl Best oddity www.desertusa.com You 're driving along an Arizona highway at midnight. How do you distinguish between a rattlesnake and another reptile? And why should you avoid going out at full moon? The night-driving guide is only a tiny section of this magnificent celebration of the ghost towns, natural history and culture of the US desert. Runner-up: Traveldonkey www.traveldonkey.com Best free advice and information WalkScotland www.walkscotland.com Contacts, suggested walks and practical information for hikers and climbers in Scotland. Runner-up: Ifyouski.com www.ifyouski.com Best online guide www.fodors.com Build a miniguide to your holiday destination, choosing the hotels, restaurants and nightlife in your price range, and print it off before you go. For city trips, consult www.timeout.com for a less middle-aged perspective. Runner-up: Rough Guides travel.roughguides.com Best for inspiration www.whatsonwhen.com Tells you more than a guidebook can. Quite how whatsonwhen.com manages to keep track of events all over the world is hard to imagine, but they do it exceptionally well. The startling Fractal Map - so new and unfamiliar that it comes with instructions - provides an alternative way of navigating the site. Runner-up: Travel intelligence.net www.travelintelligence.net Best specialist site www.journeywoman.com Occasionally over-enthusiastic but with an engaging American vigour, this is dedicated to the needs of women travelling - whether alone, in a group or on business. You might wince at a title like \"She's So Very Subway Savvy\", but the advice therein is invaluable. Runner-up: Mumsnet www.mumsnet.com Best budget airline www.buzzaway.com Bright, clearly designed and with regular Deals of the Week, Buzz just beats Go and easyJet to the top, although all are easy to use. Ryanair tends to be cheaper, but the horrendous typos and failure to include taxes in initial quotes are disappointing. Runner-up: easyJet www.easyjet.co.uk Best online shopping Columbus Direct www.columbusdirect.co.uk Buying travel insurance here takes about four minutes. Columbus then sends you an e-mail containing two PDF files to print off detailing the policy. Runner-up: Expedia www.expedia.co.uk",

Deciding that what isn't broke does not need fixing, Shyamalan is back with a second depressing film set in Philadelphia in which Willis has a marriage on the fritz, a complicated relationship with a miserable young boy, and strange, paranormal powers. As is usually the case with sequels, the original was a whole lot better.</p> <p>The Sixth Sense II, heretofore identified as Unbreakable, stars Willis as a downwardly mobile security guard who is the only survivor of a massive train wreck. Not only does he escape with his life; he walks away without a scratch. Oddly, he does not seem elated by his miraculous escape, nor, for that matter, surprised. Shortly thereafter, he is contacted by a mysterious comic-book buff played with trademark intensity by Samuel L Jackson. </p> <p>Jackson suffers from a rare disease that makes his bones as brittle as glass. Consequently, he spends a good portion of the film in a wheelchair and the entire film in a bad mood. (He also wears a Drifters era wig so preposterous it makes it hard to take anything he says seriously. Lamentably, the director never explains whether his macabre hairdo is a cultivated look or a side-effect of his medication.) Jackson has come to believe that Willis is his polar opposite, a superhuman figure whose bones are not subject to the usual rules of osteopathy. Ostensibly, he wants his counterpart to don the mantle of greatness and begin his new life as a living, breathing superhero. Presumably, with a bit of help from a more cerebrally gifted sidekick.</p> <p>Willis does not think this is such a good idea. He has a bad marriage, a crummy job, and a tormented relationship with his son. The last thing he needs is a second career as the Delaware Valley Man of Steel. But little by little, he begins to suspect that Jackson may be on to something. Looking back on his past, he realises that he has never been sick, never missed a day of work. The only injury he ever suffered was in a high school car crash. But even in that instance, he walked away in one piece. Curiouser and curiouser.</p> <p>In The Sixth Sense, a young boy is tormented by an unusual and thoroughly undesirable power: the ability to see dead people. (It is my belief that the boy is confused, that most of the seemingly \"dead\" people in the movie are actual real-life Philadelphians. But that may be because I grew up there.) In Unbreakable, Willis possesses a similar extrasensory gift: he can \"see\" the crimes that strangers have committed. Until he meets Jackson, he is reluctant to do anything with this power. But now, under the dual pressure applied by the weird comic-book aficionado and his own son, who would dearly love to be able to introduce his father as a superhero, he reluctantly decides to accept his destiny. Needless to say, bloodshed quickly ensues.</p> <p>As in The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable takes place in a dank, lugubrious, surreal world in which the spectator is tricked into thinking that he can discern an underlying logic. As in The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable has unexpected plot twists, weird coincidences and red herrings to confuse and disorient the public. And, as in The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable has a trick ending that the audience should see coming from miles away, but doesn't.</p> <p>Despite these similarities Unbreakable is not nearly as entertaining a movie as its predecessor. It takes forever for the sepulchral film to get going. Jackson talks too much. Willis talks too little. The arty camera work merely reinforces the film's maddening vagueness, and the derivative soundtrack constantly evokes memories of Peter Weir's Fearless, a much better, far less manipulative film about a man who survives a plane crash. And while Unbreakable has the same languid, creepy feel as The Sixth Sense, it suffers from a much more convoluted and contrived story line.</p> <p>The film also suffers from one disastrous casting decision, the same casting decision that afflicts many Hollywood products. Shyamalan picked the wrong kid to play Willis's son. Willis, who grew up not far from Philadelphia, is quite persuasive as a rent-a-cop, because he looks like a rent-a-cop. Robin Wright Penn is similarly convincing as his emotionally drained wife, and Jackson does his usual fine work as a first-class lunatic.</p> <p>But wide-eyed, freckled Spencer Treat Clark is no more convincing as a West Philly prole than he was as a trainee Roman emperor in Gladiator. He looks like the sort of fiercely wholesome child actor who was born to play the role of Spencer Treat Clark and nothing else. His wan performance is a jarring note in a film that depends on a mood of seamless creepiness to work. It's as if Elton John suddenly turned up in a Marilyn Manson video.</p> <p>Here I would like to inject a personal note. As noted, Unbreakable takes place in Philadelphia, where I grew up. In it, Willis plays a security guard who works at what is clearly the University of Pennsylvania and has a son named Joseph. My father worked as a security guard at the University of Pennsylvania, and I am named Joseph. Given these eerie coincidences, it seems ill-advised, and perhaps even dangerous (needlessly inviting karmic, paranormal retribution) not to give the film an exuberant thumbs-up.</p> <p>This, however, I cannot do. Like Bruce Willis, I was born with an inexplicable psychic power whose origins and purpose mystify me. The power to which I refer is this: </p> <p>I can see dead horses.

Did that present any special difficulties?</strong></p> <p>It's harder, because it's very intimidating for them and, on the other hand, we get a little nervous as well. With armed combat, it's not so bad because I know when to retract. But with full contact, I much prefer working with a stunt guy because we can just hit the hell out of each other. We know we will be accurate because we have trained and worked with each other before, and are used to fights that are very close. But when you have someone new, you are so afraid that they will panic. </p> <p><strong>Yet you were the one who really got hurt on this. That must've been kind of embarrassing.</strong> </p> <p>Yeah, but when we go for it, we really go all out. When you are on-wires/off-wires, your body and mind gets a little out of sync. One minute you take a little leap and you're 30ft in the air, the next minute you leap and you're one foot off the ground and you're thinking, what happened here? But I wasn't even doing a big stunt when it happened, just an ordinary jumping kick. But you know, it's just different elements: the ground could have been uneven, a stone in the way or something like that, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground. There was no option but to go to America for knee surgery and intense physiotherapy, and they had to reschedule the whole shoot because the rest of my action scenes couldn't be done until the last 10 days. </p> <p><strong>Well, it could have been worse.

So this was a big hurdle for me, but I was determined because I wanted to work with Ang. I had someone read me the script and I wrote it down phonetically, so that when I was on my own I could sit there and go, \"Ne-ne-ne-ne.\" It was like a singing lesson, I had no idea what I was saying and it sounded awful. </p> <p><strong>All the more amazing, then, that you got so much poignancy and feeling across.</strong> </p> <p>I really did believe that Ang would help me expand on my acting. Too often with action movies, it gets so overwhelming that my acting sort of gets waylaid. And that's a real shame, because without drama, there is no real action.

Doubles and twins around \u00a3105, B&amp;B for two sharing.",

      "body": "<p>It's easy to imagine Cape Town the way it was when the Portuguese seafarers first set eyes on it some 500 years ago. The view from an approaching Boeing is much the same as it must have been for a ship sailing nervously into the Cape of Storms. There it is: Table Mountain rising more than 3,500ft to its trademark flat top and billowing white table cloth, overshadowing Lion's Head and Devil's Peak and the moody Atlantic Ocean. </p> <p>Cape Town's appeal has a lot to do with its geography. It is one of the few places in the world where you can go from city centre to open mountainside in a couple of miles. The city also has a complex political and historical character offering an abundance of unusual and exciting experiences. </p> <p>Here are some of the best: </p> <p><strong> 1 Take a hike </strong><br> </p> <p> A map of The Mountain, as locals refer to it, as if it were the only one in the world, hints at its charms with names such as Saddle Rock, Woodcutters Path, Silverstream Ravine and Window gorge. </p> <p>Hiking on Table Mountain takes you into the glory of the abundant fynbos - 2,285 native plant species in the Cape peninsula, an area smaller than London. Cool gorges and big flat rocks (the name Breakfast Rock appears frequently on the map) make for excellent resting spots to enjoy the views. </p> <p>Take hiking boots and a sweater. Don't go without a guide or guidebook and pay attention to the safety and hiking recommendations - lives are lost on this mountain every year. </p> <p> Recommended guidebook: Mike Lundy's Best Walks in the Cape Peninsula. Best guide: Peter Schoonraad, tel: 438 7206, R200 (\u00a318.30) per day per person. </p> <p><strong> 2 The pan-African market </strong><br> </p> <p> Snatches of Swahili, French and English waft through this market, incongruously housed in a multi-storied Victorian building in the city centre. It is a microcosm of Africa, representing more than a dozen countries, including Cameroon, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast and Kenya. </p> <p>Here, you can buy masks, fabrics, musical instruments, hand-made wooden furniture, township art, batik and ceramics from all over the continent. </p> <p>An Ethiopian chef runs the restaurant, serving traditional dishes like injira and the popular West African mafe, a peanut-butter stew, as well as curries and pap, the traditional maize meal that is a staple of Africa. </p> <p> 76 Long Street, Mon-Fri 9am-5pm, Sat 9am-3pm, tel: 424 2957. </p> <p><strong> 3 Delaire wine farm</strong><br> </p> <p> Buying wine in the Cape combines exquisite scenery, ex-cellar prices, gourmet food and a memento that should outlast your tan. These elements are elegantly combined at Delaire wine farm, set on a mountain pass outside Stellenbosch. </p> <p>But it's not just a pretty view. The altitude of the vineyards is an important contributing factor to the number of awards won by the Delaire label. Recommended buys: Delaire unwooded Sauvignon Blanc 2000, R35 (\u00a33.20) a bottle and Delaire Cabernet-Merlot 1999, R75 (\u00a36.90) a bottle. Add R485 (\u00a344.50) for shipping 12 bottles door to door, including all duties and taxes. </p> <p>Follow the wine tasting in the cellar with lunch at the adjacent Green Door, where dishes like spring chicken with roasted mustard seed and honey are served on the cool and shady terrace. </p> <p> Delaire, Helshoogte (on R310), Banhoek, Stellenbosch (tel: 88 51756, e-mail: delaire@iafrica.com). </p> <p><strong> 4 Go for gold </strong><br> </p> <p> Musuku is the Venda word for gold, and the star of the Musuku exhibition at the South African National Gallery is a solid-gold rhino. You will see a selection of the most exquisite objects recovered from royal burial sites of the ancient African kingdoms, many on public display for the first time. </p> <p> Government Avenue, Gardens, 10am-5pm Tuesday-Friday, until January 7, tel: 465 1628. </p> <p><strong> 5 Township tour</strong><br> </p> <p> In her modest living room in the township of Langa, Madosini Manquina presses the calabash of the uhadi to her bare shoulder and the delicately varying sounds of this traditional music instrument will take you to a different world. Then, the deep sounds of six kudu horns vibrate around the small room like African saxophones. After the impromptu concert, we head for Langa's Waterfront (so named for the six dusty palm trees that line the road) where Sheila Mahloane, proprietor of the Lapa restaurant, has prepared a African dinner. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Tiger's Tavern is thumping to drums and marimbas, and by the time we arrive, the party is well underway. It only takes one energetic rendition of Amajoba! for us to dump our inhibitions and take to the floor. </p> <p>When Thope Lekau arrives to take us to Kopanong B&amp;B in Khayelitsha, we are ready for bed. Mama Thope has extended her matchbox township house into a cosy and spotless haven for guests and only just stops short of tucking us into bed. </p> <p> Township music tour includes transfers, tour, dinner, musical experience, bed and breakfast, from R524 (\u00a348) to (R864) \u00a379.30 per person, tel: 426 4260, e-mail: info@cape-town.org. Kopanong B&amp;B, Thope Lekau, tel: 361 2084 or 082 476 1278. </p> <p><strong> 6 Kloofing </strong><br> </p> <p> Can you hike 12 miles? Can you swim 160ft? Jump 16ft? Are you mad? Kloofing involves hopping, skipping and jumping down a river descending through mountains. That's the official definition. What it also means is that, after a day of kloofing, nothing, and they stress nothing, will be dry. You often face a pool of dark icy water with no way round and no option but to jump into the abyss. In the Cape's most famous kloofing spot, Suicide Gorge, you will have to swim through many such pools, some of them 160ft long. And first you also have to get to the river, which means a lengthy hike through scenery that will take your breath away, even if you can jump 15ft off a rock without blinking. </p> <p> Daytrippers Adventure Tours, R325 (\u00a329.80) for a kloofing day trip, tel: 531 3274, e-mail: trippers@iafrica.com </p> <p><strong> 7 Hit the road</strong><br> </p> <p> Take advantage of the cheaper car-rental rates in South Africa to go a little upmarket and hire an MGB Roadster. Cruising the highways and byways of the Cape in an open car lets in the view of blue mountain ridges and the fragrance of a lane of rose trees. Roads are of a good standard, and the Roadster is well suited to the hairpin bends of Du Toitskloof or Bain's Kloof passes, and ideal for touring through the winelands. </p> <p> Classic Twin Tours, R540 (\u00a349.50) per day and R2 (18p) per km plus petrol, R5,000 (\u00a3458.70) refundable insurance excess, tel: 88 22558, e-mail: enquiries@classictwin tours.com. </p> <p><strong> 8 Beach banquets </strong><br> </p> <p> Swooping seagulls, crashing waves and white sand set the scene for a number of casual beach eateries on the West Coast within an hour's drive of Cape Town. </p> <p>Bread is baked in a traditional oven on the beach, and two or three kinds of fish are grilled over the coals. Patrons sit on rough wooden benches and tuck into their own supply of drinks. The highlight of the beach banquet is crayfish. </p> <p> From R95-R140 (\u00a38.70-\u00a312.80). Die Strandloper, Langebaan beach, tel: (022) 77 22490. Strandkombuis, Sixteen Mile Beach, Yzerfontein, tel: (022) 451 2206. </p> <p><strong> 9 Sunsets and nightlife</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the recurring highlights of a Cape Town holiday is to wash off the sand after a day on the beach, change into a cool white garment that shows off your tan and savour the sunset with a drink in hand. </p> <p>Camps Bay is the prime spot for spectacular sunsets and cocktails. Baraza (The Promenade, tel: 438 2016) is a bar with a Spice Island theme. Next door is the Cape Town legend Blues (The Promenade, tel: 438 2050). Blues is ideal if sundowners are going to lead to dinner and the Californian/Mediterranean menu is ideal for hot summer nights. Book well in advance if you want a coveted balcony table. </p> <p>La Med (Glen Country Club, Clifton, tel: 438 5600) is set close to the sea and draws a younger crowd that rocks with a DJ every night. </p> <p><strong> 10 Jazz it up </strong><br> </p> <p> Cape Town's jazz culture is famous for producing the likes of Dollar Brand, and this legacy lives on in dozens of caf\u00e9s, township taverns and bars. Canal Walk (Century City, tel: 550 8731) hosts a Summer Jazz Festival starring popular local artists like Sylvia Mdumyelwa and Gavin Minter. The Jazz Castle (Ottery Value Centre, tel: 704 2351) features commercial jazz, and the upmarket Green Dolphin (V&amp;A Waterfront, tel: 421 7471) showcases local bands such as the Sylvester Mazinyane Trio and Cliffie Moses' 4 Sounds. On Sundays, the Winchester Mansions (221 Beach Rd, Sea Point, tel: 434 2351) offers a Jazz Brunch that includes sparkling wine and the Sunday paper for R85 (\u00a37.80). <br></p> <p> <strong> Top Attractions </strong><br></p> <p>According to Cape Town Tourism, the main crowdpullers are: </p> <p><strong> 1 V&amp;A Waterfront </strong> - run-down docklands turned tourist magnet in a Victorian working harbour against the backdrop of Table Mountain. </p> <p><strong> 2 Cape Town beaches</strong> - most popular are Clifton and Camps Bay. </p> <p><strong> 3 Table Mountain cable car</strong> - an intense five minutes rotating slowly upwards past vertical rock face and views of greater Cape Town. </p> <p><strong> 4 Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens</strong> - more than 5,000 plant species in gardens sprawling over the lower slopes of Table Mountain. </p> <p><strong> 5 Cape Point and the Good Hope Nature Reserve</strong> - zebra, buck, baboons and birds are a bonus to the sight of the African continent dropping vertically into the wild waters where the Atlantic and the Indian oceans meet. </p> <p><strong> 6 Winelands</strong> - wine farms distinguished by Cape Dutch architecture, towering mountain ranges and innovative wine making. </p> <p><strong> 7 Robben Island</strong> - where South African ex-president Nelson Mandela was jailed and former political prisoners act as guides. </p> <p><strong> 8 Cape Town museums</strong> - including the SA Cultural History Museum, the South African Museum, the 17th-century Good Hope Castle and the newly-refurbished District Six Museum housing a memory room with an impressive sound archive. </p> <p><strong> 9 Two Oceans Aquarium </strong> - more than 300 species of marine life, as well as a special exhibit of eels and water snakes from all over the world. </p> <p><strong> 10 Imax Cinema</strong> - particular emphasis on African nature documentaries.<br></p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> BA (0845 7733377) flies Heathrow-Cape Town from Jan-March for \u00a3597 plus taxes.

      "body": "<p>This year, I reckon that I have eaten in more than 280 restaurants. There are probably other people out there who have scoffed in even more, but it still seems a lot to me. If you average that out at three dishes per restaurant, that comes to 840 separate dishes, washed down by roughly 140 bottles of wine, which strikes me as being rather modest, all in all. </p> <p>Out of this colossal aggregation of experience comes a colossal aggregation of metric measurements: waist, weight and jowls. However, I like giving awards, basically because it gives me the opportunity to relish one more time some of the pleasures and disappointments of the past 12 months.</p> <p><strong> Hate of the Year </strong></p> <p> The list of things that get my goat just keeps getting longer and longer, as the old irritants - lollo rosso, mint sprigs on everything, grilled goat's cheese as the sole vegetarian option, Exxon Valdez-sized slicks of truffle oil, and the ubiquity of balsamic vinegar, that tomato ketchup of the contemporary kitchen and condiment of choice for chefs without a scintilla of imagination - march on in spite of my annual denunciations. </p> <p>At the same time, new absur-dities keep popping up with disconcerting frequency. This year, it was giganticism of menu covers. By vast, I don't mean in length, but in the sheer size of the damned things. Choosing what to eat is now like hiding behind a hoarding. What's more, hardly any restaurant is exempt from this appalling affliction; even favoured places such as the Fat Duck, and Orient could usefully downsize, but most absurdly oversized of all was the menu for Cassia Oriental, which was in inverse proportion to my pleasure at eating there. A model of how a menu can be laid out clearly and remain on a human scale was that at New End.</p> <p><strong> Ingredient of the Year </strong></p> <p>It should be cod, which, rumour has it, will be disappearing from our menus shortly. Fat chance - cod is the most fashionable fish among chefs at the moment; quite the little sea bass de nos jours, in fact (sea bass having lost its cachet since most of it is now farmed). </p> <p> Chefs in general seem to be giving in to their baser instincts. There has been a tremendous run on cheeks - veal (Ibla), ox (Lettonie), pig (New End) - all of which require what is probably the Cooking Technique of the Year: braising, the long slow cooking method that not so long ago we were told that restaurants couldn't cope with. </p> <p>But neither cod nor bare-faced cheek is my ingredient of the year. For sheer ubiquity, nothing beats the poached egg, be it duck's (Pug), chicken's (Cotto and many others) or quail's (Maison Novelli, Ibla), on salad, tuna tartare or asparagus, soothing, sexy and cheap. Get that poached egg on the dinner party menu right away.</p> <p><strong> Dish of the Year </strong></p> <p> A difficult one, this. I remember with slavering affection the plate of antipasti that I had at Ristorante Abruzzi in Rome and the monumental bollito misto at the Tre Galline in Turin. Then there was the gentle richness of a veal cutlet with goat's cheese, anchovy and almond fondue from Tom Ilic at New End, and Heston Blumenthal's crab risotto with crab ice cream, red pepper cassonade and passion fruit jelly at the Fat Duck. </p> <p> For a while, I was tempted to give it to the roast freshwater eel with tomatoes, Sechuan pepper sauce, leeks and asparagus that I had at the Admiralty in Somerset House. It was an outstanding number, satisfying on every count, and a wonderful use of a sadly neglected fish.</p> <p> In the end, however, the dish that I would most like to eat again and again was the baked ginger parkin with hot spiced treacle and rhubarb ripple ice cream, which I polished off at the Star Inn in Harome, North Yorkshire.

      "bodyText": "This year, I reckon that I have eaten in more than 280 restaurants. There are probably other people out there who have scoffed in even more, but it still seems a lot to me. If you average that out at three dishes per restaurant, that comes to 840 separate dishes, washed down by roughly 140 bottles of wine, which strikes me as being rather modest, all in all. Out of this colossal aggregation of experience comes a colossal aggregation of metric measurements: waist, weight and jowls. However, I like giving awards, basically because it gives me the opportunity to relish one more time some of the pleasures and disappointments of the past 12 months. Hate of the Year The list of things that get my goat just keeps getting longer and longer, as the old irritants - lollo rosso, mint sprigs on everything, grilled goat's cheese as the sole vegetarian option, Exxon Valdez-sized slicks of truffle oil, and the ubiquity of balsamic vinegar, that tomato ketchup of the contemporary kitchen and condiment of choice for chefs without a scintilla of imagination - march on in spite of my annual denunciations. At the same time, new absur-dities keep popping up with disconcerting frequency. This year, it was giganticism of menu covers. By vast, I don't mean in length, but in the sheer size of the damned things. Choosing what to eat is now like hiding behind a hoarding. What's more, hardly any restaurant is exempt from this appalling affliction; even favoured places such as the Fat Duck, and Orient could usefully downsize, but most absurdly oversized of all was the menu for Cassia Oriental, which was in inverse proportion to my pleasure at eating there. A model of how a menu can be laid out clearly and remain on a human scale was that at New End. Ingredient of the Year It should be cod, which, rumour has it, will be disappearing from our menus shortly. Fat chance - cod is the most fashionable fish among chefs at the moment; quite the little sea bass de nos jours, in fact (sea bass having lost its cachet since most of it is now farmed). Chefs in general seem to be giving in to their baser instincts. There has been a tremendous run on cheeks - veal (Ibla), ox (Lettonie), pig (New End) - all of which require what is probably the Cooking Technique of the Year: braising, the long slow cooking method that not so long ago we were told that restaurants couldn't cope with. But neither cod nor bare-faced cheek is my ingredient of the year. For sheer ubiquity, nothing beats the poached egg, be it duck's (Pug), chicken's (Cotto and many others) or quail's (Maison Novelli, Ibla), on salad, tuna tartare or asparagus, soothing, sexy and cheap. Get that poached egg on the dinner party menu right away. Dish of the Year A difficult one, this. I remember with slavering affection the plate of antipasti that I had at Ristorante Abruzzi in Rome and the monumental bollito misto at the Tre Galline in Turin. Then there was the gentle richness of a veal cutlet with goat's cheese, anchovy and almond fondue from Tom Ilic at New End, and Heston Blumenthal's crab risotto with crab ice cream, red pepper cassonade and passion fruit jelly at the Fat Duck. For a while, I was tempted to give it to the roast freshwater eel with tomatoes, Sechuan pepper sauce, leeks and asparagus that I had at the Admiralty in Somerset House. It was an outstanding number, satisfying on every count, and a wonderful use of a sadly neglected fish. In the end, however, the dish that I would most like to eat again and again was the baked ginger parkin with hot spiced treacle and rhubarb ripple ice cream, which I polished off at the Star Inn in Harome, North Yorkshire. It sings in my memory even now: tart, tasty, hefty and racy, as my notes put it. Newcomer of the Year This has been a very good year for the smaller restaurant, but to my way of thinking two have been truly outstanding - New End and the Real Greek, both in London. New End has Tom Ilic at the stove, a chap with a fine sensuous feel for the textures of each dish and a bold approach to flavour. He works within a definable European tradition, to which he brings an almost Asian sensibility. Theodore Kyriakou at the Real Greek has redefined what most of us have hitherto understood by the term \"Greek Food\", and single-handedly woken us up to its possibilities, the clarity of its flavours, its range and variety. The Real Greek also happens to be a very nice place to eat. So is New End, but I'll just give the nod to the Real Greek because it is a real revelation. Gastropub of the Year I have included this section this year not simply because of the rapid proliferation of gastropubs, but also because they represent the best and most interesting development in terms of making decent grub at decent prices accessible to the widest possible number of people. Among many reviewed and not reviewed, I was particularly delighted by the Village Pub at Barnsley, Gloucestershire, the Cow in London and the Millbrook Inn in Devon. But I really lost my heart to the Star Inn up at Harome - terrific place, terrific food and terrific people. Restaurant of the Year I won't bother beating about the bush here - it just has to be the Fat Duck at Bray. I gave the place 19.5 points out of 20, after all, and there must be a reason for that. The food was flawless and fascinating. Of course, not everybody will take to it in the same way that I did - it would be a poor show if they did - but the fact is that Heston Blumenthal is doing what no one else in the country can manage. He makes food that is genuinely exciting to eat, and genuinely delicious to boot. No, it's more than delicious - it is sensational. But it's not just about the food. There is a rare unity between the front of house and the kitchen that comes only from long association and a thorough understanding of what the other is up to. This pays particular dividends when it comes to guiding the Fat Duck novice through the particularities - even peculiarities - of the menu. I just love the place, simple as that.",

It should be pointed out that our inspection of the celebrity addresses was entirely external. Indeed, the exercise should strictly have been called \"Peering down the drives of the stars' homes\". </p> <p>As our guide-driver pointed out, some of those big in what he called \"the business\" had now taken to constructing high walls to thwart such tours. Barbra was one. \"How dare she?\" roared a fan from the rear of our van. \"I paid for that house! I bought it for her! And now I've come to see it!\" </p> <p>There was a chilling logic to this view. Barbra was able to live in her big Barbie castle because people such as the lady in the van had handed over their dollars for records and cinema tickets. A shareholder in the star's fame, she had now come to claim her dividend. Stalkers lethally apply the same reasoning. </p> <p>But, while the view that you get visiting rights by buying a couple of CDs may seem an extreme one, this has essentially been the position of the British press for several years. Celebrities who allow the media into their lives for the purposes of publicity for their work are subsequently assumed to have admitted photographers and journalists to every aspect of their lives. </p> <p>More understandably, there is a particular lack of sympathy for those who sell exclusive rights to aspects of their lives to Hello! or OK! magazine. Although journalists and their readers often have very different opinions, the view is widely shared that you can't be a peacock on your wedding day and an ostrich when something goes wrong: what is known as the Posh-Becks Position. </p> <p> This is what makes so extraordinary Thursday's court of appeal ruling that, in Lord Justice Sedley's words, \"the law recognises and will appropriately protect a right of personal privacy\". Many cases - Euan Blair's late night West End adventure, the identity of the killer Mary Bell, the identity of the parents of conjoined twins - might have been expected to prompt this influential ruling. </p> <p>Instead, the rebuke to media intrusion follows from the anger of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones that their exclusive deal with OK! magazine for wedding pictures was breached by the rival Hello!. The judges seem even to have accepted a vain part of the claim: that the unauthorised images had not been vetted and retouched in the way the couple wanted. And so there is now legal precedent not only for a right of privacy, and a right to surrender that privacy to the bidder you choose but also apparently a right to enhance the image of you which the public sees. </p> <p>Senior British judges can almost certainly be relied on not to know who Madonna and Guy Ritchie are but it is strangely perfect timing that the judgment should have been handed down on the eve of another wedding made in magazine heaven: one which overshadows even the trans-atlantic match of Douglas and Zeta-Jones. </p> <p>The event at which Ms Ciccone becomes Mrs Ritchie indicates in several ways the nature of the age. It shows that - as the spacing of the Windsor generations leaves the British media in a long gap without a royal wedding - celebrities have indeed become the new kings and queens. And, like one of those tactical marriages between the great royal houses of Europe, this unlikely union in a Scottish castle seems designed to give Britain a share of celebrity and America a little of the class system. </p> <p>But the Madonna marriage also shows the complicated games of access which stars play. A star whose career has consisted of theatrical reinventions constructs a wedding - ancient castle, choir of pop legends, celebrity guests - which seems as geared to public viewing as most movies. A woman known to all by the Virgin Mary's name weds about as close to Christmas Day as is legally possible. And yet she announces that the ceremony will be private, with images released later at the couple's discretion. However, in a scrap to fans, the Christening of the couple's child will take place in public. This, in an essence, is the Hello!/OK! culture: now you see me, now you don't. </p> <p>Admittedly, stars on this scale can be excused a little illogic, so horrible are their lives. The general contempt aimed, for example, at David Beckham and Victoria Adams fails to acknowledge the unprecedented unpleasantness of modern celebrity: always fearing the long lens, the phone tap, even ultimately the gun. </p> <p>There's another image I remember from that gawper's morning in Los Angeles: the terrified eyes of the elderly wife of a veteran American comic as she drew her curtains at the sight of our van at the end of her drive. Now the courts have helped stars to pull across their shades in a more formal way. It might be a sensible reaction to a world of paparazzi and stalkers but celebrities are going to have to adjust their behaviour. It can't be striptease one minute and dark glasses the next. There's a difference between a right to privacy and a right to choose which media high-bidder you'll expose yourself to. If these hypocrisies are not acknowledged, then fans and tabloid editors will understandably shout, like the Streisandite outside the star's house: We paid for that! We paid for that! </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Celebrities who allow the media into their lives for the purposes of publicity for their work are subsequently assumed to have admitted photographers and journalists to every aspect of their lives. More understandably, there is a particular lack of sympathy for those who sell exclusive rights to aspects of their lives to Hello! or OK! magazine. Although journalists and their readers often have very different opinions, the view is widely shared that you can't be a peacock on your wedding day and an ostrich when something goes wrong: what is known as the Posh-Becks Position. This is what makes so extraordinary Thursday's court of appeal ruling that, in Lord Justice Sedley's words, \"the law recognises and will appropriately protect a right of personal privacy\". Many cases - Euan Blair's late night West End adventure, the identity of the killer Mary Bell, the identity of the parents of conjoined twins - might have been expected to prompt this influential ruling. Instead, the rebuke to media intrusion follows from the anger of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones that their exclusive deal with OK! magazine for wedding pictures was breached by the rival Hello!. The judges seem even to have accepted a vain part of the claim: that the unauthorised images had not been vetted and retouched in the way the couple wanted. And so there is now legal precedent not only for a right of privacy, and a right to surrender that privacy to the bidder you choose but also apparently a right to enhance the image of you which the public sees. Senior British judges can almost certainly be relied on not to know who Madonna and Guy Ritchie are but it is strangely perfect timing that the judgment should have been handed down on the eve of another wedding made in magazine heaven: one which overshadows even the trans-atlantic match of Douglas and Zeta-Jones. The event at which Ms Ciccone becomes Mrs Ritchie indicates in several ways the nature of the age. It shows that - as the spacing of the Windsor generations leaves the British media in a long gap without a royal wedding - celebrities have indeed become the new kings and queens. And, like one of those tactical marriages between the great royal houses of Europe, this unlikely union in a Scottish castle seems designed to give Britain a share of celebrity and America a little of the class system. But the Madonna marriage also shows the complicated games of access which stars play. A star whose career has consisted of theatrical reinventions constructs a wedding - ancient castle, choir of pop legends, celebrity guests - which seems as geared to public viewing as most movies. A woman known to all by the Virgin Mary's name weds about as close to Christmas Day as is legally possible. And yet she announces that the ceremony will be private, with images released later at the couple's discretion. However, in a scrap to fans, the Christening of the couple's child will take place in public. This, in an essence, is the Hello!/OK! culture: now you see me, now you don't. Admittedly, stars on this scale can be excused a little illogic, so horrible are their lives. The general contempt aimed, for example, at David Beckham and Victoria Adams fails to acknowledge the unprecedented unpleasantness of modern celebrity: always fearing the long lens, the phone tap, even ultimately the gun. There's another image I remember from that gawper's morning in Los Angeles: the terrified eyes of the elderly wife of a veteran American comic as she drew her curtains at the sight of our van at the end of her drive. Now the courts have helped stars to pull across their shades in a more formal way. It might be a sensible reaction to a world of paparazzi and stalkers but celebrities are going to have to adjust their behaviour. It can't be striptease one minute and dark glasses the next. There's a difference between a right to privacy and a right to choose which media high-bidder you'll expose yourself to. If these hypocrisies are not acknowledged, then fans and tabloid editors will understandably shout, like the Streisandite outside the star's house: We paid for that! We paid for that! comment@theguardian.com",

It's been pointed out in their defence that these entrepreneurs did originally take on a huge financial risk.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush has been forced to delay the announcement of his new defence secretary after acrimonious behind-the-scenes battles between the Republican party's pragmatic and conservative wings over who should get the key Pentagon job. Earlier this week it had appeared that Mr Bush was likely to select a strong conservative, former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, to a post which would include overseeing the introduction of the controversial missile defence shield programme. However, since Mr Bush met Mr Coats in Washington on Monday, the president-elect has come under increasing pressure to appoint Paul Wolfowitz, a favourite of the Republican foreign policy establishment and a former Asia expert in the Reagan era. As a result of the standoff between supporters of the rival candidates, Mr Bush is looking again at other options, including Donald Rice, who was secretary of the air force during the Gulf war in George Bush Sr's administration. Two other names who have come back into the frame as outsiders for the Pentagon job are Richard Armitage, another Reagan and Bush Sr veteran, and the former Democratic senator Sam Nunn, who chaired the Senate armed services committee during the Gulf war. Pressure on Mr Bush to select Mr Coats has come from Republican conservatives who admired his campaign in the Senate in 1993 against Bill Clinton's policy allowing gays to serve in the US military, and from congressional Republican leaders such as Senator Trent Lott, who see him as a man committed to high spending on defence. Support for Mr Wolfowitz has come from the vice-president-elect, Dick Cheney, himself a former defence secretary. Mr Wolfowitz was senior foreign policy adviser to Mr Cheney when he was in charge of the Pentagon, and has been an important tutor to Mr Bush on international issues. Mr Bush is reported to have been disappointed with Mr Coats when the two men met this week, and to believe that Mr Wolfowitz may not have the administrative and political clout to control the Pentagon's perpetually warring factions. \"I would characterise my search as deliberate,\" Mr Bush said when asked about the delay in making the appointment at an Austin press conference yesterday. \"When I make my mind up, people will know that my decision is not not based upon politics or who's in favour in some political organisation or not, but it's going to be based upon what's right for the country.\" The battle for the Pentagon job suggests such claims must be taken with a pinch of salt. Mr Bush is having to perform an increasingly delicate balancing act as he constructs his administration. In Republican terms, he has appointed moderates to key positions in his foreign policy team so far, with Colin Powell as secretary of state and Condoleezza Rice as his principal White House adviser. Party conservatives want the Pentagon job to go to someone from their wing of the party. On the domestic front, Mr Bush's balancing act was in evidence yesterday when he went against predictions and appointed the former Missouri senator and rightwinger John Ashcroft as his attorney general, and the New Jersey governor and moderate Christine Todd Whitman as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.",

So I borrowed heavily against my expected income stream from the shopping malls and piled into equities. And simultaneous with their subsequent tumble, I've suffered from the weakness of the euro. It was my decision to tie our North Pole currency, the I-Sickle, to the euro on its launch last year. Now I've got to fund the costs of presents for the world from my euro income. If only those darned Americans would scale back expectations to reflect my reduced purchasing power. Fat chance of that! So I've been faced with a clear choice. Cut back on the quality and quantity of this year's presents. Or dip into reserves and pray that next year takes care of itself. You won't be surprised to hear that I've gone for the eyes shut, fingers crossed option. It is Christmas, after all. Into the sleigh once more, my friends!",

Debts outstanding to the UK which will be written off total \u00a3650m.</p> <p>James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, and Horst K\u00f6hler, managing director of the IMF, said they had delivered on the pledge made at the G7 summit in Okinawa in July to grant debt relief by the end of the year.</p> <p>The announcement came less than 10 days before the formal winding up of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which was set up in 1996 with the aim of persuading rich creditor nations and the international organisations to write off the debts of poor nations.</p> <p>Ann Pettifor, director of Jubilee 2000, said: \"The debt relief scheme is beginning to move but debt payments will still be too high. Unless the G7 rewrite the rules there is no chance of this scheme providing an end to the debt crisis for the poorest countries.\"</p> <p>Although Jubilee 2000 will come to an end on December 31, the campaign will continue under a new name, Drop the Debt. Campaigners said they wanted deeper relief for those countries already helped, a widening of the scheme for those nations left without assistance, and reforms of the international system to ensure no repetition of the debt crisis.</p> <p>Mr Wolfensohn and Mr K\u00f6hler pledged that the bank and fund would continue working to bring debt relief to countries that have yet to qualify for hel p under the heavily indebted poor country initiative. There were 41 poor countries originally designated as in need of relief, but Mr Wolfensohn and Mr K\u00f6hler said that in many cases countries had to put an end to civil wars or external conflicts before they could be helped.</p> <p>They also stressed that the next stage for those countries given financial assistance was to channel the money into anti-poverty programmes. \"To ensure that the relief is translated into poverty reduction, the beneficiary countries must continue with their economic, social and governance reforms, and will need to design and implement nationally owned poverty reduction strategies,\" they said.</p> <p>\"But the international community must play its full part to improve the lot of poor countries, for there cannot be a good future for the rich nations if the poor nations do not share prosperity.</p> <p>\"More broadly, we call upon industrial countries to raise their official development assistance towards internationally agreed levels. And we urge them to open their markets to the exports of the poor countries, giving them a better chance to succeed on their own.\"</p> <p>Britain, which has been at the forefront of attempts to secure a more generous deal for poor countries, welcomed the news. A joint statement from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the international development secretary, Clare Short, said that the international community had exceeded its target. \"On average these countries' debts will be reduced by two thirds.</p> <p>\"More importantly, this action has enabled us to take forward our efforts to tackle the extreme poverty which affects the lives of so many millions of people in these countries. We must create a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic growth.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The 22 countries are : Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</p>",

The announcement came less than 10 days before the formal winding up of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which was set up in 1996 with the aim of persuading rich creditor nations and the international organisations to write off the debts of poor nations. Ann Pettifor, director of Jubilee 2000, said: \"The debt relief scheme is beginning to move but debt payments will still be too high. Unless the G7 rewrite the rules there is no chance of this scheme providing an end to the debt crisis for the poorest countries.\" Although Jubilee 2000 will come to an end on December 31, the campaign will continue under a new name, Drop the Debt. Campaigners said they wanted deeper relief for those countries already helped, a widening of the scheme for those nations left without assistance, and reforms of the international system to ensure no repetition of the debt crisis. Mr Wolfensohn and Mr K\u00f6hler pledged that the bank and fund would continue working to bring debt relief to countries that have yet to qualify for hel p under the heavily indebted poor country initiative. There were 41 poor countries originally designated as in need of relief, but Mr Wolfensohn and Mr K\u00f6hler said that in many cases countries had to put an end to civil wars or external conflicts before they could be helped. They also stressed that the next stage for those countries given financial assistance was to channel the money into anti-poverty programmes. \"To ensure that the relief is translated into poverty reduction, the beneficiary countries must continue with their economic, social and governance reforms, and will need to design and implement nationally owned poverty reduction strategies,\" they said. \"But the international community must play its full part to improve the lot of poor countries, for there cannot be a good future for the rich nations if the poor nations do not share prosperity. \"More broadly, we call upon industrial countries to raise their official development assistance towards internationally agreed levels. And we urge them to open their markets to the exports of the poor countries, giving them a better chance to succeed on their own.\" Britain, which has been at the forefront of attempts to secure a more generous deal for poor countries, welcomed the news. A joint statement from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the international development secretary, Clare Short, said that the international community had exceeded its target. \"On average these countries' debts will be reduced by two thirds. \"More importantly, this action has enabled us to take forward our efforts to tackle the extreme poverty which affects the lives of so many millions of people in these countries. We must create a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic growth.\" \u0095 The 22 countries are : Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.",

      "bodyText": "Serbia has wiped the names of 900,000 Kosovan Albanians from the voting register ahead of today's parliamentary election in an unprecedented and highly controversial move that spells independence or partition for the southern province. The decision to erase the names boosts the Kosovan Albanian bid for independence and appears to be at odds with Belgrade's continued claim to Kosovo, in which it cites UN resolution 1244, which says Kosovo remains \"a part of sovereign Yugoslavia\". Today's parliamentary election should mark the end of the Slobodan Milosevic era; stamping out the former strongman's lingering influence on the government has been the focus of the new ruling coalition under the Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, ever since it gained power during October's popular uprising. Every opinion poll shows Mr Kostunica's coalition, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), storming to victory. It is expected to gain as many as three-quarters of the seats in parliament. Mr Milosevic's Socialists are projected to gain just a handful of seats and 13% of the vote. The future status of Kosovo is a sensitive and unresolved regional and international issue - and Belgrade's move is seen as its first recognition, in institutional terms, that Albanians in Kosovo have a separate status. Sonja Biserko, the Belgrade-based president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, said the move will put Kosovo on the road to partition. A US analyst, who did not wish to give his name, agreed: \"It is clear that Serbia is willing to write off Kosovo. It is recognition that the best Serbia can hope for is partition along the Ibar river.\" The Ibar runs through northern Kosovo and divides the Serb and Albanian communities in Mitrovice. Spokesmen in Belgrade vehemently deny that the move advances independence or partition, claiming they were forced to abandon organising the election in the Albanian parts of Kosovo be cause the Nato-led force, K-For, would not guarantee security if polling occurred. \"K-For officials said they could not assure security for voting,\" said one Belgrade source. \"They said this in the formal meeting with the Republic Election Commission.\" \"K-For said they were afraid formal organisation of elections in parts of Kosovo where there are only Albanians would be viewed as a provocation.\" Cedomir Jovanovic, a spokesman for Serbia's prime minister-designate, Zoran Djindjic, said Belgrade had set up just 50 polling stations in the province, in the Serb-dominated areas of Leposavic, Mitrovice, Lipljan and Zvecan. He denied that this would affect Kosovo's future status, saying: \"Serbia needs democratic government so that we can solve the Kosovo problem differently to Slobodan Milosevic.\" Kosovan Albanians do not fully use their votes, he said, and Belgrade was trying to avoid a repeat of the voting fraud that occurred under Mr Milosevic, when he allegedly abused the unused Kosovo-Albanian votes. The move to strike voters off the register, however, is unprecedented. According to Professor Dragor Hiber, the vice-president of Belgrade's Civil Alliance party, today will be the first time elections have bypassed the all-Albanian parts of Kosovo. \"And for the first time, the voters are not registered on the voters list. \"That's not constitutionally correct because the Albanians are Serb and Yugoslav citizens.\" Another senior federal minister, Boris Tadic, said that excluding the names from the register was a very bad solution to the problem of voting security in the Albanian-dominated parts of Kosovo.",

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles became embroiled in the highly partisan dispute over the European Union yesterday when a senior Liberal Democrat told him to mind his own \"bloody business\" after the prince reportedly voiced concerns about the proposed European rapid reaction force. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence and foreign affairs spokesman, warned him not to be drawn into making political statements. His comments came after allies of the prince, a former Royal Navy officer who holds a number of honorary military posts, leaked his concerns to the Daily Mail, to the annoyance of Labour ministers and their Liberal Democrat allies. The Mail reported that the prince had privately told friends of his \"anxieties\" that the new European force could undermine the special relationship between Britain and the US. \"If these reports are true, as Prince Philip might well have said, 'it's none of his bloody business',\" Mr Campbell said. \"Prince Charles should not stray into the political arena on this or any other issue.\" Mr Campbell rejected any suggestion that the new force, which was agreed at the EU summit in Nice this month, could undermine the central role of Nato as the guarantor of Europe's defence. \"An effective European defence policy will preserve the security of the UK and reinforce the effectiveness of Nato,\" he said. According to the Mail, the prince expressed concern that the Americans might be unwilling to exchange intelligence with Britain if it was part of the European force, for fear that it could be leaked by other EU states, particularly France. There were strong indications last night that Paul Dacre, editor of the Mail, had been the conduit for remarks made privately by Prince Charles.

      "bodyText": "Eight prisons across Britain have begun preparations to detain up to 500 asylum seekers as a \"temporary measure\" that will last at least until the end of next year, the prison service confirmed yesterday. The prisons involved, Belmarsh, Blundeston, Highdown, Holme House, Lincoln, Liverpool, Wandsworth and Winchester, will be expected each to hold about 50 immigration detainees alongside inmates on remand, despite a long-standing Home Office policy aimed at reducing the number of asylum seekers held in jails. The prison service said yesterday the extra places were in addition to the 900 detainees already held in purpose-built immigration detention centres at Campsfield House near Oxford, Tinsley House at Gatwick airport and at Harmondsworth near Heathrow. The official confirmation came as new figures show that a record number of asylum applications are expected to be made in Britain this year, despite the move to a system of dispersal outside London and support provided through vouchers instead of cash. The latest Home Office figures show that asylum applications rose to 7,250 last month from 6,970 in October. Iraq (1,150 applicants), Iran (735) and Sri Lanka (650) were the main countries of origin. The Home Office monthly asylum figures also show that the \u00a3600m exercise to tackle the backlog of applicants - some of whom have waited more than three years for a decision - led to a record number of decisions last month, with 11,645 cases resolved. The backlog stands at 69,870 compared with 103,495 at the beginning of the year. The Home Office says the sharp increase in the use of detention will mainly be used to hold people who face removal from Britain. Some will be failed asylum seekers, but others have been detained as illegal migrants or face deportation as a result of criminal convictions. \"While our policy remains that we prefer to use detention centres rather than prison places, we have not yet got the extra detention places that we need,\" said a Home Office spokeswoman.",

Calcutta!, Ken Tynan's infamous full-frontal nude revue which was widely attacked as the point at which the \"permissive 60s\" had gone too far, was saved from prosecution by the secret testimony of two London headmistresses, both distinguished Dames.</p> <p>It was widely assumed at the time that the police had refused to prosecute the show's now famous producer, Michael White, because they thought it harmless.</p> <p>But the confidential Metropolitan police files released exclusively to the Guardian at the public record office show that the obscene publications squad was so keen to close down Tynan's sex romp that members went to see it three times - twice undercover - before demanding that the attorney general take action.</p> <p>The show sparked a furious debate in the press after its opening in 1970. The Dowager Lady Birdwood, a notorious figure on the far right of politics, called for it to be banned and she and her allies registered complaints with the police.</p> <p>But unknown to the public the director of public prosecutions sent a panel of experts to resolve this \"muck or freedom\" debate.

      "bodyText": "Oh! Calcutta!, Ken Tynan's infamous full-frontal nude revue which was widely attacked as the point at which the \"permissive 60s\" had gone too far, was saved from prosecution by the secret testimony of two London headmistresses, both distinguished Dames. It was widely assumed at the time that the police had refused to prosecute the show's now famous producer, Michael White, because they thought it harmless. But the confidential Metropolitan police files released exclusively to the Guardian at the public record office show that the obscene publications squad was so keen to close down Tynan's sex romp that members went to see it three times - twice undercover - before demanding that the attorney general take action. The show sparked a furious debate in the press after its opening in 1970. The Dowager Lady Birdwood, a notorious figure on the far right of politics, called for it to be banned and she and her allies registered complaints with the police. But unknown to the public the director of public prosecutions sent a panel of experts to resolve this \"muck or freedom\" debate. It included two eminent headmistresses, a professor of law and a vicar from Feltham. Turning stereotyping on its head, Dame Mary Green, 57, the headmistress of Kidbroke school, south London, was in no doubt of her feelings: \"The women in the play were lovely and seemed unspoilt, with a healthy freshness _ I was neither shocked nor embarrassed.\" Her colleague, Dame Margaret Miles, 59, found fault only with the length of some scenes, which she thought overlong. Tynan, then the iconoclastic theatre critic of the Observer, and notorious as the first man to use the word fuck on British television, saw his musical revue as an \"experiment in elegant erotica\".

Luff dismissed John Lennon's Four in Hand sketch about a masturbation club with the single word \"dirt\" and condemned a sketch called Delicious Indignities, which featured Booth, as \"pathetic, unjustifiable, appalling pornography\", although he did concede: \"acting good\". Luff went twice more to confirm his impressions, reporting that the lighting had improved between performances but that the sound reproduction remained poor. \"Sex is not dealt with with respect, man is depicted as a performing dog self-indulgently satisfying every whim and fancy thereby debasing any form of dignity and attacking the very roots of the family unit,\" reported Luff, asking the attorney general, Sir Peter Rawlinson, to prosecute under the 1968 Theatres Act.

Under the plan discussed by negotiators at Bolling air force base in Washington, the Palestinians would have sovereignty over the parts of the city they occupy. \"We are close to achieving recognition of Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem, including the holy sites,\" said a Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo. Israel appears also to have softened its claims to the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif. Its foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said in a radio interview that Israel wished only to preserve its \"special affinity\" with the area. By yesterday, the initial optimism had evaporated and the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, intervened to try to keep the talks on track. President Bill Clinton was also ready to step in if necessary. Saeb Erekat, one of the more pessimistic members of the Palestinian team, was reported as saying there were \"deep differences over all issues\". But an American official played down the problems. \"We remain encouraged by the commitment shown by the parties and their openness to try to find a solution,\" he said. Sources close to the talks warned that discussions so far had dealt only with broad outlines: there could be serious disagreements when it came to details, such as how control over Jerusalem might be shared in practice. In return for concessions on Jerusalem, Israel wants the Palestinians to abandon their insistence on the right of refugees to return to their homes in Israel. Although the Palestinian negotiators regard this as a big issue of principle in which they are supported by UN security council resolution 194, they acknowledge that most of the 4m refugees would probably not want to live in Israel. One possible fudge would be to allow a return to their \"homeland\", which could be interpreted as resettlement in a future Palestinian state. The latest Israeli moves will anger those - including the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon - who regard Jerusalem as their \"undivided\" capital. But the Labour prime minister, Ehud Barak, is calculating that in the election on February 6 voters will value a final settlement with the Palestinians more highly than sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem. It emerged yesterday that both sides at the talks had come close to blows on Thursday in a dispute over the amount of occupied territory to be retained by Israel. \"A crisis emerged between the negotiators when Israeli negotiator Shlomo Ben-Ami returned to talking about annexing 10% of the Palestinian territories when they had earlier offered 5%,\" a senior Palestinian official said. \"There was almost a fistfight.\" Israel wants to retain major settlements in the occupied territories; these house about 80% of the Jewish settlers. It is offering some Israeli land in exchange. The Palestinians insist that any new land must be equal in quantity and quality. The easiest and most likely option from the Israeli viewpoint is to transfer parts of the Negev desert to the crowded territory of Gaza. But the Negev quality might be poor. In the occupied territories yesterday, a Palestinian suicide bomber walked into a restaurant at the Jewish settlement of Mehola, 75 miles north-east of Jerusalem, and blew himself up, killing one Israeli.

You could say that Carrey was continuing the tradition started by horror star Lon Chaney - but the point of Chaney was that no one knew or cared what he looked like offscreen. More importantly, Chaney's appeal was based not only on make-up but on the pliability of his body - as in The Unknown, where he perfected the art of knife-throwing with his feet. </p> <p>The Grinch belongs to a recent strain of Hollywood comic-strip cinema in which the point is that stars be unrecognisable. The first and weirdest example of the 1990s was Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy, which made literal use of the distortions of Chester Gould's comic strip to transform Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino into ugly mobsters. The Grinch similarly translates a famous cartoon style into three dimensions, with bizarre literalness. </p> <p>But prosthetic make-up can be expressive precisely in the way it limits the body - it becomes a sort of wearable assault course. In Channel 4's Neanderthal, there was a scientific reason for the make-up design: research showed that big noses were required to allow Neanderthal nostrils to stay warm. In theory there could have been anyone under the furry eyebrows, yet the make-up meant nothing without the cast's own physical attributes and performance skills - they had to have short limbs and be willing to wade in swamps. In The Grinch, only Carrey is required to use his prosthetics in a similarly athletic way. </p> <p>His job is to escape from the prison of his costume - and this is what makes the film, in spite of its marshmallow monotony, watchable. Against all odds, an unmistakable Carreyness makes it through the latex. The film becomes a test case for star quality. You can't see Carrey, but you can see his signature - his way of inhabiting space, his rhythm. A single scene of The Grinch shows you you're not watching Robin Williams. </p> <p>Critics who mull over directors' styles often wonder what it would be like if you took film-makers known for elaborate productions - Tim Burton, say - and obliged them to make a no-frills exercise, Dogma-style. Would the result be unrecognisable, or would you end up with the essence of their directing styles? Carrey has been set much the same challenge in The Grinch. He can't rely on his gross-out schtick in this nursery world, nor on gurning, because he can only do the facial expressions that the make-up permits. So he works within the limits of what his new body allows him to do, and for better or for worse, the ineffable Carrey signature comes through.

      "body": "<p>When Alan Ayckbourn first staged Bedroom Farce a quarter of a century ago, it was such a big production that he couldn't fit three double beds onto the Scarborough Library Theatre stage. Anyone who thinks Ayckbourn has always represented box office gold dust should remember that putting it on at all meant evicting a third of the audience. </p> <p>It's still a bit of a squeeze in the McCarthy auditorium, the smaller of the two spaces in Ayckbourn's Stephen Joseph Theatre, the converted cinema complex in Scarborough where the playwright is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his classic pyjama caper. It's good to know some things never change - for the celebrated pilchard-eating scene, the poor fish probably still had more room for manoeuvre inside the tin. </p> <p>Part of the inspiration for the play came from the communal, boarding-house living associated with the original Scarborough repertory company. It was in this environment that a tedious actor with a stack of personal problems once trailed Ayckbourn into his bedroom and continued with his litany of woe even though the director had put the lights out. </p> <p>Ironically, it was the need to make something big enough to occupy the National Theatre's Lyttleton stage that prompted Ayckbourn to come up with the three-bed trick. Today, it would probably save space to list the countries and languages Bedroom Farce hasn't been performed in or translated into: the Polish and Norwegian productions must have been a temptingly surreal prospect, but the author candidly admits that until preparing for this production he hadn't even seen, let alone read the piece since 1975. </p> <p>This does lead you to wonder why there is such a pressing need for Ayckbourn to revisit his past now. Perhaps it's because the play has acquired a patina of kitsch. Maybe it's simply a sure-fire way of filling seats in what has been a boldly conceived yet under- appreciated new theatre.

      "bodyText": "When Alan Ayckbourn first staged Bedroom Farce a quarter of a century ago, it was such a big production that he couldn't fit three double beds onto the Scarborough Library Theatre stage. Anyone who thinks Ayckbourn has always represented box office gold dust should remember that putting it on at all meant evicting a third of the audience. It's still a bit of a squeeze in the McCarthy auditorium, the smaller of the two spaces in Ayckbourn's Stephen Joseph Theatre, the converted cinema complex in Scarborough where the playwright is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his classic pyjama caper. It's good to know some things never change - for the celebrated pilchard-eating scene, the poor fish probably still had more room for manoeuvre inside the tin. Part of the inspiration for the play came from the communal, boarding-house living associated with the original Scarborough repertory company. It was in this environment that a tedious actor with a stack of personal problems once trailed Ayckbourn into his bedroom and continued with his litany of woe even though the director had put the lights out. Ironically, it was the need to make something big enough to occupy the National Theatre's Lyttleton stage that prompted Ayckbourn to come up with the three-bed trick. Today, it would probably save space to list the countries and languages Bedroom Farce hasn't been performed in or translated into: the Polish and Norwegian productions must have been a temptingly surreal prospect, but the author candidly admits that until preparing for this production he hadn't even seen, let alone read the piece since 1975. This does lead you to wonder why there is such a pressing need for Ayckbourn to revisit his past now. Perhaps it's because the play has acquired a patina of kitsch. Maybe it's simply a sure-fire way of filling seats in what has been a boldly conceived yet under- appreciated new theatre. Surely the last thing Ayckbourn wanted the new Stephen Joseph Theatre to become was a living museum dedicated to his glorious past. Whatever the motive, the tactile combination of four couples spread over three bedrooms is still enough to ensure that sparks fly, though whether from character and situation or the sheer acreage of nasty 1970s polyester is difficult to tell.

      "body": "<p>The letters which I now publish were sent to me recently by a person who knows me to be interested in ghost stories. There is no doubt about their authenticity. The paper on which they are written, the ink, and the whole external aspect put their date beyond the reach of question. </p> <p>The only point which they do not make clear is the identity of the writer. He signs with initials only, and as none of the envelopes of the letters are preserved, the surname of his correspondent - obviously a married brother - is as obscure as his own. No further preliminary explanation is needed, I think. Luckily the first letter supplies all that could be expected. </p> <p><strong> Letter I</strong> <br> Great Chrishall, Dec. 22, 1837. </p> <p>My Dear Robert, <br> It is with great regret for the enjoyment I am losing, and for a reason which you will deplore equally with myself, that I write to inform you that I am unable to join your circle for this Christmas; but you will agree with me that it is unavoidable when I say that I have within these few hours received a letter from Mrs Hunt at B-, to the effect that our Uncle Henry has suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, and begging me to go down there immediately and join the search that is being made for him. </p> <p>Little as I, or you either, I think, have ever seen of Uncle, I naturally feel that this is not a request that can be regarded lightly, and accordingly I propose to go to B- by this afternoon's mail, reaching it late in the evening. I shall not go to the Rectory, but put up at the King's Head, and to which you may address letters. I enclose a small draft, which you will please make use of for the benefit of the young people. I shall write you daily (supposing me to be detained more than a single day) what goes on, and you may be sure, should the business be cleared up in time to permit of my coming to the Manor after all, I shall present myself. I have but a few minutes at disposal. With cordial greetings to you all, and many regrets, believe me, your affectionate Bro.,<br> W. R. </p> <p><strong> Letter II</strong> <br> King's Head, Dec. 23, '37. </p> <p>My Dear Robert, <br> In the first place, there is as yet no news of Uncle H., and I think you may finally dismiss any idea - I won't say hope - that I might after all \"turn up\" for Xmas. However, my thoughts will be with you, and you have my best wishes for a really festive day. Mind that none of my nephews or nieces expend any fraction of their guineas on presents for me. </p> <p>Since I got here I have been blaming myself for taking this affair of Uncle H. too easily. From what people here say, I gather that there is very little hope that he can still be alive; but whether it is accident or design that carried him off I cannot judge. The facts are these. On Friday the 19th, he went as usual shortly before five o'clock to read evening prayers at the Church; and when they were over the clerk brought him a message, in response to which he set off to pay a visit to a sick person at an outlying cottage the better part of two miles away. He paid the visit, and started on his return journey at about half-past six. This is the last that is known of him. The people here are very much grieved at his loss; he had been here many years, as you know, and though, as you also know, he was not the most genial of men, and had more than a little of the martinet in his composition, he seems to have been active in good works, and unsparing of trouble to himself. </p> <p>Poor Mrs Hunt, who has been his housekeeper ever since she left Woodley, is quite overcome: it seems like the end of the world to her. I am glad that I did not entertain the idea of taking quarters at the Rectory; and I have declined several kindly offers of hospitality from people in the place, preferring as I do to be independent, and finding myself very comfortable here. </p> <p>You will, of course, wish to know what has been done in the way of inquiry and search. First, nothing was to be expected from investigation at the Rectory; and to be brief, nothing has transpired. I asked Mrs Hunt - as others had done before - whether there was either any unfavourable symptom in her master such as might portend a sudden stroke, or attack of illness, or whether he had ever had reason to apprehend any such thing: but both she, and also his medical man, were clear that this was not the case. He was quite in his usual health. In the second place, naturally, ponds and streams have been dragged, and fields in the neighbourhood which he is known to have visited last, have been searched - without result. I have myself talked to the parish clerk and - more important - have been to the house where he paid his visit. </p> <p>There can be no question of any foul play on these people's part. The one man in the house is ill in bed and very weak: the wife and the children of course could do nothing themselves, nor is there the shadow of a probability that they or any of them should have agreed to decoy poor Uncle H. out in order that he might be attacked on the way back. They had told what they knew to several other inquirers already, but the woman repeated it to me. The Rector was looking just as usual: he wasn't very long with the sick man - \"He ain't,\" she said, \"like some what has a gift in prayer; but there, if we was all that way, 'owever would the chapel people get their living?\" He left some money when he went away, and one of the children saw him cross the stile into the next field. He was dressed as he always was: wore his bands - I gather he is nearly the last man remaining who does so - at any rate in this district. </p> <p>You see I am putting down everything. The fact is that I have nothing else to do, having brought no business papers with me; and, moreover, it serves to clear my own mind, and may suggest points which have been overlooked. So I shall continue to write all that passes, even to conversations if need be - you may read or not as you please, but pray keep the letters. I have another reason for writing so fully, but it is not a very tangible one. </p> <p>You may ask if I have myself made any search in the fields near the cottage. Something - a good deal - has been done by others, as I mentioned; but I hope to go over the ground tomorrow. Bow Street has now been informed, and will send down by tonight's coach, but I do not think they will make much of the job. There is no snow, which might have helped us. The fields are all grass. Of course I was on the qui vive for any indication today both going and returning; but there was a thick mist on the way back, and I was not in trim for wandering about unknown pastures, especially on an evening when bushes looked like men, and a cow lowing in the distance might have been the last trump. I assure you, if Uncle Henry had stepped out from among the trees in a little copse which borders the path at one place, carrying his head under his arm, I should have been very little more uncomfortable than I was. To tell you the truth, I was rather expecting something of the kind. But I must drop my pen for the moment: Mr Lucas, the curate, is announced. </p> <p>Later. Mr Lucas has been, and gone, and there is not much beyond the decencies of ordinary sentiment to be got from him. I can see that he has given up any idea that the Rector can be alive, and that, so far as he can be, he is truly sorry. I can also discern that even in a more emotional person than Mr Lucas, Uncle Henry was not likely to inspire strong attachment. </p> <p>Besides Mr Lucas, I have had another visitor in the shape of my Boniface - mine host of the \"King's Head\" - who came to see whether I had everything I wished, and who really requires the pen of a Boz to do him justice. He was very solemn and weighty at first. \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I suppose we must bow our 'ead beneath the blow, as my poor wife had used to say. So far as I can gather there's been neither hide nor yet hair of our late respected incumbent scented out as yet; not that he was what the Scripture terms a hairy man in any sense of the word.\" </p> <p>I said - as well as I could - that I supposed not, but could not help adding that I had heard he was sometimes a little difficult to deal with. Mr Bowman looked at me sharply for a moment, and then passed in a flash from solemn sympathy to impassioned declamation. \"When I think,\" he said, \"of the language that man see fit to employ to me in this here parlour over no more a matter than a cask of beer - such a thing as I told him might happen any day of the week to a man with a family - though as it turned out he was quite under a mistake, and that I knew at the time, only I was that shocked to hear him I couldn't lay my tongue to the right expression.\" </p> <p>He stopped abruptly and eyed me with some embarrassment. I only said, \"Dear me, I'm sorry to hear you had any little differences: I suppose my uncle will be a good deal missed in the parish?\" Mr Bowman drew a long breath. \"Ah, yes!\" he said; \"your uncle! You'll understand me when I say that for the moment it had slipped my remembrance that he was a relative; and natural enough, I must say, as it should, for as to you bearing any resemblance to - to him, the notion of any such a thing is clean ridiculous. All the same, 'ad I 'ave bore it in my mind, you'll be among the first to feel, I'm sure, as I should have abstained my lips, or rather I should not have abstained my lips with no such reflections.\" </p> <p>I assured him that I quite understood, and was going to have asked him some further questions, but he was called away to see after some business. By the way, you need not take it into your head that he has anything to fear from the inquiry into poor Uncle Henry's disappearance - though, no doubt, in the watches of the night it will occur to him that I think he has, and I may expect explanations tomorrow. I must close this letter: it has to go by the late coach. </p> <p><strong> Letter III</strong> <br> Dec. 25, '37. </p> <p>My Dear Robert, <br> This is a curious letter to be writing on Christmas Day, and yet after all there is nothing much in it. Or there may be - you shall be the judge. At least, nothing decisive. The Bow Street men practically say that they have no clue. The length of time and the weather conditions have made all tracks so faint as to be quite useless: nothing that belonged to the dead man - I'm afraid no other word will do - has been picked up. </p> <p>As I expected, Mr Bowman was uneasy in his mind this morning; quite early I heard him holding forth in a very distinct voice - purposely so, I thought - to the Bow Street officers in the bar, as to the loss that the town had sustained in their Rector, and as to the necessity of leaving no stone unturned (he was very great on this phrase) in order to come at the truth. I suspect him of being an orator of repute at convivial meetings. </p> <p>When I was at breakfast he came to wait on me, and took an opportunity when handing a muffin to say in a low tone, \"I 'ope, sir, you reconize as my feelings towards your relative is not actuated by any taint of what you may call melignity - you can leave the room, Eliza, I will see the gentleman 'as all he requires with my own hands - I ask your pardon, sir, but you must be well aware a man is not always master of himself: and when that man has been 'urt in his mind by the application of expressions which I will go so far as to say 'ad not ought to have been made use of (his voice was rising all this time and his face growing redder); no, sir; and 'ere, if you will permit of it, I should like to explain to you in a very few words the exact state of the bone of contention. This cask - I might more truly call it a firkin - of beer-\" </p> <p>I felt it was time to interpose, and said that I did not see that it would help us very much to go into that matter in detail. Mr Bowman acquiesced, and resumed more calmly: \"Well, sir, I bow to your ruling, and as you say, be that here or be it there, it don't contribute a great deal, perhaps, to the present question. All I wish you to understand is that I am as prepared as you are yourself to lend every hand to the business we have afore us, and - as I took the opportunity to say as much to the Orficers not three-quarters of an hour ago - to leave no stone unturned as may throw even a spark of light on this painful matter.\" </p> <p>In fact, Mr Bowman did accompany us on our exploration, but though I am sure his genuine wish was to be helpful, I am afraid he did not contribute to the serious side of it. He appeared to be under the impression that we were likely to meet either Uncle Henry or the person responsible for his disappearance, walking about the fields, and did a great deal of shading his eyes with his hand and calling our attention, by pointing with his stick, to distant cattle and labourers. He held several long conversations with old women whom we met, and was very strict and severe in his manner, but on each occasion returned to our party saying, \"Well, I find she don't seem to 'ave no connexion with this sad affair. I think you may take it from me, sir, as there's little or no light to be looked for from that quarter; not without she's keeping somethink back intentional.\" </p> <p>We gained no appreciable result, as I told you at starting; the Bow Street men have left the town, whether for London or not I am not sure. </p> <p>This evening I had company in the shape of a bagman, a smartish fellow. He knew what was going forward, but though he has been on the roads for some days about here, he had nothing to tell of suspicious characters - tramps, wandering sailors or gipsies. He was very full of a capital Punch and Judy Show he had seen this same day at W-, and asked if it had been here yet, and advised me by no means to miss it if it does come. The best Punch and the best Toby dog, he said, he had ever come across. Toby dogs, you know, are the last new thing in the shows. I have only seen one myself, but before long all the men will have them. </p> <p>Now why, you will want to know, do I trouble to write all this to you? I am obliged to do it, because it has something to do with another absurd trifle (as you will inevitably say), which in my present state of rather unquiet fancy - nothing more, perhaps - I have to put down. It is a dream, sir, which I am going to record, and I must say it is one of the oddest I have had. Is there anything in it beyond what the bagman's talk and Uncle Henry's disappearance could have suggested? You, I repeat, shall judge: I am not in a sufficiently cool and judicial frame to do so. </p> <p>It began with what I can only describe as a pulling-aside of curtains: and I found myself seated in a place - I don't know whether indoors or out. There were people - only a few - on either side of me, but I did not recognize them, or indeed think much about them. They never spoke, but, so far as I remember, were all grave and pale-faced and looked fixedly before them. Facing me there was a Punch and Judy Show, perhaps rather larger than the ordinary ones, painted with black figures on a reddish-yellow ground. Behind it and on each side was only darkness, but in front there was a sufficiency of light. I was \"strung up\" to a high degree of expectation and looked every moment to hear the pan-pipes and the Roo-too-too-it. Instead of that there came suddenly an enormous - I can use no other word - an enormous single toll of a bell, I don't know from how far off - somewhere behind. The little curtain flew up and the drama began. </p> <p>I believe someone once tried to re-write Punch as a serious tragedy; but whoever he may have been, this performance would have suited him exactly. There was something Satanic about the hero. He varied his methods of attack: for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see his horrible face - it was yellowish-white, I may remark - peering round the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch. To others he was polite and carneying - particularly to the unfortunate alien who can only say Shallabalah - though what Punch said I never could catch. But with all of them I came to dread the moment of death. The crack of the stick on their skulls, which in the ordinary way delights me, had here a crushing sound as if the bone was giving way, and the victims quivered and kicked as they lay. The baby - it sounds more ridiculous as I go on - the baby, I am sure, was alive. Punch wrung its neck, and if the choke or squeak which it gave were not real, I know nothing of reality. </p> <p>The stage got perceptibly darker as each crime was consummated, and at last there was one murder which was done quite in the dark, so that I could see nothing of the victim, and took some time to effect. It was accompanied by hard breathing and horrid muffled sounds, and after it Punch came and sat on the foot-board and fanned himself and looked at his shoes, which were bloody, and hung his head on one side, and sniggered in so deadly a fashion that I saw some of those beside me cover their faces, and I would gladly have done the same. But in the meantime the scene behind Punch was clearing, and showed, not the usual house front, but something more ambitious - a grove of trees and the gentle slope of a hill, with a very natural - in fact, I should say a real - moon shining on it. Over this there rose slowly an object which I soon perceived to be a human figure with something peculiar about the head - what, I was unable at first to see. It did not stand on its feet, but began creeping or dragging itself across the middle distance towards Punch, who still sat back to it; and by this time, I may remark (though it did not occur to me at the moment) that all pretence of this being a puppet show had vanished. Punch was still Punch, it is true, but, like the others, was in some sense a live creature, and both moved themselves at their own will. </p> <p>When I next glanced at him he was sitting in malignant reflection; but in another instant something seemed to attract his attention, and he first sat up sharply and then turned round, and evidently caught sight of the person that was approaching him and was in fact now very near. Then, indeed, did he show unmistakable signs of terror: catching up his stick, he rushed towards the wood, only just eluding the arm of his pursuer, which was suddenly flung out to intercept him. It was with a revulsion which I cannot easily express that I now saw more or less clearly what this pursuer was like. He was a sturdy figure clad in black, and, as I thought, wearing bands: his head was covered with a whitish bag. </p> <p>The chase which now began lasted I do not know how long, now among the trees, now along the slope of the field, sometimes both figures disappearing wholly for a few seconds, and only some uncertain sounds letting one know that they were still afoot. At length there came a moment when Punch, evidently exhausted, staggered in from the left and threw himself down among the trees. His pursuer was not long after him, and came looking uncertainly from side to side. Then, catching sight of the figure on the ground, he too threw himself down - his back was turned to the audience - with a swift motion twitched the covering from his head, and thrust his face into that of Punch. Everything on the instant grew dark. </p> <p>There was one long, loud, shuddering scream, and I awoke to find myself looking straight into the face of - what in all the world do you think? but - a large owl, which was seated on my window-sill immediately opposite my bed-foot, holding up its wings like two shrouded arms. I caught the fierce glance of its yellow eyes, and then it was gone. I heard the single enormous bell again - very likely, as you are saying to yourself, the church clock; but I do not think so - and then I was broad awake. </p> <p>All this, I may say, happened within the last half-hour. There was no probability of my getting to sleep again, so I got up, put on clothes enough to keep me warm, and am writing this rigmarole in the first hours of Christmas Day. Have I left out anything? Yes; there was no Toby dog, and the names over the front of the Punch and Judy booth were Kidman and Gallop, which were certainly not what the bagman told me to look out for. </p> <p>By this time, I feel a little more as if I could sleep, so this shall be sealed and wafered. </p> <p><strong> Letter IV</strong> <br> Dec. 26, '37. </p> <p>My Dear Robert, <br> All is over. The body has been found. I do not make excuses for not having sent off my news by last night's mail, for the simple reason that I was incapable of putting pen to paper. The events that attended the discovery bewildered me so completely that I needed what I could get of a night's rest to enable me to face the situation at all. Now I can give you my journal of the day, certainly the strangest Christmas Day that ever I spent or am likely to spend. </p> <p>The first incident was not very serious. Mr Bowman had, I think, been keeping Christmas Eve, and was a little inclined to be captious: at least, he was not on foot very early, and to judge from what I could hear, neither men nor maids could do anything to please him. The latter were certainly reduced to tears; nor am I sure that Mr Bowman succeeded in preserving a manly composure. At any rate, when I came downstairs, it was in a broken voice that he wished me the compliments of the season, and a little later on when he paid his visit of ceremony at breakfast, he was far from cheerful, even Byronic, I might almost say, in his outlook on life. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" he said, \"if you think with me, sir; but every Christmas as comes round the world seems a hollerer thing to me. Why, take an example now from what lays under my own eye. There's my servant Eliza - been with me now for going on 15 years. I thought I could have placed my confidence in Eliza, and yet this very morning - Christmas morning too, of all the blessed days in the year - with the bells a-ringing and - and - all like that - I say, this very morning, had it not have been for Providence watching over us all, that girl would have put - indeed I may go so far to say, 'ad put the cheese on your breakfast-table-\" He saw I was about to speak, and waved his hand at me. \"It's all very well for you to say, 'Yes, Mr Bowman, but you took away the cheese and locked it up in the cupboard,' which I did, and have the key here, or if not the actual key, one very much about the same size. That's true enough, sir, but what do you think is the effect of that action on me? Why, it's no exaggeration for me to say that the ground is cut from under my feet. And yet when I said as much to Eliza, not nasty, mind you, but just firm-like, what was my return? 'Oh,' she says, 'well,' she says, 'there wasn't no bones broke, I suppose.' Well, sir, it 'urt me, that's all I can say: it 'urt me, and I don't like to think of it now.\" </p> <p>There was an ominous pause here, in which I ventured to say something like, \"Yes, very trying,\" and then asked at what hour the church service was to be. \"Eleven o'clock,\" Mr Bowman said with a heavy sigh. \"Ah, you won't have no such discourse from poor Mr Lucas as what you would have done from our late Rector. Him and me may have had our little differences, and did do, more's the pity.\" I could see that a powerful effort was needed to keep him off the vexed question of the cask of beer, but he made it. \"But I will say this, that a better preacher, nor yet one to stand faster by his rights or what he considered to be his rights - however, that's not the question now - I for one, never set under. Some might say, 'Was he a eloquent man?' and to that my answer would be: 'Well, there you've a better right per'aps to speak of your own uncle than what I have.' Others might ask, 'Did he keep a hold of his congregation?' and there again I should reply, 'That depends.' But as I say - yes, Eliza, my girl, I'm coming - eleven o'clock, sir, and you inquire for the King's Head pew.\" I believe Eliza had been very near the door, and shall consider it in my vail. </p> <p>The next episode was church: I felt Mr Lucas had a difficult task in doing justice to Christmas sentiments, and also to the feeling of disquiet and regret which, whatever Mr Bowman might say, was clearly prevalent. I do not think he rose to the occasion. I was uncomfortable. The organ wolved - you know what I mean: the wind died - twice in the Christmas Hymn, and the tenor bell, I suppose owing to some negligence on the part of the ringers, kept sounding faintly about once in a minute during the sermon. The clerk sent up a man to see to it, but he seemed unable to do much. I was glad when it was over. There was an odd incident, too, before the service. I went in rather early, and came upon two men carrying the parish bier back to its place under the tower. From what I overheard them saying, it appeared that it had been put out by mistake, by someone who was not there. I also saw the clerk busy folding up a moth-eaten velvet pall - not a sight for Christmas Day. </p> <p>I dined soon after this, and then, feeling disinclined to go out, took my seat by the fire in the parlour, with the last number of Pickwick, which I had been saving up for some days. I thought I could be sure of keeping awake over this, but I turned out as bad as our friend Smith. I suppose it was half-past two when I was roused by a piercing whistle and laughing and talking voices outside in the market-place. It was a Punch and Judy - I had no doubt the one that my bagman had seen at W-. I was half delighted, half not - the latter because my unpleasant dream came back to me so vividly; but, anyhow, I determined to see it through, and I sent Eliza out with a crown-piece to the performers and a request that they would face my window if they could manage it. </p> <p>The show was a very smart new one; the names of the proprietors, I need hardly tell you, were Italian, Foresta and Calpigi. The Toby dog was there, as I had been led to expect. All B- turned out, but did not obstruct my view, for I was at the large first-floor window and not 10 yards away. </p> <p>The play began on the stroke of a quarter to three by the church clock. Certainly it was very good; and I was soon relieved to find that the disgust my dream had given me for Punch's onslaughts on his ill-starred visitors was only transient. I laughed at the demise of the Turncock, the Foreigner, the Beadle, and even the baby. The only drawback was the Toby dog's developing a tendency to howl in the wrong place. Something had occurred, I suppose, to upset him, and something considerable: for, I forget exactly at what point, he gave a most lamentable cry, leapt off the foot-board, and shot away across the market-place and down a side street. There was a stage-wait, but only a brief one. I suppose the men decided that it was no good going after him, and that he was likely to turn up again at night. </p> <p>We went on. Punch dealt faithfully with Judy, and in fact with all comers; and then came the moment when the gallows was erected, and the great scene with Mr Ketch was to be enacted. It was now that something happened of which I can certainly not yet see the import fully. You have witnessed an execution, and know what the criminal's head looks like with the cap on. If you are like me, you never wish to think of it again, and I do not willingly remind you of it. It was just such a head as that, that I, from my somewhat higher post, saw in the inside of the show-box; but at first the audience did not see it. I expected it to emerge into their view, but instead of that there slowly rose for a few seconds an uncovered face, with an expression of terror upon it, of which I have never imagined the like. It seemed as if the man, whoever he was, was being forcibly lifted, with his arms somehow pinioned or held back, towards the little gibbet on the stage. I could just see the nightcapped head behind him. Then there was a cry and a crash. The whole show-box fell over backwards; kicking legs were seen among the ruins, and then two figures - as some said; I can only answer for one - were visible running at top speed across the square and disappearing in a lane which leads to the fields. </p> <p>Of course everybody gave chase. I followed; but the pace was killing, and very few were in, literally, at the death. It happened in a chalk pit: the man went over the edge quite blindly and broke his neck. They searched everywhere for the other, until it occurred to me to ask whether he had ever left the market-place. At first everyone was sure that he had; but when we came to look, he was there, under the show-box, dead too. </p> <p>But in the chalk pit it was that poor Uncle Henry's body was found, with a sack over the head, the throat horribly mangled. It was a peaked corner of the sack sticking out of the soil that attracted attention. I cannot bring myself to write in greater detail. </p> <p>I forgot to say the men's real names were Kidman and Gallop. I feel sure I have heard them, but no one here seems to know anything about them. </p> <p>I am coming to you as soon as I can after the funeral. I must tell you when we meet what I think of it all. </p> <p>\u0095 The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance is from The Haunted Dolls' House and Other Stories by MR James, published by Penguin Books, price \u00a36.99. <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk\">www.penguin.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The letters which I now publish were sent to me recently by a person who knows me to be interested in ghost stories. There is no doubt about their authenticity. The paper on which they are written, the ink, and the whole external aspect put their date beyond the reach of question. The only point which they do not make clear is the identity of the writer. He signs with initials only, and as none of the envelopes of the letters are preserved, the surname of his correspondent - obviously a married brother - is as obscure as his own. No further preliminary explanation is needed, I think. Luckily the first letter supplies all that could be expected. Letter I Great Chrishall, Dec. 22, 1837. My Dear Robert, It is with great regret for the enjoyment I am losing, and for a reason which you will deplore equally with myself, that I write to inform you that I am unable to join your circle for this Christmas; but you will agree with me that it is unavoidable when I say that I have within these few hours received a letter from Mrs Hunt at B-, to the effect that our Uncle Henry has suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, and begging me to go down there immediately and join the search that is being made for him. Little as I, or you either, I think, have ever seen of Uncle, I naturally feel that this is not a request that can be regarded lightly, and accordingly I propose to go to B- by this afternoon's mail, reaching it late in the evening. I shall not go to the Rectory, but put up at the King's Head, and to which you may address letters. I enclose a small draft, which you will please make use of for the benefit of the young people. I shall write you daily (supposing me to be detained more than a single day) what goes on, and you may be sure, should the business be cleared up in time to permit of my coming to the Manor after all, I shall present myself. I have but a few minutes at disposal. With cordial greetings to you all, and many regrets, believe me, your affectionate Bro., W. R. Letter II King's Head, Dec. 23, '37. My Dear Robert, In the first place, there is as yet no news of Uncle H., and I think you may finally dismiss any idea - I won't say hope - that I might after all \"turn up\" for Xmas. However, my thoughts will be with you, and you have my best wishes for a really festive day. Mind that none of my nephews or nieces expend any fraction of their guineas on presents for me. Since I got here I have been blaming myself for taking this affair of Uncle H. too easily. From what people here say, I gather that there is very little hope that he can still be alive; but whether it is accident or design that carried him off I cannot judge. The facts are these. On Friday the 19th, he went as usual shortly before five o'clock to read evening prayers at the Church; and when they were over the clerk brought him a message, in response to which he set off to pay a visit to a sick person at an outlying cottage the better part of two miles away. He paid the visit, and started on his return journey at about half-past six. This is the last that is known of him. The people here are very much grieved at his loss; he had been here many years, as you know, and though, as you also know, he was not the most genial of men, and had more than a little of the martinet in his composition, he seems to have been active in good works, and unsparing of trouble to himself. Poor Mrs Hunt, who has been his housekeeper ever since she left Woodley, is quite overcome: it seems like the end of the world to her. I am glad that I did not entertain the idea of taking quarters at the Rectory; and I have declined several kindly offers of hospitality from people in the place, preferring as I do to be independent, and finding myself very comfortable here. You will, of course, wish to know what has been done in the way of inquiry and search. First, nothing was to be expected from investigation at the Rectory; and to be brief, nothing has transpired. I asked Mrs Hunt - as others had done before - whether there was either any unfavourable symptom in her master such as might portend a sudden stroke, or attack of illness, or whether he had ever had reason to apprehend any such thing: but both she, and also his medical man, were clear that this was not the case. He was quite in his usual health. In the second place, naturally, ponds and streams have been dragged, and fields in the neighbourhood which he is known to have visited last, have been searched - without result. I have myself talked to the parish clerk and - more important - have been to the house where he paid his visit. There can be no question of any foul play on these people's part. The one man in the house is ill in bed and very weak: the wife and the children of course could do nothing themselves, nor is there the shadow of a probability that they or any of them should have agreed to decoy poor Uncle H. out in order that he might be attacked on the way back. They had told what they knew to several other inquirers already, but the woman repeated it to me. The Rector was looking just as usual: he wasn't very long with the sick man - \"He ain't,\" she said, \"like some what has a gift in prayer; but there, if we was all that way, 'owever would the chapel people get their living?\" He left some money when he went away, and one of the children saw him cross the stile into the next field. He was dressed as he always was: wore his bands - I gather he is nearly the last man remaining who does so - at any rate in this district. You see I am putting down everything. The fact is that I have nothing else to do, having brought no business papers with me; and, moreover, it serves to clear my own mind, and may suggest points which have been overlooked. So I shall continue to write all that passes, even to conversations if need be - you may read or not as you please, but pray keep the letters. I have another reason for writing so fully, but it is not a very tangible one. You may ask if I have myself made any search in the fields near the cottage. Something - a good deal - has been done by others, as I mentioned; but I hope to go over the ground tomorrow. Bow Street has now been informed, and will send down by tonight's coach, but I do not think they will make much of the job. There is no snow, which might have helped us. The fields are all grass. Of course I was on the qui vive for any indication today both going and returning; but there was a thick mist on the way back, and I was not in trim for wandering about unknown pastures, especially on an evening when bushes looked like men, and a cow lowing in the distance might have been the last trump. I assure you, if Uncle Henry had stepped out from among the trees in a little copse which borders the path at one place, carrying his head under his arm, I should have been very little more uncomfortable than I was. To tell you the truth, I was rather expecting something of the kind. But I must drop my pen for the moment: Mr Lucas, the curate, is announced. Later. Mr Lucas has been, and gone, and there is not much beyond the decencies of ordinary sentiment to be got from him. I can see that he has given up any idea that the Rector can be alive, and that, so far as he can be, he is truly sorry. I can also discern that even in a more emotional person than Mr Lucas, Uncle Henry was not likely to inspire strong attachment. Besides Mr Lucas, I have had another visitor in the shape of my Boniface - mine host of the \"King's Head\" - who came to see whether I had everything I wished, and who really requires the pen of a Boz to do him justice. He was very solemn and weighty at first. \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I suppose we must bow our 'ead beneath the blow, as my poor wife had used to say. So far as I can gather there's been neither hide nor yet hair of our late respected incumbent scented out as yet; not that he was what the Scripture terms a hairy man in any sense of the word.\" I said - as well as I could - that I supposed not, but could not help adding that I had heard he was sometimes a little difficult to deal with. Mr Bowman looked at me sharply for a moment, and then passed in a flash from solemn sympathy to impassioned declamation. \"When I think,\" he said, \"of the language that man see fit to employ to me in this here parlour over no more a matter than a cask of beer - such a thing as I told him might happen any day of the week to a man with a family - though as it turned out he was quite under a mistake, and that I knew at the time, only I was that shocked to hear him I couldn't lay my tongue to the right expression.\" He stopped abruptly and eyed me with some embarrassment. I only said, \"Dear me, I'm sorry to hear you had any little differences: I suppose my uncle will be a good deal missed in the parish?\" Mr Bowman drew a long breath. \"Ah, yes!\" he said; \"your uncle! You'll understand me when I say that for the moment it had slipped my remembrance that he was a relative; and natural enough, I must say, as it should, for as to you bearing any resemblance to - to him, the notion of any such a thing is clean ridiculous. All the same, 'ad I 'ave bore it in my mind, you'll be among the first to feel, I'm sure, as I should have abstained my lips, or rather I should not have abstained my lips with no such reflections.\" I assured him that I quite understood, and was going to have asked him some further questions, but he was called away to see after some business. By the way, you need not take it into your head that he has anything to fear from the inquiry into poor Uncle Henry's disappearance - though, no doubt, in the watches of the night it will occur to him that I think he has, and I may expect explanations tomorrow. I must close this letter: it has to go by the late coach. Letter III Dec. 25, '37. My Dear Robert, This is a curious letter to be writing on Christmas Day, and yet after all there is nothing much in it. Or there may be - you shall be the judge. At least, nothing decisive. The Bow Street men practically say that they have no clue. The length of time and the weather conditions have made all tracks so faint as to be quite useless: nothing that belonged to the dead man - I'm afraid no other word will do - has been picked up. As I expected, Mr Bowman was uneasy in his mind this morning; quite early I heard him holding forth in a very distinct voice - purposely so, I thought - to the Bow Street officers in the bar, as to the loss that the town had sustained in their Rector, and as to the necessity of leaving no stone unturned (he was very great on this phrase) in order to come at the truth. I suspect him of being an orator of repute at convivial meetings. When I was at breakfast he came to wait on me, and took an opportunity when handing a muffin to say in a low tone, \"I 'ope, sir, you reconize as my feelings towards your relative is not actuated by any taint of what you may call melignity - you can leave the room, Eliza, I will see the gentleman 'as all he requires with my own hands - I ask your pardon, sir, but you must be well aware a man is not always master of himself: and when that man has been 'urt in his mind by the application of expressions which I will go so far as to say 'ad not ought to have been made use of (his voice was rising all this time and his face growing redder); no, sir; and 'ere, if you will permit of it, I should like to explain to you in a very few words the exact state of the bone of contention. This cask - I might more truly call it a firkin - of beer-\" I felt it was time to interpose, and said that I did not see that it would help us very much to go into that matter in detail. Mr Bowman acquiesced, and resumed more calmly: \"Well, sir, I bow to your ruling, and as you say, be that here or be it there, it don't contribute a great deal, perhaps, to the present question. All I wish you to understand is that I am as prepared as you are yourself to lend every hand to the business we have afore us, and - as I took the opportunity to say as much to the Orficers not three-quarters of an hour ago - to leave no stone unturned as may throw even a spark of light on this painful matter.\" In fact, Mr Bowman did accompany us on our exploration, but though I am sure his genuine wish was to be helpful, I am afraid he did not contribute to the serious side of it. He appeared to be under the impression that we were likely to meet either Uncle Henry or the person responsible for his disappearance, walking about the fields, and did a great deal of shading his eyes with his hand and calling our attention, by pointing with his stick, to distant cattle and labourers. He held several long conversations with old women whom we met, and was very strict and severe in his manner, but on each occasion returned to our party saying, \"Well, I find she don't seem to 'ave no connexion with this sad affair. I think you may take it from me, sir, as there's little or no light to be looked for from that quarter; not without she's keeping somethink back intentional.\" We gained no appreciable result, as I told you at starting; the Bow Street men have left the town, whether for London or not I am not sure. This evening I had company in the shape of a bagman, a smartish fellow. He knew what was going forward, but though he has been on the roads for some days about here, he had nothing to tell of suspicious characters - tramps, wandering sailors or gipsies. He was very full of a capital Punch and Judy Show he had seen this same day at W-, and asked if it had been here yet, and advised me by no means to miss it if it does come. The best Punch and the best Toby dog, he said, he had ever come across. Toby dogs, you know, are the last new thing in the shows. I have only seen one myself, but before long all the men will have them. Now why, you will want to know, do I trouble to write all this to you? I am obliged to do it, because it has something to do with another absurd trifle (as you will inevitably say), which in my present state of rather unquiet fancy - nothing more, perhaps - I have to put down. It is a dream, sir, which I am going to record, and I must say it is one of the oddest I have had. Is there anything in it beyond what the bagman's talk and Uncle Henry's disappearance could have suggested? You, I repeat, shall judge: I am not in a sufficiently cool and judicial frame to do so. It began with what I can only describe as a pulling-aside of curtains: and I found myself seated in a place - I don't know whether indoors or out. There were people - only a few - on either side of me, but I did not recognize them, or indeed think much about them. They never spoke, but, so far as I remember, were all grave and pale-faced and looked fixedly before them. Facing me there was a Punch and Judy Show, perhaps rather larger than the ordinary ones, painted with black figures on a reddish-yellow ground. Behind it and on each side was only darkness, but in front there was a sufficiency of light. I was \"strung up\" to a high degree of expectation and looked every moment to hear the pan-pipes and the Roo-too-too-it. Instead of that there came suddenly an enormous - I can use no other word - an enormous single toll of a bell, I don't know from how far off - somewhere behind. The little curtain flew up and the drama began. I believe someone once tried to re-write Punch as a serious tragedy; but whoever he may have been, this performance would have suited him exactly. There was something Satanic about the hero. He varied his methods of attack: for some of his victims he lay in wait, and to see his horrible face - it was yellowish-white, I may remark - peering round the wings made me think of the Vampyre in Fuseli's foul sketch. To others he was polite and carneying - particularly to the unfortunate alien who can only say Shallabalah - though what Punch said I never could catch. But with all of them I came to dread the moment of death. The crack of the stick on their skulls, which in the ordinary way delights me, had here a crushing sound as if the bone was giving way, and the victims quivered and kicked as they lay. The baby - it sounds more ridiculous as I go on - the baby, I am sure, was alive. Punch wrung its neck, and if the choke or squeak which it gave were not real, I know nothing of reality. The stage got perceptibly darker as each crime was consummated, and at last there was one murder which was done quite in the dark, so that I could see nothing of the victim, and took some time to effect. It was accompanied by hard breathing and horrid muffled sounds, and after it Punch came and sat on the foot-board and fanned himself and looked at his shoes, which were bloody, and hung his head on one side, and sniggered in so deadly a fashion that I saw some of those beside me cover their faces, and I would gladly have done the same. But in the meantime the scene behind Punch was clearing, and showed, not the usual house front, but something more ambitious - a grove of trees and the gentle slope of a hill, with a very natural - in fact, I should say a real - moon shining on it. Over this there rose slowly an object which I soon perceived to be a human figure with something peculiar about the head - what, I was unable at first to see. It did not stand on its feet, but began creeping or dragging itself across the middle distance towards Punch, who still sat back to it; and by this time, I may remark (though it did not occur to me at the moment) that all pretence of this being a puppet show had vanished. Punch was still Punch, it is true, but, like the others, was in some sense a live creature, and both moved themselves at their own will. When I next glanced at him he was sitting in malignant reflection; but in another instant something seemed to attract his attention, and he first sat up sharply and then turned round, and evidently caught sight of the person that was approaching him and was in fact now very near. Then, indeed, did he show unmistakable signs of terror: catching up his stick, he rushed towards the wood, only just eluding the arm of his pursuer, which was suddenly flung out to intercept him. It was with a revulsion which I cannot easily express that I now saw more or less clearly what this pursuer was like. He was a sturdy figure clad in black, and, as I thought, wearing bands: his head was covered with a whitish bag. The chase which now began lasted I do not know how long, now among the trees, now along the slope of the field, sometimes both figures disappearing wholly for a few seconds, and only some uncertain sounds letting one know that they were still afoot. At length there came a moment when Punch, evidently exhausted, staggered in from the left and threw himself down among the trees. His pursuer was not long after him, and came looking uncertainly from side to side. Then, catching sight of the figure on the ground, he too threw himself down - his back was turned to the audience - with a swift motion twitched the covering from his head, and thrust his face into that of Punch. Everything on the instant grew dark. There was one long, loud, shuddering scream, and I awoke to find myself looking straight into the face of - what in all the world do you think? but - a large owl, which was seated on my window-sill immediately opposite my bed-foot, holding up its wings like two shrouded arms. I caught the fierce glance of its yellow eyes, and then it was gone. I heard the single enormous bell again - very likely, as you are saying to yourself, the church clock; but I do not think so - and then I was broad awake. All this, I may say, happened within the last half-hour. There was no probability of my getting to sleep again, so I got up, put on clothes enough to keep me warm, and am writing this rigmarole in the first hours of Christmas Day. Have I left out anything? Yes; there was no Toby dog, and the names over the front of the Punch and Judy booth were Kidman and Gallop, which were certainly not what the bagman told me to look out for. By this time, I feel a little more as if I could sleep, so this shall be sealed and wafered. Letter IV Dec. 26, '37. My Dear Robert, All is over. The body has been found. I do not make excuses for not having sent off my news by last night's mail, for the simple reason that I was incapable of putting pen to paper. The events that attended the discovery bewildered me so completely that I needed what I could get of a night's rest to enable me to face the situation at all. Now I can give you my journal of the day, certainly the strangest Christmas Day that ever I spent or am likely to spend. The first incident was not very serious. Mr Bowman had, I think, been keeping Christmas Eve, and was a little inclined to be captious: at least, he was not on foot very early, and to judge from what I could hear, neither men nor maids could do anything to please him. The latter were certainly reduced to tears; nor am I sure that Mr Bowman succeeded in preserving a manly composure. At any rate, when I came downstairs, it was in a broken voice that he wished me the compliments of the season, and a little later on when he paid his visit of ceremony at breakfast, he was far from cheerful, even Byronic, I might almost say, in his outlook on life. \"I don't know,\" he said, \"if you think with me, sir; but every Christmas as comes round the world seems a hollerer thing to me. Why, take an example now from what lays under my own eye. There's my servant Eliza - been with me now for going on 15 years. I thought I could have placed my confidence in Eliza, and yet this very morning - Christmas morning too, of all the blessed days in the year - with the bells a-ringing and - and - all like that - I say, this very morning, had it not have been for Providence watching over us all, that girl would have put - indeed I may go so far to say, 'ad put the cheese on your breakfast-table-\" He saw I was about to speak, and waved his hand at me. \"It's all very well for you to say, 'Yes, Mr Bowman, but you took away the cheese and locked it up in the cupboard,' which I did, and have the key here, or if not the actual key, one very much about the same size. That's true enough, sir, but what do you think is the effect of that action on me? Why, it's no exaggeration for me to say that the ground is cut from under my feet. And yet when I said as much to Eliza, not nasty, mind you, but just firm-like, what was my return? 'Oh,' she says, 'well,' she says, 'there wasn't no bones broke, I suppose.' Well, sir, it 'urt me, that's all I can say: it 'urt me, and I don't like to think of it now.\" There was an ominous pause here, in which I ventured to say something like, \"Yes, very trying,\" and then asked at what hour the church service was to be. \"Eleven o'clock,\" Mr Bowman said with a heavy sigh. \"Ah, you won't have no such discourse from poor Mr Lucas as what you would have done from our late Rector. Him and me may have had our little differences, and did do, more's the pity.\" I could see that a powerful effort was needed to keep him off the vexed question of the cask of beer, but he made it. \"But I will say this, that a better preacher, nor yet one to stand faster by his rights or what he considered to be his rights - however, that's not the question now - I for one, never set under. Some might say, 'Was he a eloquent man?' and to that my answer would be: 'Well, there you've a better right per'aps to speak of your own uncle than what I have.' Others might ask, 'Did he keep a hold of his congregation?' and there again I should reply, 'That depends.' But as I say - yes, Eliza, my girl, I'm coming - eleven o'clock, sir, and you inquire for the King's Head pew.\" I believe Eliza had been very near the door, and shall consider it in my vail. The next episode was church: I felt Mr Lucas had a difficult task in doing justice to Christmas sentiments, and also to the feeling of disquiet and regret which, whatever Mr Bowman might say, was clearly prevalent. I do not think he rose to the occasion. I was uncomfortable. The organ wolved - you know what I mean: the wind died - twice in the Christmas Hymn, and the tenor bell, I suppose owing to some negligence on the part of the ringers, kept sounding faintly about once in a minute during the sermon. The clerk sent up a man to see to it, but he seemed unable to do much. I was glad when it was over. There was an odd incident, too, before the service. I went in rather early, and came upon two men carrying the parish bier back to its place under the tower. From what I overheard them saying, it appeared that it had been put out by mistake, by someone who was not there. I also saw the clerk busy folding up a moth-eaten velvet pall - not a sight for Christmas Day. I dined soon after this, and then, feeling disinclined to go out, took my seat by the fire in the parlour, with the last number of Pickwick, which I had been saving up for some days. I thought I could be sure of keeping awake over this, but I turned out as bad as our friend Smith. I suppose it was half-past two when I was roused by a piercing whistle and laughing and talking voices outside in the market-place. It was a Punch and Judy - I had no doubt the one that my bagman had seen at W-. I was half delighted, half not - the latter because my unpleasant dream came back to me so vividly; but, anyhow, I determined to see it through, and I sent Eliza out with a crown-piece to the performers and a request that they would face my window if they could manage it. The show was a very smart new one; the names of the proprietors, I need hardly tell you, were Italian, Foresta and Calpigi. The Toby dog was there, as I had been led to expect. All B- turned out, but did not obstruct my view, for I was at the large first-floor window and not 10 yards away. The play began on the stroke of a quarter to three by the church clock. Certainly it was very good; and I was soon relieved to find that the disgust my dream had given me for Punch's onslaughts on his ill-starred visitors was only transient. I laughed at the demise of the Turncock, the Foreigner, the Beadle, and even the baby. The only drawback was the Toby dog's developing a tendency to howl in the wrong place. Something had occurred, I suppose, to upset him, and something considerable: for, I forget exactly at what point, he gave a most lamentable cry, leapt off the foot-board, and shot away across the market-place and down a side street. There was a stage-wait, but only a brief one. I suppose the men decided that it was no good going after him, and that he was likely to turn up again at night. We went on. Punch dealt faithfully with Judy, and in fact with all comers; and then came the moment when the gallows was erected, and the great scene with Mr Ketch was to be enacted. It was now that something happened of which I can certainly not yet see the import fully. You have witnessed an execution, and know what the criminal's head looks like with the cap on. If you are like me, you never wish to think of it again, and I do not willingly remind you of it. It was just such a head as that, that I, from my somewhat higher post, saw in the inside of the show-box; but at first the audience did not see it. I expected it to emerge into their view, but instead of that there slowly rose for a few seconds an uncovered face, with an expression of terror upon it, of which I have never imagined the like. It seemed as if the man, whoever he was, was being forcibly lifted, with his arms somehow pinioned or held back, towards the little gibbet on the stage. I could just see the nightcapped head behind him. Then there was a cry and a crash. The whole show-box fell over backwards; kicking legs were seen among the ruins, and then two figures - as some said; I can only answer for one - were visible running at top speed across the square and disappearing in a lane which leads to the fields. Of course everybody gave chase. I followed; but the pace was killing, and very few were in, literally, at the death. It happened in a chalk pit: the man went over the edge quite blindly and broke his neck. They searched everywhere for the other, until it occurred to me to ask whether he had ever left the market-place. At first everyone was sure that he had; but when we came to look, he was there, under the show-box, dead too. But in the chalk pit it was that poor Uncle Henry's body was found, with a sack over the head, the throat horribly mangled. It was a peaked corner of the sack sticking out of the soil that attracted attention. I cannot bring myself to write in greater detail. I forgot to say the men's real names were Kidman and Gallop. I feel sure I have heard them, but no one here seems to know anything about them. I am coming to you as soon as I can after the funeral. I must tell you when we meet what I think of it all. \u0095 The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance is from The Haunted Dolls' House and Other Stories by MR James, published by Penguin Books, price \u00a36.99. www.penguin.co.uk",

Common sense sometimes seems to suggest one is in error, but this is not the time to think about that, in the few hours for reflection we have in the days when the party's over, before the January hangover begins. These are the best days in the year, and thank God for it, we of his humbler creation, with our occasionally not so feeble praise. #149; This is an edited extract from Fay Weldon's meditation on Christmas, to be broadcast on Radio 4 on at 12.15am on December 26.",

Ashley Fitton, of Bury, Greater Manchester, spent a night in the cells after being arrested, but walked free from court when her solicitor stumbled on a forgotten section of a 75-year-old law. The court heard that Mrs Fitton, 38, had gone for a meal with her husband, Barrie, and 15-year-old daughter at a restaurant in Manchester. When they left and were unable to find a taxi, Mr Fitton took his wife's arm and made her get into the driving seat of his Jaguar, although she was three times over the drink limit. Mrs Fitton's solicitor Nicholas Freeman said yesterday: \"I was looking at the law and case history on duress of circumstance when I saw an oblique reference to coercion. \"This took me to section 47 of the 1925 Criminal Justice Act. This suggested that Mrs Fitton could not be guilty if she had been forced to drive by her husband as a result of a threat of violence, violence, or moral obligation.\" The only exceptions were in cases of murder or treason, the court was told. Proof beyond reasonable doubt was not required; instead the magistrates had to decide whether, on the balance of probabilities, coercion had taken place. \"They were very sympathetic,\" added Mr Freeman. He said the law was based on the concept from a bygone era that a wife was her husband's chattel. \"I don't think this section will be repealed, but it may have to be amended to include relationships other than husbands and wives.\" After the hearing, Mrs Fitton described the incident as \"terrifying and horrific\". \"My husband saw some people he didn't want to be associated with and decided we had to get away. But we couldn't get a taxi and he started panicking. \"He told me to get behind the wheel of his Jaguar, but I kept refusing because I knew I shouldn't be driving. \"He got more and more worked up so when he pushed me towards the car, I got in. \"I felt I was driving carefully but the police pulled me up almost immediately.\" Mrs Fitton was found not guilty of driving with excess alcohol and was awarded costs.",

Officers would not confirm reports that they think they know who stabbed Damilola. Sky News said police just needed more witnesses to come forward before confirming the killers' identity. Blow to Irving The disgraced author David Irving was yesterday refused leave to appeal against his defeat in the libel action he brought against Penguin Books and the author Deborah Lipstadt. Irving was found to have falsified history to exonerate Hitler, driven by his pro-Nazi views. Speed trap Road safety campaigners condemned traffic police who took no action against the driver of an official car carrying a chief constable which was caught speeding. Surrey Chief Constable Denis O'Connor apologised after his car was caught travelling at 78mph in a 50mph zone near Guildford. Baby death A six-week-old baby who died may have been suffocated by the family cat as he slept in his cot. The unnamed child's mother went to feed her son at 5am yesterday at their home in King-steignton, Devon and found the cat curled up next to the baby's body. Prices driven up Motorway service stations do not offer hungry motorists value for money but are not behaving anti-competitively, an inquiry ruled. The office of fair trading said there was no evidence to suggest collusion between rival operators or excess profits.

      "byline": "Paul Rogers",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Prince Charles's excursion into the Euro-force controversy adds to the scepticism now being expressed in Washington, in contrast to the cautious welcome originally given it by the Clinton administration. In ordinary circumstances, this would be a minor spat, but the Bush victory does suggest a very different American approach to international security. In this respect, the election could turn out to be the most significant result since the Carter/Reagan clash 20 years ago that gave us the renewed cold war of the early 80s.</p> <p>This time, though, there is no single ideological enemy but a volatile world of many threats and few certainties. To face this, Bush has gathered round him many of the hawks of the late 80s and it is clear that, under his presidency, American security policy will seek to maintain military as well as economic supremacy, building on and expanding the \"global reach\" developed in recent years. The US will encourage Europe to share the burden, especially in its own back yard, as long as it does not get too big for its boots. Any attempt to develop independent forces will be opposed vigorously, hence the concern over the Euro-force.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the emphasis in the US military is on long-range air power and rapid deployment forces, with a renewed emphasis on counter-insurgency training - US forces currently operate in over 50 countries. A Bush administration will extend this much further, with funding for missile defence as well as new nuclear weapons developments, and, before too long, the development of space-based lasers and other exotica for controlling an unruly world.</p> <p>But is it all self-defeating? Could the US preoccupation with protecting its own interests actually be increasing in security for all, including itself? Instead of succeeding in maintaining the status quo for a relatively small and largely western-based elite, perhaps it is actually in the process of losing control.</p> <p>One thing is clear, and that is that two basic \"drivers\" of global security are coming to the fore. One is the rapidly widening wealth-poverty divide, with a transglobal elite of barely a billion people surging ahead of the rest and already taking more than 80% of world wealth. Free market globalisation may be delivering patchy economic growth, but it is singularly failing to deliver economic justice and a global economic apartheid is taking root. Yet improved literacy and communications are ensuring that far more people are aware of their own marginalisation, creating all the conditions for a progressive revolution of unfulfilled expectations.</p> <p>This mass marginalisation is increasing the chances of anti-elite action, with the Zapatistas in Mexico and insurgencies in Peru, Colombia, Nepal, Indonesia, north Africa and the Middle East among the many early examples of a revolt from the margins. It is hardly surprising that counter-insurgency and elite support has become such a major activity, especially for the United States.</p> <p>Beyond this, though, lies the evident prospect of increasing global environmental limits to economic development. The early signs were apparent, with the 1991 Gulf war serving as the first major resource war of the post-cold war era, and ozone depletion the first indicator of a human impact on the global environment.

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles's excursion into the Euro-force controversy adds to the scepticism now being expressed in Washington, in contrast to the cautious welcome originally given it by the Clinton administration. In ordinary circumstances, this would be a minor spat, but the Bush victory does suggest a very different American approach to international security. In this respect, the election could turn out to be the most significant result since the Carter/Reagan clash 20 years ago that gave us the renewed cold war of the early 80s. This time, though, there is no single ideological enemy but a volatile world of many threats and few certainties. To face this, Bush has gathered round him many of the hawks of the late 80s and it is clear that, under his presidency, American security policy will seek to maintain military as well as economic supremacy, building on and expanding the \"global reach\" developed in recent years. The US will encourage Europe to share the burden, especially in its own back yard, as long as it does not get too big for its boots. Any attempt to develop independent forces will be opposed vigorously, hence the concern over the Euro-force. Meanwhile, the emphasis in the US military is on long-range air power and rapid deployment forces, with a renewed emphasis on counter-insurgency training - US forces currently operate in over 50 countries. A Bush administration will extend this much further, with funding for missile defence as well as new nuclear weapons developments, and, before too long, the development of space-based lasers and other exotica for controlling an unruly world. But is it all self-defeating? Could the US preoccupation with protecting its own interests actually be increasing in security for all, including itself? Instead of succeeding in maintaining the status quo for a relatively small and largely western-based elite, perhaps it is actually in the process of losing control. One thing is clear, and that is that two basic \"drivers\" of global security are coming to the fore. One is the rapidly widening wealth-poverty divide, with a transglobal elite of barely a billion people surging ahead of the rest and already taking more than 80% of world wealth. Free market globalisation may be delivering patchy economic growth, but it is singularly failing to deliver economic justice and a global economic apartheid is taking root. Yet improved literacy and communications are ensuring that far more people are aware of their own marginalisation, creating all the conditions for a progressive revolution of unfulfilled expectations. This mass marginalisation is increasing the chances of anti-elite action, with the Zapatistas in Mexico and insurgencies in Peru, Colombia, Nepal, Indonesia, north Africa and the Middle East among the many early examples of a revolt from the margins. It is hardly surprising that counter-insurgency and elite support has become such a major activity, especially for the United States. Beyond this, though, lies the evident prospect of increasing global environmental limits to economic development. The early signs were apparent, with the 1991 Gulf war serving as the first major resource war of the post-cold war era, and ozone depletion the first indicator of a human impact on the global environment. Resource conflict may increase, but far more significant is the likely impact of climate change. As a progressive \"drying-out\" of the tropics develops, the impact on food supplies will be formidable, with a further impact on marginalisation, and a surge in migration borne of desperation. Above all this is a global elite, centred on the west, and determined to keep the lid on instability. \"Liddism\", though, is hardly a sound policy, even from a security perspective, let alone the raw injustice of seeking to maintain a deeply unfair status quo. From within the current security paradigm, three problems are already perceived, even by some people in the military and strategic studies communities who are growing doubtful that stability can be maintained. For a start, techniques of asymmetric warfare are allowing the weak to confront the strong.

      "bodyText": "Scientists studying a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy believe they have found the earliest evidence of a working artificial body part. They say the mummified remains of a woman discovered in the necropolis of Thebes-West show that her big toe was surgically removed and replaced with a wooden one which allowed her to move about normally. Although papyrus writings suggest that the ancient Egyptians had surgical skills, there was no evidence until now that they were able to amputate limbs from living patients and replace them with prostheses. The scientists, from Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, say that the woman's toe had clearly been removed during her lifetime, because the amputation site was covered with an intact layer of soft tissue, including skin. The amputation was probably carried out because the woman, who died in her 50s, had developed gangrene as a result of arteriosclerosis- the hardening of the arteries. After the operation, the woman was given a wooden toe, painted brown and delicately shaped to resemble a real big toe, including the nail. The artificial toe was attached to two small wooden plates with leather strings and the whole device was then tied around the foot, keeping it firmly in place. Writing in The Lancet, the team, headed by Professor Andreas Nerlich, says: \"This construction provided sufficient stability to keep the prosthesis in the correct position, and allow the user to move without major restrictions. \"Careful inspection revealed clear marks of use on the sole of the prosthetic toe. \"The big toe usually bears about 40% of walking weight and its replacement is, therefore, of certain importance.

The crisis began on Tuesday when about 5,000 soldiers stormed 20 prisons to end a two-month hunger strike by leftwing inmates protesting at government plans to move them from dormitory-style wards to new cell-type prisons. Prisoners at Istanbul's Umraniye prison, the last to hold out, began surrendering yesterday after Turkish soldiers cut holes in the roof and lobbed inside so many tear gas grenades that at least 19 ambulances had to evacuate soldiers and prisoners. Reports said that four inmates were killed and at least 50 injured during the Umraniye clashes, while the bodies of three other inmates were discovered and another died in hospital, raising the death toll from four days of clashes to 26 prisoners and two soldiers. Ozgur Tayad, a prisoners' support group, said the death toll was much higher but gave no figures. Most of the inmates set themselves ablaze and burned to death rather than surrender. At least five of the bodies had gunshot wounds, a post-mortem report revealed. Turkish prisons are overcrowded and prisoners often live in wards that house up to 100 people. Leftwing, Kurdish and Islamic groups often run their wards like political indoctrination centres, complete with wall murals of political figures and flags.

      "trailText": "<p>Interview: Dianne Thompson, chief executive, Camelot</p>",
      "byline": "David Teather",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Dianne Thompson, the chief executive of Camelot, listened to the messages on her mobile phone on Tuesday night she was surprised to find one from Sir Richard Branson. </p> <p>The call was to congratulate her for winning the next seven-year licence to run the National Lottery, at the expense of his own, long held ambition. Sir Richard had apparently gone to great lengths to get the number of his nemesis, eventually finding a deeply suspicious journalist who grudgingly handed it over. </p> <p>The message was not, said Sir Richard, an admission of defeat - there is still the threat of further legal action - but to commend Thompson's fighting spirit. She had, he said, saved Camelot after it had been ruled out of the contest by the National Lottery commission in August. </p> <p>\"He was obviously absolutely gutted,\" she says. \"You could see that on his TV interview, and I know how he feels because I was gutted in the summer when we had been ruled out. For whatever reason he wanted the lottery very badly, but he was very gracious toward Camelot and particularly gracious toward me.\" </p> <p>Thompson, 49, recently described herself as \"a woman with balls. Balls of steel\", a quote likely to haunt her for the rest of her career. But few, particularly Sir Richard, would disagree. </p> <p>It was chiefly Thompson's tenacity that pulled the lottery operator back from the brink of almost certain defeat and through the courts to a second term. </p> <p>Thompson discovered Camelot had won when a fax machine in the Watford head office whirred into life at around a minute past four on Tuesday afternoon. </p> <p>The chief executive designate was in the company's small London quarters just off Trafalgar Square, where she had decamped in readiness for the onslaught of media interviews. She had a video link to Watford where Tim Holley tore the message off to give her the news - and in doing so handed over his job. </p> <p>\"He said, 'I'm just going to read this and please keep your voices down.' When he read it we were just like, 'yes!'\" she recalls in hushed tones with a punch in the air. She then had a \"little cry\" and informed the rest of the staff. Thompson was prepared for either outcome and admits she was not confident of winning. </p> <p>Press notices and Q&amp;A crib sheets were ready for both winning or losing. She had even made \"win or lose\" recordings for staff hotlines. There was no need to fake depression for the 'we've lost' message. She had a lump in her throat as she made the recording. </p> <p><strong> Fat cat grotesque</strong><br> </p> <p> After the result, four hours of press interviews followed and then Yates Wine Lodge in Watford to join staff for a drink. The next day at Camelot's office, she confesses to being \"knackered\" and nibbles at biscuits, having not eaten for 36 hours. At one point she drops the comment, \"whoever wins the licence\" before pulling herself up. \"Hang on, we've won the licence, hurrah. It hasn't quite sunk in yet.\" </p> <p>The contrast between the impromptu celebrations and Sir Richard's champagne, marquee and sleigh at his Holland Park home is stark, and one of which Thompson and Camelot are fully aware. </p> <p>Thompson's image could hardly be further removed from the fat cat grotesque which had come to characterise Camelot during its first six years. A clearly popular figure among staff, she is a working class single mother who stands just 5ft tall. She has a ready laugh and little of the posturing associated with many successful businesspeople. </p> <p>\"Very sadly, the image of Camelot has been one of fat cats, which I think was typified by a picture of [chairman] Sir George Russell, [former communications director] David Rigg and Tim walking into the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Tim's a great bloke and has been unjustly maligned but I think I am quite the opposite of him. I'm female, I'm northern, I've still got a northern accent, I am from a working class background - a butcher's daughter, as everyone now knows - and I think that probably has helped.\" </p> <p>Thompson now has to get used to her celebrity. She has also had to get used to the world knowing her salary - \u00a3330,000 and a third lower than Holley to address public concerns over levels of pay. \"It is horrid. I'm used to it now, but the first time it was in the paper it was awful. My dad lives in Yorkshire, where for \u00a380,000 you can buy a very decent house. So people up there were a bit shocked.\" Thompson now lives in Buckinghamshire, where \u00a380,000 does not go quite so far. </p> <p>The salaries were cut in response to public concern, bonuses have also been abolished and the share dividend halved. </p> <p>Thompson is mindful of the public rancour toward Camelot but feels much of the criticism has been unjustified. \"I was sitting next to a headhunter at dinner the other night and asked if I could be called a fat cat on my salary. He said, 'I could probably double it for you now given the size of the business'.\" </p> <p>Camelot will be arguing for a change in the process for awarding the next licence after the often farcical events of the past year. Thompson believes the people who decide on the licence award should not be those who act as watchdogs. She is also critical of using part-timers who are paid just \u00a36,000 a year. </p> <p>Thompson also disagrees with Sir Richard's assessment that Camelot has in effect been awarded the licence in perpetuity, given the risk averse tendency shown by the commission. Part of the review for the process of awarding the licence could see a radical shake-up. In other countries, for instance, the operator changes but simply takes over the terminals, staff and buildings of the previous licence holder, removing any substantive advantage for the incumbent operator. </p> <p>Use of the internet, interactive TV and mobile phones to sell tickets may also bring in new companies wanting to bid, Thompson says. \"This time was really a mirror image of the first bidding [in 1994]. I think we can certainly expect more competition next time.\" </p> <p>She says she has no difficulty in understanding the change of heart among the commissioners which has so upset Sir Richard, because, in her opinion, their original assessment was so flawed. Without saying it flatly, Thompson is deeply critical of Dame Helena Shovelton. </p> <p>\"The commissioners had taken a fairly simplistic view. They argued the People's Lottery would offer more to good causes at equivalent sales levels, but you can't only look at equivalent sales. Lord Burns, with his background in econometrics, is more used to financial forescasting.\" </p> <p><strong> 'Big jackpots drive sales'</strong><br> </p> <p> Camelot has pledged to invest \u00a31bn and raise \u00a315bn for good causes over the life of the next licence. New games could include a draw across Europe with vast prize funds modelled on Powerball, a game in the US where jackpots can reach $200m. The People's Lottery might have believed that better odds and smaller prizes were the way forward, but empirical evidence suggests otherwise. \"Big jackpots are what drive sales.\" </p> <p>Thompson was born in Batley, where her father worked for the Co-op and her mother as a fitter in Clarks' shoes. She has had what she describes as an \"eclectic\" career which included running her own advertising agency, polytechnic lecturer, managing director of a Swedish hand tools company and marketing director of Woolworths. Her toughest job was as marketing director of Signet, the former Ratners, which she was asked to turn around after Gerald Ratner's infamous \"crap\" comment. </p> <p>She says the experiences of the past year, however, have been all-consuming. </p> <p>\"I've done nothing but eat, breathe and sleep Camelot since the process began in September last year, and big things that a parent should do I've just not been able to do.\" Her daughter's GSCE results came out on the day after Camelot was told it had been excluded in August. </p> <p>But she can't relax just yet. Sir Richard, who flew to join his family on holiday in the Caribbean on Wednesday morning, will be considering over Christmas whether to launch legal action. </p> <p>Thompson suggests he \"hasn't thought through the implication\" of further delays which are putting the timetable for installing new terminals for the next licence in jeopardy. If he does decide to launch an appeal, no doubt he will be encouraged by Thompson's performance in the summer, when Camelot had all but been given up for dead.</p>",

A clearly popular figure among staff, she is a working class single mother who stands just 5ft tall. She has a ready laugh and little of the posturing associated with many successful businesspeople. \"Very sadly, the image of Camelot has been one of fat cats, which I think was typified by a picture of [chairman] Sir George Russell, [former communications director] David Rigg and Tim walking into the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Tim's a great bloke and has been unjustly maligned but I think I am quite the opposite of him. I'm female, I'm northern, I've still got a northern accent, I am from a working class background - a butcher's daughter, as everyone now knows - and I think that probably has helped.\" Thompson now has to get used to her celebrity. She has also had to get used to the world knowing her salary - \u00a3330,000 and a third lower than Holley to address public concerns over levels of pay. \"It is horrid. I'm used to it now, but the first time it was in the paper it was awful. My dad lives in Yorkshire, where for \u00a380,000 you can buy a very decent house. So people up there were a bit shocked.\" Thompson now lives in Buckinghamshire, where \u00a380,000 does not go quite so far. The salaries were cut in response to public concern, bonuses have also been abolished and the share dividend halved. Thompson is mindful of the public rancour toward Camelot but feels much of the criticism has been unjustified. \"I was sitting next to a headhunter at dinner the other night and asked if I could be called a fat cat on my salary. He said, 'I could probably double it for you now given the size of the business'.\" Camelot will be arguing for a change in the process for awarding the next licence after the often farcical events of the past year. Thompson believes the people who decide on the licence award should not be those who act as watchdogs. She is also critical of using part-timers who are paid just \u00a36,000 a year. Thompson also disagrees with Sir Richard's assessment that Camelot has in effect been awarded the licence in perpetuity, given the risk averse tendency shown by the commission. Part of the review for the process of awarding the licence could see a radical shake-up. In other countries, for instance, the operator changes but simply takes over the terminals, staff and buildings of the previous licence holder, removing any substantive advantage for the incumbent operator. Use of the internet, interactive TV and mobile phones to sell tickets may also bring in new companies wanting to bid, Thompson says. \"This time was really a mirror image of the first bidding [in 1994]. I think we can certainly expect more competition next time.\" She says she has no difficulty in understanding the change of heart among the commissioners which has so upset Sir Richard, because, in her opinion, their original assessment was so flawed. Without saying it flatly, Thompson is deeply critical of Dame Helena Shovelton. \"The commissioners had taken a fairly simplistic view. They argued the People's Lottery would offer more to good causes at equivalent sales levels, but you can't only look at equivalent sales. Lord Burns, with his background in econometrics, is more used to financial forescasting.\" 'Big jackpots drive sales' Camelot has pledged to invest \u00a31bn and raise \u00a315bn for good causes over the life of the next licence. New games could include a draw across Europe with vast prize funds modelled on Powerball, a game in the US where jackpots can reach $200m. The People's Lottery might have believed that better odds and smaller prizes were the way forward, but empirical evidence suggests otherwise. \"Big jackpots are what drive sales.\" Thompson was born in Batley, where her father worked for the Co-op and her mother as a fitter in Clarks' shoes. She has had what she describes as an \"eclectic\" career which included running her own advertising agency, polytechnic lecturer, managing director of a Swedish hand tools company and marketing director of Woolworths. Her toughest job was as marketing director of Signet, the former Ratners, which she was asked to turn around after Gerald Ratner's infamous \"crap\" comment. She says the experiences of the past year, however, have been all-consuming. \"I've done nothing but eat, breathe and sleep Camelot since the process began in September last year, and big things that a parent should do I've just not been able to do.\" Her daughter's GSCE results came out on the day after Camelot was told it had been excluded in August. But she can't relax just yet. Sir Richard, who flew to join his family on holiday in the Caribbean on Wednesday morning, will be considering over Christmas whether to launch legal action. Thompson suggests he \"hasn't thought through the implication\" of further delays which are putting the timetable for installing new terminals for the next licence in jeopardy. If he does decide to launch an appeal, no doubt he will be encouraged by Thompson's performance in the summer, when Camelot had all but been given up for dead.",

The only company carrying out extensive marketing, she claimed, was British Gas. </p> <p>Several industry executives have publicly criticised Centrica's continuing dominance of the market more than three years after liberalisation - it retains more than 70% of gas customers and has won 15% of electricity customers. Dr Cable said it would be premature to lift its price controls. </p> <p>An Ofgem consultation on price controls ends on January 10, with an official verdict likely before the end of February. British Gas has warned that it could face a \u00a3220m hit over the 15 months from October to the end of 2001 if it does not raise prices but it enjoys a greater cushion because of its Morecambe Bay reserves and long-term contracts.</p>",

The energy regulator, Ofgem, is worried that North Sea gas is coming back to Britain through the inter-connector with the continent - but at higher prices than those indicated in mainland Europe. The DTI minister told BBC Radio 4: \"If there's any question whatsoever of collusion among the companies, we have in the OFT very, very strong powers to take these matters into investigation and that's what they will do if these reports [on British Gas] are true. \"There is supposed to be good, open competition out there and prices are supposed to come down, not go up. \"The British public can't as easily be fooled as it was in previous years by these price rises. People are just going to say: if oil prices are coming down, why are gas prices going up.\" Ann Robinson, chairman of Energy Watch, the official consumer body, said a lot of independent, smaller suppliers were struggling hard to contain costs and losing money to the extent that they had ceased taking on new customers. The only company carrying out extensive marketing, she claimed, was British Gas. Several industry executives have publicly criticised Centrica's continuing dominance of the market more than three years after liberalisation - it retains more than 70% of gas customers and has won 15% of electricity customers. Dr Cable said it would be premature to lift its price controls. An Ofgem consultation on price controls ends on January 10, with an official verdict likely before the end of February. British Gas has warned that it could face a \u00a3220m hit over the 15 months from October to the end of 2001 if it does not raise prices but it enjoys a greater cushion because of its Morecambe Bay reserves and long-term contracts.",

      "bodyText": "Building materials group Hanson is for the second time this year to resume its regular membership of the FTSE 100 following the merger of drug companies Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Hanson will return to the top table based on a market capitalisation of \u00a33.3bn. The promotion will officially take place when the merged GlaxoSmithKline starts trading on Wednesday. A spokesman for Hanson said the news would not affect the company. \"It does not concern us,\" he said. \"It is something for the City to decide.\" But the market greeted the announcement with more enthusiasm, pushing Hanson's share price up 4.5% at 470p. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 in dex fell to a seven month low, down 18 points at 6,097.5. Hanson held a regular spot in the FTSE 100 index until it dropped out after the group demerged in 1997. It has continued to dip in and out ever since - this year falling out in March before being reinstated in June for a three month spell. The company has had a year of mixed fortunes: battling against rising fuel costs, heavy rainfall and a slowing down in demand in the US. Last month, it warned that this year's oil price was likely to add \u00a340m to its costs and help push pretax profits before exceptionals below the 1999 figure of \u00a3314.3m. Floods also affected demand, nearly halting activity at a number of construction sites, the company said. In a separate development, Hanson yesterday said it was to sell its waste management division to Waste Recycling Group for \u00a3185m in cash. Hanson chief executive Andrew Dougal said in a statement: \"The sale represents a further step in focusing Hanson as a leading heavy building materials company.\" Former members of the FTSE 100 losing out to Hanson yesterday included Scottish and Newcastle and Enterprise Oil. Others still waiting to make their debut include health care group Smith &amp; Nephew, discount clothing chain Matalan, and supermarkets firm Morrison. Hanson's place on the FTSE 250 index will be taken by house builder Beazer, which is to merge with another house-building firm, Bryant.",

But the OFT decided that motorists were not being ripped off when they stopped for food or fuel. John Vickers, the director general of fair trading, said that there was no case for ordering a competition commission investigation. \"Consumers are justifiably concerned that motorway service areas offer poor value for money,\" he said. \"But we have not found evidence that operators are earning excessive profits or deliberately restricting competition.\" The OFT report was welcomed by the service station operators who had argued that their high prices were a result of their unique infrastructure costs.

      "bodyText": "Three American youths were sentenced to long jail terms yesterday for killing two women in what the judge described as a game of Russian roulette with other people's lives. The victims, aged 20 and 41, were killed in February when the defendants dropped rocks, some the size of footballs, from a bridge above a motorway, smashing through their windscreens and sending their cars spinning out of control. Five other people were injured in the resulting pile-up. The youths - one aged 15 and the others 18 - were sentenced to between seven and eight-and-a-half years in jail for the double murder, which took place near a US military community outside Darmstadt, in western Germany. They showed no reaction as the sentences were read out. They had admitted throwing the rocks from a pedestrian overpass on to a stretch of motorway near Lincoln Village, a US army settlement where about 600 families live. They said they took the rocks from a nearby building site and threw them over the two-metre high guard rail as they saw the cars below approaching. Prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 10 years. The court heard that the teenagers had started with small stones which they pitched over the side using a shovel, but then moved on to rocks as heavy as 8kg (18lb). Prosecutors argued that their persistence in throwing progressively larger objects was a key factor justifying the state's call for the maximum penalty to be imposed. But the youths' lawyers maintained their clients were not trying to kill anyone. \"They wanted to hit vehicles,\" defence counsel Ulrich Endres told reporters after the closing arguments.

No way.\" One of the Liverpool 500 has asked us to clarify that while they sang the Glory, Glory tune, Man United's words were not those sung: \"None of the 500 would have done so for \u00a3300, never mind the \u00a330 on offer!\" \u0095 A food item on page 28 of the December 16 edition of the Guide stated that chef Gary Rhodes had no restaurant in Edinburgh. In fact, the book cited in the Guide item - Edinburgh on a Plate - lists such a restaurant, Rhodes &amp; Co on Rose Street in the Scots (not Scot's, as we said) capital. The readers' editor is away until January 3. The Guardian's corrections and clarifications column will return on January 4.

      "body": "<p>Sir Hubert Bennett, who has died aged 91, took over the London county council's architect's department in 1956. It was then at the height of its prestige, with a staff of 3,000 and a boundless prospect for rebuilding the capital. By the time he left in 1970, the optimism had faded.</p> <p>The LCC had given way to the Greater London council, a change which deprived Bennett of his planning powers. Many of his best architects had been tempted away to private firms and Thamesmead, the flagship project of the Bennett years, was mired in the intractability of the Erith marshes.</p> <p>Bennett was a vigorous and debonair figurehead, and many of the LCC's best projects were completed under his leadership. But his reputation has been tarnished by the fact that the currents of architectural power and fashion alike ran against him throughout his period at County Hall.</p> <p>His ascent to what looked like the most enviable post in public sector architecture had been a surprise to many.

      "bodyText": "Sir Hubert Bennett, who has died aged 91, took over the London county council's architect's department in 1956. It was then at the height of its prestige, with a staff of 3,000 and a boundless prospect for rebuilding the capital. By the time he left in 1970, the optimism had faded. The LCC had given way to the Greater London council, a change which deprived Bennett of his planning powers. Many of his best architects had been tempted away to private firms and Thamesmead, the flagship project of the Bennett years, was mired in the intractability of the Erith marshes. Bennett was a vigorous and debonair figurehead, and many of the LCC's best projects were completed under his leadership. But his reputation has been tarnished by the fact that the currents of architectural power and fashion alike ran against him throughout his period at County Hall. His ascent to what looked like the most enviable post in public sector architecture had been a surprise to many. He was a Lancastrian by birth. His father was surveyor and architect to the Duke of Bridgewater's estates near Manchester, so it was to the Manchester School of Architecture that he naturally went, the year after Leslie Martin. He did well, gathered prizes, and spent some time in American offices, admired for their efficiency in the early 1930s.

      "body": "<p>There is something dismaying in a life with nothing to regret and nothing to hide. In the case of Montague Rhodes James, however, this has to be accepted. \"No loveless childhood to be thrust out of mind,\" wrote his biographer, Michael Cox, \"no parental iniquities to be kept secret.\" Monty (as he preferred to be called) was the fourth and youngest child of the rector of Livermere, near Bury St Edmunds. Born in 1862, he spent almost his entire life between Eton and King's College, Cambridge. </p> <p>At King's he gained a double first in classics and was appointed Junior Dean, Dean, Provost and, in 1913, Vice-Chancellor of the University. During this time he had made himself one of the leading authorities on the Apocryphal Books of the Bible and on western medieval manuscripts. In 1918, just before the armistice, he was called back to Eton as Provost. In 1930 he received the Order of Merit. He died in his lodge in June 1936, while in the chapel they were singing the Nunc Dimittis. </p> <p>Monty never married, although he acquired a surrogate family. They were the widow and daughter of a pupil who became a friend, James McBryde. McBryde died early, and Monty became guardian to little Jane. But he was still a bachelor, and a late-Victorian bachelor at that. Probably he felt the greatest pressure on him in 1905, when he was appointed Provost of King's. \"You will have to get a Provostess, that's flat,\" a distinguished friend told him. And Monty, well used to deflecting this argument, would hint at his admiration for a certain actress who was appearing in Peter Pan, but nothing came of it. Much more important to him was the question of ordination. Like Lewis Carroll, he became a deacon, but never a priest. </p> <p>Monty is remembered today for his ghost stories. They are entirely his own, written in an irresistibly appealing manner, in accordance with rules which he had invented for himself. Writing at the end of the 1920s about contemporary \"tales of the supernatural\", he said, \"They drag in sex . . . which is a fatal mistake; sex is tiresome enough in the novels; in a ghost story, or as the backbone of a ghost story, I have no patience with it.\" Certainly sex doesn't trouble his protagonists. It is their unclouded innocence, combined with their serious scholarship, which is precisely Monty's strong card. By way of contrast there are deferential inn-keepers, agents and chambermaids, who may know a little more than their employers, may wink or smile, but are a thousand miles from guessing the shocking truth. </p> <p>His predilection began early. His biographer quotes from a contribution to the Eton Rambler in 1880 (when he was 17): \"Everyone can remember a time when he has carefully searched his curtains - and poked in the dark corners of his room before retiring to rest - with a sort of pleasurable uncertainty as to whether there might not be a saucer-eyed skeleton or a skinny-chested ghost in hiding somewhere. I invariably go through this ceremony myself.\" To the skeleton and the ghost we may add spiders, owls, the sound of voices talking just out of earshot, a creature covered with long hair, a figure cloaked or cowled or with its head in a sack. The Apocrypha too, which had fascinated him very early and continued to do so all his life, has been described by Richard Holmes as \"a somewhat twilight field, neither orthodox biblical studies nor entirely medieval folklore, and it contains many strange presences, such as Solomon and the Demons.\" At the same time, Monty's recreations remained guileless - long bicycle rides with two or three friends, church music, \"his supper, his game of patience, and his bed\". </p> <p>Monty produced his ghost stories at regular intervals, and read them to a Christmas audience of friends in his rooms at King's, blowing out every candle but one. They were published from 1904 to 1931. He also wrote a preface, in which he cautiously answered the question, did he believe in ghosts: \"I am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me.\" That is to say, he used the same criteria as he did in his life as a scholar, teacher and administrator. </p> <p>In Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, Monty introduces dreams that wonderfully suggest the feeling of suffocation and powerlessness that comes with \"dreaming true\". There is Stephen Elliot's dream of a figure of a \"dusty leaden colour\" lying (and smiling) in an old disused bath, WR's dream of a Punch and Judy show, Professor Parkins' dream (or vision) of a man desperately climbing over the groynes on Felixstowe beach, Mr Dillet's dream (or nightmare) in The Haunted Dolls' House. They are equally likely to be projected from the past or from the immediate and inescapable future. In either case, they anticipate the climax of the story, but don't diminish it. Whether Monty himself was troubled by dreams I don't know. In January 1907 he told Arthur Benson (who noted it in his diary) that he was only happy in bed or looking at manuscripts. This hardly sounds like a dreamer, but I am not sure Monty told Benson the whole truth. </p> <p>He was, from first to last, a man of books. \"The library was the obvious place for the after-dinner hours. Candle in hand and pipe in mouth, he moved round the room for some time, taking stock of the titles.\" This is from Mr Humphreys and His Inheritance, but might just as well be about its author. </p> <p> With old-fashioned courtesy he welcomes his readers to his world, just as, when Provost of King's, he welcomed students and friends with tobacco and whisky decanters already laid out in the hall. A natural mimic in real life, he could imitate the style of any period that interested him - it seemed less a deliberate imitation than a natural process, like protective colouring. There was medieval Latin, of course, the \"fragments of ostensible erudition\", as he called them, which persuade us into accepting as real the manuscripts, the inscriptions, the \"rather rare and exceedingly difficult book, The Sertum Steinfeldens Norbertinum\", in his story The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. </p> <p>Ghosts, he declared, should be \"malevolent or odious\", never amiable or helpful. The haunted should be \"introduced in a placid way, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings, and in this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head\". This may be the result, by accident or design, of long-buried secrets, setting retribution to work. Something of the kind seems almost a professional hazard for his visiting scholars and librarians. They have to face, also (in one of Monty's own phrases), \"the malice of inanimate objects\". He speaks, too, of the rules of folk-lore, and says he has tried to make his ghosts act in ways \"not inconsistent with them\". One of the rules of folk stories is that the bad shall come to bad ends, and to this Monty was faithful. But the good (whose only failing may be that they have lived undisturbed so far) are rewarded rather unequally. </p> <p>Take, for example, what to my mind is the best story he ever wrote, The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance [reprinted here]. WR's uncle has not been a wrongdoer, has no hideous secret, hasn't disturbed any long-dead or made any rash experiments, or (most unwise of all) bought or borrowed any questionable old books. How seriously did he take these stories? \"I am told that they have given pleasure of a certain sort to my readers,\" he wrote. \"If so, my whole object in writing them has been attained.\" </p> <p>It was his lifelong habit not to make too much of things. However, they were more than a diversion; they were a declaration of his position. From his schooldays onwards he not only disliked but detested maths and science. At Eton and King's he reduces both these subjects and their teachers to a stream of mildly satirical stories. TH Huxley he referred to as \"a coarse 19th-century stinks man\". Mathematics he equated with suffering. </p> <p>He extended his disapproval, which was more like an intense physical reaction, to philosophy. When he was Dean of King's he overheard two undergraduates disputing a problematic point, and, according to his colleague Nathaniel Wedd, he rapped on the table sharply with his pipe and called out: \"No thinking, gentlemen, please!\" \"Thought,\" Wedd notes in his unpublished memoirs, \"really did disturb Monty through out his life.\" What truly distressed him, however, was the division of King's into the pious and the godless, while in the Cavendish laboratory young physicists were at work constructing new models of a world without God. It was not scientific accuracy that Monty objected to but a sense that mankind was occupying the wrong territory. In 1928, towards the end of his life, he spoke at Gresham's School in defence of an education in the humanities as against \"modern invention or the most intimate knowledge of things that have no soul\". </p> <p>Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad is the story which in literal fact is about a \"sheeted ghost\" - it has \"a horrible, an intensely horrible face of crumpled linen\". Its victim is Professor Parkins, said to be the Professor of Ontography, which I suppose makes him an expert on things as they are. He is certainly a scientist, \"young, neat and precise of speech\", and emphatically a disbeliever, above all in ghosts. Disarmingly, Monty gives Parkins credit where it is due. He is \"something of an old woman - rather hen-like, perhaps\", but \"dauntless and severe in his convictions, and a man deserving of the greatest respect\". He is also the man who, after he has summoned his gruesome visitor, would either have fallen out of the window or lost his wits if help had not come. \"There is nothing more to tell, but, as you may imagine, the Professor's views on certain points are less clear-cut than they used to be. His nerves, too, have suffered.\" So, faced by the obstinate disbeliever, Monty takes his not-so-mild revenge. </p> <p>\u0095 Penelope Fitzgerald, who died in April, wrote this introduction to Penguin's new edition of MR James's The Haunted Dolls' House and Other Stories. \u00a9 Penelope Fitzgerald.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is something dismaying in a life with nothing to regret and nothing to hide. In the case of Montague Rhodes James, however, this has to be accepted. \"No loveless childhood to be thrust out of mind,\" wrote his biographer, Michael Cox, \"no parental iniquities to be kept secret.\" Monty (as he preferred to be called) was the fourth and youngest child of the rector of Livermere, near Bury St Edmunds. Born in 1862, he spent almost his entire life between Eton and King's College, Cambridge. At King's he gained a double first in classics and was appointed Junior Dean, Dean, Provost and, in 1913, Vice-Chancellor of the University. During this time he had made himself one of the leading authorities on the Apocryphal Books of the Bible and on western medieval manuscripts. In 1918, just before the armistice, he was called back to Eton as Provost. In 1930 he received the Order of Merit. He died in his lodge in June 1936, while in the chapel they were singing the Nunc Dimittis. Monty never married, although he acquired a surrogate family. They were the widow and daughter of a pupil who became a friend, James McBryde. McBryde died early, and Monty became guardian to little Jane. But he was still a bachelor, and a late-Victorian bachelor at that. Probably he felt the greatest pressure on him in 1905, when he was appointed Provost of King's. \"You will have to get a Provostess, that's flat,\" a distinguished friend told him. And Monty, well used to deflecting this argument, would hint at his admiration for a certain actress who was appearing in Peter Pan, but nothing came of it. Much more important to him was the question of ordination. Like Lewis Carroll, he became a deacon, but never a priest. Monty is remembered today for his ghost stories. They are entirely his own, written in an irresistibly appealing manner, in accordance with rules which he had invented for himself. Writing at the end of the 1920s about contemporary \"tales of the supernatural\", he said, \"They drag in sex . . . which is a fatal mistake; sex is tiresome enough in the novels; in a ghost story, or as the backbone of a ghost story, I have no patience with it.\" Certainly sex doesn't trouble his protagonists. It is their unclouded innocence, combined with their serious scholarship, which is precisely Monty's strong card. By way of contrast there are deferential inn-keepers, agents and chambermaids, who may know a little more than their employers, may wink or smile, but are a thousand miles from guessing the shocking truth. His predilection began early. His biographer quotes from a contribution to the Eton Rambler in 1880 (when he was 17): \"Everyone can remember a time when he has carefully searched his curtains - and poked in the dark corners of his room before retiring to rest - with a sort of pleasurable uncertainty as to whether there might not be a saucer-eyed skeleton or a skinny-chested ghost in hiding somewhere. I invariably go through this ceremony myself.\" To the skeleton and the ghost we may add spiders, owls, the sound of voices talking just out of earshot, a creature covered with long hair, a figure cloaked or cowled or with its head in a sack. The Apocrypha too, which had fascinated him very early and continued to do so all his life, has been described by Richard Holmes as \"a somewhat twilight field, neither orthodox biblical studies nor entirely medieval folklore, and it contains many strange presences, such as Solomon and the Demons.\" At the same time, Monty's recreations remained guileless - long bicycle rides with two or three friends, church music, \"his supper, his game of patience, and his bed\". Monty produced his ghost stories at regular intervals, and read them to a Christmas audience of friends in his rooms at King's, blowing out every candle but one. They were published from 1904 to 1931. He also wrote a preface, in which he cautiously answered the question, did he believe in ghosts: \"I am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me.\" That is to say, he used the same criteria as he did in his life as a scholar, teacher and administrator. In Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, Monty introduces dreams that wonderfully suggest the feeling of suffocation and powerlessness that comes with \"dreaming true\". There is Stephen Elliot's dream of a figure of a \"dusty leaden colour\" lying (and smiling) in an old disused bath, WR's dream of a Punch and Judy show, Professor Parkins' dream (or vision) of a man desperately climbing over the groynes on Felixstowe beach, Mr Dillet's dream (or nightmare) in The Haunted Dolls' House. They are equally likely to be projected from the past or from the immediate and inescapable future. In either case, they anticipate the climax of the story, but don't diminish it. Whether Monty himself was troubled by dreams I don't know. In January 1907 he told Arthur Benson (who noted it in his diary) that he was only happy in bed or looking at manuscripts. This hardly sounds like a dreamer, but I am not sure Monty told Benson the whole truth. He was, from first to last, a man of books. \"The library was the obvious place for the after-dinner hours.

      "body": "<p>As a teenager growing up in Hertfordshire in the early 60s, Richard Chartres set out to conduct \"a personal Which? report\" on comparative religions. He says his background was very conventional, \"not actively Christian, but not interestingly anti-Christian either\", so he visited the conventional churches: Roman Catholic, various free churches and then the Church of England. </p> <p>The reasons behind his spiritual quest are, of course, complicated. Life at home certainly was not easy. His younger brother had been born brain damaged and, as a consequence, the family had become increasingly socially isolated. Chartres was an earnest and clever boy who thought there must be more to life than these \"flatlands\" he inhabited; the mystery, as he calls it, of his brother's apparent happiness despite his severe disability was a source of intrigue. But whatever Chartres' reasons, when he arrived at the Church of England he was instantly greeted by \"a friendly place full of good people\". They included him in discussions, gave him things to do and quickly accepted him as a valued member of the community. Chartres acknowledges it as a model introduction to the church and a credit to the people who welcomed him. </p> <p>\"There is a strongly held doctrine in some quarters of our church which says that what puts people off is a frosty and distant church and what people want is the warm embrace of a small, Goddy group,\" he explains. \"Well, all I can say is that when I was confronted by [the latter] I ran a mile. I went into this warm, loving, enthusiastic fellowship of Christians and my reaction was to flee. It was obviously my fault, not theirs, but I just couldn't deal with it.\" </p> <p>Chartres has since made his accommodation with the C of E. He is a Right Reverend, a right honourable and the dean of the chapel royal at Windsor. As the Bishop of London he holds the third most important see in the church hierarchy, is on good terms with the royal family and is a strong candidate to succeed George Carey as Archbishop of Canterbury. And all this has been achieved with a personality that is often described as being closer to that of a 19th-century bishop rather than one from the 21st century. He has an unapologetic respect for tradition and a barely disguised contempt for attempts to modernise and, even worse, market the church. </p> <p>This makes him a contentious figure to many fellow Anglicans. His reluctance to ordain women priests places him, not for the first time, out of sync with prevailing orthodoxies. His traditional stance on gay priests - being gay in itself is not a sin but the only two \"life projects\" open to a priest are celibacy or lifelong, faithful, heterosexual marriage - mean he is not liked by more radical elements. Add to this his domed head, beard and sonorous voice, and what you have is something far more like an Orthodox patriarch than a well-meaning but ineffectual C of E vicar. It seems this is just the way he likes it. </p> <p>\"If you look at the representations of the clergy in Punch cartoons through the 20th century it makes for interesting reading,\" he says. \"At the beginning they might have been generally portrayed as black-coated and threatening, but they were never seen as negligible or easily dismissed figures. But as you go on through the century they become these rather pathetic characters in badly fitting sports jackets. Although I believe Marx wasn't wrong about everything, I do think that, far from being a mould that grows on the rock of economics, the spiritual life is actually fundamental. So of course I think it is a pity if the people who in some way symbolise that dimension are universally regarded as wet.\" </p> <p>One man who never thought Chartres was wet was Robert Runcie, the former Archbishop of Canterbury who died earlier this year. Chartres was his chaplain for eight years. \"He had an ability to listen and to communicate without a dangerously uncritical or humourless deference to his boss,\" said Runcie. Reflecting on their relationship in his retirement, Runcie acknowledged that, theologically, the liberal Runcie \"clashed completely\" with Chartres the traditionalist, \"but he greatly influenced me more than I him. He moderated my liberal position, and nourished the roots of my innate conservatism.\" </p> <p>Pete Broadbent, a former Islington Labour councillor, is now archdeacon of Northolt. He says that while Chartres is obviously conservative, people would misread him if they thought of him as only conservative. \"He does have those trappings and he does work well with the establishment, but he is a radical thinker and his approach to life is much more pragmatic than people might think at first sight.\" He is also widely regarded, by all shades of church opinion, as a gen uinely holy man. \"He is undoubtedly one of the brainiest people in the church,\" says one observer, \"but he is not a theological technocrat and he has an authentic spirituality. When you are with him you do think he is the real thing.\" </p> <p>But does any of this really matter? A recent survey revealed that only 25% of the British people even nominally call themselves C of E. Mainstream religion is increasingly marginalised, with a hotchpotch of more or less idiosyncratic versions of spirituality apparently making a stronger pitch. In recent years newspapers have traded astrologers for vast sums of money, an England football coach has been sacked for his views on karma, and rearranging the furniture has been widely accepted as a more effective route to spiritual fulfilment than going to church. </p> <p>\"Any trip to Waterstone's proves there is a strong sense of spiritual awareness,\" says Chartres. \"And yes, it is all very \u00e0 la carte and wacky. But the message is that the country is not atheist. The problem is that when people are disengaged from any major religion they do not believe in nothing; they believe in anything. You cannot combat this \u00e0 la carte religiosity by abdicating or refusing to enter the contest. The great spiritual problem is that many people are in touch with their ideas about God rather than helped in a tradition of spiritual discipline to be in a communication with the living God.\" There is a huge difference between these two, he maintains. \"What we can do is actually say what spiritual practice looks like, and the way we can serve in the present situation is by making sure there is a new, fresh, vigorous and beautiful presentation of the classic Christian narrative.\" </p> <p>Such matters were of little interest in Chartres' home when he was growing up. He was born in Hertfordshire in 1947. His ancestors were Huguenots from near Chartres in France who settled in Ireland in the early 17th century, and he is related to an Irish republican mayor of Cork who died on a hunger strike in 1921. His branch of the family moved to England in the 1920s and his parents, Richard and Charlotte, lived near the Ware pharmaceutical company where Richard senior was the works manager. The birth of his younger brother, Stephen, two years after Richard, was to be the defining moment of his childhood. </p> <p>Stephen was born with a serious thyroid deficiency that left him brain damaged. He never lived independently and died aged 27. Chartres says his parents' Christianity, \"poorly articulated and poorly taught\", couldn't stand up to a combination of the war and this personal tragedy. \"They had had a torrid time and the way Christianity was presented offered them little. It was a rather bland statement that God would look after his own, which of course he does, but sometimes in a very sharp and painful way.\" </p> <p>But Richard took a different message from Stephen's short life. \"It wasn't a tragedy,\" he says. \"He had the most extraordinary quality of happiness, which was a great blessing. And the mystery of that, of why he was so free even though he was excluded from the race for glittering prizes that for most of us makes life worth living, is really where I started.\" </p> <p>After school at Hertford Grammar, Chartres won a place at Trinity College, Cambridge - on his father's advice, because his grandfather had been to Trinity - to read history. The family had been very socially isolated because of his brother's condition and, he says, it was not until he went to Cambridge that he discovered that people actually stayed at each other's houses. It was not until he left university that he discovered that his father had actually meant Trinity College, Dublin, and not Cambridge. \"He was a very laconic man,\" he explains. </p> <p>Chartres describes himself as a student as, \"extraordinarily naive. I really must have been a bit odd\". Christopher Courtauld, the chaplain of Trinity, remembers him as \"one of the more striking undergraduates. He was very much his own man and I seem to remember him in a bowler hat, which shows he wasn't a slave to any sort of fashion.\" Courtauld says Chartres was part of a group of what would later be called young fogeys. \"They were an attractive group of young men who stood out for a more traditional way of life and values as against the modernising tendency of the student majority.\" </p> <p>One of Chartres' friends was Robert Woods, who now works for the container shipping firm P&amp;O Nedlloyd. \"Richard was very bright and able, and full of vigour and enthusiasm. He very much wanted to preserve what was best in the church from all ages, but he wasn't immune to the radicalism of the time. He listened and understood what was going, and while he didn't really sympathise he could comprehend it.\" </p> <p>Chartres says now: \"I saw absolutely no need for all of the turmoil in the 60s. While I never joined the Conservative party - I've never had much time for party politics - I was deeply conservative. Under the influence of a religion and the Christian gospel I have changed some of my ideas. But I've always had a great sense of what is good about the national story, for instance.\" At Cambridge he came into contact with this national story in human form when he met and became friends with Prince Charles. He says their meeting did not present any difficulties in terms of being outside his social sphere, \"because I never had a social sphere. In some ways I was and am d\u00e9class\u00e9 . I was incredibly ignorant.\" The links with Prince Charles have endured. Chartres was chosen to confirm Prince William - in what was seen by some at the time as a snub to the Archbishop of Canterbury - and was made an executor of Princess Diana's will. </p> <p>Chartres was confirmed at Cambridge and says the university and the chapel were two important intellectual poles for him. \"There seemed to be something real there I could engage with.\" He says there was no single moment when he knew he wanted to become a priest. \"The Book of Common Prayer, with its sobriety and clarity, was certainly important in my joining the Church of England, and I wish I could say there was one great figure who exercised a mesmerising effect on me, but there wasn't.\" </p> <p>Following his graduation in 1968 he enrolled at Cuddesdon theological college in Oxford. It was not a happy experience and he left, his course unfinished, after 18 months. A period of spiritual doubt? \"No,\" he roars, \"precisely the opposite. I had no doubts whatsoever; that was the problem.\" Chartres was a controver sial figure at Cuddesdon. The ripples of late-60s radicalism had already reached the theological colleges and he found himself in a tiny minority voting against virtually all change. \"I thought it was all dumbing down and chucking everything out of the window. I still think I was right but I was less than charitable to those with whom I disagreed. I do now think they were doing their best.\" </p> <p>He was told that \"there would be no future for a person of my views in the modern church of England\". When the principal - Robert Runcie, who had been indulgent of Chartres - left, he thought it was best that he should withdraw too. \"It was my decision but I did so under a cloud. It would have been more interesting on my CV to have been expelled but that wasn't the case.\" </p> <p>He then entered what he calls his \"university of life\" phase. He taught ancient history at the international school in Seville, sold Christmas trees and was an extra-orders clerk in the Sainsbury's wine and spirits depot. In the mid-80s he had a sec ond crack at a career outside the church when he was briefly made religious correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>\"Everyone liked having him around,\" says Evening Standard editor Max Hastings, who was the editor at the Telegraph at the time, \"but, and I think he would agree, he didn't really have a very highly developed news sense. When I first met him as Bishop of London some years later he said, 'You may have forgotten, but the last time we met you sacked me.' But he's always been terribly nice about it and as far as I know no divine curses have been heaped on me.\" </p> <p>In 1972 Chartres entered the theological college at Lincoln. While there he spent a lot of time at the Samaritans centre. \"I learned you should never assume that you can help someone or not help them. When a student would come in with some existential problem I thought I could deal with it, but I was hopeless and Vera [a fellow volunteer], who would sit there with her knitting saying, 'Oh yes, oh yes,' was immensely helpful. Then a woman whose experience of life was completely different to my own, beaten by her husband, for some extraordinary reason found it possible to talk to me. It was an important education and gave me an insight into the quiet despair of so many people's lives.\" </p> <p>This time he finished the course, and he was ordained in Bedford in 1973. During the ordination retreat he was so obviously disabled by nerves that Robert Runcie, who was conducting the ordination as the Bishop of St Albans, was asked whether it was wise to continue. Runcie said he believed \"that the grace of holy orders will work well on him\", and went ahead anyway. Chartres says that his intense response to aspects of his calling has not changed. \"I'm not easy and content with the world,\" he explains. \"I'm not at home in this dispensation, as TS Eliot puts it. It can be a terrifying thought to be a priest. You are trusted beyond your deserts. People relate to the role and that is a considerable responsibility.\" </p> <p>In 1975, much to the consternation of the rest of the diocese staff, Runcie asked Chartres to become his chaplain. Chartres says the relationship was less like a French king and his confessor and more like a minister and his civil-service private secretary. \"I was Bernard in Yes Minister,\" he explains. \"Mostly administrative, but it was a very good education. I discovered how the church worked.\" </p> <p>He says the setup at St Albans was very old-fashioned. His bedroom was also his office and he had meals with the Runcie family. Crucially he struck up a good relationship with Runcie's wife, Lindy. \"He's one of my favourite people,\" she says. \"Very amusing and very clever. He helped me with my Italian A-level.\" </p> <p>When Runcie was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1980, Chartres moved with him to Lambeth Palace. In his controversial biography of the archbishop, Humphrey Carpenter recorded Runcie's views on Chartres' influence. Runcie said he was \"very powerful. He seemed to know what was going on in one's mind. I mean, if somebody had been to visit me, Richard would say four things about that person which I hadn't noticed at all. And for the first time in my life, perhaps, I had an inferiority complex, which I never overcame. Yes, I think that he did have a sort of mastery over me.\" </p> <p>It was Chartres who drafted Runcie's controversial Falklands sermon that so annoyed Mrs Thatcher with its reference to the Argentine as well as the British dead. \"But by the time he said it he had internalised it and was committed to it,\" says Chartres. \"He was always his own man and knew exactly what would wash and what he could say. If you read it now it is very modest, basic Christianity that teaches that war, while it might occasionally be the lesser of two evils, is always a failure. He said it as a person who had seen war at first hand and thank God he did say it.\" </p> <p>In Carpenter's biography Chartres was called both Svengali and Rasputin. \"Far too generous,\" he laughs. \"One would have been praise, but both is really too much.\" But the Russian allusion is based on more than just his appearance and influence. He is the C of E's link to orthodoxy and has a strong emotional attachment to Russia in particular. He befriended and subsequently baptised a communist editor of Pravda. The man, whose name he would rather keep private to protect his children, later became a godfather to one of Chartres' children before being murdered by the Russian Mafia. He is deeply moved by the suffering of the Russian people during the last century and is fascinated by the role of the Russian church. \"Despite the terrible and huge-scale experiment of godless materialism, a way forward has been found. And Russian orthodoxy is of enormous significance for European peace. The Russian orthodox church has 70m believers and plays an enormously important part in the recovery of identity for the Russian people.\" </p> <p>After Chartres and Runcie had left Canterbury another chapter of global politics ensured that Chartres was called back for one piece of unfinished business. They had both worked closely with Terry Waite at Lambeth Palace, but by the time Waite was released from captivity in Lebanon in 1995 there were comparatively few people there who knew him, so Chartres was sent to Syria to bring him home. Waite sees him as \"the very best kind of English cleric in that he has scholarship and spirituality. He could dig out the most obscure historical references. When Robert Runcie was under some political attack or other, Richard pointed out that this was nothing, 'Archbishop Alfege was beaten to death with mutton bones. That was real trouble.' \" </p> <p>Chartres says that being Runcie's chaplain changed everything for him in that it gave him all sorts of experience, but after eight years he wanted to become a priest, \"to hear people's stories. Also it was a job only an unmarried person could have done because you worked round the clock.\" In 1982 he married Caroline McLintock and in 1984 he left Runcie to become the vicar of St Stephen with St John in Westminster. Chartres had met Caroline when she was his secretary. Her father, Alan McLintock, chairs the audit committee of the Church Commissioners. She is a universally popular figure in the church for her good humour, energy and common sense. The general consensus is that she has humanised Chartres and saved him from any propensity he might have had since childhood to melancholia. She recently completed a postgraduate diploma in special needs education and teaches three days a week. She is also a freelance journalist and contributes a diary column to Church Times. Paul Handley, its editor, praises her lightness of touch in mocking the formal side of the life of a bishop's wife. \"She has a finely judged line in exasperation with bits of the lifestyle, and the readers love her.\" </p> <p>Chartres and his wife have two boys and two girls aged between seven and 13 and live in a flat above the Old Deanery opposite St Paul's. There was some grumbling when Chartres moved into this apparently grand home following his promotion to London, but the bulk of the building is office and meeting space. \"I can look the most junior curate in the Stepney area in the face and say that probably his accommodation is in many ways superior to ours. Their children might have some space to run around, while mine don't.\" </p> <p>He says he now knows about Pok\u00e9mon but probably could not name all the Spice Girls. And, of course, he has read Harry Potter. Some Christians have raised objections to its portrayal of magic. Does he have any theological problems with it? \"Oh, come off it,\" he guffaws. \"Children's stories have always been full of magic and marvels and here is an attractive group of three children having adventures in a fantasy environment which involves giving the evil lord a bloody nose. That seems to me rather good news. I've never had any difficulty in reading fairy stories to my children and I'd happily supply a chaplain to Hogwarts for next term.\" </p> <p>Chartres was made Bishop of Stepney in 1992 and then stepped up to the London job, unexpectedly quickly, in 1995. He was seen as a continuity candidate in the diocese, although he is \"perfectly well aware that there are people who think still that there is no future for a person of my views in the Church of England\". London is an extremely difficult diocese to manage and there is criticism from some frontline priests who think he has ducked administrative decisions which has resulted in unwanted City churches staying open while priests in poorer areas are denied resources. </p> <p>But his diocese is bucking the national trend by increasing congregations and Chartres declares himself \"more and more excited by the room for manoeuvre and the potential in this job. I'm overworked, I'm tired, I'm sponsored by Nurofen. But I'm not despondent. I have been gloomy for much of my life but I have been rescued. I tended to see myself as Cassandra, fated to speak the truth but never to be believed. But that is a cop-out and an indulgence. In the second half of my life I have said to myself, 'Come on, you could really make this work.' \" That also means dealing with a series of highly sensitive theological and political conundrums. Richard Kirker is the director of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement in London. He says that \"homosexuality and the Church of England are linked in a generally unhealthy and destructive relationship. And Richard has as unhealthy a relationship to lesbians and gay people as does almost every other bishop. There is a huge level of denial at the highest levels, as they all know there are a large number of homosexuals working for the church, and if you removed all homosexual priests from London, for example, you would only have a third to a half of the clergy left.\" </p> <p>Chartres acknowledges that some of the most talented priests in the church are of homosexual orientation, but defends his insistence on either celibacy or marriage. \"I'm not a maverick,\" he says. \"I'm a bishop and I have a responsibility not to muse and attitudinise, but to simply say what is the position of the church.\" That said, he has gone out of his way to prevent witch-hunts of gay priests in a policy that has been called - not by him - \"don't ask, don't tell\". \"I resist any attempt to make assumptions about people's friendships and rela tionships,\" he says. \"There is a lot of damage done by an exaggeration of the place of sex in people's lives. I refuse to keep on assuming that people are not truthful and don't have friendships and companionships that need not necessarily amount to sexual relations.\" </p> <p>While this issue is contentious, the question of women priests is far more important in terms of the church, and could prove an obstacle to Chartres promotion to Canterbury. While he ordains both women and men as deacons - the first stage of entering the priesthood - he has not ordained any women priests. \"All priests, men and women, are ordained by the area bishops,\" he explains. \"My duty is to secure unity but not uniformity. We have a cohort in this diocese of very able women priests, and I'm their bishop as well. I don't find it difficult to celebrate what an incredible contribution they make.\" </p> <p>He says only a fool would argue for the inequality of men and women but adds that there is still a fascinating debate to be had around whether equality should be tantamount to interchangeability. \"I'm not sure we as a society haven't really sorted out what the social consequences of that will be. Is Sir Charles Guthrie right that the British public is not yet ready for women to be bodies on the battlefield as frontline troops? But I'm not an impossibilist. Women priests have been ordained, I have stayed in the Church of England and I expect to die in it.\" </p> <p>Christina Rees, the chair of Women and the Church, says that Chartres has been personally very supportive towards women in his diocese. \"His compromise of not ordaining anyone can be seen as a generous gesture. And as he is not an impossibilist he may change his views. This is conjecture, but there are some people I can't imagine ever changing their views. He is actually one of the current bishops I can imagine changing his views.\" </p> <p>As for the prospect of him going to Canterbury, he is sceptical without ruling it out. \"When I say I'd be the first to join a 'stop Chartres' group it is not Uriah Heep-like abnegation. I have perhaps a unique insight into just how complex and difficult and burdensome the job is and I think I'm in the right place here, and I suspect the church needs some other type of person when the present incumbent retires.\" </p> <p>In the meantime he is preparing to take his first three-month sabbatical leave for 25 years. But first is Christmas. \"The reason why so many people are so bloody miserable at Christmas is that there has been no Advent in their lives,\" he says. \"I found Christmas hell when I was growing up. The marvellous phrase, 'Why aren't you enjoying yourself?' can be terribly destructive.\" He explains that Advent is supposed to be a penitential time, like Lent, preparing for Christmas. \"It is essential we spend time preparing, opening the doors and the windows to the soul. There can be no carnival without the ensuing Lent and without these rhythms life is a featureless flatland. But now, as one enters into the drama and pattern of a year with rhythm and shape, the incarnation - the birth of God - in the interior life of people is thrilling. That is Christmas.

      "bodyText": "As a teenager growing up in Hertfordshire in the early 60s, Richard Chartres set out to conduct \"a personal Which? report\" on comparative religions. He says his background was very conventional, \"not actively Christian, but not interestingly anti-Christian either\", so he visited the conventional churches: Roman Catholic, various free churches and then the Church of England. The reasons behind his spiritual quest are, of course, complicated. Life at home certainly was not easy. His younger brother had been born brain damaged and, as a consequence, the family had become increasingly socially isolated. Chartres was an earnest and clever boy who thought there must be more to life than these \"flatlands\" he inhabited; the mystery, as he calls it, of his brother's apparent happiness despite his severe disability was a source of intrigue. But whatever Chartres' reasons, when he arrived at the Church of England he was instantly greeted by \"a friendly place full of good people\". They included him in discussions, gave him things to do and quickly accepted him as a valued member of the community. Chartres acknowledges it as a model introduction to the church and a credit to the people who welcomed him. \"There is a strongly held doctrine in some quarters of our church which says that what puts people off is a frosty and distant church and what people want is the warm embrace of a small, Goddy group,\" he explains. \"Well, all I can say is that when I was confronted by [the latter] I ran a mile. I went into this warm, loving, enthusiastic fellowship of Christians and my reaction was to flee. It was obviously my fault, not theirs, but I just couldn't deal with it.\" Chartres has since made his accommodation with the C of E. He is a Right Reverend, a right honourable and the dean of the chapel royal at Windsor. As the Bishop of London he holds the third most important see in the church hierarchy, is on good terms with the royal family and is a strong candidate to succeed George Carey as Archbishop of Canterbury. And all this has been achieved with a personality that is often described as being closer to that of a 19th-century bishop rather than one from the 21st century. He has an unapologetic respect for tradition and a barely disguised contempt for attempts to modernise and, even worse, market the church. This makes him a contentious figure to many fellow Anglicans. His reluctance to ordain women priests places him, not for the first time, out of sync with prevailing orthodoxies. His traditional stance on gay priests - being gay in itself is not a sin but the only two \"life projects\" open to a priest are celibacy or lifelong, faithful, heterosexual marriage - mean he is not liked by more radical elements. Add to this his domed head, beard and sonorous voice, and what you have is something far more like an Orthodox patriarch than a well-meaning but ineffectual C of E vicar. It seems this is just the way he likes it. \"If you look at the representations of the clergy in Punch cartoons through the 20th century it makes for interesting reading,\" he says. \"At the beginning they might have been generally portrayed as black-coated and threatening, but they were never seen as negligible or easily dismissed figures. But as you go on through the century they become these rather pathetic characters in badly fitting sports jackets. Although I believe Marx wasn't wrong about everything, I do think that, far from being a mould that grows on the rock of economics, the spiritual life is actually fundamental. So of course I think it is a pity if the people who in some way symbolise that dimension are universally regarded as wet.\" One man who never thought Chartres was wet was Robert Runcie, the former Archbishop of Canterbury who died earlier this year. Chartres was his chaplain for eight years. \"He had an ability to listen and to communicate without a dangerously uncritical or humourless deference to his boss,\" said Runcie. Reflecting on their relationship in his retirement, Runcie acknowledged that, theologically, the liberal Runcie \"clashed completely\" with Chartres the traditionalist, \"but he greatly influenced me more than I him. He moderated my liberal position, and nourished the roots of my innate conservatism.\" Pete Broadbent, a former Islington Labour councillor, is now archdeacon of Northolt. He says that while Chartres is obviously conservative, people would misread him if they thought of him as only conservative. \"He does have those trappings and he does work well with the establishment, but he is a radical thinker and his approach to life is much more pragmatic than people might think at first sight.\" He is also widely regarded, by all shades of church opinion, as a gen uinely holy man. \"He is undoubtedly one of the brainiest people in the church,\" says one observer, \"but he is not a theological technocrat and he has an authentic spirituality. When you are with him you do think he is the real thing.\" But does any of this really matter? A recent survey revealed that only 25% of the British people even nominally call themselves C of E. Mainstream religion is increasingly marginalised, with a hotchpotch of more or less idiosyncratic versions of spirituality apparently making a stronger pitch. In recent years newspapers have traded astrologers for vast sums of money, an England football coach has been sacked for his views on karma, and rearranging the furniture has been widely accepted as a more effective route to spiritual fulfilment than going to church. \"Any trip to Waterstone's proves there is a strong sense of spiritual awareness,\" says Chartres. \"And yes, it is all very \u00e0 la carte and wacky. But the message is that the country is not atheist. The problem is that when people are disengaged from any major religion they do not believe in nothing; they believe in anything. You cannot combat this \u00e0 la carte religiosity by abdicating or refusing to enter the contest. The great spiritual problem is that many people are in touch with their ideas about God rather than helped in a tradition of spiritual discipline to be in a communication with the living God.\" There is a huge difference between these two, he maintains. \"What we can do is actually say what spiritual practice looks like, and the way we can serve in the present situation is by making sure there is a new, fresh, vigorous and beautiful presentation of the classic Christian narrative.\" Such matters were of little interest in Chartres' home when he was growing up. He was born in Hertfordshire in 1947. His ancestors were Huguenots from near Chartres in France who settled in Ireland in the early 17th century, and he is related to an Irish republican mayor of Cork who died on a hunger strike in 1921. His branch of the family moved to England in the 1920s and his parents, Richard and Charlotte, lived near the Ware pharmaceutical company where Richard senior was the works manager. The birth of his younger brother, Stephen, two years after Richard, was to be the defining moment of his childhood. Stephen was born with a serious thyroid deficiency that left him brain damaged. He never lived independently and died aged 27. Chartres says his parents' Christianity, \"poorly articulated and poorly taught\", couldn't stand up to a combination of the war and this personal tragedy. \"They had had a torrid time and the way Christianity was presented offered them little. It was a rather bland statement that God would look after his own, which of course he does, but sometimes in a very sharp and painful way.\" But Richard took a different message from Stephen's short life. \"It wasn't a tragedy,\" he says. \"He had the most extraordinary quality of happiness, which was a great blessing. And the mystery of that, of why he was so free even though he was excluded from the race for glittering prizes that for most of us makes life worth living, is really where I started.\" After school at Hertford Grammar, Chartres won a place at Trinity College, Cambridge - on his father's advice, because his grandfather had been to Trinity - to read history. The family had been very socially isolated because of his brother's condition and, he says, it was not until he went to Cambridge that he discovered that people actually stayed at each other's houses. It was not until he left university that he discovered that his father had actually meant Trinity College, Dublin, and not Cambridge. \"He was a very laconic man,\" he explains. Chartres describes himself as a student as, \"extraordinarily naive. I really must have been a bit odd\". Christopher Courtauld, the chaplain of Trinity, remembers him as \"one of the more striking undergraduates. He was very much his own man and I seem to remember him in a bowler hat, which shows he wasn't a slave to any sort of fashion.\" Courtauld says Chartres was part of a group of what would later be called young fogeys. \"They were an attractive group of young men who stood out for a more traditional way of life and values as against the modernising tendency of the student majority.\" One of Chartres' friends was Robert Woods, who now works for the container shipping firm P&amp;O Nedlloyd. \"Richard was very bright and able, and full of vigour and enthusiasm. He very much wanted to preserve what was best in the church from all ages, but he wasn't immune to the radicalism of the time. He listened and understood what was going, and while he didn't really sympathise he could comprehend it.\" Chartres says now: \"I saw absolutely no need for all of the turmoil in the 60s. While I never joined the Conservative party - I've never had much time for party politics - I was deeply conservative. Under the influence of a religion and the Christian gospel I have changed some of my ideas. But I've always had a great sense of what is good about the national story, for instance.\" At Cambridge he came into contact with this national story in human form when he met and became friends with Prince Charles. He says their meeting did not present any difficulties in terms of being outside his social sphere, \"because I never had a social sphere. In some ways I was and am d\u00e9class\u00e9 . I was incredibly ignorant.\" The links with Prince Charles have endured. Chartres was chosen to confirm Prince William - in what was seen by some at the time as a snub to the Archbishop of Canterbury - and was made an executor of Princess Diana's will. Chartres was confirmed at Cambridge and says the university and the chapel were two important intellectual poles for him. \"There seemed to be something real there I could engage with.\" He says there was no single moment when he knew he wanted to become a priest. \"The Book of Common Prayer, with its sobriety and clarity, was certainly important in my joining the Church of England, and I wish I could say there was one great figure who exercised a mesmerising effect on me, but there wasn't.\" Following his graduation in 1968 he enrolled at Cuddesdon theological college in Oxford. It was not a happy experience and he left, his course unfinished, after 18 months. A period of spiritual doubt? \"No,\" he roars, \"precisely the opposite. I had no doubts whatsoever; that was the problem.\" Chartres was a controver sial figure at Cuddesdon. The ripples of late-60s radicalism had already reached the theological colleges and he found himself in a tiny minority voting against virtually all change. \"I thought it was all dumbing down and chucking everything out of the window. I still think I was right but I was less than charitable to those with whom I disagreed. I do now think they were doing their best.\" He was told that \"there would be no future for a person of my views in the modern church of England\". When the principal - Robert Runcie, who had been indulgent of Chartres - left, he thought it was best that he should withdraw too. \"It was my decision but I did so under a cloud. It would have been more interesting on my CV to have been expelled but that wasn't the case.\" He then entered what he calls his \"university of life\" phase. He taught ancient history at the international school in Seville, sold Christmas trees and was an extra-orders clerk in the Sainsbury's wine and spirits depot. In the mid-80s he had a sec ond crack at a career outside the church when he was briefly made religious correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. \"Everyone liked having him around,\" says Evening Standard editor Max Hastings, who was the editor at the Telegraph at the time, \"but, and I think he would agree, he didn't really have a very highly developed news sense. When I first met him as Bishop of London some years later he said, 'You may have forgotten, but the last time we met you sacked me.' But he's always been terribly nice about it and as far as I know no divine curses have been heaped on me.\" In 1972 Chartres entered the theological college at Lincoln. While there he spent a lot of time at the Samaritans centre. \"I learned you should never assume that you can help someone or not help them. When a student would come in with some existential problem I thought I could deal with it, but I was hopeless and Vera [a fellow volunteer], who would sit there with her knitting saying, 'Oh yes, oh yes,' was immensely helpful. Then a woman whose experience of life was completely different to my own, beaten by her husband, for some extraordinary reason found it possible to talk to me. It was an important education and gave me an insight into the quiet despair of so many people's lives.\" This time he finished the course, and he was ordained in Bedford in 1973. During the ordination retreat he was so obviously disabled by nerves that Robert Runcie, who was conducting the ordination as the Bishop of St Albans, was asked whether it was wise to continue. Runcie said he believed \"that the grace of holy orders will work well on him\", and went ahead anyway. Chartres says that his intense response to aspects of his calling has not changed. \"I'm not easy and content with the world,\" he explains. \"I'm not at home in this dispensation, as TS Eliot puts it. It can be a terrifying thought to be a priest. You are trusted beyond your deserts. People relate to the role and that is a considerable responsibility.\" In 1975, much to the consternation of the rest of the diocese staff, Runcie asked Chartres to become his chaplain. Chartres says the relationship was less like a French king and his confessor and more like a minister and his civil-service private secretary. \"I was Bernard in Yes Minister,\" he explains. \"Mostly administrative, but it was a very good education. I discovered how the church worked.\" He says the setup at St Albans was very old-fashioned. His bedroom was also his office and he had meals with the Runcie family. Crucially he struck up a good relationship with Runcie's wife, Lindy. \"He's one of my favourite people,\" she says. \"Very amusing and very clever. He helped me with my Italian A-level.\" When Runcie was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1980, Chartres moved with him to Lambeth Palace. In his controversial biography of the archbishop, Humphrey Carpenter recorded Runcie's views on Chartres' influence. Runcie said he was \"very powerful. He seemed to know what was going on in one's mind. I mean, if somebody had been to visit me, Richard would say four things about that person which I hadn't noticed at all. And for the first time in my life, perhaps, I had an inferiority complex, which I never overcame. Yes, I think that he did have a sort of mastery over me.\" It was Chartres who drafted Runcie's controversial Falklands sermon that so annoyed Mrs Thatcher with its reference to the Argentine as well as the British dead. \"But by the time he said it he had internalised it and was committed to it,\" says Chartres. \"He was always his own man and knew exactly what would wash and what he could say. If you read it now it is very modest, basic Christianity that teaches that war, while it might occasionally be the lesser of two evils, is always a failure. He said it as a person who had seen war at first hand and thank God he did say it.\" In Carpenter's biography Chartres was called both Svengali and Rasputin. \"Far too generous,\" he laughs. \"One would have been praise, but both is really too much.\" But the Russian allusion is based on more than just his appearance and influence. He is the C of E's link to orthodoxy and has a strong emotional attachment to Russia in particular. He befriended and subsequently baptised a communist editor of Pravda. The man, whose name he would rather keep private to protect his children, later became a godfather to one of Chartres' children before being murdered by the Russian Mafia. He is deeply moved by the suffering of the Russian people during the last century and is fascinated by the role of the Russian church. \"Despite the terrible and huge-scale experiment of godless materialism, a way forward has been found. And Russian orthodoxy is of enormous significance for European peace. The Russian orthodox church has 70m believers and plays an enormously important part in the recovery of identity for the Russian people.\" After Chartres and Runcie had left Canterbury another chapter of global politics ensured that Chartres was called back for one piece of unfinished business. They had both worked closely with Terry Waite at Lambeth Palace, but by the time Waite was released from captivity in Lebanon in 1995 there were comparatively few people there who knew him, so Chartres was sent to Syria to bring him home.

I don't find it difficult to celebrate what an incredible contribution they make.\" He says only a fool would argue for the inequality of men and women but adds that there is still a fascinating debate to be had around whether equality should be tantamount to interchangeability. \"I'm not sure we as a society haven't really sorted out what the social consequences of that will be. Is Sir Charles Guthrie right that the British public is not yet ready for women to be bodies on the battlefield as frontline troops? But I'm not an impossibilist. Women priests have been ordained, I have stayed in the Church of England and I expect to die in it.\" Christina Rees, the chair of Women and the Church, says that Chartres has been personally very supportive towards women in his diocese. \"His compromise of not ordaining anyone can be seen as a generous gesture. And as he is not an impossibilist he may change his views. This is conjecture, but there are some people I can't imagine ever changing their views. He is actually one of the current bishops I can imagine changing his views.\" As for the prospect of him going to Canterbury, he is sceptical without ruling it out. \"When I say I'd be the first to join a 'stop Chartres' group it is not Uriah Heep-like abnegation. I have perhaps a unique insight into just how complex and difficult and burdensome the job is and I think I'm in the right place here, and I suspect the church needs some other type of person when the present incumbent retires.\" In the meantime he is preparing to take his first three-month sabbatical leave for 25 years. But first is Christmas. \"The reason why so many people are so bloody miserable at Christmas is that there has been no Advent in their lives,\" he says. \"I found Christmas hell when I was growing up. The marvellous phrase, 'Why aren't you enjoying yourself?' can be terribly destructive.\" He explains that Advent is supposed to be a penitential time, like Lent, preparing for Christmas. \"It is essential we spend time preparing, opening the doors and the windows to the soul. There can be no carnival without the ensuing Lent and without these rhythms life is a featureless flatland. But now, as one enters into the drama and pattern of a year with rhythm and shape, the incarnation - the birth of God - in the interior life of people is thrilling. That is Christmas. It is a wonderful season.\" Life at a glance: Richard John Carew Chartres Born: July 11 1947, Hertfordshire.

      "body": "<p>Christmas fair bursts with traditions, from little biscuits named for obscure third-century martyrs to 12 flying red-nosed reindeer pulling a sparkly sled spilling over with brightly coloured packages. It seems that even the date of the birth of Christ was chosen to whisk in numerous key days and traditions at once, mainly the winter solstice, the Yule, Saturnalia and the Jewish Feast of Lights. Frankly, Christmas is an exhausting business - and that's before the first glass of Madeira. I would be more than happy to embrace traditions, centuries of them, in fact, if they resembled the opening sequence to the film of Fiddler On The Roof. Watching Topol burst forth singing Tradition with a voice big enough to blow off the dome of St Paul's, then fast-forwarding to the thoroughly splendid bottle dance at that wedding is grand stuff indeed.</p> <p>These days, I am afraid to say that, with damned few exceptions, traditions do less and less for me, especially when they are trundled out for no better reason than \"It's that time of year again\". I tend to wish it wasn't. Of course, the most enduring (and demanding) of all Christmas traditions is the Christmas pudding. It is even more of a tradition than the blessed turkey, and can be a real great, provided the recipe predates the greater part of the Victorian era. The recipes since then are, on the whole, abominable.</p> <p>Eliza Acton's recipe for Christmas pudding is frequently quoted by chefs and food writers as the most authentic - and too true to be good it is, too. However, there are a great many steamed puddings of which I am inordinately fond, and I am quite happy to eat them at any time of year - yes, even this one. Outside the rare slice of fruit cake, dried fruits hardly see the light of day except at Christmas, when we seem to gorge on them as we demolish untold quantities of puddings and pies, cakes and pastries. One memorable Christmas, my Ma really lost the plot and cooked six different cakes, which caused great rebellion followed by much pleading for mercy.</p> <p>Dried fruits - and I mean here the squidgy and yielding kind as opposed to the chippy, insect-like varieties that seem to dry out cakes instead of moistening them - figure greatly in Les Treize Desserts of Provence. This great sequence follows a fish course, frequently the equally indigestible brandade de morue. As fruits on their own terms, raisins and apricots - not to mention almonds, hazelnuts, grapes, nougat, and pears - all feature on the table on Christmas Eve, along with little biscuits and a tart, such as one made with spinach. It's rather reassuring to know that on Christmas Day the gastronomically minded folk of Provence may have something a little simpler to eat, such as turkey stuffed with truffles.</p> <p>I may burn in hell for voicing such heretical ideas with which to round off the Christmas lunch, but my defence is this: memorable meals are worth paying a price for. While I'm at it, I may as well suggest my own preferred close to the festive meal: some freshly cooked pastries, served with just-churned ice cream. Failing that, I'd make up a pretty scene of platters, both flat and pedestalled, piled high with little biscuits and pastries, some of them fine and crisp, others soft and yielding, but all delicious. And don't forget to wash them down with a glass or two of sweet, mellow wine.</p> <p>It may even prove amusing to watch your companions' pleasure at this eminently kinder fin de repas than the traditional pud - although, if truth be told, it will probably not be that much of a relief after everything has been devoured. All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b>Fruit and nut tart </b><br></p> <p>I first ate a tart similar to this in Rome. I have never thought of a suitable name for it, hence the lacklustre appellation. The tart, however, is wonderful.</p> <p><b> For the pastry </b><br></p> <p><b> 250g plain flour </b><br><b> 125g unsalted butter </b><br><b> 1 tbsp icing sugar </b><br><b> 1 egg </b><br><b> 1 tbsp cold water </b></p> <p><b> For the filling </b><br></p> <p><b>100g almonds </b><br><b> 30g walnuts </b><br><b> 30g hazelnuts </b><br><b> 100g unsalted butter</b><br><b> 100g caster sugar</b><br><b> 2 fresh eggs </b><br><b> 30g plain bitter chocolate, broken into pieces</b><br><b> Zest of 1 orange </b><br><b> 30g raisins</b><br><b> 20g sultanas </b><br><b> 30ml Marsala </b><br></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. In a bowl, work the butter, flour and icing sugar together until they are the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and water, and knead lightly into a dough. Wrap in clingfilm, and refrigerate for at least an hour. Roughly chop the nuts. Soften the butter and beat with the sugar until pale and creamy. Crack the eggs into a cup and beat with a fork. Slowly pour the egg on to the butter and sugar, and mix, though not so roughly that it separates. Stir in all the other ingredients. Line a deep, fluted tart case with the pastry and chill for half an hour. Line the pastry with silicon paper and fill with beans or somesuch. Bake for 20 minutes, until pale and somewhat dried. Remove the paper and beans, and return the case to the oven to dry. Tip the filling into the tart just up to the lip - use any excess in a pie or for biscuits - and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the tart has a gorgeous crust and has taken on a rich hue. Serve with lightly whipped double cream.</p> <p><b>Ravioli San Giuseppe </b><br></p> <p>I love these so much that I have made them every Christmas at Blue Print since leaving Alastair Little, where I first came across them. <br></p> <p><b> For the dough </b><br></p> <p><b> 450g flour </b><br><b> 140g caster sugar </b><br><b> 255g unsalted butter</b><br><b> 2 eggs </b><br><b> 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest </b><br><b> Salt </b><br></p> <p><b> For the filling </b><br></p> <p><b> 1 heaped tsp China tea </b><br><b> 12 prunes </b><br><b> 675g caster sugar </b><br><b> 115g pinenuts</b><br><b> 900g Cox's apples</b><br></p> <p>Make the dough by putting the flour and sugar into the food processor. Cut the butter into small pieces, add to the flour/sugar mix, and work until it is the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Add the eggs, lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Knead lightly into a dough, then cover and leave to rest in the fridge.</p> <p>Put the tea with the prunes in a pot, barely cover with boiling water, add three teaspoons of the sugar, then leave to infuse for a couple of hours. Bake the pinenuts in a warm oven until they have turned golden brown. Drain and stone the prunes. Peel, core and chop the apples, then place them in a heavy bottomed pot with the remaining sugar and a splash of water. Cook the apples gently over medium heat, shaking the pan until the sugar begins to colour and the apples begin to pulp. Keep pushing the surface down as the mixture begins to caramelise lightly.</p> <p>Continue to move the pot from time to time, and when the apples have formed a thick, rich paste, add the pine kernels and prunes. Mix together, then decant into a bowl or sterilised jar - this will keep for several weeks. Once you are ready to assemble your ravioli, roll out the dough quite thin and cut into 5cm discs. Place a small spoonful of the prune filling in the centre of each, and brush half the edge with a little water. Fold over to seal the filling within, and place on a baking sheet. Pre-heat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4, and bake for five minutes. Flip over, and cook for another five minutes. Serve with cinnamon ice cream.</p> <p><b>Sweet spinach tart </b><br></p> <p>I have adapted this recipe slightly from Jane Grigson - it is one of the few 'made' pieces of the great Treize Desserts of Provence. <br></p> <p><b> 1 tart pastry base, prepared and cooked as in the fruit and nut tart recipe - reserve any trimmings and use for the lattice </b><br><b> 200g spinach </b><br><b> 125ml milk </b><br><b>125ml whipping cream </b><br><b> 60g caster sugar </b><br><b> 30g raisins </b><br><b> 1/2 vanilla pod </b><br><b> Pinch cinnamon </b><br><b> Pinch nutmeg </b><br><b>Pinch ground allspice </b><br><b> 2 small egg yolks </b><br><b> 30g plain flour </b><br></p> <p>Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Set a pan of water on to boil. Pick through the spinach, discarding the stalks and tarnished leaves. Wash thoroughly, to remove all traces of grit, then put it in a colander and plunge into the boiling water. Remove almost at once, and drain thoroughly: use tongs to move the hot spinach around in the colander, so that as much water as possible drains out. Finally, when it is cool enough to handle, squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water, then lay it out on a tray in a thin layer and chop very finely.</p> <p>Put the raisins in a small saucepan, just cover with boiling water and set to one side. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds, put it all into another small pot, along with the milk and cream, and place over a low heat. Beat the two egg yolks, set aside a spoonful for glazing, then beat in the flour until smooth. Pour in a little of the vanilla cream milk, stirring continuously, and continue thus until all the cream is incorporated. Return the mixture to the cream pot, put back on the heat and stir until thickened and bubbles start bursting on the surface. Remove the vanilla pod, and stir in the chopped spinach, drained raisins and spices.</p> <p>Pour the spinach mix into the prepared tart base. Roll out the pastry trimmings and cut into strips, which you will use to form a lattice over the spinach filling. Glaze the lattice with the reserved egg yolk, add a light sprinkling of sugar, and bake until slightly puffed and a little golden, around 25 minutes. Grigson also suggests placing a small piece of candied peel in each lattice square.</p> <p><b>Cantuccini </b><br></p> <p>This is from Andrea, my pastry chef at Blue Print.

      "bodyText": "Christmas fair bursts with traditions, from little biscuits named for obscure third-century martyrs to 12 flying red-nosed reindeer pulling a sparkly sled spilling over with brightly coloured packages. It seems that even the date of the birth of Christ was chosen to whisk in numerous key days and traditions at once, mainly the winter solstice, the Yule, Saturnalia and the Jewish Feast of Lights. Frankly, Christmas is an exhausting business - and that's before the first glass of Madeira. I would be more than happy to embrace traditions, centuries of them, in fact, if they resembled the opening sequence to the film of Fiddler On The Roof. Watching Topol burst forth singing Tradition with a voice big enough to blow off the dome of St Paul's, then fast-forwarding to the thoroughly splendid bottle dance at that wedding is grand stuff indeed. These days, I am afraid to say that, with damned few exceptions, traditions do less and less for me, especially when they are trundled out for no better reason than \"It's that time of year again\". I tend to wish it wasn't. Of course, the most enduring (and demanding) of all Christmas traditions is the Christmas pudding. It is even more of a tradition than the blessed turkey, and can be a real great, provided the recipe predates the greater part of the Victorian era. The recipes since then are, on the whole, abominable. Eliza Acton's recipe for Christmas pudding is frequently quoted by chefs and food writers as the most authentic - and too true to be good it is, too. However, there are a great many steamed puddings of which I am inordinately fond, and I am quite happy to eat them at any time of year - yes, even this one. Outside the rare slice of fruit cake, dried fruits hardly see the light of day except at Christmas, when we seem to gorge on them as we demolish untold quantities of puddings and pies, cakes and pastries. One memorable Christmas, my Ma really lost the plot and cooked six different cakes, which caused great rebellion followed by much pleading for mercy. Dried fruits - and I mean here the squidgy and yielding kind as opposed to the chippy, insect-like varieties that seem to dry out cakes instead of moistening them - figure greatly in Les Treize Desserts of Provence. This great sequence follows a fish course, frequently the equally indigestible brandade de morue. As fruits on their own terms, raisins and apricots - not to mention almonds, hazelnuts, grapes, nougat, and pears - all feature on the table on Christmas Eve, along with little biscuits and a tart, such as one made with spinach. It's rather reassuring to know that on Christmas Day the gastronomically minded folk of Provence may have something a little simpler to eat, such as turkey stuffed with truffles. I may burn in hell for voicing such heretical ideas with which to round off the Christmas lunch, but my defence is this: memorable meals are worth paying a price for. While I'm at it, I may as well suggest my own preferred close to the festive meal: some freshly cooked pastries, served with just-churned ice cream. Failing that, I'd make up a pretty scene of platters, both flat and pedestalled, piled high with little biscuits and pastries, some of them fine and crisp, others soft and yielding, but all delicious. And don't forget to wash them down with a glass or two of sweet, mellow wine. It may even prove amusing to watch your companions' pleasure at this eminently kinder fin de repas than the traditional pud - although, if truth be told, it will probably not be that much of a relief after everything has been devoured. All recipes serve six. Fruit and nut tart I first ate a tart similar to this in Rome. I have never thought of a suitable name for it, hence the lacklustre appellation. The tart, however, is wonderful. For the pastry 250g plain flour 125g unsalted butter 1 tbsp icing sugar 1 egg 1 tbsp cold water For the filling 100g almonds 30g walnuts 30g hazelnuts 100g unsalted butter 100g caster sugar 2 fresh eggs 30g plain bitter chocolate, broken into pieces Zest of 1 orange 30g raisins 20g sultanas 30ml Marsala Pre-heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. In a bowl, work the butter, flour and icing sugar together until they are the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and water, and knead lightly into a dough. Wrap in clingfilm, and refrigerate for at least an hour. Roughly chop the nuts. Soften the butter and beat with the sugar until pale and creamy. Crack the eggs into a cup and beat with a fork.

Tip the filling into the tart just up to the lip - use any excess in a pie or for biscuits - and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the tart has a gorgeous crust and has taken on a rich hue. Serve with lightly whipped double cream. Ravioli San Giuseppe I love these so much that I have made them every Christmas at Blue Print since leaving Alastair Little, where I first came across them. For the dough 450g flour 140g caster sugar 255g unsalted butter 2 eggs 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest Salt For the filling 1 heaped tsp China tea 12 prunes 675g caster sugar 115g pinenuts 900g Cox's apples Make the dough by putting the flour and sugar into the food processor.

      "body": "<p><strong>In the kitchen</strong><br> Anthony Bourdain</p> <p>The Christmas decorations must have been going up for a while - they can't have just appeared full-blown, but we haven't noticed them until now. We've tried to avoid noticing - they're reminders that, on top of all the other things that Christmas means to us, we have also to buy gifts, see family at some point and pretend that our hearts are filled with holiday cheer, when all we really want to do is beat Santa Claus and all his freaking elves to death with our bare hands and then crawl under the covers for a long, long sleep. </p> <p>The window displays on Fifth Avenue, the giant tree in Rockefeller Center, the skaters and shoppers, the holiday jingles oozing from concealed speakers in lobbies and lifts are annoyances, reminders of the logistical difficulties ahead of us. Santa's not laughing, he's taunting us. That \"Ho, ho, ho\"? It's directed right at us, we're sure of it, in the most Dr Dre and Snoop sense of the word. </p> <p>Since before Thanksgiving, we've been roasting those damned turkeys, hurling them (each about 35lbs) into the ovens, making monstrous vats of cranberry relish, giblet gravy, chestnut stuffing, terrines of foie gras, reductions of goose, sweet potatoes tourn\u00e9ed into football shapes. In kitchens all over New York, chefs look at the long list of scheduled events: the office parties, the holiday menus, the fundraisers, special menus - one long, savage gauntlet of pain, the year's final push. </p> <p>Reservations will double every night from Thanksgiving into late January, our dining rooms will be packed, bars stacked three deep, a mosh pit of revellers waiting for tables. On top of regular service, there will be functions. Every workday a 17-hour holding pattern of geese, ducks, turkeys and hams wait, like circling passenger jets, for room in our ovens. </p> <p>Christmas Eve means that, after work, or sometime during it, my fellow chefs and cooks and I will have to slip out for a few minutes, do some hurried shopping in our food-spattered white uniforms, fully aware of how unlovely we look to the throngs of civilians. We smell no sugarplums, no fir trees, no crackling fire in the hearth, we smell the smoked salmon scent still clinging to our fingers, cold sweat, the lingering odour of our already well-toasted synapses. That smile on our faces is no smile - it's a rictus. And we know that even when Christmas is done, the big event, New Year's Eve, still looms: the ultimate amateur night, when every projectile-vomiting, good-time Charlie in the tri-state area is going to be coming to dinner, paying $300 per person for a gut-busting meal and champagne, after which they'll get loudly and obnoxiously drunk, be over-affectionate with our waitresses and end up relieving themselves in a potted plant.</p> <p>Scrooge, you say? A little over the top with the \"Bah, Humbug\"? It's the restaurant business, cool breeze... and Christmas season for chefs and cooks is the World Series, the Super Bowl and the World Cup all rolled into one. The workdays are longer, the days off fewer and the pace more hectic. It's when everyone on staff, from waiters to bus boys, clings tenuously to sanity, when alcoholics fall off the wagon, coke fiends are tempted to binge, ex-cons compelled to violate their parole and every tragic personal circumstance of every restaurant employee seems destined to come to a head. Ask your waiter for some more bread in a condescending voice? That might be the one little thing that pushes him over the edge from professional serving to senseless butchery. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the period after New Year's Eve is when many sous-chefs go looking for promotion, because that's when so many chefs finally allow themselves that total nervous collapse they've been desperately putting off until the season's over. Jobs become available. </p> <p>Holiday-time, as any New York detective will tell you, is the busy season for murder. And we love, in my kitchen anyway, the inevitable news stories of exchanges of gunfire at family dinners: brother shooting brother over who gets the last slice of breast meat, daughter lunging across the table at Mom with a carving fork as some long-simmering melodrama is played out to the song stylings of Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole, Uncle Joe and Cousin Bob wrestling on the floor among the gift wrappings. Incidents such as these make us feel better about ourselves and our own miserable, dysfunctional lives.</p> <p>On the night itself, we peer through the kitchen doors at our crowded dining rooms - at the happy dining public - and we wonder what it's like to be a civilian, to gather around the tree, to go out with friends, a weekend night, to wish others well over eggnogs and plum pudding. And we look at the fat bastard in the Santa suit outside the window and muse over whether that outfit and false beard are fire-retardant, wanting, in some dark part of our souls, to find out immediately. </p> <p>When Christmas is done, and the kitchen closed, we sit among the rubble - the floor littered with scraps of food and tracked in tinsel - enjoying perhaps a cocktail or two (or four), waiting for the rampaging surge of adrenalin that's sustained us for two months to die down to safety levels. Then, after a few exchanged nods and tight smiles, we drift home to our beds and those silly enough to love us. </p> <p>It's the day after Christmas we enjoy. Our wives or significant others, with any luck, have been to see relatives the night before and hopefully returned with some leftover scraps of overcooked turkey, some lumpy gravy, a few smears of cranberry sauce, a mound of cold stuffing. All across New York, chefs light their morning cigarettes, limp to their living areas, exchange a few hurriedly acquired gifts and sit blissfully on the floor, nibbling a little cold turkey for breakfast, maybe cuddling a loved one. That cold, indifferently prepared turkey tastes delicious. Last night we wouldn't have dreamed of ever eating any, but now, for some reason, it looks good.</p> <p>It's a happy time - the happiest: those few short hours before we set out once again to face the imminent challenge of New Year's Eve. In our pyjamas by the tree, we are children again, our hardened hearts and swollen livers pure, the rage and cynicism which has sustained us since November banished. Now, and only now, it's Christmas.</p> <p><strong>The sacred row</strong><br> Harland Miller</p> <p>The other day, looking in a drawer, I found an aged Christmas card from my older brother Barrington. Inside it said: Dear sibling, here is your decennial Christmas card - please keep it in good condition, your brother, Baz. I blew dust off it and saw that I had, more or less, kept it in the requested state. As for him, he was as good as his word - this year I received a new card to replace the old one.</p> <p> I haven't binned the old one though - just in case. I think the real reason I'm hanging on to it is that, for a long time, it best summed up my own feelings towards Christmas: something to be taken out of a drawer and then put back again until next year. Never the pleasure, always the chore. So, in what you might call the recycling years in between my brother's cards, my feelings towards Christmas were ambivalent. I would spend it just wherever I happened to be at the time. The family house in Yorkshire was too small for all the clans and me; and, besides, I was often living abroad. If people asked my plans, I would concoct false ones, not wanting to embarrass them into taking me in out of pity. In some cultures, though, to refuse hospitality is an insult, so, for this and other reasons (like, when it came down to it, not wanting to get too depressed on my own), I would often find myself at a stranger's hearth side. </p> <p>I once stayed with a family ruled by a despotic dad. When his youngest son at six or seven said something out of turn that caused an embarrassing silence, the lad, fully expecting a thick ear, cowered then became puzzled as his dad abruptly burst out laughing. When his father's assuasive laughter died down, the lad, still confused but with a sudden gleam of hope, blurted out: \"You won't hit me, father, will you, when t' company's gone?\" Anything like this would see me starting to pack. </p> <p>When they said, \"But it's a shame you're leaving\", they might have meant it, but I could already feel repressed tensions percolating to the surface. So much so that, walking briskly down the path, I often felt the urge to cover my head as though the whole house behind me was about to explode: something like what the Hanna-Barbera team might make of the fall of the house of Usher. I have to say, though, that the whole idea of \"not being hit till the company's gone\" is a rueful reminder of a Christmas I spent with Stevo, a friend who had invited me to stay with him and his folks in Berwick. </p> <p>What happened wasn't so much a row brought on by the pressures of Christmas, as a row Christmas presented the opportunity of having - just by dint of all the family being together under one roof at one time. If the ingredients of a Christmas row are, roughly, overspending, overcrowding, over-drinking, then if you consider that these are all, on some basic level, our responses to each other, in a way it all boils down to the same thing really. </p> <p>While I always knew Stevo was gay, I felt sure his family - very traditional Geordies - had no inkling whatsoever. To them, the fact that he never brought a girl home ironically strengthened the regard in which they held his heterosexuality. He was obviously playing the field, a canny lad, our Stephen. And in a house where the status quo was never ruffled beyond a playful jab at the solar plexus, I thought this was probably an ideal set-up. </p> <p>So, while watching telly with the menfolk chauvinistically waiting for the women to cook dinner, I was stunned, kind of horrified, actually, when he whispered to me that he was planning to \"come out\" at the table. And so saying he leant back on the sofa and surreptitiously swallowed what I glimpsed to be a handful of temazepam with his beer. </p> <p>When someone called for a man to come and carve the turkey, Stevo jumped up. I guess he had to do something for his nerves till the temazepam took effect. Everyone else was riveted to Captain Nemo 20,000 leagues under the sea, and as Stevo left the room, temporarily blocking their view of the screen, they bobbed their heads either side of his hips so as not to miss a frame. Someone murmured as though half awakened from a dream: \"Good man, Steve.\" </p> <p>Sitting down to eat, I remember not being able to make much of a fist of pulling crackers and thinking, is this right? But there was no further opportunity to dissuade him and, anyway, I'm glad now that I didn't - I'd probably have said something like, \"Are you sure you want to do this now?\" (ie, while I'm here). He told me later (as I tended his eye in the cab) that it wouldn't have done any good because he was absolutely dead set - he'd planned it this way all along, which is why he'd taken me and the temazepam up there in the first place. </p> <p> About halfway into the main course, the conversation - which up till then had been exclusively about Newcastle United and what a player Peter Beardsley was - gave way to the serious business of eating, the sounds of appreciative mastication and the B&amp;B-style scrape of cutlery on crockery. Every now and then, out of this, someone would rest their fork for a while and, shaking their head, sort of sigh in that lilting Geordie, \"Eeeyah, that Peetah Beardslee.\" This last seemed to touch off an activating impulse in Stevo. Noisily, he shoved back his chair from the table and tugged off his napkin in such a manner as to get everyone's attention. After an epidemic of head-turning in his direction, he cleared his throat. The temazepam had given him a slight distance through which he seemed connected to us only by the pressure his fingertips were exerting on the table edge. </p> <p>Although my senses were sort of stultified by anxiety now, they still noted keenly how the enquiring eyes of his family looked oddly out from under their paper hats. Stevo's own eyes were quite glazed as he said, \"I've somethin' to say... to tell you,\" he faltered. There was a silent kind of \"Well, don't keep us in suspense, son\", into which he said - growing into the conviction he'd rehearsed - \"I... am gay.\" </p> <p> If I'd been writing a script for black comedy about homophobia and general intolerance of homosexuality in northern Britain today, I'd have ruled out what followed next as too stereotypical, just too over the top. What I remember most was that after a stunned second or two - not waiting to see what Stevo's dad had to say about it - his mum's brother, who was nearest anyway, got up and punched him. </p> <p>Looking back, I realised that Stevo's idea wasn't to ruin Christmas. Ironically, he was acting out of some half-forgotten family credo along the lines of: \"If you've got something to say, let's best all hear it now!\" Christmas is a time for sharing, they say. But if, like me, you've ever wondered what it would take to be told, \"You've ruined everything\", but were only able to imagine acts of juvenile crassness at a church wedding, or causing the family name to appear in a tabloid expos\u00e9, then consider sharing something with the family that you think they might all benefit from knowing. Alternatively, put it in a drawer until next year.</p> <p><strong>The decorations </strong><br> Trezza Azzopardi</p> <p> Right. It's going to be a Dickensian Christmas in this house. And no complaining. We weren't: it's hard to complain when you're speechless. We eyed the two canisters our mother held up in front of us as if they were hand grenades with their pins pulled. It wasn't just going to be a Dickensian Christmas, it was also going to be a White Dickensian Christmas. The cans were decorated on the outside with snowflakes, like a gang of miniature doilies linking arms. On the inside, she told us, there was real snow.</p> <p>I argued with my sisters over who was going to do the snowing. It's a hazard to life and limb, this. I'll do it, and you lot can put up the trimmings. The horrible trimmings. We'd rather have a fight over whose turn it was to hose down the chicken run. Putting up the Christmas decorations is supposed to be a fun thing for children, in a soft-focus glossy magazine candlelight and velveteen knickerbocker sort of way, but this was the 70s, a time when trimmings did exactly what they said on the packet: they trimmed.</p> <p>Our \"centrepiece\" was a two-dimensional paper bell that would, when unclipped, magically unfurl into... a three-dimensional paper bell. We had it hanging (hanging was too good for it) every Christmas from the light fitting in the centre of the room, where it rocked in the draft from the fire, where it was head-butted every time my father rose from his chair to switch channels on the telly.</p> <p>Actually, it wasn't a task entirely without pleasure. Baubling and deconcertinanation (the art of flicking the flat-pack streamers out in front of you so that they'd spring across the room like a greyhound from a trap) provided entertainment; the sound the new one made (to replace the one that had been broken beyond repair during the previous year's de-trimming) snapped like cutting a new pack of cards. Then there was the game of deciphering the shapes they made: Ten lords a-leaping? Twelve blobs a-blobbing? This would be quickly followed by a lot of standing on and falling off chairs in an effort to reach into the corners of the picture-rail: Three girls a-falling and a Tin-tack Embedded in your Knee.</p> <p>By the time the tree came out from on top of the wardrobe and the fairy had been rescued from the attentions of the dog, we had Five girls a-sulking and the last one in casu-alty (for a tetanus booster). I didn't need to put on my crying act - or point out that I was the youngest - to get my mother to hand over the snow-cans, especially as she had more difficult work to do, such as emptying the shed in preparation for the 18lb turkey she'd ordered from the butcher sometime back in July.</p> <p>The theme \"Dickensian Christmas\" suggested to me no less than the breathless spectacle of having Mark Lester sitting at the end of the bed singing Where Is Love? while Victorian nannies in lace-trimmed uniforms capered down our street bouncing their prams and asking who would buy this beautiful morning. With The Little Baby Jesus and Tiny Tim enjoying a hearty breakfast in our kitchen, and Val Doonican popping in for a singsong wearing the sweater my mother knitted him, the fantasy would be complete.</p> <p>My mother's idea of a Dickensian Christmas began and ended with a bit of spray-snow on the windows. A flourish of crescent in each corner was all that was required: One girl a-spraying and the result looked very dull indeed. So I moved on, to the glass panes in the front door, then the windows on the chicken coop, so that they, too, could enjoy the spirit of Dickens (and be spared the sight of one of their kin naked and bound in the shed).</p> <p>I snowed the bottom left-hand corner of the telly in the hope that, when the Queen looked in on us, she'd see we were having a Proper Dickensian Christmas, like the best of her loyal subjects. I snowed the fish tank. I snowed my boots. Up in the bedrooms, I snowed the headboards and the dressing table, Kate's Donny Osmond posters and Sally's framed photograph of herself as a bridesmaid. (I was becoming experimental by now, branching out into the human form, doing eyebrows and beards and moustaches.) I snowed my Space Hopper and put it on the front lawn, where it sat like a malevolent snow-gnome. I snowed my father's spectacles: if he peered through the storm, he might just have seen the magnificent snow-job I'd done on the dog. Reverse Dalmatian - all the rage in Dickensian times, and quite the thing round ours.</p>",

We'd rather have a fight over whose turn it was to hose down the chicken run. Putting up the Christmas decorations is supposed to be a fun thing for children, in a soft-focus glossy magazine candlelight and velveteen knickerbocker sort of way, but this was the 70s, a time when trimmings did exactly what they said on the packet: they trimmed. Our \"centrepiece\" was a two-dimensional paper bell that would, when unclipped, magically unfurl into... a three-dimensional paper bell. We had it hanging (hanging was too good for it) every Christmas from the light fitting in the centre of the room, where it rocked in the draft from the fire, where it was head-butted every time my father rose from his chair to switch channels on the telly. Actually, it wasn't a task entirely without pleasure. Baubling and deconcertinanation (the art of flicking the flat-pack streamers out in front of you so that they'd spring across the room like a greyhound from a trap) provided entertainment; the sound the new one made (to replace the one that had been broken beyond repair during the previous year's de-trimming) snapped like cutting a new pack of cards. Then there was the game of deciphering the shapes they made: Ten lords a-leaping? Twelve blobs a-blobbing? This would be quickly followed by a lot of standing on and falling off chairs in an effort to reach into the corners of the picture-rail: Three girls a-falling and a Tin-tack Embedded in your Knee. By the time the tree came out from on top of the wardrobe and the fairy had been rescued from the attentions of the dog, we had Five girls a-sulking and the last one in casu-alty (for a tetanus booster). I didn't need to put on my crying act - or point out that I was the youngest - to get my mother to hand over the snow-cans, especially as she had more difficult work to do, such as emptying the shed in preparation for the 18lb turkey she'd ordered from the butcher sometime back in July. The theme \"Dickensian Christmas\" suggested to me no less than the breathless spectacle of having Mark Lester sitting at the end of the bed singing Where Is Love? while Victorian nannies in lace-trimmed uniforms capered down our street bouncing their prams and asking who would buy this beautiful morning. With The Little Baby Jesus and Tiny Tim enjoying a hearty breakfast in our kitchen, and Val Doonican popping in for a singsong wearing the sweater my mother knitted him, the fantasy would be complete. My mother's idea of a Dickensian Christmas began and ended with a bit of spray-snow on the windows. A flourish of crescent in each corner was all that was required: One girl a-spraying and the result looked very dull indeed. So I moved on, to the glass panes in the front door, then the windows on the chicken coop, so that they, too, could enjoy the spirit of Dickens (and be spared the sight of one of their kin naked and bound in the shed). I snowed the bottom left-hand corner of the telly in the hope that, when the Queen looked in on us, she'd see we were having a Proper Dickensian Christmas, like the best of her loyal subjects. I snowed the fish tank. I snowed my boots. Up in the bedrooms, I snowed the headboards and the dressing table, Kate's Donny Osmond posters and Sally's framed photograph of herself as a bridesmaid. (I was becoming experimental by now, branching out into the human form, doing eyebrows and beards and moustaches.) I snowed my Space Hopper and put it on the front lawn, where it sat like a malevolent snow-gnome. I snowed my father's spectacles: if he peered through the storm, he might just have seen the magnificent snow-job I'd done on the dog. Reverse Dalmatian - all the rage in Dickensian times, and quite the thing round ours.",

      "body": "<p><strong>The Tree</strong><br> Anna Davis</p> <p>December 1978 (age seven)</p> <p> I want an artificial Christmas tree like the one Nicola's family have - all pink and sparkly instead of boring green. Nicola even has a mini version in her bedroom. Mum and Dad just say, \"We're not Nicola's family\" - which is the line they use about everything I suggest: deep-pile carpets, tortoises, TV cabinets and cup-cakes with Disney characters on the top, to name but a few. </p> <p>Not only that, but I have to wait until the last Sunday before Christmas for the tree actually to go up. Nicola's trees go up at the beginning of December! Mum says if we put the tree up earlier it will be dropping needles by Christmas Day. Well, the answer to that is obvious, isn't it? An artificial tree... </p> <p> Finally, the day has come for the tree to go up. I have to admit, it's great - goes almost up to the ceiling (much bigger than Nicola's). Dad gets the decorations down from the loft and takes ages to untangle the lights. Mum is in charge of the tinsel, and she's really fussy about how to arrange it. </p> <p>We have to wait until they're done before we can start hanging things, and my four-year-old brother, Rhidian, starts going apeshit because they're taking so long. We have a great selection of decorations. My favourites are the fat plastic Santa, the furry snowman and the glittery sparkly things that look like exploding fireworks. Rhidian is being a nightmare about which things he gets to hang - basically all the good stuff - but it's easy to trick him. I tell him I want to hang all the crappy flat wooden decorations that Mum and Dad got in Germany. Sure enough, he now wants to hang them, leaving me with the best ones - ha! </p> <p>Mum disappears and comes back with a new angel to go on top of the tree. Hey, wait a second, that's no angel. That's my doll, Dawn - she's a Pippa doll really, but I call her Dawn. She's been missing for ages, and now I know why. Mum has dressed her up in a homemade white frock and tinfoil wings. I'm speechless with rage. But when Dad puts her on the tree, my anger disappears. She looks kind of beautiful with her golden hair and her new angel clothes. Dad switches the lights on, and the tree is magic.</p> <p>December 1980 (age nine)</p> <p>I cannot believe it. This year's tree is tiny. It's so small that Dad has to put it on the sideboard. It doesn't reach anywhere near the ceiling. When I start to protest, Mum and Dad get snappy. </p> <p> Rhidian is on my side, for once, but his method of protest - foot-stamping and screaming - is not helping much. Mum insists that the tree is no smaller than usual - it's just that I'm bigger. She says that we always put the tree on the sideboard, but this is a bare-faced lie. I fetch the photo album to prove my point. Sure enough, last year and the year before, the tree clearly sits on the floor and stretches right up to the ceiling. </p> <p>But Mum will not admit defeat: she says that when we lived in the bungalow years ago, she would find a branch in the park, put it in a pot and spray it silver - and that would be our tree! The only decorations we had then were the crappy wooden ones from Germany. She looks all dreamy when she tells the story. I say I don't remember any stupid branch, and then Dad tells me I'm a spoilt brat and I'd better shut up or there'll be no Christmas tree at all.</p> <p>The good news - well, there has to be some, doesn't there - is that Mum has bought five gorgeous glass baubles to go on the tree. And Dad has recorded the King's College Choir singing carols, so we listen to the tape while we decorate the tree. I start feeling happier.</p> <p>It's not long, though, before Rhidian is throwing a tantrum because Mum won't let him hang the glass baubles. She says that he'll break them. He says he won't. In the end she gives in and lets him hang one. He breaks it.</p> <p>December 1982 (age 11) </p> <p>I have a stomach bug. I was up all night being sick and now I'm lying on the sofa, pale and weak, listening to the King's College Choir carol tape. Mum is away in Cardiff, working. Dad is in the kitchen cooking curry (the smell makes me want to chunder). This leaves only Rhidian to decorate the tree.</p> <p>I lie there, watching him, feeling teary. I would have thought he'd be smug about getting to do the tree all by himself, but he's not. He keeps asking my advice about where the various decorations should go. In fact, we both know that Mum will move them all around when she gets back tomorrow - she's like that.</p> <p>Dawn comes out of the box covered in red spots like the measles. I think she was lying too close to the red tree candles - we should throw those candles out. We never use them, anyway, because Dad thinks the tree might catch fire. Dad comes in to tell us that Mum just phoned and that she's gone down with the stomach bug.</p> <p>December 1983 (age 12) </p> <p>Mum has dragged in the biggest tree that I've ever seen. It's so huge she has to saw the top off with a bread knife just to get it into the room. Rhidian and I can see right through this charade. Does Mum really think that giving us a monster tree will compensate for the fact that we have to live in a poxy flat in poxy Cardiff? She's so pathetic. No wonder Dad left her. Christmas is going to be the pits this year.</p> <p>December 1985 (age 14)</p> <p> Why is it that just when things begin to get better, something always has to come along and spoil it all . . . We've got used to Christmases sans-Dad now.</p> <p>It's okay just being the three of us. So why must we have bloody Grandma to stay for Christmas? She's such an old bag. She even offered to bring her ancient artificial tree with her - oh, please.</p> <p>Mum's too busy trying to get the tree (a real one, thank Christ) straight in its stand to see what Rhidian is doing behind Grandma's back. I'm trying not to laugh. When we open the decorations box, three huge wasps come flying out and start dive-bombing us. Mum kills them with needle fixative spray while Grandma hides behind an armchair.</p> <p>December 1990 (age 19)</p> <p>Rhidian and I buy the tree from the greengrocer's down the road and drag it back to the house together. Mum is lying on the sofa, resting. She opens her eyes when we come in and compliments us on having chosen such a pretty one. </p> <p>She watches while we hang the decorations. Sometimes she's awake, sometimes she's sleeping. I'm trying not to get upset. You've got to look on the bright side - at least Grandma's not here. Mum's not strong enough to put up with her this year. In a weird way, this is reminding me of that year when I had the stomach bug and Rhidian decorated the tree on his own. But it's not like that, is it?</p> <p>December 1991 (age 20) </p> <p>Dad has a surprise for us: it's our box of decorations - I didn't know he'd brought them here to Saffron Walden - I thought they were still in the loft in Cardiff. I never thought I'd be so pleased to see those crappy German wooden things. Poor old Dawn looks like she has bubonic plague. I try to clean her up while Dad and Rhidian hang the lights on the tree - new ones, plain white bulbs rather than coloured - very chic. Dad's partner, Fran\u00e7oise, puts on the old King's College Choir tape and we drink a sherry toast to Mum.</p> <p>December 1999 (age 28)</p> <p>I told Simon he'd be able to join in the Davis family tree decorating ritual, but when we arrive at Dad's place the tree is already up. Apparently, they put it up at the beginning of December! Fran\u00e7oise explains that they thought it would be nice for Florence (their five-year-old daughter) if the tree went up early. Anyway, says Dad, the trees are a different sort now. They have thicker needles that don't fall off. I tell him I prefer the old trees - these new ones don't smell of anything.</p> <p>They've made a reasonable job of the tree, but there's something not quite right about it. After everyone's gone to bed, Rhidian and I move some of the decorations around. Simon finds this very amusing.</p> <p><strong>A Christmas in London</strong><br> Diana Athill</p> <p>For years, it never occurred to me not to go home to Norfolk for Christmas. While the sparkle of childhood Christmases still hovered in the air, I loved doing so; but by the mid-50s, when I'd been working in London for six years, habit had taken over. It was not that I didn't love my family, but our Christmases had become slightly oppressive because, although they were now not much different from any ordinary weekend, we all worked so hard to make them \"special\". So, as I trotted off to Liverpool Street station (not then the most invigorating point of departure), I used to suffer sharp pangs of envy for all those people who were able to stay in London. And the more sober our Christmases became, the more glittery became my image of what those lucky people got up to. </p> <p>Then came a year when the author Brian Moore and his then wife, Jacky, wintered in London. We saw a lot of each other, had great fun - and a wild idea seized me: I would stay in London for Christmas! At last I would join in the delicious festivity of Christmas in the capital and give a Christmas Day party for the Moores.</p> <p>Having steeled myself to break the news to my parents, who took it sadly but bravely, I called the Moores. \"Oh misery!\" said Jacky. \"We've just booked ourselves 10 days in Paris over Christmas.\" After which I learned, in a dismal crescendo of disappointment, that all the other people on my party list were also going away - one couple skiing, one to the West Indies, but most were doing what I had done for so long myself: \"Going home for Christmas.\" The only people I knew who were staying in London were an old friend and her new husband, who had decided to devote the holiday to decorating their new flat. \"Oh, poor, poor you,\" she said. \"You must come and have supper with us - if you don't mind something very scrappy, because I think we'll still only have a gas ring.\"</p> <p>Only then did I learn that on Christmas Day in London there were no buses and no underground. Minicabs didn't yet exist. If you wanted a taxi, you telephoned, believe it or not, a cab rank. I must have telephoned every rank in west London: no one answered. So I walked from St John's Wood to Sloane Square, and back again after our modest collation, and on both walks the solitary figures I saw from time to time flitting along the silent streets could have been counted on my fingers and toes. Every now and then, there was a door with a wreath of holly on it, and on two occasions a window had its curtains far enough apart to reveal a glimpse of a Christmas tree.</p> <p>Wow - Christmas in London!</p> <p>The next morning, I caught Boxing Day's only train to Norwich, and that evening a glass of sherry before dinner with my parents seemed like reckless gaiety.</p> <p><strong>The art of giving</strong><br> David Stafford</p> <p>If you haven't yet got round to doing any Christmas shopping for your loved ones, or if you tried to but found yourself bursting into tears every time you went in a shop because the people were too many, too tall and too rough, or if you've just discovered that the rare and expensive gifts you bought from an unlicensed Big Issue salesman by the name of Faulty Tony smell too much of nappy play-do to be genuine Gucci, then stay tuned. Salvation is coming up - right after this story. </p> <p>It is Christmas. Josh gets Miriam a bottle of Happy, the new perfume by Clinique. Miriam gets Josh a boxed set of videos by the acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa. Both open their presents with every appearance of delight, but immediately the creeping doubts move in. </p> <p>Though Miriam has known Josh for many years, she has never had him pegged as the sort of man who buys perfume for women. Why does he start now? Has another woman put the suggestion there? Who is this other woman, and how has she gained such influence over him that she can dictate what he buys his wife for Christmas? And why Happy? Does he know of some reason why she should be unhappy - the other woman, for instance - and offers the perfume as a substitute for the real happiness she once thought she had found? </p> <p>Meanwhile, Josh examines the Japanese videos, his eyes bright with pleasure. He is dumbfounded. He has never expressed any interest in foreign cinema, and once remembers mentioning that he couldn't abide sushi. Is the gift, then, intended as a message of hatred? Or worse, is Miriam trying to extend his intellectual horizons, to improve him, implying that he is a cultural dwarf? Just who the hell does she think she is, anyway? These are petty, ungrateful thoughts, unworthy of big-hearted people, so they stifle them. </p> <p>By mid-January, the gifts have long been forgotten, but the unspoken thoughts have hardened into deep-seated shards of resentment. By March, Josh and Miriam are fighting with knives. By April, Josh is dead, and the judge is thinking, \"Why did we stop at Ruth Ellis?\" </p> <p>Josh had bought the perfume because he had six minutes to do his Christmas shopping. The perfume department was on the ground floor of the department store. Clinique had the smallest queues. Miriam had bought the Kurosawa videos because she had overheard Josh telling Keith, a friend he liked to impress, that he was crazy about Japanese cinema. Josh was, of course, inhumanly drunk at the time. Also, they were on special offer at Our Price. </p> <p>Giving or receiving, either way it's packed with crap. Too much symbolism. I blame myrrh. The Wise Man only got it because it was on a twofer in the Everything-Under-A-Pound Shop essential oils collection. Next thing he stood accused of predicting an agonising death for the Littul Baby Jesus and wishing he'd got Babygros instead. And if he'd got Babygros, what then? Gold, frankincense and Babygros. He'd go down in history not as the Wise Man, but as the Unimaginative Man With No Sense of Occasion. You can't win. With the onrush of consumer capitalism, the most mundane objects have become endowed with talismanic significance at the best of times, and Christmas is the worst of times. Slippers say you're old. Teccie says you're fly. Alternative health cack says you're dippy. Anything hobby- or sport-related says dickhead. And don't get me started on CDs, books and videos. One Christmas, an ex-wife gave me not one but two books about polar bears. I'm still reeling. </p> <p>And this is where cash comes in. Cash is giving at its purest and cleanest, free of the taint of symbolism or side. Admittedly, giving cash has a reputation for vulgarity, but only among the vulgar. Catherine Zeta-Jones asked for cash instead of wedding presents, and vulgarity was ever a stranger to the Welsh. If cash says anything, it says \"honest\". It speaks volumes of both the giver's and the receiver's admirable disregard for glib sophistication, their ennui with the \"it's the thought that counts\" lie, their espousal of an open-handed, heartfelt sincerity.</p> <p>Think how bucked you felt the last time you found a forgotten fiver in the pocket of an old jacket. Think how much more bucked you'd have been if that fiver had been gift-wrapped. Nothing says \"I love you\" better than 58 quid. Forty-three says, \"You're a very special mum.\" Fifteen ninety-five is a passport to Pok\u00e9mon heaven. And if you really want to see the lady's face light up, bin the Terry's All Gold and fill the box with twenties. If you screw them up in a fun and festive way, rather than leaving them flat, it won't set you back more than a three or four hundred. </p> <p>This, by the way, is the salvation I promised. If you've left your shopping too late, or just bollocksed it, nip down the cash machine, pick out the freshest notes, and wrap them up pretty. Include a copy of this article to prove that giving cash is all the rage, the in thing to do - \"I read it in the paper. Look, I clipped the thing out to prove it.\" And you're home and dry. I hope so, anyway.</p> <p><strong>The cake</strong><br> Stella Duffy</p> <p>I make my own Christmas cake. Every year. And I make mincemeat for mince pies, and even pastry, when it comes to it, if I'm feeling really virtuous. Christmas puddings are homemade - definitely. The shop ones don't have nearly enough brandy for my taste. Or fruit. Or rum. </p> <p>Making my own Christmas cake is necessary - I don't like dark fruit cakes, but I do like the recipe (Delia's Creole Christmas Cake with Stella's extra alcohol), and so do most people who eat it. </p> <p>Making Christmas cake is more than just allowing the Nigella \"domestic goddess\" to flow through me, although that is certainly part of it - it is recalling my mother who worked full-time and still seemed to be baking scones, pikelets and cakes most Saturday mornings. It is pretending I now live in a nuclear family (though I wasn't brought up in one and won't be having one of my own). It is generally making believe that Christmas is fairy-tale land and we can all live happily ever after. Planning and making and organising weeks beforehand, so that when the day comes it will all work out. </p> <p>And maybe this year I will get the turkey done on time, and not need to add an extra hour to the cooking (no matter what I do, that's how long it always takes). And I don't even like turkey. Never have. </p> <p>Baking my own Christmas cake involves starting in November - it makes the glowering skies and the rain falling down outside worthwhile: a warm kitchen and hot spice aromas filling the hallway. The late afternoon darkness makes sense of all those Christmas cakes that I stirred wishes into as a child while the sun shone outside and the New Zealand summer asserted its independence from not-very-definite spring, in a land too muggy and often far too wet-hot for the steaming turkey and sprouts placed before us. Meanwhile, my mother would try to re-create \"home\" for both herself and her uninspired offspring. </p> <p>There is a part of me that would love not to bother. Not to have the tree and the attendant mess and the lights that fail after the second week. Not to get caught up in the desire to buy far more than I need; cook more than will be eaten; drink earlier than is seemly, even in my own home. </p> <p>Every year I think that maybe we could do minimalist Christmas this year. Just one carefully bought present. Food that we really want instead of tradition-dictated. Only a very good champagne instead of half a dozen cocktails and no end in sight before the new year. It's a part of me I listen to - and then ignore.</p> <p>Because the kid Stella always wins out. Wants the magpie nest of lights, the candles, the shiny paper and even shinier ribbons. Loves the look and the smell of Christmas, even if she isn't all that fond of the taste. And wants to make Christmas cake, to make the wishes, and to see my own hands become my mother's hands on a heavy wooden spoon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bestof2000/story/0,6194,414970,00.html\">Read the part two of 'The spirit of Christmas' here</a></p>",

Mum's too busy trying to get the tree (a real one, thank Christ) straight in its stand to see what Rhidian is doing behind Grandma's back. I'm trying not to laugh. When we open the decorations box, three huge wasps come flying out and start dive-bombing us. Mum kills them with needle fixative spray while Grandma hides behind an armchair. December 1990 (age 19) Rhidian and I buy the tree from the greengrocer's down the road and drag it back to the house together. Mum is lying on the sofa, resting. She opens her eyes when we come in and compliments us on having chosen such a pretty one. She watches while we hang the decorations. Sometimes she's awake, sometimes she's sleeping. I'm trying not to get upset. You've got to look on the bright side - at least Grandma's not here. Mum's not strong enough to put up with her this year. In a weird way, this is reminding me of that year when I had the stomach bug and Rhidian decorated the tree on his own. But it's not like that, is it? December 1991 (age 20) Dad has a surprise for us: it's our box of decorations - I didn't know he'd brought them here to Saffron Walden - I thought they were still in the loft in Cardiff. I never thought I'd be so pleased to see those crappy German wooden things. Poor old Dawn looks like she has bubonic plague. I try to clean her up while Dad and Rhidian hang the lights on the tree - new ones, plain white bulbs rather than coloured - very chic. Dad's partner, Fran\u00e7oise, puts on the old King's College Choir tape and we drink a sherry toast to Mum. December 1999 (age 28) I told Simon he'd be able to join in the Davis family tree decorating ritual, but when we arrive at Dad's place the tree is already up. Apparently, they put it up at the beginning of December! Fran\u00e7oise explains that they thought it would be nice for Florence (their five-year-old daughter) if the tree went up early. Anyway, says Dad, the trees are a different sort now. They have thicker needles that don't fall off. I tell him I prefer the old trees - these new ones don't smell of anything. They've made a reasonable job of the tree, but there's something not quite right about it. After everyone's gone to bed, Rhidian and I move some of the decorations around. Simon finds this very amusing. A Christmas in London Diana Athill For years, it never occurred to me not to go home to Norfolk for Christmas. While the sparkle of childhood Christmases still hovered in the air, I loved doing so; but by the mid-50s, when I'd been working in London for six years, habit had taken over. It was not that I didn't love my family, but our Christmases had become slightly oppressive because, although they were now not much different from any ordinary weekend, we all worked so hard to make them \"special\". So, as I trotted off to Liverpool Street station (not then the most invigorating point of departure), I used to suffer sharp pangs of envy for all those people who were able to stay in London. And the more sober our Christmases became, the more glittery became my image of what those lucky people got up to. Then came a year when the author Brian Moore and his then wife, Jacky, wintered in London. We saw a lot of each other, had great fun - and a wild idea seized me: I would stay in London for Christmas! At last I would join in the delicious festivity of Christmas in the capital and give a Christmas Day party for the Moores. Having steeled myself to break the news to my parents, who took it sadly but bravely, I called the Moores. \"Oh misery!\" said Jacky. \"We've just booked ourselves 10 days in Paris over Christmas.\" After which I learned, in a dismal crescendo of disappointment, that all the other people on my party list were also going away - one couple skiing, one to the West Indies, but most were doing what I had done for so long myself: \"Going home for Christmas.\" The only people I knew who were staying in London were an old friend and her new husband, who had decided to devote the holiday to decorating their new flat. \"Oh, poor, poor you,\" she said. \"You must come and have supper with us - if you don't mind something very scrappy, because I think we'll still only have a gas ring.\" Only then did I learn that on Christmas Day in London there were no buses and no underground. Minicabs didn't yet exist. If you wanted a taxi, you telephoned, believe it or not, a cab rank. I must have telephoned every rank in west London: no one answered. So I walked from St John's Wood to Sloane Square, and back again after our modest collation, and on both walks the solitary figures I saw from time to time flitting along the silent streets could have been counted on my fingers and toes. Every now and then, there was a door with a wreath of holly on it, and on two occasions a window had its curtains far enough apart to reveal a glimpse of a Christmas tree. Wow - Christmas in London! The next morning, I caught Boxing Day's only train to Norwich, and that evening a glass of sherry before dinner with my parents seemed like reckless gaiety. The art of giving David Stafford If you haven't yet got round to doing any Christmas shopping for your loved ones, or if you tried to but found yourself bursting into tears every time you went in a shop because the people were too many, too tall and too rough, or if you've just discovered that the rare and expensive gifts you bought from an unlicensed Big Issue salesman by the name of Faulty Tony smell too much of nappy play-do to be genuine Gucci, then stay tuned. Salvation is coming up - right after this story. It is Christmas. Josh gets Miriam a bottle of Happy, the new perfume by Clinique. Miriam gets Josh a boxed set of videos by the acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa. Both open their presents with every appearance of delight, but immediately the creeping doubts move in. Though Miriam has known Josh for many years, she has never had him pegged as the sort of man who buys perfume for women. Why does he start now? Has another woman put the suggestion there? Who is this other woman, and how has she gained such influence over him that she can dictate what he buys his wife for Christmas? And why Happy? Does he know of some reason why she should be unhappy - the other woman, for instance - and offers the perfume as a substitute for the real happiness she once thought she had found? Meanwhile, Josh examines the Japanese videos, his eyes bright with pleasure. He is dumbfounded. He has never expressed any interest in foreign cinema, and once remembers mentioning that he couldn't abide sushi. Is the gift, then, intended as a message of hatred? Or worse, is Miriam trying to extend his intellectual horizons, to improve him, implying that he is a cultural dwarf? Just who the hell does she think she is, anyway? These are petty, ungrateful thoughts, unworthy of big-hearted people, so they stifle them. By mid-January, the gifts have long been forgotten, but the unspoken thoughts have hardened into deep-seated shards of resentment. By March, Josh and Miriam are fighting with knives. By April, Josh is dead, and the judge is thinking, \"Why did we stop at Ruth Ellis?\" Josh had bought the perfume because he had six minutes to do his Christmas shopping. The perfume department was on the ground floor of the department store. Clinique had the smallest queues. Miriam had bought the Kurosawa videos because she had overheard Josh telling Keith, a friend he liked to impress, that he was crazy about Japanese cinema. Josh was, of course, inhumanly drunk at the time. Also, they were on special offer at Our Price. Giving or receiving, either way it's packed with crap. Too much symbolism. I blame myrrh. The Wise Man only got it because it was on a twofer in the Everything-Under-A-Pound Shop essential oils collection. Next thing he stood accused of predicting an agonising death for the Littul Baby Jesus and wishing he'd got Babygros instead. And if he'd got Babygros, what then? Gold, frankincense and Babygros. He'd go down in history not as the Wise Man, but as the Unimaginative Man With No Sense of Occasion. You can't win. With the onrush of consumer capitalism, the most mundane objects have become endowed with talismanic significance at the best of times, and Christmas is the worst of times. Slippers say you're old. Teccie says you're fly. Alternative health cack says you're dippy. Anything hobby- or sport-related says dickhead. And don't get me started on CDs, books and videos. One Christmas, an ex-wife gave me not one but two books about polar bears. I'm still reeling. And this is where cash comes in. Cash is giving at its purest and cleanest, free of the taint of symbolism or side. Admittedly, giving cash has a reputation for vulgarity, but only among the vulgar. Catherine Zeta-Jones asked for cash instead of wedding presents, and vulgarity was ever a stranger to the Welsh. If cash says anything, it says \"honest\". It speaks volumes of both the giver's and the receiver's admirable disregard for glib sophistication, their ennui with the \"it's the thought that counts\" lie, their espousal of an open-handed, heartfelt sincerity. Think how bucked you felt the last time you found a forgotten fiver in the pocket of an old jacket. Think how much more bucked you'd have been if that fiver had been gift-wrapped. Nothing says \"I love you\" better than 58 quid. Forty-three says, \"You're a very special mum.\" Fifteen ninety-five is a passport to Pok\u00e9mon heaven. And if you really want to see the lady's face light up, bin the Terry's All Gold and fill the box with twenties. If you screw them up in a fun and festive way, rather than leaving them flat, it won't set you back more than a three or four hundred. This, by the way, is the salvation I promised. If you've left your shopping too late, or just bollocksed it, nip down the cash machine, pick out the freshest notes, and wrap them up pretty. Include a copy of this article to prove that giving cash is all the rage, the in thing to do - \"I read it in the paper. Look, I clipped the thing out to prove it.\" And you're home and dry. I hope so, anyway. The cake Stella Duffy I make my own Christmas cake. Every year. And I make mincemeat for mince pies, and even pastry, when it comes to it, if I'm feeling really virtuous. Christmas puddings are homemade - definitely. The shop ones don't have nearly enough brandy for my taste. Or fruit. Or rum. Making my own Christmas cake is necessary - I don't like dark fruit cakes, but I do like the recipe (Delia's Creole Christmas Cake with Stella's extra alcohol), and so do most people who eat it. Making Christmas cake is more than just allowing the Nigella \"domestic goddess\" to flow through me, although that is certainly part of it - it is recalling my mother who worked full-time and still seemed to be baking scones, pikelets and cakes most Saturday mornings. It is pretending I now live in a nuclear family (though I wasn't brought up in one and won't be having one of my own). It is generally making believe that Christmas is fairy-tale land and we can all live happily ever after. Planning and making and organising weeks beforehand, so that when the day comes it will all work out. And maybe this year I will get the turkey done on time, and not need to add an extra hour to the cooking (no matter what I do, that's how long it always takes). And I don't even like turkey. Never have. Baking my own Christmas cake involves starting in November - it makes the glowering skies and the rain falling down outside worthwhile: a warm kitchen and hot spice aromas filling the hallway. The late afternoon darkness makes sense of all those Christmas cakes that I stirred wishes into as a child while the sun shone outside and the New Zealand summer asserted its independence from not-very-definite spring, in a land too muggy and often far too wet-hot for the steaming turkey and sprouts placed before us. Meanwhile, my mother would try to re-create \"home\" for both herself and her uninspired offspring. There is a part of me that would love not to bother. Not to have the tree and the attendant mess and the lights that fail after the second week. Not to get caught up in the desire to buy far more than I need; cook more than will be eaten; drink earlier than is seemly, even in my own home. Every year I think that maybe we could do minimalist Christmas this year. Just one carefully bought present. Food that we really want instead of tradition-dictated. Only a very good champagne instead of half a dozen cocktails and no end in sight before the new year. It's a part of me I listen to - and then ignore. Because the kid Stella always wins out. Wants the magpie nest of lights, the candles, the shiny paper and even shinier ribbons. Loves the look and the smell of Christmas, even if she isn't all that fond of the taste. And wants to make Christmas cake, to make the wishes, and to see my own hands become my mother's hands on a heavy wooden spoon. Read the part two of 'The spirit of Christmas' here",

An allied consideration is that a recipient can come to feel resentment towards the donor, whether or not his belief that the gift concealed a hook is true. Givers feel better disposed towards receivers than vice versa; it is charming and warming to give, for not much can adulterate the self-satisfaction involved - except of course ill-graced ingratitude or even mere indifference on the receiver's part.

Burrell has been as loyal and devoted a friend to the Princess since her death as he was during her life, and I'm sure what he wrote - \"What would the Royals buy for Christmas?\" - was intended to be a soft-focus, sepia-tinted glimpse of a much-missed fascinator at a nostalgic time of year.</p> <p>I must say, though, that, in the picture it painted of the deluxe isolation of the Windsors, and especially of the vulnerable and fragile girl who became their brood mare par excellence, I found this romp through the royal wish-list easily as chilling as any treacherous Highgrove phone conversation transcript or bland Buck Pal message of sympathy. With the media currently wetting itself over Prince William, it wouldn't hurt for a minute to remember his mother, without whom he wouldn't have ended up looking like that. Not with Camilla Parker Bowles as a mum. </p> <p>Each Christmas, Burrell would help the princess locate, wrap and despatch more than 200 presents. Featuring heavily among these would be aromatherapy kits - which, for me, have come to symbolise the fragrant solitude of the modern civil sex war, as bored housewives and career girls too good for the miserable men on offer wallow in candle-lit limbo in aromatherapy baths called such things as Sensuality and Afterglow while their putative suitors download barnyard porn in their locked studies. Then there would come the Smythson address books, in hand-bound goatskin, \u00a3195, in which the princess and her circle might carefully write the personal details of all those close friends whose husbands and wives they would one day sleep with, if they hadn't already.</p> <p>I find it particularly poignant that she was apparently a collector of Halcyon Days enamel boxes; all that clutter, to soften that harsh, blaring life - \u00a385 for a poxing empty tin box! You can see why the firm has got four royal warrants, for its products' extortionate hollowness echoes the Windsor way. To obscure her loneliness even further, here comes her army of Herond hand-painted china animals, from \u00a355 for a tiny \"frog prince\" to \u00a34,000 for a limited-edition giraffe. \"Each year, I would ensure that the latest edition was carefully wrapped and placed inside the princess's stocking, which I had filled on Wills' and Harry's behalf,\" reports Burrell, and what a wealth of estrangement and loss there is in this good servant's innocent testimony. </p> <p>Diana would, according to Burrell, turn to Turnbull &amp; Asser for bespoke shirts, ties and dressing gowns for her faithless husband and stolen sons - I mention this only because the appropriateness of the name of this hawker of haberdashery to the ruling classes is so delightful. (Almost as gorgeous as my husband's divorce lawyers, Hart &amp; Loveless!) From J Floris would come scented candles, fragrances and vaporising oils - the princess was particularly fond of Seasonal Spice at this time of year, doubtless to drown out the pong of paranoia, the stink of betrayal and the whiff of cordite coming off Balmoral. </p> <p>Price's candles - a dozen for \u00a36.90 - would provide the lighting at every royal dining table, ensuring that daylight was not let in upon the magic and, even more important, that the hated face of the spouse opposite could be mutated - after a few tots of The King's Ginger Liqueur, available only from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd of St James - into the welcoming features of the beloved.</p> <p>From the General Trading Company - \"an Aladdin's Cave for those in Sloane Ranger territory\" - Diana would buy those tragic cushions whose mottos became so horribly apt with the unfurling of her miserable life. I'M A LUXURY FEW CAN AFFORD - GOOD GIRLS GO TO HEAVEN; BAD GIRLS GO EVERYWHERE - THOSE WHO SAY THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS DON'T KNOW WHERE TO SHOP. She would also pick up china sweet dishes, no doubt for her fellow bulimics to display their poison of choice. And she might grab a monogrammed washbag for her husband from Eximious, By Appointment To The Prince Of Wales, in which he might keep those all-important unguents for removing the stench of his adultery.</p> <p>Silver monogrammed key chains (\u00a340 upwards) make a perfect gift for men and women alike, apparently, and are so much more appropriate than the cufflinks saying \"Gladys\" and \"Fred\" which the ever-sensitive Prince Charles wore to dinner on the first night of his honeymoon, only to be amazed when his unreasonable, hysterical wife showed distress at his continuing devotion to his mistress. (In an interesting insight into the cesspit that is the Parker Bowles mind, isn't it attractive how the very idea of working-class names, attached to such obviously classy pieces of ass as herself and Chas, struck her as being such a hoot?)</p> <p> Much is made of Diana's \"lonely\" Christmases in later years, but I bet they seemed like heaven after being locked up with the Addams Family all those years. She did have family, after all - sisters and a brother who would have been happy to have her. But what people who are trapped in the tradition of the family Christmas fail to realise is that, once you have made good your escape, voluntary or otherwise, the prospect of living through the whole dreary panto again, this time with another set of personality disorders and ancient grudges, is not an especially attractive one.</p> <p>There is a lot of cant talked about The Family at Christmas, with those such as myself - preparing to face my first Christmas as an orphan - the focus of pity and concern from those who will be enmeshed in the bosom of theirs. But far from each family becoming a Holy Family at this time of year, it seems to my jaded outsider's eyes that, with a few lucky exceptions, most families become royal families, waving expensive geegaws at each other to divert attention from each other's dismay at having to play the same old tired roles - harassed housewife, bluff paterfamilias, exasperated adult children - that we spend the rest of the year struggling so valiantly to escape.</p> <p>Though I loved my parents to bits, the prospect of my first Christmas spent as a free agent - no one's daughter, mother or wife - seems incredibly exciting and exotic, and not a little overdue. So don't all you family types feel too sorry for us solitaires.

The cartoon is entitled Pouring over his Books. This is a pun. Have a student sit by a desk with a stack of books before him and reading out of one book'\". The student is pouring himself a gin and surrounded by a litter of empty bottles. </p> <p>\"'The humour in this cartoon is in the words pour and poir, one means to drink and the other means to study careful.' In the margin of this wondrous note,\" Thurber tells us, \"Ross had written 'Too subtle'.\" </p> <p>The homophone - a status which \"pour\" and the Runyonesque \"poir\" almost achieve - stalks the pages of the Guardian, as readers of the daily corrections column might testify. It is \"one of a group of words\", these regular readers will not need to be told, \"pronounced in the same way but differing in meaning or spelling or both\" (Collins). </p> <p>I admit to using the word to cover things which are not really homophones but near-homophones and near-misses for the word the writer failed to find in a desultory search that was abandoned too quickly. I would be perfectly happy to admit to failure in reducing the occurrence of homophones in the pages of the Guardian, but the admission would imply that I had expected success. I try to cling to reason. They are an infestation, breeding faster than they can be controlled. </p> <p>Thurber, had he lived to read the Guardian of today, might have been particularly tickled to learn that \"US polling officials have poured over thousands of ballot papers trying to detect voter intention...\" Pored was the word that eluded the writer. But this sort of thing, repeated and repeated, would have driven Harold Ross bananas. He, Thurber tells us, \"lived always in the wistful hope of getting out a magazine each week without a single mistake... overchecking was better than underchecking...\" </p> <p>Which leads us, nicely, to the readers' editor's second homophone test. Give yourself one point for marking the wrong word, and another for identifying the correct one. Maximum score 40 points. Anything over 35: good by our standards. </p> <p><strong>1:</strong> \"The proud Danes, [are] used to seeing hoards of Swedes make the 45-minute ferry crossing.\" </p> <p><strong> 2:</strong> Questions \"that illicit particularly spirited replies\". </p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> In a review of the band Radiohead we mentioned \"...guitar effects peddles that do everything short of telling jokes...\" </p> <p><strong> 4:</strong> \"...the madly rivalrous dictionaries which destroy the piece of my home\". </p> <p><strong> 5:</strong> \"Numerical targets become straightjackets for the very people who daily must cope.\" </p> <p><strong> 6:</strong> The local weather of Hampstead [hill] \"creates its own private and, one might say, rather well-healed cumulus\". </p> <p><strong> 7:</strong> \"Mr James is unlikely to be phased by the criticisms...\" </p> <p><strong> 8:</strong> \"The committee considered the use of soldiers to compliment police forces currently marshalling the largely peaceful _ protests.\" </p> <p><strong> 9:</strong> \"...his gangly build ...leant itself to professional basketball...\" </p> <p><strong> 10:</strong> \"She had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity...\" </p> <p><strong> 11:</strong> From the obituary of a film director in which we said one of his characters \"...wakes up from sexual ecstasy surrounded by bones and sculls\". </p> <p><strong> 12:</strong> In a column we compared the experience of making love with \"...being wrapped lightly across the knuckles with a damp envelope...\" </p> <p><strong> 13:</strong> \"The website revolves around a newspaper article detailing the grizzly murder of a character in the film.\" </p> <p><strong> 14:</strong> A headline: \"China accused of India breech\". </p> <p><strong> 15:</strong> In a report about the Ebola virus, we said that local people had been advised \"...to suspend cultural practices, such as burial rights\". </p> <p><strong>16:</strong> \"In Glaxo's case it was further problems with its controversial treatment for irritable bowl syndrome _\" </p> <p><strong> 17:</strong> From a diary of the floods: \"Started car to venture out for provisions _ brakes have ceased, won't move.\" </p> <p><strong> 18:</strong> \"BT, which is expected to formerly announce Brightstar as early as next month...\" </p> <p><strong> 19:</strong> In our collected recollections of the day Margaret Thatcher resigned, we quoted someone saying (improbably), \"They had a televised censor motion in the House of Commons and we were glued to it in the office.\" </p> <p><strong> 20:</strong> From a Country Diary: \"Later I counted 56 whooper swans, including five signets.\" </p> <p>Happy Christmas. </p> <p><strong>Answers:</strong> 1 hordes; 2 elicit; 3 pedals; 4 peace; 5 straitjackets (although some dictionaries allow straightjackets); 6 well-heeled; 7 fazed; 8 complement; 9 lent; 10 rein in; 11 skulls; 12 rapped; 13 grisly; 14 breach; 15 rites (but burial rights are not unimaginable); 16 bowel; 17 seized; 18 formally; 19 censure; 20 cygnets. </p> <p>\u0095 The Thurber story was pointed out by HI Scopes (thanks very much) and comes from The Years with Ross by James Thurber, first published in Britain by Hamish Hamilton in 1959.

      "bodyText": "The following note appears in James Thurber's account of his years at the New Yorker under its founding editor Harold Ross. \"...a suggestion from a reader _ 'I have an idea for a cartoon. The cartoon is entitled Pouring over his Books. This is a pun. Have a student sit by a desk with a stack of books before him and reading out of one book'\". The student is pouring himself a gin and surrounded by a litter of empty bottles. \"'The humour in this cartoon is in the words pour and poir, one means to drink and the other means to study careful.' In the margin of this wondrous note,\" Thurber tells us, \"Ross had written 'Too subtle'.\" The homophone - a status which \"pour\" and the Runyonesque \"poir\" almost achieve - stalks the pages of the Guardian, as readers of the daily corrections column might testify. It is \"one of a group of words\", these regular readers will not need to be told, \"pronounced in the same way but differing in meaning or spelling or both\" (Collins). I admit to using the word to cover things which are not really homophones but near-homophones and near-misses for the word the writer failed to find in a desultory search that was abandoned too quickly. I would be perfectly happy to admit to failure in reducing the occurrence of homophones in the pages of the Guardian, but the admission would imply that I had expected success. I try to cling to reason. They are an infestation, breeding faster than they can be controlled. Thurber, had he lived to read the Guardian of today, might have been particularly tickled to learn that \"US polling officials have poured over thousands of ballot papers trying to detect voter intention...\" Pored was the word that eluded the writer. But this sort of thing, repeated and repeated, would have driven Harold Ross bananas. He, Thurber tells us, \"lived always in the wistful hope of getting out a magazine each week without a single mistake... overchecking was better than underchecking...\" Which leads us, nicely, to the readers' editor's second homophone test. Give yourself one point for marking the wrong word, and another for identifying the correct one. Maximum score 40 points. Anything over 35: good by our standards. 1: \"The proud Danes, [are] used to seeing hoards of Swedes make the 45-minute ferry crossing.\" 2: Questions \"that illicit particularly spirited replies\". 3: In a review of the band Radiohead we mentioned \"...guitar effects peddles that do everything short of telling jokes...\" 4: \"...the madly rivalrous dictionaries which destroy the piece of my home\". 5: \"Numerical targets become straightjackets for the very people who daily must cope.\" 6: The local weather of Hampstead [hill] \"creates its own private and, one might say, rather well-healed cumulus\". 7: \"Mr James is unlikely to be phased by the criticisms...\" 8: \"The committee considered the use of soldiers to compliment police forces currently marshalling the largely peaceful _ protests.\" 9: \"...his gangly build ...leant itself to professional basketball...\" 10: \"She had to reign in some of the college's wilder entrepreneurial activity...\" 11: From the obituary of a film director in which we said one of his characters \"...wakes up from sexual ecstasy surrounded by bones and sculls\". 12: In a column we compared the experience of making love with \"...being wrapped lightly across the knuckles with a damp envelope...\" 13: \"The website revolves around a newspaper article detailing the grizzly murder of a character in the film.\" 14: A headline: \"China accused of India breech\". 15: In a report about the Ebola virus, we said that local people had been advised \"...to suspend cultural practices, such as burial rights\". 16: \"In Glaxo's case it was further problems with its controversial treatment for irritable bowl syndrome _\" 17: From a diary of the floods: \"Started car to venture out for provisions _ brakes have ceased, won't move.\" 18: \"BT, which is expected to formerly announce Brightstar as early as next month...\" 19: In our collected recollections of the day Margaret Thatcher resigned, we quoted someone saying (improbably), \"They had a televised censor motion in the House of Commons and we were glued to it in the office.\" 20: From a Country Diary: \"Later I counted 56 whooper swans, including five signets.\" Happy Christmas. Answers: 1 hordes; 2 elicit; 3 pedals; 4 peace; 5 straitjackets (although some dictionaries allow straightjackets); 6 well-heeled; 7 fazed; 8 complement; 9 lent; 10 rein in; 11 skulls; 12 rapped; 13 grisly; 14 breach; 15 rites (but burial rights are not unimaginable); 16 bowel; 17 seized; 18 formally; 19 censure; 20 cygnets. \u0095 The Thurber story was pointed out by HI Scopes (thanks very much) and comes from The Years with Ross by James Thurber, first published in Britain by Hamish Hamilton in 1959.

      "body": "<p>Maria Reviakina welcomes us to the Globus Theatre in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. She's a forceful woman who has managed this place for 13 years, struggling first with the Communist Party, then with the capitalist market. She looks a lot like Hillary Clinton, and has a photo of the two of them together to prove it. </p> <p>Seeing how sleepy we are after our journey from Britain, she gives us pickles, black Nescaf\u00e9 with sugar, marshmallows and shots of vodka for breakfast, and worries that our clothes will not be warm enough. \"We have to look after each other here, or we die,\" she says, and lends us all coats from her own wardrobe. </p> <p>I've travelled to Russia with the Royal Court and the British Council on a journey that will take in Novosibirsk and Moscow. In Siberia, Elyse Dodgson, head of the Royal Court's international department, will be workshopping a little-known playwriting technique called Verbatim, with the help of theatre director Ramin Gray and the breathtakingly energetic translator Tatyana Oskolkova, whom Gray nicknames the Unreliable Translator, as she can't resist occasionally adding her own opinions. </p> <p>Once the group gets to Moscow, Dodgson and Gray will be gauging the results of a previous visit by the Royal Court in April, when Stephen Daldry led a couple of seminars on playwriting. Their fingers are crossed: the idea is to find new talent that can eventually be brought over to Britain. \"It's not just cultural imperialism,\" is a comment made more than once. </p> <p>The last thing you'd expect a British theatre to have is an international department but, as Dodgson points out, the Royal Court needs plays. It staged a German season last year and, next April, it hopes to have a brief Russian season. Dodgson also draws a parallel between Russia now and Britain in the 1950s, when, surrounded by a sea of vaudeville and end-of-pier shows, the Royal Court decided that it would only show new plays, and began encouraging novelists and poets to have a go. The result has been a healthy four decades of premieres by playwrights such as John Osborne, Harold Pinter, Samuel Beckett, Caryl Churchill, Mark Ravenhill and Sarah Kane. </p> <p>Perhaps a similar vein can be tapped over here. There certainly seems to be an appetite. \"It is now as it was after the revolution,\" says Maria Reviakina. \"We have all fallen down, and have to pick ourselves up. Now everything is open. We can talk about anything. On television we can see the horrible truth about our lives. We need to find a new way to talk about it all. The problem is that there are no new plays.\" </p> <p>It's difficult for the inhabitants of a country as stable as Britain to appreciate the changes that Russia has seen in the past century. Sasha Dugdale, who brought the Royal Court to Russia when she was head of the British Council's arts commission in Moscow, is with us on the trip. She quotes something she was once told: \"In Russia, the 20th century was the age of the dictator.\" </p> <p>They came in all shapes and sizes, and they brought one catastrophe after another. Throughout, theatre was the mainstay of cultural life. Film and TV hardly registered. \"Everyone would go to the theatre because there we could hear the real story of what was happening,\" says Reviakina. \"In the time where no one could talk about anything, we could hear the real truth through this language.\" </p> <p>As a result, Russian actors and directors are treated like gods. Brian Cox, who directed The Crucible in Russia in the 1980s, wrote in his autobiography, Salem to Moscow, about his fervent disagreement with the local belief that artists should be venerated. \"In Russia, the struggle for existence is sharply focused: the need to create a cult of the actor or the writer comes from the lack of material well-being. But that fantasy can warp your perspective.\" </p> <p>Russian directors run their theatres, while producers play a subsidiary role: \"The director literally dies in the job,\" says Dugdale, who estimates the average age of the Muscovite director at around 70. \"It's next to impossible for younger directors to come up through the ranks. So everything stays traditional.\" And writers are at the very bottom of the pile. </p> <p>The technique that Dodgson is using is called Verbatim: theatre based on personal testimony. Actors or playwrights are sent off to interview family, friends or the homeless man at the railway station. The tape recordings are then transcribed and the words used as the basis for the script. When it works, there is a detail and a hyper-reality to the language that few playwrights would find in their imagination. \"Verbatim texts are words one can never write, even having lived three lives running,\" says director Alexander Zhelezstov. </p> <p>The workshops in Siberia get off to a fantastic start. Russian actors are famous for their breadth and passion. But this is berserk. One play is staged in the toilets, a flush used to get a laugh when things get too serious. One actress who had interviewed a friend who lost two older sibling twins, bursts into tears. Afterwards she exclaims: \"I finally understand Stanislavsky!\" We finish the workshops, sing songs (Inuit love songs!), make lots of toasts and then head to Moscow with everyone happy. But after a few days in Moscow, Siberia seems like a fantasy. </p> <p>In the capital, where the work is much further along, it seems as if everything has broken down. A score of scripts have been written since Daldry's visit; this week they will all be shown as a festival of new play writing. Every day four plays are staged, in two sessions, and every day they are dissected, and argued about, for at least two to three hours. No one seems to want to agree. The scripts are weak, or non-existent. One of the most popular young playwrights gets up and announces that he will not show anything because his project is a blunder. The directors keep changing the scripts to suit themselves. The actors only seem to care about looking good. Stories are being transformed into slapstick. In certain cliques, there appears to be some resentment of the outsiders. </p> <p>The plays are on topics such as Soldiers Injured in the Chechen War, Homelessness in Moscow, Alcoholism in the Provinces - all, as our translator points out, chernukha , the dark stuff. </p> <p>There are displays of bad acting, pontificating, upstaging - we are watching some truly terrible theatre. What are we doing here? It is not until we see some mainstream Russian theatre that it becomes clear why this work is so important. The New Play Association, the Russian organisation with which the Royal Court and the British Council are working, is cutting straight into new territory. </p> <p>Travelling around the city, we spot some playbills: one theatre is showing two Shakespeare plays, a Somerset Maugham, a Chekhov, and an Alan Ayckbourn. That's the norm and that's as dangerously contemporary as it gets. </p> <p>Going to a play in Moscow, we discover, is rather like going to church. When we manage to wangle tickets to see the latest production by Piotr Fomenko, there is absolute silence throughout the interval-free three hours. No one seems to even fidget until the reverential applause at the end. </p> <p>Fomenko is generally regarded as avant-garde, but to British eyes this work is traditional in the extreme. No nudity, no violence, a clear narrative, merry peasants who fall in love, the happiness of a simple life and a happy ending; even the RSC gets racier than this. </p> <p> The Kitchen is another work that is doing brilliantly at the box office. This time, unusually, it's a new play. The movie actor Oleg Menshikov commissioned the play from Maxim Kurochkin, and what we end up with is little more than a vehicle for the star and his impressive haircare routine. </p> <p>Our translator is not allowed to sit beside us, but tells us afterwards that it was something to do with Br\u00fcnnhilde and Siegfried and the Russian mafia, but she did not understand any more than that. She adds that no one else understood it either. </p> <p>After that, it's a relief to return to the tiny theatres the playwriting festival is occupying, and to the furious arguments that follow each performance. \"It seemed to me that they were all empty. It seemed to me that the actors were flattering the actors,\" says one director sharply. During the first discussion, people were still being careful, but now politeness has gone out of the window. \"It was not at all sincere, and I am not sure the Chechen war is a subject to be discussing in the theatre,\" says another director. An actor in the audience spells out what many seem to feel: \"Our reality is so complex, so senseless. I think that here in Russia we are not ready to take our lives onto the stage. I think the situation is so bad that the only way to present reality is through humour.\" </p> <p>In vain, Gray and Dodgson point out that a play that brings real life into the theatre can elevate the audience, enrich them. Works such as The Coalfield, by the Kemerovo theatre group from Siberia, show us the way. The theatre group spent weeks getting drunk with miners from the Kuzbass region, and taping the conversations. The result - three miners on stage, taking a break from work and chatting about calories, meat-eating, holidays, whatever - is inspirational. The cheering that follows is enthusiastic, to say the least. More arguments afterwards, of course. </p> <p>We are still waging war over the role of the director. Maxim Kurochkin claims the British \"say directors are bad and playwrights are good\". At this point, fury can be sensed in parts of the audience. A director who looks like Spandau Ballet's Tony Hadley says: \"You need a director to make sure that the audience can understand what's going on.\" Gray shouts back: \"How stupid do you think the audience is?\" Then he jumps up and says: \"Look, fuck art. What would you do if you were reading a novel that just said, 'I'm a novel, I'm a novel, look how novelistic I am'? You'd throw it away.\" \"Tony\" looks mutinous. Some people walk out; others cheer. </p> <p>By the end of the week the gloom that afflicted the British party has lifted. \"I feel so much better,\" says Dodgson. \"These people are incredibly brave, but you only realise that when you look at the context of Russian theatre. There really is nothing like this around.\" People keep telling her what a difference it has made to their perception of theatre: \"One director told me that for the first time he was actually listening to his actors and writers,\" she says, flushed with pleasure. </p> <p>Before we leave, there is just enough time for another round of vodka toasts: to Russia, to Britain, to the second world war, to women - and to theatre.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My TV series about the theatre has finished, and so too has my brief brush with celebrity - if that's what it is to be mildly mocked by Private Eye, called pompous and po-faced by a broadsheet TV critic and compared to Trevor Eve. I don't know who was the more hurt. The playwright and actor Patrick Marber told me before the series started that my private life would no longer be my own. \"Mobbed in the supermarket,\" he predicted gloomily, from the perspective of a man who has fronted a primetime comedy show with Steve Coogan.</p> <p> \"Heads won't turn in the Hammersmith Tesco,\" I assured him. Of course I was right. The nearest I have got to a mobbing was being chased by a 70-year-old man with a biro and an autograph book in Old Compton Street, and the nearest to seductive flattery was an overheard remark in a restaurant.</p> <p> An American woman, who had previously been speaking very loudly about flossing her teeth, announced that the only decent piece of television she had seen recently was called \"Changing Stages, fronted by this guy Richard Eyre\" - at which point she looked straight at me without a scintilla of recognition. I remembered John Osborne's remark about Peter Hall, who had complained in his diaries of being recognised wherever he went. \"If he'd walked down my local high street,\" said John Osborne, \"clanking in a Hever breastplate and gold-lam\u00e9 panty-girdle, scarcely a head would have turned...\" </p> <p> The best parties are not the ones where you know everybody or know nobody, they're the ones where you know some people who you only run into two or three times a year. With them you have an intensely stimulating relationship that quite possibly couldn't survive in conditions that don't involve shouting while negotiating a glass of champagne and a chicken vol-au-vent. I went to three last week where three different tribes were on show: publishers, journalists and actors. The publishers' party was in a darkish room populated by very jolly and quite young people who generated a noise that would have done credit to a Concorde engine test. </p> <p>I spotted Joanna Trollope stepping like a heron across the room towards the exit. The next day was the turn of journalists, supplemented by politicians, broadcasters and a few misfits like me - an annual affair held in a gentlemen's club.

      "bodyText": "My TV series about the theatre has finished, and so too has my brief brush with celebrity - if that's what it is to be mildly mocked by Private Eye, called pompous and po-faced by a broadsheet TV critic and compared to Trevor Eve. I don't know who was the more hurt. The playwright and actor Patrick Marber told me before the series started that my private life would no longer be my own. \"Mobbed in the supermarket,\" he predicted gloomily, from the perspective of a man who has fronted a primetime comedy show with Steve Coogan. \"Heads won't turn in the Hammersmith Tesco,\" I assured him. Of course I was right. The nearest I have got to a mobbing was being chased by a 70-year-old man with a biro and an autograph book in Old Compton Street, and the nearest to seductive flattery was an overheard remark in a restaurant. An American woman, who had previously been speaking very loudly about flossing her teeth, announced that the only decent piece of television she had seen recently was called \"Changing Stages, fronted by this guy Richard Eyre\" - at which point she looked straight at me without a scintilla of recognition. I remembered John Osborne's remark about Peter Hall, who had complained in his diaries of being recognised wherever he went. \"If he'd walked down my local high street,\" said John Osborne, \"clanking in a Hever breastplate and gold-lam\u00e9 panty-girdle, scarcely a head would have turned...\" The best parties are not the ones where you know everybody or know nobody, they're the ones where you know some people who you only run into two or three times a year. With them you have an intensely stimulating relationship that quite possibly couldn't survive in conditions that don't involve shouting while negotiating a glass of champagne and a chicken vol-au-vent. I went to three last week where three different tribes were on show: publishers, journalists and actors. The publishers' party was in a darkish room populated by very jolly and quite young people who generated a noise that would have done credit to a Concorde engine test. I spotted Joanna Trollope stepping like a heron across the room towards the exit. The next day was the turn of journalists, supplemented by politicians, broadcasters and a few misfits like me - an annual affair held in a gentlemen's club.

      "body": "<p>Talk of escape committees, wooden horses and tunnels does not usually enter the Coventry City vernacular until springtime. Just once since the formation of the Premiership have those escapologists par excellence City been in the relegation zone at the season's halfway stage. </p> <p>That is until this year. Held to a draw by Southampton, their fellow perennials in distress, they lie third from bottom, having taken five points from their last 10 games. Prospects for survival do not look good. </p> <p>City were unable to capitalise on a freakish goal by David Thompson against opponents who, with five men across the midfield, looked more than happy to settle for a draw before kick-off. </p> <p>Coventry again played the Moroccan midfielder Mustapha Hadji as a striker, leaving the leading scorer Craig Bellamy to use his pace on the left of the midfield quartet. Bellamy had done just that to good effect in City's solitary win in the previous 10 games - the 1-0 victory over Leicester. The Welsh international also scored the decisive goal on that occasion. </p> <p>This time Hadji had two early chances. Put through by Thompson in the 10th minute, the City skipper did not trouble Paul Jones, firing into the side-netting. The Saints keeper, however, had to be at his most athletic to keep out Hadji's second effort. </p> <p>Delivered from distance, Hadji's right-foot shot gained extra venom when it deflected off Claus Lundekvam but the diving Jones reacted swiftly, changing direction before palming the ball to safety. </p> <p>Despite their bright beginnings City were fortunate not to go behind midway through the first period when Jo Tessem headed wastefully wide of Chris Kirkland's goal from close range. </p> <p>The teenage goalkeeper, playing because Magnus Hedman had injured an ankle in training, was even more relieved when he was involved in a misunderstanding with Barry Quinn. Both went for an up and under and the ball skidded off the full-back's head just past City's upright. </p> <p>There was also an element of good fortune involved when City broke the deadlock from a free-kick taken from the left wing in the 34th minute. </p> <p>Given Thompson's previous failure to deliver two corners into the danger area, the prospects did not look good. But his free-kick, which barely went above head height, deceived friend and foe alike and skidded past Jones into the far corner of the goal. </p> <p>In the embers of the first period Tessem hit a fierce right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area that the diving Kirkland did well to save and at the other end Jones tipped over a powerful header from C\u00e9dric Roussel. </p> <p>Within six minutes of the restart Coventry's lead had been squandered, but not before Strachan had to reorganise his strike force. An injury to Roussel led to the introduction of Youssef Chippo in midfield with Bellamy pushed forward. Given the ease with which Southampton equalised, Strachan might have done better to bring on a defender. </p> <p>James Beattie was given the freedom of the left flank to accept Wayne Bridge's pass, as was Tessem in the penalty area when he headed the subsequent cross past Kirkland. </p> <p>Five minutes from time a right-foot shot from City's third substitute Ysrael Zuniga bounced to safety off Jones's left-hand post. But with seconds remaining City enjoyed some good fortune when a shot from Beattie deflected off Paul Williams past Kirkland and also beyond the post.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Talk of escape committees, wooden horses and tunnels does not usually enter the Coventry City vernacular until springtime. Just once since the formation of the Premiership have those escapologists par excellence City been in the relegation zone at the season's halfway stage. That is until this year. Held to a draw by Southampton, their fellow perennials in distress, they lie third from bottom, having taken five points from their last 10 games. Prospects for survival do not look good. City were unable to capitalise on a freakish goal by David Thompson against opponents who, with five men across the midfield, looked more than happy to settle for a draw before kick-off. Coventry again played the Moroccan midfielder Mustapha Hadji as a striker, leaving the leading scorer Craig Bellamy to use his pace on the left of the midfield quartet. Bellamy had done just that to good effect in City's solitary win in the previous 10 games - the 1-0 victory over Leicester. The Welsh international also scored the decisive goal on that occasion. This time Hadji had two early chances. Put through by Thompson in the 10th minute, the City skipper did not trouble Paul Jones, firing into the side-netting. The Saints keeper, however, had to be at his most athletic to keep out Hadji's second effort. Delivered from distance, Hadji's right-foot shot gained extra venom when it deflected off Claus Lundekvam but the diving Jones reacted swiftly, changing direction before palming the ball to safety. Despite their bright beginnings City were fortunate not to go behind midway through the first period when Jo Tessem headed wastefully wide of Chris Kirkland's goal from close range. The teenage goalkeeper, playing because Magnus Hedman had injured an ankle in training, was even more relieved when he was involved in a misunderstanding with Barry Quinn. Both went for an up and under and the ball skidded off the full-back's head just past City's upright. There was also an element of good fortune involved when City broke the deadlock from a free-kick taken from the left wing in the 34th minute. Given Thompson's previous failure to deliver two corners into the danger area, the prospects did not look good. But his free-kick, which barely went above head height, deceived friend and foe alike and skidded past Jones into the far corner of the goal. In the embers of the first period Tessem hit a fierce right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area that the diving Kirkland did well to save and at the other end Jones tipped over a powerful header from C\u00e9dric Roussel. Within six minutes of the restart Coventry's lead had been squandered, but not before Strachan had to reorganise his strike force. An injury to Roussel led to the introduction of Youssef Chippo in midfield with Bellamy pushed forward. Given the ease with which Southampton equalised, Strachan might have done better to bring on a defender. James Beattie was given the freedom of the left flank to accept Wayne Bridge's pass, as was Tessem in the penalty area when he headed the subsequent cross past Kirkland. Five minutes from time a right-foot shot from City's third substitute Ysrael Zuniga bounced to safety off Jones's left-hand post. But with seconds remaining City enjoyed some good fortune when a shot from Beattie deflected off Paul Williams past Kirkland and also beyond the post.",

This week I was back in the studio re-recording the show for a second run on New Year's Eve (at the BBC, this is not known as a repeat, it is merely referred to as \"maximising archive resources\"). </p> <p>On going back over the tape of the initial broadcast we discovered that virtually everything had to be updated. Back then, all of three months ago, we were comfortable in our certainties about the stadium. No clich\u00e9 was left unturned as we talked of the wrecking ball hovering, the twin towers being shipped off to the highest bidder and a state-of-the-art facility being born, magnificently, from the dust. </p> <p>Now, after just under 10 weeks of mismanagement, everything has changed. We do not know when or if work will begin demolishing the old stadium, we do not know what shape its replacement will take and, as for when the new place will be ready for business, it is anyone's guess. In short, like Manuel in Fawlty Towers, we know nothing.

      "bodyText": "Back in October I worked on a Radio 5 Live programme compiling an obituary for Wembley stadium. This week I was back in the studio re-recording the show for a second run on New Year's Eve (at the BBC, this is not known as a repeat, it is merely referred to as \"maximising archive resources\"). On going back over the tape of the initial broadcast we discovered that virtually everything had to be updated. Back then, all of three months ago, we were comfortable in our certainties about the stadium. No clich\u00e9 was left unturned as we talked of the wrecking ball hovering, the twin towers being shipped off to the highest bidder and a state-of-the-art facility being born, magnificently, from the dust. Now, after just under 10 weeks of mismanagement, everything has changed. We do not know when or if work will begin demolishing the old stadium, we do not know what shape its replacement will take and, as for when the new place will be ready for business, it is anyone's guess. In short, like Manuel in Fawlty Towers, we know nothing. Only in the country that gave the world Railtrack could such spectacular public incompetence be possible. But this week, we are told by the Football Association, things will start to happen. Now that dynamic new leadership is in place, it will, to use the current buzzword, take the project forward. And of whom does that leadership consist? Well, it is Sir Rodney Walker, who will take a few moments off from running everything else from Leicester City FC to the rugby league to chair a committee he was sitting on in the first place. Meanwhile, although Ken Bates has been removed as chairman, he will continue to sit on the steering committee, because it would be a pity to waste his expertise. He did, after all, mastermind the grim white elephant that is Chelsea Village. In other words, it is the same old mob who got us into this mess in the first place.

Glancing at it, many must have thought the Spurs supporter in question was the garrulous Richard Littlejohn, finally putting his money where his mouth has been. Or perhaps Chas and Dave had sold the old Joanna and bought White Hart Lane on the proceeds. Maybe Warren Mitchell, Hunter Davies and Danny Kelly had had a whip-round. But no. The fan was a certain Daniel Levy. And, although he is undoubtedly a committed supporter, Spurs fans have not got themselves a Mohammed Al Fayed. </p> <p>Levy is not about to come along, chequebook akimbo, prepared to treat Tottenham as a pet project, willing to spend whatever it takes to get them to the top. Unlike Fayed, he will not be seen trotting across the pitch before kick-off, waving a giant scarf at the crowd. He will not be found entering the home dressing room, telling his boys to go out and fuggin win. He will not even be heard rapping on the club song. </p> <p>Levy is chief executive of a voracious organisation called Enic, which has stakes in several football clubs already, including Rangers. His interest in Spurs is as a business proposition. Everything he does from now on will be done to extract maximum shareholder value from the club, irrespective of whether that clashes with his aspirations as a supporter. In fact, whatever the headline may imply, as a fan takeover it is a non-starter. </p> <p>So just what does constitute a genuine fan takeover? </p> <p>\"We are about grassroots involvement, supporters who want to be more than turnstile fodder, who want to band together to use their energies to the betterment of their club,\" says Steve Warby, of the government-funded body Supporters Direct, set up this September to encourage greater fan ownership of football clubs. \"It is about democratic control. We wouldn't count some rich bloke who happens to be a supporter taking over on his own as a model of what we want to do.\" </p> <p>Although the Spurs business implies that the rich bloke who happens to be a fan is still the usual way of football club ownership, Supporters Direct's year might suggest things are changing. </p> <p>\"Supporters from 97 different clubs have been in touch with us since we started,\" says Warby. \"We now have 18 supporters' trusts up and running, with supporters on the board at four clubs.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most dramatic example of true fan involvement this year has been at Lincoln City, where the chair of the supporters' trust has recently been asked to become acting chairman of the football club. </p> <p>\"It all came as a bit of a shock,\" says Rob Bradley, Lincoln's new top man. \"There's no other way of putting it, the club has financial problems. And the previous chairman, John Eames, felt the best way of attracting new investment was to resign. </p> <p>\"He made the admirable gesture of saying that his shares would be made available only to a bidder who was willing to invest a sum equivalent to their value directly into the club. I was chairman of the supporters trust and he approached me to take over until that investment became available.\" </p> <p>And Bradley's tenure might not be temporary. The Lincoln supporters' trust has been working to put together the necessary \u00a3400,000 investment and is, apparently, very close to meeting the terms set out by Eames. </p> <p>\"What we want is community ownership,\" says Bradley. \"And that has to strike a balance with local business support, because obviously even collectively, the ordinary fans don't have deep enough pockets. There will also need to be some sort of democratic control. But we honestly believe we supporters could run Lincoln as a going concern once the historic debts have been removed.\" </p> <p>More and more football supporters are beginning to realise that by banding together, by seeking cooperation with local businesses, there is another way to secure their club's future beyond praying that the chairman of Harrods will take it over - or even the chief executive of Enic.

But \"Pudge!\".... just because of those few extra pounds after the Xmas break?...Expect a robust response! Ohhh!. . .Manager goes down in the box - and the referee waves play on! Ho ho! the romance of the cup?. . . isn't it? Marvellous! The big fish forced to confront the minnows in their owner ponds!...trip down memory lane...hmm? Crackle of the old crystal set: Manager chases a hopeful punt up-field!...Ohhh...the ball stops dead in a puddle! Manager carries on sliding foolishly by... Great stuff! Doesn't happen nowadays...hmm? Players slithering around hopelessly in the mud...marvellous! ...reminiscent of Torville and Dean in their pomp!...Bolero!...wasn't it?... always caused a strange stirring in the loins...ultimately causing Mrs Manager to confiscate the video. Have modern playing surfaces taken away some of the excitement of the beautiful game?...hmm? No chance of a mighty giant-killing at Leyton Orient for plucky Northwich Victoria on a highly predictable pitch covered in 60 tons of sand. So the mighty O's earn a glamour tie against Spurs...two evenly-matched titans from north London! Mouth-watering stuff, hmm?...And it's turbulent times at Tottenham!...Sugar's selling up! Will Glenn return to his spiritual home? Ooh.. er. It's all change at White Hart Lane! All change at Seven Sisters usually...bloody irritating! And a readers letter! Pete Besley of Walthamstow writes: \"Why don't Arsenal **** off back south of the river?\" Well, Peter, I'm afraid I'm going to yellow-card you there - foul and abusive language! And do I detect a little touch of envy? hmm? Arsene's running a tight ship up at Arsenal's new home in Highbury! Sylvian Wiltord fined for persistent lateness! What's wrong with modern footballers? I was always a stickler for discipline - though Tel's revelation that Alan Sugar wanted to flog Nick Barmby to pay for the south stand at Tottenham er...beggars belief! But punctuality? In my playing days you could set your watch by me! Even now! Ask Mrs Manager - she reckons my bladder's my alarm clock!... er... slept right through twice this week... incurring foul and abusive lan guage from Mrs Manager...marvellous! Well, as the year staggers to a close, it's time for Ron's Round-up! Festive cheer for Boro! the Christmas tree formation! er ho ho ho! Terry's got them going! The pinning of the team sheet on the dressing-room door... a little tingle? Young men in their prime...the pinning of the stocking to the end of the bed. hmm? small boys? All a-quiver? under the covers?...er. Where was I, er. Yes! Well to the players...Robbo is still the one they call 'The Gaffer', but time will tell! Just ask The Socceroos! Still an er, unexpected away defeat for Chelsea! and blow me! Ken Bates didn't attend the game! And my most humble apologies to Santa at the Riverside club shop for any distress caused...the innuendo that he was a complete charlatan...the implications that the \"benevolent old gentleman\" was the stuff of fantasy. The constant tugging of his beard...well, I wish the earth would swallow me up...a complete case of mistaken identity! Well, you can say what you like about Ken Bates...what?...oh, you can't? But Ken's as bullish as ever! Forget the crap about Claudio Ranieri not speaking English!...Jean Tigana can't - and look what he's doing at Fulham! Don't be surprised if Chelsea are heading the promotion race this time next season! And the race is on again at the top! As the mighty Reds put the mighty Reds... er gas at a peep - as Sir Alex would say! Ho ho you don't have to 'speaka de Eengleesh' to do alright in the Premiership! 1-0 to Liverpool! Barthez beaten by an unexpected peach from Murphy...bit like being beaten by an unexpected potato from The Man from Del Monte! Ho ho! marvellous! And this week's \"One to Watch\" Batty! No, not David Batty. Paolo di Canio! Ho ho! He's nuts! never a dull moment at Upton Park! Another letter for Ron's \"Where are they Now?\" Helen Eyers of Walthamstow writes: \"I'm spending Christmas with the in-laws, and my 'partner' had an accumulator worth four grand riding on a 2-1 victory for West Ham last weekend. If I catch that **** Di Canio, I'll...\" Er Helen...I'm going to have to hand out another yellow card! But the game needs its characters! Look at David Ginola's cheeky response to John Gregory's attempts to kick-start him - and let me take reader's votes here - was Ginola \"carrying a bit of timber\"... hmm?...results next week! And, be fair... who wouldn't proudly display a rippling torso when in their youthful pomp! And in my day it wasn't the six-pack...ho ho!...it was your party-seven!

It is hard to imagine Wenger ever seeing the funny side after such an exasperating loss. </p> <p>Yet, despite the German influence, most of Wenger's transfer dealings have been conducted in francs rather than deutschmarks while Houllier, born in the Pas-de-Calais, has recruited a quartet of Allemands chers - Dietmar Hamman, Markus Babbel, Christian Ziege and the departed Karlheinz Riedle - ahead of jeunes Fran\u00e7ais . </p> <p>Should Arsenal fail to end an eight-year stretch without a win at Anfield, tonight's meal will surely be on Houllier.

Success today to follow up that at Old Trafford last week would take him within a point of the Gunners. </p> <p>Phil Thompson does much of the ranting and raving at Anfield, although the Liverpool executive vice-chairman Peter Robinson still likened Houllier to Bill Shankly in his driven approach: \"They share many of the same attributes as managers; single-mindedness, knowing exactly what they want and ability to communicate well.

Born in Cumnock some 30 miles south of Ferguson's Glaswegian roots, the Ipswich manager returns this afternoon to the scene of his Town debut 27 years ago. Then the 17-year-old was charged with man-marking George Best in his last home league game. </p> <p>\"He was in the twilight of his career and not at his fittest but he still had great skills,\" Burley recalled. </p> <p>As he attempts to mastermind Town's first win at United since 1984, the 9-0 thrashing at Old Trafford in March 1995 will provoke fresher memories than the sight of Best tearing off into the distance. Andy Cole, who scored five times that day, may be negotiating a lucrative new contract but at least he is hamstrung and absent this time around. </p> <p>Ferguson was impressed with the calm, self-effacing Burley even in the wake of that massacre. \"George's initial reaction at the end of that game could have been to jump into a hole,\" he said. \"But he stopped, turned around and shook my hand. It took a lot to do that. It was impressive. He's shown a lot of resolve in himself and a determination to overcome disappointments.\" </p> <p>Less surprisingly Burley has learnt much from his compatriot's example. \"I have so much respect for him and what he has achieved at United,\" he said. \"He runs the team the way it should be and has done amazingly well, showing the importance of producing your own players through the ranks. United are the perfect example of that; we are trying to do the same and have produced some of the best players in the country in the last four years. </p> <p>\"I love bringing these lads through the youth team. We can't match the big clubs on wages and transfer fees but we can more than match them for bringing through young players and improving them.

      "body": "<p>It is the day after the Derby players' Christmas party and they are expecting a modicum of sympathy from the coaching staff, no doubt hoping to finish the training session with nothing more strenuous than a little light ball-work. </p> <p>Instead, during the final 40 minutes, they are not only denied a touch of the ball but also a feel of the training pitch turf, forced to make their goalmouth to goalmouth runs in a series of races against one another along opposite sides of the touchline. </p> <p>While some players thunder enthusiastically down the lines, Georgi Kinkladze's sweat glands are under no threat as he shuffles along with the green tongues of his boots flapping as gently as bat wings. </p> <p>To be fair, he has not played for a month because of a persistent groin injury and he is only really happy running when there is a ball at his feet. In fact, a few minutes earlier, when playing keepy-uppy with a few team-mates, his smile could have lit up Oxford Street. </p> <p>The Georgian is one of the quieter men on the training pitch and despite the KI INKY number plate on his Porsche Carrera, which suggests a social life to match Dwight Yorke's, he is a diffident soul off the pitch, too. </p> <p>It is in the heat of a match, sprinkling his magic dust over the play, that Kinkladze expresses himself. Which makes it all the more frustrating that he has spent most of his season making work for the club doctor and masseur, while making the occasional cameo appearance as a Premiership substitute. </p> <p>Kinkladze, 27, who underwent a groin operation after injuring himself in pre-season training, says: \"It has been very frustrating for me, particularly as the team have not been playing well and you can't do anything to help them when you're sitting in the treatment room. </p> <p>\"I didn't expect the team to be in this position again after surviving last season.

      "bodyText": "It is the day after the Derby players' Christmas party and they are expecting a modicum of sympathy from the coaching staff, no doubt hoping to finish the training session with nothing more strenuous than a little light ball-work. Instead, during the final 40 minutes, they are not only denied a touch of the ball but also a feel of the training pitch turf, forced to make their goalmouth to goalmouth runs in a series of races against one another along opposite sides of the touchline. While some players thunder enthusiastically down the lines, Georgi Kinkladze's sweat glands are under no threat as he shuffles along with the green tongues of his boots flapping as gently as bat wings. To be fair, he has not played for a month because of a persistent groin injury and he is only really happy running when there is a ball at his feet. In fact, a few minutes earlier, when playing keepy-uppy with a few team-mates, his smile could have lit up Oxford Street. The Georgian is one of the quieter men on the training pitch and despite the KI INKY number plate on his Porsche Carrera, which suggests a social life to match Dwight Yorke's, he is a diffident soul off the pitch, too. It is in the heat of a match, sprinkling his magic dust over the play, that Kinkladze expresses himself. Which makes it all the more frustrating that he has spent most of his season making work for the club doctor and masseur, while making the occasional cameo appearance as a Premiership substitute. Kinkladze, 27, who underwent a groin operation after injuring himself in pre-season training, says: \"It has been very frustrating for me, particularly as the team have not been playing well and you can't do anything to help them when you're sitting in the treatment room. \"I didn't expect the team to be in this position again after surviving last season. But we had a terrible start and the players are still short of confidence, though they played well in last week's win over Coventry.\" Kinkladze is desperate to return for the Christmas action, especially Derby's Boxing Day visit to Manchester City where the fans still revere him and are sure to give him a fantastic reception. Many of them still write hero-grams to him at Pride Park. In a way it is a typically perverse Manchester City thing to do, since in Kinkladze's first season, 1995-6, the side were relegated from the Premiership and the manager Alan Ball became a laughing stock. But Kinkladze was their fantasy player who weaved his spells from midfield. Though he only managed 20 goals in 106 appearances, many of them were collectors' items. Indeed, when Derby's manager Jim Smith received a video from Kinkladze's agent before signing him on loan a year ago, one of the clips was of him in City colours, turning Newcastle's John Beresford and Steve Howey inside out. City received a club record fee of \u00a34.92m from Ajax for him in May 1998 but he found it impossible to settle after being asked by the coach Jan Wouters to play on the left wing. He admits to suffering homesickness for Manchester and when you ask him what he loved most about City, he says: \"Everything.\" Smith, who paid \u00a33m to make the transfer permanent at the end of last season, eased Kinkladze into this one following his operation and when he scored a glorious goal against Leeds in September a minute or so after coming on as substitute, it seemed that his season was up and running, so to speak.

On the pitch during his five-year reign at Tottenham, first as the manager and then, from June 1991, as the chief executive, he flourished. Spurs won the FA Cup under Venables in 1991 and by the time he was sacked by Sugar was close to building a team of potential. But off the pitch, as El Tel swapped training ground for boardroom, he was accused by Sugar of financial irregularities and cronyism that eventually led to his sacking. </p> <p>\"I think he will be given a very warm reception by the Spurs fans,\" said the former Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt, who played under Venables. \"The football side of things was always good.

Venables had already been at Spurs for two years and soon after the 1991 FA Cup final victory over Nottingham Forest ploughed \u00a33.5m into the club to become chief executive. Sugar invested just under \u00a38m and became chairman. </p> <p>\"We thought it was the ideal partnership,\" said Mabbutt. \"Sugar's business acumen combined with Venables' knowledge of football. At that stage the club was already in financial trouble and desperately needed Sugar's help. The players thought the partnership was going to be a huge success. There was a very positive mood when the two men came together.\" </p> <p>Mabbutt claims that, as Sugar's and Venables' relationship deteriorated behind the scenes, on the pitch and the training ground it did not affect the players. </p> <p>\"We were shielded from it,\" he said. \"We did not know what was going on. The only effect on us was that once Terry became chief executive he spent less time on the training pitch and we really missed him. That's where Terry's strength and skill lay, working with players. Sugar's strength was business.\" </p> <p>The two were rarely seen together at the club and Mabbutt remembers having little contact with Sugar, apart from him coming into the players' dressing room to wish them luck before a match. \"We never saw Terry and Sugar together.

      "body": "<p>Aston Villa have confirmed the signing of the Colombia striker Juan Pablo Angel from Argentina's River Plate for a club record fee of \u00a39.5m. The deal was signed in the early hours of yesterday morning after what a club spokesman described as \"a complicated process involving several parties\". </p> <p>The Villa manager John Gregory said: \"I am delighted to have signed him. I have said for quite a while that we have a comfort zone up front in terms of not having enough competition among the strikers. Juan will provide that. </p> <p>\"I spoke to him last night and he is very excited about the prospect of coming to play in the Premiership. He can't wait to get started but knows he will be under a lot of pressure to deliver the goods straight away. However, I'm confident he will be up to the task.\" </p> <p>Angel, who also attracted the interest of Bayern Munich, requires a work permit, though no delays are expected. He is expected to complete the formalities next week and may make his debut against Leicester on December 30. </p> <p>Angel is a regular for the Colombian national side, and while that will ease his passage into the country, it may also present problems for Gregory next year. Colombia still have eight World Cup qualifiers to play and are locked in a three-way battle with Ecuador and Uruguay for two qualification slots. Angel is also likely to be involved in next summer's Copa America in his home country. </p> <p>Gregory said: \"It is true that the World Cup qualifiers for Colombia come at a fairly awkward time for us next November. Some of the dates fall in line with our own breaks over here for internationals, but there will be one or two problems.\" </p> <p>Villa's previous record fee was the \u00a37m paid by Brian Little to Liverpool for Stan Collymore in 1997. The souring of Collymore's relationship with Gregory, like that of fellow strikers Savo Milosevic and Benito Carbone, offer ominous portents for Angel, but having scored 17 goals in as many games for River Plate this season he should at least arrive full of confidence. </p> <p>Gregory's initial target to beef up his attack was Celta Vigo's South African Benni McCarthy, who knew the club well from Uefa Cup encounters, but at more than \u00a313m his price was out of their range. </p> <p>Newcastle United's French defender Didier Domi may have played his last game for the club having refused to return from a break in France. </p> <p>Domi, whose comments on a French website last week criticising the United manager Bobby Robson's training methods drew a frosty response on Tyneside, was given permission to return home last weekend. His failure to reappear on Monday led to a maximum two-week fine of around \u00a330,000, but he has still to return to the North-east. </p> <p>\"We have been in touch with him but we do not know when he is going to come back,\" Robson said yesterday. \"The longer it goes on the harder it will be for him, but I have implored him to return. He has let us down, but we need him for the matches next week.\" </p> <p>Manchester City striker Danny Allsopp has joined Notts County for \u00a3300,000. The Australia international has been on loan at Meadow Lane.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa have confirmed the signing of the Colombia striker Juan Pablo Angel from Argentina's River Plate for a club record fee of \u00a39.5m. The deal was signed in the early hours of yesterday morning after what a club spokesman described as \"a complicated process involving several parties\". The Villa manager John Gregory said: \"I am delighted to have signed him. I have said for quite a while that we have a comfort zone up front in terms of not having enough competition among the strikers. Juan will provide that. \"I spoke to him last night and he is very excited about the prospect of coming to play in the Premiership. He can't wait to get started but knows he will be under a lot of pressure to deliver the goods straight away. However, I'm confident he will be up to the task.\" Angel, who also attracted the interest of Bayern Munich, requires a work permit, though no delays are expected. He is expected to complete the formalities next week and may make his debut against Leicester on December 30. Angel is a regular for the Colombian national side, and while that will ease his passage into the country, it may also present problems for Gregory next year. Colombia still have eight World Cup qualifiers to play and are locked in a three-way battle with Ecuador and Uruguay for two qualification slots. Angel is also likely to be involved in next summer's Copa America in his home country. Gregory said: \"It is true that the World Cup qualifiers for Colombia come at a fairly awkward time for us next November. Some of the dates fall in line with our own breaks over here for internationals, but there will be one or two problems.\" Villa's previous record fee was the \u00a37m paid by Brian Little to Liverpool for Stan Collymore in 1997. The souring of Collymore's relationship with Gregory, like that of fellow strikers Savo Milosevic and Benito Carbone, offer ominous portents for Angel, but having scored 17 goals in as many games for River Plate this season he should at least arrive full of confidence. Gregory's initial target to beef up his attack was Celta Vigo's South African Benni McCarthy, who knew the club well from Uefa Cup encounters, but at more than \u00a313m his price was out of their range. Newcastle United's French defender Didier Domi may have played his last game for the club having refused to return from a break in France. Domi, whose comments on a French website last week criticising the United manager Bobby Robson's training methods drew a frosty response on Tyneside, was given permission to return home last weekend. His failure to reappear on Monday led to a maximum two-week fine of around \u00a330,000, but he has still to return to the North-east. \"We have been in touch with him but we do not know when he is going to come back,\" Robson said yesterday. \"The longer it goes on the harder it will be for him, but I have implored him to return. He has let us down, but we need him for the matches next week.\" Manchester City striker Danny Allsopp has joined Notts County for \u00a3300,000. The Australia international has been on loan at Meadow Lane.",

      "body": "<p>The first thing to hit one is the transformation of the space. With its black walls and high-banked seats, the Barbican's Pit has never been one of London's more seductive venues. Now it has been turned into a replica of the gleaming white box, with straight-edged stage and comfortably tiered seats, that David Fielding created at Stratford's Other Place. The result is that the spirit gets a lift as soon as one enters the auditorium. </p> <p>Steven Pimlott's production of Richard II is as radical as Fielding's reinvention of the space. In place of lyrical tragedy we get a political drama in which Bolingbroke, from the first moment he accuses Mowbray of the Duke of Gloucester's death, is staging a carefully plotted coup d'etat; what he cannot guess is that Richard will play so easily into his hands. By using key lines as verbal motifs, Pimlott also turns the play into a sombre meditation on the vanity of power. At the end the newly crowned Henry IV repeats the lines with which Richard began the play - \"I have been studying how I may compare the prison where I live unto the world\" - as if he too has learned that kingship is a form of solitary confinement. </p> <p>The idea of treating Richard and Bolingbroke as parallel, rather than antithetical, figures was visible at Stratford. What has changed is the enriching detail of the performance. Samuel West's Richard was always good, but it has now grown into a superb study of doomed capriciousness. \"What reverence he did throw away on slaves,\" cries West, laughing at Bolingbroke's crowd-pleasing exit from London. </p> <p>The lesson West's Richard painfully learns is that even a sanctified king rules only by popular consent; in the great central scenes of the play he gives us, instead of lyrical arias, a man awakening to his own isolation. Compact with irony and intelligence, it is a performance that augurs well for West's Stratford Hamlet. </p> <p>But David Troughton skilfully reminds us the play is just as much about Bolingbroke as Richard. Where the two men differ is in their attitude to power. If Richard relies on divine right, Troughton's Bolingbroke is a political fixer who is always working the crowd or appealing directly to the audience. But Troughton also highlights the parallels between the two men - not just their kingly solitude but their eye for symbolic gesture, so that Bolingbroke returns from banishment clutching a handful of the earth he once reluctantly left. \"Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,\" cries Bolingbroke at one point, echoing Richard's own line. </p> <p>West and Troughton are ideally matched, but there is also strong support from David Killick as a constitutionally confused Duke of York, Alexis Daniel as a survival-conscious Aumerle and Catherine Walker as a beautifully grieving queen. Jason Carr's music, with its bells and chimes, also evokes a kingdom where concord is constantly threatened by incipient chaos. You can see the influences, from Barton to Brook, on Pimlott's Richard; it remains, however, a brilliant production in its own right, of startling relevance to the current debate on monarchy. </p> <p> \u0095 Until April 17.
