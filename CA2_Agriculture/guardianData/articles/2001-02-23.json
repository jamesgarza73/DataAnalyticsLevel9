He plays better in international football than for Spurs.

He is doubtful for the Spain game and that nagging injury situation is the only reservation you would put against someone who has the lot. He can tackle, pass, do the holding job and also support and get his shots in. </p> <p>The hope has to be that, as he gets older and stronger, the injuries disappear because I can see Eriksson wanting him in a five-man midfield in a lot of games, with Heskey as a lone striker. In international football you have to control the middle of the park, and in any case people coming from deep can be more difficult to mark, as Pablo Aimar showed for Valencia. </p> <p>Beckham would be my playmaker from the centre of midfield but I wouldn't want him to be a deep playmaker, constantly playing five yards off the defenders. I'd like him to be getting the ball higher up the field and making the play from there. </p> <p>What really sticks in mind is the goal he scored for United in the 3-2 defeat by Real Madrid last season, when he picked up the ball in the last third, sidestepped two defenders and unleashed a rocket shot. I would like to see him do that more often. </p> <p>Beckham's best value is in the top half. People say that against Valencia he did not do well but he was stuck on the right wing. He is not a winger and, if he gets pinned down, he is fairly easy to mark. He can go at people but he is not Ryan Giggs. He is better at beating people with passing and movement off the ball. </p> <p>When he plays in central areas he has the quality to play good balls into the front and then support on the outside. In a way I would like to see him fill the sort of role Bobby Charlton did for England. Bobby could come deep but he made sure he got forward enough times. </p> <p>It is important that the midfield players are encouraged to do that, and that is Scholes's natural game. If you took a poll among football people, an awful lot would have Scholes as the country's most valuable player. He has that priceless asset from midfield of being able to do a lot of the busy, ugly work and be an expert finisher when he gets in the box. </p> <p>He may not be the best defensively but he is trying to improve on that and, if England are to play with just one striker in a lot of games, midfield players who can support the strikers, get into scoring positions and finish are vital. </p> <p>To be that lone striker you need a physical presence and Heskey has it. He is developing more and more into a player who can protect the ball from defenders if it is played into him and he has the pace to go it alone. </p> <p>The thing that convinced me - and I hope it was not a flash in the pan - was his performance against Italy when he was up against Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro, two of the most dogmatic, natural defenders in the world. They were very respectful of him. </p> <p>If he continues the progress he is making at Liverpool and carries on learning about movement and making runs, he can be the man for England. He could still do with scoring a few ugly goals, going in for sliding tap-ins, but he has got more headers in this season and there has been an improvement in his finishing. </p> <p>Of course he could also play in a pair with Michael Owen or Robbie Fowler but I would start him alone against Spain in this side: Seaman; Gary Neville, Brown, Campbell, Ashley Cole; Dyer, Beckham, Gerrard or Ince, Scholes, McManaman; Heskey. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>So at last I have left Malaysia. I re-entered Singapore to fly to Bali through the 'back door' - by train from Kuala Lumpur. Anyone who has been in Singapore airport will know that it epitomises the country, flash, efficient, air-con, expensive shops. By contrast the railway station is scruffy, not many facilities and a roadside-type canteen. This puzzled me until I was told that all Singaporeans fly and in fact the station belongs to Malaysia. </p> <p>I returned briefly to my nephew's to pick up a few things. I had bought a sports bag for those times when I go off for just a few days, and somehow this has become full as well. I haven't bought much - only another pair of shorts, two T-shirts, a pair of flip flops, a second novel, and a few toilet rolls - this was a mistake as I asked for one in a market and was sold one pack of 12. I've taken the middles out and did abandon some. . . perhaps I am beginning to see how I have filled another bag. Oh and I forgot the dozen hotel soaps. </p> <p>With all my bags I arrived in Bali at 1am. Despite all the warnings from emailers I stayed in Kuta that night as it was so near. Having had a few late nights and not getting to bed that night until after 2am, I got the shock of my life when I woke the next day to find it was 2pm. The staff were polite enough to laugh when I asked if it was too late for breakfast. A wander through Kuta, crowded with touts, bronzed surfers, and pink Europeans led me straight to the travel office to book a ticket to Ubud, where I am now. </p> <p>Still fairly touristy, Ubud is much more laid back than Kuta with far fewer touts. Wandering around the shops full of paintings, wood carvings, batik and knick-knacks can fill many an hour. There is a dance show every evening and I went to see the Larong dance, the more formal court dancing with wonderful costumes. It was great. I met up with American Ed, my neighbour in the lovely homestay where I am lodging, and James and Dominique, from NZ and France, all with years of being on the road around the world with lots of stories and tips. We hired a car at a ridiculous price (times are not good in Bali) and went up to the rim of the volcano, Mt. Batur and the lake beside.

      "bodyText": "So at last I have left Malaysia. I re-entered Singapore to fly to Bali through the 'back door' - by train from Kuala Lumpur. Anyone who has been in Singapore airport will know that it epitomises the country, flash, efficient, air-con, expensive shops. By contrast the railway station is scruffy, not many facilities and a roadside-type canteen. This puzzled me until I was told that all Singaporeans fly and in fact the station belongs to Malaysia. I returned briefly to my nephew's to pick up a few things. I had bought a sports bag for those times when I go off for just a few days, and somehow this has become full as well. I haven't bought much - only another pair of shorts, two T-shirts, a pair of flip flops, a second novel, and a few toilet rolls - this was a mistake as I asked for one in a market and was sold one pack of 12. I've taken the middles out and did abandon some. . . perhaps I am beginning to see how I have filled another bag. Oh and I forgot the dozen hotel soaps. With all my bags I arrived in Bali at 1am. Despite all the warnings from emailers I stayed in Kuta that night as it was so near. Having had a few late nights and not getting to bed that night until after 2am, I got the shock of my life when I woke the next day to find it was 2pm. The staff were polite enough to laugh when I asked if it was too late for breakfast. A wander through Kuta, crowded with touts, bronzed surfers, and pink Europeans led me straight to the travel office to book a ticket to Ubud, where I am now. Still fairly touristy, Ubud is much more laid back than Kuta with far fewer touts. Wandering around the shops full of paintings, wood carvings, batik and knick-knacks can fill many an hour. There is a dance show every evening and I went to see the Larong dance, the more formal court dancing with wonderful costumes. It was great. I met up with American Ed, my neighbour in the lovely homestay where I am lodging, and James and Dominique, from NZ and France, all with years of being on the road around the world with lots of stories and tips. We hired a car at a ridiculous price (times are not good in Bali) and went up to the rim of the volcano, Mt. Batur and the lake beside. We were just in time to admire the view before the clouds came over and it rained. The touts here were terrible, pulling at your arm and even shouting through the door of the restaurant. We found a deserted road that skirted the lake through a layer of solidified lava. Feeling free of sellers we got out of the car to enjoy the views at leisure.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair staked out his general election foreign policy stance against the Tories yesterday, claiming that Britain could have \"the best of both worlds\" as a trusted North American ally and as a committed part of the EU, and calling for renewed free trade links across the Atlantic. In an address to both houses of the Canadian parliament in Ottawa, Mr Blair said he rejected \"point blank\" the claim among some Tories that the UK had to make a choice between Europe and America. But Mr Blair also pinched one of William Hague's favourite lines by proposing closer links between the EU and the North Atlantic free trade association (Nafta) in a fresh drive towards global free trade. Mr Blair will face the toughest test of his self-appointed role as transatlantic foreign policy middle man when he flies to Camp David today for his first meeting with President George Bush. The controversial US national missile defence project will be top of his agenda. As the prime minister left Ottawa last night for Washington, aides to the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, sought to calm speculation that Mr Bush may be ready to back off on NMD in the face of EU, Russian and Chinese concern. Mr Chr\u00e9tien told the Cana dian House of Commons on Wednesday that the Bush administration had \"decided they will not proceed if it will cause a lot of problems for Nato and if they cannot find an arrangement with the Chinese and the Russians\". But Mr Chr\u00e9tien stepped back from those remarks yesterday at a press conference with Mr Blair, saying NMD was a military decision which would be taken by Washington. Mr Chr\u00e9tien's aides said it would \"absolutely wrong\" to claim the Canadian leader had received any kind of a promise from Washington that the US might not proceed with NMD. Mr Blair prepared for today's Camp David summit with Mr Bush by burnishing his credentials as an Atlanticist and by taking a calculated pre-election swipe at Tory party and rightwing press claims that Britain faced a choice of alliances between Europe and North America. \"We will have the best of both worlds. We will give up neither relationship. We will make them both work,\" Mr Blair said in his speech. The prime minister said he was \"a committed Atlanticist\" but also a European, \"unshakeable in my view that Britain's future is as a leading player in Europe, a force for good, and a force for reform inside the EU\". \"There are those in my country who say it is not possible to be all those things. You can have Europe, or you can have North America, but you cannot have both and that Britain has to choose,\" Mr Blair told the Canadian MPs. \"It is an article of my political faith that I refuse point blank to do so.\" His audience cheered as Mr Blair twice dipped into French as part of his address to the bilingual parliament. Though Mr Blair's speech contained a robust defence of the European defence initiative, an issue which is likely to cause rocky passages when he gets to Camp David, Downing Street was keen to draw attention to the section on Nafta, in which Mr Blair appeared to pull off a classic New Labour manoeuvre by adopting a Tory issue as his own. Mr Blair said Europe should make new efforts to strengthen the EU-Nafta relationship by aiming to end a series of transatlantic disputes \"over issues like beef and bananas\" before the June EU summit in Gothenberg, Sweden. He said the two sides should agree a \"political declaration of intent\" on trade and aim for \"duty free and quota free access for everything but arms\". \"It's time we started to argue vigorously and clearly for free trade,\" Mr Blair said. \"The case against it is misguided and, worse, unfair.

      "body": "<p>Despite the polls William Hague's aides insist that he is convinced he can pull off a surprise victory.</p> <p>While virtually the entire shadow cabinet have resigned themselves to a Labour victory, the Tory leader has adopted a Panglossian optimism regardless of the circumstances.</p> <p>He and the party chairman, Michael Ancram, the only two senior Tories who believe they are heading for Downing Street, pin their hopes on 2.5m swing voters in 180 seats they believe could deliver them victory. Three factors will convince the so called middle income \"pebbledash\" voters to embrace the Tories.</p> <p>First, the opinion polls disguise widespread anger with the government for being arrogant and out of touch. Second, Michael Portillo's tax cuts, carefully aimed at middle income earners, will appeal on the doorstep. Third, the Keep the Pound campaign will play well with the majority of voters who are opposed to the single currency.</p> <p>So the theory goes. By the time the election is called, the Tories will have delivered their message to more than half of their target voters through a call centre at Central Office. So far, 1.25m voters have been contacted, and all 2.5m voters in the target seats have been sent a mailshot.</p> <p>The 180 seats have been graded to avoid wasting resources in seats where the Tories already stand a good chance or in seats where they will struggle.</p> <p>John Flack, the amiable rightwinger who hopes to win back Mr Portillo's old seat of Enfield Southgate in north London, admits that he is likely to be left to his own devices. His seat, 23rd on the list, would return to the Tory fold on a swing of 1.55%. A little further down the list, Michael Simpson can expect shadow cabinet visits in Putney in south London, where he needs a swing of 3.4%.</p> <p>One Tory MP said yesterday that he could not understand the polls, because the hostile reception he received on the doorsteps in 1997 had been replaced by a genuine warmth. The MP, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"No one believes that we will win the election - Tony Blair would have to commit a serious crime for that to happen. But today's polls, which I believed in 1997, do not reflect the view on the streets. People who abandoned us in 1997 are coming back.\"</p> <p>Another Tory said that a rural/urban split could explain the dire polls. \"We are in real trouble in urban areas - I see no signs of a recovery in London,\" the source said. \"But we could do well in rural seats where on paper we do not stand a chance.\"</p> <p>Once the election is called an efficient \"war room\" at Central Office, staffed by 60 press officers and researchers, starts work. However, on the ground the Tories are dangerously short of activists. In 1979, when Margaret Thatcher first won, they had more than 12,000 councillors, the backbone of a campaign. This figure has nearly halved.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite the polls William Hague's aides insist that he is convinced he can pull off a surprise victory. While virtually the entire shadow cabinet have resigned themselves to a Labour victory, the Tory leader has adopted a Panglossian optimism regardless of the circumstances. He and the party chairman, Michael Ancram, the only two senior Tories who believe they are heading for Downing Street, pin their hopes on 2.5m swing voters in 180 seats they believe could deliver them victory. Three factors will convince the so called middle income \"pebbledash\" voters to embrace the Tories. First, the opinion polls disguise widespread anger with the government for being arrogant and out of touch. Second, Michael Portillo's tax cuts, carefully aimed at middle income earners, will appeal on the doorstep. Third, the Keep the Pound campaign will play well with the majority of voters who are opposed to the single currency. So the theory goes. By the time the election is called, the Tories will have delivered their message to more than half of their target voters through a call centre at Central Office. So far, 1.25m voters have been contacted, and all 2.5m voters in the target seats have been sent a mailshot. The 180 seats have been graded to avoid wasting resources in seats where the Tories already stand a good chance or in seats where they will struggle. John Flack, the amiable rightwinger who hopes to win back Mr Portillo's old seat of Enfield Southgate in north London, admits that he is likely to be left to his own devices. His seat, 23rd on the list, would return to the Tory fold on a swing of 1.55%. A little further down the list, Michael Simpson can expect shadow cabinet visits in Putney in south London, where he needs a swing of 3.4%. One Tory MP said yesterday that he could not understand the polls, because the hostile reception he received on the doorsteps in 1997 had been replaced by a genuine warmth. The MP, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"No one believes that we will win the election - Tony Blair would have to commit a serious crime for that to happen. But today's polls, which I believed in 1997, do not reflect the view on the streets. People who abandoned us in 1997 are coming back.\" Another Tory said that a rural/urban split could explain the dire polls. \"We are in real trouble in urban areas - I see no signs of a recovery in London,\" the source said. \"But we could do well in rural seats where on paper we do not stand a chance.\" Once the election is called an efficient \"war room\" at Central Office, staffed by 60 press officers and researchers, starts work. However, on the ground the Tories are dangerously short of activists. In 1979, when Margaret Thatcher first won, they had more than 12,000 councillors, the backbone of a campaign. This figure has nearly halved.",

A spokeswoman for the Department for Education and Employment said: \"Tuition fees are uprated annually in line with inflation and the government is putting a record \u00a31.7bn into higher education.\" The vice-chancellors meet in Newcastle next week to discuss the report but are unlikely to decide which option to go for.

In a direct challenge to education secretary David Blunkett, who has ruled out top-up fees during a second Labour term, university vice-chancellors have refused to discard them as a future option and remain convinced that a future government will allow universities to charge extra. The introduction of market fees allowing prestigious universities - or popular courses like law and medicine - to increase tuition charges to students is one of four options outlined by Universities UK in a paper published today. Sir Howard Newby, president of Universities UK, formerly the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, refused to rule out a post-election change of heart by the government on the matter. \"Ministers come and go.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After \"How was the Versace party?\" the question most people want to ask about London Fashion Week is \"Why are the clothes so weird?\" You might well ask. No other city has sent down the catwalk quite so many dresses that bare at least one breast. No other city would have embraced with such abandon a trend as profit-destroyingly unflattering as drainpipe trousers. Why, indeed. </p> <p>In fact, London has done contrarily well out of cornering the niche market in Weird Clothes. In 1994 there were 15 shows on the London fashion week schedule; now there are 52. Apart from Burberry, very few British brands command power in the marketplace with their advertising spend; instead, they have to rely on grabbing the audience's attention by any means necessary. And if the industry has an inbuilt lean towards an art-school mentality, it may have something to do with the fact that out of the 52 designers on the schedule, 26 are graduates of one particular, highly experimental college: St Martins. </p> <p>However, while London's creativity attracts attention and acclaim, this doesn't always translate into healthy businesses, as Hussein Chalayan's problems demonstrate. But maybe, just maybe, things are about to change. The first signs of a new spirit of maturity seemed to be emerging during this London fashion week. The most exciting designers are those who have a broad enough intelligence both to express their creativity and to take up the challenge of producing pieces that work as clothes - and their number seems to be increasing. </p> <p>Alexander McQueen has all the trappings of an experimental designer. Vivid, theatrical storytelling on the catwalk, showpiece accessories such as feather headdresses and gold dog skeletons, and a penchant for undiplomatic plain-speaking in public. But the clothes that will be on the rails come September are far from clownish. Instead, they have a subtle kind of drama: a double-breasted avocado green trouser suit has a waist seam curving in a gentle spiral around the body; a belted leather coat is detailed with scalloped layers, like fishscales; a halterneck evening dress in black satin has a wide neck cuff with long, trailing ties. </p> <p>Elegant tailoring with a sense of theatre was also the mood at another highlight of the week, the Markus Lupfer show. Softer than last season but still with bite, the collection featured shell pink leather separates, elegant trouser suits and airbrushed printed silk in painterly colours of egg yolk yellow, scarlet, electric blue and emerald green. </p> <p>Matthew Williamson's \"Wonderland\" had some magic moments: gently curved skirts in panelled opaque and sheer glittering ivory lace, and feather straps on a pale column dress. Elspeth Gibson's collection was also delicious: try a tartan mini with rose-pink lace petticoats (yes, minis are definitely back), a cream cashmere cardigan with diamant\u00e9-sprinkled net, or a cocktail dress in black spotted net over a nude slip. The return of the Proper Cocktail Frock was a theme of the week. At Boyd, where the tone was more sophisticated than last season, a stunning black lace dress had asymmetric straps - one spaghetti-thin, one thick ribbon - and an aubergine slip beneath. </p> <p>Tracey Boyd also showed some of the season's best coats: tailored and neat in glittered lilac tweed (tweed has gone luxe for next season), or long and luscious in raspberry sheepskin. Even Julien Macdonald, king of teeny-tiny spangly frocks, showed hints of the new maturity: Helena Christiansen looked absurdly gorgeous in a black satin dress with slices of sheer black lace at the hip. </p> <p>Clements Ribeiro revived one of their best-loved themes with polka-dot charcoal sweater dresses (sweater dresses look set for a revival) and sweet pale chiffon dresses with uneven, raggedy hems, reminiscent of a ballet school fallen on hard times. Scott Henshall was impressive, with crossword-printed silk separates and elegant, cruise-style pale knitwear. Sheila Maloney developed her distinctive, quirky style with trademark curving skirt hems, dresses decorated with outsize sequins in the shape of deer, and intricate glitter pouches giving movement and shimmer. Marcus Constable also featured dip-and-soar hems, in skirts of layered gold-and-silver taffeta. </p> <p>Mulligan's was a strong collection, with black crepe tailoring lined with rose pink silk, sparkle-sprinkled tweed coats, and spraypaint squiggles (a summer trend that looks set to carry through) in pistachio on a chocolate leather skirt. Preen was impressive, with charming Elizabethan-esque puffed and pointed shoulder shapes, and wing-shaped pocket flaps on very nicely cut trousers. </p> <p>Talented newcomer Hamish Morrow showcased his ability to make sculptural shapes work on the body, with tailored and frothed glitter wool column dresses and black lace. Jeans were daubed and splashed Jackson Pollock-style with liberal quantities of pink and turquoise paint. </p> <p>With a mighty international fashion business up and running, Paul Smith doesn't need to prove to anyone that he is a grown-up. Instead he had some fun with tongue-in-cheek Aspen glamour: coffee lace cocktail dresses, scarf-print shirt dresses and gorgeous sweetie-coloured coats. </p> <p>Nicole Farhi's restrained elegance was perfectly aimed at her loyal customer base: understated soft leather tailoring for day, tuxedo-style bugle-beaded black separates for evening. John Rocha made interesting shapes wearable, with the tiniest of puff sleeves and softly gathered demi-puffball skirts, while Betty Jackson's sharp patchwork separates of bright silks and ribbon-cut coffee skirt were upbeat and eye-catching. </p> <p>Ben de Lisi, as always, excelled in long, fluid evening dresses, this season in raspberry satin and liquid-soft white sequins.

      "bodyText": "After \"How was the Versace party?\" the question most people want to ask about London Fashion Week is \"Why are the clothes so weird?\" You might well ask. No other city has sent down the catwalk quite so many dresses that bare at least one breast. No other city would have embraced with such abandon a trend as profit-destroyingly unflattering as drainpipe trousers. Why, indeed. In fact, London has done contrarily well out of cornering the niche market in Weird Clothes. In 1994 there were 15 shows on the London fashion week schedule; now there are 52. Apart from Burberry, very few British brands command power in the marketplace with their advertising spend; instead, they have to rely on grabbing the audience's attention by any means necessary. And if the industry has an inbuilt lean towards an art-school mentality, it may have something to do with the fact that out of the 52 designers on the schedule, 26 are graduates of one particular, highly experimental college: St Martins. However, while London's creativity attracts attention and acclaim, this doesn't always translate into healthy businesses, as Hussein Chalayan's problems demonstrate. But maybe, just maybe, things are about to change. The first signs of a new spirit of maturity seemed to be emerging during this London fashion week. The most exciting designers are those who have a broad enough intelligence both to express their creativity and to take up the challenge of producing pieces that work as clothes - and their number seems to be increasing. Alexander McQueen has all the trappings of an experimental designer. Vivid, theatrical storytelling on the catwalk, showpiece accessories such as feather headdresses and gold dog skeletons, and a penchant for undiplomatic plain-speaking in public. But the clothes that will be on the rails come September are far from clownish. Instead, they have a subtle kind of drama: a double-breasted avocado green trouser suit has a waist seam curving in a gentle spiral around the body; a belted leather coat is detailed with scalloped layers, like fishscales; a halterneck evening dress in black satin has a wide neck cuff with long, trailing ties. Elegant tailoring with a sense of theatre was also the mood at another highlight of the week, the Markus Lupfer show. Softer than last season but still with bite, the collection featured shell pink leather separates, elegant trouser suits and airbrushed printed silk in painterly colours of egg yolk yellow, scarlet, electric blue and emerald green. Matthew Williamson's \"Wonderland\" had some magic moments: gently curved skirts in panelled opaque and sheer glittering ivory lace, and feather straps on a pale column dress. Elspeth Gibson's collection was also delicious: try a tartan mini with rose-pink lace petticoats (yes, minis are definitely back), a cream cashmere cardigan with diamant\u00e9-sprinkled net, or a cocktail dress in black spotted net over a nude slip. The return of the Proper Cocktail Frock was a theme of the week. At Boyd, where the tone was more sophisticated than last season, a stunning black lace dress had asymmetric straps - one spaghetti-thin, one thick ribbon - and an aubergine slip beneath. Tracey Boyd also showed some of the season's best coats: tailored and neat in glittered lilac tweed (tweed has gone luxe for next season), or long and luscious in raspberry sheepskin. Even Julien Macdonald, king of teeny-tiny spangly frocks, showed hints of the new maturity: Helena Christiansen looked absurdly gorgeous in a black satin dress with slices of sheer black lace at the hip. Clements Ribeiro revived one of their best-loved themes with polka-dot charcoal sweater dresses (sweater dresses look set for a revival) and sweet pale chiffon dresses with uneven, raggedy hems, reminiscent of a ballet school fallen on hard times. Scott Henshall was impressive, with crossword-printed silk separates and elegant, cruise-style pale knitwear. Sheila Maloney developed her distinctive, quirky style with trademark curving skirt hems, dresses decorated with outsize sequins in the shape of deer, and intricate glitter pouches giving movement and shimmer. Marcus Constable also featured dip-and-soar hems, in skirts of layered gold-and-silver taffeta. Mulligan's was a strong collection, with black crepe tailoring lined with rose pink silk, sparkle-sprinkled tweed coats, and spraypaint squiggles (a summer trend that looks set to carry through) in pistachio on a chocolate leather skirt. Preen was impressive, with charming Elizabethan-esque puffed and pointed shoulder shapes, and wing-shaped pocket flaps on very nicely cut trousers. Talented newcomer Hamish Morrow showcased his ability to make sculptural shapes work on the body, with tailored and frothed glitter wool column dresses and black lace. Jeans were daubed and splashed Jackson Pollock-style with liberal quantities of pink and turquoise paint. With a mighty international fashion business up and running, Paul Smith doesn't need to prove to anyone that he is a grown-up. Instead he had some fun with tongue-in-cheek Aspen glamour: coffee lace cocktail dresses, scarf-print shirt dresses and gorgeous sweetie-coloured coats. Nicole Farhi's restrained elegance was perfectly aimed at her loyal customer base: understated soft leather tailoring for day, tuxedo-style bugle-beaded black separates for evening. John Rocha made interesting shapes wearable, with the tiniest of puff sleeves and softly gathered demi-puffball skirts, while Betty Jackson's sharp patchwork separates of bright silks and ribbon-cut coffee skirt were upbeat and eye-catching. Ben de Lisi, as always, excelled in long, fluid evening dresses, this season in raspberry satin and liquid-soft white sequins. And there were also some wonderful collections that had little to do with selling clothes. In particular Russell Sage, reworking antique table linens and vintage pieces and mixing these with new fabric, gave an imaginative and thought-provoking show, while Jessica Ogden's blend of kimono dressing and old-fashioned English prints, enthusiastically staged as a mini one-room play, was original and hugely enjoyable. Which is as it should be: this is London, fashion's capital of ideas, and we want to keep it that way. We just don't want everyone to go bankrupt, that's all.

However, since I shared her with 10 or 11 other children, \"Miss Scott's\", as her home was called, had something of the feeling of a school. </p> <p>From the age of four-and-a-half I was taken by taxi every day from my parents' country house to a semi-detached home in the nearby market town.

I remember something rather gross about it, but let's just say I think he may have taken unnatural pleasure in the experience of having me at the wheel. </p> <p>I always felt rather embarrassed and uncomfortable as I peered out of the windscreen from his lap and when I was dropped off at Miss Scott's gates I would run (my father often said he couldn't stand little girls that skipped) to the front door. </p> <p>There was no uniform, but little girls were instructed to wear dresses. My favourite was a mint green colour in satin cotton with smocking across the chest. I'm not sure what the boys were asked to wear.

My pencil stayed upright, digging into the paper and my handwriting was irredeemably bad. </p> <p>We were taught to read and spell with the aid of boxes of paper letters that must have been 40 years old (my father's governess was probably giving us an entirely pre-war education). You had to copy out sentences from a book in letters on your table. I liked the stories about scarecrows and biscuits and would sneak a glance at the pages ahead. Edwin, who was always having nosebleeds, would be lying on the floor beside me with a damp cloth on his forehead. </p> <p>For lunch we would walk into the centre of town for overcooked beef and jelly trifle at the local cafe, or stay in the house and have a picnic. My nanny sent orange squash in one of my father's hip flasks. There was no playing that I recall. After lunch we would say the Our Father. Catholics and Protestants were clearly differentiated by whether they were allowed to add: \"For thine is the kingdom the power and the glory\", at the end of the prayer. Then we would lie down on a rug on the floor and sleep or read. </p> <p>I read the Roy Rogers Annual as often as I could. I hit Edwin with it once on the top of his head. I sometimes wonder who he was and what happened to him. The children all came from important or aristocratic local families and their fate was often curiously grim. At least four became heroin addicts. As a percentage, this must rank with the grimmest inner-city sink estates. </p> <p>One was the prettiest girl in the school.

My best friend from Miss Scott's had been engaged to him. She lives in a castle now, although she will be divorcing its owner later in the year. Another boy, known as Duncan the Dribbler (for obvious reasons) was killed in a motorcycle accident. I'm not sure that he made his twenties.

That doesn't leave many does it? </p> <p>Miss Scott's chief concern when I left school was that my handwriting shouldn't blacken her reputation locally. Happily for her I was sent on to an enormous French school in London.

      "body": "<p>In a green tent in the grounds of what was once a school, a crayon drawing has been pinned to the wall. It shows a small girl with her arms thrown up in the air. She is running - running away from a shaking house and a row of wobbling green trees. The girl is smiling and yet her actions convey an absolute and Munch-like sense of horror. </p> <p>The picture is one of many done by pupils at Kendriya Vidayala school in Bhuj, the town flattened by last month's devastating earthquake in India's western state of Gujarat, in which 30,000 people - many of them children - died. </p> <p>In relative terms the school did not emerge too badly from the disaster. The building is still standing, though a complete write-off. The classrooms are cracked, the roll of honour hangs wonkily from the wall, and the glass trophy cabinet next to the head's office is full of toppled shields and prize cups. </p> <p>But most of the 641 children who used to come here for lessons survived. They were not, as elsewhere, buried along with their teachers beneath an enfolding torrent of rubble. </p> <p>\"It is very necessary to divert the students' minds. They have witnessed so many horrible scenes,\" the school's head, K N Mishra, said yesterday, speaking from the tent which is now his temporary office. \"Education is the only means to do this.\" </p> <p>And so two weeks after the catastrophe on January 26, a group of soldiers began erecting a series of khaki tents along the driveway that leads to the school's entrance, inside an army cantonment. </p> <p>Gradually, the children came trickling back. At the end of last week 116 had returned for classes on plastic sheets strewn with leaves. Desks have been salvaged. New parents are even seeking to enrol their five-year-olds after an advert for the school appeared in the local paper. </p> <p>The younger children are still doing drawings of the quake, while the older ones wrestle with maths exams and English comprehension. Yesterday they were working on a translation of Chekhov. </p> <p>\"It isn't hard for me to study. But it is hard for students who have lost their parents or are mentally disturbed. They are not mentally ready,\" 15-year-old Hitesh Soni said. \"My uncle died in the earthquake. So did my sister's brother-in-law and my aunt's porter,\" he added. </p> <p>Other students recall the moment the tremors started. \"We were on stage in front of the school singing the national anthem. Everyone ran away,\" Shahed Sumra, also 15, said. </p> <p>Of all the imperatives that have emerged from the aftermath of the earthquake - medicines, shelter and warm clothing, for example - one of the greatest, perhaps, is the need for education. </p> <p>Across the barren province of Kutch, which was almost completely destroyed, some 15,000 schools have been affected. Some have suffered only cracks; others have disappeared. </p> <p>\"We are talking about 1.8m children who have lost the two safe places in their lives - schools and homes,\" Maria Calivis, Unicef's head in India, said. \"Their future is filled with uncertainty and fear. The lesson from other earthquakes is that the best way of establishing normality is to get kids back to school.\" </p> <p>Getting children back to school is, however, an unsure business. In Bhuj, only two schools have so far reopened - Kendriya Vidayala and the Army School are both run by the military, one of India's most dependable institutions. </p> <p>In the shattered villages in Kutch's interior, a handful of other \"tent\" schools started last week, some made out of little more than old bedsheets and bamboo poles. But the problems lying ahead are immense. </p> <p>Many teachers were killed in the earthquake or have since fled. In one of the worst affected towns, Anjar, an entire school of 300 children and staff was wiped out. In Bhachau, which was also obliterated, 78 girls died when they were buried inside their school building. </p> <p>And in the village of Adhoi a parade of girls celebrating India's Republic Day were entombed in the main street. Many of those who died were simply too slow to flee - a category that includes the enfeebled old and the very young. </p> <p>Officials in Gujarat have set a date of April 1 for schools to be reopened, but they recognise that the process of rebuilding will take years. </p> <p>Already, though, there is a determination that education should continue - and a recognition that without it there can be no development. </p> <p>\"We are getting them rehearsed for their exams. We are giving them trial papers,\" Ravi Bhatt, the army officer in Bhuj in charge of education, said of the older children who had come back to school. \"We can't allow them to keep mourning. You have to start somewhere.\" </p> <p>At Bhuj's Army School the noticeboard has not been changed since the morning of the earthquake. \"Army School celebrates 51st Republic Day in high spirits,\" it reads. </p> <p>The school building still stands but is dangerous and will have to be demolished. Lessons are being carried out here, as elsewhere, in the school grounds in an ever-multiplying series of tents. </p> <p>\"One of our boys has lost his father,\" the headteacher, Geeta Soni, said yesterday. \"We are trying to find out what happened. Otherwise we have been very fortunate. All our teachers are safe. </p> <p><strong> Youthful resilience</strong><br> </p> <p> \"The problem is not with the teenage children but with the small kids who have the feeling that it [the earthquake] might happen again,\" she added. </p> <p>On the surface, at least, most of the children seem remarkably resilient. In one corner of the grounds, a 13-year-old boy is busy sawing wooden poles in half. Another boy is hitting the ground with a pickaxe, while a third is holding on to some blue plastic sheeting. It takes a while to work out that they are, in fact, building their own classroom. </p> <p>\"They are learning about pitching tents. It is part of their education. Generally they are very happy. It is a change of scene for them. They are enjoying being at school rather than at home,\" their teacher, Devila Gor, explained. </p> <p>Inside the ruined and deserted school building, the classroom walls are still adorned with a series of moral slogans. In earlier days they might have seemed banal. Now, though, they appear apt. </p> <p>\"The good we do today,\" one reads, above a room of fallen masonry, \"becomes the happiness of tomorrow.\"</p>",

Yesterday they were working on a translation of Chekhov. \"It isn't hard for me to study. But it is hard for students who have lost their parents or are mentally disturbed. They are not mentally ready,\" 15-year-old Hitesh Soni said. \"My uncle died in the earthquake. So did my sister's brother-in-law and my aunt's porter,\" he added. Other students recall the moment the tremors started. \"We were on stage in front of the school singing the national anthem. Everyone ran away,\" Shahed Sumra, also 15, said. Of all the imperatives that have emerged from the aftermath of the earthquake - medicines, shelter and warm clothing, for example - one of the greatest, perhaps, is the need for education. Across the barren province of Kutch, which was almost completely destroyed, some 15,000 schools have been affected. Some have suffered only cracks; others have disappeared. \"We are talking about 1.8m children who have lost the two safe places in their lives - schools and homes,\" Maria Calivis, Unicef's head in India, said. \"Their future is filled with uncertainty and fear. The lesson from other earthquakes is that the best way of establishing normality is to get kids back to school.\" Getting children back to school is, however, an unsure business. In Bhuj, only two schools have so far reopened - Kendriya Vidayala and the Army School are both run by the military, one of India's most dependable institutions. In the shattered villages in Kutch's interior, a handful of other \"tent\" schools started last week, some made out of little more than old bedsheets and bamboo poles. But the problems lying ahead are immense. Many teachers were killed in the earthquake or have since fled. In one of the worst affected towns, Anjar, an entire school of 300 children and staff was wiped out. In Bhachau, which was also obliterated, 78 girls died when they were buried inside their school building. And in the village of Adhoi a parade of girls celebrating India's Republic Day were entombed in the main street. Many of those who died were simply too slow to flee - a category that includes the enfeebled old and the very young. Officials in Gujarat have set a date of April 1 for schools to be reopened, but they recognise that the process of rebuilding will take years. Already, though, there is a determination that education should continue - and a recognition that without it there can be no development. \"We are getting them rehearsed for their exams. We are giving them trial papers,\" Ravi Bhatt, the army officer in Bhuj in charge of education, said of the older children who had come back to school. \"We can't allow them to keep mourning. You have to start somewhere.\" At Bhuj's Army School the noticeboard has not been changed since the morning of the earthquake. \"Army School celebrates 51st Republic Day in high spirits,\" it reads. The school building still stands but is dangerous and will have to be demolished. Lessons are being carried out here, as elsewhere, in the school grounds in an ever-multiplying series of tents. \"One of our boys has lost his father,\" the headteacher, Geeta Soni, said yesterday. \"We are trying to find out what happened. Otherwise we have been very fortunate. All our teachers are safe. Youthful resilience \"The problem is not with the teenage children but with the small kids who have the feeling that it [the earthquake] might happen again,\" she added. On the surface, at least, most of the children seem remarkably resilient. In one corner of the grounds, a 13-year-old boy is busy sawing wooden poles in half. Another boy is hitting the ground with a pickaxe, while a third is holding on to some blue plastic sheeting. It takes a while to work out that they are, in fact, building their own classroom. \"They are learning about pitching tents. It is part of their education. Generally they are very happy. It is a change of scene for them. They are enjoying being at school rather than at home,\" their teacher, Devila Gor, explained. Inside the ruined and deserted school building, the classroom walls are still adorned with a series of moral slogans. In earlier days they might have seemed banal. Now, though, they appear apt. \"The good we do today,\" one reads, above a room of fallen masonry, \"becomes the happiness of tomorrow.\"",

      "body": "<p> At 9.30 in the morning, it isn't that unusual to be sorting out your hair and make-up, and so Vivien Solari, a 22-year-old from Manchester, is currently covered in grips and foundation. But Solari isn't doing any of this herself - she has two people for the hair, one for the make-up, someone else for her nails. It is something she will do a lot during the day - stay completely still while others dress her in their imagined ideal. Here, she is being prepared for her first job of the day, a prime role on the catwalk of British label Boyd. </p> <p>Solari, a Vogue covergirl who has modelled since she was 19, is at the epicentre of a tiny room in Fulham Town Hall, the venue for today's show. Around her circle onion-like layers: make-up people, photographers and, on the outskirts, the designer, Tracey Boyd, scurrying in bags as she gets the clothes ready. Solari is oblivious to all this, not because she's precious but because she knows she must keep still so the make-up can be done as quickly and immaculately as possible. </p> <p>Thirty minutes late, once the backstage monitor has been fixed, the show runs without a hitch. The models walk demurely in view of the audience, but behind the scenes it is controlled chaos as they tear around, unzipping their clothes to make it into the next outfit in time. After the final procession, they cheer, clap, strip and leave. </p> <p>Solari is in the midst of a tough few weeks. After eight shows in New York, including Helmut Lang (\"All the girls like his show because he does clothes you might actually want to wear\"), she is in London for a couple of days before the heavyweights in Milan and Paris. Today are shows by Boyd and Clements Ribeiro, designers with similarly accessible collections; yesterday was the entertaining but tiring high glamour of Julien Macdonald; the day before that, the hectic Robert Cary-Williams, whose clothes weren't finished two hours before the show. </p> <p>It has gone midday, but because of a mix-up with her agency's cars, Solari is travelling to her next appointment on the tube. She is made up like a lady of the night, with two beauty spots and highly-styled, tight-curled hair from the Boyd show. \"I think I'm getting some looks,\" she says. </p> <p>She is heading for the Nicole Farhi headquarters off Carnaby Street. Earlier in the week she went for a fitting (the designer tries all the outfits on the model to make sure the clothes match the girl) but Farhi wasn't happy with one of the outfits, so back Solari has to go. She puts on the brown leather jacket that is causing the problem and stands stock still as Farhi and two assistants pull and push at the jacket, talking over her as they do so. </p> <p>They still aren't satisfied, so, even though it will mean visiting the studios a third time for one jacket, Solari agrees to return after Clements Ribeiro. In New York, models are paid by the hour, so designers are more de termined to get the clothes right in one fitting. In London, most shows are done for the prestige, on little or no money, so there are few constraints on what a designer can ask. </p> <p>Are the fittings always that weird? \"You stand there for hours,\" Solari says, \"as they decide how long a sock should be, or if you should wear gloves.\" It seems so impersonal. Does she ever get a say? \"Very rarely. Once, Stella McCartney couldn't work out which outfit to put me in, so she asked what I thought, which was good.\" </p> <p>Solari is going to the fitting for Clements Ribiero via her accountant - she has recently become a limited company to ensure she invests her money wisely. She became a model after dropping out of a psychology degree at Leicester University, but doesn't plan to stay in the industry forever. For the time being, she is having fun and earning enough money to make it worth worrying about. </p> <p>Slowly she is transformed, ending up like someone from The 1940s House. Over on the make-up side of the room, her eyebrows are turned into huge slashes of blue. </p> <p>Then the clothes - David Bowie crossed with 20s-style geometrics - and the designers, Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro, arrive. Solari is briefed on her outfits and struggles into black, studded Manolo Blahnik stilettos, holding on to a rail as if she is trying them on in the middle of a discount sale. It seems the designers are ready to take a risk with the rest. \"They don't want me to try on the clothes, which is a first,\" Solari says. </p> <p>She is grabbed again by the hairdressers, who want to colour her hair with pink powder. An MTV cameraman shoves a microphone in her face and all around photographers come and take more pictures of the girl they had photographed only eight hours before. Throughout it all, Solari looks impassive. </p> <p>When they eventually appear, the clothes in the show are a success and Solari looks great in a leopardprint riding coat and a cute military bomber. But the show is running an hour late and the audience is twitchy to get to the British Fashion Awards. </p> <p>Solari, too, has another engagement, back at Nicole Farhi, devoting yet more of her life to the jacket that, at the next day's show, will be on the catwalk for precisely 30 seconds.

      "bodyText": "For Europe's already traumatised army of consumers the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK will confirm what they have suspected all along - that Britain is a country where the food tastes bad and is tainted by disease. It doesn't matter that foot and mouth cannot be passed to humans via infected meat like mad cow disease for in the minds of consumers perception and fear is everything. Britain, for many on the continent, is rapidly acquiring a reputation as a country which acts as an incubator for some of the world's nastiest animal diseases, and its agricultural credentials have now hit rock bottom. As if to illustrate the point a brave band of souls from the British Meat and Livestock Commission were in France this week for its annual agricultural fair. But they had made the mistake of taking a few sheep along with them to liven up their stand and swiftly found themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to test the animals for foot and mouth disease antibodies. Distrust of the UK's already battered farming industry is at an all time low. First there was BSE, which is now spreading across Europe leaving a trail of fear and paranoia in its wake, and then last summer Britain's pigs were struck down by swine fever forcing the European Commission to slap an export ban on the UK which was only lifted after thousands of animals had been slaughtered. European consumers have been reading about export bans on British meat products for the past five years and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease could be the final nail in the coffin. Dangerous, tainted and diseased are words which, rightly or wrongly, are increasingly associated with British food products and it could take years to dispel the many myths and misunderstandings which live on in people's minds. The UK may have chosen to unilaterally impose its own export ban on animal products after it discovered foot and mouth in Essex but the government also has to contend with an EU-wide export ban from Brussels and many European countries will need firm assurances before they agree to lift it. When the EU's food safety spokeswoman briefed the international press corps on the issue earlier this week she was faced with a barrage of alarmist questions from journalists all over the world demanding cast iron assurances that Britain's problems will not become their problems. \"Can it affect humans?\" asked one Italian journalist. The answer - 'not really' - obviously failed to satisfy many and when the EC admitted that there was a tiny risk of viral infection through close contact between infected animals and older people, children and pregnant women, the alarm bells began to ring. \"Can you catch it by drinking milk?\" asked another and so it went on. One of Britain's most lucrative export markets for animal products - the EU itself - is at stake and the government and the UK farming industry must do everything they can to reassure our European partners that the outbreak is under control. If it does turn out that the source of the infection lies beyond Britain's shores it will undoubtedly be a useful tool in persuading our trading partners that there is nothing endemically tainted about UK food production techniques. But the nightmare scenario, and one which the government must be dreading, is that the highly contagious disease will be carried on the wind, on the soles of tourists' shoes or on the wheels of cars, to continental Europe. If that happened it would be hard to imagine how Britain could ever hope to rebuild its export markets for meat. The challenge facing Britain's beleaguered farmers is tough enough as it is already.

The Ministry of Silly Regulations website was launched by William Hague yesterday. It included the logo of the British Chamber of Commerce in a list of supporters that includes the Conservative party, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry. However, the site had not secured permission to use the logo from the British Chamber of Commerce and was ordered promptly to remove it. \"We have to act quickly and surely on unauthorised uses of our brand,\" said a BCC spokesman. Now the Ministry of Silly Regulations has published a disclaimer saying, \"the organisations shown do not necessarily endorse the views expressed on the Ministry of Silly Regulations\". The website is the brainchild of Sir Paul Judge, former owner of the Premier Brands food business and chairman of the Conservative party's new deregulation group. Sir Paul is also the former boss of Cadbury-Schweppes. The Tory Central Office spokesman would not confirm whether Sir Paul was a member of the Conservative party.

South Lanarkshire's ruling Labour group is calling a special meeting early next week to discuss the issue but a council spokesman said: \"The early indications are that we will be able to stay as Cosla is moving towards what we were looking for. Any decision not to renew our membership has been suspended.\"",

In a tie-up with Vodafone, Ford is to install voice-activated services in its cars. The first in-car telematic services will be offered as an option in the Ford Focus model. But Ford intends to install the systems in all of its cars within five years. The systems operate via Vodafone's mobile telephone network. Initial services include connections to emergency and roadside services, location positioning and rerouting, traffic information and the ability to make phone calls using voice recognition technology. The system will be extended to offer personalised news, stock quotes, weather and messaging. Drivers will be linked to a customisable home page that can be accessed via the internet, enabling drivers to personalise the information and contacts they wish to access in-car. A first range of services will be available in Germany on March 1 followed by a UK launch and a roll out to other countries. The services can be accessed by four buttons on the front panel of the stereo system in the Ford Focus. \"Telematics offer a whole new way to satisfy customers,\" said David Thursfield, president and chief executive of Ford, Europe. \"We are delighted the Focus is the first European Ford to be available with telematic technology. \"We anticipate that, within five years, nearly all new Ford vehicles will be fitted with some type of telematics system,\" said Mr Thursfield. \"Telematics is an integral part of our strategy, delivering information and assistance to our customers wherever they are, even in-car,\" said Thomas Geitner, Vodafone Group chief executive, group products and services.",

The declaration means Ferrari will be in a much better position to negotiate a new contract with superstar racing driver Michael Schumacher, when it comes up for renewal in 2002. Ferrari's sponsorship money helps to pay Schumacher's \u00a320m annual salary. Ferrari confirmed it is to continue its relationship with Marlboro, which dates back to the start of 1984. Marlboro will continue to plaster Ferrarri's racing cars and drivers with the brand's red-and-white livery until the end of the 2006 season. The sponsorship will not be permissible under the EC clampdown on tobacco advertising after 2006. After that date, cigarette advertising will be banned from sport. Reports that Philip Morris was to pull out of its \u00a345m-a-year Marlboro sponsorship deal with Ferrari - in order to release funds for fighting compensation claims from smokers around the world - were slammed by the company.

      "bodyText": "Local authorities are being ordered to launch huge council housing improvement programmes as part of a government bid to help the millions of people who cannot afford to heat their homes in winter. The government today unveiled its strategy to eradicate fuel poverty among pensioners, families with young children, people with disabilities and those suffering long-term illness. About 50,000 pensioners die every year due to cold-related illnesses and many others need hospital treatment. The government aims to end fuel poverty by 2010 with its \u00a31.5bn annual initiative, which will benefit around 3m households, or 4.5m people. It hopes the strategy will also ease pressure on the NHS, which spends around \u00a31bn a year on illnesses linked to fuel poverty. A household is considered to be suffering fuel poverty when more than 10% of disposable income needs to be spent on energy to keep heating at satisfactory levels. Launching the programme, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said: \"It is totally unacceptable that people should ever not have enough money to keep warm and be forced to choose between paying for food or heating their home. \"This problem wears people down and more likely to fall ill, and once makes it harder to recover.\" The measures were a \"win-win\" situation, said Mr Meacher, as they would create jobs through insulation improvement work, while also saving the poor money. The strategy includes: \u0095 Removing 800,000 English households in the private sector from fuel poverty by 2004 through better heating and insulation; \u0095 Bringing a further 400,000 homes in the public sector in England up to decent standards; \u0095 Ensuring Scotland's 140,000 pensioner households and social sector tenants have centrally heated and well insulated homes by 2006; \u0095 Delivering help to 37,000 households in Wales by 2003; \u0095 Targeting 40,000 households in Northern Ireland by 2006. Existing energy efficiency schemes run by central government, local authorities and devolved assemblies will also be coordinated to ensure help is properly targeted at vulnerable people. But the announcement sparked a political row with the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, Don Foster, claiming the government had underestimated the number of vulnerable households - saying the figure should be around 5.3m, rather than the government's 4.5m. And environment group Friends of the Earth accused the government of breaking a pledge to help more people. Spokesman Martyn Williams said the strategy \"failed to live up to\" Labour promises. \"It doesn't even seem to do what is required by law, which is a target for eradicating fuel poverty everywhere, not just vulnerable households,\" he said. \"It looks like the Treasury has forced ministers to do the bare minimum they can get away with but this will leave an awful lot of people still shivering in winter.\"",

But the political health of successive governments has depended on perceptions of the NHS. Unless it is drip-fed above-inflation increases every year, there is hell to pay. Parsimony always results in winter crises, soaring waiting lists and patients on trolleys plastered all over the front pages. It was a lesson of post war political history Labour should not have ignored. </p> <p>For the first two years spending bumped along at the bottom.

Parsimony always results in winter crises, soaring waiting lists and patients on trolleys plastered all over the front pages.

The only activity which distracts them from this is fighting ... The submarine is leaking. The sailors are covering the holes with paint.\"</p> <p>A group of veterans in St Petersburg had been assisting the Canadian production company to research the 1961 disaster, in which 28 sailors died from radiation poisoning after a malfunction on a nuclear reactor in the K-19 submarine.</p> <p>They say they were assured the film, Widowmaker, would focus on the courage of the men on board, especially those who sacrificed their lives to avert a nuclear catastrophe.</p> <p>The arrival of the script triggered outrage. \"It is very insulting,\" said retired Captain Yury Mukhin, one of 90 survivors. \"It portrays us as ill-educated, ill-disciplined and impolite, when in reality K-19 was the most advanced submarine in the Soviet Union, and the navy recruited its best men to serve on board.\"</p> <p>Survivors are dismayed by the portrayal of K-19 as a lump of faulty technology and horrified by the suggestion that crew members would have drunk vodka or played cards on duty. A panic scene after the alarm is sounded, with crew members reaching for the instruction book, made them particularly furious.</p> <p>\"We suspect that the film's idea is to show that Russian submariners were incompetent 40 years ago - and to imply that this is how they are now, in the wake of the Kursk tragedy,\" said Igor Kurdin, head of the St Petersburg Sailors and Submariners Club.</p> <p>A letter has been sent to Russian naval chiefs demanding an end to cooperation with the K-19 Productions film company. An assistant at K-19 Productions said the script had been substantially revised and that the veterans' concerns were groundless.</p> <p>\"Revising it won't help. The film needs to be totally rewritten,\" Capt Kurdin said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Survivors of a Soviet nuclear submarine disaster are campaigning to block the filming of a Hollywood disaster-movie version of their experiences - enraged by a screenplay that portrays them as incompetent drunkards. Initial support for the venture, due to star Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, soured when a group of veterans obtained a draft of the script. \"Everyone is drinking - the officers and the sailors,\" scene-setting directions note. \"They drink heavily and they drink constantly. The only activity which distracts them from this is fighting ... The submarine is leaking. The sailors are covering the holes with paint.\" A group of veterans in St Petersburg had been assisting the Canadian production company to research the 1961 disaster, in which 28 sailors died from radiation poisoning after a malfunction on a nuclear reactor in the K-19 submarine. They say they were assured the film, Widowmaker, would focus on the courage of the men on board, especially those who sacrificed their lives to avert a nuclear catastrophe. The arrival of the script triggered outrage. \"It is very insulting,\" said retired Captain Yury Mukhin, one of 90 survivors. \"It portrays us as ill-educated, ill-disciplined and impolite, when in reality K-19 was the most advanced submarine in the Soviet Union, and the navy recruited its best men to serve on board.\" Survivors are dismayed by the portrayal of K-19 as a lump of faulty technology and horrified by the suggestion that crew members would have drunk vodka or played cards on duty. A panic scene after the alarm is sounded, with crew members reaching for the instruction book, made them particularly furious. \"We suspect that the film's idea is to show that Russian submariners were incompetent 40 years ago - and to imply that this is how they are now, in the wake of the Kursk tragedy,\" said Igor Kurdin, head of the St Petersburg Sailors and Submariners Club. A letter has been sent to Russian naval chiefs demanding an end to cooperation with the K-19 Productions film company. An assistant at K-19 Productions said the script had been substantially revised and that the veterans' concerns were groundless. \"Revising it won't help. The film needs to be totally rewritten,\" Capt Kurdin said.",

      "body": "<p>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, who has died aged 84, was Labour leader in the House of Lords from 1982 to 1992. Earlier, as plain Cledwyn Hughes, he served as a senior figure in the Commons under three Labour leaders - as an opposition spokesman under Hugh Gaitskell, and as a cabinet minister under both Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, most notably as secretary of state for his beloved Wales.</p> <p>Widely popular for his shrewdness and warm personality, he had an unending store of anecdotes, which were imparted with relish in the corridors of Westminster and to audiences in Wales, whether in his native Welsh language or in English.</p> <p>The stories derived from his climb up the political ladder, from Anglesey county council (1946-52) to the Commons backbenches in 1951, through his government posts as minister of state for commonwealth relations, Welsh secretary and minister for agriculture, to his leadership of Labour peers for the decade that ended with the 1992 general election. One of his oft-repeated classics concerned James Callaghan's retort in 1976, when Cledwyn told him the parliamentary Labour party had elected him leader and prime minister: \"And I never even went to university!\"</p> <p>Cledwyn's confidence - and the quality of his anecdotes - grew steadily from the time he arrived at Westminster as a small-town solicitor and the new Labour MP for Anglesey, who had just ousted Lady Megan Lloyd George, daughter of the last Liberal prime minister. His shy clannishness initially only allowed him to eat at the Commons Welsh table and speak, preferably in Welsh, to fellow countrymen from north Wales. More aggressive solicitor-MPs from the bigger practices of south Wales tended to ridicule his parochial timidity.</p> <p>Cledwyn's feelings about north Wales were so strong that, in 1959, he and his wife Jean decided that they did not want their two children brought up as Anglo-Welsh mongrels in London's English-language culture. Jean returned to north Wales, converting Cledwyn into a train-wearied weekend husband.</p> <p>His initial timidity derived partly from the large red birthmark on his face, and partly from the womb of Welsh culture - that combination of chapel and north Wales Liberalism - into which he was born in Holyhead, on the isle of Anglesey. He was doubly embedded as the son of a respected Presbyterian minister and leader of the local Liberals, the Rev David Hughes, himself the son of a Snowdonia quarryman.</p> <p>But young Cledwyn did well at Holyhead grammar school and went on to read law at the University of Wales at Aberystwyth, which then had only 750 students, almost all of them Welsh. He became president of the university Liberal society.</p> <p>In 1937, he returned to Holyhead to be articled to a local solicitor. As local unemployment deepened, and the Czechoslovak crisis intensified, he listened to local Independent Labour party speakers - and joined the Labour party in 1938.</p> <p>Called up in 1940, he served in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve until 1945, doing administrative, legal and intelligence jobs, and was commissioned as a flight lieutenant, without being able to fly. In 1944, local Labour stalwarts urged him to stand in the impending general election against Lady Megan, but his father resisted. Cledwyn fought the 1945 election almost on his own, making 50 speeches - 45 of them in Welsh. Nonetheless, he came within 1,000 votes of victory.</p> <p>Back in Holyhead after demobilisation, he opened his own legal practice. In court, he defended clients with unexpected fierceness and, by 1949, his position had improved enough for him to marry the lovely Jean Hughes, who had the same surname, the same religion and the same politics.</p> <p>Cledwyn's political advance looked less hopeful. In 1946, he had been elected to Anglesey county council, but when he challenged Lady Megan again in 1950, she beat him by 2,000 votes, largely because, although a Liberal, she had identified with Labour. In 1951, however, when Labour was receding nationally, he ousted the crown princess of the Lloyd George Liberals by 595 votes.</p> <p>Cledwyn made a diffident start, unsure that he would survive beyond one term at Westminster. Initially, he left Jean behind in Holyhead with their infant daughter, Ann. In the Commons, he became a fringe Bevanite, largely because he liked Aneurin Bevan (though not his wife, Jennie Lee). In 1955, with a number of other Welsh-speaking Labour MPs, he urged devolution for Wales. The following year, they started a petition for a Welsh parliament, for which rebelliousness Cledwyn was reported to the Labour national executive by the south-Wales-dominated Welsh Council of Labour.</p> <p>Thanks to his battle to bring jobs to the constituency, in 1955 he was returned by a comfortable 4,568 votes, and brought Jean, Ann and son Harri down to London. He helped to bring the Wylfa nuclear power station to Anglesey, and subsequently get an aluminium smelter project in the area. He knew unemployment forced Welsh-speaking locals to emigrate and lose their Welsh culture.</p> <p>Cledwyn began his rise in 1959, when Gaitskell made him an assistant spokesman on housing and local government. When Harold Wilson led Labour to victory in 1964, he became minister of state for commonwealth relations, with African troubles on his plate. In 1966, he became secretary of state for Wales.</p> <p>A firm believer in Wales as a nation entitled to its own parliament, he faced the problem that four-fifths of Welshmen lived in non-Welsh-speaking south Wales and did not share his aspirations. His two years in the job were spent in building Wales's economic base and civil service, disappointing nationalists and Welsh-language fanatics. \"Language is a thing you cannot push down people's throats,\" he told those who shouted \"Traitor! traitor!\" at him at the eisteddfod.</p> <p>In 1968, Wilson made him minister for agriculture, partly to get rid of Fred Peart, who was a fanatically anti-common marketeer, partly to promote another Wilson loyalist, George Thomas (later Viscount Tonypandy) to the cabinet, thus giving south Wales its due voice in the Welsh Office. At agriculture, Cledwyn could not compete with Peart as a trencherman. But he became a moderate pro-marketeer and a great admirer of Roy Jenkins, an uprooted South Walian - although he stopped short of following Roy into the Social Democratic party.</p> <p>As a capable administrator, Cledwyn did not enjoy Labour's period in opposition from 1970 to 1974. When the party returned to power, he became chairman of the parliamentary Labour party 1974-79, a job well suited to his ability to nudge most people into loyalty. As Jim Callaghan's envoy to southern Africa at the end of 1978, he tried, unsuccessfully, to accelerate the handover of power in Rhodesia. In 1979, he stepped down from the Anglesey seat, and was made a life peer.</p> <p>His greatest test was his decade as Labour leader in the Lords, which began by ousting a disintegrating Peart. He had 120-130 ageing peers, only two-thirds well enough to vote regularly. It was an arduous task to put up a creditable show against at least three times as many Tories, both declared and undeclared, backed by the civil service. It was a disappointment that his time was not capped by a Labour victory in 1992, which would have allowed him to reform the institution. He had the compensation, however, of handing over to another Welshman, Lord (Ivor) Richard, even if he was from south Wales.</p> <p>Lord Cledwyn is survived by his wife and two children.</p> <p><b>Lord Callaghan of Cardiff writes</b><br><br> I am deeply sad to learn of Cledwyn's passing. As secretary of state for Wales, he was an outstanding leader. His concern was for all aspects of Welsh life - its political and economic advancement, its culture, the language, and the progress of the university of which he was so proud to be pro-chancellor.</p> <p>In international affairs, he was a true statesman; as a member of a small nation, he had an instinctive understanding of the small nations of the Commonwealth. As minister for commonwealth affairs, he earned a wide reputation in Britain's overseas territories for his interest, his creative mind and his humanity. As Labour leader in the Lords, despite depleted numbers, he organised a most effective opposition and won the respect of all parties in the House.</p> <p>He was an unfailing counsellor to me throughout my political life, and especially during my time as prime minister. Wales has lost a great man, and I mourn a true friend.</p> <p>\u0095 Cledwyn Hughes, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, Baron of Holyhead in the Isle of Anglesey, politician, born September 14 1916; died February 22 2001.</p>",

However, she has now been engaged by Unesco and the book publishing industry to promote World Book Day 2001. Posters featuring celebrities and their favourite books will appear across the country, supported by a radio advertising campaign designed to whip up interest ahead of World Book Day on March 1. The campaign was inspired by a similar initiative in the US that featured stars such as Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell. Ms Lawson named the Raymond Chandler Papers, edited by Tom Hiney and Frank MacShane, her favourite book. Her fellow TV chef and cookery writer Jamie Oliver opted for Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years. Actor Ioan Gruffudd, who played TV's Hornblower, chose Omega by Geraint Jones.

But car advertising is not giving consumers what they want. Motor marketeers and their advertising agencies are committing the sin of ignoring the needs of their target audience, according to Edmund King, RAC Foundation chief executive. And car manufacturers are losing sales as a result. In a new survey, the independent body has found just 3% of car ads in newspapers and magazines concentrate on safety features. In contrast, 8% of press ads focused on safety 18 months ago. \"Consumers are always most concerned about the safety of cars but manufacturers are not selling it,\" explained Mr King. \"A new European crash-test programme is now in place but most manufacturers do not make use of the results in their ads. \"There are some exceptions - Renault, for example - but we feel ads are not giving consumers what they want, which is weird when you're trying to sell a product,\" he added. He called for simpler ads containing the basic information about safety, efficiency and economic viability. The survey revealed ads have shifted to focus on finance deals - with 29% of press ads promoting special offers. Some 26% of ads focused on gadgets, 14% concentrated on speed, 12% promoted cheap insurance and breakdown cover and 8% tried to sell a lifestyle concept. In a bizarre reversal of the old advertising adage \"sex sells\", only 6% of ads highlighted the sexiness of the cars. Although far removed from the \"bikini-clad babes languishing on bonnets\" approach prevalent in the 60s and 70s, Mr King said the last 12 months have witnessed an increase in the use of sex to sell cars. He pointed to a Mercedes-Benz advert in this week's press. It uses the line: \"She takes my breath away... the way she moves... sleekly turns the road to silk... the way she purrs...\" and ends: \"She's worth it.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Lot 100: the 8ft hamster</strong> </p> <p>Roberts approaches the fibreglass rodent and confidently dodging the \"is it a mouse/is it a hamster?\" debate, simply identifies it as a \"monument to bad taste\". The rodent once stood in the Work Zone. To the right of its paw is a block of yellow, fibreglass cheese. \"It's a mouse, with some cheese,\" says Roberts slowly, turning it over in his mind. Within seconds, he has identified a possible buyer. \"A theme pub will buy that and hang it out of their first-floor window because they've got a cheese board,\" he says. Roberts thinks they'll pay in the region of \u00a3350, although is at pains to point out that with two tasteless bidders in the room, you never know how high these things will go. </p> <p><strong> Lot 103: the central nervous system</strong> </p> <p>Roberts's eye is caught by a sliver of brain, pancreas and two dismembered feet suspended, Damien Hirst-style, within a block of Perspex. Beside them hangs a human nervous system. \"They're plastic, I think,\" says Roberts, suddenly doubtful of how far into tastelessness the organisers have strayed. He picks up a model of a human eye, the size of a hub cap. \"This would make a wonderful mirror in someone's big loft apartment.\" Two prospective buyers can later be overheard discussing the merits of \"body-part art\", while a nearby dome steward sniggers into her neon vest. </p> <p><strong> Lot 650: the oversized clock and other miscellany</strong> </p> <p>Getting into his stride now, Roberts considers a table of assorted tat - boardgames, shuttlecocks, a rubber chicken - and reflects on life's ironies. \"It's common,\" he says, waving an arm to take in the spread, \"but without the common touch. That's where the dome went wrong.\" </p> <p>A giant clockface stands before him, imprinted with the legend: \"the average person works 100,000 hours during their lifetime.\" It used to stand in the Work Zone. After observing what a shame it is that more hours weren't put into finding an imaginative way to deliver the statistic, Roberts says that the clock will find a home in the atrium of a big accountancy firm and could go for anything up to \u00a3300. </p> <p><strong> Lot 91: the mannequin</strong> </p> <p>\"God,\" says Roberts, \"he'll never make it in window dressing.\" We are standing before a life-size doll, a man in a boilersuit grimacing as if he knows where he is. Roberts is quite taken and moves in closer. \"The Beamish Museum might be interested in him. They could use him as an engineer on the Flying Scotsman.\" He puts its value between \u00a3160 and \u00a3220. </p> <p>A dummy of a disconsolate England supporter is less well received. \"He looks more of a heroin addict than a football fan,\" sniffs Roberts. \"In fact, he doesn't look like a fan of anything.\" He declines to put a price on him. </p> <p><strong> Lot 84: the sculpture</strong> </p> <p>Warming to his disgruntlement, Roberts rounds on a collection of Tony Hart/Womble style sculptures made from things other folk have thrown away. There is a bicycle built from bits of old sports equipment and a harp cobbled together from instruments. It is the model of a three-piece suit fashioned from old magazines, however, that provokes Roberts's outrage. </p> <p>\"It could go for \u00a320, it could go for \u00a3200,\" he says, shrugging helplessly at the vast irresponsibility of people with too much disposable income. \"It's Hannibal Lecter stuff,\" he rails. \"I mean, was the person who made this in an asylum? Your aunty might call it surrealism, but we both know what I would call it.\" I usher him into the nearest side room, realising too late that it's bare but for a row of hamster wheels, each occupied by a stuffed rodent. </p> <p><strong> Lot 236: the rodents</strong> </p> <p>Unexpectedly, Roberts goes for the rodents. \"Nicholas Serota stuff, this,\" he says happily. \"I mean, you'll get pet owners bidding for the cages - I'd say \u00a3200 for a row of 20 - but the best place for this lot is Tate Modern.\" It is unclear whether Roberts is praising the rat installation or condemning modern art. </p> <p><strong> Lot 957: the costumes</strong> </p> <p>Second-hand fleeces, nurses uniforms, air steward outfits - it is like the BBC wardrobe department in here, but Roberts thinks the Work Zone's costumes have wider potential. \"A club will open up in nine years time called the Millennium Experience and all this stuff will be at the cutting edge of fashion.\" He pulls at the corner of a sludge-green dress. \"You'll have to keep it in the cupboard until then, of course.\" </p> <p>The serious business of the auction, and the items that Roberts finds genuinely exciting, will be generated from the dismantled huge industrial kitchen - the chrome fridges and marble-topped tables, the hobs and trolleys - all of which he imagines will be snapped up by restaurants at a fraction of their usual price.

      "bodyText": "Lot 100: the 8ft hamster Roberts approaches the fibreglass rodent and confidently dodging the \"is it a mouse/is it a hamster?\" debate, simply identifies it as a \"monument to bad taste\". The rodent once stood in the Work Zone. To the right of its paw is a block of yellow, fibreglass cheese. \"It's a mouse, with some cheese,\" says Roberts slowly, turning it over in his mind. Within seconds, he has identified a possible buyer. \"A theme pub will buy that and hang it out of their first-floor window because they've got a cheese board,\" he says. Roberts thinks they'll pay in the region of \u00a3350, although is at pains to point out that with two tasteless bidders in the room, you never know how high these things will go. Lot 103: the central nervous system Roberts's eye is caught by a sliver of brain, pancreas and two dismembered feet suspended, Damien Hirst-style, within a block of Perspex. Beside them hangs a human nervous system. \"They're plastic, I think,\" says Roberts, suddenly doubtful of how far into tastelessness the organisers have strayed. He picks up a model of a human eye, the size of a hub cap. \"This would make a wonderful mirror in someone's big loft apartment.\" Two prospective buyers can later be overheard discussing the merits of \"body-part art\", while a nearby dome steward sniggers into her neon vest. Lot 650: the oversized clock and other miscellany Getting into his stride now, Roberts considers a table of assorted tat - boardgames, shuttlecocks, a rubber chicken - and reflects on life's ironies. \"It's common,\" he says, waving an arm to take in the spread, \"but without the common touch. That's where the dome went wrong.\" A giant clockface stands before him, imprinted with the legend: \"the average person works 100,000 hours during their lifetime.\" It used to stand in the Work Zone. After observing what a shame it is that more hours weren't put into finding an imaginative way to deliver the statistic, Roberts says that the clock will find a home in the atrium of a big accountancy firm and could go for anything up to \u00a3300. Lot 91: the mannequin \"God,\" says Roberts, \"he'll never make it in window dressing.\" We are standing before a life-size doll, a man in a boilersuit grimacing as if he knows where he is. Roberts is quite taken and moves in closer. \"The Beamish Museum might be interested in him. They could use him as an engineer on the Flying Scotsman.\" He puts its value between \u00a3160 and \u00a3220. A dummy of a disconsolate England supporter is less well received. \"He looks more of a heroin addict than a football fan,\" sniffs Roberts. \"In fact, he doesn't look like a fan of anything.\" He declines to put a price on him. Lot 84: the sculpture Warming to his disgruntlement, Roberts rounds on a collection of Tony Hart/Womble style sculptures made from things other folk have thrown away. There is a bicycle built from bits of old sports equipment and a harp cobbled together from instruments. It is the model of a three-piece suit fashioned from old magazines, however, that provokes Roberts's outrage. \"It could go for \u00a320, it could go for \u00a3200,\" he says, shrugging helplessly at the vast irresponsibility of people with too much disposable income. \"It's Hannibal Lecter stuff,\" he rails. \"I mean, was the person who made this in an asylum? Your aunty might call it surrealism, but we both know what I would call it.\" I usher him into the nearest side room, realising too late that it's bare but for a row of hamster wheels, each occupied by a stuffed rodent. Lot 236: the rodents Unexpectedly, Roberts goes for the rodents. \"Nicholas Serota stuff, this,\" he says happily. \"I mean, you'll get pet owners bidding for the cages - I'd say \u00a3200 for a row of 20 - but the best place for this lot is Tate Modern.\" It is unclear whether Roberts is praising the rat installation or condemning modern art. Lot 957: the costumes Second-hand fleeces, nurses uniforms, air steward outfits - it is like the BBC wardrobe department in here, but Roberts thinks the Work Zone's costumes have wider potential. \"A club will open up in nine years time called the Millennium Experience and all this stuff will be at the cutting edge of fashion.\" He pulls at the corner of a sludge-green dress. \"You'll have to keep it in the cupboard until then, of course.\" The serious business of the auction, and the items that Roberts finds genuinely exciting, will be generated from the dismantled huge industrial kitchen - the chrome fridges and marble-topped tables, the hobs and trolleys - all of which he imagines will be snapped up by restaurants at a fraction of their usual price. A chrome fridge, usually \u00a32,500, might go for nearer \u00a3800. \"The best thing here is the catering equipment,\" says Roberts, \"and the stainless-steel ware.\" Lot 2989 is the first thing Roberts would himself consider bidding for.

What chance do a pair of bespectacled Lancastrian knob-twiddlers have in the world of b-boys and bling-bling? </p> <p>In fact, for the past five years Rae and Christian have been doing quite nicely, thank you. After founding Manchester's celebrated record store Fat City and the equally regarded label Grand Central, Mark Rae and Steve Christian have performed a remarkable balancing act. Their production style - soft keyboards and muted orchestral samples, influenced by US soul but shot through with a distinctly English strain of melancholy - has proved original and inventive enough to win that elusive Stateside respect: their records are packed with guest appearances by rap stars such as Jeru tha Damager and the Jungle Brothers. It's also proved palatable enough to allow the duo a lucrative parallel career as remixers of choice to Magic FM stalwarts such as Texas, Simply Red and Natalie Imbruglia. The one fly in the ointment was the failure of their excellent 1999 debut album, Northern Sulphuric Soul, to translate critical acclaim into crossover success. </p> <p>Two years on, Sleepwalking pools together a similar collection of taut, funky instrumentals, heavyweight guest rappers (this time, Californians the Pharcyde collaborate on two sparkling tracks) and moody ballads. They've even got an actual soul legend on board: 56-year-old Bobby Womack, who contributes to two tracks. Unfortunately, on Get a Life, Rae and Christian appear to have been so overawed by Womack's considerable presence they forgot to write a song, but the stirring voice that powered Across 110th Street saves the day. Wake Up Everybody, which boasts semi-improvised vocals and a darkly portentous backdrop, is a highlight. </p> <p>Better still is Vai Viver a Vida, the collaboration with Brazilian singer Tania Maria. A guest appearance by a Latin-American vocalist is usually an excuse for dance producers to make records riddled with cliches: they get the maracas out, hire a samba band, dress up like Carmen Miranda and start singing \"They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil\" in Speedy Gonzales accents. Thankfully, cultural tourism isn't on Rae and Christian's itinerary. Instead, Tania Maria's voice floats sexily around swelling strings and simple acoustic guitar. </p> <p>Only one collaboration falls entirely flat. There's no excuse for marooning the impassioned falsetto voices of roots reggae legends the Congos on the sort of anodyne funk that provides suburban clothes shops with background muzak. On Hold Us Down, lead Congo Cedric Mynton sounds like he's trying to chant down Babylon in a branch of Miss Selfridge. </p> <p>While they may wisely eschew working with British MCs, Rae and Christian have a knack for discovering home-grown singers. On Northern Sulphuric Soul they introduced the Mancunian Veba; here it's Rae's cousin, Kate Rogers, who provides Sleepwalking's stand-out track, Not Just Anybody. Her gorgeously drowsy voice is perfectly matched to shimmering, twilight atmospherics. </p> <p>Will Sleepwalking make mainstream stars of Rae and Christian? It seems unlikely: the album is defiantly out of step with current R&amp;B and hip-hop trends. There's no attempt to ape the vogueish, stuttering beats you hear on Destiny's Child or Aliyah hits. When the Pharcyde rap here, it's over propulsive breakbeats and muted jazz keyboards rather than the hook-laden, sample-heavy chart sound. But if it avoids current trends, it also avoids British hip-hop's fatal flaw: sounding like a clod-hopping pastiche. Sleepwalking boasts a style, and a charm, entirely its own.</p>",

Two years on, Sleepwalking pools together a similar collection of taut, funky instrumentals, heavyweight guest rappers (this time, Californians the Pharcyde collaborate on two sparkling tracks) and moody ballads. They've even got an actual soul legend on board: 56-year-old Bobby Womack, who contributes to two tracks. Unfortunately, on Get a Life, Rae and Christian appear to have been so overawed by Womack's considerable presence they forgot to write a song, but the stirring voice that powered Across 110th Street saves the day. Wake Up Everybody, which boasts semi-improvised vocals and a darkly portentous backdrop, is a highlight. Better still is Vai Viver a Vida, the collaboration with Brazilian singer Tania Maria. A guest appearance by a Latin-American vocalist is usually an excuse for dance producers to make records riddled with cliches: they get the maracas out, hire a samba band, dress up like Carmen Miranda and start singing \"They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil\" in Speedy Gonzales accents. Thankfully, cultural tourism isn't on Rae and Christian's itinerary. Instead, Tania Maria's voice floats sexily around swelling strings and simple acoustic guitar. Only one collaboration falls entirely flat. There's no excuse for marooning the impassioned falsetto voices of roots reggae legends the Congos on the sort of anodyne funk that provides suburban clothes shops with background muzak. On Hold Us Down, lead Congo Cedric Mynton sounds like he's trying to chant down Babylon in a branch of Miss Selfridge. While they may wisely eschew working with British MCs, Rae and Christian have a knack for discovering home-grown singers. On Northern Sulphuric Soul they introduced the Mancunian Veba; here it's Rae's cousin, Kate Rogers, who provides Sleepwalking's stand-out track, Not Just Anybody. Her gorgeously drowsy voice is perfectly matched to shimmering, twilight atmospherics. Will Sleepwalking make mainstream stars of Rae and Christian? It seems unlikely: the album is defiantly out of step with current R&amp;B and hip-hop trends. There's no attempt to ape the vogueish, stuttering beats you hear on Destiny's Child or Aliyah hits. When the Pharcyde rap here, it's over propulsive breakbeats and muted jazz keyboards rather than the hook-laden, sample-heavy chart sound. But if it avoids current trends, it also avoids British hip-hop's fatal flaw: sounding like a clod-hopping pastiche. Sleepwalking boasts a style, and a charm, entirely its own.",

The Red Thread is the latest addition to that rich tapestry Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton have been stitching since their debut in 1995: on the surface no different from the three albums preceeding it, yet as dissimilar from them as a new girlfriend is from an ex. Moffat's lyrics have a blush-inducing frankness (\"At least we know we're fuckable/ At least we're sated and we're tired\", \"My mind wonders what my hands would do/ To make sure that you came\"), and his mumbly voice sometimes drifts into the sleazy drawl you'd expect from a crooner in a late-night bar in the red-light district. But there is sweetness too, lines as simply sorrowful as \"We could pretend that this never started/ That you're still shy and I'm still broken-hearted\", that capture at once all the joy and awfulness of relationships. And the humanity of his writing is beautifully reflected in Middleton's majestic arrangements, from the curiously sprightly Love Detective to the icy slashes of guitar that rise up at the end of Demon Tips and the swooningly romantic strings on Haunt Me (reminiscent of the orchestration on label-owners the Delgados' Great Eastern album). Upliftingly depressing, these are songs to remind you why you fall in love. (MC) </p> <p><strong> Mahotella Queens</strong> Sebai Bai <br>(Indigo) <br>**** <br>\u00a315.99<br></p> <p> A rousing, utterly joyous set from three elderly South African women who were stars in the 1960s and 1970s and are now enjoying yet another revival. Hilda Tloubatla, Mildred Mangxola and Nobesuthu Mbada were among the finest female exponents of Mbaqanga, the home-grown mixture of R&amp;B, gospel and traditional styles that for years dominated the South African townships. There was a fashion for a male, deep-voiced ultra-bass singer - \"a groaner\" - to be joined by a female backing chorus, and the Mahotella Queens provided the backing for that greatest of groaners, Simon \"Mahlathini\" Nkabinde. His death two years ago should have marked the end of an era, but the Queens are back, and sound fresher and more confident than ever. They have even expanded their repertoire, now switching from gutsy, rolling and tuneful R&amp;B and pop songs through to delicate, unaccompanied close-harmony work. There are sections where they match Ladysmith Black Mambazo for their gently thrilling, delicate treatment of gospel and traditional songs, but then they switch to tight, rhythmic songs such as the catchy and slinky Umona, or to chugging, guitar-and-accordion-backed dance tunes that sound like the township answer to a country hoe-down. Great stuff. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Life Without Buildings</strong> Any Other City <br>(Tugboat Records) <br> *** <br> \u00a312.99<br></p> <p> Remember 1979? Life Without Buildings do, and with such affection that they've resurrected the sound of the Slits as a kind of artistic statement, adding nice tunes behind seemingly freeform yet stylised vocals. But although the guitars - slow and sweet or fast as a speeding heartbeat - work hard behind the lyrical hop-scotching, the songs' success depends on the vocal delivery of Sue Tompkins, spitting words like bullets or trilling like a Tellytubby on acid. Words are posed as questions and repetition is key, a sentence spoken over and over until it leads to an unrelated idea. Syllables are pronounced and usually followed by a yelp. \"Dar-ling, how come you so pret-ty?\" Tompkins asks in Philip, all Estuary vowels and attitude, her randomness either punk poetry or the inner workings of an anxious mind. Sorrow, with its spoken-word sadness, is great, and when Tompkins announces \"it's like the new past\", she's right. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Clem Snide </strong> Your Favorite Music <br>(Cooking Vinyl) <br> *** <br> \u00a313.99<br></p> <p> There is something rather too knowing about Boston quartet Clem Snide: from the way they stand ankle-deep in water and the faux-geekiness of their sky-blue dress-suits alleviated by MTV-friendly haircuts, to the song 1989, which limply parodies Prince's 1999. As with the Bobs, Barenaked Ladies and Big Daddy before them, it is as if Clem Snide cannot bear to be seen to take their chosen genre seriously. They excel at gentle but non-hickey country-tinged fare, made their own by singer and sole-songwriter Eef Barzelay's way with a wan lyric (when he elects not to take a stroll down Smug Avenue) and art-school graduate Jason Glasser's cello and violin. Best comes first with the lovely, cello-led My Dairy Queen, which swoons along at funereal pace and displays a richness of sound they never quite repeat. The brisk single, I Love the Unknown, is not too far behind, and a thoughtful cover of Ritchie Valens's Donna suggests their intentions are far from dishonourable, but they will have to lose the air of contrivance and twee nonsense such as Exercise if they are to progress. (JA) </p> <p><strong> 15.60.75 </strong> Jimmy Bell's Still in Town <br>(Glitterhouse) <br> **** <br>\u00a313.99<br></p> <p> This is a live album from a Cleveland septet, recorded in 1975 on the evening they somehow came to support Bob Marley on their home turf, featuring nobody who went onto greater things. Released shortly afterwards by the appositely elusive Water Brothers records, it should have passed into obscurity almost instantly. In fact, it did pass into obscurity until Pere Ubu's David Thomas pronounced it \"the only good album ever recorded by anyone\". Obviously Thomas is wrong, in the way that everyone is always wrong about their favourite album, but he has done the world a mini-favour by bullying his current label to re-release it. As with John Coltrane circling around and then tearing through My Favourite Things or the entire output of Laughing Clowns, 15.60.75 (AKA Numbers Band) possessed an overwhelming sense of watertight, driving urgency. Songwriter Robert Kidney's crisp vocals bring a Kevin Rowland-esque dramatic tension to Narrow Road and Animal Speaks, and when the three saxophones tootle in unison on Jimmy Bell and Thief, it's clear that Bob Marley had quite an act to follow that evening. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Leonard Cohen </strong> Field Commander Cohen - Tour of 1979 <br>(CBS) <br> *** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> A live Leonard Cohen album recorded on a British tour in December 1979? Released in February 2001? Since Cohen's last album of new songs, The Future, came out nearly 10 years ago, presumably this is a last-gasp effort to remind listeners that yes, there really was a bloke called Leonard Cohen who used to make rather good albums. Here, he sounds relaxed and philosophical, backed by a sympathetic band who pluck and massage a variety of Eastern-sounding stringed instruments. Though he sings Bird on a Wire and So Long, Marianne, much of the material is from the lesser-known reaches of Len's catalogue, so if you crave elderly live recordings of the obscure Cohen, this one's for you. Bizarre. Nice to hear the old boy again, nonetheless. (AS) </p> <p><strong> Ty </strong> Awkward <br>(Big Dada) <br>***<br> \u00a312.99 <br> </p> <p> From the same label as Roots Manuva comes this debut album of British hip-hop from the London-born, Nigerian Ben Chijioke, alias Ty. Compared to his \"conscious rap\" counterparts in the US, Ty's music is less dark and intense, his delivery pacific not hectoring. He raises issues such as bullying and sexual politics in a moderate way, just as the musical backdrop is a pleasant collage of soul, guitar and piano samples. While the sound is smooth enough to be American, the lyrics are very British: bizarre references to strongman Geoff Capes and Grifter bicycles make Awkward a CD adjunct to the sort of nostalgia peddled by Saturday night TV shows on BBC2. The production is crisp and DJ Pogo's turntable skills dextrous, creating a layered PM Dawn-ish effect on Trippin' Over Words and lending a haunting quality to The Nonsense. By She's Not Feeling Me at the Moment - a series of answerphone messages from an offended ex-girlfriend replayed by sensitive new man Ty - Awkward's relentless Anglocentricity has become quite appealing. In his spare time, Ty lectures schoolkids on the merits of enlightened behaviour and the evils of MTV - so well-meaning; the anti-Eminem. Awkward is the acceptable face of hip-hop, but really, the best hip-hop is always unacceptable. (PL) </p> <p><strong> Olu Dara </strong> Neighbourhoods<br> (Warner ESP) <br> ****<br>\u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> It's a surprise that more of us haven't heard of Mississippi's Olu Dara, a cornettist/ guitarist/singer who has won US awards for his work in contemporary dance and theatre, and has worked with the likes of Art Blakey, Cassandra Wilson and Brian Eno. But then, it's also a surprise that this atmospheric and spontaneously alive fusion of Afrobeat, gospel, jazz and blues is only the 60-year-old's second album. Dara's Afro-blues - reminiscent in parts of Fela Kuti, Jimi Hendrix, Beefheart and Dr John, who guests on Hammond B3 on four tracks here - is not a nostalgist's appropriation of roots forms; it's shot through with an unsentimental 21st-century urban grit. The balance of feelgood charm and sharp wit is played out in the contrast between the lullaby-like Out on the Rolling Sea (a traditional sailors' song from the Bahamas) and Red Ant (Nature), a wry allegory involving racial metaphor (\"I saw the red ant cryin'/ 'Cause the black ant was walking on his hill/ I saw the black ant cryin'/ 'Cause the white ant was trying to steal\") and ecological satire. What all the tracks share is Dara's light (and oddly youthful) touch, which makes Neighbourhood's vibrant meditation on the African diaspora a friendly creature with a sting in its tail.

      "byline": "John Fordham",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Henri Texier</strong> Remparts D'Argile <br> (Label Bleu) <br> **** <br>\u00a314.99 <br></p> <p> This is a remarkable improvised soundtrack to film-maker Jean-Louis Bertucelli's originally scoreless 1968 movie of the same name, with Henri Texier on bass, Sebastien Texier on saxes and clarinet, and Tony Rabeson on drums. Rabeson's playing is a very powerful element in this dramatic and darkly intense music; in the early sections his bumpy tom-tom pulse underpins long stretches of fast and feverish free-bop alto playing. As the sax stretches further and further out into multiphonic yelps and wails, Rabeson ups the ante with a hissing cymbal beat reminiscent of Sunny Murray and snare offbeats like the effect of a journey on a rutted road. Henri Texier displays an astonishing virtuosity on the bass: his mix of flying uptempo runs, furious strumming, sliding chords and deep, throbbing resonances sounds like Charles Mingus, Charlie Haden and Jimmy Garrison rolled into one. But he is just one apex of a superbly balanced triangle of collective improvisation. Fascinatingly, the prevailing musical atmosphere often strongly recalls the free jazz of the period in which the movie was made, particularly John Surman's white-hot but shortlived trio. Cheriba Courage has a folksy lilt: didgeridoo sounds mix with tambourine-like clatters while military pipe-melodies step sideways into dark melodic alleys. Vent Poussi\u00e8re (Dust Wind) is exquisitely suggested by Sebastien Texier's quiet clarinet over Rabeson's rustling, barely touched cymbal patterns. This is a real beauty, and you don't have to be a free-jazzer to hear that. </p> <p><strong> Louis Sclavis</strong> L'affrontement des Pr\u00e9tendants <br> (ECM) <br> *** <br> \u00a314.99 <br></p> <p> Another one from the premier league of the sharp-end French jazz scene. Henri Texier and multi-reed player Louis Sclavis have often been partners in bold and imaginative projects, but this set is for Sclavis's current quintet, adding trumpet, cello, bass and drums to the leader's hurtling virtuosity, particularly on clarinet. The leader has been preoccupied with a search for a southern European and north African-influenced new jazz over the past 15 years, and this set is full of scalding improvisations and wild sonic tumblings hitched to ecstatic, dancing melodies. Some of it is very jazzy, notably the episodes featuring the agile and inventive trumpeter Jean-Luc Cappozzo; some of it is tranquil and ruminative, with the ensemble sounds taking on chamber-music textures in their sustained cello lines and airy clarinet. Sclavis and Cappozzo duck and swerve in intimate unison on the eccentrically boppish theme of Hors les Murs, before Sclavis takes it on in winding, tinkling isolation, like water finding its way downhill over pebbles. Bassist Bruno Chevillon flickers at the top of the range in his unaccompanied solo and swings hard in his deft, running-on-tiptoe forays over the whole instrument. Sclavis's slow clarinet playing, classical in its sober poise, is very atmospheric, and if the set isn't as seamlessly powerful as his 1992 Duke Ellington album, or the remarkable 1996 study of Rameau's music, it's certainly up to the leader's determinedly original standards. </p> <p><strong> Perfect Houseplants</strong> New Folk Songs <br>(Linn) <br> *** <br> \u00a314.99 <br></p> <p> Perfect Houseplants is ex-Loose Tubes saxophonist Mark Lockheart's sparky quartet including the excellent pianist Huw Warren. Both Lockheart and Warren have followed folk muses as much as jazz ones (the pair have worked extensively with singer June Tabor), so the focus of this set is familiar territory for them and their regular listeners. But you still hear plenty of rugged jazz-blowing and a good deal of the nervily sardonic, fidgety melodic concepts that recall old Frank Zappa discs. The latter quality is prominent in the opening Lockheart composition Pageant, with its circling piano figure, blurted sax lines and clattery drumming; on Warren's gentle Holding Back, however, the groove is more Latin-tinged and sunnily Pat Metheny-like. The Barford Angel (another component of Lockheart's East Anglian suite) is a reminder of the close idiomatic links between this band and the aural landscape of Django Bates; here the instruments swim lazily around each other. The relaxed theme of Bubbles highlights Dudley Phillips's graceful, Steve Swallow-like bass guitar. A pretty agreeable mix on the whole, and with some inventive improvising, though the compositions in this corner of British folk-influenced jazz can sometimes merge into each other a little.</p>",

Rabeson's playing is a very powerful element in this dramatic and darkly intense music; in the early sections his bumpy tom-tom pulse underpins long stretches of fast and feverish free-bop alto playing. As the sax stretches further and further out into multiphonic yelps and wails, Rabeson ups the ante with a hissing cymbal beat reminiscent of Sunny Murray and snare offbeats like the effect of a journey on a rutted road. Henri Texier displays an astonishing virtuosity on the bass: his mix of flying uptempo runs, furious strumming, sliding chords and deep, throbbing resonances sounds like Charles Mingus, Charlie Haden and Jimmy Garrison rolled into one. But he is just one apex of a superbly balanced triangle of collective improvisation. Fascinatingly, the prevailing musical atmosphere often strongly recalls the free jazz of the period in which the movie was made, particularly John Surman's white-hot but shortlived trio. Cheriba Courage has a folksy lilt: didgeridoo sounds mix with tambourine-like clatters while military pipe-melodies step sideways into dark melodic alleys. Vent Poussi\u00e8re (Dust Wind) is exquisitely suggested by Sebastien Texier's quiet clarinet over Rabeson's rustling, barely touched cymbal patterns. This is a real beauty, and you don't have to be a free-jazzer to hear that. Louis Sclavis L'affrontement des Pr\u00e9tendants (ECM) *** \u00a314.99 Another one from the premier league of the sharp-end French jazz scene. Henri Texier and multi-reed player Louis Sclavis have often been partners in bold and imaginative projects, but this set is for Sclavis's current quintet, adding trumpet, cello, bass and drums to the leader's hurtling virtuosity, particularly on clarinet. The leader has been preoccupied with a search for a southern European and north African-influenced new jazz over the past 15 years, and this set is full of scalding improvisations and wild sonic tumblings hitched to ecstatic, dancing melodies. Some of it is very jazzy, notably the episodes featuring the agile and inventive trumpeter Jean-Luc Cappozzo; some of it is tranquil and ruminative, with the ensemble sounds taking on chamber-music textures in their sustained cello lines and airy clarinet. Sclavis and Cappozzo duck and swerve in intimate unison on the eccentrically boppish theme of Hors les Murs, before Sclavis takes it on in winding, tinkling isolation, like water finding its way downhill over pebbles. Bassist Bruno Chevillon flickers at the top of the range in his unaccompanied solo and swings hard in his deft, running-on-tiptoe forays over the whole instrument. Sclavis's slow clarinet playing, classical in its sober poise, is very atmospheric, and if the set isn't as seamlessly powerful as his 1992 Duke Ellington album, or the remarkable 1996 study of Rameau's music, it's certainly up to the leader's determinedly original standards. Perfect Houseplants New Folk Songs (Linn) *** \u00a314.99 Perfect Houseplants is ex-Loose Tubes saxophonist Mark Lockheart's sparky quartet including the excellent pianist Huw Warren. Both Lockheart and Warren have followed folk muses as much as jazz ones (the pair have worked extensively with singer June Tabor), so the focus of this set is familiar territory for them and their regular listeners. But you still hear plenty of rugged jazz-blowing and a good deal of the nervily sardonic, fidgety melodic concepts that recall old Frank Zappa discs. The latter quality is prominent in the opening Lockheart composition Pageant, with its circling piano figure, blurted sax lines and clattery drumming; on Warren's gentle Holding Back, however, the groove is more Latin-tinged and sunnily Pat Metheny-like. The Barford Angel (another component of Lockheart's East Anglian suite) is a reminder of the close idiomatic links between this band and the aural landscape of Django Bates; here the instruments swim lazily around each other. The relaxed theme of Bubbles highlights Dudley Phillips's graceful, Steve Swallow-like bass guitar. A pretty agreeable mix on the whole, and with some inventive improvising, though the compositions in this corner of British folk-influenced jazz can sometimes merge into each other a little.",

The \u00a3700m rescue package was reported to be in jeopardy because four major banks had rejected Kirch's approaches. However, the company today denied reports it was pulling out of the deal and said it was close to securing the finance. Kirch has agreed to buy half EM.TV's 50% interest in formula-one holding company SLEC. Banks had originally balked at supporting the deal because SLEC owner Bernie Ecclestone is threatening to block it. Mr Ecclestone wields a veto over any change of control in SLEC and he is backed by FIA, the formula one governing body. If the deal goes through, control of formula one will pass into German hands, as Kirch has also agreed to finance a shareholding option that would give EM.TV a further 25% of SLEC.

Just out Uncle Roy's Mellow Moffat Mustard with honey and malt whisky Form: Beige mustard rather than the English yellow. Flavour: Very mild; quite fruity, almost appley (no surprise; see below); marked but mellow acidity; musky flavour of mustard comes through late in the day. Verdict: Made with water, mustard flour, apple puree, honey, vinegar, salt, malt whisky, salt and spices - not sure what happened to the whisky, but the rest is in evidence. And I can't stop tasting it... Delivery: Made by a small shop, Harvest-Time, and available by post (01683 221177). 10p from each jar goes to Help a Child. It's a taste-good, feel-good package. Cost: \u00a31.90/190g",

Mr Howarth claimed \"by the end of 1999, Hollywood agents loathed and detested men's magazines and would not put forward their stars for covers\". His remarks follow a 40% circulation drop for Esquire in the last ABCs. This has been blamed largely on the decision to move away from using semi-naked women on the cover. Mr Howarth told MediaGuardian.co.uk: \"If the perception among agents is men's magazines are just about showing women in a state of undress, they won't put forward their highest-profile female stars.\" And he argued men's magazines feature much lower-profile celebrities now than they did before the lad's mags took off in 1994. Many will regard Mr Howarth's comments as sour grapes - his magazine's circulation took the heaviest battering in the beleaguered men's sector. But he claimed he is pleased Esquire has shed its downmarket readers. Mr Howard said it was time for the rest of the industry to stop scrapping over the \"general purchasing slurry\" and stake out their magazines' own identities.

The aim is to tackle the ongoing crisis in maternity services.

According to the latest audit of services by the English National Board (ENB), more than 30% of maternity units were unable to provide women with one-to-one midwife care in labour in 1999. There is an important link between a lack of continuous midwifery support during childbirth and the rising incidence of medical intervention, including caesarean section during childbirth. When women have continuous support during labour and birth, there is a reduction in their need for pain relief, fewer operative vaginal and caesarean deliveries and, the baby is more likely to be born in a better condition. </p> <p>Currently women don't get all the midwifery support they need in childbirth and suffer unnecessary interventions. The latest figures from the ENB show that in 1999, 41% of NHS maternity services had a caesarean section rate of more than 20%, compared with 25% of units in 1998. Maternal mortality, even for non-emergency operations is nearly three times higher than for vaginal birth. A caesarean section, particularly a second one, increases risks of haemorrhage and emergency hysterectomy. </p> <p>So why do we have midwife shortages? Around two-thirds of midwives are mothers themselves, and more than half of midwives in the UK now work part-time.

This old-fashioned view is one of the midwife as a dedicated professional, it regards those who work less than full-time as \"not committed to the job\", sees discussion of family responsibilities as \"unprofessional\", and efforts to accommodate flexible working as a sign of managerial weakness. The government has stated these opinions are no longer tenable in the NHS, but how long will it take to change on the ground? </p> <p>Midwives around the world have traditionally seen themselves as \"guardians of the normal\" and we know that where midwifery is autonomous evidence shows that outcomes for low-risk women and their babies are excellent. If the trend of mergers of maternity units continues, one solution promises to contribute to solving both the rising intervention rates and the midwifery staffing crisis.</p> <p>Midwife-led birth centres provide care for low-risk women, are locally accessible, provide continuity of care, humanised care and have had good outcomes for women and babies. Community-based midwifery group practices link into birth centres and GPs, and offer a range of services to women, from offering birth at home or in a birth centre to providing integrated care to women with complex problems. Birth centres are supported by tertiary referral centres that are fully equipped with specialist midwifery, obstetric and neonatal services to care for women with complex problems in pregnancy and birth.</p> <p>In addition, most birth centres have waiting lists of midwives who want to work in them.

      "bodyText": "The multi-million pound squabble over a printing plant shared by the Express and the Telegraph escalated today with the tabloid's new owner Richard Desmond refusing to pay a \u00a34m bill. Mr Desmond, who is co-owner of the Westferry Plant, has told Telegraph owner Hollinger he will not settle the printing charges until he gets \u00a311m from his partners. He claims the money is the dividend owed to his Northern &amp; Shell company for his 50% stake in the plant. But insiders at Hollinger are privately seething at the behaviour of Northern &amp; Shell executives, with one claiming \"those guys must be smoking something\". Today's development marks a new low-point in relations between both parties, who fell out earlier this year when Hollinger agreed to buy the stake. Hollinger has balked at the \u00a380m price demanded by the OK! publisher's advisers, and the opposing camps are poles apart in terms of valuation. \"The Westferry company owes the Express an \u00a311m dividend, so the Express has stopped making printing payments. \"Hollinger's refusal to pay out is part and parcel of the brinkmanship behind this process,\" said a source close to Northern &amp; Shell. The source added the proposed fee for the Westferry stake had been calculated through a complex formula designed by Hollinger owner Conrad Black, and had been approved by three independent parties. The dispute was sparked when Mr Desmond inherited the stake in the plant through the \u00a3125m acquisition of the Express group from Lord Hollick's United Business Media group in November last year. Dan Colson, vice-chairman of Hollinger, today scorned Northern &amp; Shell's demands for a dividend. He said the money could only be paid out if Mr Desmond supplied a budget for his contribution to the plant. \"We have no objection in principle to the idea of a dividend because half of it comes to us,\" he said. \"But we have a problem with paying a dividend where proper budgets have not been agreed between the shareholders. \"The dividend needs to take into account the ongoing capital expenditure and working capital requirements of the business,\" he added. The dispute over the Westferry stake is heading for the courtroom as both sides have yet to agree on an arbitrator. If no arbitrator can be found over the next nine days, the matter will go to court, where a judge will appoint an independent negotiator to settle the price for the stake. \"Northern &amp; Shell is a thorn in the side to Hollinger, because it does things in a different way. \"They will kick you in the nuts if they feel they are being kicked in the nuts,\" said one source close to the dispute. Westferry is a lucrative property that prints the southern editions of the Financial Times, the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph, and the Express newspapers. Mr Desmond has decided to sell his 50% holding after taking out a \u00a397m loan to fund the Express acquisition. Feb 6: Stalemate over Westferry price",

      "bodyText": "Russian MPs are apparently to forgo one of the more pleasurable perks of their position, all in the interests of the souring relationship between Washington and Moscow. Dmitri Rogozin, the influential head of the Duma's foreign affairs committee, has just announced that his parliamentary colleagues are to put a stop to \"political tourism\" funded by the Americans. The Duma will henceforth pay for its members' trips to the US. White House or Congressional sponsorship offers will be refused. Russian feelings are hurt by US magnanimity, it seems, though it is not clear why. But in the Moscow-Washington double act these days, the Russians are very quick to take offence, while the Americans appear to be issuing insults gratuitously and with gusto. The other week in Munich when Donald Rumsfeld, the Pentagon chief, made his European debut at a security conference, he deliberately forgot to mention Russia even once in his speech. To rub salt into the wound, he then went back to America without finding the time to see Sergei Ivanov, President Vladimir Putin's top aide, who then made a speech to the conference which bristled with resentment of the west. \"It was Rumsfeld's way of sending a signal, part of the psychological attack,\" said Sergei Rogov, director of the Moscow think tank, the US-Canada Institute. \"He sees Russia as a less important issue, so he met the Nato ministers and ignored Ivanov.\" Such calculated snubs rankle the Russians. The erstwhile superpower is used to a seat at the top table, demands to be accepted as an equal in international relations, just can't accept the reduced status that goes with having a gross domestic product smaller than Belgium's. Madeleine Albright last year called America the world's indispensable power. This week one of her colleagues in the Clinton administration called Russia \"a jealous and crumpled superpower\". On an entire raft of issues from Nato expansion to national missile shields, from Iran and Iraq to the Balkans or the oil fields of central Asia, from media freedoms to freedom of religion, the US and Russia are at odds. The early noises from the new Republican administration are worrying and angering the Russians. In recent weeks, the US defence secretary, national security adviser and CIA chief have all described Mr Putin's Russia as a \"problem\" and a \"threat to the west\". While the US this week arrested an alleged Russian mole inside the FBI, on Monday the Russians are to try a young academic accused of spying for American military intelligence. Amid all these neo-cold war jitters, the most telling shift in perception and the point that upsets the Russians most may be that the Bush administration is downgrading Russia as a foreign policy priority and relegating it to second rate status. The Russian military analyst, Alexander Golts, noted recently that Russia's top generals and politicians thrive on confrontation and argument and enjoy being seen as peers and rivals. It is more humiliating by far for them to be treated as has-beens, ignored as representatives of a once great power now in steep decline. The Russian army top brass appear to be relishing the row with the Americans over ''Son of Star Wars'', the US national missile defence project, because it takes them back to their cold war heyday when they called the shots and were taken seriously. It's hardly surprising, says a west European ambassador in Moscow, that the Russians are having such troubles adjusting to the straitened circumstances of imperial retreat and loss of great power status. The jury is still out, he says, on whether the elites of Britain or France have fully adapted to their more limited post-imperial identities decades after they lost their colonies. Russia's struggle to come to terms with the loss of empire will, if anything, be longer and harder. On the missile shield row, this helps explain Russia's determination to cling to the terms of the 1972 anti-ballistic missiles treaty, the bedrock of modern arms control, as well as the new US administration's apparent resolve to ditch it. The ABM treaty gave and still gives the Russians a certain parity with the US, allowing the Russians these days to punch above their weight.

      "bodyText": "The Archers, \"an everyday story of countryfolk\", is the longest running radio serial in the world. Its origins go back to a farmer's brainwave at a meeting of broadcasters, farmers and Ministry of Agriculture officials on January 3 1948. This was the day of an uncommon planetary configuration - Uranus opposite to horsey Jupiter in fiery Sagittarius, the sign of the Archer. Why Uranus? This is the hi-tech planet of innovation and, as part of its public service brief, the BBC was expected to coax farmers to submit to modern methods in the dark days of post-war rationing. So in the opening episodes, Dan Archer retires his two shire horses, Blossom and Boxer, to make way for the tractor. The horoscope for the first broadcast (11am, January 1 1951) lacks fiery passion and high drama and is stacked with practical, earthy Capricorn, with innovative Uranus prominent again. Capricorn is a conventional, conservative sign - famous for longevity and improving with age - and astrologers reckon the Goat gets younger and hornier as it gets older. In addition to strong earth, the Archers also has a principled Mars in Aquarius and a Libra Moon. These air signs love people, putting an emphasis on social values and being part of a community. Vanessa Whitburn has been producer since 1991 and she is a lively Sagittarian Archer herself. She connects with the programme's Libran Moon through her serious Saturn and tough-minded Mars, giving it a hard edge of authenticity when it comes to the realistic worries of country people. Libra often has a problem with balance, however, and Whitburn admits she has sometimes failed to get this right in the past. Her feminism has led to a long-running spat with a former producer, William Smethurst, headlined in the Telegraph (9/9/96) as an \"everyday story of Leftist tripe\". Similar questions of political correctness have now resurfaced with Lucas Madakane, a new character from South Africa, and the big, unanswered question, \"Is he black?\". The listener is never quite sure because nothing is stated explicitly, but how real would this non-comment be in a real-life Ambridge? Mark Lawson (16/2/01 Guardian) believes \"Ambridge's racism, like its defecation, may be occurring out of earshot\" and that the programme gets its messages across with subtle, rather than blatant references - \"The Archers is playing a complicated and fascinating game with our attitudes to race\". On the other hand, Daily Telegraph readers may switch off in droves. As always, getting the right balance is never easy for a Libran Moon. Vanessa Whitburn's horoscope shows controversy this autumn and she may decide to come out fighting and push social realism even further. The programme could also be in the media spotlight and have a celebrity profile in the latter half of 2002. So are we heading for another 50 years of life in Ambridge? The Archers has such a dignified horoscope, there is no obvious sign of it running out of steam - ever. Da di-dum di-dum di-dum... Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

It is the second major sponsorship deal within a week for LG Electronics, formerly known as Lucky Goldstar. Last week it shelled out \u00a32.5m to have its name emblazoned across the shirts of Leicester City Football Club, replacing the Walkers Crisps logo. LG Electronics also sponsors football's reigning world champions France, the Australian national team, top Romanian club side Dynamo Bucharest and yachting's BT Global Challenge. BBC Sport will cover the LG Cup at Preston's Guild Hall exclusively from September 1 to 9. The Korean-based company's sponsorship will run for three years. World Snooker believes the involvement of LG Electronics will enable the sport to attract interest from more blue-chip companies. \"We promised members a new sponsor and we have delivered,\" said Mark Wildman, chairman of World Snooker. \"The fact such a prestigious company has decided to get involved at the top of the game is a real boost for the sport and I am sure that both parties will reap the benefits,\" he added.

With such a collapse could go his IMF-backed efforts since 1999 to reduce inflation, cut the budget deficit and pursue deregulation and privatisation programmes. </p> <p>Mr Ecevit has not so much been blocking these investigations as trying to find ways of living with them. All the same, the bigger questions of reform reach far beyond tawdry kickbacks and bribes. The choice for Turkey is stark and for Europe, too, the stakes are high. </p> <p>On one hand, there is the prospect, agreed at the 1999 Helsinki summit, of full Turkish membership of the EU within a decade. Linked to that aspiration are hopes that the long dispute over Cyprus, which Turkey invaded in 1974, can be settled; that Aegean territorial disputes with Greece can be defused; that Turkey's dismal human rights record will be improved; that legal recognition of the cultural and linguistic rights of Kurds and Armenians can be achieved; and that Turkey's secular tradition can find peaceful accommodation with a more assertive Islamism. </p> <p>On this uncertain prospect of reform rests the overall aim of Turkey becoming an integrated member of the EU, a solid western ally and a bridge to central Asia and the Middle East. Uniquely, for example, Turkey currently pursues unofficial commercial cooperation with Iraq and military cooperation with Israel, while hosting US planes enforcing the Kurdish no-fly zone at the same time. </p> <p>The likely scenario if reform fails, on the other hand, is dismaying. If Mr Sezer and Mr Ecevit cannot sort out their differences and the economic crisis turns overtly political, one or both may be forced to resign and the coalition government may fall.

For these reasons alone, should the economic crisis grow more severe, the Bush administration may be forced to overcome its dislike of financial bailouts and push the IMF into providing expanded assistance. </p> <p>But the biggest victims of any extended crisis would be the Turkish people, let down once again by the political, business and military elite's inability to reform, and frustrated in their ambition to join the ranks of modern European nation states.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown and Clare Short will announce plans on Monday for a multibillion-pound international fund to provide cheap vaccines against childhood diseases to developing countries. The chancellor and international development secretary will use a London conference on children to unveil proposals for the fund, aimed at reducing the 10m deaths each year of children under five. The plan is for the world's richest countries, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) to guarantee a market for drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, and subsidise research costs. It is intended to make up lost ground in meeting the aim of reducing world poverty by 2015, set at the UN social summit in Copenhagen in 1995. Mr Brown said in an interview with the Guardian: \"The loss of life is unacceptable ... there is a recognition now that unless we act together and are clear about who takes responsibility, the targets we have set will take longer to meet and in some cases may not be met at all. We are determined to move further and faster towards meeting the UN targets.\" Two weeks ago the Guardian highlighted the problem faced by developing countries which cannot pay the huge bill for drugs needed to fight Aids and other epidemics. Mr Brown believes it is time the G7 most industrialised countries used their influence as the dominant members of the IMF and World Bank to focus their attention on the 2015 targets: to cut infant mortality by two-thirds, put every child in primary school and reduce the number of people living below the breadline by half. Oxfam says child mortality is falling at less than half the rate required to meet the first target: if present trends continue there will be 8.5m child deaths in 2015. The education target is even more in danger unless the G7 takes the initiative next week, and this too will be raised at Monday's conference. The conference, attended by the heads of the World Bank and IMF and addressed by video link by Nelson Mandela and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, will be the first of a series of international meetings highlighting concern for children. Continuing at the spring meetings of the Bank and IMF and the summer meeting of the G7, the progamme will culminate in a special session of the UN. Mr Mandela and his wife Graca Machel are leading a Global Coalition for Children. Mr Brown said that 2001 would be a crucial year. \"This London meeting is the start of the process that I see dominating the international agenda this year.\" To demonstrate his commitment he plans to introduce a tax credit in the Budget to subsidise vaccines research and development. He is also expected to announce tax relief for overseas donations of existing drugs by pharmaceutical companies. The fund to develop new vaccines is likely to include both public and private money, although Mr Brown believes the biggest contribution the private sector can make is to devote more research to the big three killer diseases: malaria, TB and HIV/Aids. At the moment the big pharmaceutical companies devote just 10% of R&amp;D to diseases effecting 90% of the global population. Mr Brown said the government had held private talks with pharmaceutical companies and would put specific proposals to them. \"We are expecting a response from the pharmaceutical industry. It's possible to do more. We must be sure that the pharmaceutical companies are going to do more. \"There is now a view that this is an opportunity that must be taken up. As lives are lost, to delay in taking action is unacceptable.\"",

      "body": "<p>The existence of the NHS does relatively little for the nation's health: just as sewers not doctors cured cholera, so creating a better off, better educated population does more for heart attacks than building extra coronary care units. But the political health of successive governments has depended on perceptions of the NHS. Unless it is drip-fed above-inflation increases every year, there is hell to pay. Parsimony always results in winter crises, soaring waiting lists and patients on trolleys plastered all over the front pages. It was a lesson of post war political history Labour should not have ignored. </p> <p>For the first two years spending bumped along at the bottom. This followed a thin time under John Major, when annual increases in NHS spending averaged 2.6%, compared with a post-war average of 3.4%. Since the founding of the NHS was Labour's proudest boast, people expected to see real improvements and fast, however hard the party tried to damp down expectations. They did not happen. The pledge to cut waiting lists by 100,000 was modest - but even that proved perilously hard to achieve. To compensate, a flurry of hospitals were built at once on the never-never. Thanks to the private finance initiative, capital spending was taken off Treasury accounts. The government reckoned patients seeing gleaming new hospitals would not bother to question dubious 30-year debts to the private sector. </p> <p>Labour's NHS crisis broke in late 1999, personified in Mavis Skeet whose cancer operation was cancelled four times in five weeks because of bed shortages, until her condition became inoperable. Political reaction to her story triggered the biggest spending promise the NHS has ever had. After Lord Winston, the nation's most famous doctor, said the NHS was the worst in Europe and Labour policy \"deceitful\", Tony Blair dashed to the studios to calm nerves. </p> <p>He promised the UK would henceforth match the European Union average in health spending, expressed as a proportion of GDP. That meant a guaranteed 6.1% year on year increase, 35% more by March 2005. When the chancellor confirmed it in the budget, the British Medical Association tore up the usual grumbling press release it had prepared and spoke unequivocally of its delight. The good news only goes so far, however, as the graph shows. New calculations by the King's Fund show the gap between the UK and the rest of Europe remains and may even grow. </p> <p>Besides, for voters mammoth figures signify little. Most NHS cash goes on staff who are hard to find and long to train. Official waiting lists did come down thanks to much pushing - and longer waiting times for first appointments. Demand rose and so did total volume of treatment, as it has steadily since 1948. After a bad first two years, pay for doctors and nurses did rise, but not enough to stem shortages - 22,000 unfilled nursing vacancies at the end of 2000. </p> <p>With the money came a new NHS plan. It embraced the already launched National Institute for Clinical Excellence which seeks to identify the most effective drugs and treatments, spreading best practice everywhere. The new commission for health improvement acts as a medical Ofsted, examining hospital performance. Tony Blair envisioned a consumer-friendly health service so the first available new money went to the most visible places - accident and emergency departments and 25 high street walk-in clinics for people too busy to take half a day off to see a GP. The plan promised abolition of hospital waiting lists by 2005 and shorter waiting for GP appointments. To the prime minister the danger was that the middle classes would abandon the NHS if it failed to compete with the glossy brochures of the private clinics. </p> <p>The national plan of July 2000 offered a long menu: 7,000 more beds, 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs and 20,000 more nurses, with targets for everything from cleaner hospitals and prescribing powers for chemists and nurses. But since none of this has happened yet, it has made no impact with the public. It has, however, stuffed the mouths of the medical professions for the time being: there is a lull in the usual grumbling from the wards. </p> <p>Before the big promise to match EU funding, speculation was growing that the NHS could not survive on the current basis. The Tories and rightwing think-tanks claimed that only private insurance would raise standards. Even Labour ministers were floating the need for a hypothecated tax - an ear-marked extra tax for the NHS. The big spending promise stilled these voices. But we may now be witnessing the NHS's last chance, at least as a service paid for out of general taxation. If even this great increase fails to deliver standards that match public expectations, many more may turn to private practice, leaving the NHS as a poor service for poor people. But the NHS is recognised internationally for its efficiency in getting value for the low sums spent. If total health outlays in the UK were to come near to what the French and Germans spend, it ought to improve markedly. But that is for the future. For the Blair government 1997-2001, the outcome so far is poor. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers can order a copy of Did Things Get Better?: An Audit of Labour's Successes and Failures by Polly Toynbee &amp; David Walker for \u00a36.99 (including first class delivery).

      "bodyText": "The existence of the NHS does relatively little for the nation's health: just as sewers not doctors cured cholera, so creating a better off, better educated population does more for heart attacks than building extra coronary care units. But the political health of successive governments has depended on perceptions of the NHS. Unless it is drip-fed above-inflation increases every year, there is hell to pay. Parsimony always results in winter crises, soaring waiting lists and patients on trolleys plastered all over the front pages. It was a lesson of post war political history Labour should not have ignored. For the first two years spending bumped along at the bottom. This followed a thin time under John Major, when annual increases in NHS spending averaged 2.6%, compared with a post-war average of 3.4%. Since the founding of the NHS was Labour's proudest boast, people expected to see real improvements and fast, however hard the party tried to damp down expectations. They did not happen. The pledge to cut waiting lists by 100,000 was modest - but even that proved perilously hard to achieve. To compensate, a flurry of hospitals were built at once on the never-never. Thanks to the private finance initiative, capital spending was taken off Treasury accounts. The government reckoned patients seeing gleaming new hospitals would not bother to question dubious 30-year debts to the private sector. Labour's NHS crisis broke in late 1999, personified in Mavis Skeet whose cancer operation was cancelled four times in five weeks because of bed shortages, until her condition became inoperable. Political reaction to her story triggered the biggest spending promise the NHS has ever had. After Lord Winston, the nation's most famous doctor, said the NHS was the worst in Europe and Labour policy \"deceitful\", Tony Blair dashed to the studios to calm nerves. He promised the UK would henceforth match the European Union average in health spending, expressed as a proportion of GDP. That meant a guaranteed 6.1% year on year increase, 35% more by March 2005. When the chancellor confirmed it in the budget, the British Medical Association tore up the usual grumbling press release it had prepared and spoke unequivocally of its delight. The good news only goes so far, however, as the graph shows. New calculations by the King's Fund show the gap between the UK and the rest of Europe remains and may even grow. Besides, for voters mammoth figures signify little. Most NHS cash goes on staff who are hard to find and long to train. Official waiting lists did come down thanks to much pushing - and longer waiting times for first appointments. Demand rose and so did total volume of treatment, as it has steadily since 1948. After a bad first two years, pay for doctors and nurses did rise, but not enough to stem shortages - 22,000 unfilled nursing vacancies at the end of 2000. With the money came a new NHS plan. It embraced the already launched National Institute for Clinical Excellence which seeks to identify the most effective drugs and treatments, spreading best practice everywhere. The new commission for health improvement acts as a medical Ofsted, examining hospital performance. Tony Blair envisioned a consumer-friendly health service so the first available new money went to the most visible places - accident and emergency departments and 25 high street walk-in clinics for people too busy to take half a day off to see a GP. The plan promised abolition of hospital waiting lists by 2005 and shorter waiting for GP appointments. To the prime minister the danger was that the middle classes would abandon the NHS if it failed to compete with the glossy brochures of the private clinics. The national plan of July 2000 offered a long menu: 7,000 more beds, 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs and 20,000 more nurses, with targets for everything from cleaner hospitals and prescribing powers for chemists and nurses. But since none of this has happened yet, it has made no impact with the public. It has, however, stuffed the mouths of the medical professions for the time being: there is a lull in the usual grumbling from the wards. Before the big promise to match EU funding, speculation was growing that the NHS could not survive on the current basis. The Tories and rightwing think-tanks claimed that only private insurance would raise standards. Even Labour ministers were floating the need for a hypothecated tax - an ear-marked extra tax for the NHS. The big spending promise stilled these voices. But we may now be witnessing the NHS's last chance, at least as a service paid for out of general taxation. If even this great increase fails to deliver standards that match public expectations, many more may turn to private practice, leaving the NHS as a poor service for poor people. But the NHS is recognised internationally for its efficiency in getting value for the low sums spent. If total health outlays in the UK were to come near to what the French and Germans spend, it ought to improve markedly. But that is for the future. For the Blair government 1997-2001, the outcome so far is poor. \u0095 Readers can order a copy of Did Things Get Better?: An Audit of Labour's Successes and Failures by Polly Toynbee &amp; David Walker for \u00a36.99 (including first class delivery).

The agency is monitoring the hotline closely for evidence of increasing consumer concern. \"We have received a number of calls from members of the public unnecessarily worried about the safety of meat and dairy products. \"We need to explain why the disease does not pose a food safety threat,\" said the spokesman.

It is to be shown in France in a bid to cut the country's high rate of road accidents. It will be dubbed into French and will run on commercial channels from next week.

When she has to stop suddenly, her son, who is sitting in the back seat and not wearing a seat belt, is thrown forward, hitting her in the head and killing her. The advert aims to show it is not just your own life you could be putting at risk when you fail to belt up in the back - and fatalities can occur at speeds as low as 30 miles an hour.

However, pre-tax profits slipped 3% to \u00a3690m as the Anglo-Dutch group spent heavily on new ways to make its catalogue of medical, scientific and business publications such as the Lancet and New Scientist available to paying subscribers online. \"Reed Elsevier will eventually become a largely electronic, internet-based business,\" Mr Davis said. Shares in Reed yesterday rose 27 to 662p.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The arguments that have gone on for years over Iraq have become so entrenched and bitter that it is difficult to disengage from them and recognise how much has changed. Sanctions are still discussed as if they were effective, whereas they have now almost completely withered away. Military action by the Americans and the British is still weighed as if the initiative lay with Washington, which has not been so for years. Neither the flurry of condemnatory declarations around the world after last week's raids, nor the justifications of the generals who ordered them moves us much forward in understanding the nature of what is undoubtedly one of the gravest world problems, the continued existence of Saddam Hussein's regime.</p> <p>Some critics of the raids persist in presenting them as an attack pure and simple, whereas they are more properly seen as an attempt to prevent an escalation of the conflict. The American and British governments acted not only to safeguard their servicemen after Iraq upgraded its air defences but also to avert the political and military crisis that would have burst upon us had the Iraqis shot down aircraft and captured pilots.</p> <p>Think of the pressures both for retaliation and for appeasement in that case, the opportunism of third parties rushing in to mediate, the upsurge of emotion in the Arab world, the difficulty of taking rational decisions in such an atmosphere! This danger has been reduced by the raids, but at the same time they show how fragile is a policy which depends on the calculation that we will never lose planes or aircrew, certainly not in any number.</p> <p>Yet the no-fly zones are still the most intact and the most defensible element in the once formidable array of measures to contain Iraq. They provide some protection for the Kurds and for the Kuwaitis, in that as long as they exist Saddam could never be sure of American reaction if he tried to resume full control of the north or if he moved in a big way toward the Kuwaiti border. Those inclined to think of the no-fly zones as disposable should bear in mind the attitude of people like Mahmoud Osman, a Kurdish socialist leader, who told the Guardian this week that he knew of no Kurd who did not want them to continue to be enforced, and the views of the Kuwaitis, so often brushed aside by other Arabs. The no-fly zones also symbolise some degree of resolve.</p> <p>Like sanctions, even in their now vestigial form, they are a way of saying that the Iraqi regime is not a normal government, to be treated in a normal way, and that at no point in the years since the Gulf war ended has it made a single sincere effort to comply with United Nations resolutions.</p> <p>But is a point of principle worth imposing if it causes much human suffering? Here again, events have moved us on from the old arguments. Madeleine Albright became infamous in the Arab world when she replied to questions about the impact of sanctions on Iraqi civilians, especially children, by saying: \"We think the price is worth it.\"</p> <p>But that was before the effect of sanctions had been reduced both by changes in the rules which gave the Iraqi government more income and freedom to trade, and by massive evasions. The critics of sanctions cannot say both that they have become a joke and that they are still, whatever may have been the case in the past, the main cause of the misfortunes of Iraqis.</p> <p>The deterioration in the conditions of life in Iraq must have many causes, notably the devastation that Saddam brought on his country by waging war on Iran. The damage done in the Kuwait war was piled on top of that.</p> <p>A society which for a while had appeared to be flush with funds and which was engaged in pell-mell modernisation and urbanisation, highly dependent on imported items for its infra-structure, suddenly regressed. If it had been less developed, it would have been less damaged.</p> <p>Saddam's government was peculiarly incapable of managing the resulting crisis. Quite apart from the ruthless diversion of funds to military spending, the Iraqi government is neither efficient or fair. It had operated for years a wasteful system of social bribery, selectively rewarding army, party, bureaucracy, and business class.</p> <p>In the old days even the least privileged derived some benefit, and there was typically lavish spending on social services. Indeed the case can be made that Saddam went to war, both with Iran and Kuwait, precisely so he could maintain this profligate style. When this could no longer be done, the circle within which people were sustained and rewarded by the government was redrawn, and those outside duly suffered.</p> <p>Sanctions certainly did not help, but the argument that they were contributory rather than central is strengthened by the fact that there has been no clear improvement in life for ordinary people in Iraq since they were run down.</p> <p>The new American secretary of state, Colin Powell, travelling around the Middle East over the next few days, has the unenviable job of trying to persuade Arab leaders that there can be a common approach to Iraq. But the coalition created at the time of the Gulf war cannot be revived.</p> <p>It was already on its last legs in 1996, when Saddam sent his tanks into Irbil and suffered no consequences, and it expired by late 1998, when the last major American missile onslaught on Iraq went unsupported. Arab governments are motivated by a fear of Saddam and by a fear of their own public opinion, and these fears could only be allayed if they thought the United States was determined to remove Saddam.</p> <p>The Bush administration has not shown such a determination, and, while it may be harder on Iraq than its predecessor, it does not seem likely it will do so. In deed, the US and Britain would probably end sanctions in all but a few categories if Iraq would agree to a restoration of arms inspections, even if those inspections were likely to be superficial. Saddam's desire for the total humiliation of his enemies may nevertheless prevent this happening.</p> <p>Sanctions might have worked, in spite of Saddam's obstinacy, if they had not been quite quickly subverted. As Tim Trevan, a former adviser to the UN special commission for Iraq, wrote in his book \"impatience with sanctions is the best way to ensure they will not work\", while \"increasing support for sanctions over time, as with Rhodesia and South Africa\" can convince a regime that it must buckle under.</p> <p>Iraq, instead, saw sanctions unravelling rather than strengthening as Russia, China, France, and Arab states dropped out.

      "bodyText": "The arguments that have gone on for years over Iraq have become so entrenched and bitter that it is difficult to disengage from them and recognise how much has changed. Sanctions are still discussed as if they were effective, whereas they have now almost completely withered away. Military action by the Americans and the British is still weighed as if the initiative lay with Washington, which has not been so for years. Neither the flurry of condemnatory declarations around the world after last week's raids, nor the justifications of the generals who ordered them moves us much forward in understanding the nature of what is undoubtedly one of the gravest world problems, the continued existence of Saddam Hussein's regime. Some critics of the raids persist in presenting them as an attack pure and simple, whereas they are more properly seen as an attempt to prevent an escalation of the conflict. The American and British governments acted not only to safeguard their servicemen after Iraq upgraded its air defences but also to avert the political and military crisis that would have burst upon us had the Iraqis shot down aircraft and captured pilots. Think of the pressures both for retaliation and for appeasement in that case, the opportunism of third parties rushing in to mediate, the upsurge of emotion in the Arab world, the difficulty of taking rational decisions in such an atmosphere! This danger has been reduced by the raids, but at the same time they show how fragile is a policy which depends on the calculation that we will never lose planes or aircrew, certainly not in any number. Yet the no-fly zones are still the most intact and the most defensible element in the once formidable array of measures to contain Iraq. They provide some protection for the Kurds and for the Kuwaitis, in that as long as they exist Saddam could never be sure of American reaction if he tried to resume full control of the north or if he moved in a big way toward the Kuwaiti border. Those inclined to think of the no-fly zones as disposable should bear in mind the attitude of people like Mahmoud Osman, a Kurdish socialist leader, who told the Guardian this week that he knew of no Kurd who did not want them to continue to be enforced, and the views of the Kuwaitis, so often brushed aside by other Arabs. The no-fly zones also symbolise some degree of resolve. Like sanctions, even in their now vestigial form, they are a way of saying that the Iraqi regime is not a normal government, to be treated in a normal way, and that at no point in the years since the Gulf war ended has it made a single sincere effort to comply with United Nations resolutions. But is a point of principle worth imposing if it causes much human suffering? Here again, events have moved us on from the old arguments. Madeleine Albright became infamous in the Arab world when she replied to questions about the impact of sanctions on Iraqi civilians, especially children, by saying: \"We think the price is worth it.\" But that was before the effect of sanctions had been reduced both by changes in the rules which gave the Iraqi government more income and freedom to trade, and by massive evasions. The critics of sanctions cannot say both that they have become a joke and that they are still, whatever may have been the case in the past, the main cause of the misfortunes of Iraqis. The deterioration in the conditions of life in Iraq must have many causes, notably the devastation that Saddam brought on his country by waging war on Iran. The damage done in the Kuwait war was piled on top of that. A society which for a while had appeared to be flush with funds and which was engaged in pell-mell modernisation and urbanisation, highly dependent on imported items for its infra-structure, suddenly regressed. If it had been less developed, it would have been less damaged. Saddam's government was peculiarly incapable of managing the resulting crisis. Quite apart from the ruthless diversion of funds to military spending, the Iraqi government is neither efficient or fair. It had operated for years a wasteful system of social bribery, selectively rewarding army, party, bureaucracy, and business class. In the old days even the least privileged derived some benefit, and there was typically lavish spending on social services. Indeed the case can be made that Saddam went to war, both with Iran and Kuwait, precisely so he could maintain this profligate style. When this could no longer be done, the circle within which people were sustained and rewarded by the government was redrawn, and those outside duly suffered. Sanctions certainly did not help, but the argument that they were contributory rather than central is strengthened by the fact that there has been no clear improvement in life for ordinary people in Iraq since they were run down. The new American secretary of state, Colin Powell, travelling around the Middle East over the next few days, has the unenviable job of trying to persuade Arab leaders that there can be a common approach to Iraq. But the coalition created at the time of the Gulf war cannot be revived. It was already on its last legs in 1996, when Saddam sent his tanks into Irbil and suffered no consequences, and it expired by late 1998, when the last major American missile onslaught on Iraq went unsupported. Arab governments are motivated by a fear of Saddam and by a fear of their own public opinion, and these fears could only be allayed if they thought the United States was determined to remove Saddam. The Bush administration has not shown such a determination, and, while it may be harder on Iraq than its predecessor, it does not seem likely it will do so. In deed, the US and Britain would probably end sanctions in all but a few categories if Iraq would agree to a restoration of arms inspections, even if those inspections were likely to be superficial. Saddam's desire for the total humiliation of his enemies may nevertheless prevent this happening. Sanctions might have worked, in spite of Saddam's obstinacy, if they had not been quite quickly subverted. As Tim Trevan, a former adviser to the UN special commission for Iraq, wrote in his book \"impatience with sanctions is the best way to ensure they will not work\", while \"increasing support for sanctions over time, as with Rhodesia and South Africa\" can convince a regime that it must buckle under. Iraq, instead, saw sanctions unravelling rather than strengthening as Russia, China, France, and Arab states dropped out. Have sanctions strengthened Saddam, or is it more that weak sanctions have strengthened him? Can it truly be said that he is strengthened at all? It is hard to know, concerning a society as necessarily secretive and devious as Iraq is under Saddam. One may repine over the ineffectiveness of the policies applied to Iraq without quite giving up hope that in some way not visible now Saddam has been undermined, and without wanting to abandon a few measures, some practical and some symbolic, which mark out the Iraqi regime for what it is, a danger to itself, to its neighbours, and to the world. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com Related articles 19.2.2001: Doubts over Iraq air strikes 19.2.2001: Raid shows Bush-Blair bond on Iraq 19.2.2001: No contest in the battle for Arab hearts and minds 16.1.2001: Iraqi sanctions explained Talk about it Iraqi bombing: What do you think?

      "body": "<p>Nestling among Northamptonshire's rolling hills, the pretty village of Ravensthorpe is a good 100 miles from the Essex abattoir at the centre of the foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>But here, as in similar rural communities across the UK, the outbreak is already having a profound effect on the immediate struggles of farmers to make ends meet and on the morale of those who live in the countryside.</p> <p>Farmers, labourers, suppliers and hauliers spent much of yesterday waiting for more news, trying to separate fact from rumour. More than anything they were waiting - fearfully - for confirmation of new outbreaks. Had the Ministry of Agriculture moved swiftly enough to isolate the virus, or was it already advancing across the country? How would their jobs, their livelihoods be affected?</p> <p><b> Exported</b><br></p> <p>The timing could not have been worse for the likes of Trevor and Pat Foss, who farm 200 acres just behind the honey-coloured stone church of St Denys in Ravensthorpe. They are already nurturing 100 early lambs in their rows of neat sheds. The animals will be ready to go to market in a fortnight. With luck the farm will have another 400 lambs by the end of the season. Most would have been exported.</p> <p>As chairman of the region's National Farmers' Union Mr Foss spent yesterday morning at a prearranged meeting of dairy farmers. Naturally enough, talk of foot and mouth disease dominated the tense discussions. A ministry vet turned up to give advice about the precautions that should be taken.</p> <p>Mr Foss, a practical and realistic man, acknowledged that there was great concern but said there was not a sense of panic - at least not yet. He said: \"The farming industry has been through so much in recent years that we've grown used to facing problems. It's a matter of waiting and seeing and hoping.\"</p> <p>More immediately, however, Mr Foss was anxious by late morning yesterday to find out how prices at Northampton market had held up.</p> <p>The news was not good. Three thousand lambs, which would mainly have been destined for the continent, were expected to begin arriving at the market at dawn. In the end only 1,200 were brought in. Prices plummeted. Last week auctioneer Keith Rose was overseeing the sale of lambs at a healthy \u00a31.20 a kilo - between \u00a38 and \u00a312 per animal. Yesterday he could do no better than \u00a31.</p> <p>He did not care to say how much his profits had dropped on only the first market day after the export ban came into force. But he admitted: \"If this isn't resolved quickly, next week's market could be a lot, lot lower. The problem is that 80-85% of this lamb would have been going to France. Now it has to be sold to the home market and that depresses the price. The mood at the market today was, to say the least, rather sombre.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile just up the hill from Ravensthorpe the Pytchley hunt was holding horse trials. \"You haven't come from one of the zones, have you?\" inquired one of the organisers suspiciously. The outbreak - and the setting-up of exclusion zones around Cheale Meats, in Essex, and around farms which had recently delivered meat there - had made the organisers of this popular event understandably edgy. Horses rarely contract foot and mouth disease but can carry it from place to place. Three lorryloads of horses had failed to turn up to the trials because they were too close to the dreaded zones.</p> <p>Bill Saunders, a respected local landowner, was among the crowds watching the event and trying to forget their troubles for a few moments. He has farmed the area for 50 years and is resigned to making a loss on the 150 head of cattle he owns that are ready to go to market. Recent bad weather coupled with the lingering effects of the BSE crisis had already meant that he would scarcely break even on the animals.</p> <p>He said: \"I thought I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Now this. But we are a resilient lot and we will struggle on.\"</p> <p>Many farmers in Ravensthorpe and surrounding villages have given up before now, frustrated by the number of regulations they feel they have to cope with and by what they see as a lack of help and understanding from the government. Those left tend to be determined. So Mr Saunders preferred not to dwell on the unhappy lot of the farmer at present but to think of practical solutions. \"We're all aware that we're going to face restricted movement if this continues. Well it's no good complaining - we're just going to have to make do.\"</p> <p><b> Disastrous</b><br></p> <p>It is not only agriculture that will be hit. The Pytchley hunt will also be affected. Word gradually seeped through during the trials that hunting had been suspended for seven days. The Pytchley will lose two meetings. If, however, the disease spreads and the hunt's money-spinning spring point-to-point had to be cancelled, the consequences could be disastrous. The Pytchley's woodman Dick Threadgold said: \"The impact of something like this can be felt through the whole community. Almost everyone is effected in one way or another.\"</p> <p>Back in the village, lunchtime conversation at the Chequers pub had turned inevitably to farming matters. The village's farmers do not tend to drink in the pub at lunchtime, preferring to arrive after their day's toils, but the non-farming regulars were nevertheless discussing the implications for the area.</p> <p>In a village of only 500 people it is likely that everyone will know someone who will be directly or indirectly affected if the crisis grows.</p> <p>\"It's terribly sad,\" said Janet Green as she scanned the local newspaper's front page outside the village post office. \"We're a tight little community and when something like this happens we are all drawn into it in some way.\"</p> <p><b> Sheep shipment investigation</b><br></p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture was yesterday investigating how a ship loaded with live sheep was apparently allowed to sail from Britain to France on Tuesday night, after discovery of the foot and mouth outbreak. Animal right protesters claim they tracked a lorry from Wales which passed through what has now become an exclusion zone on the Essex section of the M25 and watched as it delivered its live cargo to the dockside at Dover.</p> <p><b> Abattoir sends staff home</b><br></p> <p>Sixty workers at an abattoir near Rhyl, north Wales, were sent home yesterday as the effects of the foot and mouth crisis began to bite.

An expected increase in the estimated cost savings from the group's merger did not materialise - the firm said that it still anticipated annual savings of \u00a31.6bn.",

      "byline": "Paul Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hundreds of people are involved in the priority task of tracking the source of the outbreak of foot and mouth since the disease was first confirmed in the Essex abattoir at Little Warley, near Brentwood, on Tuesday.</p> <p>What would have been a relatively simple task had a single outbreak ocurred on a farm has become a detective task of almost Herculean proportions because it happened in an abattoir.</p> <p>The immediate and logical thought of the Ministry of Agriculture vets investigating was that it probably came from one of the two farms where the sick pigs had been reared. The pigs arrived a Cheale Meats near Brentwood on Friday and become sick on Monday.Logically at least one batch must have been infected before they were delivered.</p> <p>The problem is that none of the stock remaining at either of the two farms - at Great Horwood in Buckinghamshire and Freshwater on the Isle of Wight - have become sick since or shown any signs of the disease.</p> <p>A third possibility - a single pig which arrived at the abattoir via a market at Selby, North Yorkshire, on Sunday is also being investigated. But its 6,500 fellow breeders back at the Yorkshire farm also remain healthy so far.</p> <p>With the virulent type O virus being isolated as the cause of the outbreak, ministry vets were told by the laboratory in Pirbright, Surrey that pigs could catch the disease and within 24 hours show symptoms. This meant that the pigs probably caught the infection in the abattoir rather than at their home farms. It also seemed logical that a bull at a nearby farm that became ill shortly after the pigs had caught the disease was infected by them. It is possible for the virus to carry many miles downwind from pig's breath - but if the wind was in the other direction, the bull could have infected the pigs. But where did the bull get foot and mouth from?</p> <p>Yesterday, with all obvious leads drawing a blank the ministry was facing a long haul. Hundreds of people have now joined the hunt for the virus. Every movement of lorries, full and empty, cars and people visiting the infected abattoir premises in Essex for three weeks before the outbreak is being tracked.</p> <p>This is proving a long task since with fewer but larger abattoirs serving the farming industry batches of animals are delivered to Essex from as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p> <p>Every lorry movement between farms and markets which ultimately led to, or away from, the abattoir also needs to be checked. Computers are being used to check the strength and direction of the wind to find out the potential carrying distance of the virus in the few days before the outbreak. Foot and mouth has travelled 150 miles on a damp wind and conditions were ideal in Essex last week.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has already ordered an investigation into how the virus reached the UK in the first place. Stringent controls are in place on imports from the countries where the disease is endemic or where outbreaks have occurred. Mr Brown said yesterday that in his view something illegal must have occurred for foot and mouth to arrive in Britain.</p> <p>The theory that it has come from infected feed, subsequently incorporated in pig swill, was already being considered on Wednesday. Since the BSE crisis the issue of what farm animals eat has come under closer scrutiny but sloppy practices still exist. It would be a tragic irony if this latest animal health crisis was caused by impoverished farmers trying to squeeze a living by evading the rules on what they can feed their stock.</p> <p>The outbreak of classical swine fever last August went through the same tracing process back to an original breeding farm in Norfolk.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of people are involved in the priority task of tracking the source of the outbreak of foot and mouth since the disease was first confirmed in the Essex abattoir at Little Warley, near Brentwood, on Tuesday. What would have been a relatively simple task had a single outbreak ocurred on a farm has become a detective task of almost Herculean proportions because it happened in an abattoir. The immediate and logical thought of the Ministry of Agriculture vets investigating was that it probably came from one of the two farms where the sick pigs had been reared. The pigs arrived a Cheale Meats near Brentwood on Friday and become sick on Monday.Logically at least one batch must have been infected before they were delivered. The problem is that none of the stock remaining at either of the two farms - at Great Horwood in Buckinghamshire and Freshwater on the Isle of Wight - have become sick since or shown any signs of the disease. A third possibility - a single pig which arrived at the abattoir via a market at Selby, North Yorkshire, on Sunday is also being investigated. But its 6,500 fellow breeders back at the Yorkshire farm also remain healthy so far. With the virulent type O virus being isolated as the cause of the outbreak, ministry vets were told by the laboratory in Pirbright, Surrey that pigs could catch the disease and within 24 hours show symptoms. This meant that the pigs probably caught the infection in the abattoir rather than at their home farms. It also seemed logical that a bull at a nearby farm that became ill shortly after the pigs had caught the disease was infected by them. It is possible for the virus to carry many miles downwind from pig's breath - but if the wind was in the other direction, the bull could have infected the pigs. But where did the bull get foot and mouth from? Yesterday, with all obvious leads drawing a blank the ministry was facing a long haul. Hundreds of people have now joined the hunt for the virus. Every movement of lorries, full and empty, cars and people visiting the infected abattoir premises in Essex for three weeks before the outbreak is being tracked. This is proving a long task since with fewer but larger abattoirs serving the farming industry batches of animals are delivered to Essex from as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland. Every lorry movement between farms and markets which ultimately led to, or away from, the abattoir also needs to be checked. Computers are being used to check the strength and direction of the wind to find out the potential carrying distance of the virus in the few days before the outbreak. Foot and mouth has travelled 150 miles on a damp wind and conditions were ideal in Essex last week. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has already ordered an investigation into how the virus reached the UK in the first place. Stringent controls are in place on imports from the countries where the disease is endemic or where outbreaks have occurred. Mr Brown said yesterday that in his view something illegal must have occurred for foot and mouth to arrive in Britain. The theory that it has come from infected feed, subsequently incorporated in pig swill, was already being considered on Wednesday. Since the BSE crisis the issue of what farm animals eat has come under closer scrutiny but sloppy practices still exist. It would be a tragic irony if this latest animal health crisis was caused by impoverished farmers trying to squeeze a living by evading the rules on what they can feed their stock. The outbreak of classical swine fever last August went through the same tracing process back to an original breeding farm in Norfolk. Yesterday the investigation in ot the source of that outbreak was still continuing, but the most likely theory was that the virus was contained in a sandwich thrown into a pig pen by a passing walker. Tracing the source of foot and mouth is even more complicated because of the range of animals affected. Virtually everything with a cloven hoof - including camels and elephants - plus a few without, like rats, can suffer foot and mouth. Wild animals like deer, which are far more plentiful in the countryside than during the last serious outbreak in 1967, can suffer from the disease and survive to spread it among domestic animals. Horses which often mix with farm animals and are transported around the countryside to hunts and race meetings can carry the disease and not show symptoms so would need to be individually tested. A ministry spokeswoman said: \"This is no easy task. We are proceeding by a process of elimination. There is a huge amount to do and so far we have drawn a blank but we are determined to find the source and we will.\" Talk about it What do you think?

The decision not to proceed against Detective Superintendent Ray Mallon, and colleagues in Cleveland police, provoked a storm of protest last night - with two local MPs publicly falling out over whether the chief constable, Barry Shaw, should resign. The Labour peer Lord MacKenzie, a former president of the Police Superintendents Association, also demanded an investigation into methods adopted by the police complaints authority. Three years after the launch of the operation, codenamed Lancet, into claims that drugs were offered to criminals for information, the crown prosecution service said in a statement there was insufficient evidence for a successful criminal prosecution, although 390 allegations were made. Since the start of the inquiry, 48 files were forwarded to the CPS containing almost 14,000 witness statements, documents and other reports. But Sir Alastair Graham, chairman of the PCA, said last night it was awaiting recommendations from Cleveland police on whether further officers should face disciplinary hearings. \"We will then take the final decision,\" he added. He revealed that two superintendents had already been told they would face disciplinary hearings - with the first to take place in April and the second in June. After Chief Constable Shaw told a meeting of his police authority yesterday why Operation Lancet was started, the authority chairman, Ken Walker, defended the actions of the force. With estimates of the cost of the investigation running up to \u00a37m, he said: \"No one likes the fact that Lancet has taken so long and cost so much, but that should not detract from the fact that it was launched because the chief constable and his senior officers feared that their drive against drugs, and possibly the safety of officers taking on the drug dealers, was being threatened.\" Three years ago Detective Superintendent Mallon was suspended from duty, although last summer he was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.

If he is not careful, George Bush might grab them during their meeting in Washington today, or at Camp David this weekend - only to swap them for his own footwear. That is, after all, what he did with Vicente Fox, president of Mexico and the first foreign leader to receive Mr Bush since he took office: the two men, both ranchers with a fondness for stetsons and denim, sealed their bond of friendship by exchanging cowboy boots.</p> <p>Come to think of it, Mr Blair may not be treated to so chummy a gesture. The new American president has demoted the British PM to third in his batting order of foreign summits and, by putting Mexico first, has clearly signalled his diminished view of Britain's (and Europe's) importance. Both his meagre record of international travel - just three trips outside the US, apart from Mexico, in his adult life - and last year's campaign rhetoric underlined the point: when it comes to the rest of the world, George ain't really that interested.</p> <p>Those are not the only elements that will make Washington a chillier place for Mr Blair than it was on his previous visits. He has an ideological gap to bridge with Mr Bush, too. The bond with Bill Clinton was as much a Labour-Democrat affair as a British-American one: Tony and Bill regarded each other as political soulmates, engaged in parallel struggles to modernise their parties and change their countries. There is no similar force to bind today's pair. Moreover, Mr Bush hails from a party whose animating creed is a suspicion of government - while (on a good day) Mr Blair's mission is to rehabilitate the state as an agent of progressive change. The considerable charm skills of both men will be tested.</p> <p>Which is not to say they will lack things to talk about. Now that they have been jointly blooded in battle, sharing in last week's wrong-headed air strikes near Baghdad, they have a certain amount of male bonding behind them. Since, we are told, they did not discuss the Iraq action directly before they took it, perhaps they can use this weekend to chat about Saddam Hussein and the lonely Anglo-American crusade against him. Maybe Mr Blair may even dare to revive the policy shift Britain's own Foreign Office was mulling before the nostalgic rerun of Operation Desert Storm: a move away from the ineffective and indefensible sanctions regime which punishes Iraq's people and leaves its leader unscathed.</p> <p>That may be too much to hope for. There is certainly no chance of Tony Blair following the advice of some Europhiles, who dream of the day our PM will show two fingers to an American president, telling him that Britain's future lies with Europe instead. It is not going to happen, and nor should it. Mr Blair is right to argue, as he did during his brief stop in Canada yesterday, that the choice between the European Union and the United States is a false one - we can and should stick with both. A close alliance with the world's sole superpower is a British interest and Mr Blair cannot sensibly do other than nurture it.</p> <p>But that does not mean serving only as a faithful lapdog. Instead the prime minister can act this weekend as an emissary from Europe, telling Mr Bush some uncomfortable truths. He might begin by explaining that the Republican flirtation with \"America alone\" notions of unilateralism make no sense; the only way America can play in today's world is as a team, sharing power with its allies. The two-nation solitude of the Iraq offensive is not sustainable for long.</p> <p>Mr Blair can even offer a deal. He might tell Mr Bush that he could help him work out a plan for collective missile defence acceptable to the European allies and others so long as the president tells his top brass, including his hawkish defence secretary, to stop branding the EU's plan for a rapid reaction force a threat to Nato. That would be a useful deal to come home with - and proof that Mr Bush is a man with whom Mr Blair can do business.</p>",

The new American president has demoted the British PM to third in his batting order of foreign summits and, by putting Mexico first, has clearly signalled his diminished view of Britain's (and Europe's) importance. Both his meagre record of international travel - just three trips outside the US, apart from Mexico, in his adult life - and last year's campaign rhetoric underlined the point: when it comes to the rest of the world, George ain't really that interested. Those are not the only elements that will make Washington a chillier place for Mr Blair than it was on his previous visits. He has an ideological gap to bridge with Mr Bush, too. The bond with Bill Clinton was as much a Labour-Democrat affair as a British-American one: Tony and Bill regarded each other as political soulmates, engaged in parallel struggles to modernise their parties and change their countries. There is no similar force to bind today's pair. Moreover, Mr Bush hails from a party whose animating creed is a suspicion of government - while (on a good day) Mr Blair's mission is to rehabilitate the state as an agent of progressive change. The considerable charm skills of both men will be tested. Which is not to say they will lack things to talk about. Now that they have been jointly blooded in battle, sharing in last week's wrong-headed air strikes near Baghdad, they have a certain amount of male bonding behind them. Since, we are told, they did not discuss the Iraq action directly before they took it, perhaps they can use this weekend to chat about Saddam Hussein and the lonely Anglo-American crusade against him. Maybe Mr Blair may even dare to revive the policy shift Britain's own Foreign Office was mulling before the nostalgic rerun of Operation Desert Storm: a move away from the ineffective and indefensible sanctions regime which punishes Iraq's people and leaves its leader unscathed. That may be too much to hope for. There is certainly no chance of Tony Blair following the advice of some Europhiles, who dream of the day our PM will show two fingers to an American president, telling him that Britain's future lies with Europe instead. It is not going to happen, and nor should it. Mr Blair is right to argue, as he did during his brief stop in Canada yesterday, that the choice between the European Union and the United States is a false one - we can and should stick with both. A close alliance with the world's sole superpower is a British interest and Mr Blair cannot sensibly do other than nurture it. But that does not mean serving only as a faithful lapdog. Instead the prime minister can act this weekend as an emissary from Europe, telling Mr Bush some uncomfortable truths. He might begin by explaining that the Republican flirtation with \"America alone\" notions of unilateralism make no sense; the only way America can play in today's world is as a team, sharing power with its allies. The two-nation solitude of the Iraq offensive is not sustainable for long. Mr Blair can even offer a deal. He might tell Mr Bush that he could help him work out a plan for collective missile defence acceptable to the European allies and others so long as the president tells his top brass, including his hawkish defence secretary, to stop branding the EU's plan for a rapid reaction force a threat to Nato. That would be a useful deal to come home with - and proof that Mr Bush is a man with whom Mr Blair can do business.",

He said he aimed to raise prices by about 10% in Britain and by up to 4% in the US, where it earns about 64% of its overall profits. Decline in car values hits Lex Falling car prices wiped \u00a314m off underlying profits of Lex Service last year. Lex, which sold its franchised car dealerships after buying the RAC motoring services business in mid-1999, said its car leasing and importing businesses had been hurt by the \"exceptional fall\" in car values. The company ended the year with underlying profits a third lower at \u00a341.7m. A \u00a345m provision against a further slide in vehicle values left it with a pre-tax loss of \u00a317.5m, against a \u00a3106.2m profit the previous year. British Ports steams ahead Associated British Ports has recorded a 10% increase in full-year profits. Britain's biggest port operator, which has been selling property and other non-core businesses to focus on its main port activities, said that underlying pre-tax profit rose to \u00a3124.3m from \u00a3113.5m a year ago. Group turnover rose 11% to \u00a3390.6m - higher than expected.",

The study, coordinated by the Dutch ministry of justice, shows England and Wales at the top of the world league with Australia as the countries where you are most likely to become a victim of crime. These countries face an annual rate of 58 crimes for every 100 inhabitants. The findings, based on interviews with 35,000 people about their experience of crime across the 17 countries, were carried out last year. They are a blow to Labour's record and underline the challenge facing Tony Blair when he marks the launch of Labour's 10-year anti-crime plan next Monday by becoming the first serving prime minister to visit a prison.

Only 7% in Spain and 12% in France thought he or she should be jailed at all. People were asked whether they had been victims of a range of 11 different offences in the previous 12 months, including violent and sexual assault, car crime, burglary and consumer fraud.

Some 5% of Polish people surveyed said they had had to pay a bribe to a police officer or government official in the previous 12 months. The survey says the results show the industrialised world splitting into three separate groups as far as crime is concerned. High crime countries where more than 24% of the population are victims of crime each year are Australia, England and Wales, the Netherlands and Sweden. Canada, Scotland, Denmark, Poland, Belgium, France and America are medium crime countries where between 20% and 24% are crime victims each year. Low crime countries which have crime victimisation rates below 20% are Finland, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, Japan and Northern Ireland.",

      "body": "<p>Online grocers, once some of the brightest stars in the dot.com firmament, have fallen to earth in the US, decimated by a wave of mergers and closures. </p> <p>Kurt Barnard, president of the Barnard Retail Monitor, said: \"No one has really been able to evolve a model that is capable of producing profits.\" He believes that even fewer consumers will be prepared to pay extra for their groceries to be bagged and delivered now that the US economy has slowed down. </p> <p>Ken Cassar, e-commerce analyst at online research group Jupiter Communications, says that even in areas where local deliveries made sense - wealthy, urban neighbourhoods - the services have suffered from serious traffic congestion during the busiest times. </p> <p>But some analysts remain optimistic. Jupiter forecasts the US online grocery market will increase from an estimated $700m (\u00a3485m) this year to $18.5bn in 2005. At these levels, online deliveries would represent just 3% of the total grocery market. </p> <p>Among the companies that have tried to make online grocery business pay is <a href=\"http://www.webvan.com\">Webvan</a>. Perhaps the best known of online grocers, it has big problems. In the last quarter it annnounced a loss of $109m with full-year losses of $413 - almost double the previous year. </p> <p>The company, which hired George Shaheen, the former head of managment consulting group Anderson Consulting, as its chief executive, has closed some operations and cut jobs to slow the pace at which it is consuming the $200m cash it has left in the bank. Shares of the company have dropped from a 52-week high of $18.50 to a low of 21 cents a share and it faces relegation from the Nasdaq stock market. It delivers more than 15,000 items in 10 US cities and had planned to move into 26 more cities by 2002. </p> <p>Peapod was founded by brothers Andrew and Thomas Parkinson in 1989 after they read that consumers would rather not shop for groceries. Investors pulled the plug last year but Royal Ahold, the Dutch supermarket group, stepped in and now owns 51%. Some 100,000-plus members -largely working mothers - pay monthly dues of $5 plus order and delivery fees. </p> <p>\"No carts, no lines, no hassle\" is the Netgrocer slogan.

      "bodyText": "Online grocers, once some of the brightest stars in the dot.com firmament, have fallen to earth in the US, decimated by a wave of mergers and closures. Kurt Barnard, president of the Barnard Retail Monitor, said: \"No one has really been able to evolve a model that is capable of producing profits.\" He believes that even fewer consumers will be prepared to pay extra for their groceries to be bagged and delivered now that the US economy has slowed down. Ken Cassar, e-commerce analyst at online research group Jupiter Communications, says that even in areas where local deliveries made sense - wealthy, urban neighbourhoods - the services have suffered from serious traffic congestion during the busiest times. But some analysts remain optimistic. Jupiter forecasts the US online grocery market will increase from an estimated $700m (\u00a3485m) this year to $18.5bn in 2005. At these levels, online deliveries would represent just 3% of the total grocery market. Among the companies that have tried to make online grocery business pay is Webvan. Perhaps the best known of online grocers, it has big problems. In the last quarter it annnounced a loss of $109m with full-year losses of $413 - almost double the previous year. The company, which hired George Shaheen, the former head of managment consulting group Anderson Consulting, as its chief executive, has closed some operations and cut jobs to slow the pace at which it is consuming the $200m cash it has left in the bank. Shares of the company have dropped from a 52-week high of $18.50 to a low of 21 cents a share and it faces relegation from the Nasdaq stock market. It delivers more than 15,000 items in 10 US cities and had planned to move into 26 more cities by 2002. Peapod was founded by brothers Andrew and Thomas Parkinson in 1989 after they read that consumers would rather not shop for groceries. Investors pulled the plug last year but Royal Ahold, the Dutch supermarket group, stepped in and now owns 51%. Some 100,000-plus members -largely working mothers - pay monthly dues of $5 plus order and delivery fees. \"No carts, no lines, no hassle\" is the Netgrocer slogan. It may also be close to having no money. The New Jersey-based company uses Federal Express to post its goods. With a promise of delivery to 48 US states within three to four days, the company cannot offer staples such as dairy, meat or frozen foods. Streamline.com, the company which installed refrigerators in customers' garages, closed in November. It had been unable to find any investor willing to continue to stem losses that added up to $56.4m by the beginning of this year. Kozmo and Urbanfetch, two Manhattan delivery services set up within months of each other, took each other to court on alleged espionage charges. Kozmo expanded into several US cities and Urbanfetch into London. Both started to retrench as the downturn kicked in and last year started merger talks which were aborted.",

      "bodyText": "Senior Democrats, many of whom went to Bill Clinton's defence in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, have been lining up to disown him as the political damage to the party caused by the pardons scandal begins to sink in. One of the most savage blows came from the only other living Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, who called the pardon of Marc Rich \"disgraceful\", adding that there was \"no doubt\" that Mr Rich's pardon was \"attributable to his large gifts\". At a time when the party leadership had intended to mount a blistering campaign against President Bush's proposed tax cut and his Alaskan oil exploration plans, it has instead found itself on the defensive. Whereas most Democrats had dismissed Mr Clinton's impeachment as a politically motivated witch-hunt focused on his private life, this time party leaders have been at a loss to think of words to mitigate their erstwhile leader's behaviour. Senator Joseph Biden, who had previously anointed Mr Clinton \"a great president\", called the Rich pardon \"totally indefensible\". Senator Charles Schumer, another impassioned opponent of impeachment, said: \"Pardoning a fugitive stands our justice system on its head and makes a mockery of it.\" Political analysts say the scandal has done significant damage to the party. The leadership had been hoping to win back the evenly balanced Senate and House of Representatives in 2002, by which time they believed the stain of impeachment would have faded. Now the sleaze looks more indelible and the Democrats will find it harder to avoid being defined by the Clinton excesses. Escaping the Clinton shadow has been made all the harder by the elevation of Terry McAuliffe, Mr Clinton's hand-picked candidate and close friend, to the position of party chairman.

It could be the source of the original outbreak of the virus, which has thrown the British farming industry into fresh crisis.</p> <p>The development came as the countryside began to close down, with appeals for ramblers and horse riders to stay away, markets shutting up shop and the suspension of all hunting for a week.</p> <p>The suspected outbreak in Northumberland, at Heddon-on-the-Wall, was traced by the Ministry of Agriculture because the farm had delivered pigs for slaughter to Cheale Meats at Little Warley in Essex, where the virus was first identified on Monday night. When vets arrived at the farm some of the remaining pigs were sick with symptoms similar to foot and mouth but no confirmation has yet been made.</p> <p>Another case of the disease was confirmed in cattle at Great Warley, near Brentwood, inside the 10-mile exclusion zone around the abattoir. The zone had been extended from five miles early yesterday as a precaution. The new case is likely to have been spread by the wind.</p> <p>All movements of animals, lorries and visitors to the Essex slaughterhouse and its neighbouring farm over the past three weeks were being traced yesterday. The investigation involves hundreds of inquiries as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p> <p>The president of the National Farmers Union, Ben Gill, warned: \"The outbreak of foot and mouth could become a disaster if people travel into rural areas. Everyone must be vigilant and journeys into the countryside where there is livestock should not take place.\"</p> <p>Postmen were asked to leave mail at farm gates and farmers were asked to place disinfectant-soaked straw at access points to their land. At agricultural merchant CWG in Bury St Edmunds, Michael Walpole had run out of disinfectant by lunchtime yesterday: \"We have had no notification from Maff [the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] about what to do but we have sold out.

      "bodyText": "A \"highly suspicious\" new case of foot and mouth disease was found last night in pigs at a farm in Northumberland. It could be the source of the original outbreak of the virus, which has thrown the British farming industry into fresh crisis. The development came as the countryside began to close down, with appeals for ramblers and horse riders to stay away, markets shutting up shop and the suspension of all hunting for a week. The suspected outbreak in Northumberland, at Heddon-on-the-Wall, was traced by the Ministry of Agriculture because the farm had delivered pigs for slaughter to Cheale Meats at Little Warley in Essex, where the virus was first identified on Monday night. When vets arrived at the farm some of the remaining pigs were sick with symptoms similar to foot and mouth but no confirmation has yet been made. Another case of the disease was confirmed in cattle at Great Warley, near Brentwood, inside the 10-mile exclusion zone around the abattoir. The zone had been extended from five miles early yesterday as a precaution. The new case is likely to have been spread by the wind. All movements of animals, lorries and visitors to the Essex slaughterhouse and its neighbouring farm over the past three weeks were being traced yesterday. The investigation involves hundreds of inquiries as far away as Northern Ireland and Scotland. The president of the National Farmers Union, Ben Gill, warned: \"The outbreak of foot and mouth could become a disaster if people travel into rural areas. Everyone must be vigilant and journeys into the countryside where there is livestock should not take place.\" Postmen were asked to leave mail at farm gates and farmers were asked to place disinfectant-soaked straw at access points to their land. At agricultural merchant CWG in Bury St Edmunds, Michael Walpole had run out of disinfectant by lunchtime yesterday: \"We have had no notification from Maff [the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] about what to do but we have sold out. I have also pulled all reps from farm calls.\" All hunting by foxhounds, harriers, beagles, and staghounds was suspended for a week after meetings between masters of hunts. The British Horse Association advised riders everywhere to keep to the roads and off farmland. In the Peak District, Bakewell livestock market cancelled a planned sale on Monday. A partner in the market, Alistair Snedden, said the outbreak could have far-reaching consequences for farmers: \"I think the financial and emotional strain could quite simply be too much for some of them.\" The ban on all animal exports, which was imposed on Wednesday night and is costing more than \u00a31m a day, will be in force until Britain controls the spread of the disease, the European commission said. If the source of the contamination were pinpointed the ban could be limited to that region, a spokeswoman said.

We've taken the action necessary to do so, and we will look into the consequences for individual farmers, of how we help them, at a later time.\" As fears spread to the continent, the French government ordered checks on the wind direction across the Channel. The British Veterinary Association said it and Maff had put the country's 14,000 vets on \"red alert\". \"Extreme surveillance is needed,\" said Eifion Evans, past president of the BVA. Main points \u0095 Ramblers advised to cancel all walks in affected counties and stay away from farmland throughout Britain. \u0095 Riders told to keep to roads off bridleways and farmland. \u0095 All hunting voluntarily suspended for a week. \u0095 Farmers asked to place disinfectant-soaked straw at entrances to their farms. \u0095 Postmen delivering to infected farms told to hand mail over at gates. \u0095 Public kept from contact with Epping Forest deer.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown and Clare Short will announce plans on Monday for a multibillion-pound international fund to provide cheap vaccines against childhood diseases to developing countries. The chancellor and international development secretary will use a London conference on children to unveil proposals for the fund, aimed at reducing the 10m deaths each year of children under five. The plan is for the world's richest countries, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) to guarantee a market for drugs produced by the pharmaceutical industry, and subsidise research costs. It is intended to make up lost ground in meeting the aim of reducing world poverty by 2015, set at the UN social summit in Copenhagen in 1995. Mr Brown said in an interview with the Guardian: \"The loss of life is unacceptable ... there is a recognition now that unless we act together and are clear about who takes responsibility, the targets we have set will take longer to meet and in some cases may not be met at all. We are determined to move further and faster towards meeting the UN targets.\" Two weeks ago the Guardian highlighted the problem faced by developing countries which cannot pay the huge bill for drugs needed to fight Aids and other epidemics. Mr Brown believes it is time the G7 most industrialised countries used their influence as the dominant members of the IMF and World Bank to focus their attention on the 2015 targets: to cut infant mortality by two-thirds, put every child in primary school and reduce the number of people living below the breadline by half. Oxfam says child mortality is falling at less than half the rate required to meet the first target: if present trends continue there will be 8.5m child deaths in 2015. The education target is even more in danger unless the G7 takes the initiative next week, and this too will be raised at Monday's conference. The conference, attended by the heads of the World Bank and IMF and addressed by video link by Nelson Mandela and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, will be the first of a series of international meetings highlighting concern for children. Continuing at the spring meetings of the Bank and IMF and the summer meeting of the G7, the progamme will culminate in a special session of the UN. Mr Mandela and his wife Graca Machel are leading a Global Coalition for Children. Mr Brown said that 2001 would be a crucial year. \"This London meeting is the start of the process that I see dominating the international agenda this year.\" To demonstrate his commitment he plans to introduce a tax credit in the Budget to subsidise vaccines research and development. He is also expected to announce tax relief for overseas donations of existing drugs by pharmaceutical companies. The fund to develop new vaccines is likely to include both public and private money, although Mr Brown believes the biggest contribution the private sector can make is to devote more research to the big three killer diseases: malaria, TB and HIV/Aids. At the moment the big pharmaceutical companies devote just 10% of R&amp;D to diseases effecting 90% of the global population. Mr Brown said the government had held private talks with pharmaceutical companies and would put specific proposals to them. \"We are expecting a response from the pharmaceutical industry. It's possible to do more. We must be sure that the pharmaceutical companies are going to do more. \"There is now a view that this is an opportunity that must be taken up. As lives are lost, to delay in taking action is unacceptable.\"",

Two of the three judges indicated that they would have decided against him had they not been bound by earlier Lords rulings, which cannot be overturned by a lower court.

Anderson and Taylor had argued that to allow a politician rather than a judge to perform what was in effect a sentencing exercise was incompatible with the convention and in breach of the Human Rights Act.

Sexual enslavement in armed conflict is now legally acknowledged as a crime against humanity and perpetrators can and must be held to account,\" said Amnesty International in a statement after the decision.</p> <p>The court ruled that the three veterans of the 1992-95 Bosnian war - who stood in silence as the verdict was read out - were guilty of the systematic and savage rape, torture and enslavement of Muslim women in 1992 in the town of Foca in south-eastern Bosnia. They were convicted on 19 separate counts.</p> <p>\"This is the first case where sexual slavery has been charged,\" the UN prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld said yesterday. \"What sets this apart is that this is a case in which we have a large rape camp organisation. This is the first case of sexual enslavement and the only one with sexual assaults and no murders.\"</p> <p>In the past international courts such as the tribunals set up in Nuremberg and Tokyo after the second world war have been reluctant to class wartime rape as a serious crime of war but the Hague tribunal took a much tougher line on the issue.</p> <p>The judgment will give hope to thousands of surviving \"comfort women\" used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers during the second world war who have been fighting in vain for recognition and compensation from the Japanese government.</p> <p>The presiding judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia, described in graphic detail how the three Bosnian Serbs had in the summer of 1992 abducted girls as young as 12 and subjected them to appalling sexual torture in sports halls and a variety of \"rape houses\".</p> <p>\"The three accused are not ordinary soldiers whose morals were merely loosened by the hardships of war. They thrived in the dark atmosphere of the dehumanisation of those believed to be enemies,\" she told the court.</p> <p>\"Rape was used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror,\" the judge concluded at the end of the 11-month trial as she read out the verdict to the three accused.</p> <p>\"You abused and ravaged Muslim women because of their ethnicity and from among their number you picked whomsoever you fancied. You have shown the most glaring disrespect for the women's dignity and their fundamental human rights on a scale that far surpasses even what one might call the average seriousness of rapes during wartime.\"</p> <p>Dragoljub Kunarac, 40, said to have been involved in a \"nightmarish scheme of sexual exploitation\", was given 28 years for rape and torture. Radomir Kovac, 39, was sentenced to 20 years for similar crimes. The third defendant, Zoran Vukovic, 45, was given a sentence of 12 years because prosecutors were able to produce less evidence in his case. He was, nevertheless, convicted of raping and torturing a 15-year-old Muslim girl who was about the same age as his own daughter.</p> <p>The three had looked confident before the judgment was read out, shaking hands with their lawyers, but when the verdict was pronounced Kunarac sank slowly into his seat and shook his head.</p> <p>In Sarajevo a group of Bosnian Muslim women reacted with fury to the sentences, which they regarded as insufficiently tough.</p> <p>\"We are shocked with the verdict. Justice has not been done, as the three received a minimum punishment for what they have done,\" argued Nezira Zolota of the Sarajevo association of former camp inmates.</p> <p>Human rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of Muslim women and girls were systematically raped during the war. Many were deliberately impregnated so as to bear Serbian babies and advance the cause of ethnic cleansing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mass rape and sexual enslavement in time of war will for the first time be regarded as a crime against humanity, a charge second in gravity only to genocide, after a landmark ruling from the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague yesterday which sentenced three Bosnian Serbs to a combined tariff of 60 years in jail. In a judgment that is likely to have far-reaching implications for war crimes trials in Rwanda, Kosovo and East Timor, the tribunal elevated systematic rape from being a mere violation of the customs of war to one of the most heinous war crimes of all - a crime against humanity. \"This verdict is a significant step for women's human rights. Sexual enslavement in armed conflict is now legally acknowledged as a crime against humanity and perpetrators can and must be held to account,\" said Amnesty International in a statement after the decision. The court ruled that the three veterans of the 1992-95 Bosnian war - who stood in silence as the verdict was read out - were guilty of the systematic and savage rape, torture and enslavement of Muslim women in 1992 in the town of Foca in south-eastern Bosnia. They were convicted on 19 separate counts. \"This is the first case where sexual slavery has been charged,\" the UN prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld said yesterday. \"What sets this apart is that this is a case in which we have a large rape camp organisation. This is the first case of sexual enslavement and the only one with sexual assaults and no murders.\" In the past international courts such as the tribunals set up in Nuremberg and Tokyo after the second world war have been reluctant to class wartime rape as a serious crime of war but the Hague tribunal took a much tougher line on the issue. The judgment will give hope to thousands of surviving \"comfort women\" used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers during the second world war who have been fighting in vain for recognition and compensation from the Japanese government. The presiding judge, Florence Mumba of Zambia, described in graphic detail how the three Bosnian Serbs had in the summer of 1992 abducted girls as young as 12 and subjected them to appalling sexual torture in sports halls and a variety of \"rape houses\". \"The three accused are not ordinary soldiers whose morals were merely loosened by the hardships of war. They thrived in the dark atmosphere of the dehumanisation of those believed to be enemies,\" she told the court. \"Rape was used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror,\" the judge concluded at the end of the 11-month trial as she read out the verdict to the three accused. \"You abused and ravaged Muslim women because of their ethnicity and from among their number you picked whomsoever you fancied. You have shown the most glaring disrespect for the women's dignity and their fundamental human rights on a scale that far surpasses even what one might call the average seriousness of rapes during wartime.\" Dragoljub Kunarac, 40, said to have been involved in a \"nightmarish scheme of sexual exploitation\", was given 28 years for rape and torture. Radomir Kovac, 39, was sentenced to 20 years for similar crimes. The third defendant, Zoran Vukovic, 45, was given a sentence of 12 years because prosecutors were able to produce less evidence in his case. He was, nevertheless, convicted of raping and torturing a 15-year-old Muslim girl who was about the same age as his own daughter. The three had looked confident before the judgment was read out, shaking hands with their lawyers, but when the verdict was pronounced Kunarac sank slowly into his seat and shook his head. In Sarajevo a group of Bosnian Muslim women reacted with fury to the sentences, which they regarded as insufficiently tough. \"We are shocked with the verdict. Justice has not been done, as the three received a minimum punishment for what they have done,\" argued Nezira Zolota of the Sarajevo association of former camp inmates. Human rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of Muslim women and girls were systematically raped during the war. Many were deliberately impregnated so as to bear Serbian babies and advance the cause of ethnic cleansing.",

      "body": "<p>In South Africa this week, we learned what is really meant by the term \"angry commuters.\" Broiling with frustration at yet another signal failure causing the cancellation of their trains home, 6,000 of them burned down Pretoria station. Thankfully we in Britain are still at the moaning stage. But the flames of frustration could yet be stoked here, especially if the government's majestic promises to rebuild our decrepit transport system over the next 10 years don't materialise.</p> <p>\"It has been delivery, delivery, delivery,\" said John Prescott at New Labour's last conference. Tell that to Londoners. Nearly four years on, the underground remains one of the most expensive, over-used, underfunded metros in the world. There is continuing deadlock between the mayor's American transport supremo, Bob Kiley, and the government over its public private partnership package. Mr Kiley believes that giving control of the tube's infrastructure to private companies is basically barking. It will not deliver a safe underground and threatens to replicate the mess the privatised rail network has found itself in. Mr Livingstone may yet take the government to court in an attempt to give Mr Kiley overall control.</p> <p>But even if he wins, there might not be much to celebrate, because even the tweaked PPP remains a modest rescue package. We'll be fortunate if the increased capacity it generates keeps pace with forecast passenger growth. In other words we may not notice much difference.</p> <p>What about the rest of Mr Prescott's \"radical\" 10-year plan for Britain which he says will deliver a \"top class\" road, rail and local transport system? For a politician who publicly excoriates spin doctors, his own at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have tried to do a pretty good job. Their press release boasts of the plan as an \"\u00a3180bn investment package\".</p> <p>It's not actually \u00a3180bn - but \u00a3121bn - that meets the Treasury's definition of \"investment\" in the sense that it will buy a new railway or new road, or replace old bits of it; \u00a359bn is old-fashioned public operating subsidy which roads and railways have always needed.</p> <p>Mr Prescott himself has also done some spinning. He says the 10-year plan's \u00a360bn for rail means \"we are getting more rail investment for 10 years than the last 100 years\". Of course this cannot possibly be true. All the new lines, their electrification, all the new engines and coaches, not to mention the \u00a350bn pumped into British Rail between its birth in 1948 and death in 1994, add up to vastly more than \u00a360bn.</p> <p>For roads, the 10-year forecasts for reducing congestion, while allowing for a big increase in traffic, are also less than meet the eye. Overall the plan promises a 6% fall in \"time lost due to congestion\", a simple sounding but highly complex mathematical measurement which Phil Goodwin, professor of transport policy at University College London, says not even ministers understand. So Professor Goodwin - Mr Prescott's chief adviser for his transport white paper - has spent the last several months translating these forecasts into plain English. In many cases, he concludes, despite Mr Prescott's \u00a358.6bn road building programme, travel conditions will worsen. At best, only a few seconds will be shaved off some journeys.</p> <p>And perhaps not even this barely detectable gain will be achieved, for the government's forecasts seem not to have taken account of the disruption that the road building programme will cause. Also, they rely on the rail part of Mr Prescott's 10-year plan being delivered. This is already falling behind schedule and is short of money.</p> <p>Of the \u00a360bn for rail, \u00a326bn comes from the public purse which at 2000/01 prices is only about \u00a32.8bn more public expenditure than was spent over the past decade. However, very little of the plan's remaining \u00a334bn is guaranteed, since this is down to Railtrack and the train and rolling stock companies to raise from the private sector.</p> <p>The success of this PPP largely depends on there being a 51% increase in the number of passengers and 80% increase in freight. Only by generating this extra revenue might the financial markets be persuaded to loan the many billions required to increase the capacity of the presently over stretched network by resignalling and building new lines and stations.</p> <p>These were the assumptions, which last July Mr Prescott described as \"realistic\", underpinning the 10-year plan before Railtrack managed to bring a functioning railway to its knees with the crash at Hatfield in October, five and a half years after privatisation. \"Realistic\" is not how these assumptions seem post-Hatfield, a crash that will cost Railtrack many hundreds of millions in compensation and restoring the 20,000-kilometre network to a state that is no better than it was when Railtrack became its custodians in 1994. Next year's profits are already blown.</p> <p>Railtrack is now so broke it has been seriously contemplating scrapping up to \u00a36bn worth of projects scheduled for the first half of the 10-year plan. Even then, its debt by 2003 is projected at \u00a38bn and according to Deutsche Bank, a staggering \u00a314.5bn by 2006. Banking covenants on this level of debt would require Railtrack to cover its more than \u00a31bn annual interest payments with pre-tax operating profits of around \u00a32.5bn. This is fantasy.</p> <p>So, if Mr Prescott is to deliver his plan, it looks as if the chancellor will have to spend quite a bit more of his surplus to ensure that the public bit of the PPP becomes the dominant partner. If the 10-year plan's finances seem shaky, so does its timetable. Save for the upgrading of the West Coast Mainline and the Channel Tunnel Rail link, the details of most of the remaining projects have yet to be crunched by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), the new fragment Mr Prescott has added to an already fragmented railway. Orchestrating the expansion of stations, new freight lines, the needs of commuter services, interspersed with many more higher speed trains traversing an overpopulated country, all stitched together by legal contract through a multitude of different franchises, is a task of the most enormous complexity. The SRA's \"strategic plan\" was first promised last autumn. This was delayed to January, then February. Now there's just an \"agenda\" for the plan, it having been further delayed to this autumn.</p> <p>In 1997 Mr Prescott said he would have failed \"if in five years' time there are not more people using public transport and far fewer journeys by car. It is a tall order but I want you to hold me to it\". The BBC's transport correspondent, Simon Montague, recently tried to do just that in a BBC Online interview with Lord Macdonald, the transport minister.

      "bodyText": "In South Africa this week, we learned what is really meant by the term \"angry commuters.\" Broiling with frustration at yet another signal failure causing the cancellation of their trains home, 6,000 of them burned down Pretoria station. Thankfully we in Britain are still at the moaning stage. But the flames of frustration could yet be stoked here, especially if the government's majestic promises to rebuild our decrepit transport system over the next 10 years don't materialise. \"It has been delivery, delivery, delivery,\" said John Prescott at New Labour's last conference. Tell that to Londoners. Nearly four years on, the underground remains one of the most expensive, over-used, underfunded metros in the world. There is continuing deadlock between the mayor's American transport supremo, Bob Kiley, and the government over its public private partnership package. Mr Kiley believes that giving control of the tube's infrastructure to private companies is basically barking. It will not deliver a safe underground and threatens to replicate the mess the privatised rail network has found itself in. Mr Livingstone may yet take the government to court in an attempt to give Mr Kiley overall control. But even if he wins, there might not be much to celebrate, because even the tweaked PPP remains a modest rescue package. We'll be fortunate if the increased capacity it generates keeps pace with forecast passenger growth. In other words we may not notice much difference. What about the rest of Mr Prescott's \"radical\" 10-year plan for Britain which he says will deliver a \"top class\" road, rail and local transport system? For a politician who publicly excoriates spin doctors, his own at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have tried to do a pretty good job. Their press release boasts of the plan as an \"\u00a3180bn investment package\". It's not actually \u00a3180bn - but \u00a3121bn - that meets the Treasury's definition of \"investment\" in the sense that it will buy a new railway or new road, or replace old bits of it; \u00a359bn is old-fashioned public operating subsidy which roads and railways have always needed. Mr Prescott himself has also done some spinning. He says the 10-year plan's \u00a360bn for rail means \"we are getting more rail investment for 10 years than the last 100 years\". Of course this cannot possibly be true. All the new lines, their electrification, all the new engines and coaches, not to mention the \u00a350bn pumped into British Rail between its birth in 1948 and death in 1994, add up to vastly more than \u00a360bn. For roads, the 10-year forecasts for reducing congestion, while allowing for a big increase in traffic, are also less than meet the eye. Overall the plan promises a 6% fall in \"time lost due to congestion\", a simple sounding but highly complex mathematical measurement which Phil Goodwin, professor of transport policy at University College London, says not even ministers understand. So Professor Goodwin - Mr Prescott's chief adviser for his transport white paper - has spent the last several months translating these forecasts into plain English. In many cases, he concludes, despite Mr Prescott's \u00a358.6bn road building programme, travel conditions will worsen. At best, only a few seconds will be shaved off some journeys. And perhaps not even this barely detectable gain will be achieved, for the government's forecasts seem not to have taken account of the disruption that the road building programme will cause. Also, they rely on the rail part of Mr Prescott's 10-year plan being delivered. This is already falling behind schedule and is short of money. Of the \u00a360bn for rail, \u00a326bn comes from the public purse which at 2000/01 prices is only about \u00a32.8bn more public expenditure than was spent over the past decade. However, very little of the plan's remaining \u00a334bn is guaranteed, since this is down to Railtrack and the train and rolling stock companies to raise from the private sector. The success of this PPP largely depends on there being a 51% increase in the number of passengers and 80% increase in freight. Only by generating this extra revenue might the financial markets be persuaded to loan the many billions required to increase the capacity of the presently over stretched network by resignalling and building new lines and stations. These were the assumptions, which last July Mr Prescott described as \"realistic\", underpinning the 10-year plan before Railtrack managed to bring a functioning railway to its knees with the crash at Hatfield in October, five and a half years after privatisation. \"Realistic\" is not how these assumptions seem post-Hatfield, a crash that will cost Railtrack many hundreds of millions in compensation and restoring the 20,000-kilometre network to a state that is no better than it was when Railtrack became its custodians in 1994. Next year's profits are already blown. Railtrack is now so broke it has been seriously contemplating scrapping up to \u00a36bn worth of projects scheduled for the first half of the 10-year plan. Even then, its debt by 2003 is projected at \u00a38bn and according to Deutsche Bank, a staggering \u00a314.5bn by 2006. Banking covenants on this level of debt would require Railtrack to cover its more than \u00a31bn annual interest payments with pre-tax operating profits of around \u00a32.5bn. This is fantasy. So, if Mr Prescott is to deliver his plan, it looks as if the chancellor will have to spend quite a bit more of his surplus to ensure that the public bit of the PPP becomes the dominant partner. If the 10-year plan's finances seem shaky, so does its timetable. Save for the upgrading of the West Coast Mainline and the Channel Tunnel Rail link, the details of most of the remaining projects have yet to be crunched by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), the new fragment Mr Prescott has added to an already fragmented railway. Orchestrating the expansion of stations, new freight lines, the needs of commuter services, interspersed with many more higher speed trains traversing an overpopulated country, all stitched together by legal contract through a multitude of different franchises, is a task of the most enormous complexity. The SRA's \"strategic plan\" was first promised last autumn. This was delayed to January, then February. Now there's just an \"agenda\" for the plan, it having been further delayed to this autumn. In 1997 Mr Prescott said he would have failed \"if in five years' time there are not more people using public transport and far fewer journeys by car. It is a tall order but I want you to hold me to it\". The BBC's transport correspondent, Simon Montague, recently tried to do just that in a BBC Online interview with Lord Macdonald, the transport minister. But the Scottish TV tycoon, ennobled by Mr Blair to bring a steadying hand to transport, said his boss had been misunderstood. The challenge Mr Prescott had set himself was not to deliver a reduction in congestion, but a reduction in its growth. Expectations, having been raised, are now being massaged down. Overspun plans whose benefits have been undetectable in this government, may barely be detectable in the next. \"Cry Pretoria\" could yet become the rallying call for Surbiton and Woking. \u0095 John Ware is a BBC Panorama reporter. comment@theguardian.com",

He told me he was looking forward to an exciting cine-related weekend. \"Going to the pictures?\" I inquired. \"Curling up with a few videos?\" \"Nope,\" he replied. \"I'm going to watch the American DVD of Married to the Mob and listen to Jonathan Demme's audio commentary! I've been looking forward to this all week!\" </p> <p>At the time I hadn't laid eyes on a DVD, much less paid attention to their \"additional features\". To be honest, the whole thing seemed a little suspect. Wasn't this yet another consumer durable we didn't need, being test-marketed on obsessives? </p> <p>Well, now I am an obsessive, too - an obsessive producer of DVDs. In the last 12 months, I have done six. In two cases, the American DVD of Repo Man and the British release of Sid &amp; Nancy, my involvement was peripheral. I turned up at the appointed hour and participated in an \"audio commentary\" \u00e0 la Demme. In four, though, I have put together the package - a new digital master of the film; additional material such as shorts and documentaries; screenplays and soundtrack music; and, of course, the \"audio commentary\". </p> <p>The process of recording these is simple. The director sits watching a video of a film made, usually, several years previously. As the film plays, he or she is expected sagely to regale a microphone with anecdotes about the making of the film. It helps if the director has managed to snag someone as \"back-up\" - the producer, the writer, an actor or the composer. Quite often, their recollections will be completely different. And if two are present, the likelihood of both nodding off during a longueur is halved. </p> <p>If they are sufficiently loquacious, all is well. If not, the recording has to be done in stages so that the \"turns\" can be prompted/woken up/given more drink. My digital crop consists of Straight to Hell (1987), Highway Patrolman (1991), Death and the Compass (1996) and Three Businessmen (1998). In addition to the above-mentioned features, in Britain you get: a documentary about the fate of those who appeared in Straight to Hell; video promos for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by the Pogues, and Did You Evah? by Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop; an alternate version of Borges's story Death and the Compass, entitled Spiderweb; and the screenplays of all four films, on CD. </p> <p>Are these DVDs worth it? It would clearly be cheaper to buy a VHS copy or just tape the films off the telly. I think, in the ideal instance, DVD \"additional elements\" can provide some sort of film literacy, even insight. More importantly, perhaps, they represent the Return of the Director, an endangered species rarely glimpsed in recent years. One reason most English-language films are so bad is that they are written by committee, test-marketed by consultants and tweaked by the producer or distributor long after the director has gone. The idea that a film director is an \"author\" is maintained by a tiny band of believers: the Directors' Guild, people who live in Paris, and (at least for now) the buyers of DVDs. </p> <p>Because, for a DVD to be worth purchasing, it must have its additional elements. First among these is the \"director's commentary\". Wonder of wonders! Directors, who have been treated as ingrates or nuisances by the studios, are suddenly in demand again. This is promising, and I'm delighted to participate. I wasn't able to supply another big DVD element for all films, though: the expanded version, or \"director's cut\". Four are already director's cuts. Only Straight to Hell underwent any serious re-jigging. When I tried to re-incorporate scenes, they didn't work.

      "body": "<p>After Bohumil Hrabal fell to his death in 1997 while feeding pigeons from a hospital window, the obituaries rightly described him as the most important Czech writer of his generation. He used to hold court over a pint of beer at his favourite Prague pub - At the Golden Tiger - which, before Hrabal's death, had become a port of call for visiting dignitaries, Bill Clinton among them. Hrabal had proved to be a legend in his own lifetime. </p> <p>For a long time his work was considered untranslatable and represented in English only by Closely Observed Trains. Jiri Menzel's film adaptation won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1967 and is still the best known - and best remembered - of all Czech films. While eight of Hrabal's books have now been translated, it is memories of that \"old movie\", reinforced by TV screenings, that still prevail. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it seems odd that Hrabal's importance to cinema has been severely under-rated. In addition to the forthcoming I Served the King of England, his work has led to eight film adaptations: Pearls of the Deep (1965), Closely Observed Trains (1966), Larks on a String (1969, released in 1990), Cutting it Short (1980), The Snowdrop Festival (1983), Tender Barbarian (1989), Angel Eyes (1994), and Too Loud a Solitude (1995). The first four of these will be enjoying a short British tour over the next month. </p> <p>While Hrabal's largely unpublished pre-war work had come under the influence of the avant-garde, his experience of the Nazi occupation and of postwar Stalinism was to lead in other directions. A graduate in law, his life as a railway linesman and train dispatcher at the Kladno iron works and, after injury, as a wastepaper baler, gave him a rich resource from the everyday. The direct life experience, he concluded, could become a poetic act. </p> <p>His first published work focused on ordinary people, outsiders and misfits. The privately published People's Conversations (1956) revealed his obsession with authentic speech in a representation of the working class at odds with the simplifications of communist ideology. In searching for \"the little pearl at the bottom\", he appeared to have tapped into the suppressed consciousness of an era. </p> <p>Based on Hrabal's collection of short stories, first published in 1963, the five episodes of the 1965 film Pearls of the Deep came to be regarded as the manifesto of the new generation of Czech film-makers, now universally known as the Czech new wave. The emphasis on conversations is apparent in Jan Nemec's section, Imposters, where two old men on the brink of death construct artificial pasts in which one claims to have been a successful opera singer and the other a famous journalist. In Jiri Menzel's The Death of Mr Balthazar, his film debut, set at a motorcycle race meeting, a conversation is constructed entirely from motorcycle lore (make, cubic capacity, year of manufacture) interspersed with the sounds of passing engines. The autobiographical origins of Hrabal's work are apparent in At the World Cafeteria, Vera Chytilova's contribution. It's set in a cafe near his flat, which includes a wedding and a corpse, and features his friend, the \"explosionalist\" artist Vladimir Boudnik. In Jaromil Jires's Romance, the film evokes the relationship Hrabal once had with a young gypsy girl. In Evald Schorm's House of Joy, two insurance salesmen (another of Hrabal's jobs) attempt to interest a primitive painter, whose visions come from inside him \"like the inside of a goat\". </p> <p>This obstinate investigation of reality was, of course, a characteristic of many Czech films of the time, such as Milos Forman's A Blonde in Love and The Firemen's Ball, and Ivan Passer's Intimate Lighting. But while they shared the irony and absurdity of Hrabal, they lacked his obsession with the eccentric. </p> <p>In Closely Observed Trains (the novel), Hrabal constructed his most orthodox narrative, drawing from a number of earlier works based on wartime experiences, two of them dealing with the subject of suicide. While his new emphasis lay on the hero's quest for sexual initiation, he retained much of the originals' taste for morbid imagery. Jiri Menzel's films, however, tend to be explicitly humanist. It is not surprising that the hero no longer sits down on a dead horse and his sexual triumph is no longer lit by the allied firebombing of Dresden. Hrabal, however, drew the line at a happy ending. The film's adolescent hero becomes an assistant at a sleepy railway station. An unsuccessful night of love with his girlfriend leads to attempted suicide in a brothel, the discovery of his \"problem\" (premature ejaculation), and final success in the arms of the glamorous resistance fighter, Viktoria Freie. </p> <p>This theme is complemented by the observation of the station staff: the station guard, an \"immoral fellow\" who entertains young women at night; the station master, who keeps pigeons and dreams of becoming an inspector; the telegraphist who allows the guard to stamp her backside (the favourite clip); and the old porter who ignores minor jobs and dreams of the past. This typical Hrabalian focus is given a poetic charge through characterisation and image, and interwoven with the realities of the German occupation to create a complex and resonant movie. Thefilm's conclusion - in which death, laughter, sentiment and subversion combine - is probably unique in cinema. </p> <p>Menzel and Hrabal's next collaboration was Larks on a String, completed in 1969, but not released until after the fall of communism 20 years later. Of the many films banned after the suppression of the Prague Spring, its confrontation with Stalinism made it one of the most controversial. The setting is a scrap-metal yard, where remnants of the bourgeoisie are enjoying the benefits of re-education through forced labour. The \"counter revolutionaries\" - \"faces soaked in imperialism\" - include a librarian who refused to destroy books, a prosecuting attorney who insisted upon applying the law, a saxophonist who played decadent music, and a hairdresser who refused to work on Saturdays for religious reasons. </p> <p>Their communist supervisor, who displays a somewhat remote acquaintance with the realities of physical labour, is more skilled in the art of denunciation. References to the glorious future are amplified by events such as the polka in honour of a record smeltdown. The romantic vision of things to come is constantly juxtaposed with the seedy realities of the police state. Despite its subject, Menzel adopts an apparently incongruous lyricism and humanity, and a delicate and underplayed comedy. </p> <p>After 1968, Hrabal, who had supported the Prague Spring, was not allowed to publish again until 1976, when his 1970 novella Cutting It Short appeared. An evocation of his childhood memories of the provincial town of Nymburk, it presented the authorities with few problems. Here Hrabal himself emphasised the lyrical touch, a search for a time \"filled with the joyful discovery of the world\". Menzel and Hrabal turned it into a film in 1981. </p> <p>The heroine, Maryska, is the personification of female sexuality. Her presence gives quiet pleasure to the inhabitants of a provincial town dominated by the local brewery. The film's comedy is triggered by the arrival of uncle Pepin, a character based on Hrabal's real uncle Pepin, a former cobbler who came for a two-week visit and stayed for 40 years. \"He sat there at the table and stared at the ceiling and saw what he was talking about up there. He merely reproduced it,\" wrote Hrabal. Pepin's spontaneous narrations were to exercise a key influence on Hrabal's work. In the film, his stories deal with pet raccoons, Austrian officers, aunts and uncles, and dentists who pull out one another's teeth. </p> <p>In 1983, Menzel and Hrabal collaborated on the more sombre The Snowdrop Festival and, in 1989, Menzel acted in Petr Koliha's adaptation of Hrabal's Tender Barbarian. The film told the story of Vladimir Boudnik, and Menzel played the part of \"the doctor\", based on Hrabal himself. In the post-communist period, Menzel's much publicised attempts to set up I Served the King of England came to nothing. In 1998, at the Karlovy Vary film festival, he beat his producer in public with a big stick after he had sold on the rights. The stick was auctioned to admirers. Menzel, who once described the privatisation of the film industry as licensed robbery, has retreated to theatre, unwilling to face the struggles of the \"free\" market. His peculiarly sympathetic and at times magical partnership with Hrabal has become a chapter in history. </p> <p>I Served the King of England has not, however, ended up as the TV soap opera once threatened. It has been taken on by the successful director-screenwriting partnership of Jan Hrebejk and Petr Jarchovsky, whose latest film, Divided We Fall, has been nominated for the best foreign-language film Oscar. </p> <p>But Hrabal's fantastic story of an apprentice waiter from the 1930s to the communist takeover was written at one stretch without reworking the spontaneity of its images. While it will require the compromises of the modern film industry, as Closely Observed Trains once showed, Hrabal's wit and enthusiasm for eccentricity can survive whatever roughness is thrown its way. </p> <p>A selection of Hrabal films plays at the Riverside Studios, London, on February 23 and March 4 (box office: 020-8237 1111), then tours until March 25.

This theme is complemented by the observation of the station staff: the station guard, an \"immoral fellow\" who entertains young women at night; the station master, who keeps pigeons and dreams of becoming an inspector; the telegraphist who allows the guard to stamp her backside (the favourite clip); and the old porter who ignores minor jobs and dreams of the past. This typical Hrabalian focus is given a poetic charge through characterisation and image, and interwoven with the realities of the German occupation to create a complex and resonant movie. Thefilm's conclusion - in which death, laughter, sentiment and subversion combine - is probably unique in cinema. Menzel and Hrabal's next collaboration was Larks on a String, completed in 1969, but not released until after the fall of communism 20 years later. Of the many films banned after the suppression of the Prague Spring, its confrontation with Stalinism made it one of the most controversial. The setting is a scrap-metal yard, where remnants of the bourgeoisie are enjoying the benefits of re-education through forced labour. The \"counter revolutionaries\" - \"faces soaked in imperialism\" - include a librarian who refused to destroy books, a prosecuting attorney who insisted upon applying the law, a saxophonist who played decadent music, and a hairdresser who refused to work on Saturdays for religious reasons. Their communist supervisor, who displays a somewhat remote acquaintance with the realities of physical labour, is more skilled in the art of denunciation. References to the glorious future are amplified by events such as the polka in honour of a record smeltdown. The romantic vision of things to come is constantly juxtaposed with the seedy realities of the police state. Despite its subject, Menzel adopts an apparently incongruous lyricism and humanity, and a delicate and underplayed comedy. After 1968, Hrabal, who had supported the Prague Spring, was not allowed to publish again until 1976, when his 1970 novella Cutting It Short appeared. An evocation of his childhood memories of the provincial town of Nymburk, it presented the authorities with few problems. Here Hrabal himself emphasised the lyrical touch, a search for a time \"filled with the joyful discovery of the world\". Menzel and Hrabal turned it into a film in 1981. The heroine, Maryska, is the personification of female sexuality. Her presence gives quiet pleasure to the inhabitants of a provincial town dominated by the local brewery. The film's comedy is triggered by the arrival of uncle Pepin, a character based on Hrabal's real uncle Pepin, a former cobbler who came for a two-week visit and stayed for 40 years. \"He sat there at the table and stared at the ceiling and saw what he was talking about up there. He merely reproduced it,\" wrote Hrabal. Pepin's spontaneous narrations were to exercise a key influence on Hrabal's work. In the film, his stories deal with pet raccoons, Austrian officers, aunts and uncles, and dentists who pull out one another's teeth. In 1983, Menzel and Hrabal collaborated on the more sombre The Snowdrop Festival and, in 1989, Menzel acted in Petr Koliha's adaptation of Hrabal's Tender Barbarian. The film told the story of Vladimir Boudnik, and Menzel played the part of \"the doctor\", based on Hrabal himself. In the post-communist period, Menzel's much publicised attempts to set up I Served the King of England came to nothing. In 1998, at the Karlovy Vary film festival, he beat his producer in public with a big stick after he had sold on the rights. The stick was auctioned to admirers. Menzel, who once described the privatisation of the film industry as licensed robbery, has retreated to theatre, unwilling to face the struggles of the \"free\" market. His peculiarly sympathetic and at times magical partnership with Hrabal has become a chapter in history. I Served the King of England has not, however, ended up as the TV soap opera once threatened. It has been taken on by the successful director-screenwriting partnership of Jan Hrebejk and Petr Jarchovsky, whose latest film, Divided We Fall, has been nominated for the best foreign-language film Oscar. But Hrabal's fantastic story of an apprentice waiter from the 1930s to the communist takeover was written at one stretch without reworking the spontaneity of its images. While it will require the compromises of the modern film industry, as Closely Observed Trains once showed, Hrabal's wit and enthusiasm for eccentricity can survive whatever roughness is thrown its way. A selection of Hrabal films plays at the Riverside Studios, London, on February 23 and March 4 (box office: 020-8237 1111), then tours until March 25. Details: 020-7291 9920.",

      "body": "<p>Oscar nominated and fresh from a fling with Meg Ryan, Russell Crowe has entered the golden zone, what Don DeLillo called the \"devouring neon\" of true fame. On the second floor of London's Dorchester Hotel, people crane like meerkats for a better view. This was George Clooney three years ago, Mark Wahlberg after Boogie Nights, Tom Cruise during Top Gun mania: an actor in the jaws of the vast, public appetite. </p> <p>Two hours later than scheduled, a rustle moves through the room and there he is: a 36-year-old Australian with wavy hair, a Jesus beard and the beginnings of a paunch. </p> <p>I should declare an interest: the performance of Russell Crowe's pectoral muscles was a big factor in my enthusiasm for the film Gladiator. He is not classically attractive. Even at his best, he looks as if he has just stepped out of economy class after a flight from Bangkok. This, however, is beside the point. The over-egged integrity of such roles as Jeffrey Wigand, tobacco industry whistleblower in The Insider; Bud White, good cop in LA Confidential; and Maximus Decimus Meridius (breast-plated strong man who weeps for his slain wife on the dusty hills of Spain) has made Crowe the subject of mass fascination. My friend Rachel knows his star sign and has taken every compatibility test the Crowe fan sites have thrown at her. She is 31. She has bought the calendar. That she and Crowe will never marry is an occasional - but genuine - source of sorrow to her. </p> <p>In his latest film, Proof of Life, Crowe plays an ex-SAS soldier working to recover Meg Ryan's husband, an engineer kidnapped by rebels (or \"narco-guerrillas\" as the film-makers put it) in \"Tecala\", a fictional South American country. It is the film Russ and Meg met on. Meg plays Alice, a cheerful hippy in the minutes before everything goes pear-shaped. Before her husband Peter is snatched, they have a big row about priorities, then it's over to Russell, who is shown to be both cerebral (working a laptop) and physical (working a grenade-launcher). And, for once, he is permitted to play one of his own countrymen. </p> <p>The director is Taylor Hackford (Officer and a Gentleman, Devil's Advocate) a man who describes Crowe as a \"very difficult and thorny individual, who asks a lot and gives a lot\". The relationship Crowe and Ryan embarked upon in the wake of the film had, says Hackford with weird candour, \"an indelible and destructive effect that overpowered the release of the film in the United States.\" (Proof of Life tanked.) </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, told of Hackford's remarks about him, Crowe responds with equally startling frankness: \"What a fucking idiot. That's what he said? What a knob.\" The press officers in the room reach for their smelling salts and the place erupts. </p> <p>Suddenly it fits into place. This is what we love about Crowe. He can play a generic Hollywood role like Maximus, but he is not himself a Hollywood creation. For those who find Clooney too unpalatably manufactured, Affleck too dewy-eyed, Wahlberg too perfectly buff, Crowe is an antidote. He is honest and unspun. There is even a bit of lard going on under his - yikes! - much-photographed lumberjack shirt. He is the kind of star you imagine you could introduced to your neighbourhood without sending the house prices up. \"I'm not driven by people's praise or slowed down by people's criticism,\" he says. \"I try to keep a sense of humour about\" - he indicates the press corps - \"but there's so much bollocks, you just have to let it slide.\" </p> <p>Eighteen months ago, when Taylor Hackford cast Proof of Life, Crowe was nowhere. He had filmed Gladiator and The Insider but neither had been released. Warner Bros told Hackford to get a grip and find someone famous. \"But I had seen the unedited versions of Gladiator and The Insider,\" says Hackford. \"I thought, 'Here is an actor who can portray a lot without saying a lot.' You can put actors in gladiatorial armour and they'll shrink to the size of a pygmy. Russell didn't. He held the screen.\" </p> <p>I myself first noticed him 10 years ago in a Channel 4 mini-series called Brides of Christ. He played a mechanic sent to Vietnam with the Australian army. He was cute, back then, but weedy. He popped up in Neighbours in 1987, but his character, Kenny, was shortlived. He tried for a music career, playing under the name Rus Le Roc, and released a single called I Want to Be Like Marlon Brando. </p> <p>His first break in acting was an Australian film called Romper Stomper, which brought him to the attention of Sharon Stone and, after starring in her self-produced western, The Quick and the Dead, he was in the right place at the right time to be cast for the role of Bud in LA Confidential, one of the most highly praised films of 1997. </p> <p>So he is still fairly new to the airless, upper reaches of fame; his disgust is palpable. \"That's terrible,\" he says, genuinely aggrieved, when a reporter asks if he would move to LA for a better sex life. \"I thought it was about love.\" He interrupts himself a moment later to finish her off. \"You really are awful.\" </p> <p>What few Australian actors there are in Crowe's league we tend to regard as surrogate Americans: the Mel Gibsons or Nicole Kidmans. But Crowe is emphatically not American, at pains to point out his citizenship of a Commonwealth nation. The SAS, he says, is the \"highest level of military service in the English-speaking world\". The Baftas, ever the poor relation to Oscar, are something he hotly defends. \"I'm from a Commonwealth country,\" he repeats. \"Getting a nomination from the British Academy is equally important to getting an American nomination.\" </p> <p>And, in matters of lifestyle, he hasn't yet got the hang of A-list living. On the Ecuadorian set of Proof of Life, while the cast and crew stayed in a hotel in town, Crowe set up camp on the isolated, hillside site where they were shooting. \"I made a barbecue out of an oil can,\" he says. \"I stole some food from the caterers. Everyone said, 'Are you mad?' There are wildcats around here. I said I'd take the wildcats over the Ecuadorian drivers.\" He compares the idea of living in LA to \"unrolling my swag in the office. I don't think it would be healthy.\" </p> <p>Proof of Life is also the first American film in which Crowe has been permitted to speak in his own accent. His character, Terry Thorne, was was initially written as a Brit, but after learning that Australians and New Zealanders served in the SAS, Crowe canvassed Hackford to let him keep his accent. \"What I enjoyed about having my own speaking voice was that it gave me a clean and easy attitude to the character. There was no limp, no eye patch, no tricks. When I read the script, I thought he was a sentient man, a staunch fella. Hey, Maximus was supposed to be Spanish, but turned out Royal Shakespeare Company two pints after lunch.\" </p> <p>If the film did badly in the US, Crowe says, it was because it was released at the wrong time (\"I wouldn't see a hostage film at Christmas\"), and because of a reluctance to confront awkward truths that kept American audiences away from The Insider. Bad publicity surrounding his and Ryan's relationship - now over - was irrelevant, he says. \"The ending of Meg's prior relationship had nothing to do with me. Meg Ryan is a beautiful and courageous woman. I grieve the loss of her companionship, but I haven't lost her friendship. We still phone each other for a good chat.\" </p> <p>Of all the pre-production training Crowe has had to do - lifting weights for Gladiator and Proof of Life, learning maths for his next role as a schizophrenic mathematician in Beautiful Mind - the most enjoyable has been that which put him in the role of Jeffrey Wigand, the middle aged, podgy businessman in The Insider. \"I had a medically-controlled diet of bourbon and cheeseburgers,\" he says, before telling us, with a delightful disregard for etiquette, that this is the favourite of his recycled quotes. </p> <p>Fame, speculation, adulation - for Crowe, it comes down to this: \"I don't feel under pressure to live up to anyone. Things haven't changed fundamentally. I'm still the same arsehole I was three years ago.\" </p> <p>Proof of Life is released next Friday.</p>",

      "byline": "Adam Sweeting",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Among the many extraordinary achievements in Ennio Morricone's career, two in particular stand out. Firstly, he has composed the scores of more than 400 films, including several of the best-known ever written. Secondly, he has never won an Oscar. Maybe that will change this year, with Morricone's nomination for his score for Malena. But, since he's up against the likes of Gladiator and The Patriot, he isn't holding his breath. </p> <p>Quite how the Academy has managed to overlook a man who has been one of the defining influences on film music for the past 40 years must remain as bewildering as its determination to equip Tom Hanks with a shooting gallery of statuettes; but Morricone wasn't the only one who felt that his luck must surely be in on Oscar night 1986, when his score for The Mission was nominated. </p> <p>\"I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission,\" he declares, holding court in the classical splendour of his spacious Rome apartment. \"Especially when you consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft! But, of course, if it was up to me, every two years I would win an Oscar.\" </p> <p>Settling back on his sofa in a woollen sports shirt, tortoiseshell glasses and slip-on loafers, Morricone appears to be a fragile 72-year-old; but since he's capable of launching into passionate outbursts, during which he semaphores with his arms while bouncing enthusiastically up and down, this may be an elaborate disguise. The maestro's tone is ironic, and I'm having his conversation translated to me from Italian, so it's difficult to gauge the precise extent of the outrage he feels towards the cloth-eared Californians. Maybe if he'd been content to keep running variations on A Fistful of Dollars, or his agonisingly beautiful score for Once Upon a Time in the West, there would now be a row of Oscars on his mantelpiece instead of the tasteful array of blue-and-white ceramic vessels. But he has prided himself on evolving his music over the decades, and would die of shame rather than resort to becoming a cluster of soundbite cliches. </p> <p>Morricone long ago made the decision that he would remain rooted in Rome, where he was born in 1928. More decisive still has been his courteous but firm determination not to speak English, a considerable (and impressively perverse) accomplishment, considering he has worked for so long in an American-dominated industry. So, however often he may have collaborated with Brian de Palma, Mike Nichols or Warren Beatty, he has made sure he has done so from a European perspective. </p> <p>\"I was offered a free villa in Hollywood, but I said no thank you, I prefer to live in Italy,\" he reveals. \"You can see my decision as either a distinctive factor or as a limitation. I don't feel it is a limitation.\" Apart from anything else, he would find it hard to live in a town where movie composers routinely farm out their compositions to batteries of professional arrangers. To Morricone, this is an outrageous abdication of professional responsibility. \"I invented the formula of 'music composed, arranged and conducted by Ennio Morricone',\" he stresses. \"Bernard Herrmann used to write all his scores by himself. So did Bach, Beethoven and Stravinsky. I don't understand why this happens in the movie industry.\" </p> <p>It was his work on the \"spaghetti westerns\" of Sergio Leone during the 1960s that turned Morricone into a household name almost on a par with Leone's stone-faced star, Clint Eastwood. The composer's daring juxtapositions of sounds, from surreal whistling noises to spine-rattling electric guitars and ghostly soprano voices, became an inseparable part of Leone's fevered re-imagining of the western genre. Morricone also seized upon real-life sounds and loaded them with ominous meaning, like the coyote-howl motif from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and the deafening tick of the pocket-watches counting down the climactic shoot-out of For A Few Dollars More. He didn't conceive his scores as something to play over the pictures but as growing organically from the fabric of the movie. </p> <p>\"I come from a background of experimental music which mingled real sounds together with musical sounds,\" he explains, \"so I used real sounds partly to give a kind of nostalgia that the film had to convey. I also used these realistic sounds in a psychological way. With The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I used animal sounds - as you say, the coyote sound - so the sound of the animal became the main theme of the movie. I don't know how I had this idea. It's just according to your experiences, and following the musical avant-garde.\" </p> <p>A childhood aptitude for music earned Morricone a place at Rome's Santa Cecilia Conservatory when he was 12. With some musical theory duly drummed into him, he found himself working as a trumpeter, frequently playing on recording sessions for film scores. \"Most of these scores were very ugly, and I believed I could do better than this. After the war, the film industry was quite strong here in Italy, and the New Realism in Italian cinema was really wonderful, but these new realistic movies didn't have great music. I needed money and I thought it would be a good thing to write film scores, but I never asked anybody in the film industry for work. I thought, 'A film-maker must call me because he thinks what I write is fine.' So it happened that a director called me, then again, and then again, and again. At last people realised that I was good and my career was rising. That's what happened, and now they keep on calling me.\" </p> <p>Although he had first met Sergio Leone when they were both eight and attending the same school, it wasn't until 25 years later that their professional partnership began. In the meantime, Morricone had cut his professional teeth by scoring a string of Italian films, pulling together his tastes for jazz and popular music with a solid grounding in the intellectual rigours of the avant-garde. Quiz him on his musical roots and he tips his hat to some of the most uncompromising figures of 20th-century music, including Boulez, Stockhausen, Luciano Berio and Luigi Nono. Not that he has set out to terrify his listeners with atonal atrocities. It's more a matter of absorption and evolution. </p> <p>\"From my faith in experimental and avant-garde music, I have consolidated this into a different way of composing which takes account of what has happened in music in the last 50 years, and which can communicate something to the audience,\" he suggests. \"This is a normal process. People who are in a revolution and constantly changing go back to normality after that, so things change, then they calm down and become normal again.\" </p> <p>Morricone's success with Leone's films meant that he risked becoming known as a specialist composer who scored cowboy movies. \"This was a serious mistake,\" he points out, \"because I have scored 400 films and only 30 of them are westerns. If you scroll through all the movies I've worked on, you can understand how I was a specialist in westerns, love stories, political movies, action thrillers, horror movies and so on. So in other words, I'm no specialist, because I've done everything. I'm a specialist in music.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, a film composer must be able to conceive strong musical ideas for a score while remaining receptive to the director's wishes. The potential for conflict is clear. \"I have to see a definitive cut of the film before I even start thinking about the music, let alone writing it,\" asserts the maestro. \"After seeing the movie I tell the director what my feelings are and what I would like to do. He accepts what I say, or discusses it, or destroys it. Eventually we have to find a compromise. If the director has no musical creativity, he always imagines something he has already heard, so I have to convince him to leave his ideas aside. I have to trust a director and he has to trust the composer. You have to like each other, otherwise it won't work.\" </p> <p>You'd hardly expect it to click perfectly every time, and it doesn't. In 1975, Pier Paolo Pasolini recruited Morricone to work on arrangements for the soundtrack to the notoriously obscene Salo (120 Days of Sodom). Morricone didn't like the music he was given to work with, and Pasolini didn't want to show him the whole film, apparently because he feared Morricone would be horrified and walk off the project. \"I eventually saw the movie in a theatre and I didn't like it,\" the maestro reports, firmly. \"It wasn't to my taste.\" </p> <p>Morricone has had much happier experiences with Brian de Palma, a director he likes and respects. His percussive, staccato score for The Untouchables earned an Oscar nomination in 1987, but even so, the project wasn't without its moments of anguish. \"De Palma is delicious!\" Morricone says. \"He respects music, he respects composers. For The Untouchables, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, and of course we didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write - a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. And guess what he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie.\" </p> <p>Morricone has grown skilled at fulfilling the professional requirements of his trade, but some projects are naturally closer to his heart than others. His music for Gillo Pontecorvo's classic exposition of revolutionary struggle, the Battle of Algiers, seemed especially personal, and the music accompanying the freedom- fighters has echoes of Bach's Passions. \"It was a movie about freedom of people when Algeria was under French power. France recognised it too, because they abandoned Algeria after that. It was good to be at the director's side and to feel sympathetic for what was right. With another score I composed, Novocento, for Bernardo Bertolucci, a theme from this became a national hymn for Spanish socialists. Films don't really have a political effect, but people understood the message of the music.\" </p> <p>But since scoring films must always be a collaborative venture, it is in his non-cinematic work that Morricone has been able to work out more abstract musical ideas. At his Barbican concerts in March (his first-ever concert performances in Britain) he will conduct a pair of concert works alongside a selection of his scores. Fragment of Eros features soprano, piano and orchestra, while Ombra Di Lontana Presenza uses viola, recorder and strings. </p> <p>\"It's chamber music, but it's not really all that strange,\" he promises. \"I want people to know about all the kinds of music that I write. Some believe I just write film scores, which is not true. With a film score, it is really for the film-makers and the audience. This other music is what the composer feels, and it's more personal.\" </p> <p>Considering his age and his track record, you'd imagine Morricone might fancy putting his feet up. \"You go back to what Bach composed and how much Mozart wrote in 33 years, and you see I am unemployed compared to this,\" he chortles. \"I would like to relax a bit, but this is not the right year to do it.\" </p> <p>Ennio Morricone with the Rome Symphony Orchestra is at the Barbican Hall (box office: 020-7638 8891) on March 10 and 11.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the many extraordinary achievements in Ennio Morricone's career, two in particular stand out. Firstly, he has composed the scores of more than 400 films, including several of the best-known ever written. Secondly, he has never won an Oscar. Maybe that will change this year, with Morricone's nomination for his score for Malena. But, since he's up against the likes of Gladiator and The Patriot, he isn't holding his breath. Quite how the Academy has managed to overlook a man who has been one of the defining influences on film music for the past 40 years must remain as bewildering as its determination to equip Tom Hanks with a shooting gallery of statuettes; but Morricone wasn't the only one who felt that his luck must surely be in on Oscar night 1986, when his score for The Mission was nominated. \"I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission,\" he declares, holding court in the classical splendour of his spacious Rome apartment. \"Especially when you consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft! But, of course, if it was up to me, every two years I would win an Oscar.\" Settling back on his sofa in a woollen sports shirt, tortoiseshell glasses and slip-on loafers, Morricone appears to be a fragile 72-year-old; but since he's capable of launching into passionate outbursts, during which he semaphores with his arms while bouncing enthusiastically up and down, this may be an elaborate disguise. The maestro's tone is ironic, and I'm having his conversation translated to me from Italian, so it's difficult to gauge the precise extent of the outrage he feels towards the cloth-eared Californians. Maybe if he'd been content to keep running variations on A Fistful of Dollars, or his agonisingly beautiful score for Once Upon a Time in the West, there would now be a row of Oscars on his mantelpiece instead of the tasteful array of blue-and-white ceramic vessels. But he has prided himself on evolving his music over the decades, and would die of shame rather than resort to becoming a cluster of soundbite cliches. Morricone long ago made the decision that he would remain rooted in Rome, where he was born in 1928. More decisive still has been his courteous but firm determination not to speak English, a considerable (and impressively perverse) accomplishment, considering he has worked for so long in an American-dominated industry. So, however often he may have collaborated with Brian de Palma, Mike Nichols or Warren Beatty, he has made sure he has done so from a European perspective. \"I was offered a free villa in Hollywood, but I said no thank you, I prefer to live in Italy,\" he reveals. \"You can see my decision as either a distinctive factor or as a limitation. I don't feel it is a limitation.\" Apart from anything else, he would find it hard to live in a town where movie composers routinely farm out their compositions to batteries of professional arrangers. To Morricone, this is an outrageous abdication of professional responsibility. \"I invented the formula of 'music composed, arranged and conducted by Ennio Morricone',\" he stresses. \"Bernard Herrmann used to write all his scores by himself. So did Bach, Beethoven and Stravinsky. I don't understand why this happens in the movie industry.\" It was his work on the \"spaghetti westerns\" of Sergio Leone during the 1960s that turned Morricone into a household name almost on a par with Leone's stone-faced star, Clint Eastwood. The composer's daring juxtapositions of sounds, from surreal whistling noises to spine-rattling electric guitars and ghostly soprano voices, became an inseparable part of Leone's fevered re-imagining of the western genre. Morricone also seized upon real-life sounds and loaded them with ominous meaning, like the coyote-howl motif from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and the deafening tick of the pocket-watches counting down the climactic shoot-out of For A Few Dollars More. He didn't conceive his scores as something to play over the pictures but as growing organically from the fabric of the movie. \"I come from a background of experimental music which mingled real sounds together with musical sounds,\" he explains, \"so I used real sounds partly to give a kind of nostalgia that the film had to convey. I also used these realistic sounds in a psychological way. With The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, I used animal sounds - as you say, the coyote sound - so the sound of the animal became the main theme of the movie. I don't know how I had this idea. It's just according to your experiences, and following the musical avant-garde.\" A childhood aptitude for music earned Morricone a place at Rome's Santa Cecilia Conservatory when he was 12. With some musical theory duly drummed into him, he found himself working as a trumpeter, frequently playing on recording sessions for film scores. \"Most of these scores were very ugly, and I believed I could do better than this. After the war, the film industry was quite strong here in Italy, and the New Realism in Italian cinema was really wonderful, but these new realistic movies didn't have great music. I needed money and I thought it would be a good thing to write film scores, but I never asked anybody in the film industry for work. I thought, 'A film-maker must call me because he thinks what I write is fine.' So it happened that a director called me, then again, and then again, and again. At last people realised that I was good and my career was rising. That's what happened, and now they keep on calling me.\" Although he had first met Sergio Leone when they were both eight and attending the same school, it wasn't until 25 years later that their professional partnership began. In the meantime, Morricone had cut his professional teeth by scoring a string of Italian films, pulling together his tastes for jazz and popular music with a solid grounding in the intellectual rigours of the avant-garde. Quiz him on his musical roots and he tips his hat to some of the most uncompromising figures of 20th-century music, including Boulez, Stockhausen, Luciano Berio and Luigi Nono. Not that he has set out to terrify his listeners with atonal atrocities. It's more a matter of absorption and evolution. \"From my faith in experimental and avant-garde music, I have consolidated this into a different way of composing which takes account of what has happened in music in the last 50 years, and which can communicate something to the audience,\" he suggests. \"This is a normal process. People who are in a revolution and constantly changing go back to normality after that, so things change, then they calm down and become normal again.\" Morricone's success with Leone's films meant that he risked becoming known as a specialist composer who scored cowboy movies. \"This was a serious mistake,\" he points out, \"because I have scored 400 films and only 30 of them are westerns. If you scroll through all the movies I've worked on, you can understand how I was a specialist in westerns, love stories, political movies, action thrillers, horror movies and so on. So in other words, I'm no specialist, because I've done everything. I'm a specialist in music.\" Paradoxically, a film composer must be able to conceive strong musical ideas for a score while remaining receptive to the director's wishes. The potential for conflict is clear. \"I have to see a definitive cut of the film before I even start thinking about the music, let alone writing it,\" asserts the maestro. \"After seeing the movie I tell the director what my feelings are and what I would like to do. He accepts what I say, or discusses it, or destroys it. Eventually we have to find a compromise. If the director has no musical creativity, he always imagines something he has already heard, so I have to convince him to leave his ideas aside. I have to trust a director and he has to trust the composer. You have to like each other, otherwise it won't work.\" You'd hardly expect it to click perfectly every time, and it doesn't.

      "body": "<p>As I sit in a Manchester hotel bar a young man walks slowly across the room. He's quite tall and very slim, stooped inside slightly ill-fitting dark clothes that might have been bought at Oxfam, and he wears an expression of distractedsadness. For a stunning moment, I swear that it is Ian Curtis, the Joy Division singer who killed himself 20 years ago. He disappears through a door, vanishes like a ghost. </p> <p>I'm in Manchester to watch the filming of 24 Hour Party People, a story about the Manchester music scene from the punk of 1976 to the post-acid of 1992, a story about the suicide of Ian Curtis, a story about the artful dodging of Shaun Ryder, a story about a city that changed its face inside a decade, a story about the Hacienda nightclub, and most of all, a story about Tony Wilson, hero, villain, intellectual, slimeball, charlatan, loser, eccentric, drama queen, ultimate northern romantic. </p> <p>The film features Human Traffic's John Simm, The Royle Family's Ralf Little, Human Remains's Rob Brydon, Snatch's Lenny James, A Room for Romeo Brass's Paddy Considine, and comedians Peter Kay, Keith Allen, John Thompson, and Dave Gorman. </p> <p>And then there's Steve Coogan as the brilliant, infuriating Tony Wilson, the man who soaks up the sacred Manchester air as if it is a drug that will speed him up and spin him around until he glimpses God, or becomes God, or perhaps just gets to boss God around. Coogan as Wilson! Only in Manchester. It may be a story about art, love, death, ambition, betrayal, vanity, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and more death, but you've got to laugh. </p> <p>John Simm is driving in from Manchester airport to begin work on the film. He is, to his sheer delight, playing Bernard Sumner, the Joy Division/New Order guitarist. Simm's cab driver recognises him. He asks him what he's in town for. Simm tells him he's got a part in 24 Hour Party People. \"What's that?\" asks the cabbie. He will at best know Wilson as the annoying man off the telly, the one with the poncey clothes, not the rock'n'roll games player. You know, Simm explains, it's the story of Factory Records, and the Hacienda, and Tony Wilson. The cab driver cannot believe his ears. \"Hang on,\" he shouts, \"You're telling me they're making a fucking movie about that wanker Tony Wilson, and he's the main part? Oh, he's going to fucking love that, isn't he?\" </p> <p>If you live outside the Granada television area, and can't quite place Tony Wilson, imagine TV's silky, sickly smooth John Stapleton, but as well as smiling on the TV, reading autocues and twinkling from the eye, make believe he also runs Fatboy Slim's label. Or think Richard Madeley of Richard and Judy blended with Archer, Attenborough, Hefner, Branson, Don Quixote and Umberto Eco. </p> <p>Steve Coogan was 10 when he first saw Wilson in the flesh. It was 1975 and Wilson the local TV celebrity was visiting Coogan's house for a birthday party. He seemed so exotic, even though he was just the local equivalent of the weatherman. Coogan worked with Wilson for a while in the late 1980s on a late night Granada show, and got to know him semi-socially. \"And I used to do an impression of him,\" Coogan tells me after a hard day being Wilson. \"Easy day, actually, although I probably shouldn't say that. But Tony Wilson has done all the work for me. I just turn up and put on the wig and clothes, and off I go.\" He does a bit of Wilson for me, and he's as camp and as breathless as the real thing. \"It's that sort of foppish, self-conscious thing he has, it's quite effeminate actually, and you can't work out whether he's being incredibly eloquent or just bullshitting, and it's sort of in the middle.\" </p> <p>\"It's all untrue,\" Wilson bellows down the phone when I call him about the movie. He takes himself very seriously, and laughs at himself constantly. He's all mixed up and dead sure of himself. </p> <p>The film sets him midway between local hero who helped drag Manchester into a bright 21st century and an almost psychedelic figure of fun. \"It's all made up. Which is good! I always quote Howard Hawks - that between legend and truth always choose the legend. Well, that's what's happening with this film. They've gone for the legend. I tried hard to get them to make the film about the two really great stories, Curtis and Ryder, but I gave up when I realised where Coogan was going to go with it. And that's fine. It's his gig. I'm sort of like the Rovers Return in it, you know, everything in Coronation Street revolves around the pub, and that's me. I'm the pub. And they're going to take the piss out of me. They have to. How else can they make it? But I'm at ease with it. You probably think I'm a fucking idiot for letting them do it, but I'm at ease. Flattered, embarrassed and at ease.\" </p> <p>Thirty-nine-year-old director Michael Winterbottom told writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce that he was thinking of making a film about Factory Records. Frank told Winterbottom that if he got anyone else to write it, he would kill him. He's a Liverpudlian, but he appreciated what set Manchester apart: the sheer madness and self-belief that seemed to be passed from the Sex Pistols to an audience of about 50 Mancunians the night they played the Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976. </p> <p>\"At first you think it's the story of Ian Curtis, a rock'n'roll suicide, or that of Shaun Ryder, classic rock'n'roll excess, but actually, it's more than that; there are loads of other stories to tell about Manchester during that time. And the best way to tell them is through Wilson, because somehow he was always at the middle of it all. And if you grew up in the north-west during the 1970s, then Wilson was an absolutely riveting character. Because he read the news, and he did stupid local news stories with ducks and sheep, but he also presented a punk rock programme and had a really hip record label. He was like your uncle, but he was totally rock'n'roll. And all this mad stuff happened because of him, and in spite of him. And whereas artists seem to have a skin missing, entrepreneurs like Wilson seem to have this extra skin. You can never seem to upset Wilson. He knows people think he's a wanker, but it doesn't bother him. I sent him a copy of the script, which is affectionate but also has a go, and I thought he'd send out a hit man to kill me. But he rang me up, and said, love, it's fabulous, do you fancy a drink?\" </p> <p>Coogan, as intensely serious as only an off- duty comedian can be, worries away at who and what Wilson might be, an impossible task, because as soon as you think you've pinned him down, he's changed shape, he's changed his mind. \"It's like he's not sure if he's Melvyn Bragg or Malcolm McLaren, and in a way he's more interesting than either of them, and the fact he's never achieved as much as those two is also interesting. Joy Division could have been U2, Hacienda could have become Cream or the Ministry of Sound, but somehow the wild energy that went into setting everything up caused its collapse, and nothing ever went corporate or boring. It's like Wilson would rather have disaster than obviousness. As long as it causes a reaction.\" </p> <p>The film's producer Andrew Eaton explains how hard it was to raise money for the film; and how hard it was to get all the proud, uncompromising characters involved to agree to their lives being stretched and shredded into this substitute reality. \"It was hard to get backers to appreciate why anyone would be interested in these characters. They didn't think anyone would know who they were. But it doesn't matter whether you know who these characters are or not. It's such a great story. You couldn't make up stuff that was funnier, or sadder. And everyone who we've featured is willing for it to work. Because as funny, or as sad, as it is, it's a celebration of a great movement, and the people who made it happen.\" </p> <p>We're talking in a nightclub in Manchester that's doubling for the working man's club in Hulme that Wilson and co used in 1977 to launch their Factory night. Coogan as Wilson is persuading Peter Kay as the club owner to let them use his venue. I catch my first sight of Coogan camped out in a 1970s Wilson wig, and my mind boggles in sympathy, respect, and the kind of love you can feel around Wilson that sometimes bleeds over into less than love. (When you hate Wilson you think you're being too harsh: when you love him you wonder if you've been conned.) Later on, the opening night of the Factory club will be recreated, with frail ambient guitarist Vinni Reilly and Joy Division. I can't wait. Joy Division are the greatest rock group I have ever seen on stage. I was there at the opening of the Factory club 23 years ago, and I'm here to see what kind of mess, or what kind of strangeness, there will be in trying to mock up such a past. A past that had it's own particular mess and strangeness. </p> <p>When people hear that Coogan is playing Wilson, there's a gasp. But in a way it's not Coogan playing Wilson. It's Alan Partridge. There was always a bit of Wilson, the pedantic, pushy, self-centred Wilson, in Partridge. </p> <p>\"Tony Wilson is like a leftwing, avant-garde Alan Partridge, although Partridge is a much bigger idiot and isn't trying to push the frontiers of anything. And I like Wilson for many of the same reasons I liked Alan Partridge. Wilson is very flawed, but very human, and there is something brave and amateurish about what he does.\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" sweet-talks Wilson, his speech gathering pace as he talks down his mobile phone. I have caught him searching Manchester bookshops for a photograph for a Joy Division album sleeve. I imagine him marching - no, swanning - around the streets of his beloved Manchester as he talks to me. Coat flaring out behind him, him and his shadow larger than real or film life. \"Yes, it's the past and it's fun and it's entertaining.... but it's all over. Who gives a fuck about the past? The film seems very irrelevant to me. I'm interested in now, the future, in moving on . . . I'm about to sign the best rock'n'roll band in the world, I'm setting up an internet company, I'm doing a new Factory with a new name...\" He begins to talk even faster, as if he's running away from a past and a self that this film celebrates, and satirises, and fixes in time, The film may be his monument, until they build a statue in Albert Square. A sad, stupid, lovely tribute that proves he was right all along - he knows what he's talking about - and yet wrong - he didn't have a clue what he was doing. I ask him if he feels the film is sort of like a lifetime award and means that, as far as his adventures are concerned, it's all over bar the nostalgia. \"Absolutely not,\" he snaps heatedly, \"no, no, no...\" There might be a note of panic in his voice, there might not be. Who can ever tell with Wilson ? </p> <p>Keith Allen tells Winterbottom that if he's not in the film, he's going to kill him. </p> <p>Rob Brydon, punked up for the day, hasn't got a clue what's going on. \"I missed the Sex Pistols,\" he admits, \"I was dancing to Shakin' Stevens in 1977. It was all disco and cheesecloth for me.\" He represents all those people who know very little about the rise and farce of Factory Records, who know nothing about the extreme mood music of Joy Division, or the artistic vision of the label, or their belief in the rights of the artists, or their magnificent failure. He doesn't know anything about the Hacienda club, opened as a gift for Manchester people using money made by Joy Division and New Order, because Wilson and his collaborators were committed to giving something back to the city they loved. He knows nothing about the shootings and stabbings that shut the club down. He ended up in the film because he's close to Coogan. </p> <p>He's playing a local journalist, and I am pleased to put on the record that Brydon - known for playing perverts, misfits and nutters, often with a vicious streak - is not playing a character based on me. A writer played by Simon Pegg, from the TV series Spaced, is reluctantly dragged by Wilson to see the dead body of Ian Curtis lying in his coffin, and somewhere in that scene is a small part of my messy, strange past turned into film. The script tells it all wrong, yet sort of right, and I suppose the whole film will wrongly translate the near reality of what happened with an underlying rightness that will be as real or unreal as anything. </p> <p>Brydon plays a niggly character always trying, and always failing, to wrong-step Wilson. \"I'm sure there will be people like you saying this is wrong, that's wrong, that wouldn't have happened then. But most people like me aren't an expert on any of this. For me, it's just a great story, like some twisted love letter to Tony Wilson, and I saw the recreation of the Sex Pistols concert the other day, and they looked great to me. They were the Sex Pistols as far as I was concerned. I don't know any better, like most people. The thing about these kind of biopics, they can be terrible, but in the end it's not about the period detail, it's about getting the spirit across.\" </p> <p>I tell him that the Sex Pistols T-shirt he's wearing at a 1978 concert wouldn't have actually appeared in Manchester for about another seven and a half months. He gives me a right Welsh look that shrivels me to Manchester drizzle, and I shut up. \"I hate these fucking punk clothes... what is the point of wearing clothes that make you look less attractive?\" </p> <p>He all but gobs on me. </p> <p>Just to piss people off, the man known as Tony Wilson to a generation or three of north-west people changed his name. He became Anthony Wilson. And then, to wind people up even more, Anthony H Wilson. \"I never liked Tony. I was always Anthony to my mum, at university. I just wanted to be Anthony again.\" </p> <p>Anthony H Wilson is entering his office in Manchester when he sees a terrible sight. He sees himself 23 years ago. \"There I was,\" laughs Coogan, \"in full Wilson make up, in the long coat, with the scarf he always wears, and there he was, the 2001 version, with the 2001 version of the coat, and the scarf.\" Wilson took one look at Coogan, and scampered.... Coogan shouted after him: \"It's 1977 again, Tony!\" You feel that if they had touched, like the Patrick Troughton Dr Who touching the Tom Baker Dr Who, the universe would have imploded. Right now there are two Wilsons with all the ego and appetite that involves time travelling across the city of their dreams. Scary. </p> <p>Mostly, Wilson tries to stay away from wherever they're filming. Worried, perhaps, that it will be too inaccurate. Or too accurate. </p> <p>I interview Joy Division for the first time in 20 years. I once thought by the time I interviewed Joy Division for the Guardian in 2001 they would be bigger than Led Zeppelin. Instead, because of an enforced change in style and pace, they became New Order, and changed music history on the loud quiet, influencing the 1980s change from punk to rave. </p> <p>Sean Harris has perhaps the most difficult job of all the actors in the film. He's playing Ian Curtis, representing physically and mentally the sharp tragedy that is at the heart of this broad comedy. I interview the film's Joy Division. They're like a tribute band: Joyless Division. Ralf Little - born in 1980, the year Curtis died - is freaked how little he resembles the man he's playing, Peter Hook. I bet he wishes they were still as faceless back in the days they hid behind the bleakly glamorous Peter Saville art work. </p> <p>Little races around the set in a state of extreme panic. \"Paddy's great at Rob, John's got Barney, you should see Martin Hannett, but me - I have no fucking idea what I'm doing.\" John Simm seems as compact, wiped out and wry as his target, Barney. The film's Hooky and Barney banter like the real-life couple and tell me that Harris is extraordinary as Curtis. He's apparently unbelievable at doing the possessed Curtis dance, where the quietest of men would suddenly explode into compressed derangement. Shyness transported into a kind of flight. I can't wait to see it. </p> <p>Harris slumps next to me in an exhausted Ian Curtis pose he's copied from a particularly dramatic Anton Corbijn photograph. The resemblance to Curtis seems to be on the right side of right and wrong. He appears to be in character, although the character of the tortured artist Ian actually wasn't, at least not in public. He mumbles: \"I feel very obligated to doing this well...there's a lot of pressure...I met his daughter the other day. She's an extra on the film. She's about 20 now. She came up to me and said, 'You're playing my dad.' I just apologised. It was the first thing that came into my head. She just stared at me. I just stared at her. What can I do? I ain't going to get it right. I'll get it as right as I can.\" </p> <p>I can't shut Wilson up. Who can? \"I had a drink with the two actors playing two of my best friends who are now dead, Rob Gretton and Martin Hannett, and that was shocking. They're so much like them. Very, very disturbing. I was extraordinarily moved and confused.\" </p> <p>Characters from real-life Manchester played by actors in film-life Manchester get a chance to appear in small roles. Wilson himself will appear in the film as a Granada TV studio director. Shaun Ryder plays his own father. Howard Devoto, the man who could be said to have started it all by arranging for the Sex Pistols to play at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, appears in the film as a toilet cleaner. There is so much and so little that can be read into that. </p> <p>While I wait for the film Joy Division to mime to the real Joy Division, Howard is filming his cameo. He's blissfully unaware that the actor playing him, Martin Hancock, is best known for the role of Spider in Coronation Street. Howard doesn't watch Coronation Street. </p> <p>Howard's cameo finds a way for today's Devoto to question whether an episode attributed to yesterday's Devoto - sex in the Factory club toilets with Wilson's wife Lindsey - actually happened. The thing about this film is that everyone involved in the Manchester past being trapped and caricatured remembers things differently, and the film is just another version. Sometimes it changes things to how perhaps they should have been rather than how they were. \"Martin pogos when he's performing as me. I never pogoed. Perhaps I should have done.\" Devoto adds his own detail, wearing bright yellow rubber gloves with the words love and hate written across them. Now that is very wrong, and yet, somehow, quite right. </p> <p>Hancock cannot believe that he is playing Devoto. He unpeels a huge Spidery grin. \"We were both just smirking at each other. I was smirking because I was working on the Howard Devoto smirk and he was smirking because he could see that I was working on the Howard Devoto smirk. We just had a massive smirk at each other.\" </p> <p>In the end, I never get to see the four actors play at being Joy Division. Time runs out. I do see a pretty right Vinni Reilly play delicate electric guitar as a sound rippling from the gods to the gutter, and note Sean Harris doing what Ian Curtis used to do, sit at the front of the stage and let the loveliness of Vinni's music rinse away whatever ugliness or sadness Ian felt was darkening his world. He sits exactly like Ian used to sit, and amongst a lot of cartoon spooky things that had happened during my day on set, revisiting a past as rightly and wrongly far-fetched as this recreation, this sight is the most authentically eerie. </p> <p>I decide it's a good thing that I don't see Sean try to capture Ian's incandescent dance. It's absolutely vital to the making of the film that Sean doesn't look like a twit performing as Curtis, and not important at all. Coogan's three Wilson wigs will make the thing look like Confession of a Pop Svengali and ruin everything, or just add to the general anarchic gaiety. </p> <p>In the directing distance, way out of my set-visiting range, Michael Winterbottom, with the deep trust of his excellent cast, juggles a real Manchester and an unreal Manchester, a real art versus commerce battle, and an unreal one. He's making it all up as he goes along in true Factory spirit, basing everything on a vague plan wrapped around an impossible dream. I'm told the original idea was a Mancunian Boogie Nights, and now the aim is a sort of rock'n'roll Natural Born Killers. It's up to Winterbottom to make sure that the film is more more Oliver Stone than Carry On, or at least a kind of Stoned Carry On. \"The worst thing that this film can be,\" says Coogan, \"is dull.\" </p> <p>It is a chance to tell a modern story about modern Britain in a modern way, something that is absurdly rare. </p> <p>Anthony H Wilson leaves a message on my answer machine. He's been fretting at the idea that the film will signify the end of his journey. He's keen to explain that, as always, he's actually only just beginning. \"There's the things I'm doing now that just make the movie irrelevant to me... big development projects in Liverpool, lots of things in Manchester to do with moving the city on... I just want to get it over that just because they make a movie about your life, it doesn't mean that it's all over. Life does go on. OK, God bless, bye, love.\" </p> <p>On the way to the station the next morning a solitary figure in grey passes right by me, a million miles away. He's apparently concentrating on something beyond comprehension. For a moment I swear it's Ian Curtis. Walking once more the streets of the city Wilson built, a city that made and destroyed him.

      "bodyText": "As I sit in a Manchester hotel bar a young man walks slowly across the room. He's quite tall and very slim, stooped inside slightly ill-fitting dark clothes that might have been bought at Oxfam, and he wears an expression of distractedsadness. For a stunning moment, I swear that it is Ian Curtis, the Joy Division singer who killed himself 20 years ago. He disappears through a door, vanishes like a ghost. I'm in Manchester to watch the filming of 24 Hour Party People, a story about the Manchester music scene from the punk of 1976 to the post-acid of 1992, a story about the suicide of Ian Curtis, a story about the artful dodging of Shaun Ryder, a story about a city that changed its face inside a decade, a story about the Hacienda nightclub, and most of all, a story about Tony Wilson, hero, villain, intellectual, slimeball, charlatan, loser, eccentric, drama queen, ultimate northern romantic. The film features Human Traffic's John Simm, The Royle Family's Ralf Little, Human Remains's Rob Brydon, Snatch's Lenny James, A Room for Romeo Brass's Paddy Considine, and comedians Peter Kay, Keith Allen, John Thompson, and Dave Gorman. And then there's Steve Coogan as the brilliant, infuriating Tony Wilson, the man who soaks up the sacred Manchester air as if it is a drug that will speed him up and spin him around until he glimpses God, or becomes God, or perhaps just gets to boss God around. Coogan as Wilson! Only in Manchester. It may be a story about art, love, death, ambition, betrayal, vanity, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and more death, but you've got to laugh. John Simm is driving in from Manchester airport to begin work on the film. He is, to his sheer delight, playing Bernard Sumner, the Joy Division/New Order guitarist. Simm's cab driver recognises him. He asks him what he's in town for. Simm tells him he's got a part in 24 Hour Party People. \"What's that?\" asks the cabbie. He will at best know Wilson as the annoying man off the telly, the one with the poncey clothes, not the rock'n'roll games player. You know, Simm explains, it's the story of Factory Records, and the Hacienda, and Tony Wilson. The cab driver cannot believe his ears. \"Hang on,\" he shouts, \"You're telling me they're making a fucking movie about that wanker Tony Wilson, and he's the main part? Oh, he's going to fucking love that, isn't he?\" If you live outside the Granada television area, and can't quite place Tony Wilson, imagine TV's silky, sickly smooth John Stapleton, but as well as smiling on the TV, reading autocues and twinkling from the eye, make believe he also runs Fatboy Slim's label. Or think Richard Madeley of Richard and Judy blended with Archer, Attenborough, Hefner, Branson, Don Quixote and Umberto Eco. Steve Coogan was 10 when he first saw Wilson in the flesh. It was 1975 and Wilson the local TV celebrity was visiting Coogan's house for a birthday party. He seemed so exotic, even though he was just the local equivalent of the weatherman. Coogan worked with Wilson for a while in the late 1980s on a late night Granada show, and got to know him semi-socially. \"And I used to do an impression of him,\" Coogan tells me after a hard day being Wilson. \"Easy day, actually, although I probably shouldn't say that. But Tony Wilson has done all the work for me. I just turn up and put on the wig and clothes, and off I go.\" He does a bit of Wilson for me, and he's as camp and as breathless as the real thing. \"It's that sort of foppish, self-conscious thing he has, it's quite effeminate actually, and you can't work out whether he's being incredibly eloquent or just bullshitting, and it's sort of in the middle.\" \"It's all untrue,\" Wilson bellows down the phone when I call him about the movie. He takes himself very seriously, and laughs at himself constantly. He's all mixed up and dead sure of himself. The film sets him midway between local hero who helped drag Manchester into a bright 21st century and an almost psychedelic figure of fun. \"It's all made up. Which is good! I always quote Howard Hawks - that between legend and truth always choose the legend. Well, that's what's happening with this film. They've gone for the legend. I tried hard to get them to make the film about the two really great stories, Curtis and Ryder, but I gave up when I realised where Coogan was going to go with it. And that's fine. It's his gig. I'm sort of like the Rovers Return in it, you know, everything in Coronation Street revolves around the pub, and that's me. I'm the pub. And they're going to take the piss out of me. They have to. How else can they make it? But I'm at ease with it. You probably think I'm a fucking idiot for letting them do it, but I'm at ease. Flattered, embarrassed and at ease.\" Thirty-nine-year-old director Michael Winterbottom told writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce that he was thinking of making a film about Factory Records. Frank told Winterbottom that if he got anyone else to write it, he would kill him. He's a Liverpudlian, but he appreciated what set Manchester apart: the sheer madness and self-belief that seemed to be passed from the Sex Pistols to an audience of about 50 Mancunians the night they played the Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976. \"At first you think it's the story of Ian Curtis, a rock'n'roll suicide, or that of Shaun Ryder, classic rock'n'roll excess, but actually, it's more than that; there are loads of other stories to tell about Manchester during that time. And the best way to tell them is through Wilson, because somehow he was always at the middle of it all. And if you grew up in the north-west during the 1970s, then Wilson was an absolutely riveting character. Because he read the news, and he did stupid local news stories with ducks and sheep, but he also presented a punk rock programme and had a really hip record label. He was like your uncle, but he was totally rock'n'roll. And all this mad stuff happened because of him, and in spite of him. And whereas artists seem to have a skin missing, entrepreneurs like Wilson seem to have this extra skin. You can never seem to upset Wilson. He knows people think he's a wanker, but it doesn't bother him. I sent him a copy of the script, which is affectionate but also has a go, and I thought he'd send out a hit man to kill me. But he rang me up, and said, love, it's fabulous, do you fancy a drink?\" Coogan, as intensely serious as only an off- duty comedian can be, worries away at who and what Wilson might be, an impossible task, because as soon as you think you've pinned him down, he's changed shape, he's changed his mind. \"It's like he's not sure if he's Melvyn Bragg or Malcolm McLaren, and in a way he's more interesting than either of them, and the fact he's never achieved as much as those two is also interesting. Joy Division could have been U2, Hacienda could have become Cream or the Ministry of Sound, but somehow the wild energy that went into setting everything up caused its collapse, and nothing ever went corporate or boring. It's like Wilson would rather have disaster than obviousness. As long as it causes a reaction.\" The film's producer Andrew Eaton explains how hard it was to raise money for the film; and how hard it was to get all the proud, uncompromising characters involved to agree to their lives being stretched and shredded into this substitute reality. \"It was hard to get backers to appreciate why anyone would be interested in these characters. They didn't think anyone would know who they were. But it doesn't matter whether you know who these characters are or not. It's such a great story. You couldn't make up stuff that was funnier, or sadder. And everyone who we've featured is willing for it to work. Because as funny, or as sad, as it is, it's a celebration of a great movement, and the people who made it happen.\" We're talking in a nightclub in Manchester that's doubling for the working man's club in Hulme that Wilson and co used in 1977 to launch their Factory night. Coogan as Wilson is persuading Peter Kay as the club owner to let them use his venue. I catch my first sight of Coogan camped out in a 1970s Wilson wig, and my mind boggles in sympathy, respect, and the kind of love you can feel around Wilson that sometimes bleeds over into less than love. (When you hate Wilson you think you're being too harsh: when you love him you wonder if you've been conned.) Later on, the opening night of the Factory club will be recreated, with frail ambient guitarist Vinni Reilly and Joy Division. I can't wait. Joy Division are the greatest rock group I have ever seen on stage. I was there at the opening of the Factory club 23 years ago, and I'm here to see what kind of mess, or what kind of strangeness, there will be in trying to mock up such a past. A past that had it's own particular mess and strangeness. When people hear that Coogan is playing Wilson, there's a gasp. But in a way it's not Coogan playing Wilson. It's Alan Partridge. There was always a bit of Wilson, the pedantic, pushy, self-centred Wilson, in Partridge. \"Tony Wilson is like a leftwing, avant-garde Alan Partridge, although Partridge is a much bigger idiot and isn't trying to push the frontiers of anything. And I like Wilson for many of the same reasons I liked Alan Partridge. Wilson is very flawed, but very human, and there is something brave and amateurish about what he does.\" \"Yes,\" sweet-talks Wilson, his speech gathering pace as he talks down his mobile phone. I have caught him searching Manchester bookshops for a photograph for a Joy Division album sleeve. I imagine him marching - no, swanning - around the streets of his beloved Manchester as he talks to me. Coat flaring out behind him, him and his shadow larger than real or film life. \"Yes, it's the past and it's fun and it's entertaining.... but it's all over. Who gives a fuck about the past? The film seems very irrelevant to me. I'm interested in now, the future, in moving on . . . I'm about to sign the best rock'n'roll band in the world, I'm setting up an internet company, I'm doing a new Factory with a new name...\" He begins to talk even faster, as if he's running away from a past and a self that this film celebrates, and satirises, and fixes in time, The film may be his monument, until they build a statue in Albert Square. A sad, stupid, lovely tribute that proves he was right all along - he knows what he's talking about - and yet wrong - he didn't have a clue what he was doing. I ask him if he feels the film is sort of like a lifetime award and means that, as far as his adventures are concerned, it's all over bar the nostalgia. \"Absolutely not,\" he snaps heatedly, \"no, no, no...\" There might be a note of panic in his voice, there might not be. Who can ever tell with Wilson ? Keith Allen tells Winterbottom that if he's not in the film, he's going to kill him. Rob Brydon, punked up for the day, hasn't got a clue what's going on. \"I missed the Sex Pistols,\" he admits, \"I was dancing to Shakin' Stevens in 1977. It was all disco and cheesecloth for me.\" He represents all those people who know very little about the rise and farce of Factory Records, who know nothing about the extreme mood music of Joy Division, or the artistic vision of the label, or their belief in the rights of the artists, or their magnificent failure. He doesn't know anything about the Hacienda club, opened as a gift for Manchester people using money made by Joy Division and New Order, because Wilson and his collaborators were committed to giving something back to the city they loved. He knows nothing about the shootings and stabbings that shut the club down. He ended up in the film because he's close to Coogan. He's playing a local journalist, and I am pleased to put on the record that Brydon - known for playing perverts, misfits and nutters, often with a vicious streak - is not playing a character based on me. A writer played by Simon Pegg, from the TV series Spaced, is reluctantly dragged by Wilson to see the dead body of Ian Curtis lying in his coffin, and somewhere in that scene is a small part of my messy, strange past turned into film. The script tells it all wrong, yet sort of right, and I suppose the whole film will wrongly translate the near reality of what happened with an underlying rightness that will be as real or unreal as anything. Brydon plays a niggly character always trying, and always failing, to wrong-step Wilson. \"I'm sure there will be people like you saying this is wrong, that's wrong, that wouldn't have happened then. But most people like me aren't an expert on any of this. For me, it's just a great story, like some twisted love letter to Tony Wilson, and I saw the recreation of the Sex Pistols concert the other day, and they looked great to me. They were the Sex Pistols as far as I was concerned. I don't know any better, like most people. The thing about these kind of biopics, they can be terrible, but in the end it's not about the period detail, it's about getting the spirit across.\" I tell him that the Sex Pistols T-shirt he's wearing at a 1978 concert wouldn't have actually appeared in Manchester for about another seven and a half months. He gives me a right Welsh look that shrivels me to Manchester drizzle, and I shut up. \"I hate these fucking punk clothes... what is the point of wearing clothes that make you look less attractive?\" He all but gobs on me. Just to piss people off, the man known as Tony Wilson to a generation or three of north-west people changed his name. He became Anthony Wilson. And then, to wind people up even more, Anthony H Wilson. \"I never liked Tony. I was always Anthony to my mum, at university. I just wanted to be Anthony again.\" Anthony H Wilson is entering his office in Manchester when he sees a terrible sight. He sees himself 23 years ago. \"There I was,\" laughs Coogan, \"in full Wilson make up, in the long coat, with the scarf he always wears, and there he was, the 2001 version, with the 2001 version of the coat, and the scarf.\" Wilson took one look at Coogan, and scampered.... Coogan shouted after him: \"It's 1977 again, Tony!\" You feel that if they had touched, like the Patrick Troughton Dr Who touching the Tom Baker Dr Who, the universe would have imploded. Right now there are two Wilsons with all the ego and appetite that involves time travelling across the city of their dreams. Scary. Mostly, Wilson tries to stay away from wherever they're filming. Worried, perhaps, that it will be too inaccurate. Or too accurate. I interview Joy Division for the first time in 20 years. I once thought by the time I interviewed Joy Division for the Guardian in 2001 they would be bigger than Led Zeppelin. Instead, because of an enforced change in style and pace, they became New Order, and changed music history on the loud quiet, influencing the 1980s change from punk to rave.

Little races around the set in a state of extreme panic. \"Paddy's great at Rob, John's got Barney, you should see Martin Hannett, but me - I have no fucking idea what I'm doing.\" John Simm seems as compact, wiped out and wry as his target, Barney. The film's Hooky and Barney banter like the real-life couple and tell me that Harris is extraordinary as Curtis. He's apparently unbelievable at doing the possessed Curtis dance, where the quietest of men would suddenly explode into compressed derangement. Shyness transported into a kind of flight. I can't wait to see it. Harris slumps next to me in an exhausted Ian Curtis pose he's copied from a particularly dramatic Anton Corbijn photograph.

Wilson himself will appear in the film as a Granada TV studio director. Shaun Ryder plays his own father. Howard Devoto, the man who could be said to have started it all by arranging for the Sex Pistols to play at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, appears in the film as a toilet cleaner. There is so much and so little that can be read into that. While I wait for the film Joy Division to mime to the real Joy Division, Howard is filming his cameo.

Absurd statements that are true, or are possibly true, are always delicious - in a Freudian way, one suspects - and can be quite tickly. Simple paradoxes are the best kind, my personal favourite being \"I always tell lies.\" More complex ones can lead to nose bleeds. Thinking too much about Bertrand Russell's paradox, for example, can cause your brain to drip out of your nose. Along with fur-trimmed anythings (other than live animals, of course), this isn't a good look, despite what you might hear at London Fashion Week. </p> <p>If you haven't heard of Russell's paradox - and if you have a life, why would you? - it arises within naive set theory by considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. Such a set appears to be a member of itself if, and only if, it is not a member of itself. Some sets, such as the set of all teacups, are not members of themselves. Other sets, such as the set of all non-teacups, are members of themselves. Call the set of all sets that are not members of themselves S. If S is a member of itself, then by definition it must not be a member of itself. Similarly, if S is not a member of itself, then by definition it must be a member of itself. Clear? Good. </p> <p>Like I said, my favourite is \"I always tell lies.\" </p> <p>I mean it. </p> <p>Anyway, it was the paradox of the runaway freeze, and whether the rather eccentric group of scientists could square that particular circle, which kept <strong> Horizon</strong> (BBC2) so watchable. The boffins - one beardy, one squeakily voiced, one big and burly - were trying to prove that 600 million years ago, the whole world was covered in ice, even the tropics. Orthodox wisdom, as is its wont, scoffed at such a claim. If the whole world was covered in ice, it would have been so cold that it could never have thawed. Everything would be dead and we wouldn't be here. There was a far simpler solution: aliens. No, not really. The simpler solution was continental drift. The rocks must have been deposited in Namibia before Namibia was where it is today. </p> <p>Continents, you may be interested to know, move at the same speed as your fingernails grow. It takes 400 million years for the continents to move from the polar regions to the tropics. I think this means that if you let your fingernails grow for 400 million years, they 'd stretch from the equator to the South Pole. Handy if you wanted to scratch a penguin from really far away. </p> <p>But I digress. Beardy, Squeaky and Burly had magnetic rocks with which to refute the simple solution. The magnetism of these dropstones proved that they hadn't left Namibia where it is today, so the country had once been frozen. But - and there's always a but when Horizon seems all sewn up after 20 minutes - orthodoxy wasn't prepared to lie down and surrender. So the challenge for Beardy, Squeaky and Burly was then to solve the paradox of the Runaway Freeze by rewriting the rules of conventional science. This involved imagining what could have warmed up the snowball earth (no, not aliens, but a build-up of carbon dioxide from erupting volcanoes), musing on how tremendously violent weather, including acid rain, lasted over a century and blew away the carbon dioxide, and explaining how life had managed to survive on snowball earth throughout (the ice was very transparent and had allowed bacteria in the sea under it to photosynthesise). </p> <p>Watching Beardy and chums weave their windy, windy story thus far was jolly enough, but the ironic coup de grce came when it was revealed that snowball earth and its defrosting led to the big evolutionary burst of which we are the end result. Hard to believe when watching <strong> Trisha</strong> (ITV), but true nonetheless. (\"You're An Embarrassment\" was the title of yesterday's programme, which saw men dressed up as Ali G and a Twiglet.) </p> <p>But just when you think, \"What an intelligent, unmelodramatic, quality Horizon that was\", they go and spoil it by coming over all Armageddon. Ominously warning that since no one knows why or how ice ages come about, it could happen again and everything would die. \"Including us.\" Well, technically, that's true but, as the programme itself admits, not for millions of years.

I have switched to a worthwhile and interesting job, have paid off the debts and sorted out the legal problems on our jointly owned flat. However, I still feel overwhelmed by depression. I have had counselling, bereavement counselling, psychotherapy, drug therapy, and hypnotherapy. I have taken holidays and have spent money on nice things to do. But on an almost daily basis I think about suicide. I have no interest in my appearance, finding a new partner, sex, making new friends or planning for the future.

Name and address withheld Stop being selfish And they say couples who choose not to have children are selfish! To describe any 15-year-old as \"rebellious\" is like saying grass is green. So now you have a new baby, your 15-year-old is surplus to requirements. If I were him I'd contact social services and ask to be placed with caring foster parents until I was old enough to look after myself. Let's hope his experience of \"family\" life will not have put him off forming relationships in the future. He surely hasn't had much luck or encouragement so far. Sheila Harrison, Wales Next week Three and a half years ago my much-loved surviving parent died. Two months later my partner of 18 years left me for someone he had been having an affair with. I was left with debts. I have lots of lovely people in my life - siblings, nieces, nephews, godchildren, good friends and a good social network. I have switched to a worthwhile and interesting job, have paid off the debts and sorted out the legal problems on our jointly owned flat. However, I still feel overwhelmed by depression. I have had counselling, bereavement counselling, psychotherapy, drug therapy, and hypnotherapy. I have taken holidays and have spent money on nice things to do. But on an almost daily basis I think about suicide. I have no interest in my appearance, finding a new partner, sex, making new friends or planning for the future. I have become horribly forgetful about other people and their needs. Can anyone suggest what I can do or try, to help me recover from this unhappy existence?",

      "body": "<p>A couple of hours into a transatlantic flight two years ago my eyes came to rest on the meal trays around me. My neighbours had tucked into the salad and then a choice of fish, chicken or vegetarian main course, but had all sternly denied themselves the dessert - a confection of sponge and bakers cream sandwiched between two brittle chocolate wafers.</p> <p>There was nothing wrong with the pudding; in fact, I ate it all. But this must have been one of the very few times that I have. For there is an unspoken rule that to swoop too eagerly on the in-flight sweet is uncool. This particularly applies in business class, which is full of trim executives who seem to view the issue of pudding consumption as little less than a psychometric test. To eat the pudding manifestly compromises your fitness for battle and ascent.</p> <p>This is scarcely rational. Most of the business-class passengers were disdaining a slightly upgraded version of our pudding for a selection of cheese - triangles of cheddar, stilton and brie, biscuits and one or two grapes. Some even took port or brandy, too. So, plainly the decision to jettison the pudding was not taken on health or dietary grounds.</p> <p>Suffering only usual restlessness on a long flight, I decided to broaden my survey and took a stroll round the cabin. I found that about six out of 10 chocolate sandwiches had been ignored. Some had been tried and then rejected, while the rest were eaten. The wastage was about 65%.</p> <p>Over the next year or so during which I took 25 flights while researching a book, I witnessed much the same pattern, although the rates of consumption did vary. I estimated the minimum dessert wastage to be about 40% and the maximum 75%. I began to wonder why airlines do not simply calculate the average consumption and cater for that number, rather than offering desserts to everyone.</p> <p>But this course would challenge two subtle conventions of air travel. The first is that most airlines, however modest, like to think of themselves as providers of comfort, even luxury. The idea of a passenger going without pudding and then leaving the aircraft feeling hard done by troubles them. Second, to remove the standard dessert from the menu would penalise all those people who derive pleasure from conspicuous self-denial.</p> <p>Airlines, one suspects, have come to the conclusion that eating or rejecting pudding in the air gives roughly the same pleasure to different sorts of people. Naturally, it is never easy to gauge which sort of people you are about to carry and there is no attempt made by the airlines to ask passengers when they book their flight, or when they check in, whether they are pudding eaters. \"Dessert, or non-dessert section, madam?\"</p> <p>As you become gripped by the airline pudding issue, as I have been, you wonder at the vast waste and wretchedness caused by our failure to address it like adults.</p> <p>Let's take the misery of the airline chef first. Worldwide, there must be hundreds, maybe thousands of men and women who enter the catering profession with the hope of a fulfilling career, only to end up in the dead end of producing millions of puddings that are thrown away. Nothing could be more fruitless and dispiriting. Occasionally you can sense a pudding chef at the end of his tether, as I did last year during a US domestic flight when I was confronted with a greenish, near-viscous substance (think of Swarfega cleaning gel) bearing morello cherries and stewed figs. What was next for this man? Insanity? A life on the streets raving about pannacotta and lime grass sauce?</p> <p>Still, one has to admit that airline caterers are a robust breed. After 30 years in the business, George Banks of British Airways still works up enthusiasm for air meals. Aside from being the likely author of the phrase \"retro dessert\" (blancmange, bread and butter pudding, spotted dick, lemon and meringue pie), he is also menu and service style development manager with BA and is exceptionally knowledgeable about puddings.</p> <p>He doubts my figures, because he says airlines such as BA sometimes have \"inbound checks\", which means that a team of catering researchers go though hundreds of used trays to see what has and hasn't been eaten.</p> <p>He concedes that it is not a particularly nice job, but they do it to establish whether a cold rice pudding has gone down well or not (I'd guess the odds are on not). Besides this there are criteria which every pudding ever served on BA is judged by - simplicity, tastiness, healthiness, authenticity, variety, seasonality and visual appeal. He points out that pressurisation results in a loss of taste and that chefs have to try particularly hard to entice, and then satisfy, a passenger with dessert.</p> <p>Whatever Banks's standards and the professionalism of BA, I know that wastage is huge and I decided to get a rough idea of the actual number of puddings being thrown away untried.</p> <p>Figures just released show that 1.6bn passengers were carried by commercial airlines in 2000. Of these about 500m travelled on domestic flights, the great proportion of which were in north America.</p> <p>Some of these flights lasted no more than an hour, during which time passengers were lucky to get a cheese cracker or sandwiches. If there was a sweet, it usually didn't amount to more than a bought-in cup cake, which doesn't count in the sophisticated world of in-flight desserts. So let's agree to reduce the numbers of passengers confronted with some form of sweet during 2000 to 1bn.</p> <p>Let's also agree that my observations are exaggerated by 15 percentage points. To be on the safe side, we'll make that 20 percentage points That gives us a cautious wastage rate with a range of between 20% and 55% of all puddings.</p> <p>The mean wastage rate therefore is 37.5%, which gives us a figure for last year of 375m untouched desserts. Even if you halve in order to be scrupulously fair, you get 187.5m, which is still an awful lot of pudding to say nothing of calories, effort, money, ingenuity and time, to throw away each year, especially when you consider the annual increase in air travel. By 2020 the world's airlines expect to carry 4bn people which means something like 450m desserts will be junked.</p> <p>By then, let's hope we have begun to think about waste a little more seriously.</p>",

For there is an unspoken rule that to swoop too eagerly on the in-flight sweet is uncool. This particularly applies in business class, which is full of trim executives who seem to view the issue of pudding consumption as little less than a psychometric test. To eat the pudding manifestly compromises your fitness for battle and ascent. This is scarcely rational. Most of the business-class passengers were disdaining a slightly upgraded version of our pudding for a selection of cheese - triangles of cheddar, stilton and brie, biscuits and one or two grapes. Some even took port or brandy, too. So, plainly the decision to jettison the pudding was not taken on health or dietary grounds. Suffering only usual restlessness on a long flight, I decided to broaden my survey and took a stroll round the cabin. I found that about six out of 10 chocolate sandwiches had been ignored. Some had been tried and then rejected, while the rest were eaten. The wastage was about 65%. Over the next year or so during which I took 25 flights while researching a book, I witnessed much the same pattern, although the rates of consumption did vary. I estimated the minimum dessert wastage to be about 40% and the maximum 75%. I began to wonder why airlines do not simply calculate the average consumption and cater for that number, rather than offering desserts to everyone. But this course would challenge two subtle conventions of air travel. The first is that most airlines, however modest, like to think of themselves as providers of comfort, even luxury. The idea of a passenger going without pudding and then leaving the aircraft feeling hard done by troubles them. Second, to remove the standard dessert from the menu would penalise all those people who derive pleasure from conspicuous self-denial. Airlines, one suspects, have come to the conclusion that eating or rejecting pudding in the air gives roughly the same pleasure to different sorts of people. Naturally, it is never easy to gauge which sort of people you are about to carry and there is no attempt made by the airlines to ask passengers when they book their flight, or when they check in, whether they are pudding eaters. \"Dessert, or non-dessert section, madam?\" As you become gripped by the airline pudding issue, as I have been, you wonder at the vast waste and wretchedness caused by our failure to address it like adults. Let's take the misery of the airline chef first. Worldwide, there must be hundreds, maybe thousands of men and women who enter the catering profession with the hope of a fulfilling career, only to end up in the dead end of producing millions of puddings that are thrown away. Nothing could be more fruitless and dispiriting. Occasionally you can sense a pudding chef at the end of his tether, as I did last year during a US domestic flight when I was confronted with a greenish, near-viscous substance (think of Swarfega cleaning gel) bearing morello cherries and stewed figs. What was next for this man? Insanity? A life on the streets raving about pannacotta and lime grass sauce? Still, one has to admit that airline caterers are a robust breed. After 30 years in the business, George Banks of British Airways still works up enthusiasm for air meals. Aside from being the likely author of the phrase \"retro dessert\" (blancmange, bread and butter pudding, spotted dick, lemon and meringue pie), he is also menu and service style development manager with BA and is exceptionally knowledgeable about puddings. He doubts my figures, because he says airlines such as BA sometimes have \"inbound checks\", which means that a team of catering researchers go though hundreds of used trays to see what has and hasn't been eaten. He concedes that it is not a particularly nice job, but they do it to establish whether a cold rice pudding has gone down well or not (I'd guess the odds are on not). Besides this there are criteria which every pudding ever served on BA is judged by - simplicity, tastiness, healthiness, authenticity, variety, seasonality and visual appeal. He points out that pressurisation results in a loss of taste and that chefs have to try particularly hard to entice, and then satisfy, a passenger with dessert. Whatever Banks's standards and the professionalism of BA, I know that wastage is huge and I decided to get a rough idea of the actual number of puddings being thrown away untried. Figures just released show that 1.6bn passengers were carried by commercial airlines in 2000. Of these about 500m travelled on domestic flights, the great proportion of which were in north America. Some of these flights lasted no more than an hour, during which time passengers were lucky to get a cheese cracker or sandwiches. If there was a sweet, it usually didn't amount to more than a bought-in cup cake, which doesn't count in the sophisticated world of in-flight desserts. So let's agree to reduce the numbers of passengers confronted with some form of sweet during 2000 to 1bn. Let's also agree that my observations are exaggerated by 15 percentage points. To be on the safe side, we'll make that 20 percentage points That gives us a cautious wastage rate with a range of between 20% and 55% of all puddings. The mean wastage rate therefore is 37.5%, which gives us a figure for last year of 375m untouched desserts. Even if you halve in order to be scrupulously fair, you get 187.5m, which is still an awful lot of pudding to say nothing of calories, effort, money, ingenuity and time, to throw away each year, especially when you consider the annual increase in air travel. By 2020 the world's airlines expect to carry 4bn people which means something like 450m desserts will be junked. By then, let's hope we have begun to think about waste a little more seriously.",

      "body": "<p>Rob Dawber, who was emerging as a writer after his years as a railwayman, has died aged 45. The cause was mesothelioma, a cancer contracted while working with asbestos on the railways. Last year, he won a significant victory in establishing his employers' culpability for his illness.</p> <p>Rob was educated at Wath-upon-Dearne grammar school in South Yorkshire, and read politics and English at Leicester University. He decided against the expected middle-class career, in place of which he took a job on the railways. This was partly because of his political commitment; Rob was of that generation of socialists who were inspired by the trade union struggles of the 1970s. Also, as he said, he wanted to work alongside people he liked.</p> <p>For 18 years, he was a rail worker and trade union activist. He became a branch secretary for the National Union of Railwaymen, and wrote for Socialist Organiser and Off The Rails, a bulletin for rail workers. His Fat Controller column mercilessly lampooned the rail managers who squandered the opportunities of the nationalised industries.</p> <p>During the miners' strike, Rob toured signal boxes run by rail workers who supported the strike, to maintain solidarity with the miners. Later, he stood as presidential candidate for the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, to oppose privatisation and the consequent risks to health and safety.</p> <p>When privatisation finally came, Rob was made redundant. As a militant, his prospects in Sheffield, where so many jobs had disappeared, were not good. So he decided to write. His first script, which I was lucky enough to be sent, was full of life, characters and stories. It was about the break-up of the railways into private companies and sub-contractors.</p> <p>A week after he was commissioned to develop his original material, Rob was given the shattering news that he was terminally ill. He had fought all his life against the undermining of trade unions and the impact that had on health and safety. Ironically, he was to pay a higher price than most. With others, he had been given the job of breaking up troughs and other items, known by British Rail to contain asbestos, in a decrepit shed with an asbestos roof. The mesothelioma which resulted lay dormant for nearly 20 years until it was diagnosed in December 1998, when Rob was 42.</p> <p>Rob's reaction was to fight it to the end, and get on with what mattered to him. Furious with the medics for their lack of optimism, he decided \"to outlive you all\". He searched for treatments throughout the world, and prepared to try the most aggressive therapies that were still in their infancy. His family and friends set up the Rob Dawber Mesothelioma Campaign to fund any possible treatment abroad, and to expose the disease as one which affects working people doing dirty jobs without adequate protection.</p> <p>Rob's fight also resulted in a landmark court judgment against the residual rail company left after privatisation. It was the first time that an employer was found liable for intermittent exposure out of doors, primarily to white asbestos. An internal memo revealed that, although workers were being routinely exposed to lethal asbestos, it would be too expensive to remove it all or educate them in ways of handling it. The substantial damages went to the campaign.</p> <p>Two anniversaries of his diagnosis were celebrated, and Rob's family and friends began to believe that perhaps he could defy this most crushing of diseases through his formidable willpower. He took great delight in seeing his film completed, and became the centre of much laughter on the set. Despite failing health, he refused to retreat from political life. He allowed his name to go forward as a possible parliamentary candidate for the newly-created Socialist Alliance.</p> <p>I never heard him express bitterness or self-pity. His strength, good humour and integrity were an inspiration to all who knew him. He was devoted to his wife, Lindsey, and his daughters, Chloe and Eve, from his first marriage, to Ellen, were the light of his life. Working people have lost a champion.</p> <p>\u0095 Robert Dawber, railwayman and writer, born January 8 1956; died February 20 2001.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rob Dawber, who was emerging as a writer after his years as a railwayman, has died aged 45. The cause was mesothelioma, a cancer contracted while working with asbestos on the railways. Last year, he won a significant victory in establishing his employers' culpability for his illness. Rob was educated at Wath-upon-Dearne grammar school in South Yorkshire, and read politics and English at Leicester University. He decided against the expected middle-class career, in place of which he took a job on the railways. This was partly because of his political commitment; Rob was of that generation of socialists who were inspired by the trade union struggles of the 1970s. Also, as he said, he wanted to work alongside people he liked. For 18 years, he was a rail worker and trade union activist. He became a branch secretary for the National Union of Railwaymen, and wrote for Socialist Organiser and Off The Rails, a bulletin for rail workers. His Fat Controller column mercilessly lampooned the rail managers who squandered the opportunities of the nationalised industries. During the miners' strike, Rob toured signal boxes run by rail workers who supported the strike, to maintain solidarity with the miners. Later, he stood as presidential candidate for the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, to oppose privatisation and the consequent risks to health and safety. When privatisation finally came, Rob was made redundant. As a militant, his prospects in Sheffield, where so many jobs had disappeared, were not good. So he decided to write. His first script, which I was lucky enough to be sent, was full of life, characters and stories. It was about the break-up of the railways into private companies and sub-contractors. A week after he was commissioned to develop his original material, Rob was given the shattering news that he was terminally ill. He had fought all his life against the undermining of trade unions and the impact that had on health and safety. Ironically, he was to pay a higher price than most. With others, he had been given the job of breaking up troughs and other items, known by British Rail to contain asbestos, in a decrepit shed with an asbestos roof. The mesothelioma which resulted lay dormant for nearly 20 years until it was diagnosed in December 1998, when Rob was 42. Rob's reaction was to fight it to the end, and get on with what mattered to him. Furious with the medics for their lack of optimism, he decided \"to outlive you all\". He searched for treatments throughout the world, and prepared to try the most aggressive therapies that were still in their infancy. His family and friends set up the Rob Dawber Mesothelioma Campaign to fund any possible treatment abroad, and to expose the disease as one which affects working people doing dirty jobs without adequate protection. Rob's fight also resulted in a landmark court judgment against the residual rail company left after privatisation. It was the first time that an employer was found liable for intermittent exposure out of doors, primarily to white asbestos. An internal memo revealed that, although workers were being routinely exposed to lethal asbestos, it would be too expensive to remove it all or educate them in ways of handling it. The substantial damages went to the campaign. Two anniversaries of his diagnosis were celebrated, and Rob's family and friends began to believe that perhaps he could defy this most crushing of diseases through his formidable willpower. He took great delight in seeing his film completed, and became the centre of much laughter on the set. Despite failing health, he refused to retreat from political life. He allowed his name to go forward as a possible parliamentary candidate for the newly-created Socialist Alliance. I never heard him express bitterness or self-pity. His strength, good humour and integrity were an inspiration to all who knew him. He was devoted to his wife, Lindsey, and his daughters, Chloe and Eve, from his first marriage, to Ellen, were the light of his life. Working people have lost a champion. \u0095 Robert Dawber, railwayman and writer, born January 8 1956; died February 20 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Will the cavalcade of international policy makers descending on London on Monday to discuss how to tackle child poverty come up with anything more durable than the millions of words spoken on behalf of noble causes at conferences from Rio to Tokyo in the past decade? The chancellor, Gordon Brown, says the London meeting with be different. The UN's social summit in Copenhagen in 1995 set three key goals to be achieved by 2015 - to halve the number of people living in absolute poverty, cut infant mortality by two-thirds and put every child in primary school. On current trends, these things are not going to happen. Some projections indicate that some targets might conceivably be met in a narrow numerical sense if India and China, the two most populous countries in the world, continue to enjoy robust economic growth. But in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, there is no chance of the goals being met without intervention by local governments and western donors. The latest World Bank figures for the the region show incomes per head still falling and life expectancy plunging due to Aids. Education, the key to better health and an ascent out of poverty, is likely to prove the acid test of the new initiatives. In an interview with the Guardian the chancellor argued that responsibility for hitting the targets has for too long been shuffled between institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the UN. Now, he wants the real powerhouse of the global economy, the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - to take charge. This more activist approach is being urged on the G7 by Britain and Italy, which currently chairs the meetings of the group. Many in the aid agencies have long said that real progress cannot come unless politicians force the slow-moving global organisations to act. Governments, they argue, should work harder to shape the global economy rather than leave it to market forces that mean, for example, that multinational drugs companies have little or no incentive to sell cheap generic drugs to combat the likes of TB, diarrhoea and malaria. Second, they believe that the G7 collectively should nudge the IMF and World Bank away from focussing on narrow financial targets, such as low inflation and balanced budgets, and towards poverty reduction as a prime target. One of the chancellor's specific goals is to make meeting the 2015 targets a central part of the IMF and World Bank programmes. Jim Wolfensohn, the bank's president, and Horst Koehler, managing director of the IMF - both of whom will be at Monday's conference after a week touring Africa - are seen as key allies in development of the new approach. There are hurdles to overcome before a new campaign based on achieving the 2015 targets can get off the ground, not least the unfinished business of debt relief for the world's poorest countries - the subject of an ongoing campaign led by the Jubilee 2000 group. While 22 countries have begun receiving debt relief under the enhanced programme launched by the IMF and World Bank at Cologne in 1999, many more have yet to meet the criteria. Supporters are urging that this campaign not be allowed to run into the sand. Another potential obstacle is the uncertain attitude of the new American administration. It will be difficult to persuade free marketeers such as George Bush to spend more US taxpayers' money on poverty reduction. Also key to the success of an anti-poverty drive with children particularly in mind will be participation by the private sector, especially in tackling preventable diseases. Mr Brown sees Monday's conference as the first step leading to September's UN special session on children. A cast list that includes Nelson Mandela and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, who will both address the London meeting by video link, is meant to give the issue a good kick-start. But deeds are what will decide whether the conference is more than a feel-good session for policy makers which has no real impact on the ground.",

      "bodyText": "The Briton kidnapped in Bangladesh, Tim Selby, yesterday said that he and two Danes were growing increasingly weak after seven days in the jungle. Mr Selby, 28, was seized by tribal bandits in the Chittagong hills on Friday in south-east Bangladesh. In a letter delivered via intermediaries, he urged the authorities trying to negotiate his release to call off army patrols in the area. He wrote: \"Our health is deteriorating rapidly and we are growing weak. It is vital [underlined] that you call off the army patrol and it is also vital [underlined] that you stop the army from interfering with tribal women. Signed Tim Selby.\" British diplomats say the letter may have been written under duress. There are unconfirmed reports that one hostage has received \"bruising\" either from a fall or from the captors. The report of poor health comes amid signs that negotiations are going nowhere. The kidnappers flagged down Mr Selby's four-wheel drive vehicle while he and the Danes were surveying a Danish-financed road project near the hill station of Rangamati. Another Briton, David Weston, and the group's Bangladeshi driver, were also abducted but later released to convey a \u00a31.2m ransom demand for the remaining three. A team of trained hostage negotiators from the Metropolitan police is likely to fly to Bangladesh next week to assist with the operation. Its presence has become all the more urgent after a storm blew over the hills yesterday, drenching the jungle in hours of rain. It is not clear whether Mr Selby is being kept under shelter or has been marched deep into the teak forests along the borders with Burma and India. The army says it has trapped the kidnap gang within a 30 sq km area. But yesterday three armed men ambushed a local TV crew on the same road less than 5km (three miles) from where Mr Selby was captured; they let the crew go for 1,000 taka, or \u00a312.

      "bodyText": "An international human rights watchdog has denounced the proliferation of state-backed human rights and truth commissions in Africa as a sham. Human Rights Watch believes that many are simply being used to cover up abuses by some of the world's most oppressive regimes. In a 400-page report released yesterday, the group also criticised western governments and the UN for funding, and thereby lending unwarranted legitimacy to, such commissions which it claims have have little interest in curbing human rights abuses. \"By 2000, Africa was host to the largest number of government human rights commissions of any continent. Yet its human rights record, by and large, stands in stark contrast with this fact,\" said Human Rights Watch. \"For the most part [the commissions] have proved to be a disappointment. Many have indeed been formed by governments with dismal human rights records, weak state institutions, and no history of autonomous state bodies. Some appear largely designed to deflect international criticism of some serious human rights abuses.\" A decade ago, there was just one state human rights commission in Africa - in Togo. Now there are 20, in almost half the countries on the continent. Four more commissions are on the way. The watchdog accuses some African states of \"jumping on the human rights bandwagon\" without any real interest in genuinely respecting them. Human rights are in vogue now in much the same way as elections were fashionable a decade ago, a time when, under pressure from western aid donors at the end of the cold war, African states staged elections with little real commitment to establishing genuinely democratic governments. Similar plans to placate western donors are often behind the establishment of rights commissions, it said. Some commissions - notably in South Africa, Ghana and Uganda - have genuinely exposed abuses and challenged government practices. South Africa's commission criticised official inaction over rampant and sometimes violent xenophobia, and police torture. In Uganda, commissioners have used judicial powers to force the authorities to account for abuses. But elsewhere - from Liberia to Kenya, Sudan to Malawi - commissions are being used to dress up the country's image overseas and deflect criticism of the government's inability to liberalise, the group said. \"Millions of Africans are being displaced, tortured or killed. Yet the sad truth is that human rights commissioners in Africa often turn a blind eye to these abuses,\" said the report's author, Binaifer Nowrojee. \"Many commissioners fail to publicly denounce abuses, either from fear of retribution or out of hope of government favour.\" The report says that Sudan's human rights body was set up seven years ago amid some of the worst political repression in the country and did nothing to curb such abuses. Algeria and Tunisia formed commissions simply to ward off international criticism of the state crackdowns on Islamic political groups, the report said. \"In the late 1990s, the postwar governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone created human rights commissions after flawed peace accords granted an amnesty to the fighters responsible for the killings and torture of thousands of civilians,\" the report said. \"The question which remains is: can these institutions that are set up by governments with less than pure motives be transformed into independent and effective human rights bodies?\" Official human rights commissions sometimes work with truth commissions; one laying bare past abuses while the other examines present day human rights breaches. The truth commissions have sometimes proved more successful, in part because the present governments are not responsible for past abuses. Nigerians were exasperated and amused to see army generals who once ruled the country with a rod of iron, and plundered much of its wealth, weeping before the country's truth commission. That, and revelations about the extent of the brutality that the military sank to during its last years in power, have probably done as much as any human rights commission to curb abuses in the future by the army.",

Or will Tony Blair surprise everyone on March 12 by dashing to Buckingham Palace in time for a vote on April 5 ?</p> <p>\"Let's get it over with,\" murmer some voters. Either way, party canvassers will not be the only people knocking on front doors this spring. Census day looms. Thousands of officials, known as enumerators and carrying yellow bags full of yellow and pink forms, will be out throughout April and early May, cajoling 60m people into cooperating with the 10-yearly attempt to count the British population.</p> <p>Sunday April 29 is the date. Census day was set by law two years ago - unlike the election, which, almost uniquely among advanced democracies, rests in the hands of the incumbent prime minister.</p> <p>Most pundits, politicians and voters have long since assumed the general election will be May 3, since this is local election day and four years and two days since the landslide of 1997, a respectable gap. Yet Downing Street will not confirm that date, and cabinet ministers ocasionally try to persuade a lobby correspondent Mr Blair will decide to get it over with on April 5. The odds are only 60:40 on May 3, according to a BBC pundit.</p> <p>Under election law 17 working days' notice is required; Monday March 12 is the last day to announce the April 5 option.

      "bodyText": "Is polling day May 3, as almost everyone assumes? Or will Tony Blair surprise everyone on March 12 by dashing to Buckingham Palace in time for a vote on April 5 ? \"Let's get it over with,\" murmer some voters. Either way, party canvassers will not be the only people knocking on front doors this spring. Census day looms. Thousands of officials, known as enumerators and carrying yellow bags full of yellow and pink forms, will be out throughout April and early May, cajoling 60m people into cooperating with the 10-yearly attempt to count the British population. Sunday April 29 is the date. Census day was set by law two years ago - unlike the election, which, almost uniquely among advanced democracies, rests in the hands of the incumbent prime minister. Most pundits, politicians and voters have long since assumed the general election will be May 3, since this is local election day and four years and two days since the landslide of 1997, a respectable gap. Yet Downing Street will not confirm that date, and cabinet ministers ocasionally try to persuade a lobby correspondent Mr Blair will decide to get it over with on April 5. The odds are only 60:40 on May 3, according to a BBC pundit. Under election law 17 working days' notice is required; Monday March 12 is the last day to announce the April 5 option. That would be five days after Gordon Brown's fifth budget - one which will allow the chancellor to be prudently generous. \"Budget lift-off,\" as one Labour official put it yesterday. John Major did it in 1992, winning on April 9 against the odds after calling it on March 11, the day after Norman Lamont's budget had introduced a 20p tax band and shaken the City by doubling the projected debt burden.

It would also avoid the campaign being disrupted by Easter week, April 15-22, and mixed up with the census on April 29. Charles Kennedy, the Lib Dem leader, has publicly told his troops to be ready for April 5. Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, told her staff \"we must assume it is May 3\" weeks ago, though, like the Tories, she must keep an eye on an earlier option.

Detectives continued to follow up leads over the years without success, arresting a suspect in 1991 but releasing him without charge. Police said he was not the man being questioned yesterday.</p> <p>Last year Surrey police opened an incident room at Staines and put 22 officers on the case after a review identified potential new lines of inquiry. They hoped that new investigative techniques and scientific methods would help them to track down the killer.</p> <p>In January this year they invited 60 officers involved in the original inquiry to pool their knowledge with those currently working on the case.\"This murder caused a tremendous amount of emotion in Surrey,\" said detective superintendent Dave Cook, who is leading the inquiry. \"It was a very high profile case that was never solved. We re-opened it because methods of investigation have moved on, but the knowledge of the officers who worked on the original inquiry was invaluable.</p> <p>\"They were the vital bridge between the past and present. Their thoughts and memories proved a valuable tool in helping us understand what had taken place back then.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Roy Tutill's blazer and the books he was carrying have been carefully kept and it brought tears to the eyes just to look at them and think what that poor young boy went through.\"</p> <p>Roy was last spotted thumbing a lift in Leatherhead Road, Hook. He was thought to have been picked up by a stocky, grey-haired man in an Austin Westminster grey saloon. There was speculation at the time that Roy had been murdered by a paedophile ring, but police refused to say whether they were seeking more than one person in connection with the death.</p> <p>Roy's father died two years after the murder and his mother died in 1996. His brother Colin and sister Margaret are still alive and police are keeping them informed of developments.</p>",

A huge team of officers interviewed more than 10,000 people and took 2,000 written statements in the months following the murder, but were unable to find the killer. Detectives continued to follow up leads over the years without success, arresting a suspect in 1991 but releasing him without charge. Police said he was not the man being questioned yesterday. Last year Surrey police opened an incident room at Staines and put 22 officers on the case after a review identified potential new lines of inquiry. They hoped that new investigative techniques and scientific methods would help them to track down the killer. In January this year they invited 60 officers involved in the original inquiry to pool their knowledge with those currently working on the case.\"This murder caused a tremendous amount of emotion in Surrey,\" said detective superintendent Dave Cook, who is leading the inquiry. \"It was a very high profile case that was never solved. We re-opened it because methods of investigation have moved on, but the knowledge of the officers who worked on the original inquiry was invaluable. \"They were the vital bridge between the past and present. Their thoughts and memories proved a valuable tool in helping us understand what had taken place back then.\" He added: \"Roy Tutill's blazer and the books he was carrying have been carefully kept and it brought tears to the eyes just to look at them and think what that poor young boy went through.\" Roy was last spotted thumbing a lift in Leatherhead Road, Hook. He was thought to have been picked up by a stocky, grey-haired man in an Austin Westminster grey saloon. There was speculation at the time that Roy had been murdered by a paedophile ring, but police refused to say whether they were seeking more than one person in connection with the death. Roy's father died two years after the murder and his mother died in 1996. His brother Colin and sister Margaret are still alive and police are keeping them informed of developments.",

There are plenty of very fine performances around, but relatively few great ones, and fewer still of those have been made in the digital age. You have to go back two decades and more for the last genuinely outstanding discs - by Martha Argerich (who has not made any solo studio recordings since) and Maurizio Pollini (whose playing now never quite recaptures the spontaneity and personality it had in the 1970s). But Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin's new recital unquestionably deserves a place right alongside them. </p> <p>The Canadian-born Hamelin made his name with startlingly brilliant performances of Valentin Alkan's over-the-top 19th-century piano works, but in recital and on disc he has steadily broadened his range, and demonstrated that he is very much more than a fast-fingered technician. The clinching evidence of his completeness as an interpreter comes on this disc. </p> <p>That all three works are immaculately played almost goes without saying - the closing second of the second movement of the C major Fantasy is a notoriously revealing test for any pianist, which even some of the greatest Schumann interpreters have failed, but Hamelin sails through it. His tempo seems unsustainable when he sets out, but he triumphantly vindicates it by the end. </p> <p>But there really is much more to his performances here than just keyboard brilliance. Hamelin makes even the more tendentious of Schumann's formal schemes (that of the G minor Sonata, for instance) totally organic through his thoughtful dovetailing of sections, and by the way in which he relates the tempo of each section to that of the next. Every phrase is shaped by his easy, never self-conscious rubato. Each of the variations in the Etudes Symphoniques (Schumann's original version, without the \"posthumous\" numbers that some pianists interpolate) is deftly and instantly characterised, and the big-boned finale generates a thrilling head of steam. </p> <p>Only at the very beginning of the Fantasy is there a suspicion that the expressiveness is a bit too generalised, and that the edges are softened more than is required by this most classically structured of all Schumann's piano works. But those reservations are quickly swept aside by the sheer magnificence of the playing that follows, in which the ebb and flow of the invention is plotted so vividly. </p> <p>Hamelin's account of the G minor Sonata, with a genuinely searching slow movement and a dazzling dispatch of the final Presto, stands up proudly against any other on record - even Argerich's much more impulsive version from the early 1970s, and Horowitz's famous old account - and it makes a fascinating comparison with that by the much-respected Russian pianist and teacher Eliso Virsaladze, on one of the latest in the Live Classics series. </p> <p>Virsaladze's performances of the G minor Sonata and Waldszenen were recorded at a recital in Moscow in 1973; the F sharp minor Sonata dates from Moscow in 1980. There is a great deal to admire in all three. The sleeve notes, which are otherwise pretty perfunctory, include a panegyric from Sviatoslav Richter about these very performances - \"Can one imagine a more beautiful Schumann than Eliso offered us this evening?\" - and it is easy to see how in the concert hall these would have been compellingly vivid. </p> <p>Virsaladze attacks both sonatas with physical relish; she does not attempt the tonal refinement and clarity that Hamelin brings to the G minor, but ratchets up the excitement notch by notch. Subtlety isn't her objective, though in the miniatures of Waldszenen she captures the melodic essence of each with directness and much charm. As a document of one of the most important figures in recent Russian piano playing, it is all well worth hearing. </p> <p>For good or bad, the reissue of Wilhelm Kempff's Schumann collection from 1973 and 1974 really does sound now like playing from another age. Kempff was then in his late 70s, and had lost the sense of freshness and simple directness that made him a favourite pianist of the early LP age. All three works here, even the simple lyrics of Kinderszenen and Waldszenen, get rather bumpy rides, with unaccountable lapses of continuity and laboured expressiveness, even though Kempff's clear, singing tone sometimes comes across. But the surging energy of Kreisleriana simply defeats him: this is one of Schumann's piano works whose sheer ebullience must be difficult to recapture in the tranquillity of old age. Kempff admirers will already have these performances from their earlier incarnations; those looking for authoritative accounts of these three works would do much better to look elsewhere.</p>",

He goes to war, and his experiences - on which Redford does not dwell - are enough to make him give up golf and Adele, develop designer stubble and take to the bottle in what is supposed to be squalor, but what looks mysteriously like a squat in a large and elegant mansion.

The poor pinched-faced mixed infants have to endure much bizarre haranguing from schoolmistress and cleric alike, and there is a gloomy sermon on the subject of hell's eternity that the priest has plagiarised from Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. These scenes, and many others, look a lot like sequences from Alan Parker's underrated Angela's Ashes.

But the comic confection of that moment is almost unique in the stern, salty porridge of gloom that Frears is serving up. And in Liam there often seems to be a gap where the humanity and the humour are supposed to go. No one should need or expect palliatives in a movie dealing with serious issues, but I couldn't help feeling that a director like Terence Davies would have dealt with them quite as unflinchingly, but found epiphanies and moments of redemptive meaning for which there seems to be no room in this film. </p> <p>When fascism makes its unlovely appearance, Frears has a very adroit scene when Dad must reveal himself to his astonished family in his black shirt for the first time; and brazen out with ugly determination what is immediately apparent to his nearest and dearest - that he looks sinister and quite absurd.

When Hart is shown directing an arsonist blackshirt mob in the final reel, we are invited to assume that he has risen through the fascist ranks to some position of power; but slightly perplexingly, this development happens off camera. Frears's camera lingers in the kitchen, in church, in the street, but not in the meeting hall or smoke-filled room. Which is a shame - some exposition of this sort might have given the film more sinew. </p> <p>Finally, we are left with a harrowing episode of violence, but it's not clear what exactly we can make of it all.

When he accompanied Eriksson to Anfield last night he took the number of matches he has seen in 3 months to 47, with 45 of them at the top level. </p> <p>Just how familiar Grip's face is in executive boxes and service stations is a tribute to the esteem in which he is held by his boss. Asked recently to pinpoint his finest qualities as a coach, Eriksson replied: \"Tord Grip\". </p> <p>The trust is plain in a relationship that dates back to the 70s and that has seen the Swedes nickname Grip \"one half of Sven-Goran's brain\". So close are the pair that they have been spotted together not just at matches but at Mamma Mia, the musical featuring the tunes of Sweden's finest, Abba. \"A very good performance,\" Grip says, for once not referring to a wannabe for today's squad. \"I like Abba's music; Benny Andersson is my favourite.\" </p> <p><strong> Men with attitude</strong><br> </p> <p> Having watched every Premiership club, Grip will have plenty of sway in the selection of the squad to play Spain on Wednesday.

You need to be able to take a challenge or a tackle without arguing and without doing silly things afterwards because players will sometimes be more provoked in international games and, if you meet players from other countries who have another culture, you must be able to deal with that. You must be very steady.\" </p> <p>Hence Grip, who won three Sweden caps, has been chatting as well as watching. At games he has been talking to managers and coaches, asking about players, picking up information. And he has made trips to training grounds as well, looking at facilities and coaching methods. He saw Bobby Robson put Newcastle through their paces and he has also visited Arsenal. </p> <p>Not that his knowledge is restricted to such simple questions as the name of Sunderland's left-back. In December Grip saw England's Under-16s lose to France at White Hart Lane in the afternoon and the Under-17s win at the Valley in the evening. \"The academies are growing and getting better,\" he says, \"so there is a future in English football, no doubt.\" </p> <p>Grip was hardly unfamiliar with Premiership football, having scouted Arsenal and Chelsea before their Champions League games against Lazio, but he sounds pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>\"What I hadn't seen was how many talented young players there are in England,\" he says. \"They need to get experience of international opponents, of course; that is the main thing. It helps that some play in the Champions League and the Uefa Cup. But they aren't all playing in Europe, so they need to get experience in the Under-21 team or the full team. You have had a lot of success with the Under-21s in the last years, so it should be a good future. Then it is up to us.\" </p> <p>By us he means the whole coaching team, including Peter Taylor, Steve McClaren and the goalkeeping specialist Ray Clemence. Yet there is a special bond between Eriksson and Grip. \"I can read his mind and perhaps he can read mine,\" says Grip, whose day-to-day involvement in training at Lazio suggests he will be more than a super-scout. </p> <p>Having first worked together at KB Karlskoga, where Grip was player-coach and Eriksson played behind him as right-back, Grip gave Eriksson his first coach ing job as his assistant at Degerfors. Since then they have worked in tandem with the Sweden Under-21s and at Lazio, and they talked regularly in the 18 years they were apart. \"We speak openly to each other,\" Grip explains. He spotted something special in Eriksson from the start. </p> <p>\"I saw his ambition as a player and a coach,\" Grip explains. \"He was not that talented a player when he started but with his ambition he went into the First Division club [KB Karlskoga] where I was manager and took a place in the team. He had the same ambition as a coach. He was determined to succeed.\" </p> <p>Grip, like Eriksson, is an honest, likeable man. Raised in a small village in the north of Sweden where he spent six years working in the bakery, he describes his new job as \"more than I could have dreamed of\". </p> <p>It says much for his unpretentiousness that to get to work at Soho Square he takes the bus or walks an hour and a quarter. \"I prefer to walk,\" he says. \"It's a lovely journey through Hyde Park and into Mayfair.\" </p> <p>Finally, after thousands of miles and 47 matches, the journey is about to begin.

      "byline": "David Lacey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Today Sven-Goran Eriksson stops watching and starts working. The results of the England coach's crash course in Premiership football will at last be disclosed when he announces his first squad for next Wednesday's friendly against Spain at Villa Park. </p> <p>Seldom has an England party been so eagerly awaited. As the first foreigner to be put in charge of the national squad he was bound to carry a certain air of mystique as he set about the business of restoring the modest fortunes of a team discomforted by Glenn Hoddle and deserted by Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>Whoever succeeded Keegan, the pool of players would have been the same. Yet there is no denying the happiness of the coincidence which brings together the wide coaching experience of Eriksson and his assistant, Tord Grip, with the healthiest crop of young players England have had for ages. </p> <p>But even with the best of crops the timing of the harvest is everything. Gather the corn too soon and its greenness becomes all too apparent; leave it too late and its value is limited. </p> <p>Today's squad will be scanned anxiously for new or nearly new names. For Wes Brown, the 21-year-old Manchester United de fender capped once by Keegan, the full England story surely begins now. For West Ham's Joe Cole a regular squad place beckons and for Ashley Cole, Arsenal's fast-maturing 20-year-old left-back, England recognition cannot be far off. </p> <p>Other fresh faces are jostling for attention: John Terry, another 20-year-old defender who at Chelsea does not look out of place alongside Marcel Desailly; Michael Carrick, only 19 but already reckoned by West Ham aficionados to have even greater potential as a midfielder than Joe Cole; and Richard Wright, the once-capped Ipswich goalkeeper who is putting some in mind of the young Gordon Banks. </p> <p>Eriksson will want to examine some of his youthful options. But since the Spain game is the only chance he will have to watch England in action before the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania at the end of next month he will not be repeating Peter Taylor's bold, if slightly bizarre, experiment in Italy by limiting his selection to players of 30 or under. </p> <p>For Eriksson building the basis of a successful side will be a familiar matter of blending promising but untried talent with international experience. He may feel he needs Teddy Sheringham, 35 in April but still the country's leading scorer along with Andy Cole, as much as Emile Heskey. </p> <p>Since Steven Gerrard, the 20-year-old quickly earmarked by Grip as a likely keystone in midfield, is again out of the Liverpool team with groin problems Eriksson could also turn in the short term to Paul Ince, in excellent form since Terry Venables took over the coaching at Middlesbrough, or even David Batty, by no means finished despite a long period of inactivity at Leeds. </p> <p>Whatever happens Eriksson will be seeking to create the backbone of a team without which talk of formations and tactics is merely idle gossip. Hoddle did have one up to the point of England's departure from the 1998 World Cup but since then the team has suffered from a series of spinal disorders. </p> <p>The retirements of Alan Shearer and Tony Adams have emphasised the need for players who will provide strong and enduring vertebrae around which the rest of a team skeleton can be formed. In this re spect Eriksson will be starting from scratch, since Keegan's sudden departure left England in a valley of dry bones. </p> <p>Of the old spinal column only David Seaman remains and after the way he was beaten by Dietmar Hamann's speculative 35-yard shot when Germany won at Wembley in England's opening World Cup qualifier last October, the Arsenal goalkeeper's international career may already be over. </p> <p>At centre-back Sol Campbell represents continuity and with Martin Keown and Gareth Southgate unfit, the Tottenham player will be a crucial figure on Wednesday and beyond. In midfield Eriksson will be looking to David Beckham and Paul Scholes for creativity and stability, although from now on Scholes's role could be more about playing off the front man, Heskey obviously. </p> <p>Speculation about Eriksson's intended formation is unlikely to end at Villa Park; if anything the Spain match will pose more questions than it answers. However it does appear that the England coach will mostly operate with a back four while permutating his midfield and attack according to circumstances. </p> <p>For the World Cup qualifier against Finland at Anfield on March 24, for instance, he might use two strikers, Heskey and Michael Owen, with Scholes, Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Nick Barmby or, at a pinch, Joe Cole, in support. For the matches in Albania and Greece he could play with one man up, Heskey say, supported by Barmby and Sheringham. Robbie Fowler, if he stays fit, could be a viable attacking option in any system. </p> <p>The Football Association hopes that, under Eriksson, England can become a genuine international force in time for the 2006 World Cup. But for this to have a better chance of happening it is essential that England qualify for the tournaments in between: the 2002 World Cup in the Far East and the 2004 European Championship in Portugal. Eriksson, then, has to start winning qualifiers immediately. </p> <p> <strong> Possible squad of 26: Goalkeepers: James</strong> (Aston Villa), <strong> Martyn</strong> (Leeds), <strong> Wright</strong> (Ipswich). <strong> Defenders: G Neville</strong> , <strong> Brown</strong> (both Man Utd), <strong> Ferdinand</strong> (Leeds), <strong> Campbell </strong> (Tottenham), <strong> Barry</strong> (Aston Villa), <strong> Gray</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> Ashley Cole</strong> (Arsenal). <strong> Midfielders: Beckham, Scholes </strong> (both Man Utd), <strong> Dyer</strong> (Newcastle), <strong> McManaman</strong> (Real Madrid),<strong> J Cole</strong> (West Ham), <strong> Ince</strong> (Middlesbrough), <strong> Parlour</strong> (Arsenal), <strong> McCann</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> Barmby</strong> (Liverpool). <strong> Strikers: Heskey, Owen, Fowler </strong> (all Liverpool), <strong> Sheringham </strong> (Man Utd), <strong> Andy Cole</strong> (Man Utd), <strong> Phillips</strong> (Sunderland), <strong> Smith</strong> (Leeds). </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Today Sven-Goran Eriksson stops watching and starts working. The results of the England coach's crash course in Premiership football will at last be disclosed when he announces his first squad for next Wednesday's friendly against Spain at Villa Park. Seldom has an England party been so eagerly awaited. As the first foreigner to be put in charge of the national squad he was bound to carry a certain air of mystique as he set about the business of restoring the modest fortunes of a team discomforted by Glenn Hoddle and deserted by Kevin Keegan. Whoever succeeded Keegan, the pool of players would have been the same. Yet there is no denying the happiness of the coincidence which brings together the wide coaching experience of Eriksson and his assistant, Tord Grip, with the healthiest crop of young players England have had for ages. But even with the best of crops the timing of the harvest is everything. Gather the corn too soon and its greenness becomes all too apparent; leave it too late and its value is limited. Today's squad will be scanned anxiously for new or nearly new names. For Wes Brown, the 21-year-old Manchester United de fender capped once by Keegan, the full England story surely begins now. For West Ham's Joe Cole a regular squad place beckons and for Ashley Cole, Arsenal's fast-maturing 20-year-old left-back, England recognition cannot be far off. Other fresh faces are jostling for attention: John Terry, another 20-year-old defender who at Chelsea does not look out of place alongside Marcel Desailly; Michael Carrick, only 19 but already reckoned by West Ham aficionados to have even greater potential as a midfielder than Joe Cole; and Richard Wright, the once-capped Ipswich goalkeeper who is putting some in mind of the young Gordon Banks. Eriksson will want to examine some of his youthful options. But since the Spain game is the only chance he will have to watch England in action before the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania at the end of next month he will not be repeating Peter Taylor's bold, if slightly bizarre, experiment in Italy by limiting his selection to players of 30 or under. For Eriksson building the basis of a successful side will be a familiar matter of blending promising but untried talent with international experience. He may feel he needs Teddy Sheringham, 35 in April but still the country's leading scorer along with Andy Cole, as much as Emile Heskey. Since Steven Gerrard, the 20-year-old quickly earmarked by Grip as a likely keystone in midfield, is again out of the Liverpool team with groin problems Eriksson could also turn in the short term to Paul Ince, in excellent form since Terry Venables took over the coaching at Middlesbrough, or even David Batty, by no means finished despite a long period of inactivity at Leeds. Whatever happens Eriksson will be seeking to create the backbone of a team without which talk of formations and tactics is merely idle gossip. Hoddle did have one up to the point of England's departure from the 1998 World Cup but since then the team has suffered from a series of spinal disorders. The retirements of Alan Shearer and Tony Adams have emphasised the need for players who will provide strong and enduring vertebrae around which the rest of a team skeleton can be formed. In this re spect Eriksson will be starting from scratch, since Keegan's sudden departure left England in a valley of dry bones. Of the old spinal column only David Seaman remains and after the way he was beaten by Dietmar Hamann's speculative 35-yard shot when Germany won at Wembley in England's opening World Cup qualifier last October, the Arsenal goalkeeper's international career may already be over. At centre-back Sol Campbell represents continuity and with Martin Keown and Gareth Southgate unfit, the Tottenham player will be a crucial figure on Wednesday and beyond. In midfield Eriksson will be looking to David Beckham and Paul Scholes for creativity and stability, although from now on Scholes's role could be more about playing off the front man, Heskey obviously. Speculation about Eriksson's intended formation is unlikely to end at Villa Park; if anything the Spain match will pose more questions than it answers. However it does appear that the England coach will mostly operate with a back four while permutating his midfield and attack according to circumstances. For the World Cup qualifier against Finland at Anfield on March 24, for instance, he might use two strikers, Heskey and Michael Owen, with Scholes, Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Nick Barmby or, at a pinch, Joe Cole, in support. For the matches in Albania and Greece he could play with one man up, Heskey say, supported by Barmby and Sheringham. Robbie Fowler, if he stays fit, could be a viable attacking option in any system. The Football Association hopes that, under Eriksson, England can become a genuine international force in time for the 2006 World Cup. But for this to have a better chance of happening it is essential that England qualify for the tournaments in between: the 2002 World Cup in the Far East and the 2004 European Championship in Portugal. Eriksson, then, has to start winning qualifiers immediately. Possible squad of 26: Goalkeepers: James (Aston Villa), Martyn (Leeds), Wright (Ipswich). Defenders: G Neville , Brown (both Man Utd), Ferdinand (Leeds), Campbell (Tottenham), Barry (Aston Villa), Gray (Sunderland), Ashley Cole (Arsenal). Midfielders: Beckham, Scholes (both Man Utd), Dyer (Newcastle), McManaman (Real Madrid), J Cole (West Ham), Ince (Middlesbrough), Parlour (Arsenal), McCann (Sunderland), Barmby (Liverpool). Strikers: Heskey, Owen, Fowler (all Liverpool), Sheringham (Man Utd), Andy Cole (Man Utd), Phillips (Sunderland), Smith (Leeds). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Yet if the style of Bartolome Esteban Murillo (1617-1682) is as sugary as churros in chocolate bought from a Sevillian street vendor, the content of his paintings of children is anything but. These are not the royal princes painted by Velazquez, or the indulged middle-class children of Murillo's Dutch contemporaries. They are poor, parentless, uncared for, forced to work for a living or starve.

      "bodyText": "The only problem with this exhibition is its title. Scenes of Childhood suggests something sweet and unthreatening. Yet if the style of Bartolome Esteban Murillo (1617-1682) is as sugary as churros in chocolate bought from a Sevillian street vendor, the content of his paintings of children is anything but. These are not the royal princes painted by Velazquez, or the indulged middle-class children of Murillo's Dutch contemporaries. They are poor, parentless, uncared for, forced to work for a living or starve. They are fruitsellers, beggars, apprentice thieves. There are not many paintings of the disinherited to set alongside the monarchs and prelates that fill Europe's art galleries.

At least the object of lust is once again an actress, not a model, but you wouldn't know it from Amanda Donohoe's monochrome performance. </p> <p>Donohoe's Mrs Robinson has two expressions: eyes open, chin flat; eyes slanted, chin jutting out. And her voice grows more angular to match, practically slicing out of her nostrils to give each cynical quip a metallic sheen. This is fine in doses, even delicious when she says of daughter Elaine \"I think Peaches is rebelling\", but her unrelenting archness is tiresome over the whole evening. </p> <p>The real trouble, however, is that it is impossible to believe in her character. Through her bouts with Benjamin in the hotel, her drunken chat with Elaine, her exasperation with her husband at the wedding, she maintains the same air of boredom. Worse still is her shyness. Here is a supposedly sophisticated woman who drops her dress to titillate, yet clings to the bedsheets like a timid teen after she has sex. It is irritatingly dishonest, and symptomatic of adapter/director Terry Johnson's deference to the story's hypocritical coyness. </p> <p>To Donohoe's credit, the play leaves no room for manoeuvre - it is populated by caricatures stuck in a groove. No matter how spirited Andres Williams's performance, his sulky sop Benjamin remains a whingeing ninny, not even happy when he gets his girl. Coral Beed has moments of real emotion as Elaine, and almost hints at character development, but she too ends the play as sappy as ever. </p> <p>But as long as there are actresses willing to strip in a soft blue light, The Graduate will run and run.
