The complex, which is Wilkinson's brainchild, is partly modelled on France's equivalent at Clairefontaine, near Paris. There will be 13 pitches, three of which will be of Premiership standard and with under-soil heating. One of them will even provide a replica of the Wembley pitch. </p> <p>\"The centre will be better than any other facility in the world,\" he said. \"There will be state of the art pitches, sports science and sports medicine.\" </p> <p>The purpose of the project, however, is not just to improve the players but also the coaches; while there are more than 50,000 Uefa-certified coaches in Germany and almost 18,000 in Holland, there are fewer than 1,000 in Britain. </p> <p>Wilkinson and around 75 staff will be based at the 350-acre site which has been chosen because of its central location. More curious is the centre's proximity to Burton, the brewing capital of England. It seems the proprietor of the nearby Rangemore Club is already preparing for the invasion of thirsty footballers. \"New members welcome,\" says the sign outside. Sven-Goran Eriksson, for one, will not be impressed. </p> <p>Darren Anderton is out of contention for England's friendly against Spain this month after suffering an achilles tendon injury, which will rule him out for at least a fortnight. </p> <p>Anderton was hoping to be included in Eriksson's first squad as England coach, which is named on February 23. But he picked up the injury at Manchester City last Saturday and will miss Tottenham's FA Cup fifth-round encounter with Stockport at White Hart Lane tomorrow. </p> <p>Roberto Mancini has brought his brief spell in English football to a premature close after flying back to Italy and informing the Leicester City manager Peter Taylor that he has no plans to return to Filbert Street. </p> <p>Taylor confirmed last night that the veteran Italian striker had left after becoming homesick during less than four weeks in the east midlands. Reports in Italy, however, suggest that Mancini is being lined up as a replacement for Fiorentina's Turkish coach Fatih Terim. </p> <p>\"It's a big blow,\" said Taylor. \"With the club's permission Roberto went back to Italy for a few personal reasons earlier in the week but we were expecting him back to return in time to play against Bristol City in the FA Cup on Saturday. </p> <p>\"Instead he has telephoned to say that he is staying in Italy. We've agreed to speak again next week but if this means that he is not coming back I am still very pleased with his contribution for the short time he was with us.\" </p> <p>Mancini was Eriksson's right-hand man at Lazio and joined Leicester on the England coach's recommendation on a month-long contract that was expected to be renewed until the end of the season. </p> <p>There was better news yesterday for Arsenal as Gilles Grimandi agreed terms for a new contract which will keep him at Highbury next season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Steve Archibald insists he now has nothing to do with Airdrie Football Club after his contract was terminated by liquidators KPMG.

The unit would: \u0095 Make recommendations on sensible speed limits \u0095 Tackle the problem of roads being repeatedly dug up by utility companies \u0095 Find ways to reduce road casualty numbers \u0095 Advise ministers on vital road improvements for better traffic flow: \u0095 Assess new roads for their impact on the environment and advise against roads being built \"on the cheap\".

It started sunnily enough with me walking, sunbathing and swimming on a beach on the beautiful island of Pangkor. I did manage to burn my ankles, hitherto covered by either trousers or walking socks, but it was lovely to just relax. That was the last rest I achieved as half of the insect/reptile/rodent life of the island decided to join me in my chalet that night. Normally fairly ok about creepy crawlies I confess to terror at the scampering, rustling and chomping that was going on around me in the dark. It was no good burying my head in my sleeping sheet, and I ended up just dozing with the light on all night. Even that was interrupted by torrential rain that started in the small hours and carried on until late morning. No last sunbathe and swim before returning to Kuala Lumpur. </p> <p>The rest of the week I have been tasting how the other half holiday. My sister Maureen and her husband Ray changed their original plan to use a timeshare week in Cuba to meet up with me in KL. So I have been staying in the second bedroom of the executive suite at the holiday resort. Impressed? I am with the swimming pool, maid service, FREE internet (although it doesn't work very well), bar (drinks very expensive) and restaurant (food very expensive). What's more they have hired a car, so no more hanging around bus stations trying to interpret timetables that are meaningless anyway, no more bone-shaking buses, just cruising along with air-con and Rachel's new tape that they brought with them. </p> <p>Sunday saw the usual late afternoon heavy shower. Walking through Chinatown, a kind stallholder decided to poke the rain off his tarpaulin - right on top of my head. I had my second hair wash of the day and was the sole entrant in the wet t-shirt competition. I still fail to see what Maureen, Ray and everyone else in the vicinity found so hysterically funny. </p> <p>Monday we drove to the Cameron Highlands along the winding roads lined with forest, passing wooden villages and roadside stalls covered with fruit. Maureen and Ray at last felt they were seeing the real Malaysia. It was beautiful in the Highlands, the steep slopes full of tea bushes with forest all around, the air cooler and fresher. We visited a tea plantation and saw the process by which the tea ends up in the teacup. Gone are the women in saris and coolie hats - the young leaves are now cut with a strimmer. We had a local 'steamboat', a sort of Chinese fondue where you cook all the raw fish, meat and veg in a pot of boiling soup in the middle of the table. A bit too many fishy slimy things for me, but I ate up all my vegetables. </p> <p>I returned the compliment by introducing Maureen and Ray to 'budget' accommodation in the delightful town of Tanah Rata. They took it well, only commenting on the lack of coffee-making facilities and the fact that you could see through the towels. On the second day we were walking in the forest when again the heavens opened with a vengeance. We must have looked a strange sight trying to huddle under two umbrellas, but we got soaked anyway. Maureen definitely won the t-shirt competition this time. </p> <p>Wednesday it rained virtually all day. We drove back along the Selengor coast road intending to see the fireflies in the evening but it never stopped raining. I am sure I heard Maureen and Ray muttering something about Cuba. One stop we did make was to buy one of the peculiar hairy things for sale along with the fruit on all the stalls in the Highlands. Bruce has offered to send a pawtograph to anyone who can tell us what it is (see <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/gallery/0,8563,433432,00.html\">picture gallery</a>). </p> <p>Thursday at last the sun shone and it was back to Selengor, first to the Taman Alam nature park, a birdwatchers' paradise. At times like this I feel very ignorant as huge predatory and small wading birds swoop around unnamed. On that beautiful night we took the river boat at Kuala Kuantan to see the fireflies. It was another of those magical experiences that will stay with me. Millions of fireflies turned a long stretch of riverbank into a forest of dainty Christmas lights, twinkling in harmony. With the stars above and the reflection in the water it was breathtakingly beautiful, leaving us spellbound and speechless. Thank goodness we made the second attempt to see it. </p> <p>Today I am in Melaka, a fascinating place that I should be looking round, but instead I'm in a net cafe writing to you - one of the few disadvantages of interactive travelling. Tomorrow I leave for Bali. When I originally booked this trip, I left myself a lot of time in this part of Asia, intending to go to Thailand or even further afield. I have ended up spending it all in Malaysia. I do not regret this as I feel I have had a real taste of this lovely country with its magnificent scenery, friendly hospitable people and delicious food. </p> <p>Bruce has asked me to thank everyone for his emails, especially class six at Highfield Special School (<a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netjetters/sue/feedback/story/0,8583,438812,00.html\">read the email</a>), who allowed Bruce to come with me. He would like to answer them himself but hotmail have not yet been able to recruit a programmer who is bearlingual. Maybe one day. We both enjoy reading all the emails and just wish there was more time to answer them all properly. It really seems as though we have a lot of companions with us every step of the way, which feels good. Thank you all.</p>",

It's a highly complex issue, fraught with problems and lacking solutions. The white paper offers options but will not solve the problem. If the threshold for detention is high, then dangerous people will be excluded and more tragic crimes, such as Diego's killing, will happen. And if you have a low threshold, you will eat up resources and, most importantly, ruin the lives of people who wouldn't have harmed others. The implications for civil liberties, public safety and for mental health resources are serious either way.",

Probably the main difference is whether you're a passenger or a driver. As a driver you have to maintain more than your usual share of concentration, and while negotiating hairpin bends, you won't have much opportunity to enjoy the spectacular views. Apart from crumbling edges - especially dodgy when squeezing past oncoming vehicles - there are the odd goats or camels to pass, so great care must be taken, with very low speeds at all times. I would say, do it if you're experienced at driving along narrow mountain roads, if not, leave it. Accidents there can be horrendous, and the hospitals are not too great; no view on earth is worth that risk.<br>Ann Eastman</p> <p>\u0095 We drove through the Tiz'n'Test pass in the Atlas Mountains last Easter. It was a steep mountainous drive with no barriers on the side, but if you take it carefully, the spectacular views are well worth the journey. We rented a gutless Fiat Uno, which survived remarkably well. There was only one hairy incident where we had to pass a bus that had one wheel clearly hanging over the edge. This didn't appear to faze the driver or the passengers at all. <br>Linda See</p> <p> \u0095 It's seven or eight years since I drove over this pass from south to north. It is a metalled road all the way and unless it has deteriorated badly since then should present no problems to a standard car. We crossed in early April, earlier in the year than this, in line with other Moroccan mountain roads, there is always the chance of sections washed out by snow melt not being repaired. From late March/early April onwards there should be no problem. It is quite a major route for local commercial traffic so I don't think it likely that it has deteriorated. If you have any concerns you could make enquiries with the tourist police in Marrakech who are always very helpful. If you have problems with French, most would have sufficient English for a straightforward request for information about roads. <br>Dick Scroop</p> <p> \u0095 I travelled the pass by bus last summer coming from Taroudannt. Finding a bus wasn't easy and I had the paranoid impression that people thought I must be mad! Children are not allowed on the bus due to altitude sickness; it is narrow and the danger, as always, comes in the form of other drivers. You're rewarded with a spectacular journey: looking down on circling eagles, and beautiful landscapes (punctuated with the occasional wrecks of poor souls who didn't make it!). <br>Philip Butler</p> <p> \u0095 Tizzy-making and Testing, this pass in the High Atlas is certainly passable - and best left behind. Last May, during a holiday in Taroudannt, we hired a car with a driver for a day trip up into the mountains. We made it to the fine, restored mosque at Tin-Mal, which just about justified the terrifying nature of the trip. The pass is no more than a narrow track cut into the steep, steep mountain sides. The road itself is barely wider than the antique Mercedes we travelled in, has no parapet to stop you going over the edge and down half-a-mile or so. Worse, there are blind hairpins and corners by the hundred. Most are so sharp that a vehicle is reduced to a walking pace - and you still find yourself praying that an oncoming driver is as frightened as you are. . . Needless to say, the views are spectacular, our driver was a gent, and we had a great lunch in a cafe built out over a sheer drop. But I wouldn't dream of driving it myself, and won't rush to repeat the experience. <br>Bevan Jones</p> <p> \u0095 I was driven over the Tiz'n'Test pass in April last year, when there was snow on the peaks. The pass itself is not too bad, but the approach from Marrakech is terrifying, especially if something is coming in the opposite direction. A weather check is advisable before setting off. It's not that dangerous, though. My parents have done it twice. <br>Felicia Hughes-Freeland</p> <p> \u0095 Yes, it is passable and is well worth the effort for the views the road affords. We travelled along it about three years ago taking a taxi from Taroudannt to Marrakech. The taxi driver didn't want to take the road and tried to put us off, but we found a bit more money persuaded him. The road itself is amazing and an engineering feat. At the top we had tea in a small cafe that also offered accommodation. Unfortunately the clouds didn't break for us to see the view from the top, but the winding road downwards towards Marrakech held awesome views of the Atlas mountains. Although winding and narrow it is as safe a road as the Moroccan highroads and was definitely one of the major points of our holiday. <br>Claire Moloney </p> <p> \u0095 My boyfriend and I drove over Tiz' n' Test last March. Although it is slow going, it is perfectly passable, even in a Fiat Uno. It is also well worth the effort, with beautiful views on both sides. However, the views from the pass towards Taroudannt are often obscured by cloud, especially in the afternoon, and snow does block the pass during the winter months. <br>Helen Sandwell, London</p> <p> \u0095 We were driven over Tiz'n'Test in a Mercedes taxi in February from Taroudannt to Marrakesh. It was exhilarating but not dangerous - there is room for cars to pass at most places. It's worth having a driver who knows the route - the only hazardous moments were when we met hire-cars driven by Europeans. It also means you can enjoy the stunning scenery. Good value too - the whole day out cost 1600 Dirhams (about \u00a3107) for four people. <br>Bob Rhodes</p> <p> \u0095 My husband and I travelled from Taroudannt over the Tiz'n'Test pass in the High Atlas last year. We hired a taxi for the day and the driver took us all the way through the mountains to the Tinmal mosque. The trip was breathtakingly beautiful and the road, though very winding and narrow in parts, was perfectly passable. At no point did we feel ourselves to be in danger - in fact we have experienced far more dangerous conditions in southern Spain and on certain roads in England! I would heartily recommend the journey. <br>Helen Hartstein</p> <p> \u0095 We drove over the pass in a local bus mid January this year and the road was fine. We travelled from Marrakech to Taroudannt and saw many ordinary cars on the road. The road does however need to be driven with some caution as there are also a fair amount of trucks on some very narrow sections. The road does shut after heavy snow falls so check the local weather conditions. It is however a very impressive view from the top of the pass. <br>Simon James</p> <p> \u0095 We drove over this pass in January this year. There was no snow so that was not an issue. However, the road, although perfectly OK in terms of tarmac, is rather narrow and the drop on one side, of course, is pretty dramatic. There is also a lot of gravel on the edge of the road. The biggest problem is the continual hairpin bends around the mountains so, whoever is driving, unless a very experienced driver in this sort of terrain, will not be able to appreciate the scenery as they will need to concentrate continually. I would, however, recommend the 'Berber omelette' served at the cafe immediately prior to the Pass coming up from Taroudannt! <br>Karen Wilkin</p> <p>\u0095 Don't be put off by the guide books or you will miss some amazing scenery and - possibly - 'people experiences', depending on where you stop and who you meet as you pass through the villages en route. The views alone are worth the effort, and the Berber villages on the Marrakesh side are stunning. We crossed the pass as it was snowing, just before Christmas 2000, in a hired Fiat Uno. Although the road is narrow in parts, it is perfectly negotiable even in such bad conditions. The alternative routes are significantly less attractive and interesting.<br> Rachel Parkes, Edinburgh</p>",

The appointment ends months of speculation about who would get the job, which is one of the BBC's key posts.

Mr Sambrook said he was \"delighted to have the opportunity to lead BBC News, which is renowned for its authority, impartiality and fairness\". A BBC News \"lifer\" like Tony Hall before him, Mr Sambrook has had a distinguished career at the corporation. As head of newsgathering, the department that co-ordinates the BBC's network of correspondents, Mr Sambrook presided over coverage of the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo and the death of Princess Diana.

      "body": "<p> This diary report serves a purpose. It's to stop all you poor frozen people back in England from being jealous of me - at least for a week. You see, this week has been my first real week at the hotel and I've found that they are more than happy to give us travellers a lot of work. In fact, if we wanted, we could be there practically 24/7. But as I've said before, work is a reality for a lot of young travellers - though I've mentally promised myself that the moment I begin to feel stressed, or that my enjoyment of my travels is being dampened, I'll stop. That's the wonderful thing about my year out and I'm still enjoying every minute of it.</p> <p>Thursday, the day after my evening of karaoke stardom, was a very long day. At 5.30am I was at the bus-stop having had three hours of sleep, just wondering how I was going to stay vertical until the end of the day. Fortunately, I had one of the easiest jobs of all - looking after a conference group. Basically, for nine hours I waited for them to leave the room, at which point I would leap behind a table and pour coffee. Not particularly taxing on my brain (which was lucky), and the added bonus was that I got several good feeds. In fact, I'm getting very spoilt - I'm so used to eating five-star food that it's going to be a shock when I return to the endless pasta meals I used to cook for myself!</p> <p>On Friday, as if the day before hadn't been early enough, I had to start work at 6am. When I left my apartment it was still pitch black and several people were on their way home. The crazy thing, though, was that my bus was absolutely packed - far more so than in the afternoons! At least I got to see the varieties of people who were around Circular Quay (home of the Bridge and the Opera House) at that time of day. There were several men wielding large fishing rods, a couple of people huddled under blankets or coats sleeping on benches, and a large group sat around still drinking outside a 24-hour cafe, of which Sydney has plenty. </p> <p> I was overjoyed that my day's work was over and done by 10am, leaving me some free time. In the afternoon I met up with Sam, one of the other Netjetters. It was a gorgeous, hot afternoon, so a couple of drinks in a bar on Darling Harbour seemed like the best place to go to catch up.

      "bodyText": "This diary report serves a purpose. It's to stop all you poor frozen people back in England from being jealous of me - at least for a week. You see, this week has been my first real week at the hotel and I've found that they are more than happy to give us travellers a lot of work. In fact, if we wanted, we could be there practically 24/7. But as I've said before, work is a reality for a lot of young travellers - though I've mentally promised myself that the moment I begin to feel stressed, or that my enjoyment of my travels is being dampened, I'll stop. That's the wonderful thing about my year out and I'm still enjoying every minute of it. Thursday, the day after my evening of karaoke stardom, was a very long day. At 5.30am I was at the bus-stop having had three hours of sleep, just wondering how I was going to stay vertical until the end of the day. Fortunately, I had one of the easiest jobs of all - looking after a conference group. Basically, for nine hours I waited for them to leave the room, at which point I would leap behind a table and pour coffee. Not particularly taxing on my brain (which was lucky), and the added bonus was that I got several good feeds. In fact, I'm getting very spoilt - I'm so used to eating five-star food that it's going to be a shock when I return to the endless pasta meals I used to cook for myself! On Friday, as if the day before hadn't been early enough, I had to start work at 6am. When I left my apartment it was still pitch black and several people were on their way home. The crazy thing, though, was that my bus was absolutely packed - far more so than in the afternoons! At least I got to see the varieties of people who were around Circular Quay (home of the Bridge and the Opera House) at that time of day. There were several men wielding large fishing rods, a couple of people huddled under blankets or coats sleeping on benches, and a large group sat around still drinking outside a 24-hour cafe, of which Sydney has plenty. I was overjoyed that my day's work was over and done by 10am, leaving me some free time. In the afternoon I met up with Sam, one of the other Netjetters. It was a gorgeous, hot afternoon, so a couple of drinks in a bar on Darling Harbour seemed like the best place to go to catch up. I found it quite strange to meet Sam after following him via the website whenever I got a chance. As he says in his report, we found a lot of our reactions to situations had been similar. It was nice to sit and have a beer and a chat with another traveller - and we both had many stories to tell.

Following months of speculation, the Sportsmasters Network has unveiled dates for its rival circuit next season, culminating in a world championship in Birmingham in April 2002. In many cases, especially for flagship events, the dates clash with the BBC's coverage of the official tour organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. It means the 2001 Embassy World Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield from April 21 will almost certainly be the last time all the sport's top stars will compete for one world crown. The BBC last week reiterated it would \"continue to fulfil its obligations\" under its snooker contract. But it is not yet clear what the corporation's position would be if the WPBSA could not fulfil its own contractual obligations in delivering top players. The sports body is understood to be required to deliver 13 of the top 16 snooker stars for tournaments covered by the BBC. Currently, TSN is claiming the support of 11 members of the top 16 snooker players and 23 of the top 32. If the BBC chose to remain with the established governing body, it would be gambling that its viewing figures would not be seriously affected by the absence of star names such as Mark Williams, Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Jimmy White. TSN has also been in talks with BBC for several months but, in the event of ultimate rejection, would seek to do deals with another broadcaster. The year-old internet company is backed by Warburg Pincus, the City venture capital firm that purchased a 20% stake for \u00a310million.

The electoral commission \u0096 set up last year in the wake of the Neill committee report into standards in public life \u0096 will for the first time put a cap on campaign spending wand place stringent rules on donations to the political parties. The binding framework of regulations comes after months of headlines about the funding of parties, including two donations of \u00a32m pounds to the Labour party from prominent peers and the largest ever single gift to a political party \u0096 a cheque for \u00a35m to the Tories from spreadbetting millionaire Stuart Wheeler. Now any donation of more than \u00a35,000 will have to be publicly declared, and anybody contributing more than \u00a3200 to a party will have to be on the UK electoral register. Companies that hand over money will have to be UK registered or an EU company carrying out business in Britain. This is a bid to end the accusations of sleaze aimed at foreign donors, such as the British-born but Belize-based Lord Ashcroft, who has bankrolled the Conservative party in the past. Labour has also had its own problems in the past \u0096 initially refusing to reveal Lord Hamlyn as the man behind a \u00a32m donation last year, and facing allegations of cash-for-favours after relaxing the rules on tobacco sponsorship following a \u00a31m gift from formula one chief Bernie Ecclestone. From the date the next general election is called \u0096 widely expected to follow Gordon Brown's budget on March 7 \u0096 the parties will have to account for their national spending, with a cap of \u00a315m. This contrasts with the 1997 election where both the two main parties spent around \u00a325m each on huge TV, press and billboard campaigns. The six-strong electoral commission \u0096 which is headed by Sam Younger, the former boss of the BBC world service \u0096 is also charged with keeping the register of political parties. The register currently stands at 114, from the main three national parties to special interest groups such as the Grey party, the Asian League and the No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party. Mr Younger said: \"The aim of the regulations which the commission will be responsible for implementing is to establish openness and transparency in the financial affairs of Britain's political parties.\" However, the commission has already faced criticism that it will be a watchdog without teeth, since it will only audit the accounts of the parties after any election. Mr Younger admitted: \"We are an investigatory body rather than a prosecuting one, but we are independent and answerable to parliament, and any recommendations we make will have the publicity to name and shame culprits.\" Spending limits for referendum campaigns mean only parties which receive more than 30% of the vote are allowed to spend the maximum \u00a35m on their campaigns.

It makes the point that if you don't register to vote, at an election, someone else will be speaking for you.</p> <p>\"Many people find voting by post more convenient. Previously you had to meet certain criteria in order to obtain a postal vote. The new rules mean anyone can vote by post, which is a great advance.

      "bodyText": "New moves aimed at boosting turnout at national and local elections by relaxing regulations on the electoral roll were announced today. Politicians from all parties have been horrified by turnouts as low as 16% in some local byelections and fears that a coming general election could see voter numbers fall to a postwar low. Now home office minister Mike O'Brien has given the go-ahead to a host of initiatives which could see voter registration forms included in mortgage packs for home buyers and polling stations in jails and mental hospitals. And people requiring a postal vote \u0096 such as travelling businessmen and the elderly or infirm \u0096 will now be registered for years at a time rather than having to reapply each time there is a local or national poll. For the first time there will be a \"rolling electoral roll\" allowing voters to sign up all year round, rather than the current anachronism which only permits registration in October for appearing on the roll the following February. However if there is a May 3 election, the deadline for putting your name on the roll will be March 12. The scheme will be backed by a huge \u00a33m TV and press advertising campaign featuring a young man in a nightclub and an elderly woman at home. The plan has cross-party support, with declarations of support from Tory home affairs spokesman John Bercow and Liberal Democrat Malcolm Bruce. Launching the campaign, Mr O'Brien said: \"The advertising campaign shows a person talking with a voice and opinions that are clearly not their own. It makes the point that if you don't register to vote, at an election, someone else will be speaking for you. \"Many people find voting by post more convenient. Previously you had to meet certain criteria in order to obtain a postal vote. The new rules mean anyone can vote by post, which is a great advance. People can register for a postal vote for a specific election or for a longer time period.\" Failure to register on the electoral roll, which is collated by local authorities, could result in a \u00a31,000 fine. However, prosecutions are usually only undertaken where failure to register has been wilful (in a bid to avoid paying council tax) or fraud has taken place.

But this we have done and more as public investment, halved under the Conservatives is now doubling under Labour.</p> <p>But for us these achievements mark not the end of our journey; these steps are just the beginning.</p> <p>As befits the Labour Party and our high ideals, our thoughts are not on the past but on the future.</p> <p>Not on achievements won but on long term goals we are determined to reach.</p> <p>And after four years of government under Tony Blair's leadership, I believe that we as a party gather here today more idealistic, more optimistic and more determined to implement in government our Labour values of justice and fairness.</p> <p>And we know that, as this generation of party members, a historic opportunity is granted to us: an opportunity never given to those at the end of the first term in the governments of 24, 29, 64, 74 and even 1945.</p> <p>For the first time as a government able to make the case for a second term with employment increasing; for the first time able to make the case for a second term with public investment rising; for the first time able to make the case from a foundation of stability.</p> <p>An unprecedented opportunity because having put the economic foundations in place, we are now, building with confidence, able to raise our sights to more ambitious and indeed more challenging goals that are our party's ideals and the next steps for Britain.</p> <p>As long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our work is not yet done.</p> <p>As long as rising prosperity bypasses a single community or a single family our work is not yet done.</p> <p>As long as there is opportunity denied in education or enterprise our work is not yet done.</p> <p>And as long as our public services need investment and modernisation our work is not yet done.</p> <p>And friends we can rededicate ourselves to the task ahead because the Labour party thanks to your efforts has never been stronger and I want to start by thanking all of you, our councillors in local government, our women's organisations, our young people's organisations, all elected representatives - for the work you do.</p> <p>But our starting point, Labour's starting point, indeed the precondition for progress, the foundation for our future, for rising living standards, is economic stability.</p> <p>Now in the past Labour governments have spent the first two years spending and because in 1966 and in 1976 they had not built the foundations for stability they were forced to retrench and cut back in their third and fourth years.</p> <p>I know that some people thought it was a mistake to take the tough approach to spending in our first two years. But we were right to put stability first.</p> <p>It was the tough decisions which we took, however unpopular, that have made it possible to keep interest rates low, to cut unemployment, cut child poverty by 1m and now to raise spending on the NHS, schools, policing and transport sustainably year on year.</p> <p>And I tell this conference as our manifesto for the next term will say that it is only by maintaining these tough disciplines and rejecting a return to the stop go quick fix short-termist indiscipline of the Tory years that we will rise to the challenges of a second term.</p> <p>And when the Tories now tell us that low inflation, low interest rates and low borrowing are nothing to do with the decisions of this government, let us ask them: if it was so easy to keep interest rates and inflation low why did Tory policies give us 15% interest rates, 11% inflation, a 50bn deficit and why did they repeatedly plunge Britain into boom and bust?</p> <p>We all know what this meant for the British people: unaffordable mortgage rates, mounting credit card debts, negative equity and even the threat of repossessions, for businesses, cuts in investments, fewer jobs, less in wages, greater insecurity.</p> <p>And we know what economic stability means for millions of British families around the country, including families like those with us today the Farnhams from Renfrewshire and the Beresfords from the North East of England - low interest rates, low inflation and rising living standards.</p> <p>It was not by chance but by choice, making the Bank of England independent and tough fiscal rules, not by accident but by our actions, that Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s, standards of living are rising, and instead of isolated in Europe we are winning for Britain in Europe.</p> <p>And let the country be in no doubt that if the Tories came back so too would Tory boom and bust. Because their free market short termist dogma would ensure a repeat of the very same mistakes - tax cuts they cannot afford, based on spending cuts they will not identify, a neglect of investment they cannot justify, based on the absence of any fiscal rules, all driven by short termist dogma, the all too familiar ingredients of traditional Tory boom and bust.</p> <p>So I can say today that the Budget will lock in the tough fiscal stance I set out in last year's Budget and pre-Budget report. Yes to responsible tax cuts where affordable - for families, pensioners, savings and investment. But there will be no return to the irresponsible pre-election give-aways of the past.</p> <p>And I say of the Budget and of a second term that unlike the Tories with their irresponsible, unfunded, unaffordable and unbelievable tax promises that simply do not add up but threaten boom and bust, nothing we do will put stability or essential public services at risk.</p> <p>So when it comes to the economic fundamentals and people ask what is the next step, I say in the first term we have put stability first. In the second term we will put stability first. Every term of a Labour government will put stability first.</p> <p>And the reason we put stability first, the reason I have always said our prudence is for a purpose, is that it is through achieving stability that we can reach higher in a radical second term of achievement for our country and meet five challenging economic goals that will be at the heart of our budget decisions and in our manifesto for the coming decade:</p> <p>- first to reach for full employment;</p> <p>- second prosperity for all by closing the productivity gap;</p> <p>- third the majority of the young going to college or university;</p> <p>- fourth ensuring not just some but all children have the best start in life as we eradicate child poverty; and</p> <p>- fifth meeting peoples rising expectations by delivering the best public services that everyone can rely on.</p> <p>Five radical economic goals for our generation, built on a foundation of stability and economic competence, all born out of our movement's central, driving ideal - that opportunity and security should not be just for a few but for all.</p> <p>First employment.</p> <p>I know the damage unemployment does.</p> <p>I remember my father telling me of working in this city in the 1930s in an era remembered for unemployed men standing on street corners when they wanted to work.</p> <p>I grew up in a mining area where once there were once 66 pits which closures by closure were reduced to just one.</p> <p>For me since the time I went to school and grew up around a mining community and for a whole generation our political life has been dominated by unemployment - long term unemployment, youth unemployment, the fear of unemployment, the consequences of unemployment, the poverty caused by unemployment.</p> <p>Since 1997, 1.1m jobs created, more people in work than ever before. But now is not the time for complacency or relaxing our efforts.</p> <p>And I tell this conference that in the coming election we will seek from the British people a mandate to create and then sustain full employment over the next decade. And not just in one region but all regions of our country.</p> <p>Already youth unemployment cut by over 75%, now the lowest since 1974. 500,000 on training or in work. But we are not satisfied. While stage one of our new deal was to link young people to the jobs, stage two is even bolder - to coach, encourage, train, motivate and yes to ask responsibility from those who are hard to employ who are still left behind but whom we need back to work both for them and because it is the best anti-deprivation, anti-crime, anti-vandalism, anti-poverty policy in our country.</p> <p>Long term unemployment cut by two thirds, now the lowest since the 1970s.</p> <p>But we are not satisfied.</p> <p>That is why the next stage in the next term is to match the unemployed without jobs to the skills shortages that need action and I call on employers to join us in sector by sector initiatives to meet skill shortages in IT, construction, retail, and financial services industries.</p> <p>Having raised lone parent employment from 44% to over 50%, we have yet more to do to reach our target of 70%. So in April, instead of the Tory policy of abolishing the New Deal for Lone Parents, I call on the whole country to support our new policy - training, interviews, advice and help for lone parents to find work - backed up by the doubling of investment from this year in our national child care strategy. The best and surest way of tackling child poverty in our country.</p> <p>And because the problems of our high unemployment areas will not be solved by benefit cheques or by property subsidies but require more enterprises and the opportunity for enterprise open to all, now and for the next Parliament I challenge every business leader to see our inner cities and old industrial estates not as no-go areas for business but as areas of huge untapped potential and consider investing and hiring unemployed men and women.</p> <p>In a new partnership for progress the next step is to ensure - as Labour will pledge itself at the election to do - that for people work pays.</p> <p>Our minimum wage, the historic achievement won not by the government but by your efforts, a statutory national minimum wage.</p> <p>And let us remember also, the minimum wage will never be safe under a Tory government.</p> <p>And as we examine the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission and improve the Working Families Tax Credit, we set a task for the next Parliament: we will continue to build a fairer tax system for the low paid, so that the principle of the WFTC that has made work pay for families with children will be extended to those without children too.</p> <p>And because education and skills are the key to opportunity and our economic future, the next election manifesto will seek also a new ambitious mandate to remove the old barriers to educational opportunity and access to colleges and universities.</p> <p>The reason I, like David Blunkett, am concerned not just about nursery education and standards in the schools but higher staying on rates and wider access to college and university, is that I remember my school classes of the 1960s when it was for only a fraction of young people that a university place was available.</p> <p>It was a scandal of wasted potential. And I see today that there are still thousands of young people who have the ability and should have the chances that I and others were able to enjoy.</p> <p>It was a scandal of wasted potential then and it is still a scandal now.</p> <p>So in the interests of the country's economy as well as individual students, it is time to take the next step so that not just a minority have access to higher and further education but for the first time a majority - and we will do so not by quotas but by investing in educational maintenance allowances worth up to \u00a330 a week for staying on at school, and through summer schools and opening up recruitment, widening access so that our colleges and universities can draw on the widest possible pool of talent.</p> <p>We want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to but the potential you were born with.</p> <p>But our hard won and newly won stability allows us to set an even more challenging goal.</p> <p>Child poverty is a scar on the soul of Britain. Children two or three years old, for whom, without action, we know life never will be fair, destined to fail even before their lives journey has begun and whom it is our duty to help. Child benefit already up 30 per cent.</p> <p>Under the Tories, child benefit, \u00a311 a week. Under Labour, child benefit and the new children's tax credit, \u00a324 a week , twice as much, and for some, \u00a350 a week.</p> <p>1m children taken out of poverty but that is only the start.</p> <p>Our next reform: an integrated child credit, a seamless system of family support, built on universal child benefit.</p> <p>So we will seek a very specific mandate from the people of this country to take the next million children out of poverty, to halve child poverty by 2010 and abolish it in a generation.</p> <p>But let us be clear about the new thinking for the next term because we need care as well as cash, the war against child poverty cannot be won by government national and local alone, only by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable, community and public sectors working together.</p> <p>So in the next Parliament as we expand Sure Start, support community initiatives with the children's fund, toughen up the responsibilities we demand of absent parents, and encourage a new alliance for children, let us make it our mission in every community of our country - as councillors, party members, concerned parents - to bring together and mobilise all the forces of care and compassion so that in this country in our generation we end the shame of child poverty and ensure that no child is left behind, every child the best possible start in life. And our hard won stability is the foundation for achieving another historic Labour goal - to abolish pensioner poverty and ensure every elderly citizen enjoys a rising share in the standard of living of our country.</p> <p>When we came to power our first priority was to tackle pensioner poverty - persistent disabling often hidden poverty especially amongst widows over 75 whose husband had left little or no occupational pension, who had no savings but who under the Tories had only \u00a371 a week to live on, but from April as a result of the priority agreed for tackling pensioner poverty will have \u00a392 a week and then \u00a3100 a week, nearly half as much again as in 1997.</p> <p>And because we must be the voice for those weakest, frailest and most vulnerable citizens who are often least able to use their voice, let us tell the country that it was right - and is right - to take the poorest pensioners out of poverty first.</p> <p>And now having made this start, we propose the next step for the next parliament - to raise the incomes of middle and low income pensioners.</p> <p>Building on the winter allowance, free TV licences for the over 75s, raising the basic pension by \u00a35 and \u00a38, let us tell the country about our new pension credit, a tax and benefit reform that for middle and low income pensioners - for couples with pension incomes of \u00a310,000 or less - will reward saving and ensure higher incomes than they would receive even from an earnings link.</p> <p>And let us tell the country also of the Tories' plans.</p> <p>Even in their disarray over pensions, the same Tory party that did nothing for 20 years about pensioner poverty, still want to abolish the winter allowance, remove free TV licenses and even scrap the Christmas bonus. And we must make it our cause that this should never happen.</p> <p>Let us tell every pensioner in the country of our next steps - a guarantee for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty; for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them; and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country.</p> <p>And let our next step be to build from our new found and hard won stability not just the most basic services, but build over this generation the best public services, services that we can be proud of.</p> <p>Let me be clear - every opportunity we have had - the best schooling, the best of health care when ill, for many of us the best chances at university, - every opportunity we have enjoyed owes its origin to the decisions of past Labour governments, decisions we made as a Labour party to expand education from the few to the many, to create a welfare state that takes the shame out of need and to fund a National Health Service open to all.</p> <p>And it is only because some people have forgotten the chaos, the unreliable pre war voluntary, charitable and private provision that they can contemplate a return to privatised health and basic services.</p> <p>Friends let us tell the country that the contrast between Labour and the Conservatives is starker than it has ever been.</p> <p>It is between Labour who wants to invest, modernise and reform the public services - doubling public investment: education spending rising at 5% a year; health spending at 6% a year; and a 50% rise in transport spending over the coming four years. And the Tories who want to privatise, break up and fragment them.</p> <p>And in this battle over the future of public services, we will ask people to reject the Tory way of cutting public investment and spending and undermining our public services and instead ask for a mandate for the New Labour way, investing more in return for clear output targets and delivery.</p> <p>It is by departments realising they should devolve downwards to a local level and by local government securing flexibility and finance in return for reform and results that we will do best.</p> <p>In our first term we had to set a new national framework, a national framework for stability, employment and public services and tax.</p> <p>In the second term to achieve our goals, full employment, better public services and ending child poverty, we need to devolve power from the centre to regions and local communities.</p> <p>So over the next two years the number of local Public Service Agreements matching resources to output targets signed with local authorities will rise from 20 to 150 and just as for the Regional Development Agencies we have granted more flexibility with more finance, so too with local government we will match that with further steps towards greater flexibility: flexibility in return for reform and resources.</p> <p>I want people to see what we do together as a Labour commitment to the renaissance of local government in our country.</p> <p>So ours is a battle to demonstrate that in the 21st century, we can build strong modern locally run public services that people can rely on. And to win that battle, we must defeat not just political conservatism, but another form of conservatism - and more insidious - cynicism. Reading every day the Tory press releases they are not really trying to win voters' approval they are simply trying to win voters' apathy.</p> <p>The cynics who try to make people believe that governments can never make a difference, that all politicians are just out for themselves, that the only form of public service is self service, that politics never be a force for good.</p> <p>When they say governments always fail and that governments can do no good, their aim is to subvert the decent, progressive instincts of the British people and to defeat the very idea of a progressive public purpose.</p> <p>But to those cynical about public service and public action let us tell them that there are great causes both at home, and all across the world that are worth fighting for. Tomorrow at the G7 meeting of Finance Ministers we will discuss the next steps in the campaign that Clare Short has led - our duties as industrial countries to lift the crippling burden of third world debt.</p> <p>In building a virtuous circle of debt relief poverty reduction and sustainable development, let us set and meet challenging targets for the year 2015.</p> <p>Instead of one child in every seven dying before the age of five, calling on the pharmaceutical companies and all governments to join us in widening access to life saving drugs and health care and eradicating avoidable infant deaths. Instead of 120m children denied education every child in primary education.</p> <p>Instead of 1 billion condemned to poverty halving poverty by 2015.</p> <p>And to speed up this process, we will ask the IMF, the World Bank the developed countries and developing countries, churches, charities, companies to forge a plan so that targets set are targets met, goals agreed are goals achieved.</p> <p>And I can tell you today that to lead that goal so that no child is left behind, every child a decent start in life, at our international children's conference on February 26th, Nelson Mandela will inaugurate this new global initiative, worthy of both a second term and our values.</p> <p>Let us answer the cynics by our actions, showing that when governments intervene to tackle injustice they are not violating rights, they are righting wrongs.</p> <p>Let us show that Labour exists not for itself but for larger and noble purposes - what we can achieve for this country and one world.</p> <p>Let us tell the country why we are New Labour, not just by upbringing and custom, but by conviction and belief.</p> <p>We are Labour because we believe that we are not simply self interested individuals, isolated and sufficient unto ourselves, Labour because we are men and women who feel, however distantly, the pain of others, who believe in something bigger than ourselves.</p> <p>Citizens with mutual needs, linked destinies and - yes - shared values, who in Robert Kennedy's words, see suffering and seek to heal it, see pain and seek to end it, see injustice and seek to overcome it, see prejudice and seek to triumph over it.</p> <p>Let us tell the people that it is when politics fail and governments walk away that children are malnourished and too many more are undereducated, that men and women go without jobs and many others are never able to move ahead, that pensioners die in poverty and too many struggle month after month to make ends meet, that public squalor exists alongside private affluence and potential is left unrealized.</p> <p>It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that all can begin to have opportunity and no one is left out. It is when politics succeed and governments engage that all our people have the chance to make the most of themselves and no one and no area is excluded.</p> <p>It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that economic growth and economic justice advance together and rising growth will deliver rising living standards for all.</p> <p>People say Labour's great moment was in the past, in 1945.</p> <p>Others say our great modern triumph was May 1997.</p> <p>But I say again, we have only just begun.</p> <p>And to those same people who say Labour's place in history is assured by winning a second term, I say, it is victory with a mandate Labour seeks.</p> <p>Let us pledge that for our generation our Party's place in history will be measured not just in votes, seats or majorities but in better lives for people who may never know us but whose security and opportunities will as a result of our common endeavour be transformed.</p> <p>Let us have confidence that this great Party, whose roots are in the past but whose faith is in the future, can meet new needs, tackle the great injustices, open up new opportunities and give new life to people's hopes.</p> <p>Let us be the generation that abolished child and pensioner poverty built modern public services, created full employment and took the next steps to prosperity for all.</p> <p>Causes worth fighting for.</p> <p>Let us seize our opportunity</p> <p>And let us use it well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Friends, we meet here in Glasgow in a week that we have seen unemployment fall to its lowest level for twenty five years; inflation down to its lowest level for thirty years; long term interest rates down to their lowest level for thirty five years; mortgage payments, lower under Labour, \u00a31000 lower under Labour than under the Tories. Instead of the miseries of boom and bust which wrecked people's lives under the Tories, with Labour: the confidence in 2001 of economic stability within which businesses and hard working families can plan ahead. And more than 1m men and women denied work under the Tories now in jobs under Labour. With stability Labour now the natural party of economic competence in Britain, just as with our minimum wage, 1m children out of poverty, rising pensioners incomes we are the natural party in government of social justice too. Friends, they said of us here that in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, 1m jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales, legislate a minimum wage, give a statutory right to trade union membership and recognition and take a million children out of poverty. But this we have done and more as public investment, halved under the Conservatives is now doubling under Labour. But for us these achievements mark not the end of our journey; these steps are just the beginning. As befits the Labour Party and our high ideals, our thoughts are not on the past but on the future. Not on achievements won but on long term goals we are determined to reach. And after four years of government under Tony Blair's leadership, I believe that we as a party gather here today more idealistic, more optimistic and more determined to implement in government our Labour values of justice and fairness. And we know that, as this generation of party members, a historic opportunity is granted to us: an opportunity never given to those at the end of the first term in the governments of 24, 29, 64, 74 and even 1945. For the first time as a government able to make the case for a second term with employment increasing; for the first time able to make the case for a second term with public investment rising; for the first time able to make the case from a foundation of stability. An unprecedented opportunity because having put the economic foundations in place, we are now, building with confidence, able to raise our sights to more ambitious and indeed more challenging goals that are our party's ideals and the next steps for Britain. As long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our work is not yet done. As long as rising prosperity bypasses a single community or a single family our work is not yet done. As long as there is opportunity denied in education or enterprise our work is not yet done. And as long as our public services need investment and modernisation our work is not yet done. And friends we can rededicate ourselves to the task ahead because the Labour party thanks to your efforts has never been stronger and I want to start by thanking all of you, our councillors in local government, our women's organisations, our young people's organisations, all elected representatives - for the work you do. But our starting point, Labour's starting point, indeed the precondition for progress, the foundation for our future, for rising living standards, is economic stability. Now in the past Labour governments have spent the first two years spending and because in 1966 and in 1976 they had not built the foundations for stability they were forced to retrench and cut back in their third and fourth years. I know that some people thought it was a mistake to take the tough approach to spending in our first two years. But we were right to put stability first. It was the tough decisions which we took, however unpopular, that have made it possible to keep interest rates low, to cut unemployment, cut child poverty by 1m and now to raise spending on the NHS, schools, policing and transport sustainably year on year. And I tell this conference as our manifesto for the next term will say that it is only by maintaining these tough disciplines and rejecting a return to the stop go quick fix short-termist indiscipline of the Tory years that we will rise to the challenges of a second term. And when the Tories now tell us that low inflation, low interest rates and low borrowing are nothing to do with the decisions of this government, let us ask them: if it was so easy to keep interest rates and inflation low why did Tory policies give us 15% interest rates, 11% inflation, a 50bn deficit and why did they repeatedly plunge Britain into boom and bust? We all know what this meant for the British people: unaffordable mortgage rates, mounting credit card debts, negative equity and even the threat of repossessions, for businesses, cuts in investments, fewer jobs, less in wages, greater insecurity. And we know what economic stability means for millions of British families around the country, including families like those with us today the Farnhams from Renfrewshire and the Beresfords from the North East of England - low interest rates, low inflation and rising living standards. It was not by chance but by choice, making the Bank of England independent and tough fiscal rules, not by accident but by our actions, that Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s, standards of living are rising, and instead of isolated in Europe we are winning for Britain in Europe. And let the country be in no doubt that if the Tories came back so too would Tory boom and bust. Because their free market short termist dogma would ensure a repeat of the very same mistakes - tax cuts they cannot afford, based on spending cuts they will not identify, a neglect of investment they cannot justify, based on the absence of any fiscal rules, all driven by short termist dogma, the all too familiar ingredients of traditional Tory boom and bust. So I can say today that the Budget will lock in the tough fiscal stance I set out in last year's Budget and pre-Budget report. Yes to responsible tax cuts where affordable - for families, pensioners, savings and investment. But there will be no return to the irresponsible pre-election give-aways of the past. And I say of the Budget and of a second term that unlike the Tories with their irresponsible, unfunded, unaffordable and unbelievable tax promises that simply do not add up but threaten boom and bust, nothing we do will put stability or essential public services at risk. So when it comes to the economic fundamentals and people ask what is the next step, I say in the first term we have put stability first. In the second term we will put stability first. Every term of a Labour government will put stability first. And the reason we put stability first, the reason I have always said our prudence is for a purpose, is that it is through achieving stability that we can reach higher in a radical second term of achievement for our country and meet five challenging economic goals that will be at the heart of our budget decisions and in our manifesto for the coming decade: - first to reach for full employment; - second prosperity for all by closing the productivity gap; - third the majority of the young going to college or university; - fourth ensuring not just some but all children have the best start in life as we eradicate child poverty; and - fifth meeting peoples rising expectations by delivering the best public services that everyone can rely on. Five radical economic goals for our generation, built on a foundation of stability and economic competence, all born out of our movement's central, driving ideal - that opportunity and security should not be just for a few but for all. First employment. I know the damage unemployment does. I remember my father telling me of working in this city in the 1930s in an era remembered for unemployed men standing on street corners when they wanted to work. I grew up in a mining area where once there were once 66 pits which closures by closure were reduced to just one. For me since the time I went to school and grew up around a mining community and for a whole generation our political life has been dominated by unemployment - long term unemployment, youth unemployment, the fear of unemployment, the consequences of unemployment, the poverty caused by unemployment. Since 1997, 1.1m jobs created, more people in work than ever before. But now is not the time for complacency or relaxing our efforts. And I tell this conference that in the coming election we will seek from the British people a mandate to create and then sustain full employment over the next decade. And not just in one region but all regions of our country. Already youth unemployment cut by over 75%, now the lowest since 1974. 500,000 on training or in work. But we are not satisfied. While stage one of our new deal was to link young people to the jobs, stage two is even bolder - to coach, encourage, train, motivate and yes to ask responsibility from those who are hard to employ who are still left behind but whom we need back to work both for them and because it is the best anti-deprivation, anti-crime, anti-vandalism, anti-poverty policy in our country. Long term unemployment cut by two thirds, now the lowest since the 1970s. But we are not satisfied. That is why the next stage in the next term is to match the unemployed without jobs to the skills shortages that need action and I call on employers to join us in sector by sector initiatives to meet skill shortages in IT, construction, retail, and financial services industries. Having raised lone parent employment from 44% to over 50%, we have yet more to do to reach our target of 70%. So in April, instead of the Tory policy of abolishing the New Deal for Lone Parents, I call on the whole country to support our new policy - training, interviews, advice and help for lone parents to find work - backed up by the doubling of investment from this year in our national child care strategy. The best and surest way of tackling child poverty in our country. And because the problems of our high unemployment areas will not be solved by benefit cheques or by property subsidies but require more enterprises and the opportunity for enterprise open to all, now and for the next Parliament I challenge every business leader to see our inner cities and old industrial estates not as no-go areas for business but as areas of huge untapped potential and consider investing and hiring unemployed men and women. In a new partnership for progress the next step is to ensure - as Labour will pledge itself at the election to do - that for people work pays. Our minimum wage, the historic achievement won not by the government but by your efforts, a statutory national minimum wage. And let us remember also, the minimum wage will never be safe under a Tory government. And as we examine the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission and improve the Working Families Tax Credit, we set a task for the next Parliament: we will continue to build a fairer tax system for the low paid, so that the principle of the WFTC that has made work pay for families with children will be extended to those without children too. And because education and skills are the key to opportunity and our economic future, the next election manifesto will seek also a new ambitious mandate to remove the old barriers to educational opportunity and access to colleges and universities. The reason I, like David Blunkett, am concerned not just about nursery education and standards in the schools but higher staying on rates and wider access to college and university, is that I remember my school classes of the 1960s when it was for only a fraction of young people that a university place was available. It was a scandal of wasted potential. And I see today that there are still thousands of young people who have the ability and should have the chances that I and others were able to enjoy. It was a scandal of wasted potential then and it is still a scandal now. So in the interests of the country's economy as well as individual students, it is time to take the next step so that not just a minority have access to higher and further education but for the first time a majority - and we will do so not by quotas but by investing in educational maintenance allowances worth up to \u00a330 a week for staying on at school, and through summer schools and opening up recruitment, widening access so that our colleges and universities can draw on the widest possible pool of talent. We want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to but the potential you were born with. But our hard won and newly won stability allows us to set an even more challenging goal. Child poverty is a scar on the soul of Britain. Children two or three years old, for whom, without action, we know life never will be fair, destined to fail even before their lives journey has begun and whom it is our duty to help. Child benefit already up 30 per cent. Under the Tories, child benefit, \u00a311 a week. Under Labour, child benefit and the new children's tax credit, \u00a324 a week , twice as much, and for some, \u00a350 a week. 1m children taken out of poverty but that is only the start. Our next reform: an integrated child credit, a seamless system of family support, built on universal child benefit. So we will seek a very specific mandate from the people of this country to take the next million children out of poverty, to halve child poverty by 2010 and abolish it in a generation. But let us be clear about the new thinking for the next term because we need care as well as cash, the war against child poverty cannot be won by government national and local alone, only by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable, community and public sectors working together. So in the next Parliament as we expand Sure Start, support community initiatives with the children's fund, toughen up the responsibilities we demand of absent parents, and encourage a new alliance for children, let us make it our mission in every community of our country - as councillors, party members, concerned parents - to bring together and mobilise all the forces of care and compassion so that in this country in our generation we end the shame of child poverty and ensure that no child is left behind, every child the best possible start in life. And our hard won stability is the foundation for achieving another historic Labour goal - to abolish pensioner poverty and ensure every elderly citizen enjoys a rising share in the standard of living of our country. When we came to power our first priority was to tackle pensioner poverty - persistent disabling often hidden poverty especially amongst widows over 75 whose husband had left little or no occupational pension, who had no savings but who under the Tories had only \u00a371 a week to live on, but from April as a result of the priority agreed for tackling pensioner poverty will have \u00a392 a week and then \u00a3100 a week, nearly half as much again as in 1997. And because we must be the voice for those weakest, frailest and most vulnerable citizens who are often least able to use their voice, let us tell the country that it was right - and is right - to take the poorest pensioners out of poverty first. And now having made this start, we propose the next step for the next parliament - to raise the incomes of middle and low income pensioners. Building on the winter allowance, free TV licences for the over 75s, raising the basic pension by \u00a35 and \u00a38, let us tell the country about our new pension credit, a tax and benefit reform that for middle and low income pensioners - for couples with pension incomes of \u00a310,000 or less - will reward saving and ensure higher incomes than they would receive even from an earnings link. And let us tell the country also of the Tories' plans. Even in their disarray over pensions, the same Tory party that did nothing for 20 years about pensioner poverty, still want to abolish the winter allowance, remove free TV licenses and even scrap the Christmas bonus. And we must make it our cause that this should never happen. Let us tell every pensioner in the country of our next steps - a guarantee for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty; for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them; and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country. And let our next step be to build from our new found and hard won stability not just the most basic services, but build over this generation the best public services, services that we can be proud of. Let me be clear - every opportunity we have had - the best schooling, the best of health care when ill, for many of us the best chances at university, - every opportunity we have enjoyed owes its origin to the decisions of past Labour governments, decisions we made as a Labour party to expand education from the few to the many, to create a welfare state that takes the shame out of need and to fund a National Health Service open to all. And it is only because some people have forgotten the chaos, the unreliable pre war voluntary, charitable and private provision that they can contemplate a return to privatised health and basic services. Friends let us tell the country that the contrast between Labour and the Conservatives is starker than it has ever been. It is between Labour who wants to invest, modernise and reform the public services - doubling public investment: education spending rising at 5% a year; health spending at 6% a year; and a 50% rise in transport spending over the coming four years. And the Tories who want to privatise, break up and fragment them. And in this battle over the future of public services, we will ask people to reject the Tory way of cutting public investment and spending and undermining our public services and instead ask for a mandate for the New Labour way, investing more in return for clear output targets and delivery. It is by departments realising they should devolve downwards to a local level and by local government securing flexibility and finance in return for reform and results that we will do best. In our first term we had to set a new national framework, a national framework for stability, employment and public services and tax. In the second term to achieve our goals, full employment, better public services and ending child poverty, we need to devolve power from the centre to regions and local communities. So over the next two years the number of local Public Service Agreements matching resources to output targets signed with local authorities will rise from 20 to 150 and just as for the Regional Development Agencies we have granted more flexibility with more finance, so too with local government we will match that with further steps towards greater flexibility: flexibility in return for reform and resources. I want people to see what we do together as a Labour commitment to the renaissance of local government in our country. So ours is a battle to demonstrate that in the 21st century, we can build strong modern locally run public services that people can rely on. And to win that battle, we must defeat not just political conservatism, but another form of conservatism - and more insidious - cynicism. Reading every day the Tory press releases they are not really trying to win voters' approval they are simply trying to win voters' apathy. The cynics who try to make people believe that governments can never make a difference, that all politicians are just out for themselves, that the only form of public service is self service, that politics never be a force for good. When they say governments always fail and that governments can do no good, their aim is to subvert the decent, progressive instincts of the British people and to defeat the very idea of a progressive public purpose. But to those cynical about public service and public action let us tell them that there are great causes both at home, and all across the world that are worth fighting for. Tomorrow at the G7 meeting of Finance Ministers we will discuss the next steps in the campaign that Clare Short has led - our duties as industrial countries to lift the crippling burden of third world debt. In building a virtuous circle of debt relief poverty reduction and sustainable development, let us set and meet challenging targets for the year 2015. Instead of one child in every seven dying before the age of five, calling on the pharmaceutical companies and all governments to join us in widening access to life saving drugs and health care and eradicating avoidable infant deaths. Instead of 120m children denied education every child in primary education. Instead of 1 billion condemned to poverty halving poverty by 2015. And to speed up this process, we will ask the IMF, the World Bank the developed countries and developing countries, churches, charities, companies to forge a plan so that targets set are targets met, goals agreed are goals achieved. And I can tell you today that to lead that goal so that no child is left behind, every child a decent start in life, at our international children's conference on February 26th, Nelson Mandela will inaugurate this new global initiative, worthy of both a second term and our values. Let us answer the cynics by our actions, showing that when governments intervene to tackle injustice they are not violating rights, they are righting wrongs. Let us show that Labour exists not for itself but for larger and noble purposes - what we can achieve for this country and one world. Let us tell the country why we are New Labour, not just by upbringing and custom, but by conviction and belief. We are Labour because we believe that we are not simply self interested individuals, isolated and sufficient unto ourselves, Labour because we are men and women who feel, however distantly, the pain of others, who believe in something bigger than ourselves. Citizens with mutual needs, linked destinies and - yes - shared values, who in Robert Kennedy's words, see suffering and seek to heal it, see pain and seek to end it, see injustice and seek to overcome it, see prejudice and seek to triumph over it. Let us tell the people that it is when politics fail and governments walk away that children are malnourished and too many more are undereducated, that men and women go without jobs and many others are never able to move ahead, that pensioners die in poverty and too many struggle month after month to make ends meet, that public squalor exists alongside private affluence and potential is left unrealized. It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that all can begin to have opportunity and no one is left out. It is when politics succeed and governments engage that all our people have the chance to make the most of themselves and no one and no area is excluded. It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that economic growth and economic justice advance together and rising growth will deliver rising living standards for all. People say Labour's great moment was in the past, in 1945. Others say our great modern triumph was May 1997. But I say again, we have only just begun. And to those same people who say Labour's place in history is assured by winning a second term, I say, it is victory with a mandate Labour seeks. Let us pledge that for our generation our Party's place in history will be measured not just in votes, seats or majorities but in better lives for people who may never know us but whose security and opportunities will as a result of our common endeavour be transformed. Let us have confidence that this great Party, whose roots are in the past but whose faith is in the future, can meet new needs, tackle the great injustices, open up new opportunities and give new life to people's hopes. Let us be the generation that abolished child and pensioner poverty built modern public services, created full employment and took the next steps to prosperity for all. Causes worth fighting for. Let us seize our opportunity And let us use it well.",

We won't know until we try, and, unless we try, we will never know. Gordon Brown should continue his gradualist policy of nudging unemployment down until it can realistically go down no further.

Shortlisted titles include White Teeth by Zadie Smith in the New Talent category, the second volume of Ian Kershaw's Hitler biography, and Marrying the Mistress by Joanna Trollope for the Fiction prize. There's a strong shortlist in the bizarrely named 'General Knowledge' category (how to decide between Peter Ackroyd's monumental London and David Bodanis's E=MC2?), while Prince Charles has been nominated in the Home and Leisure section. Each of the winners will receive \u00a35,000 in prize money.</p> <p>And now it's up to you.

If you don't like any of the books on the shortlists, you can nominate new titles. The titles with the most votes will win.</p> <p>However, while the great unwashed are allowed to air their views on Joanna Trollope and Maeve Binchy in the Fiction Award, the ninth \"literary\" prize will remain the preserve of the critics.

      "bodyText": "In what WH Smith describes as a \"radical approach to book prizes\", members of the public will vote for the winners of the first WH Smith Book Awards. The longlists for the eight new categories were compiled by panels of experts, customers and celebrities. Shortlisted titles include White Teeth by Zadie Smith in the New Talent category, the second volume of Ian Kershaw's Hitler biography, and Marrying the Mistress by Joanna Trollope for the Fiction prize. There's a strong shortlist in the bizarrely named 'General Knowledge' category (how to decide between Peter Ackroyd's monumental London and David Bodanis's E=MC2?), while Prince Charles has been nominated in the Home and Leisure section. Each of the winners will receive \u00a35,000 in prize money. And now it's up to you. You can vote for your chosen books online, by post or at any branch of WH Smith. If you don't like any of the books on the shortlists, you can nominate new titles. The titles with the most votes will win. However, while the great unwashed are allowed to air their views on Joanna Trollope and Maeve Binchy in the Fiction Award, the ninth \"literary\" prize will remain the preserve of the critics. The judging panel for the WHSmith Literary Award, now in its 43rd year, includes the academic John Carey, writer and critic Lucy Hughes-Hallett and journalist and broadcaster Mark Lawson.

The Tower Hamlets delegation will fly to Cape Town and Durban.</p> <p>Mr Asmal added that although the South African government was not opposed to the rights of teachers to take up posts abroad, it would have been appropriate for British education authorities to contact his ministry first, given that recruitment was for state schools.</p> <p>\"A government-to-government consultation would have ensured that the best interests of both countries could be discussed and an arrangement worked out in which both countries could benefit,\" he said.</p> <p>The Department for Education said last night: \"The government does not recruit teachers either here or abroad. But Mr Blunkett is happy to talk to Mr Asmal to clarify any of these issues.</p> <p>\"Supply teacher agencies in the private sector may recruit from overseas although we don't encourage it in developing nations where there is likely to be an adverse effect on the economy. That said, South African and other Commonwealth teachers who do choose to come to London schools make an important contribution to those schools and are well qualified.\"</p> <p>TimePlan's managing director, Ian Penman, said his company was not plundering the country's teaching stock because there were more teachers than jobs available in South Africa, while those that go to the UK enhanced their professional development by returning with extra skills.</p>",

In a green paper on education launched by the prime minister on Monday, the government set out new measures to recruit and retain teachers, including writing off the student loans of graduates who enter the profession. The two separate London schools delegations are being sent to South Africa next week by a British recruitment agency, TimePlan, which is also covering the \u00a330,000 cost. It said a similar exercise last year was very successful, with more than 30 teachers recruited for Newham at salaries of four times what they would get back home. This time the Newham group will travel to Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth. The Tower Hamlets delegation will fly to Cape Town and Durban. Mr Asmal added that although the South African government was not opposed to the rights of teachers to take up posts abroad, it would have been appropriate for British education authorities to contact his ministry first, given that recruitment was for state schools. \"A government-to-government consultation would have ensured that the best interests of both countries could be discussed and an arrangement worked out in which both countries could benefit,\" he said. The Department for Education said last night: \"The government does not recruit teachers either here or abroad. But Mr Blunkett is happy to talk to Mr Asmal to clarify any of these issues. \"Supply teacher agencies in the private sector may recruit from overseas although we don't encourage it in developing nations where there is likely to be an adverse effect on the economy. That said, South African and other Commonwealth teachers who do choose to come to London schools make an important contribution to those schools and are well qualified.\" TimePlan's managing director, Ian Penman, said his company was not plundering the country's teaching stock because there were more teachers than jobs available in South Africa, while those that go to the UK enhanced their professional development by returning with extra skills.",

It is owned by her father, Rick Hilton, and is the prize property of the family-run Hilton chain. Clearly, if you can call such a building home, your outlook on the world is going to be a little different from that of the average person. </p> <p>Paris has had a rough ride these past few months, sparked by an article in last September's Vanity Fair. The piece highlighted her colourful nightlife behaviour as New York's leading It Girl, along with her sister, Nicky, who is 17. This fashion week, she has been one of the biggest stars, off and on the catwalk, and now her fame is about to extend beyond the social columns of the New York tabloids. Paris has just completed her first ad campaign for Italian label Iceberg, which is starting to appear in magazines worldwide. </p> <p>When Paris gets to the hotel, she sweeps up to the Hilton's private floor. She takes off her sweater to reveal a tiny \"Playboy\" vest and sits down in the huge lounge. In walks Nicky. </p> <p>\"Can I have my necklace?\" the younger sister says. \"Which one?\" Paris replies. \"The one with the lightning bolt.\" Paris looks at her wearily and says she'll get it later. Nicky storms off. \"She's such a bitch,\" Paris says quietly. </p> <p>It's been a busy week for Paris and Nicky. The sisters have been pleasing the paparazzi on the front row at all the major celebrity shows, including Diane Von Furstenberg and Sean John. Paris has also modelled at a few others, such as Catherine Malandrino. She gets out her modelling book with gusto - she's signed to Donald Trump's agency, T Management. </p> <p>\"I've been modelling since I was really young,\" she explains. \"I did charity shows with my mother as a child.\" This was when the family lived in Los Angeles. They upped sticks and moved coast when Paris was 15. She joined the agency last summer. \"I wanted to model and Donald was like: 'I want you at my agency.' So now I'm with them and I'm loving it.\" </p> <p>Her book mostly contains pictures from articles about her family. There's one she hates from American Vogue, where the female Hiltons are made to look haughty. There's the infamous David La Chapelle topless shoot that went with the Vanity Fair article, and the Iceberg ads, also shot by La Chapelle. How did this job, her most prestigious so far, come about? </p> <p>\"Basically, the girl that was meant to shoot the campaign lied about her size,\" Paris claims. \"I was meant to be in a shot with Oscar [de la Hoya, the boxer, who Paris was allegedly seeing while her then boyfriend, Terminator 2 star Eddie Furlong, was in rehab] but then, they were like: 'What are we going to do? We've got all these size four clothes and this girl is like a size twelve.' \" Paris stepped into the unfortunate model's shoes and got her own solo slot. </p> <p>Nicky walks in again, still looking for her necklace. Then her mother, Kathy, shouts from elsewhere in the apartment. \"Paris!\" she yells. \"You gotta get ready. You've got front row seats.\" </p> <p>It's twenty minutes before the start of the show by society designers Badgley Mischka. \"Sorry,\" says Paris, embarrassed. \"It's my mom.\" And she's off, to get ready for another very public appearance. </p> <p>Paris is on the phone again a couple of days later. It's her 20th birthday party tomorrow, but it's already been a hot topic of discussion in the New York papers all week. \"It's exciting,\" she says, on the way to another modelling job. \"I'm no longer going to be a teenager. Time to grow up, I guess.\" </p> <p> The event, at a club called Eugene's, is reportedly being backed by Playboy, but Paris says this isn't true. \"They're not sponsoring it. My friend I'm sharing the party with [Jonathan Cheban] does the publicity for all the Playboy events. And my friend's dad does Playboy jewellery, and everyone will get given a necklace.\" </p> <p>Isn't she nervous about it? \"No, not really.\" She sounds distinctly unfazed. \"I hate that it's in the paper because everyone knows we're having the party and I don't want to offend anyone. But it can't take everyone.\" What's the capacity? \"Five hundred,\" she says, \"but I'm sure it'll be like a thousand.\" </p> <p>What does she think about being an heiress? \"I think it's retarded,\" she says. \"They call me Paris the Heiress. I was going to go to school to study hotel management, but I don't want to be behind a hotel desk. My sister, she's really into all that. I'm more of an artsy person. I'm getting ready to record my album, I have my modelling and acting.\" </p> <p>Then Paris has a question of her own. \"Is this going to be a good article or is it going to trash me?\" </p> <p>How many interviews have trashed you? \"Every single article has trashed me,\" she replies. \"I don't get it. Just because I'm born with some name - I'm just a teenager living my life.\" </p> <p>The problem for Paris is that it's a matter of perception. Because this life seems normal to her (\"I wake up in the morning and I work\"), she cannot see that to most of the world her circumstances are exquisitely incomprehensible. Her situation is incredibly enviable, since who wouldn't swap an adolescence of angst for one of great parties and unflinching self-confidence? But there has to be a downside to everything and with Paris it is that this sassy girl will always appear to be a nasty piece of work. But you get the feeling other people's opinions haven't mattered before and they won't again. Paris Hilton will always get along just fine.</p>",

Finally it seems that the department of health has produced its most positive contribution to the public health debate. Ms Cooper is doing something politicians rarely manage - which is to lead by example. Even Tony Blair's fudged paternity leave after the arrival of baby Leo - taking things easy for a couple of weeks while refusing to let John Prescott actually take the reins of power - smacked of a Third Way that hardly put the new baby or its mother first. Despite enormous improvements in maternity benefits, there is still a lingering suggestion that women who either choose between career and family or who squeeze out babies between meetings and pretend nothing has happened are somehow better employees. Acres of newsprint were devoted to the case of Sue Clark, director of corporate affairs at Scottish Power, when, two years ago, she stayed at her desk during labour and was able, via the magic of teleconferencing, to complete a deal within two days of her baby being born. For those of us returning from a leisurely maternity leave - even longer than Ms Cooper's - this example is enough to make the blood run cold. The incessant crying, insecurity and constant need for food which follow childbirth makes it impossible for most of us to contemplate returning to work within four or five months. And that is even before one takes into account the needs of the baby. In Ms Clark's case she planned only eight weeks off - barely time to establish a routine for a newborn - but the company's feelings were quite clear. \"Everyone in the company appreciates Sue's determination,\" a Scottish Power spokesman purred. He should have been saying: \"The chief executive's furious she put her own health at risk for the sake of a commercial transaction and he's ordered her not to come back for at least six months.\" Because the truth is that when you take proper time off after giving birth you actually come back able to handle the real world without bursting into tears or forgetting where you live. Ms Cooper has made history but now she has to follow through. Announcing you are taking 18 weeks off is one thing; actually sticking to it while the phone rings off the hook and ministerial briefings arrive at your door by the cartload is entirely another.

Mr Heard said his stepfather had been murdered because of his colour: \"If Jan had been a white person he would be here today,\" he said. \"There may have been a bit of a fight but he wouldn't be dead.\" Before the murder the family had had to move from a Newport council estate because of racial abuse and threats.

Mr Justice Richards told her: \"You may not have taken part in the physical violence yourself, but I have no doubt that by the things you said you helped to inflame the others. \"You behaved in a disgusting and unacceptable manner and the kind of language you and Carl Rosser used to Mr Pasalbessy does make this offence more serious.\" Mr Pasalbessy was one of eight people in Britain who last year died after a racially motivated attack, up from four the previous year.",

In 1994, Mr Anderson sold his majority stake in the company to Pearson, who guided the company into the big publishing league. Then in 1998, the company was bought back by a consortium comprising Mr Anderson, Future managing director Greg Ingham and venture capitalists Apax Partners. Future reached its zenith in the first few months of 2000, when its share price rose to a high of 926p. But by lunchtime today its share price had fallen to 89p, a drop of more than 90% in less than a year. The company's market capitalisation has fallen from \u00a31bn in 1999 to just over \u00a3100m. Future was once mentioned in a newspaper as one of the 10 best British companies to work for. But the firm's fortunes began to nosedive with the first of three profit warnings issued last year. The first was in October, when around \u00a3300m of Future's value was wiped out after it announced that an accounting error in the accounts of its French arm had overstated sales. Two further profit warnings were issued, the most recent in January, when the share value nearly halved again. Pundits and analysts agree that it was not just the accounting blip that was to blame - Future Network seems to have been hit by every weapon the gods can throw at it. In the first part of last year, backers Apax Partners pulled out. This was merely a harbinger of trouble ahead in the dot.com sector, as - following the fallout in technology stocks - confidence from advertisers and investors bombed. Computing and new economy magazines lost out as dot.coms went to the wall and advertising revenue slumped following profit warnings from computer hardware manufacturers. And to cap it all, the computer games market is reported to have seen an unexpected softening. But other things seemed to conspire against Future. Sony's decision to cut back on production of PlayStation 2 was cited as a reason behind the profit warnings. Another reason was the cost of hiring accountants Deloitte and Touche to investigate the accounting errors in Future's French business.

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Gordon Brown today rejected the possibility of \"irresponsible pre-election giveaways\" and promised he would put economic stability first for every term of a Labour government. In a speech that laid out the groundwork for Labour's election manifesto, Mr Brown pledged that his budget on March 7 - likely to be the last before a predicted May 3 vote - would lock in tough public spending rules. But he added he would introduce \"responsible tax cuts where affordable, for families, pensioners, savings and investment\". He identified five \"economic goals for our generation\": \u0095 Full employment; \u0095 Closing the productivity gap with competing nations; \u0095 The majority of young people going on to higher education; \u0095 Eradicating child poverty: \u0095 Delivering the best public services. The chancellor also criticised the Tories for \"their irresponsible, unfunded, unaffordable and unbelievable tax promises\" in his passionate keynote speech to more than 2,000 delegates at Labour's spring conference in Glasgow. Mr Brown promised that Labour would continue to tackle poverty among children and pensioners, and attacked the Tories for planning to cut public investment and undermine public services. \"We want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to but the potential you were born with,\" he said. \"We will seek a very specific mandate from the people of this country to take the next million children out of poverty, to halve child poverty by 2010 and abolish it in a generation,\" he added. The chancellor said he would be urging a meeting of the G7 finance ministers from the leading industrialised countries tomorrow to follow Britain's lead in cancelling \"the crippling burden of Third World debt\". And he launched a campaign calling on governments and drug companies to give greater access to life-saving drugs and healthcare to eradicate avoidable infant death. In a rallying cry to party activists, the chancellor concluded: \"Let us pledge that for our generation our party's place in history will be measured not just in votes, seats or majorities but in better lives for people who may never know us but whose security and opportunities will, as a result of our common endeavour, be transformed.\" Related special reports Special report: Local government - SocietyGuardian Special report: Election countdown&gt; Useful links Read the text of Gordon Brown's speech Live webcast of Labour's spring conference Comment: Springtime for Labour, by Tony Blair - Tribune magazine http://www.treasury.gov.uk/",

      "bodyText": "It used to be the biggest story in the UK, but mad cow disease is granted precious few column inches in the British press these days. Been there, done that, seen it all before as the saying goes. But in the rest of Europe, BSE is the biggest story of the moment and has been for months. Nor does it show any signs of going away. Europe's public and press are transfixed, obsessed, angry and scared and, as the disease slowly spreads across the continent, hysteria is growing. When Brussels announces draconian new measures to combat BSE - which it seems to do once a month these days - UK officials nonchalantly trot out the same old phrase along the lines of \"because we had it first and worst, we're already doing everything we can so this measure will make no difference to us.\" In contrast, every new twist in the story has continental journalists rushing to the nearest phone to relate the latest appalling new revelations and obligations to their national capitals. Europe is going through what the UK endured in the mid-1990s and, for many people, it is a rude awakening. The continent's dwindling band of anglophiles used to love telling Brits abroad that 'yes, the British are great, but of course you have that terrible mad cow problem don't you?' But you don't hear that anymore - the French and the Germans have fallen silent because now they have BSE too. Along with overweight football hooligans, mad cow disease has become Britain's most notorious export. The fact that the incidence of the disease is only a fraction of what it was in the UK during the 1990s doesn't seem to matter - people are panicking. Beef consumption is in freefall and has dropped by some 30% across Europe since October and by at least 40% in Germany alone. People are becoming vegetarians, eating more chicken and fish and shunning the ubiquitous steak/frites. The bad old days of beef mountains are back and there is even controversial talk of getting rid of the unwanted red meat by exporting it as food aid to the third world. Europe's abattoirs are working overtime slaughtering as many cattle as they can or freezing it for happier days when public confidence may have improved. Incinerators across the continent are struggling to cope with demand and a black pall of smoke is drifting across Europe - beef is definitely off the menu. Few noticed in the UK, but the EU this month moved to ban T-bone steaks or beef on the bone in 10 European countries, including France, Germany and Italy. Nor does Brussels make any secret of the fact that it suspects some European farmers are still feeding cattle ground up animal remains or meat and bonemeal illegally, a practice which is thought to have sparked the disease in the first place. This week, Franz Fischler, the EU's burly Austrian farm chief, unveiled a controversial new plan which will cost one billion euros alone next year, but which is designed to encourage farmers to curb beef production. Do anything, go organic, but for god's sake don't give us any more cows was the gist. In Spain, people can scarcely believe what is happening - not only do they have to put up with an ageing British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless on their doorstep, but now they risk having their national past time, bullfighting wound down because of the so-called British disease. Under new EU rules, cattle aged over 30 months must be tested for BSE or destroyed and that means that the age-old practice of selling the carcasses of fighting bulls to butchers for meat just got a lot more expensive. Spain's two largest farm unions are so angry that they are actively considering suing the British government for spreading the disease in the first place through tainted animal feed. Between 1990 and 1996, the UK exported almost 170,000 tonnes of potentially BSE-infected animal feed to some 70 countries around the globe. And that was at a time when BSE was most prevalent in the British herd. If Europeans did not have enough to worry about already, the European Commission this week revealed that it has drawn up contingency plans in case the disease spreads to sheep. Laboratory tests have shown that BSE can be passed on to sheep and goats, although the disease has not, so far, been detected in the field. EU scientists have concluded, however, that \"it has to be assumed that BSE could have been introduced into parts of the sheep and goat population\" - again because they have been fed meat and bonemeal in the 1990s. To the disbelief of countries like France, where some obviously revelled in Britain's BSE misfortunes a few year ago, the European Commission is actually holding the UK up as an example of how best to fight the disease. But Britain would do well not to crow too loudly or say 'I told you so' too many times, for there is a risk that the government may still face a rash of lawsuits from countries all over Europe for gross negligence in allowing so much tainted feed to be exported.

      "bodyText": "The debt crisis at UK telecoms giant BT is set to worsen after an influential credit rating firm threatened to downgrade the company's status. A credit downgrade will harm BT's chances of raising the cash needed to build the network infrastructure for third generation mobile phones and offer high-speed internet and video services. Standard &amp; Poor's said it had put BT's \"A\" rating under review for a possible downgrade. This will increase the cost of borrowing for the company. \"Based on current information, Standard &amp; Poor's considers it highly likely BT's ratings will be lowered by at least one notch,\" the firm said. The agency added that BT had failed to \"adequately communicate a debt reduction strategy\". Standard &amp; Poor's effectively scorned BT's announcement late last year that it would spin off parts of its business to pay its \u00a330bn debt. BT spent \u00a39bn last year on third generation mobile phone licences in the UK and Germany. Industry observers believe the group may have to shell out the same amount again to set up the networks. Investment bank Goldman Sachs today increased the pressure on the former national monopoly by predicting BT could be heading for an outright break-up. Investors now feel BT's intention to demerge its Yell directories business and partially float its BT Wireless mobile phone arm will not be enough to restore market confidence. Shares in BT, which was unavailable for comment, fell 4%, or 24p, to 566.75p in early trading. BT is not the only telecoms operator feeling the wrath of the financial sector. France Telecom's flotation of Orange proved disappointing this week. Investors have turned away from debt-laden telecoms companies. Fears are mounting that operators will not be able to pay off the massive debts they have accrued in order to lead the mobile phone market. Relevant story Feb 15: BT under pressure from Oftel",

For the past two nights, senior staff have been working at computers until after 1am, trying to meet deadlines. Last time I was here, there was an urgency to get the projects started - to get quilts made and shelters built before the cold really arrived - but that work could not be done after the 9pm curfew. Now, Ockenden International is building up a good reputation in Herat and donors are approaching the office, asking if we can help to run new programmes.</p> <p>Last night, however, I managed to sneak out for an hour after dinner and see a friend of mine who is also \"in town\". The UN agency that she works for has been offered $60,000 by a European government to buy non-food relief items for the displaced people living in the camps - the same camps where we are going to spend $50,000 donated by an Asian government. There now seems to be no shortage of money for the camps and it is becoming increasingly difficult to know how best to spend it. There are more than enough shelters to accommodate the families but some remain empty, as the local authorities are reluctant to move families in. Of course, there are still needs to be met, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify needs that can be met locally and fairly quickly.</p> <p>This morning I went with Latifer, a woman recommended by the ministry of planning, and her brother to Mazlagh Camp, where Ockenden has built shelters for 1,800 families. The drive out is very bumpy and dusty. We pass the customs houses, where hundreds of vehicles are waiting for permission to enter Afghanistan, and an artillery base, filled with tanks waiting to go into action.</p> <p>On the drive, I explained to Latifer that today's job was to try and identify a project that we could give the women in the camps, enabling them to earn food for work. There are too many quilts in Herat now and the World Food Programme has suggested finding something new to do. Knitting was proposed - to produce jumpers, socks and hats - but we didn't know if the women knew how to knit. As it turned out, after interviewing a number of them, one said that she could only make socks. I handed her a ball of pink wool and a pair of knitting needles, but she said that she only knew how to use six needles! Most of the women claimed to be good with a sewing machine, but several said they had sold theirs to buy food.</p> <p>After being away, it was really good to see families living in the shelters built by Ockenden. Some have made their shelters quite comfortable, with wood-burning stoves, tarpaulins on the floors, and quilts piled in the corner. Others are concerned that the roofs are wooden - they are used to mud roofs - and are worried about fire as they all cook in the room, but these worries are slowly being overcome.</p> <p>Later, I met a visitor from an Irish agency that is interested in working through Ockenden in Herat while they get established. I reported back to him on the knitting project, but suggested that a project to make children's clothes might be successful, given the number of women who can use a sewing machine and the number of children who are running around scantily clad. So, this afternoon it was back to the drawing board as I tried to work out how many shalwar kameezes a woman can make each day, how much cloth is needed, how much thread, how many buttons and how many pairs of scissors, etc. And, if the women are paid at 6kg of wheat a day, how much wheat would be needed. All this information must be ready for when he leaves tomorrow, so I guess will have to stand in line for the computer again this evening!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Social services directors and local government leaders held preliminary talks with health minister John Hutton earlier this week over a projected \u00a3205m combined overspend in social services department budgets in England this year. Wednesday's meeting came two weeks after both the Local Government Association (LGA) and the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) called for urgent talks with government to address the massive budget deficit facing social services departments by the end of March. The financial crisis came to light after a survey by the societies of county and municipal treasurers found that 85% of the 146 social services departments surveyed expect to go \u00a32m in the red - equal to 2% per authority. Government policies to improve children's services have been blamed for most of the overspend - accounting for 64%. One important reason is the cost of placing children in both residential and specialist foster care - particularly in the south-east - which has proved a drain on children's services budgets. A further 21% is because of older people's services with 12% going on learning difficulties services and 3% on other services. Calling for ministers to recognise the spending pressures faced by local authorities, Local Government Association chairman Jeremy Beecham said: \"This is obviously a serious financial problem for councils and cannot be sustained in the long term. The number of children in care is rising and the cost of provision especially in residential settings is also increasing.\" He warned that other council services could suffer as a result and council tax bills could soar if the matter was not addressed swiftly. This concern was driven home by Rita Stringfellow, chairwoman of the LGA social affairs and health executive, in a letter to councillors. \"The assumption that significant resources over the next three years will be funded by local authorities, reliant on the standing spending assessment (SSA) formula, was not widely understood,\" it stated. Earlier surveys this financial year had signalled social services departments were facing particularly severe problems, said ADSS president Moira Gibb. In particular, local authorities had been forced to absorb a 4% rise in the number of looked-after children since the previous year. This week an LGA spokesman confirmed preliminary talks had taken place with government ministers over a solution for the problem in the long term. Brian Parrott, chairperson of the ADSS resources committee, said: \"On the children's element of the spending pattern there has been a first meeting between DoH officials, LGA and ADSS representatives with a view to doing further work to examine in detail some of the trends in order to have really good information for the next public expenditure process. \"There is a real willingness to work together, I would be encouraged by that.\" Local authorities are currently planning their budgets for the next financial year and setting council tax levels. However there is no certainty that social services departments will be in line for extra funding before the end of the financial year. The current financial pressures on social services departments have been said to be a result of the cumulative effect of increases in social services provision. While the government has pumped a record \u00a3885m into its Quality Protects initiative to improve the care of and services for looked-after children, most of the cash has been earmarked for new services or specific improvements to current provision. The costs of meeting existing service provision are said to \"significantly exceed\" both the SSA and local authority budgets for social services departments. Mr Parrot added: \"The government will argue that they put money into the SSA and have provided a lot of specific grants - both of which are true - but some of the expectations about the things which will be done are very desirable, but the funding isn't adequate to meet some of the cumulative pressures which social services departments are currently dealing with.\"",

Though the discussions will be friendly, they will cover some thorny ground, including immigration, drugs and trade. The meeting will help both countries prepare for the Summit of the Americas, due to be held in April, in Canada. Bush's first meeting with a foreign head of government was with Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien, days after he took over the White House. Today's meeting, at President Fox's country retreat in the dusty town of San Cristobal, some 200 miles from Mexico City, symbolically underlines the US president's commitment to closer cooperation in the western hemisphere. He has talked, rather grandly, of building \"a century of the Americas\". The US, Canada and Mexico already have economic links, through the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta). But US-Mexican relations have been bedevilled by other forms of trade: illegal immigration and drugs. Mexicans fiercely resent the US system that requires the president to certify each year how some 30 countries are cooperating in international efforts to stamp out drug smuggling. Mexico has never failed the test, but is annually insulted by it. Its officials point out that the trade is fuelled by soaring demand in the US, and that Washington should tackle its own problem of drug consumption, rather than humiliate the producer and transit countries. Bush evidently has some sympathy with that view. White House aides say the new administration is reviewing the value of the certification process.

The case centred on a Daily Mail story that accused him of being \"miserly\" in his stewardship of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. \"I didn't do it for the money. Newspapers will have to be more responsible,\" Mr Sugar said afterwards. Sugar won a unanimous verdict from the jury in the case. The 53-year-old businessman sued the Daily Mail over a December 1999 story by soccer writer Jeff Powell. The piece stated Sugar must come out of his \"counting house\" and give manager George Graham money to buy high-class players. Mr Powell denied libel and pleaded fair comment. \"This case was about freedom of expression,\" a spokesman for the newspaper said. \"Jeff Powell and the Daily Mail were defending their right to comment in hard-hitting terms on a matter of public interest.\" Mr Sugar recently relinquished his chairmanship of Spurs after complaining about constant pressure from fans. Former Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham, among others, gave evidence at the trial.",

Inspirations for Your Home, published by GE magazines, sank to 72,291 from 112,121. One media buyer said the market was \"totally oversaturated\" and suggested the proliferation of TV shows such as Changing Rooms may have contributed to the decline in the magazine audience. \"I regret to say that this is a magazine market that has become totally saturated,\" said Duncan Edwards, deputy managing director of NatMags. He added that the company was \"committed\" to House Beautiful, the magazine launched in the late 1980s and credited with revolutionising the sector. IPC Southbank managing director Tim Brook said the home interest market was due for a shakeout. \"There have been a lot of launches over the past year from smaller companies trying to grab a slice of the market,\" he said. He added that the market was \"Darwinian\" and predicted that \"as new species enter the market, some titles will go to the wall\".

      "body": "<p>It is hard to keep up with Ian Hart. One minute he's deadpanning it in a silly romantic comedy and the next he's gone all sepia in one of those unflinching Depression movies that see craggy faces like his as part of the industrial landscape. To get his opinions on these two latest outings, he has to be hauled off the set of Harry Potter. What's he doing in that? \"Well, put it like this, if you're not a kid, you're a wizard.\" </p> <p>Hart is acerbically witty and one of the most scratchily, self-laceratingly talented actors to not-quite-arrive in the last decade. He is big enough to carry your average British movie, but unfortunately the average British movie is, well, average, and there doesn't seem to be an easy way out of it for a first-class character actor. </p> <p>In Liam, a low-budget film released next week, you see exactly his predicament. Hart plays the father of the seven-year-old title character: a Liverpool shipyard worker who loses his job, his pride and finally his head in the slump of the 1930s. Written by Jimmy McGovern and directed by Stephen Frears, it is a humane and all too credible portrait of the corrosive power of poverty, which draws its emotional strength from understatement. </p> <p>At 36, Hart is rather young to play the father of three children, two practically grown-up, and yet he creates a character who is entirely credible. The camera hikes around his features, revelling in the bleakness it finds in them. That bleakness echoes the spareness of the dialogue. There is such an obvious understanding between writer and actor - quite apart from the fact that they are both from Liverpool - that it seems bizarre that this is the first time Hart and McGovern have worked together. \"The great thing about Jimmy's writing is that the dialogue is so clear,\" says Hart. \"It's all very simple and should be done that way. The images are woven into it.\" </p> <p>The images are born of Catholic guilt and repression - and Hart remembers them well from his own childhood. One of three children born to a Catholic family in an \"arse-end estate in Knotty Ash\", he emerged from his altar-boy phase with a healthy contempt for authority, parti- cularly when wielded by men in frocks. </p> <p>\"When you get to 15 and most of your teachers are priests, there's bound to be a conflict,\" he shrugs. After leaving grammar school (where he was advised by his careers officer to join the army), he went to college to take A levels. There, by his own report, he fell out with just about everyone. He won a place at drama school in London at 18, but left after two weeks' sleeping rough. \"It was an abomination: nothing to do with acting. I went and got a job; you learn more doing that than doing training.\" </p> <p>Though some of his jobs were in the theatre, others were not. Over the years, he has delivered cakes and worked in kitchens, on a farm and in a plastics factory. He also spent a while making corporate videos on subjects like \"sewage treatment and John West salmon\". It wasn't glamorous, but \"it meant I was relatively technically adept, I can edit and wire up a light\". </p> <p>His career path might suggest that he is one of those instinctive actors with little time for technique, and yet he is a ferociously intelligent performer who is conscientious to a fault. That much was clear when, back in the summer, he appeared in The Closer You Get, a sort of Irish Full Monty, as a village butcher involved in a plan to lure some willing blondes from Texas. Hart seemed to have conceived the character of Kieran around the testicles: his absent-minded rubbing became not only a comic motif but a defining characteristic of a young man in a state of primal, and pongy, innocence. For once, he wore his technique on the outside. </p> <p>He is not usually so obvious. He played John Lennon so well, in two separate films (notably in Backbeat), that he has spent years since proving that he is not simply a Scouse specialist. Anyone who dismisses him as a one-tune wonder clearly hasn't seen his 18th-century clockmaker's son in the TV costume drama Longitude, his psychopathic Unionist thug in Thaddeus O'Sullivan's Belfast-set chiller Nothing Personal, or his hapless private eye in Neil Jordan's adaptation of The End of the Affair. </p> <p>It's a curious fact, he says, that he has probably made as many Irish films as most Irish actors. \"In fact, I've only used my own voice about four times on film.\" Yet when he recently appeared as Nobby Stiles in a biopic of George Best, the tag \"resolutely Scouse\" came back to haunt him. \"That bugged me because it implied that I hadn't done my job properly and that's not the case.\" In fact, he based his portrayal on a scrupulously studied tape recording of the footballer's voice. </p> <p>If he is scornful of the lazy and the second-rate, he is also his own toughest critic. There is a scene in Liam in which he lurches to his feet in church and begins to hurl insults at the pulpit. \"I did it again and again in all different ways, and the next day when I woke up I knew what I should have done: but that's the performance I gave and the audience won't know any different.\" </p> <p>Of The End of the Affair, he says: \"I could enjoy the 60% of the film I wasn't in. I hate me. I always see the mistakes I made. Just because someone else didn't notice it, it doesn't mean that it isn't there.\" </p> <p>His reluctance to watch himself on film can have results which even he finds sickly funny. Once, returning to the US two years after making a film there, he plucked up courage to watch it on video in his hotel room, only to find that his part had been almost entirely erased. Worse, the bit that did remain was a scene in which he played an American playing an Englishman. \"It was out of context so it looked as if I was bad at both.\" </p> <p>At the last count, he knows that he has to shrug it off; it is part of the actor's lot to be at the disposal of directors and producers. \"I only ask that everyone should be good at what they do. What I don't like is having to be on set and working your bollocks off and some bloody production assistant hasn't got the bag of crisps you need. That's what I like about Neil Jordan's films: everyone is better at what they do than you are.\" </p> <p>He has made three films so far with Jordan, and, in a rare and expensive mark of respect, Jordan agreed to reshoot Hart's death scene in Michael Collins, even though it involved helicopters and crowds of extras. \"The thing about Neil,\" says Hart, \"is that he creates a very good atmosphere to work in. He trusts actors. He's very honest - sometimes brutally so. If it's not working you're going to hear about it. You're not left to hang yourself.\" </p> <p>There, perhaps, is one key to Hart - a fear of hanging himself which has led to a raw, strafing bolshiness that is not to be confused with arrogance. Ken Loach, who directed him in Land and Freedom, one of his first and finest successes, says: \"The film we did together was quite extraordinary in a way, in that it was a group of people, some of whom were actors and some of whom were not, and we had to turn them into a militia. </p> <p>\"I think it was probably quite unnerving for Ian to begin with, particularly since many of them were Spanish. But he chipped in very well. He was very direct and straight, which are the qualities I tend to look for. Even though he had the main part, he didn't ask for, and wasn't given, any special attention. But he made it his own. He's also got a good dry sense of humour.\" </p> <p>Land and Freedom is the film Hart is proudest of, and one of his regrettably few starring roles. That dry sense of humour stands him in good stead as he contemplates the future - in particular his sudden professional leap in age. In the salsa comedy Born Romantic, he is a greasy-spoon cynic whose sour observations on women and relationships frame the romantic shenanigans of just such young oddballs as he might himself have played a couple of years back. He reckons he has finally waved goodbye to a long line of arrested adolescents. \"It's not any desire on my part to start playing dads, but it's a convention of drama. If you don't get the parts of young people going out to nightclubs, you have to play their fathers.\" </p> <p>At least the scripts keep on coming in, enabling him to pick and choose, while living in comfort in north London with his teacher wife and their four-year-old daughter. He will only take parts that interest him, however small they are. \"I've done some poop,\" he says, \"but only because it turned out that way.\" </p> <p>Liam is released on February 23 and Born Romantic on March 9.</p>",

Future Network is planning to amalgamate its online magazine sites into a single \"portal\" with different channels. But an estimated 75 online staff internationally will lose their jobs. Staff at the company's Bath headquarters were given further details of the cuts at a meeting this morning. Future Network is also considering putting its high-profile new economy title Business 2.0 up for sale. The French arm of the business is to sell five of its titles, while the US company will sell six. Future Network has 130 magazine titles worldwide and employs 2,000 staff, of whom 1,200 are based in the UK. It is not known whether the launch of Future's high-profile Xbox magazine is to shelved. The cutbacks follow a series of profit warnings from the company, with the share price falling by 87% in the past six months. At the end of last year Future reported a black hole in the accounts of its French subsidiary. The firm's ABC figures, announced this morning, showed that most of the publisher's titles had seen falls in circulation. Relevant story Feb 16: Future axes 350",

      "bodyText": "Ralph Bulger, the father of murdered toddler James Bulger, today lost his high court challenge to keep his son's killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, in prison. Three senior judges rejected accusations that the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, had set a minimum sentence for the child killers which was so low - given the enormity of the crime - that it threatened to \"undermine confidence in the criminal justice system\". Lord Justice Rose, sitting with Mr Justice Sullivan and Mr Justice Penry-Davey, ruled that Ralph Bulger did not have legal standing to challenge the tariff. They also refused Mr Bulger permission to appeal against their decision. The heart of the decision is that victims do not have the right to intervene in tariffs set by the court. The decision was a bitter defeat for Mr Bulger in his attempt to overturn Lord Woolf's recommendation last October which allows Thompson and Venables to be considered for parole in the near future. \"I am absolutely devastated by today's ruling. I have spent two years trying to get this back to court and it now seems it is all over,\" Mr Bulger said in a statement. In his ruling in October Lord Woolf took into account that neither boy had shown \"any aggression or propensity for violence during his period of detention\" after being sentenced for the crime. But lawyers for Mr Bulger argued that Lord Woolf's recommendation to reduce the child killers' tariff for retribution and deterrence to seven years and eight months should be quashed because of the new evidence about Thompson and other flaws in the judge's decision. It was claimed the tariff should be reconsidered because of the \"astounding\" failure of the Home Office authorities to tell the judge of newspaper reports that Thompson had been involved in two violent incidents. Lord Woolf went wrong in law when he cut the tariff because he put rehabilitation before the needs of punishment and deterrence, lawyers for Mr Bulger claimed. Thompson and Venables, who were 10 when they abducted and tortured two-year-old James on a railway line in Liverpool in 1993, have so far served their sentences in secure local authority accommodation.

      "body": "<p>Confronted with any issue involving the US military, American politicians go brain dead.</p> <p>With an occasional honourable exception, they revert to being boys with toys, adopting a servility and a sycophancy more appropriate to a dictatorship than to a democracy.</p> <p>In modern American politics, as in some other countries, the military exists only to be flattered, praised and fawned over. But the intensity of the American adoration of the military is exceptional.</p> <p>As a result, American politicians use the military to parade their patriotic credentials rather than their capacity for objective judgment. To attempt even constructive criticism of the military is to invite political suicide, especially for a Democrat, so most of them never bother to try.</p> <p>This week, George Bush has been on a series of defence related events, helping to promote his plans for extra military spending and new military deployments, notably the missile defence system. True to type, he has made the usual speeches about brave men and women in uniform.</p> <p>Equally true to type, he has avoided any discussion of the latest American military disaster, an event from which most Americans seem instinctively to have averted their eyes.</p> <p>It is now nearly a week since the USS Greeneville nuclear powered attack submarine rose from the ocean just south of Hawaii, in an area where it was not supposed to be, and smashed into a Japanese fishing vessel, the Ehime Maru.</p> <p>The fishing vessel rapidly sank to the floor of the Pacific, taking nine of its 35-strong crew with it. Four of the dead were school students on a training exercise.</p> <p>In the US, the incident was a big story when it happened, but it rapidly disappeared from the front pages - though not from the Japanese front pages.</p> <p>But now, with the revelation that the Greeneville was full of civilian businessmen getting a grace and favour spin in a US Navy sub, and that two of the civilians were actually sitting at the controls as the sub surfaced, the story has forced its way back into the headlines. Even so, it is an object lesson in the inadequacy of civilian scrutiny of military matters.</p> <p>Yesterday, two of the 16 civilians who were on the Greeneville went on NBC television's breakfast show to describe their experiences. One of them, John Hall, described how he was allowed to pull the levers for the Greeneville's emergency ascent drill that led to the destruction of the Ehime Maru.</p> <p>Another, Todd Thoman, explained that the sub came up to periscope depth and completed a series of 360-degree scans of the ocean, but without spotting the fishing boat.</p> <p>Then as the Greeneville surged to the surface there was \"a very loud noise and the entire submarine shuddered\". Commander Scott Waddle then uttered words which, in the circumstances, are to be applauded for their restraint. \"Jesus, what the hell was that,\" he said.</p> <p>Separately, a Hawaii television station reported yesterday that another two of the civilian guests were local businessmen. All 16, the station reported, were large donors to the USS Missouri Restoration Fund, a fund whose purpose is to maintain the old battleship now used as a visitor centre in nearby Pearl Harbour on Oahu island in Hawaii.</p> <p>Five years ago, when a US air force fighter sliced through a ski-lift cable in the Italian Alps, killing a cable-car full of skiers, the instinctive reaction of the military was to deny responsibility, destroy incriminating evidence, and refuse to hand the suspects over to local jurisdictions. Instead, the pilot and navigator were eventually tried in a court martial in the US.</p> <p>Now, in the Greenville incident, several of the same reflexes have come into play. The Navy has been slow to respond truthfully, evasive about the events, and insensitive to the feelings of its foreign victims.</p> <p>In particular, one gets a nagging sense in some responses that Japanese losses at American hands in the vicinity of Pearl Harbour are not all that serious, what with one thing and another. The good news is that some of the things that should have been done much more quickly are at least now being done.</p> <p>A proper search is being organised. Japanese sensibilities are beginning to register. The sloppiness of the Navy's behaviour is beginning to be criticised, though not by any politician that I have yet noticed.</p> <p>But the Greeneville has been an illustration of the difficulty which Americans have about looking their military in the eye. Too often, proper scrutiny of military matters is blinded by the flag and by an obsequious attitude to US military power and authority.</p> <p>And if it is difficult to get the facts and to be objective about a relatively small thing like this accident, then how much more difficult is it to get the facts and be objective about a really big thing like the multi-billion dollar missile defence programme? But it is all part of the same failing.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George W Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4137081,00.html\">16.2.2001: Civilian was 'invited' to raise vessel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4136433,00.html\">15.2.2001: 'I saw something; I thought it was a whale' </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4134573,00.html\">11.2.2001: Nine die as US sub sinks trawler</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28martin+kettle%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=martin+kettle&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Martin Kettle</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Washington Post</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.asahi.com/english/english.html\" target=\"_new\">Asahi Shimbun newspaper</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.whitehouse.gov/\" target=\"_new\">The White House</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/\" target=\"_new\">US department of defence</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2001/t02132001_t213dasd.html\" target=\"_new\"> Press conference: US department of defence</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.mofa.go.jp/\" target=\"_new\">Japanese foreign ministry</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/press/2001/2/213.html#2\" target=\"_new\">Press conference - Japanese foreign ministry </a> <br><a href=\" http://www.cpf.navy.mil/greeneville.html\" target=\"_new\">Greeneville incident - US Pacific Fleet</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Confronted with any issue involving the US military, American politicians go brain dead. With an occasional honourable exception, they revert to being boys with toys, adopting a servility and a sycophancy more appropriate to a dictatorship than to a democracy. In modern American politics, as in some other countries, the military exists only to be flattered, praised and fawned over. But the intensity of the American adoration of the military is exceptional. As a result, American politicians use the military to parade their patriotic credentials rather than their capacity for objective judgment. To attempt even constructive criticism of the military is to invite political suicide, especially for a Democrat, so most of them never bother to try. This week, George Bush has been on a series of defence related events, helping to promote his plans for extra military spending and new military deployments, notably the missile defence system. True to type, he has made the usual speeches about brave men and women in uniform. Equally true to type, he has avoided any discussion of the latest American military disaster, an event from which most Americans seem instinctively to have averted their eyes. It is now nearly a week since the USS Greeneville nuclear powered attack submarine rose from the ocean just south of Hawaii, in an area where it was not supposed to be, and smashed into a Japanese fishing vessel, the Ehime Maru. The fishing vessel rapidly sank to the floor of the Pacific, taking nine of its 35-strong crew with it. Four of the dead were school students on a training exercise. In the US, the incident was a big story when it happened, but it rapidly disappeared from the front pages - though not from the Japanese front pages. But now, with the revelation that the Greeneville was full of civilian businessmen getting a grace and favour spin in a US Navy sub, and that two of the civilians were actually sitting at the controls as the sub surfaced, the story has forced its way back into the headlines. Even so, it is an object lesson in the inadequacy of civilian scrutiny of military matters. Yesterday, two of the 16 civilians who were on the Greeneville went on NBC television's breakfast show to describe their experiences. One of them, John Hall, described how he was allowed to pull the levers for the Greeneville's emergency ascent drill that led to the destruction of the Ehime Maru. Another, Todd Thoman, explained that the sub came up to periscope depth and completed a series of 360-degree scans of the ocean, but without spotting the fishing boat. Then as the Greeneville surged to the surface there was \"a very loud noise and the entire submarine shuddered\". Commander Scott Waddle then uttered words which, in the circumstances, are to be applauded for their restraint. \"Jesus, what the hell was that,\" he said. Separately, a Hawaii television station reported yesterday that another two of the civilian guests were local businessmen. All 16, the station reported, were large donors to the USS Missouri Restoration Fund, a fund whose purpose is to maintain the old battleship now used as a visitor centre in nearby Pearl Harbour on Oahu island in Hawaii. Five years ago, when a US air force fighter sliced through a ski-lift cable in the Italian Alps, killing a cable-car full of skiers, the instinctive reaction of the military was to deny responsibility, destroy incriminating evidence, and refuse to hand the suspects over to local jurisdictions. Instead, the pilot and navigator were eventually tried in a court martial in the US. Now, in the Greenville incident, several of the same reflexes have come into play. The Navy has been slow to respond truthfully, evasive about the events, and insensitive to the feelings of its foreign victims. In particular, one gets a nagging sense in some responses that Japanese losses at American hands in the vicinity of Pearl Harbour are not all that serious, what with one thing and another. The good news is that some of the things that should have been done much more quickly are at least now being done. A proper search is being organised. Japanese sensibilities are beginning to register. The sloppiness of the Navy's behaviour is beginning to be criticised, though not by any politician that I have yet noticed. But the Greeneville has been an illustration of the difficulty which Americans have about looking their military in the eye. Too often, proper scrutiny of military matters is blinded by the flag and by an obsequious attitude to US military power and authority. And if it is difficult to get the facts and to be objective about a relatively small thing like this accident, then how much more difficult is it to get the facts and be objective about a really big thing like the multi-billion dollar missile defence programme? But it is all part of the same failing.

      "body": "<p>As Billie Holiday later told the story, a single gesture by a patron at a New York nightclub changed the history of American music. It was early 1939, the night that Holiday first sang Strange Fruit. The venue was Caf\u00e9 Society in Greenwich Village, New York's only truly integrated nightclub, a place catering for progressive types with open minds. Even here, Holiday was afraid to sing this new song, a song that tackled racial hatred head-on at a time when protest music was all but unknown. \"There wasn't even a patter of applause when I finished,\" she wrote later. \"Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everybody was clapping.\" </p> <p>The famed songwriter EY Harburg called Strange Fruit a \"historic document\". The jazz writer Leonard Feather said it was \"the first significant protest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism\". The record producer Ahmet Ertegun called the song, which Holiday first sang 16 years before Rosa Parks refused to yield her seat on an Alabama bus, \"a declaration of war... the beginning of the civil rights movement\". </p> <p>Strange Fruit pops up in many places now. Leon Litwack, the Pulitzer prize-winning historian of the American civil war, uses it in his classes at the University of California at Berkeley. A federal appeals court judge cited it a few years ago to show that execution by hanging was inherently \"cruel and unusual\". Khallil Abdul Muhammad, Louis Farrakhan's notoriously anti-Semitic disciple and maestro of the Million Man March, has quoted it in speeches assailing American racism - unaware, apparently, that the song was written by a white Jewish schoolteacher from New York City named Abel Meeropol. </p> <p>Meeropol, who wrote under the pen name Lewis Allan, did not write the song for Holiday; and yet so completely did Holiday come to own Strange Fruit that Meeropol spent half a lifetime reminding people that it was really his creation, and his alone. Few people seemed to be able to accept that so potent a song could come from so prosaic a source. Newspaper articles saddled Meeropol with a range of purported collaborators. \"One Lewis Allen [sic] is cited as the author of Strange Fruit, but did he compose both words and music?\" the composer and diarist Ned Rorem, a passionate Holiday devotee, wrote in the New York Times in 1995, nine years after Meeropol's death. \"Indeed, who was he? Was he black?\" (To the organisers of a celebration of black composers at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in 1999, the answer was yes, for they included Strange Fruit on the programme.) </p> <p>In a way, Meeropol sealed his own fate, his status as a historical footnote, when he decided that it was Billie Holiday to whom he'd bring the song: she made it her own more effectively than any other artist ever could have. \"When you listen to her, it's almost like an audio tape of her autobiography,\" said Tony Bennett. \"She didn't sing anything unless she had lived it.\" </p> <p>Holiday was only 24 years old in 1939, but she had already experienced enough prejudice and despair by then to call herself a \"race woman\". She began performing in Harlem in the late 1920s; by 1933, she had been discovered by the record producer John Hammond, who quickly teamed her with Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson and other legendary musicians of the day. Together, they made what became some of Holiday's finest and most beloved records: I Wished on a Moon, What a Little Moonlight Will Do and Me Myself and I, to cite just three. In the late 1930s, she toured with the bands of Count Basie and Artie Shaw. </p> <p>Though all of the hard knocks helped Holiday infuse everything she sang with a unique mixture of resilience, defiance, exuberance and shrewdness, her songs, at least on paper, were invariably what her first biographer, Linda Kuehl, called \"second cousins to her favourite reading: love comics and true romance magazines\" - that is, bland, banal ballads. Politics, and particularly racial politics, had never influenced her choice of material until Strange Fruit came along. </p> <p>Holiday's autobiography - co-written by William Dufty and entitled Lady Sings the Blues - offers an account of the song's origins that may set a new record for most misinformation per column inch. (Holiday later tried to fob off the blame on Dufty: \"Shit, man, I ain't never read that book,\" she said. In fact, because her publishers were skittish about the entire undertaking, they made her read and sign every page of the manuscript.) \"The germ of the song was in a poem by Lewis Allen,\" Holiday declared in the book. \"When he showed me that poem, I dug it right off. It seemed to spell out all the things that had killed Pop.\" </p> <p>As Holiday told the story, her father, a musician in Fletcher Henderson's band, was exposed to poison gas as a soldier during world war one and died of pneumonia in 1937 after several segregated Southern hospitals refused to treat him. \"Allen had heard how Pop died and of course was interested in my singing. He suggested that Sonny White (who had been my accompanist) and I turn it into music. So the three of us got together and did the job in about three weeks.\" </p> <p>In fact, Meeropol had never met Holiday and apparently knew nothing about her father, who probably never fought in Europe in world war one and is unlikely to have been gassed there. </p> <p>An English teacher at De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx for 27 years, Meeropol led two other, parallel lives. One was as a political activist: he and his wife were closet communists, donating a percentage of their earnings to the party. The other was as a writer, poet and composer. Meeropol wrote incessantly - poems, ballads, musicals, plays - all using the nom de plume \"Lewis Allan\", the names of his two natural-born children, neither of whom survived infancy. Though he had his admirers - including Ira Gershwin, Kurt Weill and the Nobel prize-winning novelist Thomas Mann - most of his work was quickly forgotten and now sits in dusty heaps at Boston University. </p> <p>Lynchings - during which black people were murdered with unspeakable brutality, often in a carnival-like atmosphere and then hung from trees for all to see - were rampant in the South following the civil war and for many years thereafter. Conservative figures put the number of people lynched between 1889 and 1940 at 3,833; 90% of them were murdered in the South, and four fifths of them were black. Lynchings tended to occur in poor, small towns - often taking the place, as the newspaper columnist HL Mencken once said, \"of the merry-go-round, the theatre, the symphony orchestra\". They involved either the whole community or a cabal of vigilantes, often in disguise. And they were meted out for a host of alleged offences - not just murder, theft and rape, but for insulting a white person, boasting, swearing or buying a car. In some instances, there was no infraction at all; it was just time to remind \"uppity\" blacks to stay in their place. </p> <p>The numbers gradually declined. Officially, there were only three lynchings in 1939 - the year Holiday first sang about them. Still, a survey taken that year revealed that more than six in 10 Southerners thought lynchings to be justified in cases of sexual assault. And despite a long campaign by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Congress had never managed to pass a federal anti-lynching law. </p> <p>Lynchings may have been localised affairs, but as Gunnar Myrdal pointed out in An American Dilemma, his 1944 study of race relations in the US, they brutalised people everywhere. \"Even in the north, some people have ceased to be concerned when another lynching occurs, and they jest about going south to see a lynching,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Meeropol, clearly, was not among them. In fact, it is possible that what inspired him to write Strange Fruit was a double lynching that took place north of the Mason Dixon line - in Marion, Indiana, in 1930 - immortalised in a shocking and widely publicised photograph. In any case, it was around that time that Meeropol came across a photograph of a particularly ghastly lynching in a civil rights magazine which, he said, haunted him for days. So he wrote a poem about it, which first saw print - as Bitter Fruit - in the January 1937 issue of the New York Teacher, a union publication. </p> <p>Meeropol often asked others to set his poems to music. But with Strange Fruit he insisted on doing the task himself. The song was then performed regularly in left-wing circles - by Meeropol's wife, by progressive friends at gatherings in hotels and bungalow colonies around New York, by members of the local teachers' union, and by a quartet of black singers at a fund-raiser for the anti-fascists during the Spanish civil war. As it happened, the co-producer of that fund-raiser, Robert Gordon, was also directing the first floor show at Caf\u00e9 Society, which had opened in December 1938. The featured attraction: Billie Holiday, who had just quit Artie Shaw's band, in part because she'd been forced to take the freight elevator during a gig at a New York hotel. </p> <p>Caf\u00e9 Society was unusual even for New York City. The brainchild of Barney Josephson, a shoe salesman from New Jersey with progressive sympathies, it mocked the empty celebrity worship, right-wing politics, snootiness and racial discrimination of popular New York hangouts like the Stork Club. The doormen wore rags and stood by as the customers opened the doors themselves; the bartenders were all veterans of the anti-fascist Abraham Lincoln Brigade; blacks and whites fraternised on stage and off. As one press account described it, the club had \"no girlie line, no smutty gags, no Uncle Tom comedy\". It was probably the only place in America where Strange Fruit could have been sung and savoured. </p> <p>Meeropol brought Strange Fruit to Josephson and Bob Gordon at the new nightclub in or around January 1939. \"I read the lyrics, and I was just floored by them,\" Josephson told a documentary crew in 1983. \"I said, 'What do you want to do with this?' He said, 'I would love to have Billie do this song.' \" Shortly afterwards, Meeropol sat down at Caf\u00e9 Society's piano and played it for Holiday. Neither Tin Pan Alley nor jazz, closer to the cabaret tradition of Blitzstein than anything else, it was alien to her, and she appeared indifferent. </p> <p>\"To be perfectly frank, I didn't think she felt comfortable with the song,\" Meeropol wrote later. \"I feel almost certain that if she had to choose from a number of songs at that time, it would not have been Strange Fruit.\" The Holiday he remembered was \"not communicative at all\" that day and had asked only one question about the song: what did \"pastoral\" mean? </p> <p>Josephson, who rarely asked Holiday to perform anything, later maintained that she \"didn't know what the hell the song meant\" and sang it originally only as a favour to him. \"She looked at me after [Meeropol had] finished and said, 'What do you want me to do with that, man?' and I said, 'It would be wonderful if you'd sing it. If you care to. You don't have to.' And she said, 'You wants me to sing it? I sings it.' \" Not until a few months later, when he spotted a tear running down her cheek during one performance, was Josephson convinced that she had finally grasped just what those strange fruit were. </p> <p>According to Meeropol, who went to Caf\u00e9 Society to hear her introduce the song, Holiday sang Strange Fruit with conviction and understanding from the beginning. \"She gave a startling, most dramatic and effective interpretation, which could jolt an audience out of its complacency anywhere,\" he wrote. \"This was exactly what I wanted the song to do and why I wrote it_ The audience gave her a tremendous ovation.\" </p> <p>So did Holiday grasp the meaning of Strange Fruit or was she oblivious to it all? Holiday, it is true, was in some ways unsophisticated, and the song was unlike anything she had done. Josephson's version of events nonetheless seems harsh and patronising. That Holiday could not have known precisely what she was singing about and felt it deeply is inconceivable. Barry Ulanov, a jazz scholar who heard her sing it while he was a student at Columbia, suggested an alternative: Holiday understood the song but was uncomfortable with it and was particularly uncomfortable that others were pressuring her to sing it. That she sang with such ferocity and anger, he speculated, reflected both what the song said and what she wanted to say herself: So you say you want to hear about lynching, do you? Well then I'm really going to give it to you! </p> <p>\"She was not out there simply making a social or political plea,\" Ulanov said. \"She was saying something in her own complex way.\" </p> <p>One story has it that Holiday's mother objected when she began singing Strange Fruit and asked her why she was doing it. Because it could make things better, Holiday replied. </p> <p>\"But you'll be dead,\" her mother insisted. </p> <p>\"Yeah, but I'll feel it,\" Holiday said. \"I'll know it in my grave.\" </p> <p>Witnessing Strange Fruit at Caf\u00e9 Society was a visual as well as an auditory experience. Josephson, who called the song \"agitprop\", decreed elaborate stage directions for each of the three nightly performances. Holiday was to close each set with it. Before she began, all service stopped. Waiters, cashiers, busboys were all immobilised. The room went completely dark, save for a pin spot on Holiday's face. When she was finished and the lights went out, she was to walk off the stage, and no matter how thunderous the ovation, she was never to return for a bow. \"People had to remember Strange Fruit, get their insides burned with it,\" Josephson later said. Miscreants were apparently dealt with harshly. \"At Caf\u00e9 Society I used to wonder at how quiet for a nightclub it was when I sang,\" Holiday recalled in 1949. \"I found out later the waiters made a habit of going up to the noisiest characters and saying, 'Miss Holiday is afraid you aren't enjoying yourself. Pay up and go.' \" </p> <p>Holiday left Caf\u00e9 Society after nine months, moving up to the jazz clubs of West 52nd Street. When it came to singing Strange Fruit, she chose her spots carefully, but even in ostensibly safe locales the song wasn't always well received. \"Lots of people walked out on the song, party after party, because they said, 'We don't call this entertainment',\" Josephson said. \"I remember a time a woman followed Billie into the powder room. Billie was wearing a strapless gown and she tried to brush the woman off. The woman became hysterical with tears - 'Don't you sing that song again! Don't you dare!' she screamed - and ripped Billie's dress. I asked her to leave. She started to cry again. She explained she came to Caf\u00e9 Society to have fun and here she heard Billie sing about 'burning flesh' and it brought back a lynching she had seen when she was seven or eight years old down south. She saw a black man tied by the throat to a back fender of a car, dragged through the streets, hung up and burned. She thought she forgot it and Billie brought it back.\" </p> <p>Drugs and alcohol had been part of Holiday's life for years - between sets at Caf\u00e9 Society she would routinely smoke marijuana in a cab riding around Central Park - but only in the early 1940s did she begin taking heroin, then mainlining it. That, plus the death of her mother and a series of disastrous relationships with abusive men, sent her life into a desperate, downward spiral. In the spring of 1947 she checked into a New York hospital for detoxification. A few months later, in Philadelphia, she was busted and spent nearly a year in a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>With every increment of abuse Holiday endured, Strange Fruit became more personal to her. The confidence with which she'd first sung it gave way to pure pathos. Watching her undertake it could be both exhilarating and excruciating. </p> <p>Even decades later, the experience of listening to and watching her perform Strange Fruit - eyes closed and head back, the familiar gardenia over her ear, fingers snapping lightly - lingered in many memories. The actress Billie Allen Henderson recalled how, during Holiday's appearance at New York's Birdland in 1952, the maitre d' actually confiscated all cigarettes before Holiday began singing it. \"I was standing there with my date when she started singing this song,\" she recalled. \"I was trying to be sophisticated and all of a sudden something stabs me in the solar plexus and I was gasping for air. It was so deeply felt. I understood it_ I could smell the burning flesh; I felt it. She was . . . unrelenting is a good word for it. Some didn't know how to react. They weren't quite sure. Nobody stirred. It was startling, and I'll never forget it. I thought, 'That's what art can do.'\" </p> <p>In The Heart of a Woman, Maya Angelou recounts how, during a visit to Los Angeles in 1958, Holiday sang Strange Fruit to Angelou's young son, Guy. </p> <p> Billie talked and sang in a hoarse, dry tone the well-known protest song. Her rasping voice and phrasing literally enchanted me. I saw the black bodies hanging from the Southern trees. I saw the lynch victims' blood glide from the leaves down the trunks and on to the roots. </p> <p>Guy interrupted: \"How can there be blood at the root?\" I made a hard face and warned him, \"Shut up, Guy, just listen.\" Billie had continued under the interruption, her voice vibrating over harsh edges. </p> <p>She painted a picture of a lovely land, pastoral and bucolic, then added eyes bulged and mouths twisted, onto the Southern landscape. </p> <p>Guy broke into her song. \"What's a pastoral scene, Miss Holiday?\" Billie looked up slowly and studied Guy for a second. Her face became cruel, and when she spoke her voice was scornful. \"It means when the crackers are killing the niggers. It means when they take a little nigger like you and snatch off his nuts and shove them down his goddam throat. That's what it means.\" </p> <p>The thrust of the rage repelled Guy and stunned me. </p> <p>Billie continued: \"That's what they do. That's a goddamn pastoral scene.\" </p> <p>Holiday performed it again in London in February 1959, in a televised concert that has since been excerpted in several documentaries. Haggard, largely wasted away, she had grown oddly, sadly suited to capture the full grotesqueness of the song. Now she not only sang of bulging eyes and twisted mouths. She embodied them. </p> <p>Holiday died in July that year, aged 44. Meeropol died in 1986, in a Jewish nursing home near Springfield, Massachusetts. Strange Fruit was sung at his memorial service. </p> <p>To some, the song remains too hot to handle. In the 1980s, a disc jockey in North Carolina came across a collection of Billie Holiday standards in the station's library. Strange Fruit was circled, with the admonitions \"Watch\" and \"Do not play\" printed next to it. And when Robert Meeropol, Abel's younger son, flew on United Airlines a couple of years ago, he noticed that Cassandra Wilson's album New Moon Daughter was among the in-flight entertainment, but that its first cut - Strange Fruit - was missing. </p> <p>\u00a9 David Margolick.

      "bodyText": "As Billie Holiday later told the story, a single gesture by a patron at a New York nightclub changed the history of American music. It was early 1939, the night that Holiday first sang Strange Fruit. The venue was Caf\u00e9 Society in Greenwich Village, New York's only truly integrated nightclub, a place catering for progressive types with open minds. Even here, Holiday was afraid to sing this new song, a song that tackled racial hatred head-on at a time when protest music was all but unknown. \"There wasn't even a patter of applause when I finished,\" she wrote later. \"Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everybody was clapping.\" The famed songwriter EY Harburg called Strange Fruit a \"historic document\". The jazz writer Leonard Feather said it was \"the first significant protest in words and music, the first unmuted cry against racism\". The record producer Ahmet Ertegun called the song, which Holiday first sang 16 years before Rosa Parks refused to yield her seat on an Alabama bus, \"a declaration of war... the beginning of the civil rights movement\". Strange Fruit pops up in many places now. Leon Litwack, the Pulitzer prize-winning historian of the American civil war, uses it in his classes at the University of California at Berkeley. A federal appeals court judge cited it a few years ago to show that execution by hanging was inherently \"cruel and unusual\". Khallil Abdul Muhammad, Louis Farrakhan's notoriously anti-Semitic disciple and maestro of the Million Man March, has quoted it in speeches assailing American racism - unaware, apparently, that the song was written by a white Jewish schoolteacher from New York City named Abel Meeropol. Meeropol, who wrote under the pen name Lewis Allan, did not write the song for Holiday; and yet so completely did Holiday come to own Strange Fruit that Meeropol spent half a lifetime reminding people that it was really his creation, and his alone. Few people seemed to be able to accept that so potent a song could come from so prosaic a source. Newspaper articles saddled Meeropol with a range of purported collaborators. \"One Lewis Allen [sic] is cited as the author of Strange Fruit, but did he compose both words and music?\" the composer and diarist Ned Rorem, a passionate Holiday devotee, wrote in the New York Times in 1995, nine years after Meeropol's death. \"Indeed, who was he? Was he black?\" (To the organisers of a celebration of black composers at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in 1999, the answer was yes, for they included Strange Fruit on the programme.) In a way, Meeropol sealed his own fate, his status as a historical footnote, when he decided that it was Billie Holiday to whom he'd bring the song: she made it her own more effectively than any other artist ever could have. \"When you listen to her, it's almost like an audio tape of her autobiography,\" said Tony Bennett. \"She didn't sing anything unless she had lived it.\" Holiday was only 24 years old in 1939, but she had already experienced enough prejudice and despair by then to call herself a \"race woman\".

In the spring of 1947 she checked into a New York hospital for detoxification. A few months later, in Philadelphia, she was busted and spent nearly a year in a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania. With every increment of abuse Holiday endured, Strange Fruit became more personal to her. The confidence with which she'd first sung it gave way to pure pathos. Watching her undertake it could be both exhilarating and excruciating. Even decades later, the experience of listening to and watching her perform Strange Fruit - eyes closed and head back, the familiar gardenia over her ear, fingers snapping lightly - lingered in many memories. The actress Billie Allen Henderson recalled how, during Holiday's appearance at New York's Birdland in 1952, the maitre d' actually confiscated all cigarettes before Holiday began singing it. \"I was standing there with my date when she started singing this song,\" she recalled. \"I was trying to be sophisticated and all of a sudden something stabs me in the solar plexus and I was gasping for air. It was so deeply felt. I understood it_ I could smell the burning flesh; I felt it. She was . . . unrelenting is a good word for it. Some didn't know how to react. They weren't quite sure. Nobody stirred. It was startling, and I'll never forget it. I thought, 'That's what art can do.'\" In The Heart of a Woman, Maya Angelou recounts how, during a visit to Los Angeles in 1958, Holiday sang Strange Fruit to Angelou's young son, Guy. Billie talked and sang in a hoarse, dry tone the well-known protest song. Her rasping voice and phrasing literally enchanted me. I saw the black bodies hanging from the Southern trees. I saw the lynch victims' blood glide from the leaves down the trunks and on to the roots. Guy interrupted: \"How can there be blood at the root?\" I made a hard face and warned him, \"Shut up, Guy, just listen.\" Billie had continued under the interruption, her voice vibrating over harsh edges. She painted a picture of a lovely land, pastoral and bucolic, then added eyes bulged and mouths twisted, onto the Southern landscape. Guy broke into her song. \"What's a pastoral scene, Miss Holiday?\" Billie looked up slowly and studied Guy for a second. Her face became cruel, and when she spoke her voice was scornful. \"It means when the crackers are killing the niggers. It means when they take a little nigger like you and snatch off his nuts and shove them down his goddam throat. That's what it means.\" The thrust of the rage repelled Guy and stunned me. Billie continued: \"That's what they do. That's a goddamn pastoral scene.\" Holiday performed it again in London in February 1959, in a televised concert that has since been excerpted in several documentaries. Haggard, largely wasted away, she had grown oddly, sadly suited to capture the full grotesqueness of the song. Now she not only sang of bulging eyes and twisted mouths. She embodied them. Holiday died in July that year, aged 44. Meeropol died in 1986, in a Jewish nursing home near Springfield, Massachusetts. Strange Fruit was sung at his memorial service. To some, the song remains too hot to handle. In the 1980s, a disc jockey in North Carolina came across a collection of Billie Holiday standards in the station's library. Strange Fruit was circled, with the admonitions \"Watch\" and \"Do not play\" printed next to it. And when Robert Meeropol, Abel's younger son, flew on United Airlines a couple of years ago, he noticed that Cassandra Wilson's album New Moon Daughter was among the in-flight entertainment, but that its first cut - Strange Fruit - was missing. \u00a9 David Margolick.

      "bodyText": "The UK's reputation as a dance nation has been confirmed, with Mixmag storming up the music magazine circulation charts with a 47.1% year-on-year increase. The Emap dance music magazine turned in a 106,111 circulation in the new Audit Bureau of Circulations figures for July to December 2000. This is up from the 72,115 figure recorded for the same period the previous year. Mixmag increased sales 10% period on period from 96,483 in June. While the success of Mixmag outstripped other music titles, it set the tone for an upbeat set of results across the board. The two other dance titles, Ministry and Muzik, both held steady. Ministry, the magazine from the Ministry of Sound clubbing empire, lost 5.1% of its circulation period on period to 90,235. However, it recorded an 8.1% increase year on year. IPC's Muzik remained stable compared with the second half of 1999. However, the title regained the sales it lost in the first six months of last year with a 9.1% period-on-period increase to 43,748. In the heavy metal sector, Emap's Kerrang! reaped the benefits of a relaunch that has broadened its focus from pure rock to all kinds of alternative, guitar-based music. Kerrang! recorded an 11.6% year-on-year increase in circulation to 47,004. In the rock sector, all eyes were on NME after IPC closed its 73-year-old stablemate Melody Maker at the end of last year. The veteran title recorded an 8.2% period-on-period decline to 70,003, with 8% of that drop taking place in the past six months. IPC Music &amp; Sport managing director Mike Soutar said the company intended to continue broadening the appeal of NME. \"The dominance of dance music magazine continues,\" he said. \"But NME has about a 40% command of all the rock magazines sold in the UK and our plans are to look at the options of being the only weekly in the market,\" said Mr Soutar. \"We have a new editor in Ben Knowles and, with the rock and hip-hop crossover, NME has fortunately found a type of dance music that's acceptable to cover.

Q, Emap's music glossy for the mainstream rock fan, regained ground lost in the first six months of last year, recording a 13.7% increase period on period to achieve a 204,014 circulation figure. Year on year, Q dropped 3.4%. Mojo, the company's other music magazine, increased its circulation by 5% year on year to 84,010.

The Premier League has refused to reveal the identity of the bidders, but Budweiser, Pepsi and now Coke have all pulled out of negotiations. A source close to talks said the winning brand was likely to \"come as some surprise\" to the business world. There is still speculation that current sponsor Carling, which stormed out of negotiations at the beginning of the year, may yet renew its eight-year relationship with the league. It is thought that a technology brand is in the running. Carling's existing four-year deal cost it around \u00a327m annually and the new deal is thought to be worth at least \u00a345m. However the size of the bid is no longer believed to be the issue. One source said that the Premier League is \"selecting\" a brand that best fits its own global marketing strategy.

      "bodyText": "Calls to introduce US-style 24-hour courts in Britain, today received a cautious welcome from civil rights and legal groups. Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens urged the introduction of round-the-clock courts in London and other cities to fast-track offenders through the criminal justice system. The civil rights group Liberty said that it supported the idea, provided it did not compromise justice. The Magistrates' Association echoed that cautious welcome, saying that getting defendants into preliminary hearings as soon as possible after they were arrested would be beneficial. Sir John said that he had seen the 24-hour courts system in operation in New York and believed it could work here. He told the Times newspaper: \"I have seen it in New York and it works. \"When [people] are arrested they go straight to court, whatever the time, day or night. It saves time. It allows you to process them in a far, far quicker way. \"Some of these persistent offenders, these youngsters, society quite honestly needs a rest from them.\" Home secretary Jack Straw was \"very keen\" on the idea or a similar way of tackling persistent young offenders, Sir John said. The government promised to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders from 142 to 71 days. But recent figures showed that the average in October last year was 94 days. Magistrates' Association chairman Harold Mawdsley said that he welcomed the proposal, but he voiced concerns over magistrates sentencing people at \"two in the morning\", when they might not be able to concentrate properly. However, he added that getting defendants through a preliminary hearing as quickly as possible was a good thing. Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe said she believed the 24-hour courts could be a good idea, but called on the government to work closely with the police to avoid making the system too bureaucratic. Sid Brighton, the chief executive of the Justices' Clerks Society, said the possibility of 24-hour courts had been talked about some years ago but never really got off the ground. Potential difficulties would include costs, staffing levels and availability, Mr Brighton said, adding that the majority of people were already taken before a court within 24 hours of arrest. The Home Office refused to confirm or deny that 24-hour courts were being considered, but it said an ongoing review of the criminal justice system could lead to \"radical changes\" for the courts. Magistrates' courts could already sit during the night or at the weekend if they choose to do so, the Home Office said.

      "body": "<p>Yvette Cooper, one of Labour's rising stars, is to become the first government minister in Britain to take maternity leave. </p> <p>In a move hailed last night by maternity rights campaigners, Ms Cooper, the public health minister, announced that she will take 18 weeks leave on full pay when she gives birth to her second child, which is due in August. </p> <p>Ms Cooper, 31, who is married to Ed Balls, Gordon Brown's closest adviser, plans to stop working in July. She will return to work by the end of the year. After discussions with the health secretary Alan Milburn, she will take her maternity leave in line with Department of Health guidelines. Civil servants in the department are entitled to 18 weeks leave on full pay. Ms Cooper will therefore continue to draw her salary of \u00a376,657 while she is on leave. </p> <p>This is more generous than women's statutory rights. By law women are entitled to 40 weeks' maternity leave, 18 of which is paid - six weeks at 90% at full pay and 12 weeks at \u00a360.20p a week. Mr Balls, 33, who is the treasury's chief economic adviser, will take paternity leave, as he did when their first child was born. </p> <p>Ms Cooper, MP for Pontefract and Castleford, said yesterday that she was planning to have her baby at the NHS hospital in her constituency where she had her first child, Meriel, who is 20 months old. \"We are planning to have the baby in Pontefract,\" Ms Cooper said. \"The NHS staff there were wonderful to us last time round.\" </p> <p>Maternity rights campaigners last night congratulated Ms Cooper for setting a good example to employees and employers alike. </p> <p>Joanna Wade, a spokeswoman for the Maternity Alliance, said: \"It is good to know that she feels confident enough to be up front that she will be taking time off. We strongly hope that this will set an example to high level employees that there are times when family has to come before work and mothers should not be punished for that.\" </p> <p>Ms Cooper's announcement came as ministers finalise details of a government review of parental rights. They are expected to approve an increase in statutory maternity pay and in the amount of time mothers are allowed to take off work. </p> <p>Campaigners are hoping that Tony Blair, who took two week's paternity leave after the birth of Leo last year, will endorse radical changes. Ms Wade said: \"We are very hopeful, but there is a danger that the changes may not be as wholehearted as we would have liked to see.\" </p> <p>Ms Cooper is regarded as one of the brightest stars in the government who is favoured by both the Blair and Brown camps. A former journalist, she was appointed to the frontline post of public health minister in 1999, two years after her election to parliament.</p>",

Civil servants in the department are entitled to 18 weeks leave on full pay. Ms Cooper will therefore continue to draw her salary of \u00a376,657 while she is on leave. This is more generous than women's statutory rights. By law women are entitled to 40 weeks' maternity leave, 18 of which is paid - six weeks at 90% at full pay and 12 weeks at \u00a360.20p a week. Mr Balls, 33, who is the treasury's chief economic adviser, will take paternity leave, as he did when their first child was born. Ms Cooper, MP for Pontefract and Castleford, said yesterday that she was planning to have her baby at the NHS hospital in her constituency where she had her first child, Meriel, who is 20 months old. \"We are planning to have the baby in Pontefract,\" Ms Cooper said. \"The NHS staff there were wonderful to us last time round.\" Maternity rights campaigners last night congratulated Ms Cooper for setting a good example to employees and employers alike. Joanna Wade, a spokeswoman for the Maternity Alliance, said: \"It is good to know that she feels confident enough to be up front that she will be taking time off. We strongly hope that this will set an example to high level employees that there are times when family has to come before work and mothers should not be punished for that.\" Ms Cooper's announcement came as ministers finalise details of a government review of parental rights. They are expected to approve an increase in statutory maternity pay and in the amount of time mothers are allowed to take off work. Campaigners are hoping that Tony Blair, who took two week's paternity leave after the birth of Leo last year, will endorse radical changes. Ms Wade said: \"We are very hopeful, but there is a danger that the changes may not be as wholehearted as we would have liked to see.\" Ms Cooper is regarded as one of the brightest stars in the government who is favoured by both the Blair and Brown camps. A former journalist, she was appointed to the frontline post of public health minister in 1999, two years after her election to parliament.",

Boho serves absurdly cheap grub - spot-on grilled trout at \u00a35.50; steak with rosemary potatoes came to \u00a310 . Salads can be a little too Mr Sainsbury's, the potatoes could do with less fat, and vegetarians get short shrift. Actually, they get no shrift at all.

The rice is suffused with cardamom. </p> <p><strong> Verdict:</strong> Easy to cook, took the 10 minutes promised on the packaging and the portions are generous. The chicken was tender and rather tasty, and the rice unusually good for something from the chiller cabinet. Even the goo was good.

The Cornish Yarg, the Ashed Golden Cross and the Kirkham's Lancashire are all fantabulous. For those of you who are still foxed, there are plenty of cheeseboard selections available. Not to mention biscuits, hampers, pickles and wine. Delivery: Next-day delivery available for orders placed before 12 o'clock. Charges: \u00a35.95 p&amp;p. Just out Patak's Jaipuri Chicken Jalfrezi Form: Two containers, one of ghee, marinated chicken bits, vegetables, and Jalfrezi goo; the other with rice and bay leaves. Flavour: It says medium hot, but it's medium rather than hot; distinctive, fresh spicing with one spice (fenugreek?) rather dominant. The rice is suffused with cardamom. Verdict: Easy to cook, took the 10 minutes promised on the packaging and the portions are generous. The chicken was tender and rather tasty, and the rice unusually good for something from the chiller cabinet. Even the goo was good. There was an over-dominant something, which skewed the flavour somewhat, but it tasted fresh and lively Cost: \u00a33.99 for 1kg. The taste test: Greek-style yoghurt (or the real thing) Real Greek yoghurt is made from sheep's milk rather than cow's (responsible for most of these) and by the fat content - 6g per 100g for sheep, 10-15g per 100g for cows Brand: Sainsbury Authentic Greek Yoghurt Price: \u00a30.45/150g What it's like: Sheep's milk gives it a fresh edge. How it rates: ***** Brand: Waitrose Greek Style Price: \u00a30.31/150g What it's like: Rich stuff, marked acidity; soft, creamy, texture. How it rates: **** Brand: Somerfield Greek Style Price: \u00a30.59/200g What it's like: Light, bright and easy to eat. How it rates: **** Brand: M&amp;S Price: \u00a30.59/200g What it's like: Quite solid, chalky, ultra mild. Rating: *** Brand: Tesco Greek Style Price: \u00a31.35/500g What it's like: Long on texture (creamy); short on flavour (well-mannered). Rating: ***",

      "bodyText": "The future of German media group EM.TV is hanging in the balance following the resignation of Nickolaus Becker, the chairman of the company's supervisory board. He has quit in protest at a last-minute rescue deal, agreed yesterday with EM.TV's German rival Kirch. This deal could, in any case, be scuppered by formula one tycoon Bernie Ecclestone. In addition to Mr Becker, several senior figures within EM.TV are known to be opposed to the rescue package as it gives Kirch a 16% stake in the company. EM.TV chief executive Thomas Haffa brokered the deal. Mr Ecclestone is threatening to exercise his right to veto the deal between Kirch and EM.TV. Kirch yesterday agreed to bail out EM.TV by buying half of its 50% stake in formula one holding company SLEC for \u00a3380m, plus a 16% stake in the struggling German group. SLEC is controlled by Mr Ecclestone, which gives him the power to block the deal. EM.TV appeared to be in the dark this morning about Mr Ecclestone's opposition to the agreement, claiming it had received no notification from SLEC. \"We have just seen the reports and, as far as we know, there has been no phone conversation between Mr Haffa and Mr Ecclestone,\" said a spokeswoman for EM.TV. This contradicted Mr Ecclestone's claim that both EM.TV and Kirch have been notified of SLEC's opposition to the deal. EM.TV needs the green light for the Kirch package, as it is struggling to pay off a \u00a3680m debt burden created by a wave of acquisitions last year. There are also doubts over Kirch's ability to raise the \u00a31bn needed to finance the rescue deal, which includes buying a further 25% of SLEC under the terms of a shareholding agreement signed between Mr Ecclestone and EM.TV.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Gordon Brown speech to Labour Spring Conference, February 16, 2000</p> <p>Friends, we meet here in Glasgow in a week that we have seen unemployment fall to its lowest level for 25 years; inflation down to its lowest level for 30 years; long term interest rates down to their lowest level for 35 years; mortgage payments, lower under Labour, \u00a31000 lower under Labour than under the Tories. </p> <p>Instead of the miseries of boom and bust which wrecked people's lives under the Tories, with Labour: the confidence in 2001 of economic stability within which businesses and hard-working families can plan ahead. </p> <p>And more than one million men and women denied work under the Tories now in jobs under Labour. </p> <p>With stability Labour now the natural party of economic competence in Britain, just as with our minimum wage, one million children out of poverty, rising pensioners incomes we are the natural party in government of social justice too. </p> <p>Friends, they said of us here that in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales, legislate a minimum wage, give a statutory right to trade union membership and recognition and take a million children out of poverty. But this we have done and more as public investment, halved under the Conservatives is now doubling under Labour. </p> <p>But for us these achievements mark not the end of our journey; these steps are just the beginning. </p> <p>As befits the Labour Party and our high ideals, our thoughts are not on the past but on the future. </p> <p>Not on achievements won but on long term goals we are determined to reach. </p> <p>And after four years of government under Tony Blair's leadership, I believe that we as a party gather here today more idealistic, more optimistic and more determined to implement in government our Labour values of justice and fairness. </p> <p>And we know that, as this generation of party members, a historic opportunity is granted to us: an opportunity never given to those at the end of the first term in the governments of '24, '29, '64, '74 and even 1945. </p> <p>For the first time as a government able to make the case for a second term with employment increasing; for the first time able to make the case for a second term with public investment rising; for the first time able to make the case from a foundation of stability. </p> <p>An unprecedented opportunity because having put the economic foundations in place, we are now, building with confidence, able to raise our sights to more ambitious and indeed more challenging goals that are our party's ideals and the next steps for Britain. </p> <p>As long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our work is not yet done. </p> <p>As long as rising prosperity bypasses a single community or a single family our work is not yet done. </p> <p>As long as there is opportunity denied in education or enterprise our work is not yet done. </p> <p>And as long as our public services need investment and modernisation our work is not yet done. </p> <p>And friends we can rededicate ourselves to the task ahead because the Labour party thanks to your efforts has never been stronger and I want to start by thanking all of you, our councillors in local government, our women's organisations, our young people's organisations, all elected representatives - for the work you do. </p> <p>But our starting point, Labour's starting point, indeed the precondition for progress, the foundation for our future, for rising living standards, is economic stability. Now in the past Labour governments have spent the first two years spending and because in 1966 and in 1976 they had not built the foundations for stability they were forced to retrench and cut back in their third and fourth years. </p> <p>I know that some people thought it was a mistake to take the tough approach to spending in our first two years. But we were right to put stability first. </p> <p>It was the tough decisions which we took, however unpopular, that have made it possible to keep interest rates low, to cut unemployment, cut child poverty by one million and now to raise spending on the NHS, schools, policing and transport sustainably year on year. </p> <p>And I tell this conference as our manifesto for the next term will say that it is only by maintaining these tough disciplines and rejecting a return to the stop go quick fix short-termist indiscipline of the Tory years that we will rise to the challenges of a second term. </p> <p>And when the Tories now tell us that low inflation, low interest rates and low borrowing are nothing to do with the decisions of this government, let us ask them: if it was so easy to keep interest rates and inflation low why did Tory policies give us 15% interest rates, 11% inflation, a \u00a350bn deficit and why did they repeatedly plunge Britain into boom and bust? </p> <p>We all know what this meant for the British people: unaffordable mortgage rates, mounting credit card debts, negative equity and even the threat of repossessions, for businesses, cuts in investments, fewer jobs, less in wages, greater insecurity. </p> <p>And we know what economic stability means for millions of British families around the country, including families like those with us today the Farnhams from Renfrewshire and the Beresfords from the north-east of England - low interest rates, low inflation and rising living standards. </p> <p>It was not by chance but by choice, making the Bank of England independent and tough fiscal rules, not by accident but by our actions, that Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s, standards of living are rising, and instead of isolated in Europe we are winning for Britain in Europe. </p> <p>And let the country be in no doubt that if the Tories came back so too would Tory boom and bust. Because their free market short-termist dogma would ensure a repeat of the very same mistakes - tax cuts they cannot afford, based on spending cuts they will not identify, a neglect of investment they cannot justify, based on the absence of any fiscal rules, all driven by short-termist dogma, the all-too-familiar ingredients of traditional Tory boom and bust. </p> <p>So I can say today that the Budget will lock in the tough fiscal stance I set out in last year's Budget and pre-Budget report. Yes to responsible tax cuts where affordable - for families, pensioners, savings and investment. But there will be no return to the irresponsible pre-election give-aways of the past. </p> <p>And I say of the budget and of a second term that unlike the Tories with their irresponsible, unfunded, unaffordable and unbelievable tax promises that simply do not add up but threaten boom and bust, nothing we do will put stability or essential public services at risk. </p> <p>So when it comes to the economic fundamentals and people ask what is the next step, I say in the first term we have put stability first. In the second term we will put stability first. Every term of a Labour government will put stability first. </p> <p>And the reason we put stability first, the reason I have always said our prudence is for a purpose, is that it is through achieving stability that we can reach higher in a radical second term of achievement for our country and meet five challenging economic goals that will be at the heart of our budget decisions and in our manifesto for the coming decade: </p> <p>\u0095 First to reach for full employment <br>\u0095 Second prosperity for all by closing the productivity gap<br> \u0095 Third the majority of the young going to college or university <br>\u0095 Fourth ensuring not just some but all children have the best start in life as we eradicate child poverty; and <br>\u0095 Fifth meeting peoples rising expectations by delivering the best public services that everyone can rely on. </p> <p>Five radical economic goals for our generation, built on a foundation of stability and economic competence, all born out of our movement's central, driving ideal - that opportunity and security should not be just for a few but for all. </p> <p>First employment. </p> <p>I know the damage unemployment does. </p> <p>I remember my father telling me of working in this city in the 1930s in an era remembered for unemployed men standing on street corners when they wanted to work. </p> <p>I grew up in a mining area where once there were once 66 pits which closures by closure were reduced to just one. </p> <p>For me since the time I went to school and grew up around a mining community and for a whole generation our political life has been dominated by unemployment - long term unemployment, youth unemployment, the fear of unemployment, the consequences of unemployment, the poverty caused by unemployment. </p> <p>Since 1997, 1.1m jobs created, more people in work than ever before. But now is not the time for complacency or relaxing our efforts. And I tell this conference that in the coming election we will seek from the British people a mandate to create and then sustain full employment over the next decade. And not just in one region but all regions of our country. </p> <p>Already youth unemployment cut by over 75%, now the lowest since 1974. 500,000 on training or in work. But we are not satisfied. While stage one of our new deal was to link young people to the jobs, stage two is even bolder - to coach, encourage, train, motivate and yes to ask responsibility from those who are hard to employ who are still left behind but whom we need back to work both for them and because it is the best anti-deprivation, anti-crime, anti-vandalism, anti-poverty policy in our country. </p> <p>Long-term unemployment cut by two thirds, now the lowest since the 1970s. </p> <p>But we are not satisfied. </p> <p>That is why the next stage in the next term is to match the unemployed without jobs to the skills shortages that need action and I call on employers to join us in sector by sector initiatives to meet skill shortages in IT, construction, retail and financial services industries. </p> <p>Having raised lone parent employment from 44% to over 50%, we have yet more to do to reach our target of 70%. So in April, instead of the Tory policy of abolishing the New Deal for Lone Parents, I call on the whole country to support our new policy - training, interviews, advice and help for lone parents to find work - backed up by the doubling of investment from this year in our national child care strategy. The best and surest way of tackling child poverty in our country. </p> <p>And because the problems of our high unemployment areas will not be solved by benefit cheques or by property subsidies but require more enterprises and the opportunity for enterprise open to all, now and for the next Parliament I challenge every business leader to see our inner cities and old industrial estates not as no-go areas for business but as areas of huge untapped potential and consider investing and hiring unemployed men and women. </p> <p>In a new partnership for progress the next step is to ensure - as Labour will pledge itself at the election to do - that for people work pays. Our minimum wage, the historic achievement won not by the government but by your efforts, a statutory national minimum wage. </p> <p>And let us remember also, the minimum wage will never be safe under a Tory government. </p> <p>And as we examine the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission and improve the Working Families Tax Credit, we set a task for the next Parliament: we will continue to build a fairer tax system for the low paid, so that the principle of the WFTC that has made work pay for families with children will be extended to those without children too. </p> <p>And because education and skills are the key to opportunity and our economic future, the next election manifesto will seek also a new ambitious mandate to remove the old barriers to educational opportunity and access to colleges and universities. </p> <p>The reason I, like David Blunkett, am concerned not just about nursery education and standards in the schools but higher staying on rates and wider access to college and university, is that I remember my school classes of the 1960s when it was for only a fraction of young people that a university place was available. </p> <p>It was a scandal of wasted potential. </p> <p>And I see today that there are still thousands of young people who have the ability and should have the chances that I and others were able to enjoy. </p> <p>It was a scandal of wasted potential then and it is still a scandal now. So in the interests of the country's economy as well as individual students, it is time to take the next step so that not just a minority have access to higher and further education but for the first time a majority - and we will do so not by quotas but by investing in educational maintenance allowances worth up to \u00a330 a week for staying on at school, and through summer schools and opening up recruitment, widening access so that our colleges and universities can draw on the widest possible pool of talent. </p> <p>We want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to but the potential you were born with. But our hard won and newly won stability allows us to set an even more challenging goal. </p> <p>Child poverty is a scar on the soul of Britain. Children two or three years old, for whom, without action, we know life never will be fair, destined to fail even before their lives journey has begun and whom it is our duty to help. Child benefit already up 30%. </p> <p>Under the Tories, child benefit, \u00a311 a week. Under Labour, child benefit and the new children's tax credit, \u00a324 a week , twice as much, and for some, \u00a350 a week. </p> <p>One million children taken out of poverty but that is only the start. </p> <p>Our next reform: an integrated child credit, a seamless system of family support, built on universal child benefit. </p> <p>So we will seek a very specific mandate from the people of this country to take the next million children out of poverty, to halve child poverty by 2010 and abolish it in a generation. </p> <p>But let us be clear about the new thinking for the next term because we need care as well as cash, the war against child poverty cannot be won by government national and local alone, only by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable, community and public sectors working together. </p> <p>So in the next Parliament as we expand Sure Start, support community initiatives with the children's fund, toughen up the responsibilities we demand of absent parents, and encourage a new alliance for children, let us make it our mission in every community of our country - as councillors, party members, concerned parents - to bring together and mobilise all the forces of care and compassion so that in this country in our generation we end the shame of child poverty and ensure that no child is left behind, every child the best possible start in life. </p> <p>And our hard won stability is the foundation for achieving another historic Labour goal - to abolish pensioner poverty and ensure every elderly citizen enjoys a rising share in the standard of living of our country. </p> <p>When we came to power our first priority was to tackle pensioner poverty - persistent disabling often hidden poverty especially amongst widows over 75 whose husband had left little or no occupational pension, who had no savings but who under the Tories had only \u00a371 a week to live on, but from April as a result of the priority agreed for tackling pensioner poverty will have \u00a392 a week and then \u00a3100 a week, nearly half as much again as in 1997. </p> <p>And because we must be the voice for those weakest, frailest and most vulnerable citizens who are often least able to use their voice, let us tell the country that it was right - and is right - to take the poorest pensioners out of poverty first. </p> <p>And now having made this start, we propose the next step for the next parliament - to raise the incomes of middle and low income pensioners. </p> <p>Building on the winter allowance, free TV licences for the over 75s, raising the basic pension by \u00a35 and \u00a38, let us tell the country about our new pension credit, a tax and benefit reform that for middle and low income pensioners - for couples with pension incomes of \u00a310,000 or less - will reward saving and ensure higher incomes than they would receive even from an earnings link. </p> <p>And let us tell the country also of the Tories' plans. </p> <p>Even in their disarray over pensions, the same Tory party that did nothing for 20 years about pensioner poverty, still want to abolish the winter allowance, remove free TV licenses and even scrap the Christmas bonus. And we must make it our cause that this should never happen. Let us tell every pensioner in the country of our next steps - a guarantee for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty; for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them; and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country. And let our next step be to build from our new found and hard won stability not just the most basic services, but build over this generation the best public services, services that we can be proud of. Let me be clear - every opportunity we have had - the best schooling, the best of health care when ill, for many of us the best chances at university, - every opportunity we have enjoyed owes its origin to the decisions of past Labour governments, decisions we made as a Labour party to expand education from the few to the many, to create a welfare state that takes the shame out of need and to fund a National Health Service open to all. And it is only because some people have forgotten the chaos, the unreliable pre war voluntary, charitable and private provision that they can contemplate a return to privatised health and basic services. Friends let us tell the country that the contrast between Labour and the Conservatives is starker than it has ever been. It is between Labour who wants to invest, modernise and reform the public services - doubling public investment: education spending rising at 5% a year; health spending at 6% a year; and a 50% rise in transport spending over the coming four years. </p> <p>And the Tories who want to privatise, break up and fragment them. And in this battle over the future of public services, we will ask people to reject the Tory way of cutting public investment and spending and undermining our public services and instead ask for a mandate for the New Labour way, investing more in return for clear output targets and delivery. </p> <p>It is by departments realising they should devolve downwards to a local level and by local government securing flexibility and finance in return for reform and results that we will do best. In our first term we had to set a new national framework, a national framework for stability, employment and public services and tax. In the second term to achieve our goals, full employment, better public services and ending child poverty, we need to devolve power from the centre to regions and local communities. So over the next two years the number of local Public Service Agreements matching resources to output targets signed with local authorities will rise from 20 to 150 and just as for the Regional Development Agencies we have granted more flexibility with more finance, so too with local government we will match that with further steps towards greater flexibility: flexibility in return for reform and resources. </p> <p>I want people to see what we do together as a Labour commitment to the renaissance of local government in our country. </p> <p>So ours is a battle to demonstrate that in the 21st century, we can build strong modern locally run public services that people can rely on. </p> <p>And to win that battle, we must defeat not just political conservatism, but another form of conservatism - and more insidious - cynicism. </p> <p>Reading every day the Tory press releases they are not really trying to win voters' approval they are simply trying to win voters' apathy. </p> <p>The cynics who try to make people believe that governments can never make a difference, that all politicians are just out for themselves, that the only form of public service is self service, that politics never be a force for good. </p> <p>When they say governments always fail and that governments can do no good, their aim is to subvert the decent, progressive instincts of the British people and to defeat the very idea of a progressive public purpose. </p> <p>But to those cynical about public service and public action let us tell them that there are great causes both at home, and all across the world that are worth fighting for. </p> <p>Tomorrow at the G7 meeting of finance ministers we will discuss the next steps in the campaign that Clare Short has led - our duties as industrial countries to lift the crippling burden of third world debt. </p> <p>In building a virtuous circle of debt relief poverty reduction and sustainable development, let us set and meet challenging targets for the year 2015. Instead of one child in every seven dying before the age of five, calling on the pharmaceutical companies and all governments to join us in widening access to life saving drugs and health care and eradicating avoidable infant deaths. Instead of 120 million children denied education every child in primary education. Instead of 1 billion condemned to poverty halving poverty by 2015. And to speed up this process, we will ask the IMF, the World Bank the developed countries and developing countries, churches, charities, companies to forge a plan so that targets set are targets met, goals agreed are goals achieved. And I can tell you today that to lead that goal so that no child is left behind, every child a decent start in life, at our international children's conference on February 26th, Nelson Mandela will inaugurate this new global initiative, worthy of both a second term and our values. Let us answer the cynics by our actions, showing that when governments intervene to tackle injustice they are not violating rights, they are righting wrongs. Let us show that Labour exists not for itself but for larger and noble purposes - what we can achieve for this country and one world. Let us tell the country why we are New Labour, not just by upbringing and custom, but by conviction and belief. We are Labour because we believe that we are not simply self interested individuals, isolated and sufficient unto ourselves, Labour because we are men and women who feel, however distantly, the pain of others, who believe in something bigger than ourselves. Citizens with mutual needs, linked destinies and - yes - shared values, who in Robert Kennedy's words, see suffering and seek to heal it, see pain and seek to end it, see injustice and seek to overcome it, see prejudice and seek to triumph over it. Let us tell the people that it is when politics fail and governments walk away that children are malnourished and too many more are undereducated, that men and women go without jobs and many others are never able to move ahead, that pensioners die in poverty and too many struggle month after month to make ends meet, that public squalor exists alongside private affluence and potential is left unrealized. It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that all can begin to have opportunity and no one is left out. It is when politics succeed and governments engage that all our people have the chance to make the most of themselves and no one and no area is excluded. </p> <p>It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that economic growth and economic justice advance together and rising growth will deliver rising living standards for all. </p> <p>People say Labour's great moment was in the past, in 1945. Others say our great modern triumph was May 1997. </p> <p>But I say again, we have only just begun. </p> <p>And to those same people who say Labour's place in history is assured by winning a second term, I say, it is victory with a mandate Labour seeks. </p> <p>Let us pledge that for our generation our Party's place in history will be measured not just in votes, seats or majorities but in better lives for people who may never know us but whose security and opportunities will as a result of our common endeavour be transformed. </p> <p>Let us have confidence that this great Party, whose roots are in the past but whose faith is in the future, can meet new needs, tackle the great injustices, open up new opportunities and give new life to people's hopes. </p> <p>Let us be the generation that abolished child and pensioner poverty built modern public services, created full employment and took the next steps to prosperity for all. </p> <p>Causes worth fighting for. </p> <p>Let us seize our opportunity </p> <p>And let us use it well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown speech to Labour Spring Conference, February 16, 2000 Friends, we meet here in Glasgow in a week that we have seen unemployment fall to its lowest level for 25 years; inflation down to its lowest level for 30 years; long term interest rates down to their lowest level for 35 years; mortgage payments, lower under Labour, \u00a31000 lower under Labour than under the Tories. Instead of the miseries of boom and bust which wrecked people's lives under the Tories, with Labour: the confidence in 2001 of economic stability within which businesses and hard-working families can plan ahead. And more than one million men and women denied work under the Tories now in jobs under Labour. With stability Labour now the natural party of economic competence in Britain, just as with our minimum wage, one million children out of poverty, rising pensioners incomes we are the natural party in government of social justice too. Friends, they said of us here that in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales, legislate a minimum wage, give a statutory right to trade union membership and recognition and take a million children out of poverty. But this we have done and more as public investment, halved under the Conservatives is now doubling under Labour. But for us these achievements mark not the end of our journey; these steps are just the beginning. As befits the Labour Party and our high ideals, our thoughts are not on the past but on the future. Not on achievements won but on long term goals we are determined to reach. And after four years of government under Tony Blair's leadership, I believe that we as a party gather here today more idealistic, more optimistic and more determined to implement in government our Labour values of justice and fairness. And we know that, as this generation of party members, a historic opportunity is granted to us: an opportunity never given to those at the end of the first term in the governments of '24, '29, '64, '74 and even 1945. For the first time as a government able to make the case for a second term with employment increasing; for the first time able to make the case for a second term with public investment rising; for the first time able to make the case from a foundation of stability. An unprecedented opportunity because having put the economic foundations in place, we are now, building with confidence, able to raise our sights to more ambitious and indeed more challenging goals that are our party's ideals and the next steps for Britain. As long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our work is not yet done. As long as rising prosperity bypasses a single community or a single family our work is not yet done. As long as there is opportunity denied in education or enterprise our work is not yet done. And as long as our public services need investment and modernisation our work is not yet done. And friends we can rededicate ourselves to the task ahead because the Labour party thanks to your efforts has never been stronger and I want to start by thanking all of you, our councillors in local government, our women's organisations, our young people's organisations, all elected representatives - for the work you do. But our starting point, Labour's starting point, indeed the precondition for progress, the foundation for our future, for rising living standards, is economic stability. Now in the past Labour governments have spent the first two years spending and because in 1966 and in 1976 they had not built the foundations for stability they were forced to retrench and cut back in their third and fourth years. I know that some people thought it was a mistake to take the tough approach to spending in our first two years. But we were right to put stability first. It was the tough decisions which we took, however unpopular, that have made it possible to keep interest rates low, to cut unemployment, cut child poverty by one million and now to raise spending on the NHS, schools, policing and transport sustainably year on year. And I tell this conference as our manifesto for the next term will say that it is only by maintaining these tough disciplines and rejecting a return to the stop go quick fix short-termist indiscipline of the Tory years that we will rise to the challenges of a second term. And when the Tories now tell us that low inflation, low interest rates and low borrowing are nothing to do with the decisions of this government, let us ask them: if it was so easy to keep interest rates and inflation low why did Tory policies give us 15% interest rates, 11% inflation, a \u00a350bn deficit and why did they repeatedly plunge Britain into boom and bust? We all know what this meant for the British people: unaffordable mortgage rates, mounting credit card debts, negative equity and even the threat of repossessions, for businesses, cuts in investments, fewer jobs, less in wages, greater insecurity. And we know what economic stability means for millions of British families around the country, including families like those with us today the Farnhams from Renfrewshire and the Beresfords from the north-east of England - low interest rates, low inflation and rising living standards. It was not by chance but by choice, making the Bank of England independent and tough fiscal rules, not by accident but by our actions, that Britain now has the best combination of low interest rates, low inflation and low unemployment since the 1960s, standards of living are rising, and instead of isolated in Europe we are winning for Britain in Europe. And let the country be in no doubt that if the Tories came back so too would Tory boom and bust. Because their free market short-termist dogma would ensure a repeat of the very same mistakes - tax cuts they cannot afford, based on spending cuts they will not identify, a neglect of investment they cannot justify, based on the absence of any fiscal rules, all driven by short-termist dogma, the all-too-familiar ingredients of traditional Tory boom and bust. So I can say today that the Budget will lock in the tough fiscal stance I set out in last year's Budget and pre-Budget report. Yes to responsible tax cuts where affordable - for families, pensioners, savings and investment. But there will be no return to the irresponsible pre-election give-aways of the past. And I say of the budget and of a second term that unlike the Tories with their irresponsible, unfunded, unaffordable and unbelievable tax promises that simply do not add up but threaten boom and bust, nothing we do will put stability or essential public services at risk. So when it comes to the economic fundamentals and people ask what is the next step, I say in the first term we have put stability first. In the second term we will put stability first. Every term of a Labour government will put stability first. And the reason we put stability first, the reason I have always said our prudence is for a purpose, is that it is through achieving stability that we can reach higher in a radical second term of achievement for our country and meet five challenging economic goals that will be at the heart of our budget decisions and in our manifesto for the coming decade: \u0095 First to reach for full employment \u0095 Second prosperity for all by closing the productivity gap \u0095 Third the majority of the young going to college or university \u0095 Fourth ensuring not just some but all children have the best start in life as we eradicate child poverty; and \u0095 Fifth meeting peoples rising expectations by delivering the best public services that everyone can rely on. Five radical economic goals for our generation, built on a foundation of stability and economic competence, all born out of our movement's central, driving ideal - that opportunity and security should not be just for a few but for all. First employment. I know the damage unemployment does. I remember my father telling me of working in this city in the 1930s in an era remembered for unemployed men standing on street corners when they wanted to work. I grew up in a mining area where once there were once 66 pits which closures by closure were reduced to just one. For me since the time I went to school and grew up around a mining community and for a whole generation our political life has been dominated by unemployment - long term unemployment, youth unemployment, the fear of unemployment, the consequences of unemployment, the poverty caused by unemployment. Since 1997, 1.1m jobs created, more people in work than ever before. But now is not the time for complacency or relaxing our efforts. And I tell this conference that in the coming election we will seek from the British people a mandate to create and then sustain full employment over the next decade. And not just in one region but all regions of our country. Already youth unemployment cut by over 75%, now the lowest since 1974. 500,000 on training or in work. But we are not satisfied. While stage one of our new deal was to link young people to the jobs, stage two is even bolder - to coach, encourage, train, motivate and yes to ask responsibility from those who are hard to employ who are still left behind but whom we need back to work both for them and because it is the best anti-deprivation, anti-crime, anti-vandalism, anti-poverty policy in our country. Long-term unemployment cut by two thirds, now the lowest since the 1970s. But we are not satisfied. That is why the next stage in the next term is to match the unemployed without jobs to the skills shortages that need action and I call on employers to join us in sector by sector initiatives to meet skill shortages in IT, construction, retail and financial services industries. Having raised lone parent employment from 44% to over 50%, we have yet more to do to reach our target of 70%. So in April, instead of the Tory policy of abolishing the New Deal for Lone Parents, I call on the whole country to support our new policy - training, interviews, advice and help for lone parents to find work - backed up by the doubling of investment from this year in our national child care strategy. The best and surest way of tackling child poverty in our country. And because the problems of our high unemployment areas will not be solved by benefit cheques or by property subsidies but require more enterprises and the opportunity for enterprise open to all, now and for the next Parliament I challenge every business leader to see our inner cities and old industrial estates not as no-go areas for business but as areas of huge untapped potential and consider investing and hiring unemployed men and women. In a new partnership for progress the next step is to ensure - as Labour will pledge itself at the election to do - that for people work pays. Our minimum wage, the historic achievement won not by the government but by your efforts, a statutory national minimum wage. And let us remember also, the minimum wage will never be safe under a Tory government. And as we examine the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission and improve the Working Families Tax Credit, we set a task for the next Parliament: we will continue to build a fairer tax system for the low paid, so that the principle of the WFTC that has made work pay for families with children will be extended to those without children too. And because education and skills are the key to opportunity and our economic future, the next election manifesto will seek also a new ambitious mandate to remove the old barriers to educational opportunity and access to colleges and universities. The reason I, like David Blunkett, am concerned not just about nursery education and standards in the schools but higher staying on rates and wider access to college and university, is that I remember my school classes of the 1960s when it was for only a fraction of young people that a university place was available. It was a scandal of wasted potential. And I see today that there are still thousands of young people who have the ability and should have the chances that I and others were able to enjoy. It was a scandal of wasted potential then and it is still a scandal now. So in the interests of the country's economy as well as individual students, it is time to take the next step so that not just a minority have access to higher and further education but for the first time a majority - and we will do so not by quotas but by investing in educational maintenance allowances worth up to \u00a330 a week for staying on at school, and through summer schools and opening up recruitment, widening access so that our colleges and universities can draw on the widest possible pool of talent. We want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to but the potential you were born with. But our hard won and newly won stability allows us to set an even more challenging goal. Child poverty is a scar on the soul of Britain. Children two or three years old, for whom, without action, we know life never will be fair, destined to fail even before their lives journey has begun and whom it is our duty to help. Child benefit already up 30%. Under the Tories, child benefit, \u00a311 a week. Under Labour, child benefit and the new children's tax credit, \u00a324 a week , twice as much, and for some, \u00a350 a week. One million children taken out of poverty but that is only the start. Our next reform: an integrated child credit, a seamless system of family support, built on universal child benefit. So we will seek a very specific mandate from the people of this country to take the next million children out of poverty, to halve child poverty by 2010 and abolish it in a generation. But let us be clear about the new thinking for the next term because we need care as well as cash, the war against child poverty cannot be won by government national and local alone, only by the combined efforts of parents and private, voluntary, charitable, community and public sectors working together. So in the next Parliament as we expand Sure Start, support community initiatives with the children's fund, toughen up the responsibilities we demand of absent parents, and encourage a new alliance for children, let us make it our mission in every community of our country - as councillors, party members, concerned parents - to bring together and mobilise all the forces of care and compassion so that in this country in our generation we end the shame of child poverty and ensure that no child is left behind, every child the best possible start in life. And our hard won stability is the foundation for achieving another historic Labour goal - to abolish pensioner poverty and ensure every elderly citizen enjoys a rising share in the standard of living of our country. When we came to power our first priority was to tackle pensioner poverty - persistent disabling often hidden poverty especially amongst widows over 75 whose husband had left little or no occupational pension, who had no savings but who under the Tories had only \u00a371 a week to live on, but from April as a result of the priority agreed for tackling pensioner poverty will have \u00a392 a week and then \u00a3100 a week, nearly half as much again as in 1997. And because we must be the voice for those weakest, frailest and most vulnerable citizens who are often least able to use their voice, let us tell the country that it was right - and is right - to take the poorest pensioners out of poverty first. And now having made this start, we propose the next step for the next parliament - to raise the incomes of middle and low income pensioners. Building on the winter allowance, free TV licences for the over 75s, raising the basic pension by \u00a35 and \u00a38, let us tell the country about our new pension credit, a tax and benefit reform that for middle and low income pensioners - for couples with pension incomes of \u00a310,000 or less - will reward saving and ensure higher incomes than they would receive even from an earnings link. And let us tell the country also of the Tories' plans. Even in their disarray over pensions, the same Tory party that did nothing for 20 years about pensioner poverty, still want to abolish the winter allowance, remove free TV licenses and even scrap the Christmas bonus. And we must make it our cause that this should never happen. Let us tell every pensioner in the country of our next steps - a guarantee for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty; for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them; and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country. And let our next step be to build from our new found and hard won stability not just the most basic services, but build over this generation the best public services, services that we can be proud of. Let me be clear - every opportunity we have had - the best schooling, the best of health care when ill, for many of us the best chances at university, - every opportunity we have enjoyed owes its origin to the decisions of past Labour governments, decisions we made as a Labour party to expand education from the few to the many, to create a welfare state that takes the shame out of need and to fund a National Health Service open to all. And it is only because some people have forgotten the chaos, the unreliable pre war voluntary, charitable and private provision that they can contemplate a return to privatised health and basic services. Friends let us tell the country that the contrast between Labour and the Conservatives is starker than it has ever been. It is between Labour who wants to invest, modernise and reform the public services - doubling public investment: education spending rising at 5% a year; health spending at 6% a year; and a 50% rise in transport spending over the coming four years. And the Tories who want to privatise, break up and fragment them. And in this battle over the future of public services, we will ask people to reject the Tory way of cutting public investment and spending and undermining our public services and instead ask for a mandate for the New Labour way, investing more in return for clear output targets and delivery. It is by departments realising they should devolve downwards to a local level and by local government securing flexibility and finance in return for reform and results that we will do best. In our first term we had to set a new national framework, a national framework for stability, employment and public services and tax. In the second term to achieve our goals, full employment, better public services and ending child poverty, we need to devolve power from the centre to regions and local communities. So over the next two years the number of local Public Service Agreements matching resources to output targets signed with local authorities will rise from 20 to 150 and just as for the Regional Development Agencies we have granted more flexibility with more finance, so too with local government we will match that with further steps towards greater flexibility: flexibility in return for reform and resources. I want people to see what we do together as a Labour commitment to the renaissance of local government in our country. So ours is a battle to demonstrate that in the 21st century, we can build strong modern locally run public services that people can rely on. And to win that battle, we must defeat not just political conservatism, but another form of conservatism - and more insidious - cynicism. Reading every day the Tory press releases they are not really trying to win voters' approval they are simply trying to win voters' apathy. The cynics who try to make people believe that governments can never make a difference, that all politicians are just out for themselves, that the only form of public service is self service, that politics never be a force for good. When they say governments always fail and that governments can do no good, their aim is to subvert the decent, progressive instincts of the British people and to defeat the very idea of a progressive public purpose. But to those cynical about public service and public action let us tell them that there are great causes both at home, and all across the world that are worth fighting for. Tomorrow at the G7 meeting of finance ministers we will discuss the next steps in the campaign that Clare Short has led - our duties as industrial countries to lift the crippling burden of third world debt. In building a virtuous circle of debt relief poverty reduction and sustainable development, let us set and meet challenging targets for the year 2015. Instead of one child in every seven dying before the age of five, calling on the pharmaceutical companies and all governments to join us in widening access to life saving drugs and health care and eradicating avoidable infant deaths. Instead of 120 million children denied education every child in primary education. Instead of 1 billion condemned to poverty halving poverty by 2015. And to speed up this process, we will ask the IMF, the World Bank the developed countries and developing countries, churches, charities, companies to forge a plan so that targets set are targets met, goals agreed are goals achieved. And I can tell you today that to lead that goal so that no child is left behind, every child a decent start in life, at our international children's conference on February 26th, Nelson Mandela will inaugurate this new global initiative, worthy of both a second term and our values. Let us answer the cynics by our actions, showing that when governments intervene to tackle injustice they are not violating rights, they are righting wrongs. Let us show that Labour exists not for itself but for larger and noble purposes - what we can achieve for this country and one world. Let us tell the country why we are New Labour, not just by upbringing and custom, but by conviction and belief. We are Labour because we believe that we are not simply self interested individuals, isolated and sufficient unto ourselves, Labour because we are men and women who feel, however distantly, the pain of others, who believe in something bigger than ourselves. Citizens with mutual needs, linked destinies and - yes - shared values, who in Robert Kennedy's words, see suffering and seek to heal it, see pain and seek to end it, see injustice and seek to overcome it, see prejudice and seek to triumph over it. Let us tell the people that it is when politics fail and governments walk away that children are malnourished and too many more are undereducated, that men and women go without jobs and many others are never able to move ahead, that pensioners die in poverty and too many struggle month after month to make ends meet, that public squalor exists alongside private affluence and potential is left unrealized. It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that all can begin to have opportunity and no one is left out. It is when politics succeed and governments engage that all our people have the chance to make the most of themselves and no one and no area is excluded. It is when politics succeeds and governments engage that economic growth and economic justice advance together and rising growth will deliver rising living standards for all. People say Labour's great moment was in the past, in 1945. Others say our great modern triumph was May 1997. But I say again, we have only just begun. And to those same people who say Labour's place in history is assured by winning a second term, I say, it is victory with a mandate Labour seeks. Let us pledge that for our generation our Party's place in history will be measured not just in votes, seats or majorities but in better lives for people who may never know us but whose security and opportunities will as a result of our common endeavour be transformed. Let us have confidence that this great Party, whose roots are in the past but whose faith is in the future, can meet new needs, tackle the great injustices, open up new opportunities and give new life to people's hopes. Let us be the generation that abolished child and pensioner poverty built modern public services, created full employment and took the next steps to prosperity for all. Causes worth fighting for. Let us seize our opportunity And let us use it well.",

      "body": "<p>\"Are you wearing stockings?\" It's the first day of New York fashion week. An English-born PR, now living in Manhattan, is staring at my Nearly Nude-clad legs, one eyebrow raised in alarm. I nod. \"It's freezing,\" I point out feebly. \"Sweetie,\" she says, shaking her head pityingly, \"you can't wear hosiery. Not unless there's snow on the ground.\" </p> <p>New York is scary. Don't think you can relax here, just because there aren't muggers on every street corner any more. The chic New York woman is an utterly formidable force. Players on the London fashion scene tend toward a certain wayward flakiness and will merrily spend a day in ripped fishnets; the Milanese and Parisian fashionistas appear more serious but are partial to a martini with lunch and a spot of afternoon shopping. In New York they drink mineral water and keep their eyes peeled for hosiery. </p> <p>If you don't believe New Yorkers are different, look at the ponytails. In London, ponytails are what you do with your hair when you go to the gym; in New York, they are an art form. With requisite gold-flecked highlights combed taut, they are sleek and aerodynamic as top-of-the-range sports cars, redolent of the self-control necessary to stay size 0 in a country in which, one morning, my breakfast came with 12 rashers of bacon. </p> <p>The effect of this atmosphere of wilful self-control on mainstream designer fashion is to create an oddly homogenous world. The audience want to look like the models on the catwalk, so they diet and shop, and do look pretty much like the models on the catwalk. And since that look is what the audience want, that is what many of the designers give them, in slightly rejigged form, every season. </p> <p>Waiting for the Carolina Herrera show to start on Monday, my eye was caught by a particularly perfect ponytail, on a beautiful twentysomething brunette in butter soft suede shirt and skirt and high-heeled boots. I wasn't the only one aware of her perfection: when the lights went down, preventing her from gazing on her reflection in the mirrored catwalk, a tiny frown briefly puckered her lovely face. But she needn't have worried, for when the models emerged, elegant in belted jackets, cashmere polo-necks and knee-length skirts, it must have been like looking in a mirror. She and her friends could have stepped on to the catwalk and joined the procession, and the audience would have been none the wiser. </p> <p>The pervading ideal of New York fashion is rich girl chic. Rich girl chic is about the lifestyle the clothes suggest: the luxurious, delicate fabrics, the demure, cocktail-party silhouettes, the high-heeled, delicate limo shoes. </p> <p>For next winter, designers seized on an evocative aspect of the rich girl lifestyle: the Pony Club. Equestrian was the theme at Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, DKNY and Vivienne Tam. Perhaps the idea came from the New York success of the jaw-droppingly expensive, sensuously curved Christian Dior \"saddle\" bag, already hailed as a modern classic. After all, Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City seems to have about five. </p> <p>At Ralph Lauren, the look centred on tight jodhpurs with suede knee patches, shiny boots and hacking jackets worn tightly buttoned over polo-necks. Rich cable-knit sweaters were worn under windowpane-check coats, all in a palette of espresso brown, caramel and winter white. For DKNY, Donna Karan also used creamy, luxe shades, the better to show off the show-stealing fabrics - leather, suede, shearling and more cable-knit. Here, the riding theme was a looser brief: it's probably possible to ride in a chiffon ra-ra skirt but I doubt it is dressage etiquette </p> <p> Michael Kors, who sent his models out with printed silk scarves tied into their ponytails, put a spin on the theme and called the result \"posh country\". There was strong colour in this collection: \"Kelly\" apple green, \"pumpkin\" orange and canary yellow. \"Sidesaddle\" skirts had origami-like folds at the back, like bustles; ponchos came in Barbour-influenced quilted fabrics. There was salt-and-pepper tweed, fur-and leather-trimmed knitwear, and a whiff of the stables in eveningwear, where a black jersey dress was secured with a shoulder strap of shiny buckled leather. </p> <p>Vivienne Tam also used equestrian styling - knee boots over trousers, teamed with snug sweaters - and rich colours. Olive green, burnt orange, royal purple and turquoise made this one of the brightest shows. </p> <p>But while jodhpurs are undoubtedly sexy, they simply won't do for after dark. Long svelte column dresses were decreed the chicest evening option by Oscar de la Renta, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors (who used buckle detailing to great effect) and Carolina Herrera (who sent out stunning gowns in black lace and purple or bronze satin). Designers who braved the no-hosiery rule to go knee-length included Diane von Furstenberg (who produced a drop-dead dress in draped red satin) and Badgley Mischka (classic strapless black taffeta). </p> <p>But of course, outside the realm of perfume sales and million-dollar licensing deals, there are mavericks. Strangest show of the week was a close-run thing between Imitation of Christ and Miguel Adrover. Imitation sat the audience in a cinema and screened footage of models posing in a foyer outside; the short, frothy party frocks in lace and satin looked perfect for extroverts with good legs and lots of cash. Adrover, revelling in the luxury of his Pegasus Apparel Group backing, indulged a love of Egypt with an incense-heavy presentation in an overcrowded tent. </p> <p>Meanwhile Betsey Johnson, who would probably die of boredom if she saw a cream cashmere polo-neck, did her best to rock the good-taste boat. Using hair extensions, she gave each model her own trademark multicoloured exploding-pineapple hairstyle and the mini-Betseys looked pure as the New York snow in pink lace teddies, blue tutus and lace-topped fishnets, or lilac glitter corsets and pink denim hipster minis with lime lace G-strings peeking above. </p> <p>Somewhere between the strict rules of American luxe and Johnson's neon anarchy, two designers have found a sliver of the New York market that is ready for a more open-minded idea of style. Marc Jacobs and catwalk newcomer Katayone Adeli both produced assured collections that were feminine without being prissy, interesting without being odd. Marc Jacobs successfully juggled his two New York labels, showing Coco-influenced naive elegance in his upscale own label line, where the lemon yellow sequined mohair coat went immediately on to every wish list in the house, and dandyish, precocious, cigarettes-in-the-common-room chic in his younger Marc line, which featured striped drainpipe jeans, denim frock coats and dramatic ruffle skirts. </p> <p>Katayone Adeli, already known for sympathetic tailoring and attention to detail, showed a collection that had shades of Helmut Lang, but with a girlish twist: sculpted, trumpet-sleeved, almost Elizabethan jackets and lace-edged blouses, silk combat trousers with ruched seams and satin tea dresses in vanilla and black. You might not be able to ride in them, but these clothes are the hottest tip for next autumn we've seen so far.</p>",

If it decides misconduct has occurred, it can pass the case on to a separate adjudication panel, which can impose a wide range of sanctions, including disqualification from public office for up to five years.</p> <p>The board replaces the current regime of self-regulation, in which councillors can ultimately be disciplined only with the consent of their party group. But despite this erosion of their freedom, many local politicians have welcomed the creation of the standards board as a means of cleaning up local government's image. Mr Holland agrees: \"The key issue is the confidence of the public in local government. Anything that can improve that has to be to the benefit of everybody.

Add to that the likelihood that there will be an initial rush of complaints when the public realises that the standards board exists, and you have the potential for a massive workload.</p> <p>So why did he want the job? He has never been a councillor or local government officer, although he did work with Plymouth city council as part of its city challenge regeneration project. He does, however, have some experience of dealing with issues of probity and ethics. He once edited a major conduct guide for solicitors, and was previously principal ombudsman to the Personal Investment Authority - just one of the many charity, quango and professional society boards on which he has sat.</p> <p>Mr Holland's answer is simple: \"I can't establish what the government's criteria for the job were. I applied for it because I was interested.\"</p> <p>His workload could, however, be a good thing for local authorities. The government is publishing a largely mandatory national code of conduct for councillors, who are being required to adapt it to their own authority's circumstances by setting up their own local standards committees.</p> <p>If the national board is overwhelmed, the local committees could take on some of the work, providing what the Local Government Association sees as a boost to local discretion.</p> <p>This is a possibility Mr Holland will probably be open to: \"With any new organisation you're involved in listening mode to begin with, particularly when you're moving from self-regulation to an outside body. You'd be stupid to go in heavily right at the beginning.\"</p> <p>And for the councillors he will be investigating, Mr Holland adds: \"Regard us as a friend, as someone who can help improve the perception of local government.

You'd be stupid to go in heavily right at the beginning.\" And for the councillors he will be investigating, Mr Holland adds: \"Regard us as a friend, as someone who can help improve the perception of local government. We're all working to a common end here, which is to increase the regard in which local government is held.\"",

A cross-party group of MPs believe that public opposition will mount against Kirch, which is waging a court battle to be allowed to sell off the UK rights to the highest bidder, which would be a pay-TV company rather than free-to-air broadcasters ITV and the BBC. Labour MP John Grogan, who yesterday signed an early day motion protesting at the company's plans, said pay-TV operators such as BSkyB would be unlikely to risk the wrath of the football-loving public by bidding for the World Cup rights. BSkyB owns 22% of Kirch's pay-TV subsidiary. \"A company like BSkyB would have to calculate the public relations consequences of doing a deal with Kirch. The World Cup is unlike any other event because of the volume of people who watch it,\" said Mr Grogan. Fellow Labour MP Ivor Caplin, the treasurer of the Commons all-party football group, called for Kirch to enter negotiations with the BBC and ITV immediately, as pay-TV operators may avoid bidding altogether. \"Our pay-TV providers may see this as an argument they do not want to get involved in.

The MPs' arguments are backed by UK broadcasting sources close to the talks between the BBC, ITV and Kirch. One industry insider said that because the 2002 tournament will be held in Japan, the kick-off times will be too early to attract a massive UK audience and this will reduce the value of the rights. \"Most of the games will be kicking off between 7 and 8am, UK time, and that can only affect the commercial value of the rights,\" said the source. Kirch has asked the European court of justice to overrule the EU Commission's decision to enshrine the UK 1996 Broadcasting Act within European law. The act lists the World Cup as a sporting event of national importance that must seen on free-to-air channels in the UK. Kirch is arguing that the Commission's decision to include this list within EU law is a restraint of its trading and property rights.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Great editors are even more rare, and perhaps more necessary, than great writers: they are seldom the same people. A plausible history of 20th-century English literature can be extrapolated from magazines such as John Lehmann's New Writing, Cyril Connolly's Horizon, and Alan Ross's London Magazine. Of these the third, belonging to a period when the solid, book-shaped literary monthly seemed to have had its day, is in some respects the most extraordinary achievement.</p> <p>Alan Ross, who has died aged 78, was born in Calcutta, where his father worked in the coal-mining industry. He was educated at Falmouth, and then at private school in East Grinstead, where in the holidays he pursued his passion for cricket at the Sussex county ground at Hove. He then went to Haileybury and St John's College, Oxford, to read modern languages.</p> <p>His undergraduate career was, however, interrupted by naval war service on Russian convoys, and, demobilised in 1947, he had no wish to return to Oxford. He had completed, in Germany, the poems for his first full-length collection, The Derelict Day (1947); he had made important friendships among writers and artists; and he almost immediately set off for Corsica, with the painter John Minton, to write his first travel book, Time Was Away (1948).</p> <p>He landed on his feet financially too, receiving an award from the Rockefeller Foundation, working for the British Council, and, from 1950, becoming a sports writer on the Observer. In 1949, he married Jennifer Fry, of the chocolate-making dynasty; their son, Jonathan, was born in 1953.</p> <p>If Ross's reputation as a poet is somewhat blurred, this is partly because his own writing was inevitably overshadowed by his editorial self, and partly because his poems are dominated by two themes uncongenial to contemporary English taste - war and travel.</p> <p>Poems 1942-67 (1967), which, he wrote in a preface, \"replaces my five previous volumes\", includes revised versions of some war poems; they are full of reportage, yet oddly impersonal, and often reveal (especially in the long JW 51B) a fondness for adventurous yarn-spinning. Three later collections - The Taj Express (1973), Open Sea (1975) and Death Valley (1980) - confirm his delight in places and things caught with a journalist's sense of the significant occasion, but his eye is usually keener than his ear, and the poems, for all their attention to detail, lack resonance.</p> <p>When he inherited the London Magazine from Lehmann in 1961, Ross had the enormous advantage of being neither a disappointed academic nor a creative writer in need of regular work, but a literary all-rounder whose interests and contacts spanned the arts and sporting worlds.</p> <p>Introducing volume 1, number 1 of his \"new series\" that April, he announced that the magazine would grow from a \"monthly review of literature\" into a \"review of the arts\"; it would have gravity and astringency, but never solemnity nor malice, and \"at all costs experiment, the hopefulness that the best, even most melancholy art, always must generate, even in despite of itself\". It was an ambitious programme, and an expensive one, but he was as good as his word.</p> <p>Throughout the 1960s, London Magazine (Ross dropped the definite article in 1966) was an exemplary success, alert to a time of artistic fluidity yet never losing sight of its civilised principles; indeed, its editorial quirks - strange pieces on sporting subjects or exotic places, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of minor writers' interlocking memoirs among them - helpfully kept the magazine anchored beyond the fluffy ephemera of the decade. In 1965, he launched two parallel ven tures, a hardback list (Alan Ross Ltd) and the eclectic London Magazine Editions, slender paperbacks elegantly set in Juliana and bound in grainy brown covers - \"like wholemeal bread\", said one reviewer.</p> <p>Both were in style and substance extensions of the magazine; early hardbacks included Barbara Skelton's Born Losers, J Maclaren-Ross's Memoirs Of The Forties, TC Worsley's Flannelled Fool and Keith Vaughan's Journals And Drawings, while the paperback series concentrated on younger writers and anthologies. It was entirely characteristic of Ross that 15 years later, when he had virtually given up book-publishing, he should have revived the LME imprint to produce two hardbacks by his old and abruptly publisherless friend Roy Fuller, and made a great success of them.</p> <p>In 1971, exactly 10 years after taking over LM, Ross decided to transform it into a bi-monthly, citing the success of the double 100th issue in 1969 and a summer double number in 1970. But they were special occasions, and the fat, but infrequent, magazine seemed to lose focus. Monthly publication was resumed in 1977, and, for a while, the magazine seemed restored to its old self, until in July 1973 Ross published a provocative article by Dotson Rader, The Private Letters Of Tennessee Williams, which led to an expensive libel action. The magazine survived, though only after an appeal and a \"final reminder\" from Ross in the fraught double issue of February/March 1981. LM's 20th anniversary was almost its wake.</p> <p>All times are difficult for literary publishers, but the 1980s - with soaring costs, declining advertising revenue, and the whole concept of a literary culture more than ever under threat - were next to impossible. They took their toll of LM; a retrenchment to bi-monthly publication, fewer pages, poorer illustrations, a daunting cover price. But its commitment to good and various writing remained and, as magazines such as Encounter and the Listener folded, it became indispensable.</p> <p>Ross, meanwhile, pursued a wide range of other projects. He was on the Observer staff until 1971, and, as cricket correspondent, twice toured Australia, South Africa and the West Indies . He edited the Cricketer's Companion, wrote half a dozen other books on the game. He edited numerous anthologies, wrote several books for children, and, in the late 1980s, produced two witty and civilised volumes of autobiography, Blindfold Games (1986) and Coastwise Lights (1988); the latter ends, charmingly, not on a literary note but with a chapter on The Racing Game. With Ross, the two were always intermingled - his horses ran in brown and pink, the colours of the LM of July 1965, the month they were registered.</p> <p>Ross's promptness in dealing with manuscripts was legendary and open to varying interpretations. Hugo Williams, his assistant at LM for many years, once wrote of him turning contributions round at the door - for which their authors, said Williams, were pathetically grateful. But he may have missed the point. When, as a sixth-former, I sent my first, almost-publishable poems to Ross, he returned them, but not with a printed rejection slip. \"I like these, though not quite enough to take: AR.\" Slender encouragement, but it was enough, more than I deserved, and it kept me writing. He must have done the same for thousands of others. In that way, too, he was a great editor.</p> <p>Ross divorced Jennifer, and, at the end of last year, married Jane Rye; Victoria is the stepdaughter of that marriage.</p> <p><b>Neil Powell </b></p> <p><b>Michael Davie writes:</b> Alan Ross seemed to change remarkably little in style and appearance, and not at all in character, during 50 years. I first met him in the cricket XI at Haileybury. He was a very good opening bowler, but a sloppy fielder. When Alan, at mid-on, failed to stop a drive with his boot, a stout, businessman parent called out: \"Why doesn't Ross get his hair cut?\" I sympathised. with the parent.

      "bodyText": "Great editors are even more rare, and perhaps more necessary, than great writers: they are seldom the same people. A plausible history of 20th-century English literature can be extrapolated from magazines such as John Lehmann's New Writing, Cyril Connolly's Horizon, and Alan Ross's London Magazine. Of these the third, belonging to a period when the solid, book-shaped literary monthly seemed to have had its day, is in some respects the most extraordinary achievement. Alan Ross, who has died aged 78, was born in Calcutta, where his father worked in the coal-mining industry. He was educated at Falmouth, and then at private school in East Grinstead, where in the holidays he pursued his passion for cricket at the Sussex county ground at Hove. He then went to Haileybury and St John's College, Oxford, to read modern languages. His undergraduate career was, however, interrupted by naval war service on Russian convoys, and, demobilised in 1947, he had no wish to return to Oxford. He had completed, in Germany, the poems for his first full-length collection, The Derelict Day (1947); he had made important friendships among writers and artists; and he almost immediately set off for Corsica, with the painter John Minton, to write his first travel book, Time Was Away (1948). He landed on his feet financially too, receiving an award from the Rockefeller Foundation, working for the British Council, and, from 1950, becoming a sports writer on the Observer. In 1949, he married Jennifer Fry, of the chocolate-making dynasty; their son, Jonathan, was born in 1953. If Ross's reputation as a poet is somewhat blurred, this is partly because his own writing was inevitably overshadowed by his editorial self, and partly because his poems are dominated by two themes uncongenial to contemporary English taste - war and travel. Poems 1942-67 (1967), which, he wrote in a preface, \"replaces my five previous volumes\", includes revised versions of some war poems; they are full of reportage, yet oddly impersonal, and often reveal (especially in the long JW 51B) a fondness for adventurous yarn-spinning. Three later collections - The Taj Express (1973), Open Sea (1975) and Death Valley (1980) - confirm his delight in places and things caught with a journalist's sense of the significant occasion, but his eye is usually keener than his ear, and the poems, for all their attention to detail, lack resonance. When he inherited the London Magazine from Lehmann in 1961, Ross had the enormous advantage of being neither a disappointed academic nor a creative writer in need of regular work, but a literary all-rounder whose interests and contacts spanned the arts and sporting worlds. Introducing volume 1, number 1 of his \"new series\" that April, he announced that the magazine would grow from a \"monthly review of literature\" into a \"review of the arts\"; it would have gravity and astringency, but never solemnity nor malice, and \"at all costs experiment, the hopefulness that the best, even most melancholy art, always must generate, even in despite of itself\". It was an ambitious programme, and an expensive one, but he was as good as his word. Throughout the 1960s, London Magazine (Ross dropped the definite article in 1966) was an exemplary success, alert to a time of artistic fluidity yet never losing sight of its civilised principles; indeed, its editorial quirks - strange pieces on sporting subjects or exotic places, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of minor writers' interlocking memoirs among them - helpfully kept the magazine anchored beyond the fluffy ephemera of the decade. In 1965, he launched two parallel ven tures, a hardback list (Alan Ross Ltd) and the eclectic London Magazine Editions, slender paperbacks elegantly set in Juliana and bound in grainy brown covers - \"like wholemeal bread\", said one reviewer. Both were in style and substance extensions of the magazine; early hardbacks included Barbara Skelton's Born Losers, J Maclaren-Ross's Memoirs Of The Forties, TC Worsley's Flannelled Fool and Keith Vaughan's Journals And Drawings, while the paperback series concentrated on younger writers and anthologies.

      "body": "<p>The Guardian will make legal history today when it launches a high court challenge under the Human Rights Act to a 153-year-old law which threatens anyone calling in print for abolition of the monarchy with life imprisonment. </p> <p>The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, and columnist Polly Toynbee will file a claim at the high court in London today against the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, and the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith. </p> <p>The case is the first to be brought purely under the Human Rights Act since it came into force last October. The act has been invoked in criminal and civil cases but the Guardian's is the first to be brought under a freestanding right to bring proceedings in a court or tribunal. </p> <p>The claim alleges that the 1848 Treason Felony Act violates article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to free speech. </p> <p>The paper launched a campaign last December 6 - the date of the Queen's speech at the state opening of parliament - urging readers to support moves to establish Britain as a republic. The editor contacted the attorney general before publication seeking assurances that he and his staff would not be prosecuted if they advocated change by peaceful means only. </p> <p>Lord Williams replied that such conduct \"may be criminal\" and refused to confirm that there would be no prosecution. None of the journalists who called for a republic has been threatened with prosecution. But the December 6 edition is still available as a back issue, the articles can be downloaded from the Guardian website, and the paper plans to continue its campaign. </p> <p>\"It is of importance to the right of freedom of expression guaranteed to the claimants and to their readers that the threat to prosecute should be authoritatively declared either baseless or real,\" papers filed with the court say. </p> <p>The Guardian is seeking to clarify the Treason Felony Act as the first step in a legal campaign which will see it backing a challenge the Act of Settlement, the 300-year-old law which bans non-Protestants from succession to the British throne and discriminates against women and those born out of wedlock. </p> <p>Mr Rusbridger said: \"The Treason Felony Act is one more piece of archaic legal nonsense surrounding the monarchy. People may say it's meaningless but meaningless laws are bad laws. Like the Act of Settlement, it's about time it was scrapped.\" </p> <p>He and Ms Toynbee are asking the court to interpret the Treason Felony Act to mean that advocating the overthrow of the monarchy by non-violent methods is no longer a crime. Under the Human Rights Act, judges have power to amend the wording of acts of parliament to make them comply with rights guaranteed by the European Convention. </p> <p>If this is impossible, they may declare the statute incompatible, leaving it to parliament to amend it or face proceedings at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Guardian will make legal history today when it launches a high court challenge under the Human Rights Act to a 153-year-old law which threatens anyone calling in print for abolition of the monarchy with life imprisonment. The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, and columnist Polly Toynbee will file a claim at the high court in London today against the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, and the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith. The case is the first to be brought purely under the Human Rights Act since it came into force last October. The act has been invoked in criminal and civil cases but the Guardian's is the first to be brought under a freestanding right to bring proceedings in a court or tribunal. The claim alleges that the 1848 Treason Felony Act violates article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to free speech. The paper launched a campaign last December 6 - the date of the Queen's speech at the state opening of parliament - urging readers to support moves to establish Britain as a republic. The editor contacted the attorney general before publication seeking assurances that he and his staff would not be prosecuted if they advocated change by peaceful means only. Lord Williams replied that such conduct \"may be criminal\" and refused to confirm that there would be no prosecution. None of the journalists who called for a republic has been threatened with prosecution. But the December 6 edition is still available as a back issue, the articles can be downloaded from the Guardian website, and the paper plans to continue its campaign. \"It is of importance to the right of freedom of expression guaranteed to the claimants and to their readers that the threat to prosecute should be authoritatively declared either baseless or real,\" papers filed with the court say. The Guardian is seeking to clarify the Treason Felony Act as the first step in a legal campaign which will see it backing a challenge the Act of Settlement, the 300-year-old law which bans non-Protestants from succession to the British throne and discriminates against women and those born out of wedlock. Mr Rusbridger said: \"The Treason Felony Act is one more piece of archaic legal nonsense surrounding the monarchy. People may say it's meaningless but meaningless laws are bad laws. Like the Act of Settlement, it's about time it was scrapped.\" He and Ms Toynbee are asking the court to interpret the Treason Felony Act to mean that advocating the overthrow of the monarchy by non-violent methods is no longer a crime. Under the Human Rights Act, judges have power to amend the wording of acts of parliament to make them comply with rights guaranteed by the European Convention. If this is impossible, they may declare the statute incompatible, leaving it to parliament to amend it or face proceedings at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.",

Future has also appointed Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to look at sale options for its recently launched internet business fortnightly, Business 2.0. After the drastic cost-cutting measures, which will save the company \u00a35m this year, Future will be left with 114 titles and 1,650 employees. Future said last month it expected total revenues and profit for 2000 to fall short of already reduced forecasts because of poor sales. Yesterday's ABC figures confirm this downturn, with the bulk of Future's portfolio showing drastic slumps. Sales of its worst performing title, Dreamcast magazine DC-UK, dropped by 40.5%.

This year the three-week Tour would clash with the first two Ashes Tests and Channel 4 said yesterday that, in spite of \"15 years of proud association with the Tour\", it would be \"unable to do it justice\". Ironically the broadcaster could be forced to continue paying the European Broadcasting Union for the rights, even though it is not going to show the race. Channel 4 has a four-year contract, renewed last year, with the EBU, which holds the European rights to the race; unless Channel 4 can sell or license the rights, it will have to pay. The BBC is not ruling out taking up the coverage - \"we'll never say never,\" said a spokeswoman - although it is unlikely this year. The Tour starts on July 7, the day before Wimbledon finishes, and clashes with golf's Open. ITV has been approached but has not covered cycling since the early 1980s, while Channel 5 has said it is not interested. The Tour does, however, receive extensive live coverage on Eurosport. \u0095 The Spanish cyclist Ricardo Ochoa died yesterday and his twin brother Xavier, a stage winner last year in the Tour de France at Hautacam, was in a coma after they were hit by a car while training near Malaga.",

      "body": "<p>A \u00a33bn NHS hospital building programme announced yesterday will include 26 \"fast-track\" centres to speed up the treatment of non-urgent patients who often have their appointments cancelled. </p> <p>Health secretary Alan Milburn said 29 building projects, worth \u00a33.1bn, had been approved by his department. There will be an 11% increase in funding for training NHS staff, to alleviate the shortage of doctors, nurses and other professionals. </p> <p>Every region in the country would be required to increase hospital beds to end the misery of patients being shipped to hospitals miles from home because of bed shortages. </p> <p>\"This is an unprecedented expansion in new hospital developments in the NHS,\" Mr Milburn told the House of Commons. \"For millions of patients and thousands of staff it will provide modern state-of-the-art hospital treatment and care.\" The Department of Health was preparing to allow 18 schemes, but is approving all 29 recommended by its expert advisers. </p> <p>The hospital projects will be built under the public finance initiative, with an option for the NHS to resume ownership at the end of the contract. </p> <p>Work will begin this year on the first 12, in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol's mental health services, Central Middlesex, East Kent, Leicester, Lewisham, Peterborough, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Wakefield and Whipps Cross in London. </p> <p>\"You cannot deliver 21st century care in 19th century buildings,\" Mr Milburn said. \"For too long investment in NHS infrastructure has been a low priority when it should have been a high priority. </p> <p>\"The consequences are plain for all to see: buildings that are shoddy, equipment that is unreliable, hospitals that are out of date.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a33bn NHS hospital building programme announced yesterday will include 26 \"fast-track\" centres to speed up the treatment of non-urgent patients who often have their appointments cancelled. Health secretary Alan Milburn said 29 building projects, worth \u00a33.1bn, had been approved by his department. There will be an 11% increase in funding for training NHS staff, to alleviate the shortage of doctors, nurses and other professionals. Every region in the country would be required to increase hospital beds to end the misery of patients being shipped to hospitals miles from home because of bed shortages. \"This is an unprecedented expansion in new hospital developments in the NHS,\" Mr Milburn told the House of Commons. \"For millions of patients and thousands of staff it will provide modern state-of-the-art hospital treatment and care.\" The Department of Health was preparing to allow 18 schemes, but is approving all 29 recommended by its expert advisers. The hospital projects will be built under the public finance initiative, with an option for the NHS to resume ownership at the end of the contract. Work will begin this year on the first 12, in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol's mental health services, Central Middlesex, East Kent, Leicester, Lewisham, Peterborough, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Wakefield and Whipps Cross in London. \"You cannot deliver 21st century care in 19th century buildings,\" Mr Milburn said. \"For too long investment in NHS infrastructure has been a low priority when it should have been a high priority. \"The consequences are plain for all to see: buildings that are shoddy, equipment that is unreliable, hospitals that are out of date. In too many places the environment where staff work and patients receive care is simply unacceptable.\" Sixteen of the new hospitals will have the fast-track centres, which will treat only patients who need routine operations such as hip replacements. In most hospitals, planned surgery is always at risk of being cancelled to make way for emergencies. Ten other fast-track facilities will be built at existing hospitals. \"Patients will be able to book their admissions at their convenience rather than simply being given an appointment date,\" said Mr Milburn. \"Some will operate at weekends. Crucially they will mean greater reliability for patients by helping to end the misery of last-minute cancelled operations.\" There are serious shortages of doctors and, particularly, nurses in the NHS, but Mr Milburn claimed that numbers have already risen in response to recruitment campaigns and new training places. Between September 1999 and September 2000, there were 2,500 more doctors, 3,500 more scientists, therapists and technicians and over 6,300 more nurses in the NHS. The new money is intended to keep staff numbers increasing until 2010. The bed-cutting which has been a feature of the NHS for four decades is at an end, Mr Milburn said.

Other bidders - now suddenly many more - can come forward and suggest something better than a disgraceful fire-sale at a knock-down price to property developers. It would have been the final scandal of the dome's history. The panic that seized the government at the end of last year is over. There is time to stop and think, time to consider every option - \"as long as it takes,\" says Lord Falconer - no artificial deadlines. But will it be saved as a public space?</p> <p>Now the dome is closed, the spate of bad news that hung over it like a thick smog has lifted. Panic was the danger - the same panic that seized governments before. The Festival of Britain of 1951, besieged by many of the same headlines calling it a monstrous waste of public money, was razed to the ground the day it closed to save further public embarrassment. The incoming Conservative government smashed the Skylon to pieces and bulldozed the Dome of Discovery, both icons that would now be loved and revered landmarks.</p> <p>They couldn't move fast enough to pull down the Crystal Palace after the Great Exhibition of 1851 and remove it to a distant suburb where it later burned to the ground. The moment a great public exhibition closes is the moment when it is least fashionable and least valued. Its value plummets so low people can't even see the value of the land around it. By the time the final deal is done, we will look back on the idea of selling this majestic site for a fraction of its true worth with utter incredulity.</p> <p>Talking to top London property dealers yesterday, they said there had been a phenomenal conspiracy of silence among the five big property companies who stood by and looked on as Legacy seemed about to be given it almost as a gift. \"We could not believe it,\" said one leading estate agent.</p> <p>Why the silence? Well, it was government business and no one wanted to make trouble, with future contracts in mind. But consider this, said one. Canary Wharf is just 40 seconds' travel time from the dome peninsula. Last November the Canary Wharf Group plc acquired a new 6.3-acre tract of land for development in North Canary Wharf called Shed 35. It cost them \u00a353m. That is the same sum Legacy was proposing to put down on 63 similar acres, with just another \u00a375m to follow later. \"The site value has soared in the past 20 months since bids were first invited. Now there is a tube and infrastructure, it's a different game.\" He reckons a full and fair global competition will bring in a sizeable fortune for the site - and still leave plenty of room for publicly owned space.</p> <p>Now for round two. This spectacular peninsula is the most beautiful piece of undeveloped urban landscape in the capital, surrounded by the Thames on three sides, under a great wide sky with breathtaking views in all directions. Reached by boat and by one of London's most architecturally exciting new tube stations, this is a dream public space, a park, a treasure. Once sold off and built over, it will be gone for ever, unreclaimable for the public.</p> <p>Richard Rogers, architect of this mighty white structure, is one of those who has been fighting hard behind the scenes to keep it as a publicly owned place for ever. If the Skylon, the Dome of Discovery and the Crystal Palace still stood, how extraordinary it would seem now ever to sell them off. If some of the dome land is now sold well, the dome and its park can remain a public place, with no need to sell it, though it might be rented.</p> <p>The day will come - probably soon - when some Olympic or other sporting or cultural event will need the dome in a capital bereft of wonderful sites. The failure of Wembley Stadium plans is just another example of how badly Britain does great national monuments. But now we have a chance to get this right.</p> <p>The last great dome crisis forced the Millennium Commission angrily to fork out a final \u00a347m last October. But this sum was never actually drawn down. In its last three months, according to one millennium commissioner, increased numbers of visitors meant the dome broke even and never used those final funds that caused such volcanic public fury. The money is there, already given to the dome, and it should be used to help ensure the dome remains a public space. But the real endowment comes from the land around it, sold to create a trust for it in perpetuity.</p> <p>Richard Rogers has an ambitious vision for the place and is likely to join better developers to propose a scheme for the North Greenwich peninsula that would be a model for the kind of regeneration his Urban Task Force advocates. It would include at least 40% affordable housing for the local community: he has been talking with Peabody and Rowntree about social housing possibilities.</p> <p>It would be a high density cityscape with shops and offices as well as homes, looking on to a leisure park around the dome that would be a national attraction for sports and concerts - run by PY or the BBC/Tussauds group, or any other entertainment consortium. He talks of things built in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and London's terrible past mistakes.</p> <p>Last time I wrote about the dome, a fair number of emails from around the country complained bitterly at any more public time, money or attention being thrown at this London site. They have a point. It would have been better had the dome been built elsewhere. But there it is now in Greenwich, a national treasure on a site of natural beauty. Huge sums have been wasted, but that is no reason to waste the only good that can come from it.</p> <p>Rogers points across the water to Canary Wharf, the great emblem of the Thatcher era - all offices, stylish restaurants and expensive houses, a pure property developers' hygienic, anodyne heaven straight from the brochure. It is an eerie place - no children, schools or old people, no workers, beggars, misfits, everything crisp and pricey for its cloned battalions of young professionals, with none of the eccentric, random oddity that breathes real city life. Now imagine across the water a Labour era development in complete social contrast, a regeneration project as a model for other city schemes.</p> <p>The question is: does this mark new thinking by Labour? In the early days, how avidly they sought to show they were as friendly to private developers as any conservative government. The tube is the next big question, as bargaining continues ferociously behind the scenes.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, jaw set, says the risk of major construction programmes must all be borne by private companies, despite passionate public opinion in favour of keeping it publicly owned. He ploughs on with the sale of air traffic control too, against the public will.

Pierre-Yves Gerbeau The dome's former chief executive is talking up grand plans to run it as a visitor attraction during the day, with virtual reality technology rather than big dippers to woo trippers, and a 50,000-seat sporting and entertainment venue at night. The Frenchman is backed by James Palumbo, boss of the London nightclub group Ministry of Sound. He has spoken of reuniting the Beatles, inviting Madonna and Michael Jackson and staging a Lennox Lewis world championship fight; but serious questions remain over whether he will get financial backing. He has said he might have to rent, rather than buy, the structure. The Duke of Westminster Britain's richest peer is considering a return to the fray with his own consortium after rejecting overtures from Legacy. The group has cont-acted the BBC, Tussauds and Harvey Goldsmith. The bil lionaire duke's privately-owned Grosvenor Estates is in a consortium with three other property developers: Stanhope, Lend Lease and Quintain Estates, which already owns land next to the Greenwich site. If it did a deal with the BBC, Tussauds or Harvey Goldsmith, the dome could be a public attraction surrounded by homes, offices and shops. Guy Hands Best man at William Hague's wedding and head of Nom-ura's Principal Finance Group which specialises in buying unfashionable businesses at bargain prices. Nomura has already bought service quarters from the Ministry of Defence and owns 6,000 pubs. The preferred bidder until it dropped out last September, Nomura must decide if it is worth another go, and could yet finance a bid. Nomura's original plan was Dome Europe, a visitor attraction featuring fashion, innovations, food, traditions and arts. PY Gerbeau suggested earlier this week he had support from the Japanese bank. Nomura said not so and may be reluctant to bid again. BBC Wanted to transform the dome into a virtual reality theme park, possibly including working models of the Walking with Dinosaurs variety. Could provide a useful public sector link for a wider bid. Interested in the dome, not the surroundings. Tussauds Group The owner of the world famous waxworks museum and Alton Towers proposes a mixed business and leisure centre including a theme park focusing on the latest technology. Harvey Goldsmith Veteran pop promoter who has expressed an interest in putting on concerts in the giant indoor arena. Galliard Homes The housebuilder is one of a number of developers that formed consortiums to make a bid if Legacy failed. Proposing high-rise flats on the site, Galliard is said to be more interested in the land than the dome.

      "bodyText": "If the loss of the first dome bidder could be explained away by ministers as a tragedy, the rejection of a second has turned the process into a farce. Legacy chairman Richard Bourne, a millionaire Labour donor fond of throwing parties for the glitterati of the people's party, was sitting in his Chelsea office yesterday when the phone rang at 12.27pm. John Walker, head of English Partnerships, the government agency advising ministers on the sale of the building and land, told him during an awkward 90-second conversation that an official statement would be made at 12.30pm. Mr Walker should not have bothered. Sitting on Mr Bourne's desk was a copy of the statement, obtained via an unofficial route. Once pencilled in as the first paragraph of Mr Blair's manifesto, the Greenwich white elephant now threatens to be an election liability as William Hague cites the failure to sell it as evidence of government incompetence. As Legacy prepared to pull out and potential bidders - ranging from the BBC and Pierre-Yves Gerbeau to the Duke of Westminster and countless property developers - considered stepping in, the government and Legacy were left to reflect on how it had gone so badly wrong. In the blame game the government accused Legacy, fronted by Mr Bourne and dominated by the controversial Irish group Treasury Holdings, of failing to put together a viable business plan or company structure. Deputy prime minister John Prescott, who has been leading the sale process, believes the dome should remain in public hands and is against Legacy's proposals. He is said to have sided against Tony Blair and the dome minister, Lord Falconer, who wanted to give Legacy more time. Mr Prescott is thought to want a project to be put together by English Partnerships which would allow the government to retain some ownership over the dome's future. \"There does appear to be an opinion forming that the dome should stay in the public sector,\" one source said last night. Ministers have complained that they were repeatedly required to advise Legacy over four months of negotiations after it was anointed \"preferred bidder\" in November - two months after the Japanese bank Nomura, the original favourite, had pulled out. The \u00a3125m price was to be paid in instalments, with \u00a350m up front and the rest over three years. English Partnerships and the government were worried that Legacy was planning to delay investing \u00a3150m to transform the site into knowledge city, an indoor town of hi-tech firms, and questioned whether firms mentioned by Legacy would rent space. And the consortium's structure, 15% owned by Mr Bourne, 80% by Treasury Holdings and 5% by the Bank of Scotland, did not foster confidence in Whitehall. Treasury's owners, Richard Barrett and John Ronan, have been embroiled in political and business controversies on the other side of the Irish sea, and ministers urged Legacy to seek new partners to widen its share base and experience. Legacy maintained that it did everything the government asked and pinned the blame on ministers. \"Quite frankly we could have exchanged contracts in three weeks. Only the government knows why it has done this,\" said a Legacy source. Mr Bourne thought he had played his joker on Monday when he introduced Lord Falconer to his new backers, executives of the Teesland Group property development body. Teesland, lined up for a 10% stake, had worked closely with English Partnerships but it was too late, according to government sources, who indicated that ministers thought \"the game was up\" in the middle of last week. Legacy had the champagne on ice and remained confident until Wednesday night, but abortive talks at the weekend with the Duke of Westminster's consortium added to the perception of a consortium going nowhere. The normally ebullient Mr Bourne said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" as he prepared to throw in the towel and one colleague raised the possibility of suing the government to recover the \u00a38m cost of the bid. Downing Street is struggling to put a brave face on the latest dome disaster. No 10 talked up the prospect of a fresh surge of interest from \"70 groups and individuals\" even as it stressed Mr Blair's insistence that the dome cannot be pulled down for at least 15 years. Though Whitehall will not admit it, this may prove the crucial stumbling block - with some estimates that the cleared site would be worth at least three times the \u00a3125m offered by Legacy. Only two specific alternatives were cited by Downing Street - a possible renewed interest from Nomura in tandem with PY Gerbeau and a formidable consortium which includes the BBC, Madame Tussauds, Harvey Goldsmith, Grosvenor Estates (the Duke of Westminster's company), and the property firms of Quintain, Stanhope and Lend Lease. They were called \"heavyweight proposals\" but no indication was given that any bid was a frontrunner. There was evident dismay that Legacy had failed to \"move to closure\" and match its promises during its threemonth negotations as preferred bidder - but no admission either that Lord Falconer and his five-man ministerial team had overrated the Dublin-dominated consortium's capacity. Officials refused to be drawn on why the Legacy bid failed, but it was clear that the viability of its proposals rather than its cash offer was the vital factor. At Legacy, the team tried to make a joke of the disaster. \"We've opened a book on how long the government can hang on to the dome without selling it,\" quipped an adviser.

The new director will develop a marketing strategy that is likely to include the creation of a new brand for the library and its first ever corporate advertising. Lynne Brindley was appointed chief executive of the UK national library a year ago. She has now started to restructure the top layer of management and has created the new role of director of strategic marketing and communications. The new recruit will oversee 100 staff, consolidating the various existing marketing and communications departments - including press and PR. There are 70 marketers in Yorkshire, who work on the library's multi-million-pound document supply business. The remaining staff are based in the library's London headquarters in St Pancras. \"The library is gearing up to provide a lead in the new information-rich world and increase access to our collections,\" said a British Library spokesman. \"This is a complete refocus of our business. \"Building the brand and advertising will be on the agenda - we will look at all the options available. \"We need to find new ways of communicating our products and services to all our customers - users, stakeholders, the public and the media,\" he said. The internet will play a major part in the new vision for the library. The institution recently signed a deal with IBM, which will provide the infrastructure to support electronic collections.

The campaign will break next week in the US and on March 1 in the UK.

Three 30-second TV executions are entitled \"tubes\", \"lightbulbs\" and \"raising four\". The strapline will be: \"The Pentium 4 processor: the centre of your world.\" The adverts will emphasise the improved music, video and internet capabilities of PCs that incorporate the new processor. UK work will be co-ordinated by London-based Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper. Euro RSCG will produce additional TV work and develop a campaign comprising radio, in-store and internet advertising. The aim of Intel's latest campaign is to convince consumers to trade up their PCs for Pentium 4 models.

      "body": "<p>If Britain is still prevaricating over the euro in 2004, it will lose decisive influence over the political shaping of the European Union which is due to conclude at a special summit meeting that year. That is the judgment of Romano Prodi, president of the European commission, who told me yesterday: \"In theory, it might not be so. But in practice, if you don't fully participate in the family, your voice will be less heard. To be different makes you less important in the total decision-making process.\"</p> <p>Mr Prodi counselled against Britain trying any longer to influence the management of the euro. \"If you stay out, that's your choice,\" he said, \"but you can't then pretend to be in.\" It was already awkward for the UK to be excluded from the room, as a non-member of the euro-12, the committee that runs the currency. This was bound to have knock-on effects as the political agenda developed. While Mr Prodi would clearly like Britain to be a central player in all EU projects, his bleak assessment takes its place in what he regards as his respect for objective facts - rather than the visionary unrealism with which he is sometimes charged.</p> <p>Tainted as a woolly federalist, he insists on the primacy of fact. \"I am completely empirical,\" he said. As a former prime minister of Italy, he knows all about the need to impress people with facts, or fail to win their votes. Had Britain, he enquired, ceased to be empirical? The problem mystified him, as he looked at this country's European debates. \"Have you lost your tradition? I always consider Britain the most empirical country in the world. Look at the facts, you always say. But now you seem to have become theological. It is strange to see Germany and Italy as empirical nations, and the UK as a theological nation.\"</p> <p>Misplaced theological obsession, he considers, contributed to the British attitude to him, the commission and the proposals they jointly made about almost anything. For example, in the build-up to last year's Nice summit, he had made some rational proposals to deal with double taxation and tax fraud, which any sensible person would welcome. But Britain regarded anything to do with tax as untouchable. \"I couldn't get any discussion of the subject, in any part of British society.\"</p> <p>Although by temperament mild and scholarly, Mr Prodi also became exercised on the subject of his own lack of democratic credentials, a point made with increasing scorn by British ministers, notably Gordon Brown, when the commission challenges any of their decisions. Mr Prodi gets his credentials, he insists, through these very ministers.</p> <p>\"Tell them they appointed me,\" he said. \"I've been appointed by democratic leaders. I've been approved four times by the European parliament, twice by the old one and twice by the new. I report to it every month. Who else has been put in front of so many democratic tests? So if they call me a bureaucrat, I don't know what they are. Let them tell me one reason why I should be called a bureaucrat while they are democrats.\"</p> <p>Nor does he accept the conventional wisdom, stretching further than Britain, that the European parliament supplies an inadequate basis for democratic accountability. \"The parliament may get only half of Europe's voters out, but the American president is voted for by only half America as well.\"</p> <p>Besides, it is all a very slow process. The main difference between a conversation with Mr Prodi and paying daily attention to the British domestic argument is one of tone and perspective. For him, the integration of Europe is something that calls for patience, not only as regards enlargement, which is perhaps his strongest dream, but even for the existing members.</p> <p>His talk is littered with references to historic time. \"Democracy needs not years but decades to express itself,\" he said. It had taken five years to organise for the euro, and there were more to go to complete the single market. There wasn't yet a single market for services, nor for patents, a subject which, along with scientific research, is a particular focus of Mr Prodi's integrating ambitions. \"We shall take decades to construct a common area with common rules. But there is no doubt it will be in the service of the people.\"</p> <p>Selected areas of further integration are, in short, inevitable. They are the only empirical response to the facts of the modern world, he said. By which he means, at bottom, the danger of American hegemony brought about by economic globalisation. \"The only way to express ourselves in the new world,\" he said, \"is by being together. I don't like to be a colony. If we do not get together, we will disappear from world history.\"</p> <p>The model he takes is from his native Italy. In the 15th century, Italy dominated the world. \"Optical science, military science, therefore military strength, banking, finance. But then we split into mini-states. Italy disappeared from the geographical map. We couldn't cope with the discovery of America, and the new means of transport, the big ship.\" This was the historic fate Europe would be in danger of emulating if, while recognising the length of time the process would take, it did not cleave to an integrationist purpose.</p> <p>After a rocky first year, Mr Prodi is gaining confidence. Arguably, this reached a peak with his willingness to beard the British parliamentary lobby journalists at their own trough yesterday. He now prides himself on launching the 2004 constitutional argument months before Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, and is beginning to find his speeches reported more seriously.</p> <p>He is also prepared to do battle for his much reviled commission. That struggle is in the balance. The Brussels reforms which Neil Kinnock is seeking to push through are coming up against a combination of trade union and national job-protectionism. To Mr Prodi, there's an adamantine clarity about the commission's own historic importance, which seems to cause him less intellectual or emotional doubt than the scathing verdicts heard in London and Paris might indicate. \"To destroy the commission is to destroy Europe,\" he said. \"How many times have people tried to fight against history and lost?\" He sees what he terms \"the failure of Nice\" - the December EU summit that made minimal progress towards further integration - as vindicating his vision of the facts.</p> <p>But the British problem remains. Last time he was here, he left for Milan, only to be accosted at the airport with a demand for his ID card, a document now just about redundant within the continental EU. The president protested. \"But you have travelled from London,\" said the Italian immigration officer. To or from London, passports must be produced.</p> <p>Suddenly Mr Prodi felt the full impact of British exceptionalism. Like the currency, open borders could not be rejected without a price. \"To be different in such basic facts,\" he told me rather sadly, \"just makes you less important in the exercise of power. I don't like it. But it's your decision.\"</p>",

To be different makes you less important in the total decision-making process.\" Mr Prodi counselled against Britain trying any longer to influence the management of the euro. \"If you stay out, that's your choice,\" he said, \"but you can't then pretend to be in.\" It was already awkward for the UK to be excluded from the room, as a non-member of the euro-12, the committee that runs the currency. This was bound to have knock-on effects as the political agenda developed. While Mr Prodi would clearly like Britain to be a central player in all EU projects, his bleak assessment takes its place in what he regards as his respect for objective facts - rather than the visionary unrealism with which he is sometimes charged. Tainted as a woolly federalist, he insists on the primacy of fact. \"I am completely empirical,\" he said. As a former prime minister of Italy, he knows all about the need to impress people with facts, or fail to win their votes. Had Britain, he enquired, ceased to be empirical? The problem mystified him, as he looked at this country's European debates. \"Have you lost your tradition? I always consider Britain the most empirical country in the world. Look at the facts, you always say. But now you seem to have become theological. It is strange to see Germany and Italy as empirical nations, and the UK as a theological nation.\" Misplaced theological obsession, he considers, contributed to the British attitude to him, the commission and the proposals they jointly made about almost anything. For example, in the build-up to last year's Nice summit, he had made some rational proposals to deal with double taxation and tax fraud, which any sensible person would welcome. But Britain regarded anything to do with tax as untouchable. \"I couldn't get any discussion of the subject, in any part of British society.\" Although by temperament mild and scholarly, Mr Prodi also became exercised on the subject of his own lack of democratic credentials, a point made with increasing scorn by British ministers, notably Gordon Brown, when the commission challenges any of their decisions. Mr Prodi gets his credentials, he insists, through these very ministers. \"Tell them they appointed me,\" he said. \"I've been appointed by democratic leaders. I've been approved four times by the European parliament, twice by the old one and twice by the new. I report to it every month. Who else has been put in front of so many democratic tests? So if they call me a bureaucrat, I don't know what they are. Let them tell me one reason why I should be called a bureaucrat while they are democrats.\" Nor does he accept the conventional wisdom, stretching further than Britain, that the European parliament supplies an inadequate basis for democratic accountability. \"The parliament may get only half of Europe's voters out, but the American president is voted for by only half America as well.\" Besides, it is all a very slow process. The main difference between a conversation with Mr Prodi and paying daily attention to the British domestic argument is one of tone and perspective. For him, the integration of Europe is something that calls for patience, not only as regards enlargement, which is perhaps his strongest dream, but even for the existing members. His talk is littered with references to historic time. \"Democracy needs not years but decades to express itself,\" he said. It had taken five years to organise for the euro, and there were more to go to complete the single market. There wasn't yet a single market for services, nor for patents, a subject which, along with scientific research, is a particular focus of Mr Prodi's integrating ambitions. \"We shall take decades to construct a common area with common rules. But there is no doubt it will be in the service of the people.\" Selected areas of further integration are, in short, inevitable. They are the only empirical response to the facts of the modern world, he said. By which he means, at bottom, the danger of American hegemony brought about by economic globalisation. \"The only way to express ourselves in the new world,\" he said, \"is by being together. I don't like to be a colony. If we do not get together, we will disappear from world history.\" The model he takes is from his native Italy. In the 15th century, Italy dominated the world. \"Optical science, military science, therefore military strength, banking, finance. But then we split into mini-states. Italy disappeared from the geographical map. We couldn't cope with the discovery of America, and the new means of transport, the big ship.\" This was the historic fate Europe would be in danger of emulating if, while recognising the length of time the process would take, it did not cleave to an integrationist purpose. After a rocky first year, Mr Prodi is gaining confidence. Arguably, this reached a peak with his willingness to beard the British parliamentary lobby journalists at their own trough yesterday. He now prides himself on launching the 2004 constitutional argument months before Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, and is beginning to find his speeches reported more seriously. He is also prepared to do battle for his much reviled commission. That struggle is in the balance. The Brussels reforms which Neil Kinnock is seeking to push through are coming up against a combination of trade union and national job-protectionism. To Mr Prodi, there's an adamantine clarity about the commission's own historic importance, which seems to cause him less intellectual or emotional doubt than the scathing verdicts heard in London and Paris might indicate. \"To destroy the commission is to destroy Europe,\" he said. \"How many times have people tried to fight against history and lost?\" He sees what he terms \"the failure of Nice\" - the December EU summit that made minimal progress towards further integration - as vindicating his vision of the facts. But the British problem remains. Last time he was here, he left for Milan, only to be accosted at the airport with a demand for his ID card, a document now just about redundant within the continental EU. The president protested. \"But you have travelled from London,\" said the Italian immigration officer. To or from London, passports must be produced. Suddenly Mr Prodi felt the full impact of British exceptionalism. Like the currency, open borders could not be rejected without a price. \"To be different in such basic facts,\" he told me rather sadly, \"just makes you less important in the exercise of power. I don't like it. But it's your decision.\"",

Catty speculation ran rife about the exact nature of their nuptial arrangements, and their supposed pertinence to Kidman's green-card status.

The principles are simple: control the flow of information; say nothing; never apologise, never explain; if the coverage you receive is unfavourable, cut off the offending journalists or media outlets from \"access\". </p> <p>Two things will arise naturally from this policy.

Reagan ran a \"Hollywood presidency\" and deployed news-management techniques honed in California state politics during his stint as governor. Hollywood happily adopted them wholesale. I've borne the brunt of these practices, particularly in the months on the junket circuit a few years ago. Junkets are studio-backed affairs in which journalists are flown in en masse and housed, fed and watered in LA hotels that cater to the junket trade. </p> <p>They will be shepherded from one suite to another, meeting stars and directors for 15-minute blocks of time. You will be the only reporter from your \"market\". Thus I was surrounded by Danes, Italians and Scandinavians, many of whom were practising the approved form of entertainment journalism that requires no combative instincts and almost demands cinematic illiteracy. The gently lobbed questions rarely rose above the level of \"What was it like working with a great star like him/her?\" The answers were delivered in the lingua franca of Hollywood bullshit: \"What an amazing, magnificent, talented, generous, humanitarian artist\" (rough translation - \"I'd gas myself before working with that arsehole again\"). I tried some mild rough stuff a few times - and was rewarded with pissed-off household names glaring at me, followed shortly thereafter by spittle-flecked bollockings from pink-faced publicists. </p> <p>When I was removed from a perfectly amicable interview once, it was discovered that my employer wouldn't give some micro-star a cover story, I decided I was through with junkets for good. </p> <p>But media coverage is more likely to arrive courtesy of journalists who make a living on the junket circuit, who need to maintain cordial, uncritical relationships with studio publicists to pay the rent, and who are providing editors with exactly the kind of glorified PR they've asked for.

It's out of control - it's a seller's market.\" </p> <p>They sell. We buy. The garbage piles up. The cycle continues. I have an idle reverie about how to end it. The entire Hollywood press corps goes on strike and refuses to participate in any mutual back-scratching. We decline to attend studio press events, review any movies or cover Tinseltown.

      "byline": "Peter Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So much has happened since Dr Hannibal Lecter murmured his farewells to agent Clarice Starling over the phone in 1991. Jeffrey Dahmer, the most prominent of America's un-charming, un-cultured serial killers, has been beaten to death in Portage state prison, Wisconsin, by another inmate, without benefit of chianti or fava beans. British enthusiasm for psychological profiling as the new rock'n'roll came to an embarrassed halt with the collapse of the Colin Stagg prosecution over the Wimbledon Common murder.</p> <p>And by 1993, chilled by the atmosphere following the Jamie Bulger case, Anthony Hopkins was saying: \"We are living in an age of such horrors, and there are such terrifying films coming out, that I think it might be time to say: 'Enough is enough'. I don't think glorifying somebody like Lecter is a very good idea. It was an interesting portrait of the character \u2013 but let's not go on.\"</p> <p>Times have changed. The moral anxiety of the 1990s has receded, along with our saucer-eyed credulity about the science of forensic psychology. The show goes on; Hannibal goes on. But he has returned as the hero, not of a serious psycho-thriller, but a Guignol horror comedy: sleek, fast-moving, more than a little absurd.</p> <p>Clariiiiiiice is now at the peak of her brilliant career at the Bureau. But a bungled drug raid (not her fault) results in ignominy and leads to Dr Lecter himself getting back in touch. He may be a star of the FBI website (and none of us had heard of websites in 1991) but he chooses the most quaintly old-fashioned means possible: perfumed writing paper. He is in Florence, luxuriating in a Jamesian torpor in that ancient city of violence, cunning and refinement, and from afar he experiences in Clarice's distress a resurgence of his twisted gallantry and appalling appetites.</p> <p>Julianne Moore takes over from Jodie Foster as Clarice and she does the quasi-military jogging-through-the-woods thing, familiar from the first time around, ploughing along with her Titian hair in a bright ponytail flopping from side to side. For action sequences, she can more or less carry off the combination of T-shirt, combats and handgun. But let's face it, neither Clarice nor Julianne is getting any younger. So Moore seems happier bringing a new, languorous sensuality to Clarice's personality \u2013 a sexy woman-of-the-world maturity \u2013 most prominently when she reclines on a bed in a sexy gown, drugged up with morphine, while Dr Lecter is downstairs in the kitchen rustling up something unspeakable.</p> <p>All that can be said of Anthony Hopkins is that he gives a showstopping turn at the centre of the picture. Ridley Scott does an expert job of \u2013 well, not directing him as such, but organising the flash-bang pyrotechnics around his reptilian yet bull-like figure, and just letting Hopkins get on with it.</p> <p>Then there's that voice . It was always a mixture of Blanche Dubois and Richard III as spoken by Hopkins's first employer, Laurence Olivier. Now Blanche has got the upper hand. It's gamey, stagey, super camp: and distinctly un-American. (Despite being one of Baltimore's most famous products \u2013 along with Edgar Allan Poe and John Waters \u2013 Dr Lecter teasingly denies being American. In his menacing playfulness Hannibal is quite similar to Hopkins's fondly remembered stage performance as the Murdochesque newspaper proprietor in Howard Brenton and David Hare's Pravda.</p> <p>Hopkins does not really look any older than when we last saw him as Dr Lecter, and he is one of those extraordinary actors whose age is indeterminate \u2013 now playing a character hardly different in age to the old war criminal he played in the TV series QB VII in 1974. The disappointment for Hannibal fans is that at no stage does Hopkins do that extraordinary rattlesnake-hiss with his tongue against his top teeth. On the loose, moreover, Hannibal loses some of the awful glamour he had when he was, for the want of a better word, restrained, and he can't do any of the forced encounters with Clarice that made Jonathan Demme's 1991 movie so interesting.</p> <p>Like a vampire, Dr Lecter is at his best indoors, in darkness, or in the gloom of Florence's cloisters, where he affects sunglasses and a jaunty panama. He lectures on art history; he plays the Goldberg Variations. (In Hannibal 2, I'd like to hear him, in this high culture mode, read aloud from Ash Wednesday: \"Lady, three white leopards sat under a juniper tree/In the cool of the day, having fed to satiety/On my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained/In the hollow round of my skull.\")</p> <p>Speaking of which, we critics are forbidden on pain of being chomped from revealing the grisly finale. But anyone could see that the crooked justice department official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) is coming to a bad end. Not merely does he come on to Clarice in the most ungentlemanly way possible, but seriously disses Hannibal \u2013 calling him gay, of all the slanderous things! Krendler is certainly punished for the offensive assumptions underpinning that remark, and Dr Lecter's culinary predilections are given full and horrible expression. Ridley Scott has made a quite a meal of all this. But in 1991 Demme made it an intricate Le Caprice creation. This one leaves open the possibility of any number of sequels, like a franchise. I'm not sure I want fries with that.</p>",

British enthusiasm for psychological profiling as the new rock'n'roll came to an embarrassed halt with the collapse of the Colin Stagg prosecution over the Wimbledon Common murder. And by 1993, chilled by the atmosphere following the Jamie Bulger case, Anthony Hopkins was saying: \"We are living in an age of such horrors, and there are such terrifying films coming out, that I think it might be time to say: 'Enough is enough'. I don't think glorifying somebody like Lecter is a very good idea. It was an interesting portrait of the character \u2013 but let's not go on.\" Times have changed. The moral anxiety of the 1990s has receded, along with our saucer-eyed credulity about the science of forensic psychology. The show goes on; Hannibal goes on. But he has returned as the hero, not of a serious psycho-thriller, but a Guignol horror comedy: sleek, fast-moving, more than a little absurd. Clariiiiiiice is now at the peak of her brilliant career at the Bureau. But a bungled drug raid (not her fault) results in ignominy and leads to Dr Lecter himself getting back in touch. He may be a star of the FBI website (and none of us had heard of websites in 1991) but he chooses the most quaintly old-fashioned means possible: perfumed writing paper. He is in Florence, luxuriating in a Jamesian torpor in that ancient city of violence, cunning and refinement, and from afar he experiences in Clarice's distress a resurgence of his twisted gallantry and appalling appetites. Julianne Moore takes over from Jodie Foster as Clarice and she does the quasi-military jogging-through-the-woods thing, familiar from the first time around, ploughing along with her Titian hair in a bright ponytail flopping from side to side. For action sequences, she can more or less carry off the combination of T-shirt, combats and handgun. But let's face it, neither Clarice nor Julianne is getting any younger. So Moore seems happier bringing a new, languorous sensuality to Clarice's personality \u2013 a sexy woman-of-the-world maturity \u2013 most prominently when she reclines on a bed in a sexy gown, drugged up with morphine, while Dr Lecter is downstairs in the kitchen rustling up something unspeakable. All that can be said of Anthony Hopkins is that he gives a showstopping turn at the centre of the picture. Ridley Scott does an expert job of \u2013 well, not directing him as such, but organising the flash-bang pyrotechnics around his reptilian yet bull-like figure, and just letting Hopkins get on with it. Then there's that voice . It was always a mixture of Blanche Dubois and Richard III as spoken by Hopkins's first employer, Laurence Olivier. Now Blanche has got the upper hand. It's gamey, stagey, super camp: and distinctly un-American. (Despite being one of Baltimore's most famous products \u2013 along with Edgar Allan Poe and John Waters \u2013 Dr Lecter teasingly denies being American. In his menacing playfulness Hannibal is quite similar to Hopkins's fondly remembered stage performance as the Murdochesque newspaper proprietor in Howard Brenton and David Hare's Pravda. Hopkins does not really look any older than when we last saw him as Dr Lecter, and he is one of those extraordinary actors whose age is indeterminate \u2013 now playing a character hardly different in age to the old war criminal he played in the TV series QB VII in 1974. The disappointment for Hannibal fans is that at no stage does Hopkins do that extraordinary rattlesnake-hiss with his tongue against his top teeth. On the loose, moreover, Hannibal loses some of the awful glamour he had when he was, for the want of a better word, restrained, and he can't do any of the forced encounters with Clarice that made Jonathan Demme's 1991 movie so interesting. Like a vampire, Dr Lecter is at his best indoors, in darkness, or in the gloom of Florence's cloisters, where he affects sunglasses and a jaunty panama. He lectures on art history; he plays the Goldberg Variations. (In Hannibal 2, I'd like to hear him, in this high culture mode, read aloud from Ash Wednesday: \"Lady, three white leopards sat under a juniper tree/In the cool of the day, having fed to satiety/On my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained/In the hollow round of my skull.\") Speaking of which, we critics are forbidden on pain of being chomped from revealing the grisly finale. But anyone could see that the crooked justice department official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) is coming to a bad end. Not merely does he come on to Clarice in the most ungentlemanly way possible, but seriously disses Hannibal \u2013 calling him gay, of all the slanderous things! Krendler is certainly punished for the offensive assumptions underpinning that remark, and Dr Lecter's culinary predilections are given full and horrible expression. Ridley Scott has made a quite a meal of all this. But in 1991 Demme made it an intricate Le Caprice creation. This one leaves open the possibility of any number of sequels, like a franchise. I'm not sure I want fries with that.",

      "bodyText": "MPs are to introduce sweeping changes to the rules governing the election of the Commons Speaker to avoid a repeat of last year's fiasco when it took nearly seven hours to elect Michael Martin to the post. In the most radical reform of the election rules in centuries, MPs are expected to choose their next Speaker by secret ballot. Candidates will only be able to stand if they are nominated by 12 other MPs, three of who must come from another party. The Commons procedure committee called for the changes after admitting that the system for electing a speaker was \"fundamentally flawed\". The House of Commons was widely criticised last October when MPs took just under seven hours to elect Mr Martin, the Labour MP for Glasgow Springburn, to succeeed Betty Boothroyd. Mr Martin finally took the chair at 9.20pm on the night of October 23 - the debate had started at 2.30pm - after MPs voted on a total of 11 candidates, each of whom made a lengthy speech after being proposed and seconded. Sir Edward Heath, the 84-yar-old former prime minister who presided over the election in his role as father of the house, was criticised during the debate for resisting backbench calls to hold a ballot. Sir Edward insisted that he could not change Commons procedures on the hoof. The events surrounding Mr Martin's election descended into farce when a Labour MP later admitted that he bet \u00a3200 on Mr Martin's election at odds of 20-1, giving him \u00a33,400. Frank Roy, MP for Motherwell and Wishaw, was censured by the parliamentary standards watchdog. Under the committee's proposals, the Commons will break with convention and elect the speaker by an \"exhaustive\" secret ballot system. If a candidate received 50% of the vote, he or she would be automatically elected. If no candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes would be eliminated and another vote held until a winner emerged. The committee's proposal will dismay parliamentary traditionalists who believe that all votes at Westminster should be open to ensure that MPs are accountable to their constituents. However, MPs on the procedure committee said there was no danger that their proposal would change normal Commons votes. \"We note the long developing tradition that this pre-eminently is a matter for the house and not for the government or the party leaderships,\" the MPs concluded. This was seen as a coded rebuke to the Labour whips who tried unsuccessfully to pressurise their backbenchers to support the Tory MP, Sir George Young. The MPs also called for future elections to be presided over by the clerk of the house - the most senior official in the Commons - rather than the father of the house, a title which denotes the longest serving MP. This is in line with the system which was in force before the last changes to the rules were made in 1972. Members of the procedure committee insisted that their report did not question the legitimacy of Mr Martin, saying that he would still have been elected if their rules had been in force. However, their recommendation that an aspiring Speaker should be nominated by three MPs from another party is designed to avoid a repeat of the partisan nature of the last election. Mr Martin was the only candidate in the election who was proposed and seconded only by MPs from his own party. In a sign of the modest modernising spirit of today's commons, the committee also recommended reforming a quirky tradition of the Speaker's election. The report said a new Speaker should decide whether he or she wants to be \"dragged\" to the chair to denote their supposed unwillingness to take up the job in the light of the fate of nine speakers who lost their heads in the course of their duties. MPs will vote on the committee's recommendations.",

The crisis of confidence was not limited to El Salvador, he added. Rather, it was \"the consequence of a global situation where you have a recurrence of natural disasters or manmade disasters that create stress on the international community's response to this situation\". Salvadorean officials complained after the first earthquake on January 13 that only $2m (about \u00a31.4m) had been received in aid. Aid workers say that more than 15% of the country's 6m inhabitants have been affected by the disasters, the second of which struck on Sunday. As well as building houses for the more than 700,000 homeless, major work will be needed on the main roads: a section of the PanAmerican highway, which links El Salvador with neighbouring Honduras and Nicaragua, collapsed on Sunday. With a national disaster budget of less than $2.2m, the government had planned to seek a large slice of the $1bn estimated reconstruction costs of the first quake at a meeting of donor countries in Madrid on March 7. It is too early to say how much more will now be needed; in one province more than two-thirds of the housing was destroyed. Now that rescuers are close to giving up hope of finding more survivors, a poignant focus of the nation's grief has been the funeral of the children who died beneath the walls of their parish school in the town of Candelaria.

Mr Clinton issued his denial as a federal prosecutor in New York was authorised by the justice department to investigate whether money played a part in the pardoning of Mr Rich on January 20. US attorney Mary Jo White, a Clinton appointee, is expected to examine bank and telephone records for evidence of illegal conduct by Mr Rich and his supporters, as well as by Mr Clinton himself. \"As I have said repeatedly, I made the decision to pardon Marc Rich based on what I thought was the right thing to do,\" Mr Clinton's statement said. \"Any suggestions that improper factors, including fundraising for the Democratic national committee or my library had anything to do with the decision, are absolutely false.

Mr Giuliani secured the original 51-count indictment of Mr Rich in September 1983 on charges of arms trading, fraud and $48m (\u00a333m) tax evasion. The case is still the biggest tax evasion prosecution in US history. Ms White was not consulted about the Rich pardon and was reportedly \"livid\" when news of it emerged. Mr Rich and his co-defendant Pincus Green fled to Switzerland before the case went to court more than 17 years ago, and both men have remained there ever since, while continuing to expand their hugely profitable commodities trading businesses. The US authorities have been involved in regular talks for the past 17 years to try to resolve the Rich case, but proposed deals have fallen through because Mr Rich refused to serve a jail sentence. Early last year Ms White refused to negotiate with Mr Rich, saying that it would \"give defendants an incentive to flee [from the US]\". Mr Rich has now abandoned his US citizenship. In 1993 his 27-year marriage to the former Denise Eisenberg broke up. The key issues in the new investigation are why and how Mr Clinton added Mr Rich's name to the list of 141 presidential pardons. After Mrs Rich returned to the US with her three daughters in the mid-90s, she made a glittering career as a Manhattan socialite and a courtier at the Clinton White House, and became a major donor to the Democratic party. She gave it more than $500,000, and pledged at least $450,000 to Mr Clinton's presidential library fund.

Last year she also gave a set of two coffee tables and upholstered chairs to the Clintons, worth $7,735, which the former presidential couple took with them when they left the White House. Such support raises the question of whether Mrs Rich tried to buy her former husband's pardon, either with her own assets or with money transferred to her from Switzerland. Mrs Rich personally spoke to Mr Clinton twice. So far she has refused to testify on the grounds that she might incriminate herself. Other issues under scrutiny are the means employed by Mr Rich and his US lawyer Jack Quinn to orchestrate the behind-the-scenes lobbying which led to the pardon and, in particular, how the justice department and Ms White's office were kept in ignorance of it. Mr Quinn says he focused his main effort on Mr Rich's behalf by using his own access to the White House as a former counsel there and by encouraging prominent Israelis to pressure Mr Clinton. The former head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, Avner Azulay, said that former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres both spoke personally to Mr Clinton about Mr Rich's proposed pardon. Mr Azulay said he believed Mr Clinton granted the pardon because of Mr Rich's role in helping Jews get out of Ethiopia and Yemen. Mr Quinn said this week that he informed the deputy attorney-general Eric Holder on November 21 last year that he would send a pardon petition for Mr Rich to Mr Clinton, and that he sent a copy to Mr Holder on January 10. Mr Holder claimed this week that he had first learned about the petition on January 19, a day before the pardon was issued, and that he assumed the Rich case had already been referred to his department and to the New York prosecutor's office. But it emerged on Wednesday that the first notification came shortly after midnight on January 20. The presidential pardon power is enshrined in the constitution. In all, Mr Clinton issued 395 pardons in eight years, compared with 393 issued by Ronald Reagan in his two White House terms.

In the town's suburban cemetery, dotted with palm trees and surrounded by fields of pungent grapefruit trees, scores of people mourned the loss of their fellow soldiers and friends. Khalil Abu Olbeh's attack on a crowded bus stop south of Tel Aviv was the deadliest in Israel in nearly four years. Seven Israeli soldiers, four of them women, and a civilian, were killed. Two, Sergeants Rachel Levy, and Kochava Polanski, both 19, were buried at Ashkelon yesterday. Simcha Shetrit, 30, was buried in Rishon Letzion yesterday and Sergeants David Elouz, 21 and Ofir Magidish, 20 were buried a military cemetery on Wednesday. Sergeant Julie Weiner, 21, who left France to live with an \"adopted family\" on a kibbutz so that she could explore life in Israel, will be buried in Jerusalem today. In Ashkelon teenage soldiers and elderly Russian immigrants huddled together. \"Why, why?\" they chanted. \"Why did they do this?\" Palestinian officials said that \"Israeli aggressions\" were to blame for the attack. It followed an Israeli helicopter missile strike on Tuesday which killed Massoud Ayad, 54, a member of Yasser Arafat's elite security guard claimed by Israel to be an agent of the Hizbullah guerrilla organisation in Lebanon. The conflict showed no signs of respite yesterday. The Israeli army said a man was shot as soldiers foiled an attempt by armed Palestinians to enter houses in the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom, in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians identified him as Nasser Hassanat, 23, a resident of the Deir El Balah refugee camp. He was not in uniform but allegedly carried documents identifying him as a member of the Palestinian preventative security service. Thousands of Arab protesters marched at his funeral in Gaza yesterday. Israel tightened its blockade of Palestinian areas after the bus stop killings, which brough the violence to a new peak in the week since the rightwing Likud party leader Ariel Sharon was elected. As Israelis buried their dead yesterday, Mr Sharon and his predecessor, Ehud Barak, pressed ahead with their efforts to for a joint government. Mr Barak, considered by many as the man who has landed Israelis in this mini-war, said he had conditionally accepted Mr Bark's offer to join a unity government. \"We don't need Barak around any more. He has caused more harm that good,\" said Kfir Melkhaim, 20, a friend of one of the dead women soldiers. \"Sharon is what we need. He must use force on the Arabs. Maybe he could just get rid of them altogether. Maybe that would solve the problem.\"",

      "body": "<p>A symmetrical war is the name given to it by military theorists. What it comes down to in real life is this: one man killed by precision munitions fired from a state of the art helicopter in one place, and eight young men and women crushed to death by an ordinary diesel bus in another place about 50 miles away. One was carefully planned, the other may have been hardly planned at all. One was the act of a strong state and a strong army, the other an act typical of a weak society. But, different though they were, they could not have been better timed, as Ariel Sharon prepares for power, to illustrate not just the limitations of force in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the way in which its use constantly defeats any rational purpose.</p> <p>For what will happen as a consequence of these two acts? Will the thought that they might be selectively assassinated by the Israelis make Palestinian leaders shrink from organising or encouraging attacks? All that can be said is that it never has in the past, and that the effect of assassinations - and over the years there have been so many, in Beirut, Tunis, Malta, and many other places, as well as in the West Bank and Gaza - has nearly always had the reverse effect, leading to more, rather than less, violence. Has the disappearance from the scene of the 20 or so men the Israelis are said to have targeted and killed in the troubles that began last September changed anything for the better? The truth, rather, is that in a situation like the one in which the Palestinians find themselves there is no shortage of men, driven by both anger and ambition, anxious to step into the shoes of people who are killed.</p> <p>Some figures, notably Arafat himself, are irreplaceable, and one prominent Israeli this week took the argument to its reductive end by raising the possibility that the Israelis might destroy the Palestinian Authority itself, not necessarily by assassination but by making it impossible for it to function at all. That idea will not have many followers in any Israeli government, which desperately needs somebody to talk to on the other side and understands in practice, whatever spokesmen say in public, that there are some restraints being imposed by the Authority on Palestinian military action. Still, the decapitation of the enemy is an old Israeli fantasy and remains a temptation. What the assassinations show is that Israeli policy is driven not by what it may be rationally useful to do but rather merely by what can be done. All kinds of options, from full-scale bombardments of areas from which they are fired on to the reoccupation of Palestinian towns, are ruled out, at least for the moment. But assassinations are technically possible, not too risky for the forces involved, and not too costly politically, in spite of international protests. So they are done - because \"something\" has to be done.</p> <p>What will follow the bus attack? First, it is probable that the Egged bus company will sack many, or all, of the few Gaza and West Bank men it still employs, and that other Israeli firms will do the same, so that, regardless of how long the borders are sealed or virtually sealed, there will be, even if the restrictions are eased, even less work for Palestinians in Israel. There is madness here, too: 30,000 Gaza workers commuted to Israel before last September. It was work useful to Israel, but vital to Gaza, which has little industry or agriculture of its own. Now the United Nations estimates that unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza is nearly 40% - higher in Gaza - and this is probably an underestimate. That there is any work at all in Gaza and the West Bank is largely due to the money the international community is putting in, including emergency payment of civil service salaries. How can it help Israel, one might ask, that in Gaza, where half the population is under 14, there should be almost no jobs and no possibilities for advancement, however modest, except in the single field of fighting Israelis ?</p> <p>If Israel's main problem in negotations with the Palestinians was, and remains, that it is too strong, then that is also its main problem in the state of quasi-war that now exists. Strength does not necessarily produce effective policies, and it may rule out others that might be effective. One of Israel's leading intellectuals, the military writer Martin van Creveld, has been incisive on the subject of the disadvantages of strength. \"A war waged by the strong against the weak,\" he wrote, \"is problematic for that very reason ... Fighting the weak demeans those who engage in it and therefore alienates its own purpose. He who loses out to the weak loses; he who triumphs over the weak also loses. In such an enterprise there can be neither profit nor honour.\"</p> <p>I t was in part a perception of this problem which led Israel, after the first intifada, down the road of negotiations, if not far enough. And it is in part a perception of this problem that guides the Palestinians when they provoke the Israelis into actions that they believe will shame them before the world community and in their own eyes.</p> <p>When military establishments are asked by governments, particularly by governments headed by ex-generals, for suggestions as to what to do, they tend to come up with answers, because that is their job. But the frustrating truth is that both know the answers are no good. Reoccupation would, the experts say, be relatively easy, although casualties might be quite high. Three or four days of tough fighting might be tolerable if it were not for the international condemnation that would follow, the confirmed enmity of the Muslim world, and even more the years of hell holding the Palestinians down that would then lie before Israel. Separation with coercive population transfers and the liquidation of outlying settlements? Harder to do, because it would involve deportations, somewhat easier to maintain, but you would still have to have military positions deep in Palestinian territory, and you would still be an island in a sea of rancour. And what if, at the end of a long period, strategic realities do shift, and Israel ceases to be the strongest power in the region? Possible to deal with such a change when the background is one of a fair peace, concluded years before: not so easy if you are still at harsh odds with the Palestinians.</p> <p>That is why Yossi Beilin, the departing minister of justice and one of the Israelis who has done most for peace, is right to argue that to formally set aside the goal of a final settlement is wrong and dangerous.

      "bodyText": "A symmetrical war is the name given to it by military theorists. What it comes down to in real life is this: one man killed by precision munitions fired from a state of the art helicopter in one place, and eight young men and women crushed to death by an ordinary diesel bus in another place about 50 miles away. One was carefully planned, the other may have been hardly planned at all. One was the act of a strong state and a strong army, the other an act typical of a weak society. But, different though they were, they could not have been better timed, as Ariel Sharon prepares for power, to illustrate not just the limitations of force in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the way in which its use constantly defeats any rational purpose. For what will happen as a consequence of these two acts? Will the thought that they might be selectively assassinated by the Israelis make Palestinian leaders shrink from organising or encouraging attacks? All that can be said is that it never has in the past, and that the effect of assassinations - and over the years there have been so many, in Beirut, Tunis, Malta, and many other places, as well as in the West Bank and Gaza - has nearly always had the reverse effect, leading to more, rather than less, violence. Has the disappearance from the scene of the 20 or so men the Israelis are said to have targeted and killed in the troubles that began last September changed anything for the better? The truth, rather, is that in a situation like the one in which the Palestinians find themselves there is no shortage of men, driven by both anger and ambition, anxious to step into the shoes of people who are killed. Some figures, notably Arafat himself, are irreplaceable, and one prominent Israeli this week took the argument to its reductive end by raising the possibility that the Israelis might destroy the Palestinian Authority itself, not necessarily by assassination but by making it impossible for it to function at all. That idea will not have many followers in any Israeli government, which desperately needs somebody to talk to on the other side and understands in practice, whatever spokesmen say in public, that there are some restraints being imposed by the Authority on Palestinian military action. Still, the decapitation of the enemy is an old Israeli fantasy and remains a temptation. What the assassinations show is that Israeli policy is driven not by what it may be rationally useful to do but rather merely by what can be done. All kinds of options, from full-scale bombardments of areas from which they are fired on to the reoccupation of Palestinian towns, are ruled out, at least for the moment. But assassinations are technically possible, not too risky for the forces involved, and not too costly politically, in spite of international protests. So they are done - because \"something\" has to be done. What will follow the bus attack? First, it is probable that the Egged bus company will sack many, or all, of the few Gaza and West Bank men it still employs, and that other Israeli firms will do the same, so that, regardless of how long the borders are sealed or virtually sealed, there will be, even if the restrictions are eased, even less work for Palestinians in Israel. There is madness here, too: 30,000 Gaza workers commuted to Israel before last September. It was work useful to Israel, but vital to Gaza, which has little industry or agriculture of its own. Now the United Nations estimates that unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza is nearly 40% - higher in Gaza - and this is probably an underestimate. That there is any work at all in Gaza and the West Bank is largely due to the money the international community is putting in, including emergency payment of civil service salaries. How can it help Israel, one might ask, that in Gaza, where half the population is under 14, there should be almost no jobs and no possibilities for advancement, however modest, except in the single field of fighting Israelis ? If Israel's main problem in negotations with the Palestinians was, and remains, that it is too strong, then that is also its main problem in the state of quasi-war that now exists. Strength does not necessarily produce effective policies, and it may rule out others that might be effective. One of Israel's leading intellectuals, the military writer Martin van Creveld, has been incisive on the subject of the disadvantages of strength. \"A war waged by the strong against the weak,\" he wrote, \"is problematic for that very reason ... Fighting the weak demeans those who engage in it and therefore alienates its own purpose. He who loses out to the weak loses; he who triumphs over the weak also loses. In such an enterprise there can be neither profit nor honour.\" I t was in part a perception of this problem which led Israel, after the first intifada, down the road of negotiations, if not far enough. And it is in part a perception of this problem that guides the Palestinians when they provoke the Israelis into actions that they believe will shame them before the world community and in their own eyes. When military establishments are asked by governments, particularly by governments headed by ex-generals, for suggestions as to what to do, they tend to come up with answers, because that is their job. But the frustrating truth is that both know the answers are no good. Reoccupation would, the experts say, be relatively easy, although casualties might be quite high. Three or four days of tough fighting might be tolerable if it were not for the international condemnation that would follow, the confirmed enmity of the Muslim world, and even more the years of hell holding the Palestinians down that would then lie before Israel. Separation with coercive population transfers and the liquidation of outlying settlements? Harder to do, because it would involve deportations, somewhat easier to maintain, but you would still have to have military positions deep in Palestinian territory, and you would still be an island in a sea of rancour. And what if, at the end of a long period, strategic realities do shift, and Israel ceases to be the strongest power in the region? Possible to deal with such a change when the background is one of a fair peace, concluded years before: not so easy if you are still at harsh odds with the Palestinians. That is why Yossi Beilin, the departing minister of justice and one of the Israelis who has done most for peace, is right to argue that to formally set aside the goal of a final settlement is wrong and dangerous. There are no acceptable radical military options for Israel, and even Sharon seems to half see that. There is, meanwhile, no evidence that the present policy of limited confrontation, occasional assassination, and punitive economic measures will induce the Palestinians to agree to the interim settlement and the abandonment of any real effort to reach a final settlement which Sharon proposes. The reality is that while a final settlement was a desirable goal before the Camp David failure, it now represents the only way out of an increasingly desperate situation for both Israelis and Palestinians. martin.woollacott@guardian. co.uk",

Fluctuations in the oil price had less impact on BG because oil accounted for only 25% of its production. Although the group is the fifth largest gas supplier in Britain, it has only 9% of the home market, and about 90% of its UK sales are under long-term contracts with automatic annual price changes based on factors such as the price of oil.

These included the major Kashagan field in the Caspian sea, and reserves in Bolivia which, the group said, could provide the source of important new gas exports. By the year end, proved or probable reserves amounted to more than 3bn barrels of oil equivalent - giving the group sufficient reserves for the next 30 years at the current rate of production. During last year BG delivered the first gas from the Rosetta field, in offshore Egypt, and completed the second phase of Seabank power station near Bristol. It has also won clearance from the Trinidad government to open up a new gas province by developing BG-operated fields off the north coast.

I found myself weekending with him in Cornwall for research purposes in June 1998, when he offered me an expensive Cornetto, claiming that it would be \"just what the doctor ordered\".</p> <p>Call it instinct, call it integrity (and - yes - some of us still do possess a fair measure of that vital asset, you know!) but I simply wasn't prepared to accept a free ice-cream from this man. To my horror, I was later to discover that, far from being medically recommended, a Cornetto is in fact full of calories, with a heavy ice-cream content, plus potentially debilitating wafers. Once again, I had cause to congratulate myself that I had seen through the man's evil underhand ploys.</p> <p>I was, I like to think, the first to condemn this wicked man's slippery wiles. Nor was I ever taken in by his claims to genius. As long ago as 1996, I wrote a profile of Mandelson in the Observer (\"New Labour's presiding genius\" January 5 1996) in which I had the courage to point out one or two glaring character faults. \"Beneath the charming and forceful exterior,\" I wrote - thus boldly indicating that he was a man who was not above using force to get his way - \"lies a sensitive and highly intelligent man.\" By skilfully employing that charged word - \"lies\" - I became the first journalist to question his relaxed attitude to the truth.</p> <p>I'm glad to say I never had lunch with the guy other than when strictly necessary, and then only between the hours of 12.30 and 3pm. Looking back, I always resented the way he would hand me the menu and ask me what I wanted to eat, and would I like something to drink, blah, blah: in other words, all the familiar ploys of deception we have come to recognise in monomaniacal control freaks. And at the end of the meal, he would sometimes motion his hand to his jacket pocket - a signal which I realise was now a covert means of \"buying me lunch\". Sorry, Peter - but I'm not so easily bought.</p> <p>More alert than my colleagues (sorry, guys!) I could see through these insincere questions to the dark heart that lay within. I am proud to say I never liked him in the first place. I deplored the way that, when the two of us were alone together, he would listen to tittle-tattle for hours on end when he must have known full well that not only was it disloyal to the victims but that both of us had more important things to do. And as I inferred as recently as December of last year (\"Brilliant Mandelson saves Northern Ireland\"), I always regarded his competence as secretary of state as highly questionable.</p> <p>We've all met his type in our workplace. They take a holier-than-thou position - but only when their victims cannot answer back. It is one of the less appealing characteristics of the Mandelson type that they kick people when they're down. The moment they see someone has fallen from grace and can be of no further use to them, they discard him. Then they dance on his grave, whooping and throwing their hands in the air - often claiming in the process that they never liked him in the first place. Believe me, it's not a pleasant sight.</p> <p>Personally, I like to live in a country that regards lying as a resigning offence. In that way, politicians like Mandelson bring out the best in journalists like me, for he reminds us that without our integrity, we are nothing.</p>",

Call it instinct, call it integrity (and - yes - some of us still do possess a fair measure of that vital asset, you know!) but I simply wasn't prepared to accept a free ice-cream from this man. To my horror, I was later to discover that, far from being medically recommended, a Cornetto is in fact full of calories, with a heavy ice-cream content, plus potentially debilitating wafers. Once again, I had cause to congratulate myself that I had seen through the man's evil underhand ploys. I was, I like to think, the first to condemn this wicked man's slippery wiles. Nor was I ever taken in by his claims to genius. As long ago as 1996, I wrote a profile of Mandelson in the Observer (\"New Labour's presiding genius\" January 5 1996) in which I had the courage to point out one or two glaring character faults. \"Beneath the charming and forceful exterior,\" I wrote - thus boldly indicating that he was a man who was not above using force to get his way - \"lies a sensitive and highly intelligent man.\" By skilfully employing that charged word - \"lies\" - I became the first journalist to question his relaxed attitude to the truth. I'm glad to say I never had lunch with the guy other than when strictly necessary, and then only between the hours of 12.30 and 3pm. Looking back, I always resented the way he would hand me the menu and ask me what I wanted to eat, and would I like something to drink, blah, blah: in other words, all the familiar ploys of deception we have come to recognise in monomaniacal control freaks. And at the end of the meal, he would sometimes motion his hand to his jacket pocket - a signal which I realise was now a covert means of \"buying me lunch\". Sorry, Peter - but I'm not so easily bought. More alert than my colleagues (sorry, guys!) I could see through these insincere questions to the dark heart that lay within. I am proud to say I never liked him in the first place. I deplored the way that, when the two of us were alone together, he would listen to tittle-tattle for hours on end when he must have known full well that not only was it disloyal to the victims but that both of us had more important things to do. And as I inferred as recently as December of last year (\"Brilliant Mandelson saves Northern Ireland\"), I always regarded his competence as secretary of state as highly questionable. We've all met his type in our workplace. They take a holier-than-thou position - but only when their victims cannot answer back. It is one of the less appealing characteristics of the Mandelson type that they kick people when they're down. The moment they see someone has fallen from grace and can be of no further use to them, they discard him. Then they dance on his grave, whooping and throwing their hands in the air - often claiming in the process that they never liked him in the first place. Believe me, it's not a pleasant sight. Personally, I like to live in a country that regards lying as a resigning offence. In that way, politicians like Mandelson bring out the best in journalists like me, for he reminds us that without our integrity, we are nothing.",

      "body": "<p>The Nicaraguan capital, Managua, recently witnessed a protest about globalisation - a protest with a difference. While thousands of activists were gathering in Porto Alegre in Brazil to call for a halt to free trade as promoted by the World Trade Organisation and similar bodies, Nicaraguan workers picketed the American embassy ... in favour of freer trade. They wanted an end to a campaign against sweatshops that has involved boycotting their products. Their livelihoods, they said, were under threat.</p> <p>American human rights groups see Nicaraguan workers being employed in appalling conditions, making jeans for department stores such as Wal-Mart and JC Penney. An ill effect of globalised trade, they say. But the Nicaraguan workers say that while their conditions are not great, they would rather have the sales and the jobs they bring.</p> <p>At issue is the attempt to enforce worldwide labour standards - the chart shows the International Labour Organisation's principles. Protest action along such lines helped derail attempts to launch a new round of trade talks in Seattle in 1999. Developing countries were dismayed when President Clinton arrived calling for such core labour standards to be incorporated into new agreements.</p> <p>India and Mexico argued that putting such principles in WTO agreements is disguised protectionism - another excuse for rich countries to keep their markets closed to goods from the third world. Developing countries threatened to walk out, hastening the collapse of the talks.</p> <p>Some economists argue that forcing poor countries to upgrade labour standards to first world levels is inappropriate. Jagdish Bhagwati says labour standards, unlike human rights, cannot be universalised. Instead they should reflect economic and cultural circumstances. Other economists say minimum standards are necessary to prevent workers being exploited. The question is what the minima should be and how they should be enforced.</p> <p>Incorporating global labour standards into WTO agreements is likely to get short shrift from the new Bush administration, which is not exactly friendly to unions. But while official American enthusiasm for labour standards has waned, consumer and student protest, particularly at the use of sweated labour by sportswear manufacturers, has been growing.</p> <p>But boycotts may do more harm than good. In 1993 American television broadcast pictures of Bangladeshi children making clothes for Wal-Mart. After a public outcry the store cancelled its contracts in Bangladesh and a senator proposed a bill to block imports of goods produced by child labour.</p> <p>Faced with losing one of its biggest markets, the Bangladesh garment manufacturers' association announced it would eliminate the use of child labour within four months. Thousands of children were sacked, many of whom then found work in more dangerous industries. Few returned to school because their families simply could not afford it.</p> <p>In the end the campaign against child labour in Bangladesh did have some positive results. Unicef, the United Nations children's agency, negotiated a voluntary code of standards with the factories and provided money to send some of the children back to school.</p> <p>Yet the incident illustrates another weakness of using boycotts of exports to raise labour standards in the third world: workers in the export sector usually enjoy better conditions than the vast majority of other third world workers who earn their livelihoods in the informal sector where there are no employment rights or health and safety provisions.</p> <p>In Nicaragua, the garment workers are getting paid well above the minimum wage. Many Bangladeshi women aspire to jobs in the Dhaka's clothing factories as an escape from rural poverty. Kevin Watkins of Oxfam says that a majority in the developing world are not working in the formal sector and they are not producing goods for export. \"There is no case you can point at where sanctions have improved labour standards. It's about a labour aristocracy in the north protecting its jobs and conditions.\"</p> <p>The National Labour Committee, a New York human rights group, which has brought a court case on behalf of Nicaraguan workers sacked by the Chentex jeans plant, agrees that boycotts are almost always counter-productive. It tells American companies not to drop sweatshop suppliers but to work for better conditions. Its approach has been to use the media to try to embarrass companies into putting pressure on their subsidiaries; it seems to have worked.</p> <p>Non-government organisations in the UK prefer to take a behind-the-scenes approach rather than naming and shaming the companies sourcing goods from dubious third world factories.

      "bodyText": "The Nicaraguan capital, Managua, recently witnessed a protest about globalisation - a protest with a difference. While thousands of activists were gathering in Porto Alegre in Brazil to call for a halt to free trade as promoted by the World Trade Organisation and similar bodies, Nicaraguan workers picketed the American embassy ... in favour of freer trade. They wanted an end to a campaign against sweatshops that has involved boycotting their products. Their livelihoods, they said, were under threat. American human rights groups see Nicaraguan workers being employed in appalling conditions, making jeans for department stores such as Wal-Mart and JC Penney. An ill effect of globalised trade, they say. But the Nicaraguan workers say that while their conditions are not great, they would rather have the sales and the jobs they bring. At issue is the attempt to enforce worldwide labour standards - the chart shows the International Labour Organisation's principles. Protest action along such lines helped derail attempts to launch a new round of trade talks in Seattle in 1999. Developing countries were dismayed when President Clinton arrived calling for such core labour standards to be incorporated into new agreements. India and Mexico argued that putting such principles in WTO agreements is disguised protectionism - another excuse for rich countries to keep their markets closed to goods from the third world. Developing countries threatened to walk out, hastening the collapse of the talks. Some economists argue that forcing poor countries to upgrade labour standards to first world levels is inappropriate. Jagdish Bhagwati says labour standards, unlike human rights, cannot be universalised. Instead they should reflect economic and cultural circumstances. Other economists say minimum standards are necessary to prevent workers being exploited. The question is what the minima should be and how they should be enforced. Incorporating global labour standards into WTO agreements is likely to get short shrift from the new Bush administration, which is not exactly friendly to unions. But while official American enthusiasm for labour standards has waned, consumer and student protest, particularly at the use of sweated labour by sportswear manufacturers, has been growing. But boycotts may do more harm than good. In 1993 American television broadcast pictures of Bangladeshi children making clothes for Wal-Mart. After a public outcry the store cancelled its contracts in Bangladesh and a senator proposed a bill to block imports of goods produced by child labour. Faced with losing one of its biggest markets, the Bangladesh garment manufacturers' association announced it would eliminate the use of child labour within four months. Thousands of children were sacked, many of whom then found work in more dangerous industries. Few returned to school because their families simply could not afford it. In the end the campaign against child labour in Bangladesh did have some positive results. Unicef, the United Nations children's agency, negotiated a voluntary code of standards with the factories and provided money to send some of the children back to school. Yet the incident illustrates another weakness of using boycotts of exports to raise labour standards in the third world: workers in the export sector usually enjoy better conditions than the vast majority of other third world workers who earn their livelihoods in the informal sector where there are no employment rights or health and safety provisions. In Nicaragua, the garment workers are getting paid well above the minimum wage. Many Bangladeshi women aspire to jobs in the Dhaka's clothing factories as an escape from rural poverty. Kevin Watkins of Oxfam says that a majority in the developing world are not working in the formal sector and they are not producing goods for export. \"There is no case you can point at where sanctions have improved labour standards. It's about a labour aristocracy in the north protecting its jobs and conditions.\" The National Labour Committee, a New York human rights group, which has brought a court case on behalf of Nicaraguan workers sacked by the Chentex jeans plant, agrees that boycotts are almost always counter-productive. It tells American companies not to drop sweatshop suppliers but to work for better conditions. Its approach has been to use the media to try to embarrass companies into putting pressure on their subsidiaries; it seems to have worked. Non-government organisations in the UK prefer to take a behind-the-scenes approach rather than naming and shaming the companies sourcing goods from dubious third world factories. Working in partnership with companies and unions with money from the Department for International Development, such NGOs have helped develop an \"ethical trading initiative\". This is a voluntary code which sets standards for retailers buying goods from the third world. Abuses in factories approved under the initiative are usually addressed by the company concerned before they become public. Voluntary codes may not satisfy the anti-globalisation lobby but they represent an approach workers in Managua who want to work might prefer. \u0095 Charlotte Denny is the Guardian's economics reporter. charlotte.denny@theguardian.com",

Unemployment - admittedly as measured by the controversial claimant count - is down to a 25-year low of 3.5% and the underlying rate of inflation at 1.8% is the lowest in Europe. If you add the rate of unemployment to the rate of inflation you get what economists call the \"misery index\". In the mid 1970s, when Labour was last in power and inflation was raging at over 20%, this index was over 30 points.

Mr Brown has also been helped by some reforms of the Thatcher period, particularly in the labour markets where Labour has been conspicuously slow in unravelling them.</p> <p>Where does he go now? There is only one way - to keep testing the limits of the new economy to see how far further unemployment can fall. On the International Labour Office's definition of unemployment (those looking for work and not just those claiming benefit) it is 1.56m rather than 1m. If you include others not in either definition (such as people with family responsibilities who would like to work, or some of those claiming long-term sickness benefit who could be working), the real total of unemployed people could be over 3m. This is not to deny that there are serious skill shortages in specialised areas. But in terms of continued economic growth, the existence of a submerged reservoir of unemployed could be a source of strength. During the 1950s and early 1960s it was the norm to have unemployment at under 500,000 or even below 300,000. Maybe recent high inflation was merely a delayed response to the explosion of oil prices during the 1970s. Why can't we get back to the unemployment rates of the post-war era? We won't know until we try, and, unless we try, we will never know. Gordon Brown should continue his gradualist policy of nudging unemployment down until it can realistically go down no further. The fall to below a million which is expected next month should be seen not as the end of the road but as a fresh start.</p>",

Negotiations start next month at the WTO on the general agreement on trade in services. This free trade agreement locks in place the privatisation and deregulation of public services, making them effectively irreversible. It has been heavily lobbied for by many of the same companies that have filled their pockets while failing to deliver adequate essential services. Freedland will find the grip of multinational companies on these services difficult to release while the UK government is committed to an agreement that the EU boasts is \"an instrument for the benefit of business\".

      "body": "<p>Even the \u00fcber-elite of European aristocracy can have their holidays spoiled. Princess Caroline of Monaco was flown to hospital this week for emergency keyhole surgery on her knee after being flattened on the ski slopes of the exclusive Austrian resort of Zuers by a man one local resident described as a \"piste-lout\".</p> <p>Her husband, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, flew the 32 miles to a private clinic with his wife. Prince Ernst, who last summer was photographed urinating against the Turkish pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hanover and later called a journalist interviewing him about it a \"fat arse\", returned with the couple's daughter Alexandra to the five-star Loruenser Hotel where the family were staying.</p> <p>There is something overwhelming about the recipe of wealth, skiing and cold, crisp mountain air - with a dash of risk thrown in. James Bond never infiltrated himself into a corporate box at Old Trafford, but would find any excuse to whiz down a mountainside on planks with a range of villains shooting from the hip as they slalomed after him. Hence the rush of punters in the 70s to sign up on package ski holidays to Bulgaria for a taste of that exoticism.</p> <p>But Princess Caroline was in some ways very lucky. The list of celebrities who have met an untimely end while skiing includes Michael Kennedy, killed on New Year's Eve 1997 when he collided with a tree in Aspen, and the singer turned Republican politician Sonny Bono, who did something very similar six days later. Even our own royalty is not immune, with Prince Charles narrowly escaping death in an avalanche at Klosters that swept away his bodyguard, Major Hugh Lindsay. And while the celebrities get the biggest headlines, the death toll on the general public is equally remorseless.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Nathan Hall, a 22-year-old former lift operator at Vail in Colorado, was sentenced to 90 days in jail for a fatal collision in 1997 with British-born Alan Cobb, 33, who had been skiing with his fiancee Christi Neville. Hall, a former ski-racing champion, was found guilty of negligent homicide in the first criminal prosecution of a reckless skier in the US. With litigation now a regular feature in skiing, Cobb's family reached a $300,000 settlement with the Vail resort. Denver lawyer Jim Chalat, a leading litigator of the skiing industry in Colorado, says the state averages 10m skier visits a year from which 20,000 accidents occur, of which \"only about 1% have a claim\". In 1995, Chalat acted on behalf of a five-year-old girl, Nicole Handley, who had her femur broken by an out-of-control skier, and won an award of $2.4m for a ballerina whose career was ended in a collision with another skier. Chalat's firm also acted in the action against Hall.</p> <p>With so much apparent risk, non-skiers could be forgiven for wondering why Princess Caroline or anybody else bothers. The US National Ski Areas Association, concerned by the heavy media coverage given to Hall's conviction, reassured potential clients that the sport was safer than its recent image suggested, pointing out that last year 30 people died skiing and snowboarding in the US, out of 10m participants. Even Christi Neville was moved to say after her fiance's death: \"Five minutes before the accident, he turned to me and said: 'This has been the best day.' I just never dreamed this could happen skiing.\"</p> <p>But if accidents are rare, the culture of safety around skiing is constantly evolving, even if attitudes on either side of the Atlantic are radically different. In America, skiers will be told to slow down by the ski patrol or face having their passes confiscated. Alcohol, so much a part of the European scene, is not tolerated and in some resorts skiers are breathalysed. Skiing behaviour is regulated by legislation, bringing the courts into how a sport is conducted. Many European skiers feel such restraints take some of the fun out of the sport, but where do you draw the line? Skiing is not getting more dangerous, but technological advances such as Fat Boys and Free Ride skis allow easier turns and faster speeds - so inexperienced skiers are moving on to difficult off-piste terrain that used to be the preserve of the experts. The Ski Club of Great Britain produces a booklet on skiing safely with the new technology but is reluctant to see skiers' freedoms curtailed.</p> <p>\"Skiers should understand what's involved,\" says spokeswoman Vanessa Haines. \"The element of danger is there but that's part of the sport. Skiers should build up experience slowly and understand what causes avalanches. A lot of it is common sense. But hundreds of thousands of Britons go skiing each year and never get hurt and never see an avalanche.\"</p> <p>Haines points to a growing trend at European resorts for American-style controls, like slow skiing areas, incentives for skiers - especially children - to wear helmets and sanctions against reckless skiers. But Gavin Foster, who runs the ski tour company Ski Weekend, warns against following the American model too closely. \"There's already a problem with people who ski with guides that they think they are removing any risk. But guides aren't infallible and we shouldn't expect them to be.\"</p> <p>Foster, who meets skiers ranging from the outstanding to the unfit weekend warrior, believes individuals should be responsible for making sure they are in control on the slopes. \"It's a common problem with British skiers that they stay on the intermediate plateau for too long. It's not so much speed that is dangerous, as not being in control. Skiers often need more instruction than they think.\"</p> <p>Nor is he impressed by the ski snobs who see snowboarders as \"piste-louts\" who shouldn't be allowed on the mountain. \"It's very dangerous to discriminate. Although it's true that the learning curve for boarders is a lot steeper, and that boarders are perhaps not getting as much instruction, these issues are being addressed.\"</p> <p>Boarders have been portrayed in the press as the bad boys of the skiing industry, arrivistes who have muscled their way into the action. With a patois incomprehensible to most traditional skiers and a much younger demographic, even their clothes are looser. Snowboarders were outraged by a suggestion in the press that a cigarette flicked away by a boarder started the fire that swept through the funicular at the Austrian resort of Kaprun killing 159 people. According to Carl Doherty, deputy editor of Snowboard UK, snowboarders' mixed reputation is undeserved. \"It's a bad media perception,\" he says. \"We regularly carry articles on safety and are constantly pointing out that this is a dangerous sport. The snowboarder was portrayed as being ugly and baggy, but he's still there and he's not going away.\" Haines sympathises with the boarders. \"With Free Ride skis, the style and terrain of boarding and skiing have a lot more in common.\"</p> <p>Snowboarding started as a grassroots sport in the 80s, growing partly out of the skateboarding craze, and partly out of frustration with a staid skiing scene. Steve Bailey, at 26 a veteran boarder with British titles dating back to 1993 and the current British Big Air champion, says the antagonism between boarders and skiers is \"a total myth\".</p> <p>Bailey says snowboarding has rescued skiing from its conservative image. \"Skiing had gone through a real dead patch; it was too set in its ways. But now it's all gone towards boarding - the style, the clothes.\" Bailey himself has a contract with boarding fashion gurus Helly Hansen. \"Loads of boarders have switched back to skiing,\" he says. \"Two years ago there was no such thing as a twin-tip ski. Now skiers can do the tricks that boarders have been doing for years. We need to get skiing back buzzing.\"</p> <p>Born in Manchester, and one of the first 50 boarders in the country, Bailey's can-do attitude is a long way from the posh atmosphere of Zuers, but he rejects the accusation that boarders are piste-louts who are spoiling the mountains. \"Of course,\" he says, \"there are wankers in any sport. But I'm into anyone who's into the mountains. I've got loads of friends who are skiers.\"</p> <p>And while skiers may fear the threat of a piste-lout hurtling out of the mist towards them, they are as much at risk from simply being in the mountains.

The industrialisation of the mountains, it seems, holds the biggest risks of all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even the \u00fcber-elite of European aristocracy can have their holidays spoiled. Princess Caroline of Monaco was flown to hospital this week for emergency keyhole surgery on her knee after being flattened on the ski slopes of the exclusive Austrian resort of Zuers by a man one local resident described as a \"piste-lout\". Her husband, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, flew the 32 miles to a private clinic with his wife. Prince Ernst, who last summer was photographed urinating against the Turkish pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hanover and later called a journalist interviewing him about it a \"fat arse\", returned with the couple's daughter Alexandra to the five-star Loruenser Hotel where the family were staying. There is something overwhelming about the recipe of wealth, skiing and cold, crisp mountain air - with a dash of risk thrown in. James Bond never infiltrated himself into a corporate box at Old Trafford, but would find any excuse to whiz down a mountainside on planks with a range of villains shooting from the hip as they slalomed after him. Hence the rush of punters in the 70s to sign up on package ski holidays to Bulgaria for a taste of that exoticism. But Princess Caroline was in some ways very lucky. The list of celebrities who have met an untimely end while skiing includes Michael Kennedy, killed on New Year's Eve 1997 when he collided with a tree in Aspen, and the singer turned Republican politician Sonny Bono, who did something very similar six days later. Even our own royalty is not immune, with Prince Charles narrowly escaping death in an avalanche at Klosters that swept away his bodyguard, Major Hugh Lindsay. And while the celebrities get the biggest headlines, the death toll on the general public is equally remorseless. Earlier this month, Nathan Hall, a 22-year-old former lift operator at Vail in Colorado, was sentenced to 90 days in jail for a fatal collision in 1997 with British-born Alan Cobb, 33, who had been skiing with his fiancee Christi Neville. Hall, a former ski-racing champion, was found guilty of negligent homicide in the first criminal prosecution of a reckless skier in the US. With litigation now a regular feature in skiing, Cobb's family reached a $300,000 settlement with the Vail resort. Denver lawyer Jim Chalat, a leading litigator of the skiing industry in Colorado, says the state averages 10m skier visits a year from which 20,000 accidents occur, of which \"only about 1% have a claim\". In 1995, Chalat acted on behalf of a five-year-old girl, Nicole Handley, who had her femur broken by an out-of-control skier, and won an award of $2.4m for a ballerina whose career was ended in a collision with another skier. Chalat's firm also acted in the action against Hall. With so much apparent risk, non-skiers could be forgiven for wondering why Princess Caroline or anybody else bothers.

      "body": "<p>The painter Ken Kiff, who has died aged 65, never quite starred on the media's British art stage, but his work has many admirers. To them he was a true painter, ever fresh yet firmly rooted in the best traditions. His work has been shown often, from 1970 onwards in thematic and group shows, and, beginning in 1979, also in solo exhibitions, in London, New York and elsewhere.</p> <p>In 1992-93, he was the National Gallery's associate artist. As a teacher, there was no mistaking the way he cared for art, and his deep under standing of it. Occasionally, he gave public lectures - thoughtful, unhurried personal comments on his own art and the art of those he especially valued.</p> <p>Many of us thought of him as an art guru, a very wise man opening up important issues. The abstract painter John McLean introduced us in 1969. At the time, I was writing mostly about abstract art, puzzled by English resistance to it, and eager to draw attention to a remarkable upsurge of outstanding work, especially among English artists. Ken's was wholly and insistently figurative. It was also full of colour, sonorous, sometimes delicate, sometimes tough, but never crude. It was always, in that sense, musical, and indeed he had wide knowledge of classical music of all periods.</p> <p>His subject-matter struck one as openly poetical - a woman, water, a tree and rocks, a little heap of clothing; a lizard, sand, a small rock, a large geometrical sun-moon of the painter's inventing - with more than a hint of myths and legends. He spoke of poetry out of a deep personal attachment to, among others, Yeats, Frost, Wallace Stevens and Emily Dickinson. His pictures took some of their resonance from these attachments, and can be utterly enchanting. They can also be deeply disturbing.</p> <p>When Ken spoke about art, it was about about the aspects people call formalist, those that condition our reading of images. Colour mattered to him especially. The exhibition which ended his time at the National Gallery, a museum dominated by relatively low-toned work, sang with colour. Many of the exhibits were personal reworkings of the gallery's pictures of the 13th and 14th centuries, before elaborate tonal modelling and sfumato [the gradual transition between colours] made colour secondary and ornamental, not an essential structural as well as expressive element.</p> <p>Also important were the character and disposition of forms, the spaces between them, their firm or broken outlines, the dynamics of rising or sinking forms. These were aspects he was eager to talk about, in his own art or others', from Chinese landscapists to the old masters and moderns, notably Picasso, Matisse, Klee, Mir\u00f3 and Pollock. He had a special passion for Chagall, finding in him a venturing, partly playful spirit akin to his own, but Klee was the essential precursor, not only for the delicacy and economy of his working methods but also for Klee's guiding principle, the genetic process by which images arise out of the marks made and the materials being used.</p> <p>Not that Ken's work ever looks like Klee's, or Chagall's, or anyone else's. Often his images are benign and cheerful, but at times they were grim, even ghastly. Generally his work was dream-like, neither a description of reality nor accounts of dreams and daydreams, but drawing on both as raw materials. He had no doubt that art should be beautiful, but that did not mean pretty or polite. Art lovers have sometimes been offended by the cruel or coarse actions he included, up-front and without apology. More often his compositions, large and small, from commanding triptychs down to enticing little prints and monoprints, involve a little man (himself?), radiantly beautiful women, elements of landscape (trees, hills, caves, rivers, a boat) or of towns (streets, houses, a pillar-box), but also fairy-tale ogres, truncated bodies and floating heads. Everything has the presence of intense imaginings, and lives on the surface of his pictures as being of now, this minute. The life of colour and form concerned him above all else once a painting was started, and many a work changed both as to cast and script. His pictures end up looking spontaneous, off-hand even. He was always reluctant to say a work was finished, needing to reconsider this or that aspect of it. He was also reluctant to talk about its specific meaning, and not keen to have us speculate about it.</p> <p>His origins were simple: he was born in Essex, and his father had worked in a woodyard being killed in the first months of the war. One of his two step-fathers appears in an emblematic portrait - a sad, silent image. He did not speak of his mother; a brother died in 1998 after a grave illness. Ken studied at Hornsey School of Art, pottery first, then stained glass under an inspiring teacher, and thence moved on into painting. He married a fellow artist, Jane, later to become a psycho-therapist, when they were still quite young; their children, Anna and Sam, were tremendously important to him.</p> <p>Many of Ken's pictures suggest journeys or adventures, with himself as protagonist. In 1970, he embarked on a series of small pictures on paper as a parallel activity to his painting on canvas and on boards. He called this project The Sequence. Its nearly 200 numbered pictures relate to himself more openly, in many instances picturing him in various actual and imagined situations, sometimes in an almost illustrational manner, often allegorically. Its essential subject is the harmonies and discords, marvels as well as dismays, occasioned by the interaction of outer reality and the realities of thought and memory. Quentin Blake has included a Kiff in his Tell Me A Picture show at the National Gallery (open until June 17); a selection of Kiff's prints will be at Charleston, near Lewes, from May 13 to June 24.</p> <p>\u0095 Ken Kiff, painter and printmaker, born May 29 1935; died February 15 2001</p>",

      "body": "<p>Psion yesterday broke through the gloom surrounding its share price, at least temporarily, with a deal to supply its Bluetooth technology to NEC Computers. </p> <p>The agreement lifted the handheld computer group's shares by 4.72% to 194.75p. Psion will supply a range of Bluetooth products such as PCs, laptops, mobile phones and handheld computers, which would be able to communicate with each other without using cables. </p> <p>The deal with two divisions of the computer group, NEC Online in the commercial market and Packard Bell for consumers, is unlikely to create significant revenues until next year, but a Psion spokesman said the announcement marked NEC as a Bluetooth player. </p> <p>NEC has about 5% of world laptops sales. The deal follows a similar agreement between Psion and Compaq. </p> <p>\"Volume sales of Bluetooth will really kick in next year,\" the spokesman said. \"It's the network effect. It's like mobile phones - once people around you had one then they started to really take off. We are on our way.\" </p> <p>Psion has some way to go,, before repairing damage to the share price caused by a steady stream of negative news. A profits warning at the end of last year, the collapse of a joint venture with Motorola to develop an \"internet in your pocket\" product and the broad sweep of sentiment against the mobile phone sector have combined to bring the share price down from \u00a315 this time last year. </p> <p>Much of the value attributed to Psion has been from its lead role in Symbian, the venture with leading mobile phone manufacturers to develop the standard operating platform for the next generation of high-speed wireless devices. </p> <p>Bluetooth is being driven by a group including IBM, Microsoft, Motorola and Nokia which are working together to establish an industry standard. </p> <p>The separate venture with Motorola which collapsed last month amounted to Psion's second profits warning in the space of three months. The company claimed it was a victim of internal restructuring at Motorola which had led to the cancellation of a number of projects. </p> <p>The palm-sized gadget being worked on was a cross between a Psion personal organiser, a mobile phone and a unit for accessing the internet at high speed. It was to have been one of Psion's main products launched this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Psion yesterday broke through the gloom surrounding its share price, at least temporarily, with a deal to supply its Bluetooth technology to NEC Computers. The agreement lifted the handheld computer group's shares by 4.72% to 194.75p. Psion will supply a range of Bluetooth products such as PCs, laptops, mobile phones and handheld computers, which would be able to communicate with each other without using cables. The deal with two divisions of the computer group, NEC Online in the commercial market and Packard Bell for consumers, is unlikely to create significant revenues until next year, but a Psion spokesman said the announcement marked NEC as a Bluetooth player. NEC has about 5% of world laptops sales. The deal follows a similar agreement between Psion and Compaq. \"Volume sales of Bluetooth will really kick in next year,\" the spokesman said. \"It's the network effect. It's like mobile phones - once people around you had one then they started to really take off. We are on our way.\" Psion has some way to go,, before repairing damage to the share price caused by a steady stream of negative news. A profits warning at the end of last year, the collapse of a joint venture with Motorola to develop an \"internet in your pocket\" product and the broad sweep of sentiment against the mobile phone sector have combined to bring the share price down from \u00a315 this time last year. Much of the value attributed to Psion has been from its lead role in Symbian, the venture with leading mobile phone manufacturers to develop the standard operating platform for the next generation of high-speed wireless devices. Bluetooth is being driven by a group including IBM, Microsoft, Motorola and Nokia which are working together to establish an industry standard. The separate venture with Motorola which collapsed last month amounted to Psion's second profits warning in the space of three months. The company claimed it was a victim of internal restructuring at Motorola which had led to the cancellation of a number of projects. The palm-sized gadget being worked on was a cross between a Psion personal organiser, a mobile phone and a unit for accessing the internet at high speed. It was to have been one of Psion's main products launched this year.",

The parity act, a brainchild of Sylviane Agacinski, the philosopher wife of the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, became law last summer and seems likely to transform the political life of a notoriously chauvinist state. \"It has already had one dramatic effect,\" said Claire Bernard, a member of the government agency set up to monitor sexual equality in politics and the workplace, the parity observatory. \"There is no more arguing about women's role in politics; the law has simply imposed legitimacy.\" Promised by Mr Jospin in his 1997 election campaign, the law applies to party lists in local, regional, parliamentary and European elections. For the March 11 local council elections it has obliged parties to put up equal numbers of men and women in every district with at least 3,500 inhabitants. On paper that means only 2,800 of the 36,000 communes, but the observatory says they are big enough to ensure that by Easter 40% of local council members should be conseill\u00e8res rather than conseillers - a huge change in the political scene. Whereas 45% of Swedish MPs are women, French women, who got the vote only in 1944, have just 8.7% of the national assembly's 577 seats - the lowest in any EU country and 52nd in the world, behind such countries as Tunisia and Senegal. The bill was opposed by many conservatives and some leading women's rights campaigners, who argued that only sustained grassroots pressure could lead to real change. But many of the tens of thousands of women seeking election for the first time next month argue that the law has changed their lives. Odile Barbat-Blanc, 27 a law student in Aix-en-Provence, volunteered to help the campaign of a mayoral candidate for the centre-right UDF. \"It didn't take him long to ask me to join his list,\" she said. \"My friends and family said 'For heaven's sake steer clear of politics', but so far I'm loving it. \"It's teaching me about life and about myself, but above all I feel I'm being useful, and I'm respected.

Klein, 53, was part of a six-man terrorist unit led by the Venezuelan Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, known as Carlos the Jackal, which attacked the Opec session, shooting dead an Austrian policeman, an Iraqi bodyguard and a Libyan delegate, and taking 70 people hostage. Austria supplied the terrorists with a plane and they flew via Libya to Algeria, where the hostages were set free. Klein, who was shot in the stomach when police stormed the conference centre, went underground after the attack, eventually making his way to France ,where he was captured in 1998 and extradited to Germany. During the trial he admitted being involved in the raid, but denied firing the fatal shots. Summing up, Judge Heinrich Gehrke told Klein, who sat without showing any emotion: \"This was not just some bank robbery but a politically motivated crime.\" The trial, which began four months ago, brought to light the radical pasts of some highly respected politicians, most notably the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer. Mr Fischer, a friend of Klein in their youth in Frankfurt in the 1970s, was called last month as a character witness in the trial. He told the court that he had tried to steer Klein away from violence, but had not managed to prevent him joining the Revolutionary Cells (RZ), an extreme faction through which Klein met Carlos the Jackal. The trial has depicted Klein's life as tragic. Mr Fischer and other witnesses described him as \"a bit of a loser\" who inadvertently fell into the extreme militant scene in a desperate attempt to be accepted by his peers. Klein made the same point, saying of the raid: \"Ten minutes of Opec destroyed my life.\" His co-defendant, Rudolf Schindler, 57, who Klein said had recruited him into the RZ, was acquitted. Mr Fischer's presence at the trial intensified the debate about his radical past. The latest twist came this week, when he admitted that he had spent an hour at a PLO conference in Algeria in 1969, but left because, according to an aide, \"he found it too boring\". He is also fighting allegations that during his days in Frankfurt he and a flatmate, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, now a prominent French Green MEP, harboured the Red Army faction terrorist Margit Schiller. The Frankfurt state prosecutor's office announced on Wednesday that it would start proceedings against Mr Fischer which could lead to perjury charges. Earlier in the trial Mr Fischer denied that Schiller had lived with him. A few days later, however, he revised his statement to say that she might have been in the same building.",

      "bodyText": "The UN emergency relief coordinator, Kenzo Oshima, visited overcrowded refugee camps around the western Afghan city of Herat yesterday, where cold and hunger are already claiming lives, and warned that a major catastrophe could develop unless something was done to relieve the worsening problem. Mr Oshima, appointed UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs a month ago, added: \"It is clear that no amount of international assistance is going to be enough.\" Mr Oshima is having talks with representatives of the Taliban regime, and has met the deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who is still recognised by the UN as Afghan head of state. Throughout Afghanistan drought and the currently intensifying civil war have forced more than 500,000 people to flee their homes in the past year, sell their few belongings and travel to makeshift camps, where they depend for survival on a slow trickle of foreign aid. Every day adds another 360 to the 80,000 living in tents and mud huts in the six camps around Herat. In Maslakh camp, the only site with space left, most tents hold two families. At night the temperature falls as low as -25C (-13F). More than 170 people, 130 of them children, have died in Herat in the past month. Although the snow is melting 20 refugees die every week from hunger and exposure. Soon after a particularly cold spell brought the first deaths, the US and Norway airlifted blankets and tents directly to Herat.

There is growing concern about the thousands still in remote areas of the nearby Badghis, Ghowr and Faryab provinces. Mr Donini estimated that 500,000 people, difficult to reach, remained severely affected in their home areas.

At least these people who are staying behind have the chance to work together to find the resources to plant a crop.\" Unlike their previous experience of drought, the refugees have no money, no crops to plant and little incentive to return home, aid workers say. To compound the problem, heavy fighting between the Taliban, who control most of the country, and opposition forces has continued throughout the winter. The opposition won its biggest victory since 1997 on Tuesday, when it retook Bamiyan, a key city 80 miles west of Kabul. Many western governments appear reluctant to fund long-term projects in Afghanistan while the Taliban are in charge. In recent years the UN has received less than half the money needed for its Afghan aid programme. Hans-Christian Poulsen, who runs the UN relief operation in Herat, said: \"[Disaster] has been coming for some time.

      "body": "<p>The mood is bleak in the former coalmining town of Artyom, whose residents are beginning to wonder if they have been condemned to die a slow, freezing death. Russia's far east is experiencing its bitterest winter for 70 years and the region's heating system is in collapse. Since the cold set in, the shuddering energy network has left 86,000 people battling to survive in unlit, unheated flats, as temperatures outside drop as low as minus 60 degrees.</p> <p>Some people have been stranded without heat and electricity for just a few days. Others - such as thousands in Artyom, an hour from Vladivostok - have been living in Arctic conditions since the first frosts arrived last October.</p> <p>The political fallout from the crisis is rippling across Russia as accusing fingers are pointed in every direction. The governor of the far eastern region Primorye, the tyrannical Yevgeny Nazdratenko, sought refuge in hospital claiming heart pains on the day he was meant to explain the disaster to a presidential commission. Last week he was forced to resign by an angry Vladimir Putin, the president; Alexander Gavrin, the energy minister, was also fired.</p> <p>But these dismissals have not brought heat to the region. The collapse within Russia's decrepit infrastructure is so extreme that personnel changes have only marginal impact. At the root of the crisis is a tangle of problems, with incompetence and corruption among senior politicians knotted up so inextricably with poverty and mismanagement at a local level that the Kremlin will need to devote years to unravelling the mess.</p> <p>Meanwhile Viktoria Garazhenko's family of five remain squeezed in one room, their beds lined up like a cramped hospital ward. Two metal heaters give out faint waves of warmth - when the electricity is working - but are too weak to banish the overpowering cold. The children stamp about in fur boots, their bodies wrapped inside padded dressing gowns and heavy layers of clothes. At night they lay their coats on top of the blankets and tie scarves around their heads; despite these precautions two are recovering from bronchitis.</p> <p>A 2cm-thick crust of ice covers the inner window panes in the rest of the flat; only a thin blue echo of daylight glimmers through the frost. Chicken legs stored on a shelf in the kitchen stay frozen. Long, dagger-sharp icicles trail down from the corrugated roof outside.</p> <p>\"It's not just that we're cold,\" said Mrs Garazhenko, a teacher at one of Artyom's secondary schools, her words forming delicate clouds of condensation. \"We haven't had any water since the pipes burst. The toilet froze and broke several months ago and then the electricity began to black out. These are inhuman conditions.\"</p> <p>Two young girls trying to keep warm in an unheated flat in Artyom recently died in their sleep when their electric blanket short-circuited. Officially no casualties have been registered, but deaths of dozens from the cold and from fires caused by faulty heating equipment have been unofficially linked to the crisis.</p> <p>In the nearby village of Razdolnoye, apartment blocks remain unheated. Lyubov Krasilnikova, a night caretaker at one of the local army bases, has taken to cooking soup on an electric stove balanced on her bedside table to keep the room at a bearable temperature. When the electricity cuts came, there were no candles to be had in the shop; the family sat in the dark.</p> <p>A vicious circle of disaster has triggered her problems. Unusually extreme temperatures meant heating pipes burst; shortages of fuel meant power stations could not cope when people began turning on their electric heaters. Power cuts began and the temperatures dropped lower. But as the crisis stretches into its fourth month, Mrs Krasilnikova has begun searching for an individual to blame, settling finally for Nikolai Yudin, director of the nearby brick-making factory.</p> <p>Under a Soviet era-designed scheme, Mr Yudin is paid by the local government to heat village apartment blocks using steam from the factory to provide virtually free constant heating for the entire winter. Rusting pipes run overground from the plant for a mile, to reach the radiators in the flats. The water is much cooler by the time it arrives (bits of cladding have been stolen for scrap metal) but usually the system works. In January, when temperatures were plunging to -50c, his boiler broke down and 2,000 people were left to freeze. By the time the system was mended, the pipes and radiators had already frozen and the thick metal had cracked open; the heating network was ruined.</p> <p>Sitting beneath a yellowing portrait of Lenin in his director's office, muffled in his coat and fur hat, Mr Yudin lays the blame elsewhere. Every year the local administration is meant to deliver 6,000 tonnes of coal to fuel the heating process; this year only 123 tonnes arrived. Desperate telegrams were sent to the local mayor, Alexander Prokhurov, but no response arrived.

      "bodyText": "The mood is bleak in the former coalmining town of Artyom, whose residents are beginning to wonder if they have been condemned to die a slow, freezing death. Russia's far east is experiencing its bitterest winter for 70 years and the region's heating system is in collapse. Since the cold set in, the shuddering energy network has left 86,000 people battling to survive in unlit, unheated flats, as temperatures outside drop as low as minus 60 degrees. Some people have been stranded without heat and electricity for just a few days. Others - such as thousands in Artyom, an hour from Vladivostok - have been living in Arctic conditions since the first frosts arrived last October. The political fallout from the crisis is rippling across Russia as accusing fingers are pointed in every direction. The governor of the far eastern region Primorye, the tyrannical Yevgeny Nazdratenko, sought refuge in hospital claiming heart pains on the day he was meant to explain the disaster to a presidential commission. Last week he was forced to resign by an angry Vladimir Putin, the president; Alexander Gavrin, the energy minister, was also fired. But these dismissals have not brought heat to the region. The collapse within Russia's decrepit infrastructure is so extreme that personnel changes have only marginal impact. At the root of the crisis is a tangle of problems, with incompetence and corruption among senior politicians knotted up so inextricably with poverty and mismanagement at a local level that the Kremlin will need to devote years to unravelling the mess. Meanwhile Viktoria Garazhenko's family of five remain squeezed in one room, their beds lined up like a cramped hospital ward. Two metal heaters give out faint waves of warmth - when the electricity is working - but are too weak to banish the overpowering cold. The children stamp about in fur boots, their bodies wrapped inside padded dressing gowns and heavy layers of clothes. At night they lay their coats on top of the blankets and tie scarves around their heads; despite these precautions two are recovering from bronchitis. A 2cm-thick crust of ice covers the inner window panes in the rest of the flat; only a thin blue echo of daylight glimmers through the frost. Chicken legs stored on a shelf in the kitchen stay frozen. Long, dagger-sharp icicles trail down from the corrugated roof outside. \"It's not just that we're cold,\" said Mrs Garazhenko, a teacher at one of Artyom's secondary schools, her words forming delicate clouds of condensation. \"We haven't had any water since the pipes burst. The toilet froze and broke several months ago and then the electricity began to black out. These are inhuman conditions.\" Two young girls trying to keep warm in an unheated flat in Artyom recently died in their sleep when their electric blanket short-circuited. Officially no casualties have been registered, but deaths of dozens from the cold and from fires caused by faulty heating equipment have been unofficially linked to the crisis. In the nearby village of Razdolnoye, apartment blocks remain unheated. Lyubov Krasilnikova, a night caretaker at one of the local army bases, has taken to cooking soup on an electric stove balanced on her bedside table to keep the room at a bearable temperature. When the electricity cuts came, there were no candles to be had in the shop; the family sat in the dark. A vicious circle of disaster has triggered her problems. Unusually extreme temperatures meant heating pipes burst; shortages of fuel meant power stations could not cope when people began turning on their electric heaters. Power cuts began and the temperatures dropped lower. But as the crisis stretches into its fourth month, Mrs Krasilnikova has begun searching for an individual to blame, settling finally for Nikolai Yudin, director of the nearby brick-making factory. Under a Soviet era-designed scheme, Mr Yudin is paid by the local government to heat village apartment blocks using steam from the factory to provide virtually free constant heating for the entire winter. Rusting pipes run overground from the plant for a mile, to reach the radiators in the flats. The water is much cooler by the time it arrives (bits of cladding have been stolen for scrap metal) but usually the system works. In January, when temperatures were plunging to -50c, his boiler broke down and 2,000 people were left to freeze. By the time the system was mended, the pipes and radiators had already frozen and the thick metal had cracked open; the heating network was ruined. Sitting beneath a yellowing portrait of Lenin in his director's office, muffled in his coat and fur hat, Mr Yudin lays the blame elsewhere. Every year the local administration is meant to deliver 6,000 tonnes of coal to fuel the heating process; this year only 123 tonnes arrived. Desperate telegrams were sent to the local mayor, Alexander Prokhurov, but no response arrived. The boiler stopped working when they resorted to low-grade coal. \"I spent factory money on buying more coal, because I felt sorry for the people who were beginning to freeze. We had to stop producing bricks to conserve coal for heating,\" Mr Yudin said angrily. The factory has been officially bankrupt for years, largely because of unpaid regional heating debts. \"Despite all the promises, we've only got enough fuel now to last for four more days, and then more homes will be cut off.\" In the draughty mayor's office, Mr Prokhurov wearily accuses those further up the food chain. \"There isn't enough fuel and no one has done any repairs on the heating system for 40 years. What can you expect?\" he said. On the roads outside his window, men can be seen dragging felled trees back to their yards, to be burnt in the home-made metal stoves that many have installed over the winter. The buck-passing continues inside the Vladivostok White House, the head of the regional administration, where two major culprits are identified by those officials still loyal to Mr Nazdratenko: the International Monetary Fund and Russia's electricity monopoly UES. The IMF is blamed for helping close a dozen coal mines as part of a restructuring programme in 1996, leaving Primorye with just one pit. Artyom, one of the worst hit regions, is the site of seven abandoned mines. Half the coal burnt by the region is brought by train 4,000 miles from central Siberia.

      "bodyText": "This week I spoke at one of those dinner clubs that seem rather popular these days. You don't get paid or anything, but you have a nice meal in amiable company. Before we sat down to the soup, someone asked me how I could bear to write about politics day in, day out, when it was such a boring subject. But it isn't boring. Obviously many of the policies are, and so are most of the speeches. But the drama, the human interest, the sheer operatic soapiness of the whole thing! Take industry questions yesterday. There was enough character development spread out in front of us to keep the new Crossroads going for months. For example, Patricia Hewitt (junior manager of the motel), seems to be playing minister for renewable energy. She was asked by the Labour MP David Kidney (\"Oooh, you are offal, but I like you!\") whether her department would invest in what appears to be inventing a perpetual motion machine. Ms Hewitt has a precise, sympathetic and caring voice. She sounds as if she is addressing a class of very sweet but backward children. When MPs ask her supplementary questions, she smiles at them encouragingly and nods her head brightly. She would have been perfect 30 years ago on Blue Peter. \"Our aim is for 10% of all energy to come from renewable sources within the next 10 years,\" she fluted. \"So you'll need two empty yoghurt pots, some sticky-backed plastic, and an elastic band. Don't forget to ask mummy and daddy first!\" (Obviously I made the last bit up, but my point is that nobody would have been remotely surprised if she had said it.) Or take Peter Hain. Until a few weeks ago, when the government was reshuffled, Mr Hain was the Foreign Office minister in charge of half the globe. The Middle East, Africa, the United Nations .. He bestrode the globe, if not like a colossus, at least like someone rather taller than his boss. Now, he is in charge of breathing difficulties. Former miners are complaining that they can't get compensation for their ailments. Within two weeks, Mr Hain has become an expert. Where once murmuring civil servants placed briefs about President Mbeki, and the election prospects of Mr Sharon, now they tell him of \"domiciliary cases\" and \"identified causes of asthma\". Last month he would have been appealing for calm in a difficult and potentially explosive situation. Now he is assuring MPs that \"doctors prefer to see respiratory cases in person, so they can make a better judgment\". Or then there's Denis MacShane, the MP for Rotherham. He is the Benny of the new soap opera, because however well he starts, he always makes an idiot of himself by the end. Yesterday he was complaining about the industry department's failure to bring down electricity prices. So far, so good. Then he raved: \"Put the officials into electric chairs, then if in 10 days' time they can't delivered electricity prices the same as on the continent, let me push the button!\" Duh! Finally there is Stephen Byers, a gentle soul who simply doesn't understand the wicked ways of industry. Mass redundancies, the heist of government subsidies, predatory practices - all these come as a terrible surprise. Some politicians resemble bulls in china shops: one thinks of John Prescott or Ann Widdecombe.

      "bodyText": "Two tabloid newspaper stories claiming that one of James Bulger's killers had attacked other inmates in his secure unit were in one case a fabrication and in the other blown up out of proportion, the high court heard yesterday. The articles in the Sunday People were presented as evidence supporting a legal move by the murdered child's father to block the release of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. One story claimed that Thompson had come to blows with another boy, while another said that he had attempted to strangle a fellow inmate with a flex. But counsel for the home secretary said one of the stories had been invented - and a faked official report reproduced in the newspaper - while in the row that led to the \"strangling\" it was the other boy who was the protagonist. Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, recommended in October that Thompson and Venables should be eligible for release this August, when they will be 19, and said neither boy had shown \"any aggression or propensity for violence during his period of detention\". Alan Newman QC, appearing for James's father Ralph, said yesterday that Lord Woolf would never have used those words if the Home Office had told him about the two attacks Thompson had allegedly perpetrated in 1997 and 1999. Both were published on the front page of the Sunday People after the judge made his decision. Mr Newman told the high court that official local authority reports had documented the first attack. \"There was a fight which occurred between Thompson and a fellow detainee, John Howells - each of whom was boasting about who had committed the most evil crime. Howells had apparently battered his mother to death with a hammer. \"Each person was the subject of a separate report.

The situation was quickly confronted and both received medical attention and were sanctioned [punished]. Thompson suffered a graze to his knee and a bruise to his left cheek. Howells suffered a scratch to his right eye and a graze to his chest.'\" However, David Pannick QC, counsel for Jack Straw, the home secretary, said the fight \"simply did not occur\" and that Thompson, then 14, and Howells, then 16, had in fact been friendly. A prison service official who investigated the claims found that the two boys had formed \"a positive, supportive relationship\" and that on the day the newspaper report was published Howells contacted the unit and said he had been \"deeply upset\" by the story. Mr Pannick said: \"This alleged incident is a complete fabrication. Someone has obtained a blank form which they have filled in and they have supplied it to the Sunday People.

      "body": "<p>A \u00a33bn NHS hospital building programme announced yesterday will include 26 \"fast-track\" centres to speed up the treatment of non-urgent patients who often have their appointments cancelled.</p> <p>Health secretary Alan Milburn said 29 building projects, worth \u00a33.1bn, had been approved by his department. There will be an 11% increase in funding for training NHS staff, to alleviate the shortage of doctors, nurses and other professionals.</p> <p>Every region in the country would be required to increase hospital beds to end the misery of patients being shipped to hospitals miles from home because of bed shortages.</p> <p>\"This is an unprecedented expansion in new hospital developments in the NHS,\" Mr Milburn told the House of Commons. \"For millions of patients and thousands of staff it will provide modern state-of-the-art hospital treatment and care.\" The Department of Health was preparing to allow 18 schemes, but is approving all 29 recommended by its expert advisers.</p> <p>The hospital projects will be built under the public finance initiative, with an option for the NHS to resume ownership at the end of the contract.</p> <p>Work will begin this year on the first 12, in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol's mental health services, Central Middlesex, East Kent, Leicester, Lewisham, Peterborough, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Wakefield and Whipps Cross in London.</p> <p>\"You cannot deliver 21st century care in 19th century buildings,\" Mr Milburn said. \"For too long investment in NHS infrastructure has been a low priority when it should have been a high priority.</p> <p>\"The consequences are plain for all to see: buildings that are shoddy, equipment that is unreliable, hospitals that are out of date. In too many places the environment where staff work and patients receive care is simply unacceptable.\"</p> <p>Sixteen of the new hospitals will have the fast-track centres, which will treat only patients who need routine operations such as hip replacements. In most hospitals, planned surgery is always at risk of being cancelled to make way for emergencies. Ten other fast-track facilities will be built at existing hospitals.</p> <p>\"Patients will be able to book their admissions at their convenience rather than simply being given an appointment date,\" said Mr Milburn.</p> <p>\"Some will operate at weekends. Crucially they will mean greater reliability for patients by helping to end the misery of last-minute cancelled operations.\"</p> <p>There are serious shortages of doctors and, particularly, nurses in the NHS, but Mr Milburn claimed that numbers have already risen in response to recruitment campaigns and new training places.</p> <p>Between September 1999 and September 2000, there were 2,500 more doctors, 3,500 more scientists, therapists and technicians and over 6,300 more nurses in the NHS. The new money is intended to keep staff numbers increasing until 2010. The bed-cutting which has been a feature of the NHS for four decades is at an end, Mr Milburn said.</p> <p>He told the Commons that 157,000 were cut between 1980 and 1997 alone. Every new hospital will have more beds than the one it replaces - 3,000 more in all.</p> <p>Peter Hawker, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said the big rise in beds was \"excellent news provided the NHS is successful in recruiting the nurses and doctors required to staff them\".</p> <p><b>The winners</b></p> <p>Birmingham</p> <p>Bradford</p> <p>Bristol mental health and acute services</p> <p>Central Middlesex</p> <p>East Kent</p> <p>Leicester</p> <p>Lewisham</p> <p>Peterborough</p> <p>Salford</p> <p>Tunbridge Wells</p> <p>Wakefield</p> <p>Whipps Cross</p> <p>Chase Farm (London)</p> <p>Brighton</p> <p>Central Nottinghamshire</p> <p>Chelmsford</p> <p>Colchester</p> <p>Hull</p> <p>North Middlesex</p> <p>North Staffs</p> <p>Plymouth</p> <p>St Helen's</p> <p>Walsall</p> <p>Wolverhampton</p> <p>Oxford</p> <p>Southampton</p> <p>South Devon</p> <p>Tameside</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a33bn NHS hospital building programme announced yesterday will include 26 \"fast-track\" centres to speed up the treatment of non-urgent patients who often have their appointments cancelled. Health secretary Alan Milburn said 29 building projects, worth \u00a33.1bn, had been approved by his department. There will be an 11% increase in funding for training NHS staff, to alleviate the shortage of doctors, nurses and other professionals. Every region in the country would be required to increase hospital beds to end the misery of patients being shipped to hospitals miles from home because of bed shortages. \"This is an unprecedented expansion in new hospital developments in the NHS,\" Mr Milburn told the House of Commons. \"For millions of patients and thousands of staff it will provide modern state-of-the-art hospital treatment and care.\" The Department of Health was preparing to allow 18 schemes, but is approving all 29 recommended by its expert advisers. The hospital projects will be built under the public finance initiative, with an option for the NHS to resume ownership at the end of the contract. Work will begin this year on the first 12, in Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol's mental health services, Central Middlesex, East Kent, Leicester, Lewisham, Peterborough, Salford, Tunbridge Wells, Wakefield and Whipps Cross in London. \"You cannot deliver 21st century care in 19th century buildings,\" Mr Milburn said. \"For too long investment in NHS infrastructure has been a low priority when it should have been a high priority. \"The consequences are plain for all to see: buildings that are shoddy, equipment that is unreliable, hospitals that are out of date. In too many places the environment where staff work and patients receive care is simply unacceptable.\" Sixteen of the new hospitals will have the fast-track centres, which will treat only patients who need routine operations such as hip replacements. In most hospitals, planned surgery is always at risk of being cancelled to make way for emergencies. Ten other fast-track facilities will be built at existing hospitals. \"Patients will be able to book their admissions at their convenience rather than simply being given an appointment date,\" said Mr Milburn. \"Some will operate at weekends. Crucially they will mean greater reliability for patients by helping to end the misery of last-minute cancelled operations.\" There are serious shortages of doctors and, particularly, nurses in the NHS, but Mr Milburn claimed that numbers have already risen in response to recruitment campaigns and new training places. Between September 1999 and September 2000, there were 2,500 more doctors, 3,500 more scientists, therapists and technicians and over 6,300 more nurses in the NHS. The new money is intended to keep staff numbers increasing until 2010. The bed-cutting which has been a feature of the NHS for four decades is at an end, Mr Milburn said. He told the Commons that 157,000 were cut between 1980 and 1997 alone. Every new hospital will have more beds than the one it replaces - 3,000 more in all. Peter Hawker, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said the big rise in beds was \"excellent news provided the NHS is successful in recruiting the nurses and doctors required to staff them\".

Mr Cooper, a father of two, made a claim saying he became moody and depressed after the accident in which he had first believed that he had killed Sarah Sykes, four. The child made a full recovery, but Mr Cooper suffered from acute sickness, anger and flashbacks following the accident, the court was told. He also dreamed about accidents involving his own children and became acutely anxious about their safety. Mr Cooper claimed that because of his condition he was unable to run his business, which went on to collapse, and his wife left with their children because of his behaviour. Post-traumatic stress disorder led to the \"disintegration\" of every aspect of his life, the court was told. Lord Justice Brooke said there was expert evidence that Mr Cooper was still suffering severe psychological symptoms - including depression and preoccupation with the accident - two years after it had happened. The minicab driver and her employers challenged Mr Cooper's claim, saying he had been working as a bouncer at a country club in Epping Forest after the accident and had been charged with affray and spraying CS gas with intent after chasing a carload of club customers who had caused trouble.",

Ms Wade said: \"We are very hopeful, but there is a danger that the changes may not be as wholehearted as we would have liked to see.\" Ms Cooper is regarded as one of the brightest stars in the government who is favoured by both the Blair and Brown camps. A former journalist, she was appointed to the frontline post of public health minister in 1999, two years after her election to parliament.",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 There does seem to be a curse attached to the annual Retail Week conference. Last year - you may recall - there was sensation when Jim Hodkinson, the chief executive of New Look clothing chain, was given a \u00a3600,000 payoff on being sacked after (allegedly) sexually harassing a female employee at the conference's awards night disco. The bad luck has rubbed off on this year's \"outstanding panel of speakers\" (according to the blurb). Day two promises a talk on \"Ecological and environmental issues of modern retailing\", by Susan Falk, billed as the president of Body Shop International. Sadly, Ms Falk resigned from her position (responsible for products and marketing) back in January after only nine months. The curse extends to Alan McWalter,marketing director at M&amp;S, who is speaking on \"Using your brand to deliver success\". Mr McWalter's masterstroke at rebranding M&amp;S using the \"size 16\" ad (remember? a naked woman shouting \"I am normal\" on a hilltop) delivered so much success that shoppers went elsewhere. </p> <p>\u0095 Speaking of curses, Richard Branson seems to be under one. First it was the National Lottery, then the east coast rail franchise, and now it's a \u00a36,000 bet with Nicola Horlick. In March 1998, Branson bet Horlick (famous for her one-woman siege of Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt after being sacked) that her Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Asset Management UK growth fund would not be able to outperform the Footsie all-share index by 2% for three years running. With just a month remaining until the wager's end, SGAM's fund is up 29% while the FTSE All Share has gained 14.5%, according to number-crunchers at Money Marketing magazine. Virgin Direct's tracker fund lags at 11.1%. </p> <p>\u0095 Clients hoping to get any sense out of Deutsche Bank's London office today won't have much luck: the annual bonuses were announced yesterday and such was the size of the company's largesse that the celebrations will have meant sore heads from the booze and sore fingers from counting their money. </p> <p>\u0095 Some hopeful news for those (such as Bank of England hard man Mervyn King) who did not get presents on Valentine's Day: perhaps your lover ordered them from <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>. In which case they might still be on the way. Chris Greene ordered a tasteful Valentine's gift (a pink helium balloon with I Love You on it, very classy) from the dot.com on February 8, and was puzzled when his girlfriend didn't get it on Wednesday. On telephoning Lastminute to inquire, he was told: \"Oh yes, we did have some delivery problems.\" A refund was eventually offered, but only after Chris had to point out the significance of the date. </p> <p>\u0095 A strange notice has appeared in the corridors of the Treasury.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 There does seem to be a curse attached to the annual Retail Week conference. Last year - you may recall - there was sensation when Jim Hodkinson, the chief executive of New Look clothing chain, was given a \u00a3600,000 payoff on being sacked after (allegedly) sexually harassing a female employee at the conference's awards night disco. The bad luck has rubbed off on this year's \"outstanding panel of speakers\" (according to the blurb). Day two promises a talk on \"Ecological and environmental issues of modern retailing\", by Susan Falk, billed as the president of Body Shop International. Sadly, Ms Falk resigned from her position (responsible for products and marketing) back in January after only nine months. The curse extends to Alan McWalter,marketing director at M&amp;S, who is speaking on \"Using your brand to deliver success\". Mr McWalter's masterstroke at rebranding M&amp;S using the \"size 16\" ad (remember? a naked woman shouting \"I am normal\" on a hilltop) delivered so much success that shoppers went elsewhere. \u0095 Speaking of curses, Richard Branson seems to be under one. First it was the National Lottery, then the east coast rail franchise, and now it's a \u00a36,000 bet with Nicola Horlick. In March 1998, Branson bet Horlick (famous for her one-woman siege of Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt after being sacked) that her Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Asset Management UK growth fund would not be able to outperform the Footsie all-share index by 2% for three years running. With just a month remaining until the wager's end, SGAM's fund is up 29% while the FTSE All Share has gained 14.5%, according to number-crunchers at Money Marketing magazine. Virgin Direct's tracker fund lags at 11.1%. \u0095 Clients hoping to get any sense out of Deutsche Bank's London office today won't have much luck: the annual bonuses were announced yesterday and such was the size of the company's largesse that the celebrations will have meant sore heads from the booze and sore fingers from counting their money. \u0095 Some hopeful news for those (such as Bank of England hard man Mervyn King) who did not get presents on Valentine's Day: perhaps your lover ordered them from Lastminute.com. In which case they might still be on the way. Chris Greene ordered a tasteful Valentine's gift (a pink helium balloon with I Love You on it, very classy) from the dot.com on February 8, and was puzzled when his girlfriend didn't get it on Wednesday. On telephoning Lastminute to inquire, he was told: \"Oh yes, we did have some delivery problems.\" A refund was eventually offered, but only after Chris had to point out the significance of the date. \u0095 A strange notice has appeared in the corridors of the Treasury. Calling for \"Budget buddies\" (staff who accompany embargoed copies of the Budget to various places, including the media), the notice offers the following incentives: \"You can meet a famous correspondent and ride in a chauffeur-driven car.\" Whee.

      "body": "<p><strong> THE PITCH</strong> </p> <p> Everyone who has ever tried to get a film made is a con artist. All right, I'll amend that: everyone who has tried to set up a movie is a liar and a cheat, or at best, a big fat fibber. </p> <p>Harry Saltzman, producer of the Bond films, The Battle of Britain, and the Harry Palmer trilogy, wanted me to make the third and last Harry Palmer. \"I understand you make art films,\" he said at our first meeting. \"I like art, my house is full of it. And I'd like to make an art film with you. Anything special you have in mind?\" </p> <p>\"How about Tchaikovsky?\" I ventured. </p> <p>\"Tchaikovsky's fine,\" he said. \"In the meantime, if you wanna break into features, you've gotta start off with a sure thing. The Ipcress File and Funeral in Berlin were big box-office bonanzas and Billion Dollar Brain's gonna be the biggest yet. Get that one under your belt, get yourself a name and then we'll talk Tchaikovsky.\" </p> <p>So I let him talk me into it. </p> <p>Some time later, when I reminded him of his promise, he was deeply offended that I'd had the effrontery to bring it up. Billion Dollar Brain was not the box-office hit Harry had hoped for, so he was less than happy when I reminded him of his promise to let me make a film on Tchaikovsky. </p> <p>I did get to make that film on Tchaikovsky, but Harry didn't produce it, United Artists did. They had financed and distributed Billion Dollar Brain, and talked me into directing Women in Love. Although the Harry Palmer movie had only made a respectable financial return, the D H Lawrence movie went through the roof, so understandably they were going to look with a friendly eye on any other movie I might propose. But at the mention of the word Tchaikovsky, their faces fell. \"What's it about?\" they asked mournfully. </p> <p>\"It's about a homosexual who falls in love with a nymphomaniac,\" I said. Without another word they gave me the money. It was the most successful pitch of my life. </p> <p> <strong> CASTING</strong> </p> <p> Casting - I tremble at the very mention of the word. It's like Russian roulette, walking the plank in shark-infested waters, running over a bed of red-hot coals, jumping into a snake pit . . . </p> <p>Experience has taught me to be well on my guard and to take an actor's talents according to his CV with a large pinch of salt. Nevertheless, such is the cunning of the average thespian that they are able to slip through one's defences and pull a fast one. After all they are \"actors\" and learn their survival techniques from a very early age, as I found to my cost on Mahler. </p> <p>Casting the young Gustav was a bit of a problem, owing to the fact that he had to ride, swim and play the piano. Most of the boys I auditioned could manage two out of three, but finding a contender who could handle the lot proved difficult. Finally I settled for Gary someone or other, who assured me he was fine so far as his athletic abilities were concerned, but was a bit rusty on the piano. However, he read his lines well and looked remarkably like Robert Powell, who was playing Mahler. </p> <p>So, on the understanding that he practised the piano every day, I hired him. After all, he only had to play scales and I assumed he could manage that with ease. He was a bright boy, keen as Colman's, and desperate to do the part. </p> <p>I stopped worrying and got caught up in the hurly burly of pre-production, but still managed to phone him from time to time. Gary was never there; he was always down at the baths according to his mother, who added reassuringly that the piano tuition was coming on fine. I guess I should have smelt a rat but I had far greater problems to sort out and missed the obvious. </p> <p>What should have been obvious became horrifyingly so on choppy Derwentwater five weeks later. We had reached the point in the schedule where the young Mahler, wishing to show off to his school chums, attempts to demonstrate that he is as at home in the water as they are by plunging into the chilly waters of the lake in a foolhardy attempt to swim across it. In the event, he only manages a few yards before getting into difficulties and being ignominiously rescued. </p> <p>So, imagine the scene. There we are, with me and the camera crew in a boat moored a little offshore and young Gary poised on the water's edge in his underwear ready to plunge in, swim into close-up, become exhausted, and start to drown. Everyone knew exactly what was expected of them and we were all keyed up for the take when Gary's forlorn little voice was caught up by the wind and whipped across the choppy waters towards me. </p> <p>\"Mr Russell,\" he shouted through cupped hands. \"I've got a confession to make . . . I lied to you, I can't swim! I can only manage a few strokes.\" So that's why he was always down at the baths when he should have been practising the piano, I thought, before shouting back at him: \"Never mind, Gary, just do your best, swim out a few strokes - and then pretend to get into difficulties.\" </p> <p>\"But Mr Russell, I don't want to, I'm scared.\" \"Nonsense! You can do it if you try,\" I shouted back with a touch of steel in my voice. \"Ready now - roll camera, action!\" </p> <p>It's amazing how that word \"Action\" galvanises the mind. Even a pathetic wimp like Gary was galvanised sufficiently to wade into the water and take the plunge, for all the world like a cross-channel record-breaker. He got all of three yards, started blubbing, and waded shivering and snivelling back to shore. This was disastrous. Defeat was staring us in the face. True, we'd got him in the water and starting to swim - but that was all in long shot. We still needed a few shots in close-up of him swimming and getting into difficulties. And the drowning scene was crucial to the film - we simply had to have it. </p> <p>\"Great, Gary, we've got it,\" I shouted. \"Now just jump in a boat and we'll row you out here to discuss the next scene before the light goes.\" He wasn't happy, but before he could object, an assistant director had bundled him into a boat. </p> <p>\"Here Gary, let me give you a hand,\" I said as he was brought alongside. Trustingly he did so, whereupon I sort of lost my balance and poor Gary was hurled into the deep - as both boats pulled away from him like mad and the camera, primed for the crucial moment, purred into action. And what do you know? Gary managed to swim half a dozen strong strokes before giving up the ghost. It was the most convincing drowning scene I have ever seen. </p> <p> <strong> PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY</strong> </p> <p> The male stars of Women in Love were a problem. The nude wrestling scene was coming up. Initially they'd been very gung-ho about it, but as the shooting day drew near, their enthusiasm rapidly diminished. One of the contenders complained of a sore ankle and took to limping, while the other began to develop a cold and went about sniffing and coughing. At first I didn't take them seriously, but when they both produced doctors' certificates excusing them from stripping off regardless, I ignored their protestations, brushed aside their medical certificates and advised them to have an early night, so as to be on set the following morning, ready for the fray. </p> <p>What I didn't tell them was that I had also scheduled an alternative scene featuring the girls in case the boys dug their heels in and refused to strip off. The fateful day arrived with everyone poised ready to rush on to the alternative set in case our two unwilling protagonists should really chicken out. But dead on the stroke of 8.30am, they both strode into the baronial hall, where the fight was due to take place, whipped off their dressing-gowns without demur and stood there as naked as the day they were born - proud as peacocks. So for the rest of that day and most of the next, we shot the controversial wrestling scene that made screen history - without any sign whatever of a sore ankle or a single nasal sniff. Who or what had worked this seemingly major miracle? </p> <p>Well, when it was all over, I finally found out. The person responsible was the stand-in for the more macho of the two actors. According to his testimony, he had cajoled them into joining him for a drink at the local pub in order to drown their depression and further strengthen their resolve to stand firm in their decision. Not usually the best of friends, the alcohol mellowed them into becoming quite chummy and by the time their bladders reached bursting point, they staggered off to the outside loo, giving each other mutual support. And it was much to their mutual relief that as far as their manhood was concerned, there wasn't much to choose between them. It had all been a question of \"size\" and male vanity. Having said that, it has to be admitted that one of the contestants cheated by giving nature a helping hand just before every take. </p> <p> <strong> THE PREMIERE</strong> </p> <p> Personally I've had more than my fair share of first-night disasters, but as they evoke painful memories, they are best forgotten. I'll let just one example suffice to prove my point. It happened at the premiere of Billion Dollar Brain - my first big-time movie. </p> <p>I was sitting in the front row of the dress circle next to the film's producer, Harry Saltzman, when suddenly, on the changeover from one projector to the other at the start of reel three, the picture popped on to the screen without sound. </p> <p>\"This can't last,\" I thought to myself, \"the projectionist is bound to notice and do something about it.\" But as the agonising seconds turned into excruciating minutes and the slow hand-clapping began, I somehow overcame the slow paralysis creeping over me, sprang to my feet and went in search of an usherette. </p> <p>\"Where's the projection box?\" I shouted to a dark silhouette above the growing hubbub of protest. </p> <p>\"The wot?\" she replied. </p> <p>\"The place where they show the films.\" </p> <p>\"Search me,\" she snapped, \"you'd better ask the commissionaire.\" </p> <p>Tearing down the stairs two at a time, I found him in the foyer chatting up the refreshments girl. I repeated the question. Stunned, he stammered a reply . . . which I doubt you will believe. </p> <p>\"Straight out the swing door, guv'nor, down the first alleyway on your right, up the fire escape and across the roof to what looks like a brick shithouse - and give four raps for admittance.\" And as I ran like fury to the swing doors, his final words echoed in my ears. \"Make sure it's four knocks or they won't let you in - vandalism.\" </p> <p>Two minutes and four knocks later, I was finally admitted to the inner sanctum by an astonished, ageing projectionist - too surprised to talk. </p> <p>\"Sound!\" I screamed at him. \"There's no fucking sound!\" He took the news with surprising calm. </p> <p>\"I thought it was a bit quiet for a Bond film,\" he said, confusing his Saltzman heroes, before slowly putting down the girlie magazine that had been occupying his mind and flicking a switch, which mercifully restored the sound. Two men in smart suits now hit the scene. I recognised them as company execs. </p> <p>\"What happened?\" they said in unison. </p> <p>\"There was a blip on the automatic changeover,\" said the projectionist and left it at that. </p> <p>\"So what are we going to do?\" I said. \"We've lost nearly six minutes of important plot development; the audience won't have a clue what's happening.\" </p> <p>\"How long will it take to rewind and start the reel again?\" barked one of the execs. </p> <p>\"Give or take a minute, I'd say five minutes,\" mused the projectionist. </p> <p>\"More like 10,\" I mumbled. </p> <p>\"That's suicide,\" said the other exec, \"we'll have a riot on our hands.\" </p> <p>He was right. So, somewhat shattered, we left the film to churn on, crossed the roof, went down the fire escape, up the alley and back into the cinema, passing disgruntled patrons on their way out. What a night . . . and it wasn't over. Worse was to come - over which I will draw a veil, lest I am tempted, as I relive the debacle in my mind's eye, to cut my own throat. </p> <p>Extracted from Directing Film by Ken Russell (Batsford, <a href=\"http://www.batsford.com\">www.batsford.com</a>).</p>",

      "bodyText": "THE PITCH Everyone who has ever tried to get a film made is a con artist. All right, I'll amend that: everyone who has tried to set up a movie is a liar and a cheat, or at best, a big fat fibber. Harry Saltzman, producer of the Bond films, The Battle of Britain, and the Harry Palmer trilogy, wanted me to make the third and last Harry Palmer. \"I understand you make art films,\" he said at our first meeting. \"I like art, my house is full of it. And I'd like to make an art film with you. Anything special you have in mind?\" \"How about Tchaikovsky?\" I ventured. \"Tchaikovsky's fine,\" he said. \"In the meantime, if you wanna break into features, you've gotta start off with a sure thing. The Ipcress File and Funeral in Berlin were big box-office bonanzas and Billion Dollar Brain's gonna be the biggest yet. Get that one under your belt, get yourself a name and then we'll talk Tchaikovsky.\" So I let him talk me into it. Some time later, when I reminded him of his promise, he was deeply offended that I'd had the effrontery to bring it up. Billion Dollar Brain was not the box-office hit Harry had hoped for, so he was less than happy when I reminded him of his promise to let me make a film on Tchaikovsky. I did get to make that film on Tchaikovsky, but Harry didn't produce it, United Artists did. They had financed and distributed Billion Dollar Brain, and talked me into directing Women in Love. Although the Harry Palmer movie had only made a respectable financial return, the D H Lawrence movie went through the roof, so understandably they were going to look with a friendly eye on any other movie I might propose. But at the mention of the word Tchaikovsky, their faces fell. \"What's it about?\" they asked mournfully. \"It's about a homosexual who falls in love with a nymphomaniac,\" I said. Without another word they gave me the money. It was the most successful pitch of my life. CASTING Casting - I tremble at the very mention of the word. It's like Russian roulette, walking the plank in shark-infested waters, running over a bed of red-hot coals, jumping into a snake pit . . . Experience has taught me to be well on my guard and to take an actor's talents according to his CV with a large pinch of salt. Nevertheless, such is the cunning of the average thespian that they are able to slip through one's defences and pull a fast one. After all they are \"actors\" and learn their survival techniques from a very early age, as I found to my cost on Mahler. Casting the young Gustav was a bit of a problem, owing to the fact that he had to ride, swim and play the piano. Most of the boys I auditioned could manage two out of three, but finding a contender who could handle the lot proved difficult. Finally I settled for Gary someone or other, who assured me he was fine so far as his athletic abilities were concerned, but was a bit rusty on the piano. However, he read his lines well and looked remarkably like Robert Powell, who was playing Mahler. So, on the understanding that he practised the piano every day, I hired him. After all, he only had to play scales and I assumed he could manage that with ease. He was a bright boy, keen as Colman's, and desperate to do the part. I stopped worrying and got caught up in the hurly burly of pre-production, but still managed to phone him from time to time. Gary was never there; he was always down at the baths according to his mother, who added reassuringly that the piano tuition was coming on fine. I guess I should have smelt a rat but I had far greater problems to sort out and missed the obvious. What should have been obvious became horrifyingly so on choppy Derwentwater five weeks later. We had reached the point in the schedule where the young Mahler, wishing to show off to his school chums, attempts to demonstrate that he is as at home in the water as they are by plunging into the chilly waters of the lake in a foolhardy attempt to swim across it. In the event, he only manages a few yards before getting into difficulties and being ignominiously rescued. So, imagine the scene. There we are, with me and the camera crew in a boat moored a little offshore and young Gary poised on the water's edge in his underwear ready to plunge in, swim into close-up, become exhausted, and start to drown. Everyone knew exactly what was expected of them and we were all keyed up for the take when Gary's forlorn little voice was caught up by the wind and whipped across the choppy waters towards me. \"Mr Russell,\" he shouted through cupped hands. \"I've got a confession to make . . . I lied to you, I can't swim! I can only manage a few strokes.\" So that's why he was always down at the baths when he should have been practising the piano, I thought, before shouting back at him: \"Never mind, Gary, just do your best, swim out a few strokes - and then pretend to get into difficulties.\" \"But Mr Russell, I don't want to, I'm scared.\" \"Nonsense! You can do it if you try,\" I shouted back with a touch of steel in my voice. \"Ready now - roll camera, action!\" It's amazing how that word \"Action\" galvanises the mind. Even a pathetic wimp like Gary was galvanised sufficiently to wade into the water and take the plunge, for all the world like a cross-channel record-breaker. He got all of three yards, started blubbing, and waded shivering and snivelling back to shore. This was disastrous. Defeat was staring us in the face. True, we'd got him in the water and starting to swim - but that was all in long shot. We still needed a few shots in close-up of him swimming and getting into difficulties. And the drowning scene was crucial to the film - we simply had to have it. \"Great, Gary, we've got it,\" I shouted. \"Now just jump in a boat and we'll row you out here to discuss the next scene before the light goes.\" He wasn't happy, but before he could object, an assistant director had bundled him into a boat. \"Here Gary, let me give you a hand,\" I said as he was brought alongside. Trustingly he did so, whereupon I sort of lost my balance and poor Gary was hurled into the deep - as both boats pulled away from him like mad and the camera, primed for the crucial moment, purred into action. And what do you know? Gary managed to swim half a dozen strong strokes before giving up the ghost. It was the most convincing drowning scene I have ever seen. PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY The male stars of Women in Love were a problem. The nude wrestling scene was coming up. Initially they'd been very gung-ho about it, but as the shooting day drew near, their enthusiasm rapidly diminished. One of the contenders complained of a sore ankle and took to limping, while the other began to develop a cold and went about sniffing and coughing. At first I didn't take them seriously, but when they both produced doctors' certificates excusing them from stripping off regardless, I ignored their protestations, brushed aside their medical certificates and advised them to have an early night, so as to be on set the following morning, ready for the fray. What I didn't tell them was that I had also scheduled an alternative scene featuring the girls in case the boys dug their heels in and refused to strip off. The fateful day arrived with everyone poised ready to rush on to the alternative set in case our two unwilling protagonists should really chicken out. But dead on the stroke of 8.30am, they both strode into the baronial hall, where the fight was due to take place, whipped off their dressing-gowns without demur and stood there as naked as the day they were born - proud as peacocks. So for the rest of that day and most of the next, we shot the controversial wrestling scene that made screen history - without any sign whatever of a sore ankle or a single nasal sniff. Who or what had worked this seemingly major miracle? Well, when it was all over, I finally found out. The person responsible was the stand-in for the more macho of the two actors. According to his testimony, he had cajoled them into joining him for a drink at the local pub in order to drown their depression and further strengthen their resolve to stand firm in their decision. Not usually the best of friends, the alcohol mellowed them into becoming quite chummy and by the time their bladders reached bursting point, they staggered off to the outside loo, giving each other mutual support. And it was much to their mutual relief that as far as their manhood was concerned, there wasn't much to choose between them. It had all been a question of \"size\" and male vanity. Having said that, it has to be admitted that one of the contestants cheated by giving nature a helping hand just before every take. THE PREMIERE Personally I've had more than my fair share of first-night disasters, but as they evoke painful memories, they are best forgotten. I'll let just one example suffice to prove my point. It happened at the premiere of Billion Dollar Brain - my first big-time movie. I was sitting in the front row of the dress circle next to the film's producer, Harry Saltzman, when suddenly, on the changeover from one projector to the other at the start of reel three, the picture popped on to the screen without sound. \"This can't last,\" I thought to myself, \"the projectionist is bound to notice and do something about it.\" But as the agonising seconds turned into excruciating minutes and the slow hand-clapping began, I somehow overcame the slow paralysis creeping over me, sprang to my feet and went in search of an usherette. \"Where's the projection box?\" I shouted to a dark silhouette above the growing hubbub of protest. \"The wot?\" she replied. \"The place where they show the films.\" \"Search me,\" she snapped, \"you'd better ask the commissionaire.\" Tearing down the stairs two at a time, I found him in the foyer chatting up the refreshments girl. I repeated the question. Stunned, he stammered a reply . . . which I doubt you will believe. \"Straight out the swing door, guv'nor, down the first alleyway on your right, up the fire escape and across the roof to what looks like a brick shithouse - and give four raps for admittance.\" And as I ran like fury to the swing doors, his final words echoed in my ears. \"Make sure it's four knocks or they won't let you in - vandalism.\" Two minutes and four knocks later, I was finally admitted to the inner sanctum by an astonished, ageing projectionist - too surprised to talk. \"Sound!\" I screamed at him. \"There's no fucking sound!\" He took the news with surprising calm. \"I thought it was a bit quiet for a Bond film,\" he said, confusing his Saltzman heroes, before slowly putting down the girlie magazine that had been occupying his mind and flicking a switch, which mercifully restored the sound. Two men in smart suits now hit the scene. I recognised them as company execs. \"What happened?\" they said in unison. \"There was a blip on the automatic changeover,\" said the projectionist and left it at that. \"So what are we going to do?\" I said. \"We've lost nearly six minutes of important plot development; the audience won't have a clue what's happening.\" \"How long will it take to rewind and start the reel again?\" barked one of the execs. \"Give or take a minute, I'd say five minutes,\" mused the projectionist. \"More like 10,\" I mumbled. \"That's suicide,\" said the other exec, \"we'll have a riot on our hands.\" He was right. So, somewhat shattered, we left the film to churn on, crossed the roof, went down the fire escape, up the alley and back into the cinema, passing disgruntled patrons on their way out. What a night . . . and it wasn't over. Worse was to come - over which I will draw a veil, lest I am tempted, as I relive the debacle in my mind's eye, to cut my own throat.

While Vinnie, Fash and Wisey were the heart of the Crazy Gang, Sanchez was in the More Serious Gang along with Gibson and Dave Beasant. </p> <p>\"I looked at all those antics and thought, 'They're not for me,\"' says the former grammar school boy with a university degree in management. \"But, though we were not the greatest mates off the field, once we put the shirt on we became part of a team. </p> <p>\"That's what unnerved Liverpool. In the tunnel before that final you could see they were nervous. They wouldn't make eye contact. They were saying to themselves, 'Hang on a minute, they're not in awe of us.' And they were right. It was the biggest day of our careers.\" </p> <p>Sanchez has only one complaint of that day: \"When I scored the goal Wisey jumped on me and in all the pictures afterwards he is covering my face.\" </p> <p>The memories are recalled with a twinkle, for Sanchez loves his football. He calls being a manager a lifestyle, not a job. And, though he pores over his statistics and videos with scholarly enthusiasm, he is no dry intellectual. The 41-year-old is refreshingly clear in his decisions and human in his dealings. He will never put a team sheet up before calling in the players who have been dropped and explaining why. </p> <p>Sanchez, who came through the tragic death of his wife with breast cancer three years ago, took over a demoralised set-up at Adams Park a year later and saved them from relegation to the Third Division. </p> <p>It is his first management job in the Football League but this season, after wheeling and dealing with limited financial resources, he harbours hopes of reaching the Second Division play-offs. Injuries are a problem, with last season's top scorer Sean Devine out long-term and the current top hot-shot Andy Rammell struggling to be fit for tomorrow's sell-out tie. </p> <p>But it appears that neither injuries, nor his beloved Wimbledon, will stop the inevitable rise of Sanchez. \"I always wanted to be a manager,\" he says. \"I had already taken my coaching badge before that famous final. Now I am following in the footsteps of two well-known managers here, in Martin O'Neill and John Gregory. In five years' time I hope I'll have become the third to be managing at the top level.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But, despite the Wimbledon link, do not expect any tracksuit-burning stunts or decapitated socks in the Wycombe Wanderers dressing-room. While Vinnie, Fash and Wisey were the heart of the Crazy Gang, Sanchez was in the More Serious Gang along with Gibson and Dave Beasant. \"I looked at all those antics and thought, 'They're not for me,\"' says the former grammar school boy with a university degree in management. \"But, though we were not the greatest mates off the field, once we put the shirt on we became part of a team. \"That's what unnerved Liverpool. In the tunnel before that final you could see they were nervous. They wouldn't make eye contact. They were saying to themselves, 'Hang on a minute, they're not in awe of us.' And they were right. It was the biggest day of our careers.\" Sanchez has only one complaint of that day: \"When I scored the goal Wisey jumped on me and in all the pictures afterwards he is covering my face.\" The memories are recalled with a twinkle, for Sanchez loves his football. He calls being a manager a lifestyle, not a job. And, though he pores over his statistics and videos with scholarly enthusiasm, he is no dry intellectual. The 41-year-old is refreshingly clear in his decisions and human in his dealings. He will never put a team sheet up before calling in the players who have been dropped and explaining why. Sanchez, who came through the tragic death of his wife with breast cancer three years ago, took over a demoralised set-up at Adams Park a year later and saved them from relegation to the Third Division. It is his first management job in the Football League but this season, after wheeling and dealing with limited financial resources, he harbours hopes of reaching the Second Division play-offs. Injuries are a problem, with last season's top scorer Sean Devine out long-term and the current top hot-shot Andy Rammell struggling to be fit for tomorrow's sell-out tie. But it appears that neither injuries, nor his beloved Wimbledon, will stop the inevitable rise of Sanchez. \"I always wanted to be a manager,\" he says. \"I had already taken my coaching badge before that famous final. Now I am following in the footsteps of two well-known managers here, in Martin O'Neill and John Gregory. In five years' time I hope I'll have become the third to be managing at the top level.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>News that Norwich Union is refusing to sell mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) to Rover staff in Birmingham is a prime example of insurer 'cherry picking', but it's also worth considering if this type of insurance is even worth having.</p> <p>MPPI is not the right insurance for everyone with a mortgage. The Financial Services Ombudsman has said it is expecting a 20% rise in complaints on the issue this year linked, including many who have lost their jobs but had claims rejected. </p> <p>For example, MPPI, frequently does not cover people who lose their jobs as a result of stress-related illness. Furthermore, MPPI usually pays out for just a year - yet some policyholders are under the impression it will cover their mortgage until they find another job, even if this takes longer. </p> <p>Before anyone considers buying the cover, they need to be clear that they understand exactly what it is and whether it is being offered at a fair price and what the alternatives are.</p> <p>First time buyers, in particular, should beware of pressure selling tactics from advisers and lenders.</p> <p>MPPI will usually cover the monthly mortgage payments for up twelve months, starting one or two months after an accident, illness or unemployment happens. Some policies will only protect against redundancy and so are cheaper. This can be useful in households that rely on a single income, although in areas of high unemployment, 12 months may not be long enough to find another job, or might not be enough to cover time off work though an accident or sickness.</p> <p>Despite its limitations, sales of MPPI are rising. At the end of last year, around a third of all new mortgages were protected by the insurance. The government is also keen for sales to grow to stop reliance on the state. And certainly MPPI is an improvement on the state's provisions.</p> <p>Those on income support or jobseekers allowance have to wait 26 weeks before receiving assistance with eligible mortgage interest, if their mortgage pre-dates October, 1995.</p> <p>For the first eight weeks, they receive no assistance at all and the next 18 weeks they get up to 50% of the eligible interest.</p> <p>Borrowers taking out a mortgage after October, 1995, would have to wait 39 weeks obtaining full assistance with mortgage interest and in the meantime receive no help at all.</p> <p>Stephen Devine, general manager of corporate communications at Pinnacle Insurance, one of the main MPPI providers for high street lenders says: \"This is a product designed to be a sticking plaster. It is essential those buying it realise it is short term and is meant to keep you afloat until you find another job.\"</p> <p>He explains that the average person who is made redundant takes around 150 days to find another job and adds that one in five people will become unemployed at some stage of their working lives.</p> <p>But, it is also worth remembering there are alternatives. Siobhan Hotten, marketing manager for mortgage advisers, John Charcol says: \"We do recommend MPPI for some people, but it is not suitable for everyone.

      "bodyText": "News that Norwich Union is refusing to sell mortgage payment protection insurance (MPPI) to Rover staff in Birmingham is a prime example of insurer 'cherry picking', but it's also worth considering if this type of insurance is even worth having. MPPI is not the right insurance for everyone with a mortgage. The Financial Services Ombudsman has said it is expecting a 20% rise in complaints on the issue this year linked, including many who have lost their jobs but had claims rejected. For example, MPPI, frequently does not cover people who lose their jobs as a result of stress-related illness. Furthermore, MPPI usually pays out for just a year - yet some policyholders are under the impression it will cover their mortgage until they find another job, even if this takes longer. Before anyone considers buying the cover, they need to be clear that they understand exactly what it is and whether it is being offered at a fair price and what the alternatives are. First time buyers, in particular, should beware of pressure selling tactics from advisers and lenders. MPPI will usually cover the monthly mortgage payments for up twelve months, starting one or two months after an accident, illness or unemployment happens. Some policies will only protect against redundancy and so are cheaper. This can be useful in households that rely on a single income, although in areas of high unemployment, 12 months may not be long enough to find another job, or might not be enough to cover time off work though an accident or sickness. Despite its limitations, sales of MPPI are rising. At the end of last year, around a third of all new mortgages were protected by the insurance. The government is also keen for sales to grow to stop reliance on the state. And certainly MPPI is an improvement on the state's provisions. Those on income support or jobseekers allowance have to wait 26 weeks before receiving assistance with eligible mortgage interest, if their mortgage pre-dates October, 1995. For the first eight weeks, they receive no assistance at all and the next 18 weeks they get up to 50% of the eligible interest. Borrowers taking out a mortgage after October, 1995, would have to wait 39 weeks obtaining full assistance with mortgage interest and in the meantime receive no help at all. Stephen Devine, general manager of corporate communications at Pinnacle Insurance, one of the main MPPI providers for high street lenders says: \"This is a product designed to be a sticking plaster. It is essential those buying it realise it is short term and is meant to keep you afloat until you find another job.\" He explains that the average person who is made redundant takes around 150 days to find another job and adds that one in five people will become unemployed at some stage of their working lives. But, it is also worth remembering there are alternatives. Siobhan Hotten, marketing manager for mortgage advisers, John Charcol says: \"We do recommend MPPI for some people, but it is not suitable for everyone. In some cases, redundancy cover on its own is cheaper and more relevant if other benefits are supplied through work.\" She believes critical illness cover provides far greater peace of mind if someone becomes seriously ill such as with a heart attack or cancer as MPPI does not cover for a long enough recovery time. Income protection is another option. It pays an income - typically around 60% of salary - until the claimant returns to work or retires. Like critical illness cover, this will cost more than MPPI, although is viewed by many as more valuable. The average price of MPPI is around \u00a35.60 per \u00a3100 of benefit to be paid. But, there are variations. Marks &amp; Spencer Financial Services is well priced at \u00a34 per \u00a3100 of benefit, while the cheapest in the Market Harborough Building Society sells the cover at \u00a31.75 per \u00a3100 - little more than its cost value - but this is only available to those taking out a Market Harborough mortgage. Market Harborough has defended its stance and says there is an argument for compulsion, according to spokeswoman Alison Dodd. She says the cover helps prevent arrears and its customers having to rely on state benefits. But, it is also worth remembering that having the insurance in place is not a guarantee against repossession. A survey by Mortgage Finance Gazette found 47% of lenders would continue with repossession even if the homeowner had the cover. Details on MPPI can be found on the Association of British Insurers' website. Checklist before you buy MPPI What is the cost? Compare your quote against the average price of \u00a35.60 - and this is the top end of average - per \u00a3100 of benefit. If the cover is very cheap, check to see if there is a longer waiting period before you claim. 30 days is average. If you have savings, it may be worth buying a cheaper policy and waiting 60 days. Are you considering becoming self-employed? Check if the cover would still be valid (unlikely). Do you have any health problems? This again could invalidate payment. Look at other options Critical illness or income protection insurance can be an alternative. Don\u00eat forget that MPPI is only a short-term product. It is unlikely to pay out for more than 12 months. What other benefits do you have through work? If your health is covered, it could be cheaper to buy redundancy only cover. Consider seeing an independent financial adviser before buying MPPI.",
