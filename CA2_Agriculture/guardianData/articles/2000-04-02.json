      "bodyText": "Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday insisted that his party had no plans to run into the arms of Labour, as he insisted that the Lib Dems would exert most influence by continuing to go it alone. His remarks came after the prime minister, Tony Blair disclosed in a magazine interview that he still nurtured hopes of reuniting the centre left of politics with a coalition or alliance between Labour and the Lib Dems. Both parties were \"driven by the same value systems\", he said. Mr Kennedy, who has adopted a significantly cooler relationship with Labour than his predecessor, Paddy Ashdown, suggested he had thought Mr Blair's remarks - published on April 1 - were a joke, adding: \"I don't think we should hold our breath.\" He told the Jonathan Dimbleby programme, on LWT: \"I do not think you can run a political organisation on the basis of always thinking of yourselves as some kind of adjunct to another political organisation.\" While Mr Blair, riding high in the polls, can afford some expansive speculation over a grand coalition of progressive opinion, the Lib Dem leader must carve out a distinctive niche for his party in advance of local elections next month and a possible general election next year. In his clearest attempt since taking over as Lib Dem leader to distance himself from Labour, he said: \"I think we've got more influence and more input in British politics by being ourselves, not by ... trying to be something else in partnership with others.\" Only if the \"electoral arithmetic\" were right would such an option be under consideration, Mr Kennedy said. Mr Ashdown was deprived of a place in Mr Blair's cabinet as a result of just such arithmetic, according to the prime minister's interview in the American magazine Talk, published this week. Interviewer Robert Harris, a friend of the prime minister who was with him on election night in May 1997, claims Mr Blair now regards his failure to bring Mr Ashdown on board as possibly his greatest mistake in office. The scale of Labour's victory made the planned move im possible, and he had to drop the idea. However, Mr Blair's continued mulling over the possibility of a centre left alliance will prompt speculation that plans for closer links will be revived in the event of a tight general election result. Nevertheless, the prime minister is far ahead of the majority of his party in contemplating a coalition. He faces a battle in the meantime over whether Labour should restate its commitment to a referendum on a proportional representation voting system for Westminster in its next general election manifesto - a proposition being resisted by many Labour MPs and trade unions but which represents the Lib Dems' price for continued cooperation. Mr Kennedy, who claims to be unworried by poll ratings showing that 54% of voters have no opinion of him, once again rejected suggestions that he is failing to make an impact as leader. His party has dropped two points to 14% in the polls, while William Hague's Tories have inched up from 27 to 29% - both trailing far behind Labour.",

      "body": "<p>Talks between Microsoft and the US government have broken down after four months, opening the way for a legal judgment later this week in the landmark anti-monopolies battle that could end in the break-up of the world's most valuable company. </p> <p>Judge Richard Posner, who had been charged with trying to bring the two sides together, on Saturday described his quest to prevent the two-year-old battle running on for several more years as fruitless. </p> <p>In an aggressive response, Microsoft blamed the breakdown on differences of opinion between the US justice de partment and the 19 US states party to the action. Bill Gates, the company's founder, said that he and his team had spent thousands of hours trying to reach a settlement. </p> <p>\"Microsoft offered significant concessions in the interest of ending this case,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it became impossible to settle because the department of justice and the states were not working together. Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a break-up of our company or other extreme concessions that go far beyond the issues raised in the lawsuit.\" </p> <p>Joel Klein, head of the justice department's anti-trust division, regretted the failure to reach an agreement but added that: \"Settlement for settlement's sake would be pointless.\" </p> <p>He said the government would \"seek a remedy that prevents Microsoft from using its monopoly position to disable competition, hamper innovation and limit customer choice.\" </p> <p>With settlement talks over, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, in charge of the entire case, is expected to deliver his verdict this week on whether Microsoft broke the law. Both Microsoft and the government expect him to rule against the company after his preliminary ruling, delivered last November, found that the software company had harmed consumers and competitors. He may not rule on a potential remedy for such abuse until later this summer. </p> <p>Settlement talks broke down over an effective remedy. The company is understood to have offered concessions including unbundling its internet browser from Windows, the operating system software used on more than 90% of the world's computers. The concessions failed to satisfy a government side sceptical about whether they could be enforced. </p> <p>In a last-minute intervention, some of the US states are understood to have asked for far tougher restrictions, in cluding a promise not to tie future products to Windows. </p> <p>Microsoft is also understood to have rejected a proposal that it develop a version of its software for the Linux operating system.

      "bodyText": "Talks between Microsoft and the US government have broken down after four months, opening the way for a legal judgment later this week in the landmark anti-monopolies battle that could end in the break-up of the world's most valuable company. Judge Richard Posner, who had been charged with trying to bring the two sides together, on Saturday described his quest to prevent the two-year-old battle running on for several more years as fruitless. In an aggressive response, Microsoft blamed the breakdown on differences of opinion between the US justice de partment and the 19 US states party to the action. Bill Gates, the company's founder, said that he and his team had spent thousands of hours trying to reach a settlement. \"Microsoft offered significant concessions in the interest of ending this case,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it became impossible to settle because the department of justice and the states were not working together. Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a break-up of our company or other extreme concessions that go far beyond the issues raised in the lawsuit.\" Joel Klein, head of the justice department's anti-trust division, regretted the failure to reach an agreement but added that: \"Settlement for settlement's sake would be pointless.\" He said the government would \"seek a remedy that prevents Microsoft from using its monopoly position to disable competition, hamper innovation and limit customer choice.\" With settlement talks over, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, in charge of the entire case, is expected to deliver his verdict this week on whether Microsoft broke the law. Both Microsoft and the government expect him to rule against the company after his preliminary ruling, delivered last November, found that the software company had harmed consumers and competitors. He may not rule on a potential remedy for such abuse until later this summer. Settlement talks broke down over an effective remedy. The company is understood to have offered concessions including unbundling its internet browser from Windows, the operating system software used on more than 90% of the world's computers. The concessions failed to satisfy a government side sceptical about whether they could be enforced. In a last-minute intervention, some of the US states are understood to have asked for far tougher restrictions, in cluding a promise not to tie future products to Windows. Microsoft is also understood to have rejected a proposal that it develop a version of its software for the Linux operating system. In admitting defeat, Judge Posner spoke of the extent of differences between the world's largest software company and government forces. \"It is apparent that the disagreements among the parties concerning the likely course, outcome and consequences of continued litigation, as well as the implications and ramifications of alternative terms of settlement, are too deep-seated to be bridged,\" he said. Taking a side-swipe at both sides for \"a good deal of leak ing and spinning\" during the long drawn-out process, he said that there had been almost 20 successive drafts of a possible consent decree. Microsoft's advisers are betting that a court ruling could be more favourable. They believe that the longer the case goes on, the more the competitive landscape will change. They also have one eye on the US presidential elections in November. George W Bush, the Republican party contender, has indicated disaffection with the government's case against the company. Microsoft shares are expected to be hit by the end of settlement talks when they start trading today.",

      "trailText": "<p>Discrimination against older people in the workplace is the last form of acceptable prejudice.

      "body": "<p>Discrimination against older people in the workplace is the last form of acceptable prejudice. Employers can assume that the skills of older people are outdated and their attitudes to work inferior - and decide not to hire them accordingly. And it's all perfectly legal. </p> <p>But the government has taken a significant step in the battle to increase the number of older people in jobs. A new scheme to help the over-50s out of long-term unemployment is launched today as part of the welfare to work programme. New Deal 50+ will provide personal advice, job-search help and a training grant of up to \u00a3750 to anyone on benefits who is over 50 and has been unemployed for six months or more. The scheme also offers an employment credit of \u00a360 a week for up to a year, and a guarantees a minimum take-home income of \u00a3170 a week if they find a full-time job. </p> <p>Great news, one would think, for those who have been campaiging for wider recognition of older people's skills. But pressure groups have given the scheme only a cautious welcome. Sally Greengross, director general of Age Concern, wants reassurance that the deal will lead to real jobs at the end: \"People over 50 are a valuable asset to the workforce, particularly in our future ageing society. But many are finding it increasingly difficult to get good well-paid jobs regardless of their skills. We hope the training advice and financial help given is matched with good employment opportunities.\" </p> <p>Another criticism is that the scheme is not open to every older person. In addition to the 300,000 over-50s who are registered unemployed, there are a further 1m \"hidden unemployed\" between the ages of 50 and 64. Jane Cook, spokeswoman for the campaigning charity Third Age Employment Network, thinks that restricting the support to those on benefits is too limiting. \"There are an awful lot of people who are not on benefits who also want to work. We need more accessibility, and more age diversity. What we really need is a change of attitude.\" </p> <p>In a recent survey carried out by the Employers Forum on Age (EFA), 94% of secretaries surveyed believed that ageism exists in the workplace. One in three felt they had been rejected for jobs because of their age, and over 90% believed they stood little chance of getting a new job once they reached 45. Over half of managers questioned in a survey by the Institute of Management admitted they used age as a criteria for recruitment, and the number of unemployed men over 50 has climbed by 20% in 20 years. Any moves to counteract this ingrained prejudice are surely welcome. </p> <p>But the government has not set up the scheme purely out of generosity. Within the next five years, more than a third of the labour force will be over 45, and within a decade the figure will rise to 40%. By this stage, 16- to 24-year-olds will make up less than a fifth of the workforce. The govern ment estimates that early retirement is already costing the country \u00a316bn a year.

      "bodyText": "Discrimination against older people in the workplace is the last form of acceptable prejudice. Employers can assume that the skills of older people are outdated and their attitudes to work inferior - and decide not to hire them accordingly. And it's all perfectly legal. But the government has taken a significant step in the battle to increase the number of older people in jobs. A new scheme to help the over-50s out of long-term unemployment is launched today as part of the welfare to work programme. New Deal 50+ will provide personal advice, job-search help and a training grant of up to \u00a3750 to anyone on benefits who is over 50 and has been unemployed for six months or more. The scheme also offers an employment credit of \u00a360 a week for up to a year, and a guarantees a minimum take-home income of \u00a3170 a week if they find a full-time job. Great news, one would think, for those who have been campaiging for wider recognition of older people's skills. But pressure groups have given the scheme only a cautious welcome. Sally Greengross, director general of Age Concern, wants reassurance that the deal will lead to real jobs at the end: \"People over 50 are a valuable asset to the workforce, particularly in our future ageing society. But many are finding it increasingly difficult to get good well-paid jobs regardless of their skills. We hope the training advice and financial help given is matched with good employment opportunities.\" Another criticism is that the scheme is not open to every older person.

Trying to meet deadlines in the office and still get home in time to bath the children and read them a bedtime story is a constant struggle. So there is little surprise that working parents have been among the first to applaud the government's promise to consider introducing paid parental leave for mothers and fathers taking time out to bring up children. </p> <p>The logic in favour of reform is clear. As it stands, the European Union directive introduced last December means that all parents now have the right to a minimum of 13 weeks leave - without pay - which may be taken at any time until each child is five years old. </p> <p>\"But let's face it, it's an expensive option, one that many mums and dads can only dream of,\" says Dianah Worman, adviser to the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Consequently, low-paid parents have to sit in envy watching their wealthier colleagues take advantage of a law that they cannot.\" She points to a law passed by the Clinton administration in 1993 giving parents in the US similar rights. The law was certainly popular, but take-up among families on low incomes was vastly reduced. </p> <p>Paid parental leave must be the answer, right? Wrong, argues Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors (IoD). \"Current maternity rights already make 45% of IoD members think twice about hiring young women, and the introduction of paid parental leave would compound this,\" she says. \"It's not a matter of breaking the sex discrimination act, it's simply a matter of running your firm to survive. Our members have to run businesses in a tough competitive environment - even our female members take the same attitude to hiring women as opposed to men.\" </p> <p>Andrew Parkinson from the British Chambers of Commerce agrees. The parent of three pre-schoolers, he argues, might be looking at an entitlement of well over six months in a single year. \"Employers, understandably, aren't going to see you as the pick of the crop in the interview session.\" </p> <p>Although parental leave is open to both men and women, it is undoubtedly women who are most likely to take it. Consider Tony Blair's decision last week not to take paternity leave when his baby is born in May. \"And consider the current situation with career breaks,\" says a spokesperson from the Industrial Society. \"Reports show that very few male employees take up the option in comparison to women and that when women take it, it's usually for family commitments.\" </p> <p>In fact, last week many small businesses opposed the government's announcement, claiming they would rather choose to develop their own policies on parental leave. Nearly half of the firms responding to a survey by the BCC already offer paternity leave, and 94% allow time for family emergencies. </p> <p>\"There is a perception that firms, particularly smaller ones, would be Dickensian if they had the chance, but the reality is that the vast majority now recognise the benefits of family-friendly policies, notably productivity and staff retention,\" says Parkinson. \"Smaller companies are often the most family friendly because the relationships between employer and employee are so much tighter.\" </p> <p>Worman adds that staff in large companies may also suffer as a result of paid parental leave. After five years' service at Apple Computer, for instance, staff are expected to take a one-month paid break, on to which they can add some annual leave. Likewise, McDonald's offers paid leave of eight weeks to employees with ten years' service. And at Tesco, staff can take as many as five years on an unpaid career break even if they have only worked there a short time. \"By bringing in set-in-stone regulations about parental leave into such companies,\" she argues, \"these kinds of schemes - which are more generous than the government's - may have to be thrown out altogether to make room for the new law. </p> <p>\"Nobody is saying that parents shouldn't get free child care, just that any arrangements should be developed to meet the needs of both the individual employer and employee,\" says Worman. \"The same goes for employees requiring time off to care for elderly or disabled relatives who, after all, should not be forgotten in this debate.\" Parental leave of any kind needs to be flexible, even tailor-made. What employers and government must realise, she argues, is that one size does not fit all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harassed working parents know all about the work/life balance. Trying to meet deadlines in the office and still get home in time to bath the children and read them a bedtime story is a constant struggle. So there is little surprise that working parents have been among the first to applaud the government's promise to consider introducing paid parental leave for mothers and fathers taking time out to bring up children. The logic in favour of reform is clear. As it stands, the European Union directive introduced last December means that all parents now have the right to a minimum of 13 weeks leave - without pay - which may be taken at any time until each child is five years old. \"But let's face it, it's an expensive option, one that many mums and dads can only dream of,\" says Dianah Worman, adviser to the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Consequently, low-paid parents have to sit in envy watching their wealthier colleagues take advantage of a law that they cannot.\" She points to a law passed by the Clinton administration in 1993 giving parents in the US similar rights. The law was certainly popular, but take-up among families on low incomes was vastly reduced. Paid parental leave must be the answer, right? Wrong, argues Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors (IoD). \"Current maternity rights already make 45% of IoD members think twice about hiring young women, and the introduction of paid parental leave would compound this,\" she says. \"It's not a matter of breaking the sex discrimination act, it's simply a matter of running your firm to survive. Our members have to run businesses in a tough competitive environment - even our female members take the same attitude to hiring women as opposed to men.\" Andrew Parkinson from the British Chambers of Commerce agrees. The parent of three pre-schoolers, he argues, might be looking at an entitlement of well over six months in a single year. \"Employers, understandably, aren't going to see you as the pick of the crop in the interview session.\" Although parental leave is open to both men and women, it is undoubtedly women who are most likely to take it. Consider Tony Blair's decision last week not to take paternity leave when his baby is born in May. \"And consider the current situation with career breaks,\" says a spokesperson from the Industrial Society. \"Reports show that very few male employees take up the option in comparison to women and that when women take it, it's usually for family commitments.\" In fact, last week many small businesses opposed the government's announcement, claiming they would rather choose to develop their own policies on parental leave. Nearly half of the firms responding to a survey by the BCC already offer paternity leave, and 94% allow time for family emergencies. \"There is a perception that firms, particularly smaller ones, would be Dickensian if they had the chance, but the reality is that the vast majority now recognise the benefits of family-friendly policies, notably productivity and staff retention,\" says Parkinson. \"Smaller companies are often the most family friendly because the relationships between employer and employee are so much tighter.\" Worman adds that staff in large companies may also suffer as a result of paid parental leave. After five years' service at Apple Computer, for instance, staff are expected to take a one-month paid break, on to which they can add some annual leave. Likewise, McDonald's offers paid leave of eight weeks to employees with ten years' service. And at Tesco, staff can take as many as five years on an unpaid career break even if they have only worked there a short time. \"By bringing in set-in-stone regulations about parental leave into such companies,\" she argues, \"these kinds of schemes - which are more generous than the government's - may have to be thrown out altogether to make room for the new law. \"Nobody is saying that parents shouldn't get free child care, just that any arrangements should be developed to meet the needs of both the individual employer and employee,\" says Worman. \"The same goes for employees requiring time off to care for elderly or disabled relatives who, after all, should not be forgotten in this debate.\" Parental leave of any kind needs to be flexible, even tailor-made. What employers and government must realise, she argues, is that one size does not fit all.",

Last week Porter took the old AR43 off the shelf in his radio room - a shed in the garden of his home near the border with the Republic - and dusted it down. About 18in long and 6in wide, the metal box is painted Army green and looks primitive. Porter said he was constantly surprised at the poor condition and lack of sophistication of the Army radio pieces passed on to him. They were much less advanced than the hand-me-downs he got from the American base at Clooney, just outside Derry. His most prized possession - from the Americans - is a 100ft aerial used during the Cuban missile crisis to relay messages from President Kennedy in Washington to Khrushchev in Moscow. That link was 'secure', of course. \u0095 Peter Pringle is co-author with Philip Jacobson of 'Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?' - Bloody Sunday, January 30, 1972, to be published this week by Fourth Estate.",

Rover workers were joined by families, church leaders and union officials waving placards, whistling, chanting and wearing carnations donated by a local wealthy businessman in one of the biggest peaceful civil protests seen since Labour won the General Election.

In an interview with The Observer Morris warned the Government that rising hostility will translate into electoral problems. 'I think the Government would be shortsighted if it operates on the notion that its core voters have got nowhere to go,' he said. So far unions appear to accept the Government's insistence that BMW's desertion of Rover, with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, came as a nasty shock. Now fresh blows from Honda, which has revealed plans to cut production in the UK by half, and Ford - and a rash of factory closures in the textile industry - have provoked the strongest sign yet of a split between Labour and its traditional allies. The Observer has also learned that BMW is to banish 100 British design workers from its Munich base just weeks after some of them arrived there, having sold their houses in England and relocated with their families.

But yesterday I watched as President Robert Mugabe's thugs brought it to a violent climax, singling out whites, beating one man unconscious and badly injuring at least a dozen others. As blood streamed down my face, I asked myself: what has become of Zimbabwe?</p> <p>About 200 thugs used bricks, crowbars and stones. A rock so large it must have taken two hands to lift it, hit me on the jaw. I was not aware that blood was flowing from my face as I watched the gang throw people down and beat them with steel bars and pickaxe handles.</p> <p>One man lay unconscious and convulsing on the pavement, blood seeping from his mouth.</p> <p>Riot police broke up the crowd with tear gas. People ran in all directions. The injured sought shelter in shops. We used a mobile phone to call an ambulance for the unconscious man.</p> <p>Another victim, Richard Calder, stood with his shirt ripped off, his back covered in cuts and his shoulder bleeding. Before being taken away for treatment, he said: 'I was in the peaceful march, carrying nothing more than a piece of paper. They attacked me with pickaxe handles and steel bars. We were peaceful and we were attacked by thugs. The police did nothing to prevent those thugs from attacking us.</p> <p>'We were a Christian march against violence. We wanted to promote peace and justice. Our country is being led into anarchy by our leaders.'</p> <p>I carried on interviewing victims of the attack. Then someone returned my spectacles to me and said they were sorry about the blood on my face. I hadn't noticed. A Zimbabwean journalist offered me a lift home but the street was blocked by the gang of Mugabe supporters who were coming up the street again. They were shouting 'Hokoyi ' (Watch out!) and threatening people, both black and white.</p> <p>The group of independence war veterans who had ambushed the peaceful protesters continued to rampage through the city for more than an hour.</p> <p>People told me to hide as the gang wanted to beat up whites. As I crouched behind a car, my thoughts were dark.</p> <p>Clearly tensions are reaching boiling point. In a desperate bid to cling to power and to overcome the overwhelming unpopularity of his government, Mugabe is using threats, thugs and violence.</p> <p>'I warn enemies of our unity that death will befall them first,' said Mugabe at a rally this month. Last week he warned that his opponents would meet with 'very, very, very severe violence'. That is not the language of a national leader, that is the inflammatory language of a thug. Some dismiss Mugabe's statements as political rhetoric, but I say those statements incited the violence that erupted in Harare yesterday.</p> <p>He has broken down respect for the rule of law by urging supporters to invade white-owned farms and claim them as their own. He has made the police a partisan force that does not protect all citizens. Instead they are being used to threaten and harass the opposition and to stand by and watch as government supporters take the law into their own hands.</p> <p>I thought of the elderly white woman carrying a placard an hour earlier. It had a headline from the state newspaper, the Herald , which said 'Mugabe threatens violence' and under it she wrote 'All we want is freedom of choice and honest government'. She got approving cheers from scores of blacks.</p> <p>The Peace March started off well enough yesterday morning. It was planned by the National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of church groups, human rights groups, gay rights supporters and other civic organisations.</p> <p>'The time for uprooting lawlessness and violence is now! The time for building healing and planting peace is now!' said the flyers distributed to promote the march. It is a measure of Mugabe's increasing isolation that his government viewed this march as a threat.</p> <p>Police set up roadblocks circling Harare early yesterday morning and prevented thousands of people from gathering in the city centre. But a few hundred gathered at the Causeway Post Office. Riot police with tear gas and truncheons broke up the crowd, but then organisers unfurled large banners saying 'March for Peace and Reconciliation' and they quickly reassembled. Many young people had flowers in their hair and the peace symbols from the 1960s.</p> <p>The riot police formed a cordon around the group of 200 and refused to let them move, despite a court order declaring the march legal. The marchers sat in the street.</p> <p>Human rights activist Mike Auret led the group in a prayer. 'Let us build peace and order in our nation. Let us build a nation of which we can be proud and at peace with one another.'</p> <p>The prayer unnerved the police and they began to waver. 'I feel sorry for you,' said one woman to the officers. 'You are being ordered to do something that you know is wrong. Look at how peaceful we are.'</p> <p>It did the trick. The police lost their will and the marchers moved forward, swelling to more than 1,000. Holding banners and placards high, they marched through Harare, receiving cheers and waves from shoppers.</p> <p>Marchers shouted 'Let's change things!', the slogan of a new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). They also gave the open-handed wave that has become the symbol of the new party.</p> <p>Construction workers returned the waves. An army truck drove by and soldiers leaned out and gave the wave. Workers at The Herald gave the wave. The crowd roared in approval at these signs that even government employees support the opposition.</p> <p>The march swelled to 4,000. People sang and danced. 'This is the best of Zimbabwe,' said a white-haired black woman. 'Look at us. Black people, white people, everyone marching together for peace. If we stand together we can bring change to Zimbabwe.'</p> <p>The riot police were reduced to following the march.

Mugabe's Information Minister last week accused Hain of acting like 'the governor of Rhodesia' - the former colony that became Zimbabwe on independence in 1980. Analysts believe that Mugabe, 76, is trying to portray himself as a champion of black interests and paint the increasingly popular Movement for Democratic Change as stooges of Western, in particular British, interests. Britain will be urging a strong condemnation of the Zimbabwean government's actions at a summit meeting of European and African leaders in Cairo tomorrow, government sources said.",

      "bodyText": "The pro-blood sports lobby was last night dealt a devastating blow when Britain's leading expert on the countryside declared that virtually no jobs would be lost if the Government banned hunting with dogs. In an exclusive interview with The Observer, Sean Rickard, a former adviser to both Tory and Labour administrations, revealed that he could even foresee a net increase in jobs following a ban if the money spent on hunting is instead ploughed into other rural businesses. Rickard, who is also a former chief economist of the National Farmers Union, will tomorrow submit a report to the Government's Burns inquiry investigating the impact of a hunting ban. His report contradicts claims by the Countryside Alliance that up to 16,000 jobs could be lost in rural areas if Labour sticks to its manifesto commitment to outlaw hunting. 'It is abundantly clear that the claims by the Countryside Alliance are a gross exaggeration,' Rickard said last night. 'l believe we are talking about a possible short-term loss in the hundreds but in the medium term, say five years, it's likely that practically no jobs will have been lost at all.' Although Rickard's research was commissioned by the Campaign for the Protection of Hunted Animals - an umbrella group for the RSPCA, International Fund for Animal Welfare and the League against Cruel Sports - he has stressed his independence. 'I really don't mind if hunting is banned or not. I have no axe to grind on this issue and undertook the analysis as an independent academic economist,' he said. But Paul Latham, a spokesman for the Countryside Alliance, said: 'We will have to wait to see Rickard's full report before we can respond in full. But we are confident in the figures we have put forward relating to job losses. The assumptions he seems to make are from statistics I simply do not recognise.'

      "body": "<p>Michael Heseltine called it the prawn cocktail offensive but it was also a terrible time for chickens. </p> <p>Five years ago Labour and the Conservatives were slugging it out on the commerce dinner circuit, each trying to persuade business it had the answers to their problems. </p> <p>In Labour's case, conversations over the chicken fricassees and Kievs focused on nailing suspicions they would hike public spending and double corporation tax. They co-opted sympathetic figures from many businesses to the cause and policy documents explained how Labour would make a difference. And they reduced it all to five key pledges in a Business Manifesto. </p> <p>But has Labour delivered? Until recently the verdict from business has been good. But problems over the strength of the pound, the crisis in manufacturing, underinvestment in transport and business 'stealth taxes' suggest the party's business-friendly image is being tarnished. Last week the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce lashed out at Labour's record, and particularly the Budget, which he said neglected manufacturing, focused too much on public spending and contained complex tax changes and regulation which could end up harming businesses in the long run. </p> <p>The party will be working up its next package for an election widely predicted for next year. What should it include? The Observer contacted some key figures close, and not so close, to 'the project' to ask their views. </p> <p>Matthew Taylor, now director of the Institute of Public Policy Research, was one of those who drew up Labour's business manifesto for 1997. 'The real importance was getting business on side. But it's not just business votes - it impresses a single mother in Halifax to know that Labour was trusted by millionaire businessmen.' </p> <p>The key was the economy - exorcising the ghosts of past crises. The Government can claim that with the prospect of full employment, inflation under control, and a bumper budget surplus, it has delivered. </p> <p>Taylor gives Gordon Brown 9 out of 10 for economic management. Others have plenty of praise too. Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, says that thanks to Brown 'the stature of the UK has done nothing but increase over the last three years. A lot of this has to do with giving independence to the Bank of England.' </p> <p>But Jones, like others such as John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Unions Congress, say the high value of sterling - caused in part by the weak euro - has hammered manufacturers and taken the gloss off Brown's record. Monks says the vulnerability of manufacturing to this is seen in the Rover debacle. Nor does Jones like the 'camouflage taxes' on business introduced by Labour. </p> <p>In other key policy areas the judgment is less favourable. Business is suspicious of the new Competition Act, which brings in fines for anti-competitive practices. </p> <p>Following the success of Bank of England independence, plans were announced to remove the politics from takeovers. Yet, although Stephen Byers presses on with the policy, recent decisions - such as that to refer cable company NTL's bid for CWC (Cable &amp; Wireless Communications) to the Competition Commission - have increased, not diminished, controversy over government policy. </p> <p>The European record too, is mixed. In a 1996 policy document, Robin Cook said: 'We believe that putting Britain at the centre of Europe is what business in Britain generally wants.' But there is a distinct flavour of disappointment. </p> <p>Lord Haskins, Blair confidante, head of Northern Foods, and Government red-tape cutter says: 'They have not delivered for understandable reasons such as the strength of sterling. Until you join the currency you are always going to be semi-detached.' </p> <p>Monks says: 'Labour is a breath of fresh air. But I think Europeans get fed up with being lectured about the virtues of the British way.' </p> <p>There are signs the Government has lobbied on the right issues, for example Tony Blair's intervention in favour of Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann - seen as a test of the openness of corporate Europe. However, progress in other markets such as electricity is slower despite British exhortation. </p> <p>Nor is Europe the most highly criticised area. There may be the prospect of full employment in the UK but, as recent research has shown, the unemployed often do not have the skills to do available jobs. The Department of Trade and Industry published a survey of nine countries last year showing Britain ranking eighth on adult literacy and last in numeracy. </p> <p>After the election, the DTI published an audit of UK business which found patchy investment, particularly in manufacturing and R&amp;D. Nine companies provided a third of the UK total. </p> <p>Attempts to tackle these issues in a series of budgetary measures - tax breaks on share options for some employees and for R&amp;D in some companies - have been praised by some, but criticised as 'tinkering' by others, including the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies. </p> <p>Jones is positive about the New Deal, which attempts to bring the long-term unemployed into the Labour market by offering one of four training or educational options. However, research by the Liberal Democrats indicates the New Deal may not be as successful as believed - for example only 10.9 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds on the education option complete courses. </p> <p>But Matthew Taylor suspects he knows the reason for poor skills: 'The Government has relied on business voluntarily to provide new training. Business has been lacklustre.' </p> <p>Labour has also upset consumer groups. While Consumers' Association director Sheila McKechnie praises the Competition Act for shifting the balance of power against companies exploiting consumers, she thinks the Government has copped out in key areas. </p> <p>She is furious about Byers taking telecoms and water companies out of the consumer-focused Utilities Bill. 'Consumers will have to wait until the new parliament, if ever, to ensure that their voice is heard and their needs put at the heart of the regulatory process,' she says. </p> <p>She adds that the Government 'buckled and refused to regulate mortgage advice' having said it would, and that another of its policies - the Foods Standards Agency - does not reflect the interests of consumers on its board. </p> <p>Environmentalists, too, are less than happy. They believed the party's election manifesto pointed to the greening of government and business. Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth, says the results of three key government promises - to put the environment at the heart of government, environmental tax reform and creation of successful environmental businesses - have been mixed. Promotion of green technology and business - for example, creating solar and wind power industries - has been poor. </p> <p>The balance between the environment and business is only one of several tricks the Government has had to bring off. Another is keeping unions and business happy. </p> <p>The CBI claims, despite disagreeing with union recognition measures in the Employment Relations Act, that it has negotiated well for business. But the TUC says in its new manifesto submission that, despite progress, 'too often the Government has tilted towards employer opinion in determining the detail of the legislation and framing regulations'. So what should be the overall strategy? </p> <p>The TUC believes working-time regulations, parental leave and the regulations for upgrading the minimum wage should be rebalanced. With evidence of discontent among traditional Labour voters, Tony Blair cannot guarantee workers' votes. Digby Jones believes the Government has to act as an enabler, to allow business its full role in 'socially inclusive wealth creation'. </p> <p>Taylor agrees, but thinks business needs to be prodded. There are already signs of this - last year Byers delivered a stern lecture on poor training to the CBI annual conference. </p> <p>The unions, Taylor believes, have a role and Blair should be grateful for Monks, who is prepared to co-operate. So, the paradox this time round could be that Labour tells business what to do while wooing the unions. </p> <p>If that's the case, the chickens can relax. It'll be cheese and pickle on granary and a pint of beer instead. </p> <p><strong>The experts' view</strong></p> <p><strong> The Businessman:</strong> Chris Haskins <br> Chairman Northern Foods, head of Government's Better Regulation Taskforce </p> <p><strong>1 </strong>Continue to balance the books <br> <strong> 2</strong> Join the euro as early as is practicable, renew efforts for a central role in Europe<br> <strong> 3</strong> Raise teaching quality in secondary schools, and higher and further education<br> <strong> 4</strong> Focus activity on small businesses on those that have prospects of growing.

Lord Haskins, Blair confidante, head of Northern Foods, and Government red-tape cutter says: 'They have not delivered for understandable reasons such as the strength of sterling. Until you join the currency you are always going to be semi-detached.' Monks says: 'Labour is a breath of fresh air. But I think Europeans get fed up with being lectured about the virtues of the British way.' There are signs the Government has lobbied on the right issues, for example Tony Blair's intervention in favour of Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann - seen as a test of the openness of corporate Europe. However, progress in other markets such as electricity is slower despite British exhortation. Nor is Europe the most highly criticised area. There may be the prospect of full employment in the UK but, as recent research has shown, the unemployed often do not have the skills to do available jobs. The Department of Trade and Industry published a survey of nine countries last year showing Britain ranking eighth on adult literacy and last in numeracy. After the election, the DTI published an audit of UK business which found patchy investment, particularly in manufacturing and R&amp;D. Nine companies provided a third of the UK total. Attempts to tackle these issues in a series of budgetary measures - tax breaks on share options for some employees and for R&amp;D in some companies - have been praised by some, but criticised as 'tinkering' by others, including the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies. Jones is positive about the New Deal, which attempts to bring the long-term unemployed into the Labour market by offering one of four training or educational options. However, research by the Liberal Democrats indicates the New Deal may not be as successful as believed - for example only 10.9 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds on the education option complete courses. But Matthew Taylor suspects he knows the reason for poor skills: 'The Government has relied on business voluntarily to provide new training. Business has been lacklustre.' Labour has also upset consumer groups. While Consumers' Association director Sheila McKechnie praises the Competition Act for shifting the balance of power against companies exploiting consumers, she thinks the Government has copped out in key areas. She is furious about Byers taking telecoms and water companies out of the consumer-focused Utilities Bill. 'Consumers will have to wait until the new parliament, if ever, to ensure that their voice is heard and their needs put at the heart of the regulatory process,' she says. She adds that the Government 'buckled and refused to regulate mortgage advice' having said it would, and that another of its policies - the Foods Standards Agency - does not reflect the interests of consumers on its board. Environmentalists, too, are less than happy. They believed the party's election manifesto pointed to the greening of government and business. Charles Secrett, executive director of Friends of the Earth, says the results of three key government promises - to put the environment at the heart of government, environmental tax reform and creation of successful environmental businesses - have been mixed. Promotion of green technology and business - for example, creating solar and wind power industries - has been poor. The balance between the environment and business is only one of several tricks the Government has had to bring off. Another is keeping unions and business happy. The CBI claims, despite disagreeing with union recognition measures in the Employment Relations Act, that it has negotiated well for business. But the TUC says in its new manifesto submission that, despite progress, 'too often the Government has tilted towards employer opinion in determining the detail of the legislation and framing regulations'. So what should be the overall strategy? The TUC believes working-time regulations, parental leave and the regulations for upgrading the minimum wage should be rebalanced. With evidence of discontent among traditional Labour voters, Tony Blair cannot guarantee workers' votes. Digby Jones believes the Government has to act as an enabler, to allow business its full role in 'socially inclusive wealth creation'. Taylor agrees, but thinks business needs to be prodded. There are already signs of this - last year Byers delivered a stern lecture on poor training to the CBI annual conference. The unions, Taylor believes, have a role and Blair should be grateful for Monks, who is prepared to co-operate. So, the paradox this time round could be that Labour tells business what to do while wooing the unions. If that's the case, the chickens can relax. It'll be cheese and pickle on granary and a pint of beer instead.

Invited to put up another name instead, Hague's first reaction was to comply, with misgivings. At least two other possible names were mooted - one being Stanley Kalms, Tory boss of the Dixons chain.</p> <p>What triggered Hague's subsequent rage was not the decision itself, but the humiliating fact that it had leaked. He and his advisers have long suspected that there is collusion between Downing Street and the Times 's political staff. He accused Blair's advisers of being behind the latest leak, and demanded that the Prime Minister make amends by exercising his power to ignore the Scrutiny Committee and award Ashcroft a peerage anyway.</p> <p>A nonplussed Tony Blair replied that he could not intervene. He denied that his staff were behind the leak - as does the Times - and advised Hague to deal directly with the Scrutiny Committee.</p> <p>Today the Conservative leader will address the party faithful gathered in Harrogate, hoping to keep their minds on the political struggle ahead and not on the wreckage left by the saga of the newly ennobled Lord Ashcroft. The Tory leader fought with singular ferocity to secure a peerage for his party treasurer, leaving senior and respected members of his party, including two former Prime Ministers, seething at the way he has dragged himself into another unnecessary row on behalf of a rich businessman of questionable reputation.</p> <p>Following the rebuff from Blair, Hague's staff worked on a possible compromise deal with the Scrutiny Committee. The committee - made up of the former Foreign Secretary Lord Hurd, former print union leader Baroness Dean, and the Liberal Democrat Lord Thomson of Monifeith - met last Tuesday and were presented with two new offers from Ashcroft, forwarded through Hague's office. Ashcroft was now giving a deadline by which he promised to repatriate himself to the UK, and he let the committee know that he was resigning as Belize's envoy to the UN, effective from that day.</p> <p>It is possible that if Ashcroft's nomination had been delayed another year - by which time he would presumably have demonstrated the seriousness of his intention to return to the UK - it could have gone through with a minimum of fuss. Hague's peculiar sense of timing, in insisting that Ashcroft must have his new handle this week, risked casting a pall over the Harrogate spring conference, the second most important event in the Tory party's annual calendar.</p> <p>While Hague's staff suspect that Downing Street and the Labour Party are responsible for whipping up a furore over Ashcroft's peerage, they say that much of it is instigated by his own side.</p> <p>A key figure is thought to be George Bridges, a leader writer for the Times who played a part in that newspaper's relentless pursuit of Ashcroft, which almost set off what could have been one of the most expensive libel cases in British legal history. Bridges is a former aide of John Major, who is privately appalled by the Hague-Ashcroft link. When he was party leader, he warned against relying on Ashcroft as a source of substantial party funds.</p> <p>Bridges also steps out with the daughter of Tory grandee Viscount Cranborne, whom Hague sacked as Tory leader in the Lords. Last week, Cranborne attacked the decision to award Ashcroft a peerage as 'an affront to the dignity' of Parliament.</p> <p>His words were echoed by another former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, who said: 'The whole situation is deplorable, a disgrace.'</p> <p>There are many Tories - including Hague's putative successor Michael Portillo - who believe it was their reputation for sleaze which cost them the last election. Now Hague has gone and stirred up the pot of sleaze again.</p> <p>His obstinacy drew public attention away from Tony Blair's role as the Prime Minister who has appointed more peers in two years than Margaret Thatcher did in a decade. More than half of 209 peers appointed by Blair are Labour.</p> <p>Serious argument about the patronage system is hardly heard in the noise generated by Hague's support for Michael Ashcroft, leaving bemused observers to wonder why he was so obstinate. Labour MP Peter Bradley, who has watched the saga closely, believes that the simple answer is money. The Tory party has been desperately hard-up since its 1997 defeat. All that has stood between Conservative Central Office and financial disaster has been the energy and generosity of Michael Ashcroft, who donates more than \u00a31 million a year from his own fortune, and keeps a grip on the books. 'In nominating Ashcroft for a peerage William Hague has chosen political bankruptcy for the Conservative Party over financial bankruptcy,' Bradley claimed.</p> <p>Defending Ashcroft's peerage yesterday, party chairman Michael Ancram said: 'Michael Ashcroft has made us live within our means, made us cut our expenditure, made us do the things that we needed to do, and I'm delighted he has his peerage.'</p>",

He and his advisers have long suspected that there is collusion between Downing Street and the Times 's political staff. He accused Blair's advisers of being behind the latest leak, and demanded that the Prime Minister make amends by exercising his power to ignore the Scrutiny Committee and award Ashcroft a peerage anyway. A nonplussed Tony Blair replied that he could not intervene. He denied that his staff were behind the leak - as does the Times - and advised Hague to deal directly with the Scrutiny Committee. Today the Conservative leader will address the party faithful gathered in Harrogate, hoping to keep their minds on the political struggle ahead and not on the wreckage left by the saga of the newly ennobled Lord Ashcroft. The Tory leader fought with singular ferocity to secure a peerage for his party treasurer, leaving senior and respected members of his party, including two former Prime Ministers, seething at the way he has dragged himself into another unnecessary row on behalf of a rich businessman of questionable reputation. Following the rebuff from Blair, Hague's staff worked on a possible compromise deal with the Scrutiny Committee. The committee - made up of the former Foreign Secretary Lord Hurd, former print union leader Baroness Dean, and the Liberal Democrat Lord Thomson of Monifeith - met last Tuesday and were presented with two new offers from Ashcroft, forwarded through Hague's office. Ashcroft was now giving a deadline by which he promised to repatriate himself to the UK, and he let the committee know that he was resigning as Belize's envoy to the UN, effective from that day. It is possible that if Ashcroft's nomination had been delayed another year - by which time he would presumably have demonstrated the seriousness of his intention to return to the UK - it could have gone through with a minimum of fuss. Hague's peculiar sense of timing, in insisting that Ashcroft must have his new handle this week, risked casting a pall over the Harrogate spring conference, the second most important event in the Tory party's annual calendar. While Hague's staff suspect that Downing Street and the Labour Party are responsible for whipping up a furore over Ashcroft's peerage, they say that much of it is instigated by his own side. A key figure is thought to be George Bridges, a leader writer for the Times who played a part in that newspaper's relentless pursuit of Ashcroft, which almost set off what could have been one of the most expensive libel cases in British legal history. Bridges is a former aide of John Major, who is privately appalled by the Hague-Ashcroft link. When he was party leader, he warned against relying on Ashcroft as a source of substantial party funds. Bridges also steps out with the daughter of Tory grandee Viscount Cranborne, whom Hague sacked as Tory leader in the Lords. Last week, Cranborne attacked the decision to award Ashcroft a peerage as 'an affront to the dignity' of Parliament. His words were echoed by another former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, who said: 'The whole situation is deplorable, a disgrace.' There are many Tories - including Hague's putative successor Michael Portillo - who believe it was their reputation for sleaze which cost them the last election. Now Hague has gone and stirred up the pot of sleaze again. His obstinacy drew public attention away from Tony Blair's role as the Prime Minister who has appointed more peers in two years than Margaret Thatcher did in a decade. More than half of 209 peers appointed by Blair are Labour. Serious argument about the patronage system is hardly heard in the noise generated by Hague's support for Michael Ashcroft, leaving bemused observers to wonder why he was so obstinate. Labour MP Peter Bradley, who has watched the saga closely, believes that the simple answer is money. The Tory party has been desperately hard-up since its 1997 defeat. All that has stood between Conservative Central Office and financial disaster has been the energy and generosity of Michael Ashcroft, who donates more than \u00a31 million a year from his own fortune, and keeps a grip on the books. 'In nominating Ashcroft for a peerage William Hague has chosen political bankruptcy for the Conservative Party over financial bankruptcy,' Bradley claimed. Defending Ashcroft's peerage yesterday, party chairman Michael Ancram said: 'Michael Ashcroft has made us live within our means, made us cut our expenditure, made us do the things that we needed to do, and I'm delighted he has his peerage.'",

Demon's settlement, goes one argument, particularly in America, means the Net's famous freedom of speech has gone. ISPs will be scared off running contentious comments; conversations will become anodyne. </p> <p>'Nonsense. Absolute nonsense,' says Godfrey, a quiet and pleasant talker, sitting opposite me in a greasy spoon in Stanmore, a tired, pedantic, not unkind man. 'Look... I don't think society would be greatly harmed if a lot of people making untrue and malicious allegations were prevented from doing so. The difference is that I had asked them, three times, to remove this stuff, and they hadn't done so. And all that has happened with this judgment - it's the same as is the case just now, with bookshops, or newsagents: carrying something offensive is fine while they're innocent of it, but once alerted to the fact they must remove it.' </p> <p>Did he regret the Net's existence? Regret all those postings? 'Now, yes, of course I do. This has been an incredible strain on me and my family. But... I suppose I feel, sometimes, I do have to fight against injustice where I see it.

      "body": "<p>For devotees of the Scottish mountains, Easter 2000 is shaping up as a classic. After a patchy winter, an Arctic weather front will slide over the Highlands this week, bringing the promise of heavy snow and a few more days of pristine winter conditions at the end of the skiing season.</p> <p>But experienced avalanche experts and climbing guides fear this year will be remembered for less welcome reasons. There is increasing disquiet over a new system for forecasting avalanches, with fears it could put lives at risk by cutting costs.</p> <p>From today, the conventional method of using qualified specialists to gather local snowpack and weather data will be replaced by a system that relies on a computer model designed only as an aid for professional forecasters.</p> <p>Critics believe the model, developed in Switzerland and known as NXD, cannot cope with the unpredictable weather of the Scottish mountains.</p> <p>Tom Rupar, one of Britain's most highly qualified forecasters, told The Observer: 'There is a determination to use computer forecasting irrespective of whether it works or not. Its use in the Scottish context is fraught with inaccuracy, almost certainly because of the fickleness of the climate.'</p> <p>NXD uses 'nearest neighbour analysis' to predict the likelihood of an avalanche by checking weather and snow conditions against those in which slides have occurred in the past. A modified version has been in use since 1991, but never as the cornerstone of the system.</p> <p>Its newly elevated status comes after the avalanche information service was put out to tender by its operator, Sport Scotland. The contract was won by Blyth Wright, who had run the service as a salaried consultant to the quango.</p> <p>Critics fear his company's cut-price bid, believed to be around \u00a3100,000, makes it impossible for forecasting standards to be maintained through the winter. Tom Rupar and his business partner bid \u00a3150,000 for the contract, an amount they claim would cover the cost of running the service properly.</p> <p>Under the contract, the service has to cover a minimum of 136 days, with provision for an extra 21 should conditions dictate. Wright, however, employed full-time forecasters, at a daily rate of \u00a3120 each, in the five areas for only 102 days.</p> <p>For the remainder, Wright, working from his base at Sport Scotland's Glenmore Lodge in the Cairngorms, will produce forecasts using a combination of Met Office forecasts and field observations supplied by a network of local contacts.</p> <p>Detailed forecasts for the five main areas will be replaced by a single, general forecast for the entire Highlands each day.</p> <p>'The avalanche service has a duty of care to mountain users and by using this system it is riding roughshod over that,' said Rupar, a former northern Cairngorm forecaster. 'The fact is they can't afford \u00a3700 a day to have five guys testing the snow and that is just wrong. My worry is that it will take a serious accident to make people wake up to that.'</p> <p>In January last year two students, part of a group being led by an experienced guide, were killed by a slide in the Nevis range. Such serious incidents have been relatively rare in Scotland, but the quality of forecasting is now more important than ever for a new breed of inexperienced enthusiasts who travel to potentially lethal areas with the help of hi-tech equipment.</p> <p>Last week, Wright admitted financial constraints had forced the introduction of the scaled-down system, but dismissed safety concerns as a malicious 'theological' row stoked up by the losing bidders for the contract.</p> <p>'Budgets are tight and they ought to be tight. Avalanches have been recorded as late as June but there have been only four fatalities in April since 1950. To have observers on the hill all that time would be preposterous. We are quite convinced we are making provision appropriate to the level of risk.'</p> <p>Specialists in forecasting have to get into some of the most inhospitable areas every day to test snow conditions by digging deep pits and examining the layers of snow as well as the make-up of the crystals. They set off slides to test a slope's stability.</p> <p>Guidelines drawn up by Wright and detailed in an unpublished report of the Scottish Avalanche Review Group say 'information from the routine triggering or attempted triggering of avalanches on representative slopes is an essential input into the NXD model. Contractors are required to carry out such tests daily.' But Wright, who claims an 84 per cent accuracy rate for the new system, insisted it could function without daily field data gathered by specialists, such as snow temperatures, drift patterns and the relative weaknesses of individual layers.</p> <p>He said: 'The consensus in Europe is that many of the snowpack variables are not necessary. Through my extensive network of contacts, I'm confident we will get all the information we need.'</p> <p>Tim Walker, principal of Glenmore Lodge and Sport Scotland's avalanche project manager, defended the new arrangements. 'We have been developing this for over a year. Its accuracy is tried and tested and is at least as good as that of human forecasters. We are delighted the savings have made it possible for us to extend to the end of the winter a service previously available for only three or four months a year.'</p> <p>But experienced mountain users such as Alasdair Cain, a professional guide and former senior forecaster for the Nevis range, have little confidence in these assurances. 'Blyth must have a crystal ball if he thinks this will work. Avalanche forecasting is one thing in Europe but in Scotland we are dealing with so many microclimates.

      "bodyText": "For devotees of the Scottish mountains, Easter 2000 is shaping up as a classic. After a patchy winter, an Arctic weather front will slide over the Highlands this week, bringing the promise of heavy snow and a few more days of pristine winter conditions at the end of the skiing season. But experienced avalanche experts and climbing guides fear this year will be remembered for less welcome reasons. There is increasing disquiet over a new system for forecasting avalanches, with fears it could put lives at risk by cutting costs. From today, the conventional method of using qualified specialists to gather local snowpack and weather data will be replaced by a system that relies on a computer model designed only as an aid for professional forecasters. Critics believe the model, developed in Switzerland and known as NXD, cannot cope with the unpredictable weather of the Scottish mountains. Tom Rupar, one of Britain's most highly qualified forecasters, told The Observer: 'There is a determination to use computer forecasting irrespective of whether it works or not. Its use in the Scottish context is fraught with inaccuracy, almost certainly because of the fickleness of the climate.' NXD uses 'nearest neighbour analysis' to predict the likelihood of an avalanche by checking weather and snow conditions against those in which slides have occurred in the past. A modified version has been in use since 1991, but never as the cornerstone of the system. Its newly elevated status comes after the avalanche information service was put out to tender by its operator, Sport Scotland. The contract was won by Blyth Wright, who had run the service as a salaried consultant to the quango. Critics fear his company's cut-price bid, believed to be around \u00a3100,000, makes it impossible for forecasting standards to be maintained through the winter. Tom Rupar and his business partner bid \u00a3150,000 for the contract, an amount they claim would cover the cost of running the service properly. Under the contract, the service has to cover a minimum of 136 days, with provision for an extra 21 should conditions dictate. Wright, however, employed full-time forecasters, at a daily rate of \u00a3120 each, in the five areas for only 102 days. For the remainder, Wright, working from his base at Sport Scotland's Glenmore Lodge in the Cairngorms, will produce forecasts using a combination of Met Office forecasts and field observations supplied by a network of local contacts. Detailed forecasts for the five main areas will be replaced by a single, general forecast for the entire Highlands each day. 'The avalanche service has a duty of care to mountain users and by using this system it is riding roughshod over that,' said Rupar, a former northern Cairngorm forecaster. 'The fact is they can't afford \u00a3700 a day to have five guys testing the snow and that is just wrong. My worry is that it will take a serious accident to make people wake up to that.' In January last year two students, part of a group being led by an experienced guide, were killed by a slide in the Nevis range. Such serious incidents have been relatively rare in Scotland, but the quality of forecasting is now more important than ever for a new breed of inexperienced enthusiasts who travel to potentially lethal areas with the help of hi-tech equipment. Last week, Wright admitted financial constraints had forced the introduction of the scaled-down system, but dismissed safety concerns as a malicious 'theological' row stoked up by the losing bidders for the contract. 'Budgets are tight and they ought to be tight. Avalanches have been recorded as late as June but there have been only four fatalities in April since 1950. To have observers on the hill all that time would be preposterous. We are quite convinced we are making provision appropriate to the level of risk.' Specialists in forecasting have to get into some of the most inhospitable areas every day to test snow conditions by digging deep pits and examining the layers of snow as well as the make-up of the crystals. They set off slides to test a slope's stability. Guidelines drawn up by Wright and detailed in an unpublished report of the Scottish Avalanche Review Group say 'information from the routine triggering or attempted triggering of avalanches on representative slopes is an essential input into the NXD model. Contractors are required to carry out such tests daily.' But Wright, who claims an 84 per cent accuracy rate for the new system, insisted it could function without daily field data gathered by specialists, such as snow temperatures, drift patterns and the relative weaknesses of individual layers. He said: 'The consensus in Europe is that many of the snowpack variables are not necessary. Through my extensive network of contacts, I'm confident we will get all the information we need.' Tim Walker, principal of Glenmore Lodge and Sport Scotland's avalanche project manager, defended the new arrangements. 'We have been developing this for over a year. Its accuracy is tried and tested and is at least as good as that of human forecasters. We are delighted the savings have made it possible for us to extend to the end of the winter a service previously available for only three or four months a year.' But experienced mountain users such as Alasdair Cain, a professional guide and former senior forecaster for the Nevis range, have little confidence in these assurances. 'Blyth must have a crystal ball if he thinks this will work. Avalanche forecasting is one thing in Europe but in Scotland we are dealing with so many microclimates. There is no way a computer can allow for that.' Ron Walker, who runs the Talisman guiding operation in the Cairngorms, agreed. 'A lot of people rely on the forecasts because they don't have the knowledge to assess the risk for themselves. They must be accurate, and I can't see how they can be without guys out there digging pits and checking the snow.'",

'The truth was, though, that I was terribly lonely. I'd log on to find answers to questions that had intrigued me for years.</p> <p>'I believe it was far from chance that I met Nik.

He lived where the sun shone year round. It sounded idyllic. I just fell helplessly in love with someone I have never seen, let alone met.'</p> <p>A warning sign came when she asked Nik for his phone number; he refused. The next time they chatted over the Internet, Nik confessed that business was going badly and he was behind with payments on his van and equipment.</p> <p>'I found myself begging for him to accept money from me,' Linda said. 'I sent the first \u00a31,500 to a PO box in Orlando. Then he said his problems were greater than he had realised. He was in really serious financial trouble and he was fighting to keep things going.'</p> <p>Nik told her he needed \u00a310,000 by the end of the month to settle final payments.

Both men and women looking for romance are being 'charmed' by cyber-conmen into making 'loans' in return for the prospect of love. In the latest case, Linda, a 47-year-old mother-of-two from Warwickshire, has sought counselling after losing a five-figure sum. Linda, who had been married for 22 years, told The Observer how she was so convinced by the man she knew as Nik that she would have left everything for him. 'I had a husband, two bubbly teenagers, a lovely home, my own car and was able to afford most things I wanted,' she said. 'The truth was, though, that I was terribly lonely. I'd log on to find answers to questions that had intrigued me for years. 'I believe it was far from chance that I met Nik. We began \"chatting\" and I was soon pouring out my heart to him about my life, my problems and dreams. 'He had told me his wife ran off, leaving him to run his little landscape gardening business in Florida. He lived where the sun shone year round. It sounded idyllic. I just fell helplessly in love with someone I have never seen, let alone met.' A warning sign came when she asked Nik for his phone number; he refused. The next time they chatted over the Internet, Nik confessed that business was going badly and he was behind with payments on his van and equipment. 'I found myself begging for him to accept money from me,' Linda said. 'I sent the first \u00a31,500 to a PO box in Orlando. Then he said his problems were greater than he had realised. He was in really serious financial trouble and he was fighting to keep things going.' Nik told her he needed \u00a310,000 by the end of the month to settle final payments. But Linda's daughter warned her it was a con and she pulled out, never to hear from Nik again. Protected by the anonymity of a computer screen, no one needs to be especially charming or good-looking. Like Linda, Ian McLean was about to leave everything he had for an Internet lover. The 33-year-old married promotions executive from Paisley was told by 'Lori' that she wanted to escape a violent marriage to be with him. He began spending up to four hours a day online to Lori. His wife Kristeen left him in despair. He cashed in his savings, sold his furniture and bought a flight out to the US, plus a \u00a33,000 engagement ring, before he discovered that Lori was really Lisa Thompson, a grey-haired mother-of-three. 'I must be the most naive man in the world,' McLean said. 'I gave up everything for her and lost everything. I still can't get my head round it.' Michael Banks, a psychologist who studies romantic Internet stings, said: 'One common ploy is that [the conman] will say \"I'm dying to meet you but I don't have the money for airfare.\" The cash is forwarded to a box number and, goodness, you just never hear from that person.' Ruth Dickson, of the watchdog Internet Watch Foundation, said people should be on their guard. 'We would advise people to exercise caution. Anyone can pretend to be anyone they want on the Internet.' The most extreme case of Internet love gone wrong must be Trevor Tasker, 27, who spent a large chunk of his savings last year to fly to America to meet the gorgeous woman of his dreams. He found a 20-stone pensioner who was promptly arrested by police over a dead body in her freezer. He vowed: 'I'll never log on again.' tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

This is despite public pledges by the firm, Astra-Zeneca, that it had stopped working on terminator projects several years ago. Terminator technology makes crops produce sterile seeds, thus forcing farmers to buy new seeds each year from the biotech firms instead of collecting them free from their harvest as they currently do.

In Britain, the biotech giant Astra-Zeneca also wrote to aid agencies and the United Nations saying it was 'one piece of technology we did not want to take forward and the project was stopped in 1992'.

The company - ExSeed Genetics - explicity states on its patent how its new discovery will stop farmers from saving seeds from their harvest, a practice that has gone on for some 10,000 years and accounts for 70 per cent of all seed used by farmers worldwide.

But that is where the bomb came from, that is where the main people behind the atrocity are based,' he said.</p> <p>Victor Barker, an English lawyer moved with his family to Buncrana, Co Donegal, to escape the rat race in Britain. Barker's 12-year-old son James was killed by the bomb. He also accepts that those behind the atrocity will probably escape justice.

Some of those who have not been arrested in connection with Omagh also have children and yet they can divorce their private lives from their so-called war, a war in which innocent men, women and even children are killed.

      "bodyText": "Twenty months after the worst mass murder in British criminal history, detectives investigating the Omagh bomb atrocity have privately conceded they stand no chance of bringing the guilty to justice - even though they know the names of those responsible and every detail of how the bombing was carried out. Following a huge manhunt, RUC detectives have identified the members of the Real IRA gang who constructed, transported and detonated the bomb, which killed 29 people and two unborn children in the Co Tyrone town 20 months ago. The names of the chief suspects, who include two women, one of whom is a relative of a Provisional IRA man killed by the security forces, have been shown to The Observer . They also include a South Armagh man who constructed the bomb, and three brothers from Co Monaghan who transported the device across the border on 15 August, 1998. Yet, although the RUC and the Gardai have built up a portrait of the core gang of around 30 Real IRA members and supporters involved in the plot, officers say there is little chance of conviction. The inquiry team scanned 500 million mobile and landline phone calls made in Ireland, North and South, before, during and after the Omagh bombing. The team connected calls made from Real IRA leaders in the Dundalk/North Louth area to members of the terror group in Omagh on the day of the massacre. But, as one senior RUC officer said last week, there seems little hope of convicting any of the main players 'unless one of them gets a pang of conscience and there is a road to Damascus conversion'. The RUC and Gardai concentrated on several Real IRA members they believed initially might prove to be weak links in the organisation. A look, however, at the behaviour of some of those under scrutiny shows the Real IRA to be a disciplined terrorist organisation with members trained to resist interrogation techniques. The bomb-maker comes from South Armagh but lives south of the border near Dundalk. The RUC and Gardai know now that, when news broke that scores of civilians had been killed at Omagh, the bomb-maker went straight to a bar in central Dundalk frequented by Real IRA members. As reports came in on the mounting death toll, the man 'drank himself into a stupor'. The Real IRA engineer, a former Provisional IRA veteran who constructed most of the large bombs for the Provos' South Armagh Brigade before the 1997 split within the mainstream republican movement, has been drinking heavily ever since. It was this man who test-fired explosives of the type used at Omagh on a mountainside above Omeath, a seaside town in Co Louth, a fortnight before the atrocity. 'This man has basically become an alcoholic since Omagh, but when our colleagues in the Garda hauled him in for questioning the guy hardly asked to go to the toilet. He simply said nothing and was able to walk free,' a senior RUC detective said. Another supposed 'weak link in the Real IRA chain' was three brothers living in a village in Monaghan, close to the border. The brothers are known to be educationally sub-normal but they too failed to break their silence during interrogation. The two women involved in the plot include a member of a republican family from Co Armagh and a Dundalk-based Provisional IRA veteran whom the RUC said is 'vastly experienced in terrorism'. Both forces know the bomb was mixed on a farm near Trim, Co Meath, and brought to the Monaghan family's home before being taken into Northern Ireland. The farm belongs to a former long-standing Provisional IRA supporter. Detectives are also aware that the man who drove the bomb into Omagh came from Lurgan, Co Armagh. At least three key suspects have disappeared in recent months. One RUC detective admitted: 'We simply don't know where they are.' Last month the head of the Irish police, Garda Commissioner Pat Byrne, caused a storm by admitting it was highly unlikely that the Omagh bombers would ever be caught. Although his counterpart, RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, refuses to echo this gloomy assessment, his officers at the sharp end of the inquiry accept that Byrne was probably correct. 'The inquiry is still active, but perhaps Pat Byrne was just being honest,' a senior RUC oficer said. 'As a force, we will not say what he said in such a public official fashion but unless there is some Damascene conversion somewhere, they [the Real IRA] have beat it.' The RUC is disillusioned at the attitude of the British and Irish governments, who promised to hunt down the Omagh bombers and put them in prison. The two police forces wanted powers similar to those given to the Gardai investigating the murder of Dublin journalist Veronica Guerin by drug dealers. In that inquiry the Irish State used 'accomplice evidence' or 'supergrasses', who were prepared to give evidence against former criminal colleagues in return for immunity from prosecution and protection against retaliation. The use of such witnesses proved invaluable in the conviction of Paul Ward and Brian Meehan, the two Dublin criminals found guilty of murdering Guerin. It is understood, however that the Irish government in particular resisted calls for similar powers because of Sinn Fein's opposition to the use of supergrasses. RUC officers also found it frustrating that because the two forces operate in different jurisdictions, the conflicting laws on evidence, for example, meant that the Gardai could not use information and evidence gleaned by the police in Northern Ireland in the Republic. It is understood the failures of the Omagh investigation are to become a case study in the new programme to harmonise cross-border police inquiries as envisaged in the Patten Report. One of Chris Patten's central recommendations on RUC reform was for a new framework to improve joint police operations on the island. As one senior RUC officer put it: 'Omagh will be a template, a model on the failures of cross-border policing and how we can learn from the mistakes and weaknesses of that investigation for the future.' Many of the relatives of the 29 men, women and children who died in the explosion also accept there is little chance of the perpetrators being brought to justice. Michael Gallagher's 21-year-old son Adrian died in the explosion. He had been in Omagh town centre on that fateful Saturday afternoon to buy himself a new pair of boots and jeans. It took Gallagher 20 hours to find his son, whose body was taken to a makeshift mortuary at a nearby British Army base outside the town. Gallagher is disgusted but not surprised by the news that even RUC detectives at the centre of the inquiry are los ing hope. 'I don't blame the police at all for this, the truth is the officers were not given the tools to help them do the job.' He is scathing in criticism of the Irish government, particularly remarks by Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, who has called for widescale demilitarisation on the North Louth/South Armagh border. 'We had demilitarisation in the Omagh area before the atrocity. Six hundred soldiers were returned to barracks in Omagh. They were taken off the streets, and yet if soldiers had been able to accompany the small number of police officers in Omagh on the day of the bomb, they would have been able to clear the area in time. 'A bomb warning was given and with troops on the ground the area could have been cleared and lives saved. And they want demilitarisation in South Armagh now? But that is where the bomb came from, that is where the main people behind the atrocity are based,' he said. Victor Barker, an English lawyer moved with his family to Buncrana, Co Donegal, to escape the rat race in Britain. Barker's 12-year-old son James was killed by the bomb. He also accepts that those behind the atrocity will probably escape justice. Barker had considered confronting Real IRA leaders in Dundalk following the atrocity. The RUC warned him that his life would be in danger if he went with the media to face suspects. 'Like all the other families, my wife and I are extremely despondent, but it does not come as any surprise to us that these people have got away with it,' he said. 'The two governments, but particularly the British Government, are appeasing these people all the time. 'The only man charged with the crime, Colm Murphy, has dissolved his assets and ensured that his three children are looked after financially. Some of those who have not been arrested in connection with Omagh also have children and yet they can divorce their private lives from their so-called war, a war in which innocent men, women and even children are killed. And still they can love their own children when someone like my son is killed by them.'",

It is also useful if you are an extremely rich man or - note the language - a High Net Worth Individual.</p> <p>The shell-company system is also useful if you are called Pablo Escobar.

The Honourable Derek Taylor, the First Minister of the Island. Mrs Governor.</p> <p>She is trading in the TCI for the Heaven on Earth that is Surrey. She will leave behind a small battery of servants working, after a fashion, for her in the official residence, Waterloo, and, out in the grounds, legions of chaps wearing dun-coloured T-shirts emblazoned with the letters HMP. Prisoners, gardeners for the use of. Not all of them are murderers; some are from the island of Montserrat, which has lost its prison to the volcano. I twit Mrs Governor on whether she won't miss her murderer gardeners.</p> <p>She delivers her riposte with a hint of Cheam: 'They helped keep my cannons shiny.' She went on: 'I've got used to being surrounded by murderers and crooks. When they are in prison not surrounded by drink or drugs, they are delightful people.'</p> <p>I look around for Reg, but he wasn't there.</p> <p>The Reverend Grund and his friends are Bible-thumping holy rollers from Florida and they're here on a mission. They want to talk to Reg. As well as selling shell companies, Reg was their accountant. They say he's gone off with $5 million in cash and stocks, the seed-corn money for the Grand Turk Harbour Bay Project, a $150m development for the islands' capital: a marina, condos, a cinema and - Praise Be! - a centre for prayer. It sounds like a holy theme park, a place you could call HallelujahLand. With no Reg, HallelujahLand is sunk. Reg isn't around to defend himself.</p> <p>But first, the Reverend Grund must renounce Satan. His ponytail sways softly in the breeze and his mirror shades reflect the electric blue of the deep trench off Grand Turk, where whales lark and divers lurk.</p> <p>'Father, I repent.'</p> <p>His voice catches in a sob of despair. Before becoming a man of the cloth, he was an extra in Miami Vice. We bow our heads as the reverend prays on. 'Father, I repent for our past leadership...' Just for the hell of it, I ask the reverend where the founding father of HallelujahLand, Warren Johnson, is now. The reverend replies: 'Mr Johnson is currently in a federal facility in Central Florida pending his appeal.'</p> <p>Warren Johnson is doing an eight-year stretch for bankruptcy fraud. And the man who gave evidence against him?</p> <p>One Reg Bodhanya.</p> <p>The reverend is keen to prove that HallelujahLand is a worthy project. He leads the way down from Ebenezer Rock to a large concrete warehouse. In it are the goods the pioneers had bought for the project. The warehouse is opened and the reverend exclaims: 'Oh my goodness! Holy smoke! This place was packed. This was wall-to-wall lino, wood, toilets and concrete.'</p> <p>Satan has struck HallelujahLand not once, but twice. The Devil takes the hindmost. And their toilets. But still no word of the missing accountant.</p> <p>I ask the reverend where Reg is.</p> <p>He replies: 'On the street, there are dramatic rumours Mr Bodhanya may have been doing business with some of the wrong people and brought too much attention to himself and is no longer with us. But I personally wouldn't wish that upon him.'</p> <p>Amen to that.</p> <p>Should the British close down the tax haven? Boo-hoo, says the Honourable Ossie Skippings, quondam First Minister.

I put it to him that police officers in places like Britain and Canada say that behind the blue door is a whole bunch of crooks.</p> <p>Skippings replies: 'The answer to that is that we do have bank secrecy laws and everybody can be labelled a crook, but you're innocent until you're found guilty.'</p> <p>A cynic might say if you don't have the money to paint the office over there properly, then how can you possibly stand guard against organised crime and dirty money which runs to millions and millions of pounds?</p> <p>'No, it's not that we don't have the money to paint the office. It's just, um, bureaucracy. I mean, the person who's responsible is probably a few months late in getting the office painted.'</p> <p>Mr Skippings was once the subject of a somewhat unflattering 1986 Commission of Inquiry report - not into financial services - but arson on the islands, written by Louis Blom-Cooper. The report said of Skippings that any reading of a transcription of a taped phone conversation he made 'casts a chill over any democrat... he must experience the consequences of his intolerable conduct. He should be disqualified from holding public office.'</p> <p>Needless to say, he still occupies one. He's the minister of tourism.</p> <p>Boo-hoo, says the Honourable Norman Saunders, another quondam First Minister. We are doing our best to be respectable, he says.</p> <p>Where is Reg? I ask.</p> <p>'Don't know but if he has gone and done something wrong... occasionally these things creep up even in the UK.' He hadn't heard 'that Reg had been iced'. Fair enough.</p> <p>The Honourable Norman has a bit of form. In the Eighties, he was among Caribbean leaders helping the US fight drug crime. With tourism yet to take off, the place was awash with cocaine. In 1985, the then governor authorised wire taps... and, oh dear, oh dear, look who they caught. Step, sorry, crouch forward in FBI chains, the Honourable Norman.</p> <p>Today, he makes light of the little problem: 'I had difficulties under the Travel Act in the US. It's not a crime here.'</p> <p>It wasn't for a broken brake light. He was jailed for eight years for offering Colombians the use of the islands as a stopover on drug flights, a kind of Watford Gap for the Cali cartel.</p> <p>What was it like inside? 'Not too bad. They put me in a prison camp.'</p> <p>Now he's out and back in Parliament, the Honourable Norman once more.</p> <p>Boo-hoo, says Paul de Weerd. De Weerd by name, financial regulator by nature. He's the extremely nice chap sent in by London to tidy up the funny-money game. His office is in the same complex as the blue door and the buildings dying for want of paint. Funnily enough, he wants to be interviewed in the headquarters of a fancy law firm on Provo, the richer island where the tourists go. The law firm can afford paint. De Weerd goes on to say that the TCI now has the same laws and and the same standards as the UK. Suspicious money movements have to be reported. He's brought in more rules and regs - not Reg's.</p> <p>But how can the Turks have the same standards as the UK? Let's look at some of the people on the legislative council to which he reports. One is the Honourable Norman Saunders. De Weerd grins: 'Glad you brought that up. That happened 15 years ago and throws into vivid relief the way in which the TCI has progressed.' So is the Honourable Norman still in Parliament? How many British MPs have been done for drug trafficking offences and are still British MPs?</p> <p>'I have no idea,' says de Weerd.</p> <p>None of the small-time players on the TCI cuts the mustard with the likes of Gordon Brown, Tony Blair or William Hague. And the American public is getting irritated with Her Majesty's Caribbean tax havens. But Rupert Murdoch, Richard Branson and Conservative Party Treasurer Michael 'Lord' Ashcroft do have real clout. They use tax havens legally for their legitimate business purposes.</p> <p>Murdoch's companies use the Cayman Islands. Branson, the Virgin tycoon, uses the BVI, and Lord (pending) A owns a house, a school and a bank on the TCI - the Belize Bank. The big fear in the Treasury and the Foreign Office is that the likes of Murdoch, Branson, Ashcroft and a shoal of very rich people you've never heard of won't end up paying more tax if you close down the British colony tax havens. They'll just move their money somewhere even less well known. It's not noble, fair or just, but, as Scott Fitzgerald wrote, the rich are different.</p> <p>He's right. They pay less tax.</p> <p>There is one final thing to see on the Turks and Caicos. The enthronement of the new governor, Mervyn Jones. While we wait for Jones to turn up, the TCI police band, togged up in tropical whites, play 'The Green, Green Grass of Home'. Jones is a Welshman. Police Chief Turnham wanders around, also in whites. With a whoosh of excitement, the gubernatorial Rover turns up and out he pops. Jones turns out to a silver-haired chap with a fine moustache last seen on Squadron-Leader Biggles of the RFC. There is only problem with becoming His Excellency, the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands - you have to wear a dead ostrich's bottom on your head.</p> <p>And covered by the world's silliest hat? A fading memory of Empire, a bunch of self-serving quack politicians and the shell-company system, whereby very rich people (who have made their money legitimately) and very crooked people (not so) can hide their money from the open society. The man with the silly hat on his head may look a fool, but we, the British taxpayers, pay for the hat and all that is hidden underneath it. More fool us.</p> <p>Eh, Reg?</p> <p>\u0095 Looking For Reg, reported by John Sweeney and produced by Sandy Smith, Saturday, 15 April, Correspondent, BBC2, at 6.50pm</p>",

Such is the mercurial sphere of business sponsorship. Companies attach their names to artistic enterprises, get bored or fall on hard times, pull out and the projects fold.</p> <p>In rare cases, the relationship is faithful and astonishingly fruitful. British musical life has enjoyed three happy marriages in different areas. Lloyds Bank supported a generation of young school-aged soloists through BBC Young Musician of the Year (sadly abandoned since its partnership with TSB); the Shell LSO Scholarship boosts the careers of fledgling orchestral players. Most democratic of all is <b> Sainsbury's Choir of the Year</b>, which is a genuine company initiative at which members of the Sainsbury family turn up in force rather than an event to which their name is merely tagged. Thanks to their commitment, several thousands of amateurs in the past 16 years have had a chance to enjoy the pleasures of singing to professional standards. </p> <p>The biennial competition is now halfway through regional trials for this year's event (the televised final takes place in December). To cater for the auspicious growth in children's choirs, a new under-12s category has been introduced. As a result, this year, more than 300 choirs, amounting to 12,000 singers, have entered, breaking previous records. Last week, for the Southern Region heats, the Anvil in Basingstoke swarmed with nearly 1,000 children and teenagers dressed in an assorted range of snappy uniforms. </p> <p>Of 10 fine choirs in the youth category, two - Berkshire Girls' and the Hildegard Choir, Oxford - proceed to the next round. These two groups, like most competing, are voluntary and not connected with schools. In fact, there's nothing educational about any of this enterprise, which makes it all the more moving. Every member sings out of choice rather than coercion. Judging from the results, they put immense time and effort into it, as do their trainers. Meanwhile the prophets of doom say music has gone to the dogs (a sentence first uttered in all likelihood at a Machaut premiere c1350). </p> <p>The 40 short pieces sung ranged from the familiar (John Rutter, Bart\u00f3k, Kodaly) to the unknown (a stirring, chesty 'Alleluia' by Anon), from barbershop swing to Reich-style clapping numbers. Not one was duplicated, which should gladden the hearts of choral composers.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's Choir of the Year 2000 The Anvil, Basingstoke The Tender Land Barbican, London EC2 Arvo P\u00e4rt Festival Royal Academy of Music Fickle money and needy art have frequent affairs and innumerable one-night stands. Such is the mercurial sphere of business sponsorship. Companies attach their names to artistic enterprises, get bored or fall on hard times, pull out and the projects fold. In rare cases, the relationship is faithful and astonishingly fruitful. British musical life has enjoyed three happy marriages in different areas. Lloyds Bank supported a generation of young school-aged soloists through BBC Young Musician of the Year (sadly abandoned since its partnership with TSB); the Shell LSO Scholarship boosts the careers of fledgling orchestral players. Most democratic of all is Sainsbury's Choir of the Year, which is a genuine company initiative at which members of the Sainsbury family turn up in force rather than an event to which their name is merely tagged. Thanks to their commitment, several thousands of amateurs in the past 16 years have had a chance to enjoy the pleasures of singing to professional standards. The biennial competition is now halfway through regional trials for this year's event (the televised final takes place in December). To cater for the auspicious growth in children's choirs, a new under-12s category has been introduced. As a result, this year, more than 300 choirs, amounting to 12,000 singers, have entered, breaking previous records. Last week, for the Southern Region heats, the Anvil in Basingstoke swarmed with nearly 1,000 children and teenagers dressed in an assorted range of snappy uniforms. Of 10 fine choirs in the youth category, two - Berkshire Girls' and the Hildegard Choir, Oxford - proceed to the next round. These two groups, like most competing, are voluntary and not connected with schools. In fact, there's nothing educational about any of this enterprise, which makes it all the more moving. Every member sings out of choice rather than coercion. Judging from the results, they put immense time and effort into it, as do their trainers. Meanwhile the prophets of doom say music has gone to the dogs (a sentence first uttered in all likelihood at a Machaut premiere c1350). The 40 short pieces sung ranged from the familiar (John Rutter, Bart\u00f3k, Kodaly) to the unknown (a stirring, chesty 'Alleluia' by Anon), from barbershop swing to Reich-style clapping numbers. Not one was duplicated, which should gladden the hearts of choral composers. As a massed warm-up exercise, one of the jurors, the charismatic choral trainer David Lawrence, persuaded these fiercely competitive choristers, and the audience too, to improvise the harmonies in an African folk song. Every person present got to their feet and waved arms and legs, clapped, clicked fingers and generally mastered the obscure consonants of an unknown language, voices soaring, within minutes transported to a celestial fantasy land. It's not what you expect from Basingstoke on a wet Saturday afternoon. Aaron Copland, the centenary of whose birth falls this year, would have enjoyed this display of all-join-in music making.

The room is disappointingly small and unprepossessing, but it has a lovely terrace out front which is virtually empty. I suggest to Arthur that we move outside. No, he tells me, that's where the 'poor' people sit. He continues his explanation: 'And you see those tables over there? Those are where the important people sit. And you see these six booths here? Well, these are like gold dust and THIS corner booth, where we are sitting, THIS IS THE KING OF THE BOOTHS!' </p> <p>Apparently Arthur always gets the King booth whenever he's in town at the express order of the owner, the Sultan of Brunei, for whom Arthur did a favour involving kosher kitchens. Just then a waiter appears: 'Miss Goldie Hawn on the phone for you sir...' </p> <p>Dinner with the British director Stephen Frears. After taking us on a wild goose chase for a sushi restaurant we end up at an old-fashioned Italian called Madeo's where, Stephen assures me, ALL the European directors eat, because it has real European food. Stephen tells us about working with George Clooney on a brilliant-sounding TV play that he's directing which will go out LIVE in black and white on CBS next week. It's called Failsafe. Then he tells me that he hopes Wim Wenders wins the Documentary Oscar for Buena Vista Social Club. 'I feel sorry for him,' he says. 'You have no idea how difficult it is being a middle-aged director.' </p> <p> <strong> Thursday and Friday</strong> </p> <p> My wife has become seriously ill. Arthur recommends a Chinese herbalist called Dr Zhu, who apparently treats all the celebrities, including Elizabeth Taylor, but he doesn't really do the trick so we opt for a more conventional doctor. At the clinic the level of attention and service is incredible - but the bill (we had no insurance) is hard to swallow. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday</strong> </p> <p> We drive down to Santa Monica in our black, open-top, new-style VW Beetle (which turns more heads than any star) for the Bafta tea party. Frightfully civilised affair with strawberries and cream, Earl Grey tea and cucumber sandwiches. Sam Mendes travels up in the lift with us to the function room looking like a cross between Orson Welles and a young Don Corleone. A lot of people come up to me and say how much they liked One Day in September. There seems to be a genuine buzz about it. But I'm more conscious than ever about how difficult it will be to beat Buena Vista Social Club, the most commercially successful documentary ever, because it's such a feel-good film. Ours is most definitely a feel-BAD film. </p> <p>That evening we go to a screening of our film and do a Q&amp;A session. People are genuinely moved. It's the first time I've witnessed the reaction of such a large audience: very encouraging. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday</strong> </p> <p> The big day. Get up late and go down to the hotel pool. The place is mobbed and it's apparent from the conversations that EVERYONE is here for the Oscars. They're all discussing which after-show parties they're going to go to: '...well, if The Sixth Sense wins for script and supporting actor we'll go to Universal and then on to Miramax and end up at Vanity Fair but in the unlikely event that Cider House Rules...' </p> <p>I experience the very pinnacle of luxury: a pool attendant sprays me with 'cooling' Evian spray. I know it's all downhill from here. </p> <p>The producer of The Sixth Sense, Barry Mendel, comes up and says how much he liked our film. I'm beginning to sense that we might be in with a chance. This sense is only heightened by an article in the LA Times which lists the favourites of the two chief critics. Both pick our film. But any sense of optimism is dashed when a friend calls to tell me that Wim Wenders has already published his acceptance speech in Germany. Surely if he's that confident, he MUST know something we don't. </p> <p>At 2pm, Justine Wright, the brilliant editor who cut our film arrives to get changed with us. Her bright pink hair causes a bit of a stir. She takes a swim without putting her head in the water for fear that she'll leave a pink streak up the pool. </p> <p>The poolside is now empty and the limos are already stretching around the block in front of the hotel. The lobby is in chaos. </p> <p>We meet up with the rest of the party - John Battsek, the film's other producer, his girlfriend, father, sister and business partner. Somehow we all manage to squeeze into the same limo. </p> <p>As we approach the Shrine Auditorium, protesters line the streets : 'Keep film jobs in LA!' and 'Stop Abortion NOW!' - the latter accompanied by revolting poster-sized pictures of aborted foetuses; this is apparently an attack on the multi-nominated film The Cider House Rules, which has a pro-choice theme. </p> <p>The limo jam is immense but finally we pull up and emerge into the searing sunlight and the surreal sight of thousands of people in evening dress, bleachers full of screaming fans, paparazzi everywhere...</p> <p>Quickly traversing the hysteria we make our way inside and settle down for the show. </p> <p>Our award is number nine and as the ceremony begins with Billy Crystal's hilarious film montage the nerves start to tighten.

Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke are the presenters. Just as they start giving their naff little introduction about 'what a documentary is' ('A film without any actors - gee, we might all be out of a job!' - who writes this stuff?), a camera comes down into the audience where the documentary nominees are sitting. We'd been told in advance that the camera moves to the winner - and there it goes straight to Wim Wenders! </p> <p>John, Arthur and I all look at each other and share the same thought: 'Oh well, that's that.' Then Uma opens the envelope and says those magic words: 'And the Oscar goes to... One Day in September !' </p> <p>I feel the way you're supposed to feel in a car accident - utterly, irrationally calm. </p> <p>Up we go on to the stage. All I can remember now is looking down and seeing Tom Cruise smiling up at us and thinking: 'How does he get his teeth that white?' Arthur talked on too long and neither John nor I got a chance to say our little bits. The music started playing us off... never mind. Suddenly we're being led into the backstage and being herded through press rooms to be prodded, questioned and photographed. (We learn later that Wim Wenders stormed out as we went up for our award.) </p> <p>And 20 minutes later you're spat back out into your seats, clutching an incredibly heavy new ornament that your wife is already threatening to consign to a cupboard because it doesn't go with the decor. </p> <p>The rest of the night is a blur - too much champagne, the horrendously star-studded Vanity Fair party (a little like All Bar One on Wardour Street on a Friday night except every second woman is either over 6ft tall, wearing Versace or Jennifer Aniston) and a live interview while utterly plastered to the long-suffering viewers of Sky television.

He was 19 and an apprentice engineer with Vickers Armstrong. He'd had designs on being the next James Dean, but that evening he decided O'Toole would do just as well.</p> <p>Three years later, the pair were sharing the stage at the National in Hamlet. Gambon was carrying a spear. 'O'Toole had just done Lawrence of Arabia,' he remembers. 'We were all in awe of him, us walk-ons. We'd walk on and stare at him. Stand there with our spears and work our way nearer to him, you know, shuffle across the stage just to get close.'</p> <p>Four decades later, Gambon is back at the Albery and in his element - wing-collared and wild-haired in a smoky dressing-room deep under the theatre. He is rehearsing a new play, Cressida, with a young group of actors. I wonder if he's noticed them edging across stage towards him yet.</p> <p>'Nah, nah nah. That's all gone,' he says, in his lugubrious Tommy Cooper voice, with a little deadpan dismay. 'Those were the days of deference, weren't they? You don't get it now. The world's changed.'

Asked why he chose to do this play, he stage-whispers: 'I'll do anything they offer me.' It sometimes seems that is not far from the truth. In recent months, he has starred memorably in two TV series - Wives and Daughters and Longitude; he teamed up with Al Pacino, an old friend, in Michael Mann's Oscar-nominated The Insider, and he has just completed the filming of Beckett's Endgame with David Thewlis in Dublin (or 'Paddywood' as he calls it).</p> <p>Cressida, a comedy written by Nicholas Wright, former script director at the National, gives him the role of gnarled mentor - 'It's set in 1610 in the Blackfriars Theatre.

'I was talking to Robert DeNiro,' he says, half-smiling, in response to a question about his life outside the theatre. 'He said, \"I don't fucking want anyone knowing anything at all about me.\" That's about how I feel.' In place of self-revelation, he offers little parables about his craft. Ask him about his formative years and he'll say: 'What's engineering got to do with acting? Acting is very precise. Plays have a mechanical structure. If one of the cogs doesn't work, then the play shudders, just as a machine shudders.'</p> <p>Question him about his relationship with his parents, who moved to Camden Town from Dublin when he was five, and he mutters good naturedly. 'Oh, OK. So, er, it's all simple stuff, acting. I don't overcomplicate it. There's no mystery there.'</p> <p>Only part of this evasion is a defence mechanism, you guess; partly, it seems to speak of a disinterest in introspection. If Gambon has a complex nature, he seems to keep it well hidden, even from himself. Recalling what was perhaps his finest hour, in The Singing Detective, he says, self-deprecatingly: 'I had a terrible job trying to work out what it was all about. It's very deep stuff, you know. Jon Amiel, the director, would say, \"Look, you're thick, I'll explain every day what's going on.\" So one day, he'd say, \"Today, you're doing someone that doesn't really exist except in your imagination.\" To act well in that kind of thing, you need to unclutter your mind a bit.'</p> <p>Gambon has many strategies for mind-uncluttering, which is a persistent professional and, probably, a psychological need for him. In his time away from the theatre, he makes precision clocks, restores antique firearms ('and flogs 'em'). 'If I'm in a West End play for six months, I do it during the day, or at least I do after the first few weeks, when I'm usually still shitting myself.' He also flies planes from Biggin Hill, and he'll generally hire a single-engine aircraft if he's in LA, a place he loves ('They call me Sir Gambon!'). 'I go up the coast, and there's an airport there with two runways. So you get clearance and you come in at 120 knots and next to you is this 737 from United coming in.

I love instrument flight. You trust your technique for a couple of hours, totally alone, follow your charts, and when you're 100 yards above ground, the runway lights are there, as if by magic.'</p> <p>Acting, you suspect, offers him another way of absorbing himself in technique: 'I wouldn't know what to do with myself if it wasn't for all this,' he says, gesturing around the chaotic dressing- room. 'Doing a play in the West End is like being in a sanctuary for six months. It cuts the world off. You're alone with this little team.'</p> <p>He only tried directing once, a curtain-raiser at the National. 'I found it lonely,' he recalls. 'The director tells the actors when the tea-break is. No one talked to me. They all ganged up.' He's been lucky with directors over the years, though, and he thinks Nicholas Hytner, who's doing Cressida, compares favourably with any of them. 'You want directors to be your dad,' he says. 'Nick's become my dad, so it's all right. Some refuse to do it. When they won't be your dad, you get nervous.'</p> <p>If his directors are his father figures, Gambon's fellow actors have always been brothers in arms. He says, unsentimentally, that he misses a little of the camaraderie of old days at the National, when after shows, invariably himself, Anthony Hopkins and others would have a quick drink. 'We'd go to the pub next door to the Vic, then we'd go to the Salisbury up the road. Then we'd go to the Buxton, an actor's club, behind the Haymarket. From the Buxton we'd go to Jerry's, another club. Get out of there about 2.30.

'Actors have all got mortgages and live in St John's Wood.'

      "bodyText": "Michael Gambon first visited the Albery Theatre 40 years ago to see Peter O'Toole in The Long and the Short and the Tall. It was the only play he had ever seen. He was 19 and an apprentice engineer with Vickers Armstrong. He'd had designs on being the next James Dean, but that evening he decided O'Toole would do just as well. Three years later, the pair were sharing the stage at the National in Hamlet. Gambon was carrying a spear. 'O'Toole had just done Lawrence of Arabia,' he remembers. 'We were all in awe of him, us walk-ons. We'd walk on and stare at him. Stand there with our spears and work our way nearer to him, you know, shuffle across the stage just to get close.' Four decades later, Gambon is back at the Albery and in his element - wing-collared and wild-haired in a smoky dressing-room deep under the theatre. He is rehearsing a new play, Cressida, with a young group of actors. I wonder if he's noticed them edging across stage towards him yet. 'Nah, nah nah. That's all gone,' he says, in his lugubrious Tommy Cooper voice, with a little deadpan dismay. 'Those were the days of deference, weren't they? You don't get it now. The world's changed.' He looks even more hangdog than usual, and then produces his wonderful one-note smoker's laugh: 'Huhhh.' Though Gambon, veteran of a string of definitive stage performances - he lists his own best of times as Galileo, Antony and Cleopatra and A View From the Bridge - is, in many ways, an awe-inspiring figure himself now, offstage he is happy still to cast himself as the untutored spear carrier.

      "body": "<p>'Never return', advised V.S. Naipaul. But we did, both of us. It was too much of a fluke not to - a chance that might not come again. In the same week, two houses came on the market. I was idling through the local paper when I suddenly saw it - like a familiar face in a crowd - our house.</p> <p>I had lived there all my life - it was sold when I was in my early twenties. I was abroad at the time, I had not left it knowingly. There it was, with its magnolia tree in the front garden, apparently unmindful of the time gone by; its brickwork nicely pointed, more spruce than in our day. It was almost 20 years since I had walked up its uneven stone steps or stood in the hall and seen the sun fall through the orange and blue fanlight. Could I - should I - go and see it?</p> <p>And then I spotted the second house. I was not sure I had it right. But yes, it was the house my partner grew up in. I could not stop myself. I phoned one estate agent and urged my partner to phone the other. We were, I reasoned, more than buyers. We had a claim on the houses that had nothing to do with money. Could we buy the past back? Not a chance: both houses were beyond our means, inaccessible as our childhood.</p> <p>'Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again...', the first line of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, is famous for a reason. Everyone dreams of home. Gaston Bachelard in The Poetics of Space claims that the house is 'one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories and dreams of mankind', and he ransacks cellars, attics and French literature to prove it. But most significant for him is the house we were born in which, he thinks, is 'physically inscribed in us'.</p> <p>Roderick Peters, in his book Living with Dreams, suggests that home eludes easy definitions: 'Home is a word, the meaning of which seems obvious at first, but the more one tries to catch the heart of the meaning, the more it recedes before one.' He sees dreams of home as a wish to return to 'paradise'. Nostalgia's literal meaning is 'home pain'.</p> <p>A few years ago, there was a ring at my doorbell. A man I had never seen before stood on the step. At the gate was a woman, diffident, in a dark coat, in late middle age. The man explained that his wife used to live in my house and wondered whether it would be 'taking a liberty' if she were to come inside and look round.</p> <p>The woman explained that several families had lived in the house during the war. It had been 'draughty'. She asked me 'Are you happy here?' - as if it mattered to her. Yes, I replied. But something still seemed to be troubling her. I assumed it must be my alien taste. She said there was a particular room, in the basement, she would like to see. Of course, I said, and led the way into my son's untidy bedroom. She looked at it sombrely. I apologised for it. 'My mother died here,' she explained. She thanked me for showing her the room.</p> <p>I don't think she had ever liked the house much. She was not in search of paradise. She was trying to prove that the past had been - and gone. 'These are the steps my husband and I went down on our wedding day,' she said as she left. I watched as they went down them again.</p> <p>When my turn came to 'go home', I found the experience of seeing the house again like looking into the face of a dead person. The life - my remembered life - had gone. Through the back windows, I could see that the garden had been elegantly re-landscaped in an Italianate style - no doubt far more attractive than what had once been. But I felt a kind of vertigo. I kept blinking, trying to conjure back the cherry trees with leaky gum oozing out of their trunks, the giant irises the colour of faded brown velvet, the untidy fig and the border thick with lily of the valley. Where were the old-fashioned pink roses? The rusty swing? Where was the life that had fled?</p> <p>Inside, I felt disoriented too. The room that once had been my brother's austere bedroom, painted brown and white, where he had first played the oboe so piercingly that we had had to block our ears two floors below, was now a 'master bedroom' amply frilled, almost unrecognisable. My parents' bedroom had been consumed to extend the sitting room. Objectively, this was an improvement. But for me, it was a displacing of memory: the room where I first saw my brother's newborn face and where we opened our lumpy Christmas stockings did not exist any more. And the kitchen - the centre of the house - had become a study.</p> <p>Whatever was I expecting to find? I missed its shabby furniture, its William Morris PVC blind, its bashed pale green and cream gas stove. Where was the kitchen table? The room we used to call 'the nursery' was now an unforthcoming dining room. Only the grate which my mother once excitedly uncovered from behind plaster was still there, entwined with an ornamental iron vine, heavy with black grapes.</p> <p>I stood in my old bedroom, like the lady who had stood in my son's room. I was involved in a less emotionally strenuous ritual than hers. But I privately said a farewell to the bricks and mortar and to everything that had ever happened there. I touched the windowsill. And as I did this, I realised that I was saying goodbye to something that had already gone. It was a relief and a disappointment. I had a sudden sense of home's impermanence, a shivery intimation of mortality. The return home is an attempt to cheat time. But home can exist only in the present tense and in imagination.</p> <p>And then it was my partner's turn. On a landing among healthy rubber plants, I noticed a sign: 'Houses are made of brick and stone/ But only love can make a home.' Nothing about the house lived up to this trite truth.

The vendor had consulted a Feng Shui expert who had advised her to put in a 'relationship area' in the kitchen, an empty corner full of plants and mirrors where it seemed the only relationship could be with the dog. In passing, she showed us a framed photo of a Greek island and pointed out a fine white house. Her home.

For Robert Lowell 'returning' to a sheltered resort after 20 years, 'Nothing is deader than this small town main street' 'And now at my homecoming,/ the barked elms stand up like sticks along the street. / I am a foot taller than when I left,/ and cannot see the dirt at my feet.'

      "bodyText": "'Never return', advised V.S. Naipaul. But we did, both of us. It was too much of a fluke not to - a chance that might not come again. In the same week, two houses came on the market. I was idling through the local paper when I suddenly saw it - like a familiar face in a crowd - our house. I had lived there all my life - it was sold when I was in my early twenties. I was abroad at the time, I had not left it knowingly. There it was, with its magnolia tree in the front garden, apparently unmindful of the time gone by; its brickwork nicely pointed, more spruce than in our day. It was almost 20 years since I had walked up its uneven stone steps or stood in the hall and seen the sun fall through the orange and blue fanlight. Could I - should I - go and see it? And then I spotted the second house. I was not sure I had it right. But yes, it was the house my partner grew up in. I could not stop myself. I phoned one estate agent and urged my partner to phone the other. We were, I reasoned, more than buyers. We had a claim on the houses that had nothing to do with money. Could we buy the past back? Not a chance: both houses were beyond our means, inaccessible as our childhood. 'Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again...', the first line of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, is famous for a reason. Everyone dreams of home. Gaston Bachelard in The Poetics of Space claims that the house is 'one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories and dreams of mankind', and he ransacks cellars, attics and French literature to prove it. But most significant for him is the house we were born in which, he thinks, is 'physically inscribed in us'.

      "body": "<p>The first time Ian Dury was at the Tally Ho in Kentish Town in 1972 when he had just started to play with a band called Kilburn and the High Roads. I was transfixed. They broke all the musical barriers. The singer moved in an ungainly way around the stage, occasionally bumping into the guitarist who never stayed in the same spot for any two notes. The songs were funny and vivid vignettes of real life, all delivered in a gruff cockney accent.</p> <p>I was a DJ on BBC Radio London, and I told the listeners I had seen the most amazing band in years. After the third or fourth time I saw them play, Ian lurched at me and growled: 'Oi! You keep saying these nice things about us on the radio - why don't you manage us?' Gordon Nelki, my partner in Oval Records, was standing nearby. 'Why not?' he said. So we did.</p> <p>As a lecturer at Canterbury Art College, Ian was not obvious 'pop material'. For a start, he was 31 and convinced he had left it too late to be a star. As a result of having polio as a child, he also walked with a limp, which explained his unusual movements on stage.</p> <p>A larger-than-life persona, which had enabled him to deal with whatever taunts came his way, now became the basis for his public char acter. On and off stage, he could switch instantly from a menacing glower to a beguiling grin and he made his way through life using a mix of fear and charm.</p> <p>I've never seen a band play as many times as I saw Kilburn and the High Roads. Every performance was unique, though it has to be said there weren't many of us there. All the other bands on the London pub circuit were playing generic styles - country, rock'n'roll or rhythm and blues - but the Kilburns sounded like nobody else on earth, and not many people got the point at the time.</p> <p>Our primary role as managers was to get a record deal. We persuaded a subsidiary of Warners to make an album, but the band turned out to be impossible to record. None of them was a professional and they became inhibited when faced with a studio microphone. The album was shelved. We lined up a deal with newly formed Virgin, but Ian didn't fancy working with 'a bunch of hippies'.</p> <p>Four years later, Ian finally found the people who transformed his life. Chas Jankel, a young keyboard player, brought more structure and a contemporary feel to Ian's songs. Managers Andrew King and Peter Jenner funded demos which were taken to the newly formed Stiff Records where Dave Robinson was at the helm. Everything came together. In September 1977 Stiff released the album New Boots and Panties on the back of the first Stiff tour of the UK, featuring a rotating bill of Ian and his band, now known as the Blockheads, with Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and Wreckless Eric.</p> <p>Ian had little confidence in the sound of his voice, but like a number of successful British vocalists he made a virtue of his limitations, using clever couplets, rhymes and phrases to compensate. Word-of-mouth support kept the album in the charts for a year.</p> <p>Ian's first single epitomised his flair for finding a musical home for an indelible verbal phrase: 'Sex and drugs and rock and roll is all my brain and body need.' Radio 1 still didn't get the Stiff thing, but nothing could stand in the way of the three brilliant singles that followed: 'What a Waste', 'Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick' and 'Reasons to be Cheerful (Pt 3)'. Although this was the era of punk, these singles were not remotely like punk; they had a coherent, danceable sound but with lyrics that no funk band would ever touch. It's hard to imagine Chic singing 'I could be the ticket man on Fulham Broadway Station'.</p> <p>Ian's lasting fame is surprising considering his reign as a commercially successful recording artist was so brief - just a couple of years.

      "body": "<p>It's official: Labour believes Frank Dobson's campaign to become mayor of London is set to end in ignominious failure.</p> <p>Amid suggestions that fewer than one in five voters will support the government's official candidate, Labour sources believe Dobson is set to be humiliated by Ken Livingstone in the mayoral contest on 4 May.</p> <p>Philip Gould, Labour's principle polling adviser for the past 15 years, indicated last week that the Dobson campaign would now have to concentrate on damage limitation. He is expected to win 20 per cent of the vote, compared with 50 per cent for Livingstone.</p> <p>Dobson has still not been told when Tony Blair will find time to make a public appearance to support him, raising speculation that the Prime Minister does not want to be associated with Dobson's impending failure. But the former health secretary's aides hope it will happen in the next two weeks.</p> <p>In a bid to lessen the scale of Dobson's defeat, Labour will tomorrow begin an advertising campaign designed to highlight his reputation as a straight talker. Devised by one the advertising industry's leading creative directors, Trevor Beattie, of the TBWA agency, it will feature the slogan 'Frank and to the point'.</p> <p>However, the prospect of a heavy defeat is already concentrating Labour's minds on a strategy for coping with Livingstone if he becomes London's elected Mayor.</p> <p>One minister told The Observer: 'I don't foresee any problem. In the election, Ken will be out canvassing for us, because basically he wants to get back - and good.'</p> <p>But others say that Livingstone can never be forgiven for breaking his pledge not to run against an official party candidate.</p> <p>Livingstone's expulsion from the party will become official tomorrow when nominations for the mayoral election close. The MP for Brent East has been suspended since he said he would run as an independent, and will be deemed to have expelled himself by entering an election against an official party candidate. Any party member who has signed his nomination papers will also be expelled.</p> <p>Yesterday Livingstone's campaign headquarters confirmed that his nomination papers have already been lodged, but refused to say who had signed them.</p> <p>Livingstone earlier told The Observer: 'I'm going to ensure that there are no more than three or four expulsions. Party members who turn up offering to help are being turned away. I want to ensure that they are still in the Labour Party because I want them to take me back. And they will, because I'm an engaging little worm.'</p> <p>Last week, Dobson was invited to Number 10 for a morale-boosting social gathering with the candidates for the Greater London Assembly and party workers.</p> <p>The evening was also meant to counter complaints that the party's big names have been reluctant to involve themselves publicly in the Dobson campaign.

      "bodyText": "It's official: Labour believes Frank Dobson's campaign to become mayor of London is set to end in ignominious failure. Amid suggestions that fewer than one in five voters will support the government's official candidate, Labour sources believe Dobson is set to be humiliated by Ken Livingstone in the mayoral contest on 4 May. Philip Gould, Labour's principle polling adviser for the past 15 years, indicated last week that the Dobson campaign would now have to concentrate on damage limitation. He is expected to win 20 per cent of the vote, compared with 50 per cent for Livingstone. Dobson has still not been told when Tony Blair will find time to make a public appearance to support him, raising speculation that the Prime Minister does not want to be associated with Dobson's impending failure. But the former health secretary's aides hope it will happen in the next two weeks. In a bid to lessen the scale of Dobson's defeat, Labour will tomorrow begin an advertising campaign designed to highlight his reputation as a straight talker. Devised by one the advertising industry's leading creative directors, Trevor Beattie, of the TBWA agency, it will feature the slogan 'Frank and to the point'. However, the prospect of a heavy defeat is already concentrating Labour's minds on a strategy for coping with Livingstone if he becomes London's elected Mayor. One minister told The Observer: 'I don't foresee any problem. In the election, Ken will be out canvassing for us, because basically he wants to get back - and good.' But others say that Livingstone can never be forgiven for breaking his pledge not to run against an official party candidate. Livingstone's expulsion from the party will become official tomorrow when nominations for the mayoral election close. The MP for Brent East has been suspended since he said he would run as an independent, and will be deemed to have expelled himself by entering an election against an official party candidate. Any party member who has signed his nomination papers will also be expelled. Yesterday Livingstone's campaign headquarters confirmed that his nomination papers have already been lodged, but refused to say who had signed them. Livingstone earlier told The Observer: 'I'm going to ensure that there are no more than three or four expulsions. Party members who turn up offering to help are being turned away. I want to ensure that they are still in the Labour Party because I want them to take me back. And they will, because I'm an engaging little worm.' Last week, Dobson was invited to Number 10 for a morale-boosting social gathering with the candidates for the Greater London Assembly and party workers. The evening was also meant to counter complaints that the party's big names have been reluctant to involve themselves publicly in the Dobson campaign. Both Blair and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, spoke at the event. Blair told the gathering he was 'still optimistic' that a Dobson victory was possible 'if we get down to it'. He also lamented short memories which have caused Londoners to forget the record of the Greater London Council (GLC) under Livingstone's leadership in the early Eighties. He stressed how easy it would be 'to slip back into all that'. However, Livingstone's campaign will receive a big financial boost tomorrow evening when works by a collection of the best known artists working in Britain go under the hammer. Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Howard Hodgkin, Sir Anthony Caro, Antony Gormley, Gillian Ayres, Maggi Hambling and Cornelia Parker have all donated works for the private sale, which will be held at London gallery Gimpel Fils. Bidding for the Hirst spin painting, Beautiful Butterbomb, is expected to top \u00a340,000. Tracey Emin has donated Exploration of the Soul , a hard-cover book with original drawings and autobiographical photographs. This is expected to go for around \u00a31,000, while Sarah Lucas' collage of tabloid newspaper pages, Shine On , is likely to reach \u00a33,000. 'We have had a fantastic reaction right across the generations of artists,' said Peter Kennard, who has co-ordinated the show. 'I have known Ken since the days of the GLC,' he said. 'He has always supported the cultural base of the city and there were was an amazing period of artistic activity during his time at County Hall.' \u0095 andy.mcsmith@observer.co.uk vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

Official figures show that large numbers of people are dropping out of the scheme's education and training courses, the largest of four options on offer to help the jobless find work. And most people leaving the courses are not finding jobs, but being recycled into other New Deal options, including subsidised or voluntary work and places on environmental task forces, the statistics show. The new information, revealed in answers to parliamentary questions, shows that over the first year and a half of the New Deal: \u0095 Only one in 10 people who take education and training courses complete them before leaving the New Deal. \u0095 The number of people leaving the courses in the first year and ending up in long-term jobs was as low as 8.4 per cent, although the Government disputes this. \u0095 The Government does not know how many or what type of qualifications have been gained by 'new dealers' because its computer systems are not up to the task of finding out. The New Deal is a central part of the Government's 'Welfare to Work' strategy, and aims to get people off benefits and into long-term employment. Last week Ministers claimed the programme was transforming the welfare state, and announced a major extension of its schemes to people aged over 25. The latest concerns centre on the training and education option - which takes nearly half the people on New Deal schemes. Of the 140,000 people who went through the programme from the start of pilot schemes in January 1998 until July 1999 nearly half were on education and training courses. Ministers say the courses are designed to give people the skills they need to get jobs. They claim that the high 'non-completion' figures represent a healthy turnover of people, which is a normal part of the labour market. But Opposition spokesmen say it shows that people are failing to stay on courses and that the New Deal is turning into a 'revolving door', where the unemployed are 'churned' from one scheme to another without breaking into the jobs market. Government figures show that 29,472 people left these courses between January 1998 and July 1999. They also show that only 3,213 - or 10.9 per cent - completed them before leaving the New Deal. Ministers produced figures last year showing that 46 per of those on the training courses who could be traced after leaving the New Deal ended up in 'sustained' unsubsidised jobs - meaning that the work lasted for more than 13 weeks. But Liberal Democrat employment spokesman Richard Allan said the real figure is a fraction of this because the Government is ignoring the people it cannot trace. Allan points to figures released last week which show that only 7,024 of the 29,472 who left education and training courses finished completely with the New Deal. The remainder went on to other schemes within the programme. Of those who left, 2,488 went into jobs. This amounts to only 8.5 per cent of those who quit training and education schemes. A DfEE spokesman said this figure should be seen as 35 per cent of the 7,024 who left the New Deal, but he conceded that it was only 8.5 per cent of those who had left training. He added that the 3,213 figure for those who did complete courses could really have been higher. Many might not have started courses until the previous autumn, and would not have been recorded in the system. The official admitted that the Government's labour market information systems could not keep track of all people who had been on the schemes.

The move is designed to end the problems of homelessness among ex-convicts, but Ministers are bracing themselves for an outcry from those who think the Government is going soft on criminals, and from law-abiding would-be tenants who are stuck on long waiting lists. Tory MP John Redwood said last night: 'Not everyone will agree with John Prescott's priorities. This is exactly the sort of thing that should be left to local councils to decide.' But the move is seen as essential to cutting crime in the inner city, where a large proportion of the homeless are people who have served relatively short terms in jail and been released without anywhere to live, making it likely they will return to crime. Chris Holmes, director of the housing charity Shelter, vigorously defended what he hailed as a bold Government decision. He said: 'It's an important way of ensuring that people, especially young people, coming out of prison have got somewhere safe to live, so reducing the risk of their re-offending. It also improves opportunities to find work.' The new rule will also apply to others who have been recently institutionalised, including adolescents who have been living in council care, unmarried ex-servicemen and single people - mostly women - who have fled from domestic violence. People in these groups languish at the bottom of housing lists under the present system - if they get on waiting lists at all - because they have no dependent children and cannot plead illness or disability. Prescott's Green Paper will also announce a speed-up of the sale of council estates to housing associations and other bodies with more freedom to borrow money to pay for a \u00a320 billion backlog of repairs. Some councils in Scotland have already divested their entire council stock. The Green Paper will also include measures to help first-time home buyers. One idea is that developers in the South-East would be able to sell new homes at below market price to members of certain key professions, such as nurses and teachers, and reclaim the difference from the Government.",

His remarks about Ecstasy came as a surprise after the Government's outright rejection of proposals in last week's report from the respected Police Foundation inquiry, which called for the decriminalisation of cannabis and the downgrading of ecstasy from a Class A to a Class B drug.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There comes a time in every man's life when he is an unbearably arrogant and pompous snot. Luckily, it happened to Nicky Campbell about 18 years ago - since then his snottiness has been, well, drying up. Lucky for us, given that if he were still as awful now as he was then, and presiding over the show that's become the new byword for intelligent, successful radio, he would be a cocksure monster. Probably lucky for him, too, because otherwise he would, by this stage in his life, have an awfully sore face.</p> <p>Aberdeen University in the early 80s, and Campbell and his best friend Iain Glen, now known as the actor Iain Glen, were the cocks o' the walk - swanning, strutting, preening and bullying their way through student life, like some absurd tartan version of Brideshead Revisited , with plastic beer glasses instead of champagne flutes. I know this because I was there, sneering from the sidelines, being - isn't hindsight a wonderful thing - probably equally unbearable, but in a wholly different way. They ran the drama society, they snogged each other on stage for shock value, they presided over their bitchy coterie, and Christ didn't we want to give them a fine smacking.</p> <p>Almost two decades later, we shake hands. In fact, we shake while his show's on air. Campbell makes a diplomatic point of diving out during the travel slot after I appear in the control room. Later, remembering those days, he gives what can only be described as a wry grin, for he is, almost constantly, a wry man. 'Yes, you're probably right. Brideshead is about right. The golden boys and all that. Christ.' Did he like what he now looked back on? Would the man have liked the boy? 'At that time? I probably would have seen some merit, but also\u0085 yes, I would have thought I was a bit of a pain in the arse.'</p> <p>Wryness - the intelligent Scot's substitute for courtesy. He uses it in the same way, both to charm you and to subtly warn you off dangerous ground. It's not until about half an hour into the interview that I feel I'm getting anything beyond the self-deprecations of a smart radio personality. (Also, I make the mistake, perhaps, of breaking the sad news about a long-distant, mutual Edinburgh friend who died, tragically, a few years ago. I hadn't known Campbell hadn't known. He is genuinely, openly shocked and saddened, and actually takes a little while to recover.)</p> <p>Smart. Intelligent. It's the word most often used about him; even by people who profess to hate radio phone-ins. In the course of our conversation, he happily drops in the kind of words you don't always expect - eclectic, tendentious, elision, invidious - when chatting to an ex-Radio 1 DJ or game- show host. But, of course, that was never the real Nicky Campbell, whereas this is. He freely admits he felt like 'a square peg in a round hole' at Radio 1. 'It was a little bit pissing into the wind sometimes. And you had to move with the times very fast. I changed style quite a few times over the years there, because I didn't realise there was some where else to go. Coming home to Radio 5 was like coming home to a place I'd never been. I wake up every morning and I can't believe that I'm going to be doing this.'</p> <p>'This' is his daily, three-hour morning show on R5 Live, the station's flagship, which is picking up listeners as fast as the old R1 used to shed them. It's not just a victory for R5, but a victory for those who argue these days against the 'dumbing down' of broadcasting; although the format - listeners calling in to air their views, plus studio contributions from the day's panellists - is user-friendly, the subject matter isn't necessarily so. In the week or so around our interview, the programme had a few little fun items up for discussion, food or fashion or football, but the bulk of the talk was on Chechnya, or the Euro, or grammar schools, or state subsidies for car firms, or national sovereignty, or the jury system. These are subjects that terrify most editors of quality broadsheets, who wonder how quietly they can cover them without boring the reader. Yet, increasingly, with listening figures up around 2 million and climbing daily, these are the very subjects Britain wants to talk about, for three hours every morning.</p> <p>So the audience is out there for serious stuff, and it's just the media who have got it wrong with the constant drive for celebrity? 'Yes. The audience is definitely out there. You put up a subject, and suddenly realise that there are a huge amount of people out there who are fascinated by it, and have something to say, and say it well - many people in this country are tremendously articulate. And, of course, they're always going to be interested if it's something that affects the way they live - health, education, what we call the heartland issues.'</p> <p>It is also, it should be said, fun. There's a grand chemistry going on between the presenter and his editor, Mark Sandell, and between the panellists, and the callers. The lack of a rigid format means that guests and callers alike can be asked to comment on topics other than their main interest, according to Campbell's whim. When Graham Souness comes on air, as he does on the morning we meet, he knows he's not just been phoned to talk about football; he gets quizzed about dot.com millionaires and whatever else has been bothering listeners, and answers with relish. PJ O'Rourke, a recent guest, overstayed his slot by half an hour to stay to the end because he was enjoying it so much, leaving with the words: 'I don't know what all that was about, but I loved it.'</p> <p>The sophisticated screening process helps get the decent callers through and keep the madder buggers unheard. Campbell is happy to stay off air when two callers click, letting them argue for long minutes. And he fosters the sense of ease with his choice of language - it's bloke-in-the-street talk without the swearing. And, look, I know this all just sounds like an outrageous piece of puffery, but honestly it's a damn fine programme, and I speak as a recent convert from Radio 4, despite the supremely irritating fact that because the station's still only on medium wave, I have to lug an old beast of a Bush radio, the size of a Welsh dresser, through to the bedroom every morning.</p> <p>'What we're trying to do in R5 Live in general is, I suppose, wise up,' he says. 'We've wised up news radio. I think dumbing down is a misapplied term. Misappropriated as well. What annoys me is when you hear certain presenters on more traditional radio stations doing a piece on Mo Mowlam and cannabis, for instance, and using terminology such as \"experimented with cannabis\" - that is, if you want to use the horrible phrase, I think that is dumbing down; when you hear presenters on the more staid stations doing interviews about \"the drugs threat\" at the forthcoming \"pop\" festival - excruciating, embarrassing terms.'</p> <p>I pause to ask, tongue in cheek, whether he himself had 'experimented with cannabis'. 'Yes. Of course. Um\u0085' he suddenly catches himself, remembering he's being interviewed. 'Oh, God\u0085 Did you? Well, OK, as long as you add in \"as did the writer of this piece\".'</p> <p>In general, he particularly likes doing politicians, particularly when they've been softened up by callers' questions. Not all of them like it. 'There are some politicians, notable politicians, who won't do the show because they want to see all the questions beforehand, and they won't take calls. But, frankly, I don't care how many Jags they've got\u0085'</p> <p>He tries to keep his own politics quiet - the old BBC impartiality - and, although it's pretty obvious that he's soft-left (in the way Scottish middle-class kids whose formative years were the 80s have, by law, to be), he seems to succeed on air. 'I find it gratifying that I get complaints. Left-wing people say I'm too right wing, the right complain I'm too left. Scots complain that I've sold out, the English complain that I'm too Scottish. Gratifying, I suppose, in terms of my stances - well, if I'm at some dinner party and meet some major serving in Northern Ireland, then, probably like you, I would tend towards the Republican route of argument. But if you meet some green-eyed Republican you would do the other. It's a little bit of a Scottish trait, isn't it, a little bit of the argument - in-an-empty-room syndrome. And that's without drink.'</p> <p>He is growing a little uncomfortable. He loves talking about the programme, but hates talking about himself - at least these days, he does. He knows he's good at his job, but doesn't really want to analyse why. There are jokes, deflections, wryness, but no answers. I press on. 'Well... I'm not very good at talking about it. I suppose I was lucky. A good upbringing. Mum [he is adopted] was a psychiatric social worker, Dad was a publisher, and he was the greatest mixer with people, far greater than I was, am; a fantastic communicator and human being. He could talk to anyone, and everyone would talk to him, and if I would aspire to anything... I'm far less of a man than he was. He was far more likeable. He didn't cut his cloth for anyone, he just connected with people and people with him.'</p> <p>So he's given an answer, of sorts, but by talking about someone else. It seems strange, this strong reluctance towards any kind of self-analysis, his wariness of the whole idea of this interview, his self- consciousness in front of the photographer. For this is the man who, it had seemed, had been courting fame all his adult life, with great shouts and waves. The Radio 1 roadshows, the grinning, pancaked Wheel of Fortune days, the college showboating, the arrogance... and then, belatedly, I realise that the answer probably has much to do with this show and the position it has brought him. He calls it 'the most exciting thing I've ever done', and I believe him. The irony here, of course, is that, as soon as he stopped chasing fame with such schoolboy vigour and settled down doing something he knew he was simply very good at, fame, proper fame, with genuine acknowledgement of his talent, came back to knock on his door, clutching, it is said, about \u00a3250,000 a year.</p> <p>The wait for acknowledgment obviously rankles a little. At one point, talking about the reviews the show's getting, he says, 'Well, yeah, but the point is that when I was working hard on Radio 1, writing and writing, and doing it for 10 years, no one from The Observer ever wanted to talk to me.</p> <p>'Certainly, yes, I used to want to be famous. When I was growing up, when Iain and I were in what you call the Brideshead years - not entirely misplaced - certainly that was the case, right through my twenties and early thirties. But it's kind of gone now.</p> <p>'What's changed? Well, being happy. Having met Tina. Kids change you incredibly.' He has one young daughter, and his (second) wife, Tina Ritchie, former head of news at Virgin Radio, is expecting another shortly. 'And hitting my late thirties... you're different at 38 than you are at 33. And it changes you as a broadcaster as well. So if I never did another thing on the telly again it wouldn't bother me in the slightest. But, yes, I did have that drive. And it did propel me.'</p> <p>Mention of TV brings us briefly to Newsnight , on which he did a stint as presenter, among some acrimonious internal BBC wrangling over whether he was or wasn't joining, as the 'new Paxman'. He was said to be angry - or, rather, 'friends of Nicky Campbell' were said to be angry - at the fact that, despite his being officially invited across at the highest levels, others tried to play down his appointment as low-key and temporary, and sneered at the game-show years. I suspect he was indeed angry at the time, perhaps righteously so, as the intelligent professional misunderstood and spun against. But he seems remarkably sanguine about it all, blaming it, and that rather mildly, on a cock-up by the BBC's press office. 'Anyway, it was a good week. And I think those people who did have doubts realise that the world's still turning.' Did he harbour an ambition as the next Paxman? 'No. No, really. I'd like to do a TV version of this show. Maybe. But Paxman... no I think Paxman's probably the next Paxman. And the last Paxman. No, now, today, I don't really think there's anything for me to prove.'</p> <p>He's relaxed, supremely so, about not being an actor, despite this having been his main ambition in his twenties - the prime reason he went to his first radio station, Northsound, was to get his Equity card. He thinks back to those days, before local radio, and remembers the irony of the fact he and Iain Glen would derive such pleasure from winding up radio phone-ins with spoof calls. 'On one show, on Radio Forth, there were 12 callers in the hour, and we were eight of them. When I was doing one, being a vet advising on rabies, my mother had it on in the garden and came in to find me saying, \"You must listen to this dreadful man\", and then she saw me on the phone. Yes, quite ironic, doing all that with Iain, that I ended up doing this on radio. And he ended up naked on stage with Nicole Kidman. Bastard.'</p> <p>He's even relaxed, now, about Wheel of Fortune - so much so that he was making self-knowing cracks about tacky game shows on that morning's programme. In the past, I've been a bit embarrassed about it, because people have made me feel embarrassed about it. But it was tremendous fun! And I can't pretend the money wasn't quite good. But there's also a positive legacy from it. I think it makes people want to talk to you a little bit. I was filming with Newsnight , something on the homeless round the back of the Savoy, and we were having problems, they were shouting at us, \"You're no filming here, how'd you like us walking into yer living rooms, now go away, fuck off.\" Then one took one look at me and goes \"Nickaaay!\", and we were in... I think the Newsnight people were a bit taken aback. Also, as I get more mature, I think there's less of a reason to be embarrassed.'</p> <p>The maturity, this new ease, is also, of course, to do with being out of his first marriage and with Tina. His first wife, Linda Larnack, had ME, which he nursed her through. The break-up was acrimonious. He describes it now as probably the worst period of his life (and this as the best), but doesn't want to talk much further. 'I chose as my path silence and I think that's far more dignified - I think it's even a little undignified saying that. But, hey, my friends know the truth and I know the truth, and that's really as much as matters to me. It would be horrible for me to start going, \"Well, let me tell you this, and that, what really happened.\" You may say that's a glib response, but that's as far as I want to go on it. Because, not only was it six years ago, but to an extent it's been vindicated by history.'</p> <p>When did things start to get better again? 'Well, you go through a sort of emotional no-man's-land. I think it was meeting Tina and finding out that - well, you get used to bad situations, like people get used to abusive situations, and, without giving too much away, I suppose I was used to, in a sense, an abusive situation. And you think that that's normality, then when you move on and move out you realise it's not: life can be happy.</p> <p>'But it's really kind of dull talking about this stuff. You start to sound Californian. I'm not even sure that when I'm on the skids and I write the book I'll do any of this kind of stuff. I mean' - and he leans forward, voice rising, there is still, for a moment, remembered anger here - 'I mean, there's some fucking brilliant stories, some fucking brilliant bits of vindication, but' - and he settles back, and smiles. 'But hey. What's the point?'</p> <p>He's also come to terms, far more easily than many can, with the fact of his adoption. It doesn't seem to be any kind of problem for him. He tracked down his real mother, and that was fine, he says, and that was that, except for a bit of tabloid crap which isn't worth bothering about (I've read it. He's right). But he then starts talking football, and his mother is back in the picture as he muses. 'When I grew up, I had this mad passion for Celtic, the 1967 European Cup triumph and everything, Jock Stein, Dalglish, Lennox - all over my bedroom, it was Celtic, Celtic, Celtic. Then - well, it was untenable, being brought up as a Protestant. Not that it would have bothered my parents, it's just that - well, you'll know, you couldn't do it, it didn't make any sense. Then when I traced my parentage - which was no great emotional journey for me, it was merely inquisitive - I found out that it all happened in Dublin. Which made me wonder whether there's a genetic basis for football support. And if so, it leads on, with all this new technology, that - this is the exciting bit - there might well come a time when we can eradicate the Manchester United gene.'</p> <p>Tabloids apart, what makes him angry these days, I wondered; for we seemed to have found ourselves floating in a world of pleasant forgiveness and mature reflection. 'I don't know. Really. And if anything makes me angry these days... well, I can go home, to a lovely, secure family now, whatever happens. Things get me angry within the BBC. The stolid, conservative, conventional approach gets me angry. And some views you hear on the show get you angry. Insane racism, stuff like that, stuff that defies logic. Or racist literature saying go home you Scot. Or wog-lover. But these things annoy any right-minded person, not just me.</p> <p>'I really don't think there's much. You see, life's different. I'm different. Take my Saturdays. I suppose my dream Saturday now is going for a run in the morning, then round the corner for a burger or something, lunch with the baby, back home to read, and a carry-out and a video in the evening. It gets really boring, bourgeois, middle class, conventional. But it's much better than the rock'n'roll years. Yes, they were a bit rock'n'roll. Yes, I rocked, and yes, I rolled. But looking back on it, I think, Christ, most of it was a complete waste of time.</p> <p>'We've got a house near Kyle of Lochalsh now, near Skye. We want to up sticks and go there one day. And if I want to do that, and work for Radio Highland, then that's not a problem for me. If you'd said that to me 10 years ago, I would have told you to bugger off, said no way, I want to be on television. But life changes. And you've got something up there, that if you live down here you can never have unless you're Melvyn Bragg or Dale Winton - a garden, a big garden.'</p> <p>Which brings me accidentally, neatly to a final question. The coincidence of those two names: the revered communicator and the housewives' favourite. Which of the two, I wonder, would Nicky Campbell, caught somewhere bang in the middle, rather be?</p> <p>'Melvyn Bragg or Dale Winton? Oh God.'</p> <p>Go on.</p> <p>'Bragg or Winton. Christ, Euan... I mean, is this shag or die?'</p> <p>He's failed to answer the question, again. But that's fine, in the end. I don't think it was actual evasion, for I don't think that it's a question he could answer. I think now, finally, he's actually quite happy being Nicky Campbell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There comes a time in every man's life when he is an unbearably arrogant and pompous snot. Luckily, it happened to Nicky Campbell about 18 years ago - since then his snottiness has been, well, drying up. Lucky for us, given that if he were still as awful now as he was then, and presiding over the show that's become the new byword for intelligent, successful radio, he would be a cocksure monster. Probably lucky for him, too, because otherwise he would, by this stage in his life, have an awfully sore face. Aberdeen University in the early 80s, and Campbell and his best friend Iain Glen, now known as the actor Iain Glen, were the cocks o' the walk - swanning, strutting, preening and bullying their way through student life, like some absurd tartan version of Brideshead Revisited , with plastic beer glasses instead of champagne flutes. I know this because I was there, sneering from the sidelines, being - isn't hindsight a wonderful thing - probably equally unbearable, but in a wholly different way. They ran the drama society, they snogged each other on stage for shock value, they presided over their bitchy coterie, and Christ didn't we want to give them a fine smacking. Almost two decades later, we shake hands. In fact, we shake while his show's on air. Campbell makes a diplomatic point of diving out during the travel slot after I appear in the control room. Later, remembering those days, he gives what can only be described as a wry grin, for he is, almost constantly, a wry man. 'Yes, you're probably right. Brideshead is about right. The golden boys and all that. Christ.' Did he like what he now looked back on? Would the man have liked the boy? 'At that time? I probably would have seen some merit, but also\u0085 yes, I would have thought I was a bit of a pain in the arse.' Wryness - the intelligent Scot's substitute for courtesy. He uses it in the same way, both to charm you and to subtly warn you off dangerous ground. It's not until about half an hour into the interview that I feel I'm getting anything beyond the self-deprecations of a smart radio personality. (Also, I make the mistake, perhaps, of breaking the sad news about a long-distant, mutual Edinburgh friend who died, tragically, a few years ago. I hadn't known Campbell hadn't known. He is genuinely, openly shocked and saddened, and actually takes a little while to recover.) Smart. Intelligent. It's the word most often used about him; even by people who profess to hate radio phone-ins. In the course of our conversation, he happily drops in the kind of words you don't always expect - eclectic, tendentious, elision, invidious - when chatting to an ex-Radio 1 DJ or game- show host. But, of course, that was never the real Nicky Campbell, whereas this is. He freely admits he felt like 'a square peg in a round hole' at Radio 1. 'It was a little bit pissing into the wind sometimes. And you had to move with the times very fast. I changed style quite a few times over the years there, because I didn't realise there was some where else to go. Coming home to Radio 5 was like coming home to a place I'd never been. I wake up every morning and I can't believe that I'm going to be doing this.' 'This' is his daily, three-hour morning show on R5 Live, the station's flagship, which is picking up listeners as fast as the old R1 used to shed them. It's not just a victory for R5, but a victory for those who argue these days against the 'dumbing down' of broadcasting; although the format - listeners calling in to air their views, plus studio contributions from the day's panellists - is user-friendly, the subject matter isn't necessarily so. In the week or so around our interview, the programme had a few little fun items up for discussion, food or fashion or football, but the bulk of the talk was on Chechnya, or the Euro, or grammar schools, or state subsidies for car firms, or national sovereignty, or the jury system. These are subjects that terrify most editors of quality broadsheets, who wonder how quietly they can cover them without boring the reader. Yet, increasingly, with listening figures up around 2 million and climbing daily, these are the very subjects Britain wants to talk about, for three hours every morning. So the audience is out there for serious stuff, and it's just the media who have got it wrong with the constant drive for celebrity? 'Yes. The audience is definitely out there. You put up a subject, and suddenly realise that there are a huge amount of people out there who are fascinated by it, and have something to say, and say it well - many people in this country are tremendously articulate. And, of course, they're always going to be interested if it's something that affects the way they live - health, education, what we call the heartland issues.' It is also, it should be said, fun. There's a grand chemistry going on between the presenter and his editor, Mark Sandell, and between the panellists, and the callers. The lack of a rigid format means that guests and callers alike can be asked to comment on topics other than their main interest, according to Campbell's whim. When Graham Souness comes on air, as he does on the morning we meet, he knows he's not just been phoned to talk about football; he gets quizzed about dot.com millionaires and whatever else has been bothering listeners, and answers with relish. PJ O'Rourke, a recent guest, overstayed his slot by half an hour to stay to the end because he was enjoying it so much, leaving with the words: 'I don't know what all that was about, but I loved it.' The sophisticated screening process helps get the decent callers through and keep the madder buggers unheard. Campbell is happy to stay off air when two callers click, letting them argue for long minutes. And he fosters the sense of ease with his choice of language - it's bloke-in-the-street talk without the swearing. And, look, I know this all just sounds like an outrageous piece of puffery, but honestly it's a damn fine programme, and I speak as a recent convert from Radio 4, despite the supremely irritating fact that because the station's still only on medium wave, I have to lug an old beast of a Bush radio, the size of a Welsh dresser, through to the bedroom every morning. 'What we're trying to do in R5 Live in general is, I suppose, wise up,' he says. 'We've wised up news radio. I think dumbing down is a misapplied term. Misappropriated as well. What annoys me is when you hear certain presenters on more traditional radio stations doing a piece on Mo Mowlam and cannabis, for instance, and using terminology such as \"experimented with cannabis\" - that is, if you want to use the horrible phrase, I think that is dumbing down; when you hear presenters on the more staid stations doing interviews about \"the drugs threat\" at the forthcoming \"pop\" festival - excruciating, embarrassing terms.' I pause to ask, tongue in cheek, whether he himself had 'experimented with cannabis'. 'Yes. Of course. Um\u0085' he suddenly catches himself, remembering he's being interviewed. 'Oh, God\u0085 Did you? Well, OK, as long as you add in \"as did the writer of this piece\".' In general, he particularly likes doing politicians, particularly when they've been softened up by callers' questions. Not all of them like it. 'There are some politicians, notable politicians, who won't do the show because they want to see all the questions beforehand, and they won't take calls. But, frankly, I don't care how many Jags they've got\u0085' He tries to keep his own politics quiet - the old BBC impartiality - and, although it's pretty obvious that he's soft-left (in the way Scottish middle-class kids whose formative years were the 80s have, by law, to be), he seems to succeed on air. 'I find it gratifying that I get complaints. Left-wing people say I'm too right wing, the right complain I'm too left. Scots complain that I've sold out, the English complain that I'm too Scottish. Gratifying, I suppose, in terms of my stances - well, if I'm at some dinner party and meet some major serving in Northern Ireland, then, probably like you, I would tend towards the Republican route of argument. But if you meet some green-eyed Republican you would do the other. It's a little bit of a Scottish trait, isn't it, a little bit of the argument - in-an-empty-room syndrome. And that's without drink.' He is growing a little uncomfortable. He loves talking about the programme, but hates talking about himself - at least these days, he does. He knows he's good at his job, but doesn't really want to analyse why. There are jokes, deflections, wryness, but no answers. I press on. 'Well... I'm not very good at talking about it. I suppose I was lucky. A good upbringing. Mum [he is adopted] was a psychiatric social worker, Dad was a publisher, and he was the greatest mixer with people, far greater than I was, am; a fantastic communicator and human being. He could talk to anyone, and everyone would talk to him, and if I would aspire to anything... I'm far less of a man than he was. He was far more likeable. He didn't cut his cloth for anyone, he just connected with people and people with him.' So he's given an answer, of sorts, but by talking about someone else. It seems strange, this strong reluctance towards any kind of self-analysis, his wariness of the whole idea of this interview, his self- consciousness in front of the photographer. For this is the man who, it had seemed, had been courting fame all his adult life, with great shouts and waves. The Radio 1 roadshows, the grinning, pancaked Wheel of Fortune days, the college showboating, the arrogance... and then, belatedly, I realise that the answer probably has much to do with this show and the position it has brought him. He calls it 'the most exciting thing I've ever done', and I believe him. The irony here, of course, is that, as soon as he stopped chasing fame with such schoolboy vigour and settled down doing something he knew he was simply very good at, fame, proper fame, with genuine acknowledgement of his talent, came back to knock on his door, clutching, it is said, about \u00a3250,000 a year. The wait for acknowledgment obviously rankles a little. At one point, talking about the reviews the show's getting, he says, 'Well, yeah, but the point is that when I was working hard on Radio 1, writing and writing, and doing it for 10 years, no one from The Observer ever wanted to talk to me. 'Certainly, yes, I used to want to be famous. When I was growing up, when Iain and I were in what you call the Brideshead years - not entirely misplaced - certainly that was the case, right through my twenties and early thirties. But it's kind of gone now. 'What's changed? Well, being happy. Having met Tina. Kids change you incredibly.' He has one young daughter, and his (second) wife, Tina Ritchie, former head of news at Virgin Radio, is expecting another shortly. 'And hitting my late thirties... you're different at 38 than you are at 33. And it changes you as a broadcaster as well. So if I never did another thing on the telly again it wouldn't bother me in the slightest. But, yes, I did have that drive. And it did propel me.' Mention of TV brings us briefly to Newsnight , on which he did a stint as presenter, among some acrimonious internal BBC wrangling over whether he was or wasn't joining, as the 'new Paxman'. He was said to be angry - or, rather, 'friends of Nicky Campbell' were said to be angry - at the fact that, despite his being officially invited across at the highest levels, others tried to play down his appointment as low-key and temporary, and sneered at the game-show years. I suspect he was indeed angry at the time, perhaps righteously so, as the intelligent professional misunderstood and spun against. But he seems remarkably sanguine about it all, blaming it, and that rather mildly, on a cock-up by the BBC's press office. 'Anyway, it was a good week. And I think those people who did have doubts realise that the world's still turning.' Did he harbour an ambition as the next Paxman? 'No. No, really. I'd like to do a TV version of this show. Maybe. But Paxman... no I think Paxman's probably the next Paxman. And the last Paxman. No, now, today, I don't really think there's anything for me to prove.' He's relaxed, supremely so, about not being an actor, despite this having been his main ambition in his twenties - the prime reason he went to his first radio station, Northsound, was to get his Equity card. He thinks back to those days, before local radio, and remembers the irony of the fact he and Iain Glen would derive such pleasure from winding up radio phone-ins with spoof calls. 'On one show, on Radio Forth, there were 12 callers in the hour, and we were eight of them. When I was doing one, being a vet advising on rabies, my mother had it on in the garden and came in to find me saying, \"You must listen to this dreadful man\", and then she saw me on the phone. Yes, quite ironic, doing all that with Iain, that I ended up doing this on radio. And he ended up naked on stage with Nicole Kidman. Bastard.' He's even relaxed, now, about Wheel of Fortune - so much so that he was making self-knowing cracks about tacky game shows on that morning's programme. In the past, I've been a bit embarrassed about it, because people have made me feel embarrassed about it. But it was tremendous fun! And I can't pretend the money wasn't quite good. But there's also a positive legacy from it. I think it makes people want to talk to you a little bit. I was filming with Newsnight , something on the homeless round the back of the Savoy, and we were having problems, they were shouting at us, \"You're no filming here, how'd you like us walking into yer living rooms, now go away, fuck off.\" Then one took one look at me and goes \"Nickaaay!\", and we were in... I think the Newsnight people were a bit taken aback. Also, as I get more mature, I think there's less of a reason to be embarrassed.' The maturity, this new ease, is also, of course, to do with being out of his first marriage and with Tina. His first wife, Linda Larnack, had ME, which he nursed her through. The break-up was acrimonious. He describes it now as probably the worst period of his life (and this as the best), but doesn't want to talk much further. 'I chose as my path silence and I think that's far more dignified - I think it's even a little undignified saying that. But, hey, my friends know the truth and I know the truth, and that's really as much as matters to me. It would be horrible for me to start going, \"Well, let me tell you this, and that, what really happened.\" You may say that's a glib response, but that's as far as I want to go on it. Because, not only was it six years ago, but to an extent it's been vindicated by history.' When did things start to get better again? 'Well, you go through a sort of emotional no-man's-land. I think it was meeting Tina and finding out that - well, you get used to bad situations, like people get used to abusive situations, and, without giving too much away, I suppose I was used to, in a sense, an abusive situation. And you think that that's normality, then when you move on and move out you realise it's not: life can be happy. 'But it's really kind of dull talking about this stuff. You start to sound Californian. I'm not even sure that when I'm on the skids and I write the book I'll do any of this kind of stuff. I mean' - and he leans forward, voice rising, there is still, for a moment, remembered anger here - 'I mean, there's some fucking brilliant stories, some fucking brilliant bits of vindication, but' - and he settles back, and smiles. 'But hey. What's the point?' He's also come to terms, far more easily than many can, with the fact of his adoption. It doesn't seem to be any kind of problem for him. He tracked down his real mother, and that was fine, he says, and that was that, except for a bit of tabloid crap which isn't worth bothering about (I've read it. He's right). But he then starts talking football, and his mother is back in the picture as he muses. 'When I grew up, I had this mad passion for Celtic, the 1967 European Cup triumph and everything, Jock Stein, Dalglish, Lennox - all over my bedroom, it was Celtic, Celtic, Celtic. Then - well, it was untenable, being brought up as a Protestant. Not that it would have bothered my parents, it's just that - well, you'll know, you couldn't do it, it didn't make any sense.

Which made me wonder whether there's a genetic basis for football support. And if so, it leads on, with all this new technology, that - this is the exciting bit - there might well come a time when we can eradicate the Manchester United gene.' Tabloids apart, what makes him angry these days, I wondered; for we seemed to have found ourselves floating in a world of pleasant forgiveness and mature reflection. 'I don't know. Really. And if anything makes me angry these days... well, I can go home, to a lovely, secure family now, whatever happens. Things get me angry within the BBC. The stolid, conservative, conventional approach gets me angry. And some views you hear on the show get you angry. Insane racism, stuff like that, stuff that defies logic. Or racist literature saying go home you Scot. Or wog-lover. But these things annoy any right-minded person, not just me. 'I really don't think there's much. You see, life's different. I'm different.

Which brings me accidentally, neatly to a final question. The coincidence of those two names: the revered communicator and the housewives' favourite. Which of the two, I wonder, would Nicky Campbell, caught somewhere bang in the middle, rather be? 'Melvyn Bragg or Dale Winton? Oh God.' Go on. 'Bragg or Winton. Christ, Euan... I mean, is this shag or die?' He's failed to answer the question, again. But that's fine, in the end. I don't think it was actual evasion, for I don't think that it's a question he could answer. I think now, finally, he's actually quite happy being Nicky Campbell.",

      "body": "<p>Just when you thought the anti-irony trend had peaked, it's had a booster shot in the form of one Jedediah Purdy, a brainy 24-year-old farm boy turned law student from rural Virginia and author of For Common Things: Irony, Trust and Commitment in America Today. Published in the US at the end of last year, the book has reinvigorated the attack on both sides of the Atlantic on what Steve Martin calls the 'ironic virus' in our culture and taken it a quantum step further: in Purdy's argument, it's not enough to be against irony - you have to be for something.</p> <p>What Purdy is for is a New Sincerity. Like his fellow critics, he believes that irony - broadly defined as the smart, smug, double-talk typified by Seinfeld (the show 'about nothing') and epitomised in Wayne and Garth's 'Not!'- is a poison that has left us unable to express real, sincere emotion, and to disbelieve anyone who does. 'The point of irony,' he says, 'is a quiet refusal to believe in the depths of relationships, the sincerity of motivation, or the truth of speech - especially earnest speech.'</p> <p>What he wants is not just an end to a life lived inside quotation marks, but a sincerity revolution - a renewal of our commitment to our communities, a rediscovery of faith in grass-roots politics, and a re-engagement with public life. His ecstatic supporters see Purdy as the saviour of his generation and the embodiment of Hope in The Future (the New York Times described him as 'exuding decency', and were first with the New Sincerity tag), while his detractors, largely from the groovier end of the pundit press, have attacked him as sentimental, naive and condescending.</p> <p>The signs of our own irony overload and hunger for authenticity are equally out there - in the almost painfully sincere work of artists like Tracey Emin and Lars von Trier, in the government we voted in on a wave of optimistic euphoria (New Labour, New Sincerity). Look at how voters across the political spectrum embrace politicians like Ken Livingstone and Clare Short because of their perceived authenticity, a value so rare it transcends their policies, which seem insignificant by comparison.</p> <p>Still, there are those who feel we would do well to avoid chucking out the baby with the bathwater, as it were. The New Sincerity, detractors comment, suggests that we swap believing in nothing for believing in everything - and that would be worse. 'Our disaffection with irony is a swing of the fashion pendulum,' says Alan Morrison at the University of Westminster. 'It's been our dominant, postmodern style of expressing ourselves, which has collapsed into a very glib and limited way of communicating, so the backlash was inevitable.'</p> <p>But the New Sincerity, he says, isn't needed or wanted here. 'It's a dangerous idea, and we have to be very, very wary of it. As the pendulum swings away from irony, we're making the mistake of thinking that the opposite position must be a good one. Purdy wants us all to get committed, but it shouldn't be at the price of our critical faculties. As Iris Murdoch said, \"There's a fine line between sincerity and self-delusion.\"'</p> <p>There's also a common misconception that we're a more ironic nation than America. 'We're not. But we are a more satirical one. This debate has confused definitions of irony and satire, but while we may be sick of one, we need the other, and ought to celebrate it. It's an older tradition in this country, and it gives us a more reflective and robust way of looking at our culture and politics. It's better and healthier than blindly immersing ourselves in them, which is what the New Sincerity is asking us to do.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, the main consequence of Purdy's book has been to simultaneously rekindle the anti-irony movement and ignite the backlash. Like Alan Morrison, Purdy's critics are as offended by his definitions as by his solutions. They have lined up references as diverse as Socrates (who pretended to compliment his inquisitors in order to make fun of them), Kierkegaard ('Irony is a disciplinarian feared only by those who do not know it, but loved by those who do') and Montaigne in defence of irony. They are reclaiming it from Beavis and Butthead as a valuable subversive, and a strategy for undermining power. Plus, irony is funny and cool, and sincerity is dull and can't laugh at itself.</p> <p>It's a dizzying trajectory. The anti-irony trend evolved into the anti-irony mega-trend, which gave birth to the New Sincerity, which morphed into the anti-irony backlash. Purdy's fans and critics both agree that his arguments are idealistic, innocent, old-fashioned and sincere. Where they disagree - and this is what decides which camp you'll follow - is whether those are good qualities or bad ones.</p>",

What he wants is not just an end to a life lived inside quotation marks, but a sincerity revolution - a renewal of our commitment to our communities, a rediscovery of faith in grass-roots politics, and a re-engagement with public life. His ecstatic supporters see Purdy as the saviour of his generation and the embodiment of Hope in The Future (the New York Times described him as 'exuding decency', and were first with the New Sincerity tag), while his detractors, largely from the groovier end of the pundit press, have attacked him as sentimental, naive and condescending. The signs of our own irony overload and hunger for authenticity are equally out there - in the almost painfully sincere work of artists like Tracey Emin and Lars von Trier, in the government we voted in on a wave of optimistic euphoria (New Labour, New Sincerity). Look at how voters across the political spectrum embrace politicians like Ken Livingstone and Clare Short because of their perceived authenticity, a value so rare it transcends their policies, which seem insignificant by comparison. Still, there are those who feel we would do well to avoid chucking out the baby with the bathwater, as it were. The New Sincerity, detractors comment, suggests that we swap believing in nothing for believing in everything - and that would be worse. 'Our disaffection with irony is a swing of the fashion pendulum,' says Alan Morrison at the University of Westminster. 'It's been our dominant, postmodern style of expressing ourselves, which has collapsed into a very glib and limited way of communicating, so the backlash was inevitable.' But the New Sincerity, he says, isn't needed or wanted here. 'It's a dangerous idea, and we have to be very, very wary of it. As the pendulum swings away from irony, we're making the mistake of thinking that the opposite position must be a good one. Purdy wants us all to get committed, but it shouldn't be at the price of our critical faculties. As Iris Murdoch said, \"There's a fine line between sincerity and self-delusion.\"' There's also a common misconception that we're a more ironic nation than America. 'We're not. But we are a more satirical one. This debate has confused definitions of irony and satire, but while we may be sick of one, we need the other, and ought to celebrate it. It's an older tradition in this country, and it gives us a more reflective and robust way of looking at our culture and politics. It's better and healthier than blindly immersing ourselves in them, which is what the New Sincerity is asking us to do.' Meanwhile, the main consequence of Purdy's book has been to simultaneously rekindle the anti-irony movement and ignite the backlash. Like Alan Morrison, Purdy's critics are as offended by his definitions as by his solutions. They have lined up references as diverse as Socrates (who pretended to compliment his inquisitors in order to make fun of them), Kierkegaard ('Irony is a disciplinarian feared only by those who do not know it, but loved by those who do') and Montaigne in defence of irony. They are reclaiming it from Beavis and Butthead as a valuable subversive, and a strategy for undermining power. Plus, irony is funny and cool, and sincerity is dull and can't laugh at itself. It's a dizzying trajectory. The anti-irony trend evolved into the anti-irony mega-trend, which gave birth to the New Sincerity, which morphed into the anti-irony backlash. Purdy's fans and critics both agree that his arguments are idealistic, innocent, old-fashioned and sincere. Where they disagree - and this is what decides which camp you'll follow - is whether those are good qualities or bad ones.",

Excuse me while I have a cup of tea and wait for TT information to download.</p> <p>Aha... it's coming through... First, a PR pitch that bordered on bribery. Lunch at a top London luncherie, accompanied by TT slide show (which I missed, due to perfect timing) and going-home present of dinky designer screwdriver. Only a few select motoring journalists invited: namely, those who also qualify as 'lifestyle' writers. Such as the editor of GQ , a girl from Vogue, me - in fact, anyone who wouldn't be seen dead in a leather blouson talking about torque like it was a turn on. At the lunch, there was chitter chatter about lifestyle things - film, clothes, houses, careers - steered by the PRs in a nonchalant way that suggested that the TT would slot right into such classy flim-flam.

I didn't say it was because I was afraid to leave the TT outside my flat for fear of classy-lifestyle vandalism. At the end of the lunch, we were each given our own personal on-loan TT.</p> <p>Like I said, I took the TT away. Camping. For this, the TT did not prove ideal, as its boot, though deep, was soon struggling to cope with outdoor paraphernalia. Also, my backseat passenger had to fold himself like origami in order not to lose his knees. He emerged at the end of the journey in the shape of, well, a crumpled-up piece of paper. We had to peg him out over a pan of boiling water to get rid of his wrinkles. Also, though the TT cuts quite a dash in the city with its which-way-is-it-going exterior styling - from the side it looks like a flying saucer with skirts - amongst campers, it's not quite the thing. They look far more enviously at VW vans.</p> <p>Still, the drive there was exciting. The TT is certainly nippy and, like most Audis, it's a discreet yet dynamic drive. You can hear the money in the whispering engine. But it's not as exhilarating as the outrageous M Coup\u00e9 (admittedly, it's a good 15 grand cheaper), and there have been some serious problems with its handling. Audi was forced to recall 40,000 TTs to adjust the suspension and to add a rear spoiler to force the car to stick to the road. Several drivers had been in high-speed accidents due to the TT's wild back-end skating on braking corners. Some might say that this problem stems from the TT's take-no-prisoners styling. It looks fantastic, but it has the air of a car that was designed to look fantastic, as opposed to one that was designed to go as fast as possible, as safely as possible (in which case, it would look like an F1 car. Or at least a Nissan Skyline.)</p> <p>We suffered no such problems, however. We enjoyed the drive, though I found the vision restricted. The sternly masculine styling was appreciated by my passengers. The dash refused to curve, there was much riveted metal and everything was black leather.</p> <p>It was on the Sunday morning, though, that we really put the TT through its paces. Someone managed to shut the keys in the boot (no, it wasn't me). A lovely AA man was called, who was forced to spend more than three hours trying to break into the car. He got a coat hanger in and tried to flick the electric windows (no joy; they don't work without the engine being on). He tried to suction the door lock up (nope), pop the bonnet (uh uh), go through the boot (no chance). We stood watching, being useless. The AA man thought for a while. He really didn't want to have to smash glass. In the end, he had to perform some weird reverse electrics which sent the crime-proofing backwards and proved that if you listened in physics class, you'd be better equipped for life.</p> <p>So then, the Audi TT. Over-PRd, over-designed, under-spoilered, over-over-secured. Not ideal for camping trips. There. That wasn't so hard, was it?</p>",

But it's not as exhilarating as the outrageous M Coup\u00e9 (admittedly, it's a good 15 grand cheaper), and there have been some serious problems with its handling. Audi was forced to recall 40,000 TTs to adjust the suspension and to add a rear spoiler to force the car to stick to the road. Several drivers had been in high-speed accidents due to the TT's wild back-end skating on braking corners. Some might say that this problem stems from the TT's take-no-prisoners styling. It looks fantastic, but it has the air of a car that was designed to look fantastic, as opposed to one that was designed to go as fast as possible, as safely as possible (in which case, it would look like an F1 car. Or at least a Nissan Skyline.) We suffered no such problems, however. We enjoyed the drive, though I found the vision restricted. The sternly masculine styling was appreciated by my passengers. The dash refused to curve, there was much riveted metal and everything was black leather. It was on the Sunday morning, though, that we really put the TT through its paces. Someone managed to shut the keys in the boot (no, it wasn't me). A lovely AA man was called, who was forced to spend more than three hours trying to break into the car. He got a coat hanger in and tried to flick the electric windows (no joy; they don't work without the engine being on). He tried to suction the door lock up (nope), pop the bonnet (uh uh), go through the boot (no chance). We stood watching, being useless. The AA man thought for a while. He really didn't want to have to smash glass. In the end, he had to perform some weird reverse electrics which sent the crime-proofing backwards and proved that if you listened in physics class, you'd be better equipped for life. So then, the Audi TT. Over-PRd, over-designed, under-spoilered, over-over-secured. Not ideal for camping trips. There. That wasn't so hard, was it?",

      "body": "<p>As you may remember from my food diary, I adore caffe latte. Coffee, like tea, is a fine drink, but your body can suffer in numerous ways from caffeine toxicity, if you over-consume - that is, drink more than two to three cups a day.</p> <p>Caffeine, an alkaloid, is found naturally in coffee and tea, but is also added to fizzy drinks, such as cola, some sports/energising drinks and supplements such as Pro-plus. The concentration is highest in coffee, but tea and cola's contribution falls only slightly behind. It is impossible to say how much caffeine is present in specific cups of coffee or tea, because it depends on the type used and method of brewing. A cup of espresso may contain as much as 300mg of caffeine, while a cup of instant (the most popular way of drinking coffee in Britain) contains only 75mg. Strangely, filter coffee can contain more caffeine than espresso, because the water remains in contact with the beans for longer. The caffeine content of tea depends principally on the length of time for which it has been brewed, but is likely to be a little less than that of a cup of instant coffee - say 40-50mg. However, the average Briton drinks twice as much tea.</p> <p>When it comes to cola drinks, they contain roughly half as much caffeine for the same volume of tea, and a third of instant coffee. Unfortunately, the majority of consumers are children, which means that, because of their size, children receive a similar dose of caffeine from the same quantity of cola as an adult will from coffee. They can be adversely affected by consuming large amounts of caffeine, and while it is not a cause of hyperactivity, children can become restless, irritable and nervous when they consume more than six cans per day (according to psychiatrists from the US National Institute of Mental Health). On a purely anecdotal level, I have seen numerous children become unsettled by just a couple of cola hits. Dr Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington DC, thinks 'it's crazy to put this kind of substance in drinks consumed by children'.</p> <p>Caffeine also inhibits the absorption of both calcium and iron, two essential growth nutrients for children. Likewise, adults who swallow nutritional supplements with their morning coffee or tea are wasting their time: the caffeine can bind the nutrients in the gut and stop absorption. People who have an increased risk of osteoporosis - such as menopausal women or those on steroids on a long-term basis - should make sure their caffeine intake is well within the recommended level, as their bones need all the help they can get to maintain strength. Equally, people who suffer from iron-deficiency anaemia should keep caffeine intake down and shouldn't accompany iron-rich meals with caffeine - leave at least two hours or so between eating and having a cup of tea or coffee.</p> <p>One of the reasons people over-consume caffeine is because of the stimulating effect it has on the brain. This alkaloid goes for brain receptors designed for adenosine, a natural sedative that tells the body to slow down. By overriding and blocking this normal hormonal reaction, caffeine fools the body into staying in top gear. This is fine on the odd occasion, but on a long-term basis relying on caffeine to keep you going undermines the body's natural ability to feel energetic - and to sleep when it needs to (caffeine is one of the most common causes of sleeplessness). We are mammals that need to sleep and slow down at times (that's when we replenish nutrient reserves, repair body tissues and heal ourselves); if we're disrupting our resting routines, the body will suffer. To avoid disrupted sleep, don't drink caffeine past mid-afternoon if you can help it. There is, after all, plenty of research - both anecdotal and scientific - to suggest that people who consume caffeine regularly experience lowered mood states, headaches and drowsiness when they stop, which would indicate that caffeine is capable of completely undermining your body's natural state of wellbeing.</p> <p>The Institute of Food Research has also found that a relationship exists between caffeine-withdrawal symptoms and drink preference. In other words, it's addictive. If you are reducing your caffeine intake, I suggest you do it gradually to avoid the worst withdrawal effects. But once you've got through the initial headaches, low energy and other cold-turkey symptoms, you will feel much more energetic. Excess caffeine can speed up your heart rate - we all know that fluttering, racing-heart feeling after one espresso too many, or the state of anxiety you sometimes get when you have overdone the tea breaks. For this reason, many cardiologists recommend that people with heart complaints should cut caffeine out altogether.</p> <p>Excess caffeine can also aggravate premenstrual tension and menopausal symptoms, such as flushes, breast tenderness and fluid retention. And it affects the gut in many ways - some good as well as bad. On the negative side, caffeine can irritate the stomach and oesophagus linings, which can in turn aggravate indigestion, hiatus hernias, inflamed ulcers, reflux and other digestive complaints. Further down, caffeine can stimulate the colon and rectum to increase their peristalsis (wave-like movements), which means that if you have a tendency towards diarrhoea and malabsorption it can cause you to lose more nutrients. On the other hand, caffeine may also get a sluggish, constipated bowel going - which is why some people find a coffee hit in the morning helpful.</p> <p>Of course, drinking decaffeinated coffee or tea is always an option. You should be aware, though, that in many cases the process of decaffeination affects the taste adversely and, more worryingly, involves the use of solvents, such as methylene chloride. Although the beans are subsequently steamed (to bring the level of residues below the legal limit), the process does still leave some residues. Unless the packaging actively states that the contents have only been exposed to the water method (not just 'steamed' - it's a misleading term), assume that solvents have been used. I certainly prefer those coffees which have been decaffeinated using the water method - with no exposure to chemicals. One such coffee is Colombian Medellin Excelso, which is available from The Monmouth Coffee Company, 27 Monmouth Street, London WC2 (020 7836 5272), which also does mail order. It sells other delicious coffees which, when drunk in moderation, can be healthy - it's when you overstep the mark that problems can occur.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Since marrying my black wife 18 years ago, becoming a stepfather to her three black children and living in a working-class part of south London, I cannot agree with the assertion of Richard Ellis (News, last week) that race hate is rife in Britain. I can remember only four incidents of racially motivated abuse directed at me or my wife and none within the last five years.</p> <p>I agree that prejudice exists. But if these 'bad apples' are really in a majority, why are they so marginalised? Why have they given up trying to gain power by democratic means and are reduced to the cowardly level of hate-mail and criminal assault. <br><b> Steve Mayes </b><br>London SE26</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Ellis prompted some soul-searching on the nature of racism. Its key feature is an undifferentiated hostility towards individuals solely on the basis of their race or nationality. So it was interesting to read Carol Sarler's piece in the same paper (see letters) where she uses intellectually bankrupt arguments to legitimise generalised hostility to Germans. It just shows that racism can pop up in the most unexpected places. <br><b> John Steadman </b><br>London NW6</p> <p>\u0095 As a black African married to a white Briton, we find we must plot and scheme just to have a normal life for our two children and ourselves. The sad fact is that no matter what strategies we put in place, we know there will be racist name-calling from time to time, not to mention 'jokes' by white family members. At work one is excluded, ignored, subtly reminded 'You do not belong'. In shops I am followed by guards hoping for a bonus for catching a thief.</p> <p>Yes, overt and subtle racist prejudice gnaws at your soul. But I think black people owe it to themselves to do something drastically positive, like starting black friendly banks, fierce networking among themselves and other liberal Britons, and encouraging younger people to aim for the global village. <br><b> Mrs Jessie Davies </b><br>Wychwood, West Sussex</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Ellis is right. One of my neighbours said recently about Stephen Lawrence's father: 'He's making money out of it, just look at his clothes!' What do you say to someone like that? <br><b> Brian O'Gillahin </b><br>Paddock Wood, Kent</p> <p>\u0095 I was recently looking after my toddler grandson who is of mixed race when some friends introduced us to another family, saying what a gorgeous child he is. The other woman observed: 'They usually are, aren't they?' I felt my grandson was being seen as a specimen of something, rather than a lovely baby.<br><b> J.M. Penn-Barwell </b><br>Wimborne, Dorset</p> <p>\u0095 What can one say to Richard Ellis and not sound either like a racist or a 'benign liberal'? I do not know which South Africa he visited.

      "bodyText": "Since marrying my black wife 18 years ago, becoming a stepfather to her three black children and living in a working-class part of south London, I cannot agree with the assertion of Richard Ellis (News, last week) that race hate is rife in Britain. I can remember only four incidents of racially motivated abuse directed at me or my wife and none within the last five years. I agree that prejudice exists. But if these 'bad apples' are really in a majority, why are they so marginalised? Why have they given up trying to gain power by democratic means and are reduced to the cowardly level of hate-mail and criminal assault. Steve Mayes London SE26 \u0095 Richard Ellis prompted some soul-searching on the nature of racism. Its key feature is an undifferentiated hostility towards individuals solely on the basis of their race or nationality. So it was interesting to read Carol Sarler's piece in the same paper (see letters) where she uses intellectually bankrupt arguments to legitimise generalised hostility to Germans. It just shows that racism can pop up in the most unexpected places. John Steadman London NW6 \u0095 As a black African married to a white Briton, we find we must plot and scheme just to have a normal life for our two children and ourselves. The sad fact is that no matter what strategies we put in place, we know there will be racist name-calling from time to time, not to mention 'jokes' by white family members. At work one is excluded, ignored, subtly reminded 'You do not belong'. In shops I am followed by guards hoping for a bonus for catching a thief. Yes, overt and subtle racist prejudice gnaws at your soul. But I think black people owe it to themselves to do something drastically positive, like starting black friendly banks, fierce networking among themselves and other liberal Britons, and encouraging younger people to aim for the global village. Mrs Jessie Davies Wychwood, West Sussex \u0095 Richard Ellis is right. One of my neighbours said recently about Stephen Lawrence's father: 'He's making money out of it, just look at his clothes!' What do you say to someone like that? Brian O'Gillahin Paddock Wood, Kent \u0095 I was recently looking after my toddler grandson who is of mixed race when some friends introduced us to another family, saying what a gorgeous child he is. The other woman observed: 'They usually are, aren't they?' I felt my grandson was being seen as a specimen of something, rather than a lovely baby. J.M. Penn-Barwell Wimborne, Dorset \u0095 What can one say to Richard Ellis and not sound either like a racist or a 'benign liberal'? I do not know which South Africa he visited. In the one I visited at about the same time Xhosa would not mix with Zulu, blacks would not mix with 'coloureds' and the Afrikaners certainly not with the English. Athena Zissimos London NW6 \u0095 Richard Ellis's article made no mention of Jack Straw's Asylum and Immigration Bill. Like a lot of middle-class, overpaid, over-privileged journalists, he puts the blame for racism on the British public. It is and always was those in power who are the instigators. Linda Payne New Ash Green, Kent \u0095 Ellis says he is embarrassed to be white because of racist remarks made by white relatives and the public. Anyone in a mixed-race relationship knows racism cuts both ways - everyone is capable of it. Matthew Kopinski London SE22",

Other prisoners pulled the body out of the hole, and dragged it over the concrete floor and out on to the grass to join a row of other bodies, mostly of women and children.</p> <p>A group of silent villagers stood watching, horrified, in the garden overlooking the sweep of the Western Rift valley and stared in horror as the bodies appeared one by one from the house. A police pathologist, meanwhile, worked near the neighbouring banana plantation, supervising the exhumation of a further 74 bodies from a patch of ground near pit latrines.</p> <p>Several of the corpses had twists of cloth around their necks from where they had been strangled. The skull of a baby had been smashed in. A child had a hole in the side of its leathery body where it had been stabbed. They were all naked and they had all, said police, been killed within the past two months.</p> <p>Among those who watched the exhumation of the former members of the now notorious Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God cult from the house in Rugazi, western Uganda, was Fidelis Tibetumira, a 50-year-old farmer with torn clothes and mud-spattered legs. 'It is God's plan that I am alive. I could have been killed with those people,' he said.</p> <p>On 17 March at least 330 - and perhaps as many as 500 - cult members were burnt to death at the sect's headquarters at Kanungu in a fire which was at first treated as mass suicide and then murder. Some 389 bodies were found buried in the gardens and under the floors of three houses used by the sect.</p> <p>Tibetumira joined the cult in 1989 soon after it was established by Credonia Mwerinde, who claimed to have visions of the Virgin Mary.

      "bodyText": "A barefoot prisoner stood in a pit in the house of Father Dominic Kataribabo and tied a rope around the ankle of a desiccated corpse. Other prisoners pulled the body out of the hole, and dragged it over the concrete floor and out on to the grass to join a row of other bodies, mostly of women and children. A group of silent villagers stood watching, horrified, in the garden overlooking the sweep of the Western Rift valley and stared in horror as the bodies appeared one by one from the house. A police pathologist, meanwhile, worked near the neighbouring banana plantation, supervising the exhumation of a further 74 bodies from a patch of ground near pit latrines. Several of the corpses had twists of cloth around their necks from where they had been strangled. The skull of a baby had been smashed in. A child had a hole in the side of its leathery body where it had been stabbed. They were all naked and they had all, said police, been killed within the past two months. Among those who watched the exhumation of the former members of the now notorious Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God cult from the house in Rugazi, western Uganda, was Fidelis Tibetumira, a 50-year-old farmer with torn clothes and mud-spattered legs. 'It is God's plan that I am alive. I could have been killed with those people,' he said. On 17 March at least 330 - and perhaps as many as 500 - cult members were burnt to death at the sect's headquarters at Kanungu in a fire which was at first treated as mass suicide and then murder. Some 389 bodies were found buried in the gardens and under the floors of three houses used by the sect. Tibetumira joined the cult in 1989 soon after it was established by Credonia Mwerinde, who claimed to have visions of the Virgin Mary. The group was led by a wealthy Catholic businessman, Joseph Kibwetere, who was later referred to as Jesus by his followers. Fidelis, who had grown disillusioned with the Catholic church, sought out Credonia who was then based in Kibwetere's house in nearby Ntungamo district.

Uncomfortably pressed cheek by jowl, regiments of oldies, with the odd youngster thrown in, search through hidebound books as big as paving stones, poring over columns and columns of small print to nail the one entry that may go towards proving their great great grandad was a Wild West outlaw. Or the illegitimate son of a duke. Or a bank clerk in Surrey.</p> <p>The heavy books bang down on the metal shelves. In some areas - births 1870-1880 for example - there is not enough room for all the people's history detectives to work, so they overspill into the quieter nook of births 1837 onwards. The overcrowding is due to the astonishing growth in 'people's history': in the financial year 1996-97, the records centre in Farringdon, central London, saw 80,000 people through its doors. Last year the figure had doubled to 160,000. At the Public Records Office in Kew, 70,000 customers delved through Britain's official files. Last year the number had jumped to 160,000.</p> <p>A handful of people looking up their ancestors are dyed-in-the-wool genealogists - some might call them snobs - like the late Anthony Powell, author of the 12-volume novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, who died last week. He traced his forefathers back to one Rhys the Hoarse who lived from 1169 to 1234. Powell confessed that he and his wife 'absolutely love looking people up. If there were a Burke's Bank Clerks I would buy it'.</p> <p>But most of the enthusiasts for the history boom are just ordinary people who want to get a handle on their grandfathers and great-grandfathers.</p> <p>The 'technology' at the Family Records Centre is antique: thick books, dense with small print. They are indices to the records proper, which are kept in Southport. You look up your relative, establish the year and quarter in which he was, say, born, and pay \u00a36.50 for a certificate with the precise details of birth date and his parents - if you've got the right name. You get the results four days later, and until you have the certificate in your hand you don't know whether you've hit the jackpot or scored a dud.</p> <p>At \u00a36.50 a shot, it's expensive and time consuming. Yet once you start delving into your own past, people say you're hooked. The crowds at the records centre are polite and friendly but there is an air of steely determination. You can almost hear people think: 'I am going to track down Grandfather Noggis if it is the last thing I do.'</p> <p>BT phone engineer James Henebury was having a quick cigarette outside the records centre, a break from hunting down his Irish ancestors, many of whom fled the potato famine to work in the South Wales coalfield in the last century. 'None of them could write. You've got to look for variations in the spelling. My name is Henebury, but in 1881 my great grandfather appears as \"Hanebury\". It is stuff like that that throws you. In the beginning it was so easy. As it gets harder, it gets more interesting. You have to think of different angles.'</p> <p>He took another drag in the cold March air and spoke for dozens of people in the records centre: 'It is compulsive.'</p> <p>The explosion in interest is reflected on the box: Channel 4's Time Team is currently recording its seventh series, and, with three million plus viewers, is the channel's most watched regular factual show. This is some going for a show which involves a handful of odd-bods up to their knees in mud in a field, trowels in hand, truffling around for bits of Roman underwear. Its ever-enthusiastic presenter, Tony Robinson, made his name as Baldrick in Blackadder, a show based on writer Richard Curtis's intuition that English history is a never-ending source of fascination to (and comedy for) the public.</p> <p>One of the Time Team presenters, Mick Aston of Bristol University - the fuzzy-haired prof who favours psychedelic knitwear - said: 'There always has been an intense interest in the past. I have taught in the extra-mural department for 30 years, and people have always come along in classes of 30 or 40.'</p> <p>On BBC2 a whole raft of programmes under the title History 2000 is on air. Breaking the Seal, presented by archivist Bettany Hughes, showed how people could understand something of their ancestors by examining old documents, criminal records and the like. Bloodties, which will return to the screen later this year, features people researching into their past. Presenter Martha Kearney said: 'Everyone is intrigued by their family's history - that's what makes Bloodties so fascinating.'</p> <p>The show features, among others, the story of the executioner. Richard Jeffrey has spent 15 years investigating the life of his great great grandfather, William Calcraft, who was The Hangman of the City of London.</p> <p>The BBC's Michael Greenwood, who commissioned the History 2000 shows, reflected on why history was now good box office: 'There's been a lot of Millennium hype, and when people look to the future you can't help going further back into the past. The Internet has made a huge difference so that the technology is now enabling people to find out who their ancestors were as never before. But much of this is about roots, and people nowadays, with the break-up of the traditional family and moving all over the country, are not secure about their roots. People want to hang on to what stories they do have.'</p> <p>You need legwork, a bit of money and a touch of the Sherlock Holmes to hunt down clues. You also need the imagination to create a Jane Austen costume drama in your head, peopled with your own forefathers. And General Pinochet has helped too. Christopher Connolly of Chesterfield wrote a letter about him to the Guardian. Landscape gardener Michael Connolley read the letter, and, knowing his Irish ancestors moved to the North Derbyshire coalfield, got in touch via Christopher's e-mail address. They were cousins, many times removed.</p> <p>Michael Connolley and his sister Cathy, a nurse, were trawling through the records centre last week. He explained how to surf the Net for your ancestors: 'You might take a look at <a href=\"http://www.genuki.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.genuki.org.uk</a> to start with. From here you can access county surname lists to find others with an interest in your surname. From there you get county maps and photographs, lists of churches, parishes and even free look-ups undertaken by \"kind souls\" who will search for your family details in reference lists. You might also take a look at the pages at <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rootsweb.com</a>.</p> <p>'The Mormons have been collecting genealogy details from all over the world and storing them on their site at <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.familysearch.org</a> - it's always worth searching here for those long-lost relatives.'</p> <p>His partner, Lesley, has traced her family tree back to a man called Piggins in 1572. 'Without the Internet,' she said, 'I'd still be in the 1800s.'</p> <p>Thus the ancient comes alive, thanks to the modern.</p> <p><b>In-laws and outlaws</b></p> <p>The best piece of advice in finding out your family tree is to talk to your older relatives, but after a very short space of time you enter a wilderness of mirrors. Five days after I was told to get cracking on tracing my family tree, I have established - no, sorry, heard wonderful stories - that I am connected to the Kings of Ireland on my father's side and a Wild West outlaw, Charlie Todd, on my mum's.</p> <p>In the Family Records Centre at Farringdon I managed to go back to 1890, and saw the birth entry for my maternal grandfather, Stephen Bennett Owen. He knew how to tickle trout and was a wonderful horseman. The Owens had lived and farmed in the same beautiful farmhouse, Hiraeth, for generations. The farmhouse is demolished now and my grand- father's way of life was too, with the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry, and was gassed, and though he survived he never recovered the blooming health of his youth. He died long before I was born, but it did give me a tingle of empathy when, after four false starts looking in the books for 1886, 1887, 1888 and 1889, I finally found his name.</p> <p>Stephen married my grannie, nee Edith Todd, who became a landlady in Liverpool's Hope Street for the poorly paid actors at the Rep. Years later, I met Richard Briers, who had stayed there, and he smiled and said: 'Oh, yes, Mrs Owen. She cooked our wedding breakfast for us. She was a lovely woman.' Mavis from Coronation Street stayed with gran too.</p> <p>Gran's father, George Todd, emigrated to the States and saw Red Indians 'on the warpath' around the Red River. They turned back. Another of the Todds, Charlie, also went to the States and, they say, started robbing banks.</p> <p>On my dad's side, my grandmother, Amy, who was confusingly nee Owen, came from Shropshire, not far from a lovely hill called, really confusingly, Sweeney Mountain.</p> <p>My grandfather, Herbert Hugh, also fought in the First World War and was gassed. Shockingly, the story goes - and I failed, thus far, to trace him - he was born in Scotland. All my life I have been proud of my Irish ancestry.</p> <p>His father had owned brougham carriages. And another Sweeney was a policeman. Further back, a John Sweeney fought as a sergeant major in the Crimean War, and Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street was, perhaps, an earlier incarnation, making pies out of his enemies' butchered flesh - very much a family tradition. Deep, deep lies the Irish connection, difficult to trace because many of the Irish records were destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising. But, as my dad loves to say, we're related to the Kings of Ireland.</p> <p>One day, with a bit of help from the Family Records Centre, I might prove it.</p>",

A handful of people looking up their ancestors are dyed-in-the-wool genealogists - some might call them snobs - like the late Anthony Powell, author of the 12-volume novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, who died last week. He traced his forefathers back to one Rhys the Hoarse who lived from 1169 to 1234. Powell confessed that he and his wife 'absolutely love looking people up. If there were a Burke's Bank Clerks I would buy it'. But most of the enthusiasts for the history boom are just ordinary people who want to get a handle on their grandfathers and great-grandfathers. The 'technology' at the Family Records Centre is antique: thick books, dense with small print. They are indices to the records proper, which are kept in Southport. You look up your relative, establish the year and quarter in which he was, say, born, and pay \u00a36.50 for a certificate with the precise details of birth date and his parents - if you've got the right name. You get the results four days later, and until you have the certificate in your hand you don't know whether you've hit the jackpot or scored a dud. At \u00a36.50 a shot, it's expensive and time consuming. Yet once you start delving into your own past, people say you're hooked. The crowds at the records centre are polite and friendly but there is an air of steely determination. You can almost hear people think: 'I am going to track down Grandfather Noggis if it is the last thing I do.' BT phone engineer James Henebury was having a quick cigarette outside the records centre, a break from hunting down his Irish ancestors, many of whom fled the potato famine to work in the South Wales coalfield in the last century. 'None of them could write. You've got to look for variations in the spelling. My name is Henebury, but in 1881 my great grandfather appears as \"Hanebury\". It is stuff like that that throws you. In the beginning it was so easy. As it gets harder, it gets more interesting. You have to think of different angles.' He took another drag in the cold March air and spoke for dozens of people in the records centre: 'It is compulsive.' The explosion in interest is reflected on the box: Channel 4's Time Team is currently recording its seventh series, and, with three million plus viewers, is the channel's most watched regular factual show. This is some going for a show which involves a handful of odd-bods up to their knees in mud in a field, trowels in hand, truffling around for bits of Roman underwear. Its ever-enthusiastic presenter, Tony Robinson, made his name as Baldrick in Blackadder, a show based on writer Richard Curtis's intuition that English history is a never-ending source of fascination to (and comedy for) the public. One of the Time Team presenters, Mick Aston of Bristol University - the fuzzy-haired prof who favours psychedelic knitwear - said: 'There always has been an intense interest in the past. I have taught in the extra-mural department for 30 years, and people have always come along in classes of 30 or 40.' On BBC2 a whole raft of programmes under the title History 2000 is on air. Breaking the Seal, presented by archivist Bettany Hughes, showed how people could understand something of their ancestors by examining old documents, criminal records and the like. Bloodties, which will return to the screen later this year, features people researching into their past. Presenter Martha Kearney said: 'Everyone is intrigued by their family's history - that's what makes Bloodties so fascinating.' The show features, among others, the story of the executioner. Richard Jeffrey has spent 15 years investigating the life of his great great grandfather, William Calcraft, who was The Hangman of the City of London. The BBC's Michael Greenwood, who commissioned the History 2000 shows, reflected on why history was now good box office: 'There's been a lot of Millennium hype, and when people look to the future you can't help going further back into the past. The Internet has made a huge difference so that the technology is now enabling people to find out who their ancestors were as never before. But much of this is about roots, and people nowadays, with the break-up of the traditional family and moving all over the country, are not secure about their roots. People want to hang on to what stories they do have.' You need legwork, a bit of money and a touch of the Sherlock Holmes to hunt down clues. You also need the imagination to create a Jane Austen costume drama in your head, peopled with your own forefathers. And General Pinochet has helped too. Christopher Connolly of Chesterfield wrote a letter about him to the Guardian. Landscape gardener Michael Connolley read the letter, and, knowing his Irish ancestors moved to the North Derbyshire coalfield, got in touch via Christopher's e-mail address. They were cousins, many times removed. Michael Connolley and his sister Cathy, a nurse, were trawling through the records centre last week. He explained how to surf the Net for your ancestors: 'You might take a look at www.genuki.org.uk to start with. From here you can access county surname lists to find others with an interest in your surname. From there you get county maps and photographs, lists of churches, parishes and even free look-ups undertaken by \"kind souls\" who will search for your family details in reference lists. You might also take a look at the pages at www.rootsweb.com. 'The Mormons have been collecting genealogy details from all over the world and storing them on their site at www.familysearch.org - it's always worth searching here for those long-lost relatives.' His partner, Lesley, has traced her family tree back to a man called Piggins in 1572. 'Without the Internet,' she said, 'I'd still be in the 1800s.' Thus the ancient comes alive, thanks to the modern. In-laws and outlaws The best piece of advice in finding out your family tree is to talk to your older relatives, but after a very short space of time you enter a wilderness of mirrors. Five days after I was told to get cracking on tracing my family tree, I have established - no, sorry, heard wonderful stories - that I am connected to the Kings of Ireland on my father's side and a Wild West outlaw, Charlie Todd, on my mum's. In the Family Records Centre at Farringdon I managed to go back to 1890, and saw the birth entry for my maternal grandfather, Stephen Bennett Owen. He knew how to tickle trout and was a wonderful horseman. The Owens had lived and farmed in the same beautiful farmhouse, Hiraeth, for generations. The farmhouse is demolished now and my grand- father's way of life was too, with the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry, and was gassed, and though he survived he never recovered the blooming health of his youth. He died long before I was born, but it did give me a tingle of empathy when, after four false starts looking in the books for 1886, 1887, 1888 and 1889, I finally found his name. Stephen married my grannie, nee Edith Todd, who became a landlady in Liverpool's Hope Street for the poorly paid actors at the Rep. Years later, I met Richard Briers, who had stayed there, and he smiled and said: 'Oh, yes, Mrs Owen. She cooked our wedding breakfast for us. She was a lovely woman.' Mavis from Coronation Street stayed with gran too. Gran's father, George Todd, emigrated to the States and saw Red Indians 'on the warpath' around the Red River. They turned back. Another of the Todds, Charlie, also went to the States and, they say, started robbing banks. On my dad's side, my grandmother, Amy, who was confusingly nee Owen, came from Shropshire, not far from a lovely hill called, really confusingly, Sweeney Mountain. My grandfather, Herbert Hugh, also fought in the First World War and was gassed. Shockingly, the story goes - and I failed, thus far, to trace him - he was born in Scotland. All my life I have been proud of my Irish ancestry. His father had owned brougham carriages. And another Sweeney was a policeman. Further back, a John Sweeney fought as a sergeant major in the Crimean War, and Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street was, perhaps, an earlier incarnation, making pies out of his enemies' butchered flesh - very much a family tradition. Deep, deep lies the Irish connection, difficult to trace because many of the Irish records were destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising. But, as my dad loves to say, we're related to the Kings of Ireland. One day, with a bit of help from the Family Records Centre, I might prove it.",

      "body": "<p>When you drive past a church and see a bride and groom emerging, do you wish them all the best and move on? Or do you rattle off the latest divorce statistics and wonder how long it's going to last? This may or may not have been the question that prompted Paul Watson to make A Wedding in the Family. Certainly it was the question on most people's minds last Tuesday when they tuned in to watch it.</p> <p>How did they feel 90 minutes later when Stuart and Anna, the happy couple, finally said their vows?</p> <p>If it seemed to me they were taking a huge, if noble, risk, it was not because I had doubts about them personally. It was because I had such a clear view of the world they were walking into, and because I knew so much about their families. Which was not to say I disapproved of their families. It was just that they were so typical. So much like the rest of us. Although Stuart's parents had been happily married for 36 years, Stuart at 30 was already divorced. While Anna was marrying for the first time, her own parents were both on their second marriages.</p> <p>And while almost everyone observed family loyalties and decorum when speaking to the camera, there was one who appeared to say anything that came into her head. This was Anna's stepmother. By the end we knew how she felt when she slapped her beloved son, and how much she liked a drink. We knew that her husband, a heroic doctor who worked in his spare time for an emergency rescue charity, was a serial adulterer, and that this was why husband and wife lived in separate bedrooms.</p> <p>She was an intriguing character because she contradicted herself - saying one minute that love was not necessary in a marriage and the next minute that she hoped Stuart and Anna would stay in love because otherwise what was the point?</p> <p>The film really did capture our wild hopes and wilder fears about modern families and make them all of a piece. So I'm glad Watson was able to talk the Huttons and Vaughan-Smiths into letting him film them. What's harder to understand is why they agreed. Did they have any idea what they were letting themselves in for?</p> <p>Anna, Stuart and their parents were still looking a little shaky when I went to Iver Heath to ask them on Thursday, two days after the broadcast. No sooner had Jean Hutton asked me if I'd like a crumpet with my tea, than she exclaimed to her husband, 'Oh no, she's going to write we're so Middle England because we have crumpets with our tea!'</p> <p>Although they insisted everything was fine, really, they did admit the documentary was not quite as they'd expected. Anna's original understanding was that Watson 'wanted to make a social comment on the family at the turn of the millennium, using a wedding as a vehicle'. When she saw the ad in the hospital where she works, her first thought was how nice it would be to have a 'keepsake with all our family in it, a memento of what was going on in all their lives at the moment when Stuart and I were getting married'. The others did not warm to the idea as quickly. 'We lead what we like to think of as private lives,' Stuart father's Brian told me. 'Opening our home up to the world is not in our remit.' Jean, Stuart's mother, added. 'And we'd just been through one divorce, with an ex still living around the corner. We wanted the day to be lovely. We didn't want someone coming in and changing the wedding.'</p> <p>Anna's mother thought it was a joke when Anna first mentioned it. The initial response of her father, Steven Vaughan-Smith, was: 'Why do we want to be involved in this?' But he came around after he talked it over with Watson.</p> <p>If this was to be a documentary about core professionals in Middle England, then they had to be the ideal subjects. Anna's father was a doctor, Anna was a nurse, her brother was a teacher, and her mother a social worker. Stuart's father had run a small business all his working life. Stuart worked for a recruitment firm and his sister worked for a Christian charity in Ecuador.</p> <p>In both families there were strong views about the importance of altruism and public service, as well as grave concerns about the future of education, the NHS, the flexible economy and the insecure workplace.</p> <p>Steven in particular believed there were a lot of other people out there who felt the same way as they did. 'One of the problems with the media is that is focuses on the deprived and on those with money, property and influence.</p> <p>'The educated middle-class majority in the middle doesn't get much of a look-in. I agreed to the documentary because I thought we had a tale to tell.'</p> <p>The deciding factor for the rest is that they took a liking to Paul Watson. He spent months getting to know them before he ever took a camera into any of their houses. He was happy for them to see other documentaries he had made, even the ones (like The Dinner Party) that had ended with some subjects claiming to feel betrayed. He made it clear that the end product would be his film and not theirs: they knew he would have total editorial control.</p> <p>They agreed that if any of them had any doubts about where things were going the project would come to a halt then and there. But no doubts ever surfaced because Watson made the whole thing so easy. Most of the time they almost forgot there was a camera. He shot far, far more than he needed - 54 hours for what would end up as a 90-minute film. The thing that began to bother them after the filming was over was that Watson was not able to show them the final cut before it was broadcast.</p> <p>Watson insists he told them this would be the case from the beginning - to submit any film to a 'committee of 12' was a recipe for disaster. He knew this left them feeling vulnerable. All he could do was assure them he had not 'stitched them up'.</p> <p>This got harder and harder for the family to believe once the hacks started arriving on the scene. The one Stuart's parents remember most fondly is the Daily Mail reporter who insisted it could not be possible that they had been faithful to each other for more than 35 years - hadn't one of them had at least one little fling?</p> <p>'My trust in Paul had wavered by now,' Anna said. As it had for the others. When they sat down to watch the film on Tuesday, they were all asking the same question: 'What have we done?' As they watched it, dread turned into relief. It was definitely not the film they would have chosen, but they recognised themselves in it. All of the family members I spoke with agreed it was a brilliant documentary, even if it was a little more embarrassing for some than others.</p> <p>'My wife was very upset by the emphasis that was put on what she said,' Steve told me. 'I think she would say now that some of it was out of context.'</p> <p>By Thursday evening Sue Vaughan-Smith was still lying low so I could not speak to her directly. But Steve told me she'd been surprised and heartened by the feedback she'd been getting. People were coming up to her and saying: 'You were very brave. I've had these experiences, thoughts and feelings, but I've never managed to talk about them, not to my family, not to my doctor, not even to my friend next door.' Steve's understanding of it is that they 'feel proud that somebody has said these things because they see themselves in it'.</p> <p>Steve has had the same response from many patients. Only one had been 'distressed to discover I wasn't perfect'. 'I was worried I had committed professional suicide, but it isn't anything of the sort.' Instead he's even been able to get some positive publicity for Basics, the emergency rescue charity for which he works after hours as a volunteer.</p> <p>And the others? Stuart's parents would say the whole thing was worth it, just for the 20-minute wedding video Watson made for the family. But Stuart was sad that only the unkind things his sister said about him made the final cut. Anna was sad because there was so little space given to her older brother and her aunt.</p> <p>And while her younger brother was not bothered by all the stuff about his parents' sex life, he was mortified that the film showed him in last year's fashions.</p> <p>The main mistake they all made, Stuart thinks, is assuming they could do this film without it affecting them. 'It has affected us. Without it, we might have just bumbled along. It's given us the time to reflect on our life.' While their views about marriage have not changed at all, their view of the other marriages in their family certainly has. 'There is nothing that we didn't know, but we'd never really looked at it before, because it was all hidden.'</p> <p>According to Watson, that is what documentary is all about. You start with a series of clich\u00e9s and then you begin to see that what lies underneath them is worth exploring. You are not digging for dirt but trying to understand the people you have before you. You listen and look and let things happen.</p> <p>Then you go to the cutting room, where your best discoveries are almost accidents - you put two things together and they reveal a hidden context. 'In the end, the rushes have their own organic life. They scream at you.'</p> <p>If what emerges is a revelation to the subjects, it is just as much as a revelation to him. 'I have to contend with many of the same things in my life as they do. As a married man I have made a bit of a balls-up of my life.' So when his subjects talk about their own failures, he is interested because he has failed, too.</p> <p>The temptation to make what he calls 'great television' is always there. People always say more than they should, and there are always one or two who give him enough ammunition for him to ruin their lives. But to include sensational revelations to boost ratings is morally wrong, he believes. He is forever saving subjects from ruination and huge embarrassment by leaving out the juicy bits.</p> <p>This last film was no exception, he tells me: that is one reason why he gets rather tetchy with me when I ask him to comment on what the Huttons and Vaughan-Smiths have said about him. 'I told them from the very beginning - the film is not for you. It's about you. It's for other people, who will see it and find in it parts of themselves.'</p> <p>But he needn't worry. The message got through. It is clear that he spent a great deal of his time with the Huttons and the Vaughan-Smiths telling them things, because now, as they talk about their new views of life on and off the screen, they are forever quoting him.</p> <p>They are aware that the wedding in the documentary is only an interpretation, and that each viewer will interpret this interpretation differently. They know they are not one and the same as the images on the screen. They will never again use the word 'reality' without inverted commas.</p> <p>The main thing that is worrying them right now is their relationship with the man who taught them all this. They consider him a real friend, and they'd like to think they could still pick up the phone and ask him round. But will he even want to come, now that they're no longer his subjects?</p> <p><b>They also dared...</b></p> <p><b> Living with the Enemy</b><br> Fly-on-the-wall series that lionised Dee Dee Dobell, a South Somerset district councillor, and invited her to live with new-age travellers in a camp of 90 run-down vehicles near Brighton. Also introduced earnest young anti-drugs campaigner James Hellyer, to a radical pro-cannabis collective group called Exodus.</p> <p><b> The Dinner Party</b><br> Caused a sensation in 1997 because of the right-wing remarks of the eight guests filmed arguing about the state of Britain during a private dinner party. Two of the guests subsequently called a press conference to say they had been 'stitched up' after hearing of the documentary's content.</p> <p><b> Shopping From Hell</b><br> Often described as the nadir of confessional TV, Shopping From Hell voiced the skewed opinions of minor thieves and shoplifters. In one episode, we met Loretta Miller, a shopaholic with debts of over \u00a310,000 and living in a council flat overflowing with her many, mostly unworn, designer outfits.</p> <p><b> The Real Story of Airtours<br></b> Analysed and reconstructed a mid-flight row involving a family of holidaymakers journeying to the West Indies. Done with all the insight usually attached to documentaries on mass killings, 'The Real Story of Airtours' made air-rage a household name.</p>",

Or do you rattle off the latest divorce statistics and wonder how long it's going to last? This may or may not have been the question that prompted Paul Watson to make A Wedding in the Family. Certainly it was the question on most people's minds last Tuesday when they tuned in to watch it. How did they feel 90 minutes later when Stuart and Anna, the happy couple, finally said their vows? If it seemed to me they were taking a huge, if noble, risk, it was not because I had doubts about them personally. It was because I had such a clear view of the world they were walking into, and because I knew so much about their families. Which was not to say I disapproved of their families. It was just that they were so typical. So much like the rest of us. Although Stuart's parents had been happily married for 36 years, Stuart at 30 was already divorced. While Anna was marrying for the first time, her own parents were both on their second marriages. And while almost everyone observed family loyalties and decorum when speaking to the camera, there was one who appeared to say anything that came into her head. This was Anna's stepmother. By the end we knew how she felt when she slapped her beloved son, and how much she liked a drink. We knew that her husband, a heroic doctor who worked in his spare time for an emergency rescue charity, was a serial adulterer, and that this was why husband and wife lived in separate bedrooms. She was an intriguing character because she contradicted herself - saying one minute that love was not necessary in a marriage and the next minute that she hoped Stuart and Anna would stay in love because otherwise what was the point? The film really did capture our wild hopes and wilder fears about modern families and make them all of a piece. So I'm glad Watson was able to talk the Huttons and Vaughan-Smiths into letting him film them. What's harder to understand is why they agreed. Did they have any idea what they were letting themselves in for? Anna, Stuart and their parents were still looking a little shaky when I went to Iver Heath to ask them on Thursday, two days after the broadcast. No sooner had Jean Hutton asked me if I'd like a crumpet with my tea, than she exclaimed to her husband, 'Oh no, she's going to write we're so Middle England because we have crumpets with our tea!' Although they insisted everything was fine, really, they did admit the documentary was not quite as they'd expected. Anna's original understanding was that Watson 'wanted to make a social comment on the family at the turn of the millennium, using a wedding as a vehicle'. When she saw the ad in the hospital where she works, her first thought was how nice it would be to have a 'keepsake with all our family in it, a memento of what was going on in all their lives at the moment when Stuart and I were getting married'. The others did not warm to the idea as quickly. 'We lead what we like to think of as private lives,' Stuart father's Brian told me. 'Opening our home up to the world is not in our remit.' Jean, Stuart's mother, added. 'And we'd just been through one divorce, with an ex still living around the corner. We wanted the day to be lovely. We didn't want someone coming in and changing the wedding.' Anna's mother thought it was a joke when Anna first mentioned it. The initial response of her father, Steven Vaughan-Smith, was: 'Why do we want to be involved in this?' But he came around after he talked it over with Watson. If this was to be a documentary about core professionals in Middle England, then they had to be the ideal subjects. Anna's father was a doctor, Anna was a nurse, her brother was a teacher, and her mother a social worker. Stuart's father had run a small business all his working life. Stuart worked for a recruitment firm and his sister worked for a Christian charity in Ecuador. In both families there were strong views about the importance of altruism and public service, as well as grave concerns about the future of education, the NHS, the flexible economy and the insecure workplace. Steven in particular believed there were a lot of other people out there who felt the same way as they did. 'One of the problems with the media is that is focuses on the deprived and on those with money, property and influence. 'The educated middle-class majority in the middle doesn't get much of a look-in. I agreed to the documentary because I thought we had a tale to tell.' The deciding factor for the rest is that they took a liking to Paul Watson. He spent months getting to know them before he ever took a camera into any of their houses. He was happy for them to see other documentaries he had made, even the ones (like The Dinner Party) that had ended with some subjects claiming to feel betrayed. He made it clear that the end product would be his film and not theirs: they knew he would have total editorial control. They agreed that if any of them had any doubts about where things were going the project would come to a halt then and there. But no doubts ever surfaced because Watson made the whole thing so easy. Most of the time they almost forgot there was a camera. He shot far, far more than he needed - 54 hours for what would end up as a 90-minute film. The thing that began to bother them after the filming was over was that Watson was not able to show them the final cut before it was broadcast. Watson insists he told them this would be the case from the beginning - to submit any film to a 'committee of 12' was a recipe for disaster. He knew this left them feeling vulnerable. All he could do was assure them he had not 'stitched them up'. This got harder and harder for the family to believe once the hacks started arriving on the scene. The one Stuart's parents remember most fondly is the Daily Mail reporter who insisted it could not be possible that they had been faithful to each other for more than 35 years - hadn't one of them had at least one little fling? 'My trust in Paul had wavered by now,' Anna said. As it had for the others. When they sat down to watch the film on Tuesday, they were all asking the same question: 'What have we done?' As they watched it, dread turned into relief. It was definitely not the film they would have chosen, but they recognised themselves in it. All of the family members I spoke with agreed it was a brilliant documentary, even if it was a little more embarrassing for some than others. 'My wife was very upset by the emphasis that was put on what she said,' Steve told me. 'I think she would say now that some of it was out of context.' By Thursday evening Sue Vaughan-Smith was still lying low so I could not speak to her directly. But Steve told me she'd been surprised and heartened by the feedback she'd been getting. People were coming up to her and saying: 'You were very brave. I've had these experiences, thoughts and feelings, but I've never managed to talk about them, not to my family, not to my doctor, not even to my friend next door.' Steve's understanding of it is that they 'feel proud that somebody has said these things because they see themselves in it'. Steve has had the same response from many patients. Only one had been 'distressed to discover I wasn't perfect'. 'I was worried I had committed professional suicide, but it isn't anything of the sort.' Instead he's even been able to get some positive publicity for Basics, the emergency rescue charity for which he works after hours as a volunteer. And the others? Stuart's parents would say the whole thing was worth it, just for the 20-minute wedding video Watson made for the family. But Stuart was sad that only the unkind things his sister said about him made the final cut. Anna was sad because there was so little space given to her older brother and her aunt. And while her younger brother was not bothered by all the stuff about his parents' sex life, he was mortified that the film showed him in last year's fashions. The main mistake they all made, Stuart thinks, is assuming they could do this film without it affecting them. 'It has affected us. Without it, we might have just bumbled along. It's given us the time to reflect on our life.' While their views about marriage have not changed at all, their view of the other marriages in their family certainly has. 'There is nothing that we didn't know, but we'd never really looked at it before, because it was all hidden.' According to Watson, that is what documentary is all about. You start with a series of clich\u00e9s and then you begin to see that what lies underneath them is worth exploring. You are not digging for dirt but trying to understand the people you have before you. You listen and look and let things happen. Then you go to the cutting room, where your best discoveries are almost accidents - you put two things together and they reveal a hidden context. 'In the end, the rushes have their own organic life. They scream at you.' If what emerges is a revelation to the subjects, it is just as much as a revelation to him. 'I have to contend with many of the same things in my life as they do. As a married man I have made a bit of a balls-up of my life.' So when his subjects talk about their own failures, he is interested because he has failed, too. The temptation to make what he calls 'great television' is always there. People always say more than they should, and there are always one or two who give him enough ammunition for him to ruin their lives. But to include sensational revelations to boost ratings is morally wrong, he believes. He is forever saving subjects from ruination and huge embarrassment by leaving out the juicy bits. This last film was no exception, he tells me: that is one reason why he gets rather tetchy with me when I ask him to comment on what the Huttons and Vaughan-Smiths have said about him. 'I told them from the very beginning - the film is not for you. It's about you. It's for other people, who will see it and find in it parts of themselves.' But he needn't worry. The message got through. It is clear that he spent a great deal of his time with the Huttons and the Vaughan-Smiths telling them things, because now, as they talk about their new views of life on and off the screen, they are forever quoting him. They are aware that the wedding in the documentary is only an interpretation, and that each viewer will interpret this interpretation differently. They know they are not one and the same as the images on the screen. They will never again use the word 'reality' without inverted commas. The main thing that is worrying them right now is their relationship with the man who taught them all this. They consider him a real friend, and they'd like to think they could still pick up the phone and ask him round. But will he even want to come, now that they're no longer his subjects? They also dared... Living with the Enemy Fly-on-the-wall series that lionised Dee Dee Dobell, a South Somerset district councillor, and invited her to live with new-age travellers in a camp of 90 run-down vehicles near Brighton. Also introduced earnest young anti-drugs campaigner James Hellyer, to a radical pro-cannabis collective group called Exodus. The Dinner Party Caused a sensation in 1997 because of the right-wing remarks of the eight guests filmed arguing about the state of Britain during a private dinner party. Two of the guests subsequently called a press conference to say they had been 'stitched up' after hearing of the documentary's content. Shopping From Hell Often described as the nadir of confessional TV, Shopping From Hell voiced the skewed opinions of minor thieves and shoplifters. In one episode, we met Loretta Miller, a shopaholic with debts of over \u00a310,000 and living in a council flat overflowing with her many, mostly unworn, designer outfits. The Real Story of Airtours Analysed and reconstructed a mid-flight row involving a family of holidaymakers journeying to the West Indies. Done with all the insight usually attached to documentaries on mass killings, 'The Real Story of Airtours' made air-rage a household name.",

      "body": "<p>The Conservative Treasury team is beginning to think about how it will change the amount and type of tax we pay if the party wins the next general election. A draft manifesto will be put to the Tory conference in October. </p> <p>Oliver Letwin, Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, says the Tories did not commit themselves earlier because Gordon Brown could have trampled over their policies in his Budget speech last month. But the proposals they take into the election must be endorsed by the membership, and the conference is ideal for this. </p> <p>We know that the Conservatives favour lower taxes. In his pre-Budget speech, leader William Hague said: 'We will commit ourselves to a guaranteed reduction in the tax burden.' </p> <p>They will not yet say, for instance, by how much. Letwin, MP for West Dorset, says: 'Rather than just talking of tax reductions, we're talking of giving more incentives to people to do what William calls, \"the right thing\".' </p> <p>This means encouraging people to give money to charity (Hague claims that lower taxes are morally good because people give away more); helping married couples (perhaps reinstating the married couple's allowance) and encouraging saving. </p> <p>Many ideas are based on the 'Common Sense Revolution' - Hague's listening exercise with ordinary people. Letwin says: 'As well as having a general disposition to reduce taxes, we're concerned to reinstate a recognition of marriage in the tax and benefits system. Just how we do that is something we are thinking of. </p> <p>'A second avenue is trying to give incentives to people who are inclined to make charitable donations. A third principle is the provision of significantly higher incentives to people to save for their old age - and perhaps for a rainy day.' </p> <p>Other sources do not provide much more detail. Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts recently published a pamphlet - 'Browned-Off: What's Wrong with Gordon Brown's Social Policy?' - in which he attacks the current 'system of quite ludicrous complexity'. But he is loath to say what the Tory answers are. He concludes: 'The right way forward for families is to have a robust and simple system. ' </p> <p>Other signs of future policy include the following: </p> <p>\u0095 Hague spoke of the attraction of allowing husband and wife to transfer tax allowances between them, in his 15 March 'moral argument for low taxes' speech. </p> <p>\u0095 He also hinted that 'the level of tax on tobacco and drink' has reached its upper limit since 'many thousands, if not millions, of previously law-abiding citizens' are evading it. </p> <p>\u0095 Portillo questioned the high level of duty on petrol in his Today interview on 22 March. </p> <p>So what do the experts think? 'Doing something about inheritance tax would appeal to Middle England Tory voters,' says Paul Falvey of accountant Grant Thornton. The last Tory Chancellor, Ken Clarke, increased the threshold by 40 per cent above inflation. Falvey expects a new Tory government to raise the threshold - \u00a3234,000 from Thursday - by a similarly large amount. </p> <p>But reinstating the married couple's allowance would be trickier. After all, it was Clarke who whittled it back in 1993. 'That would be a major U-turn,' says Falvey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative Treasury team is beginning to think about how it will change the amount and type of tax we pay if the party wins the next general election. A draft manifesto will be put to the Tory conference in October. Oliver Letwin, Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, says the Tories did not commit themselves earlier because Gordon Brown could have trampled over their policies in his Budget speech last month. But the proposals they take into the election must be endorsed by the membership, and the conference is ideal for this. We know that the Conservatives favour lower taxes. In his pre-Budget speech, leader William Hague said: 'We will commit ourselves to a guaranteed reduction in the tax burden.' They will not yet say, for instance, by how much. Letwin, MP for West Dorset, says: 'Rather than just talking of tax reductions, we're talking of giving more incentives to people to do what William calls, \"the right thing\".' This means encouraging people to give money to charity (Hague claims that lower taxes are morally good because people give away more); helping married couples (perhaps reinstating the married couple's allowance) and encouraging saving. Many ideas are based on the 'Common Sense Revolution' - Hague's listening exercise with ordinary people. Letwin says: 'As well as having a general disposition to reduce taxes, we're concerned to reinstate a recognition of marriage in the tax and benefits system. Just how we do that is something we are thinking of. 'A second avenue is trying to give incentives to people who are inclined to make charitable donations. A third principle is the provision of significantly higher incentives to people to save for their old age - and perhaps for a rainy day.' Other sources do not provide much more detail. Shadow Social Security Secretary David Willetts recently published a pamphlet - 'Browned-Off: What's Wrong with Gordon Brown's Social Policy?' - in which he attacks the current 'system of quite ludicrous complexity'. But he is loath to say what the Tory answers are. He concludes: 'The right way forward for families is to have a robust and simple system. ' Other signs of future policy include the following: \u0095 Hague spoke of the attraction of allowing husband and wife to transfer tax allowances between them, in his 15 March 'moral argument for low taxes' speech. \u0095 He also hinted that 'the level of tax on tobacco and drink' has reached its upper limit since 'many thousands, if not millions, of previously law-abiding citizens' are evading it. \u0095 Portillo questioned the high level of duty on petrol in his Today interview on 22 March. So what do the experts think? 'Doing something about inheritance tax would appeal to Middle England Tory voters,' says Paul Falvey of accountant Grant Thornton. The last Tory Chancellor, Ken Clarke, increased the threshold by 40 per cent above inflation. Falvey expects a new Tory government to raise the threshold - \u00a3234,000 from Thursday - by a similarly large amount. But reinstating the married couple's allowance would be trickier. After all, it was Clarke who whittled it back in 1993. 'That would be a major U-turn,' says Falvey.",

The fund makes a return both from rents and from growth in the properties' value .

The 29 per cent share element of the Norwich portfolio, like other asset-based stocks now, is overdue a revaluation, with some holdings held at a 35 per cent discount to asset value. The combination of returns from rental, capital growth and shares should produce a total return of 8 per cent after costs to the investor, he says. </p> <p>The second argument is diversification: for investors who are nervous about returns from the stock market and bonds, a third source of growth is attractive. </p> <p>But Mark Dampier, head of research at Bristol advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Investors should remember they already have a major property investment: their house.' However, he adds: 'I would be happy with the Norwich fund in a portfolio.

In fact, setting up a syndicate properly, so that winnings will be fairly divided up, is not particularly complicated.

So, in theory, the leader of a syndicate without a written agreement could claim the whole prize and scarper. </p> <p>Camelot also advises that not having an agreement leaves open the risk, albeit a small one, of winners becoming liable for tax. If the syndicate leader should claim a win, but die before the money is paid out, then the Inland Revenue could claim that the winnings were subject to inheritance tax. If the existence of the syndicate can be proven with an agreement, signed by all members and witnessed by a solicitor, the Revenue will back off. </p> <p>Legal cases, all from the past 12 months, highlight some of the problems. </p> <p> \u0095 Last summer, a judge threw out a case brought against Lotte Gunderson by her estranged husband who tried to claim a share of their pub syndicate's \u00a33.6 million win. The husband, Anthony Abrahams, claimed she was paying his weekly \u00a31 contribution on his behalf, as well as her own, following their decision to divorce. The court was told Abrahams told her to 'stick it' when she asked for contributions. Gunderson, 38, was awarded both her own and Abrahams's \u00a3240,000 shares. </p> <p> \u0095 A high court judge found that the friend of a wealthy Chinese businessman who had bought two winning jackpot tickets in the same draw, each worth \u00a31.6 million, was not entitled to half the money. Emile Chouchair claimed he had an oral agreement with Oi Wah Hui that they were equal partners. </p> <p>Key points to bear in mind, according to Camelot, when you draw up your agreement are: </p> <p> \u0095 It should cover the date it was drawn up; the leader's name; each member's name; how the numbers will be selected; and which weekly draws will be entered. </p> <p> \u0095 It should also cover how much each member will pay per draw and their share of any prize; what will happen if a member fails to pay on time; and whether the syndicate will want publicity. </p> <p> \u0095 Keep an up-to-date record of all payments. </p> <p> \u0095 The agreement must be signed and dated by each member. </p> <p> \u0095 If the syndicate changes, a new agreement should be drawn up.</p>",

If the syndicate leader should claim a win, but die before the money is paid out, then the Inland Revenue could claim that the winnings were subject to inheritance tax. If the existence of the syndicate can be proven with an agreement, signed by all members and witnessed by a solicitor, the Revenue will back off. Legal cases, all from the past 12 months, highlight some of the problems. \u0095 Last summer, a judge threw out a case brought against Lotte Gunderson by her estranged husband who tried to claim a share of their pub syndicate's \u00a33.6 million win. The husband, Anthony Abrahams, claimed she was paying his weekly \u00a31 contribution on his behalf, as well as her own, following their decision to divorce. The court was told Abrahams told her to 'stick it' when she asked for contributions. Gunderson, 38, was awarded both her own and Abrahams's \u00a3240,000 shares. \u0095 A high court judge found that the friend of a wealthy Chinese businessman who had bought two winning jackpot tickets in the same draw, each worth \u00a31.6 million, was not entitled to half the money. Emile Chouchair claimed he had an oral agreement with Oi Wah Hui that they were equal partners. Key points to bear in mind, according to Camelot, when you draw up your agreement are: \u0095 It should cover the date it was drawn up; the leader's name; each member's name; how the numbers will be selected; and which weekly draws will be entered. \u0095 It should also cover how much each member will pay per draw and their share of any prize; what will happen if a member fails to pay on time; and whether the syndicate will want publicity. \u0095 Keep an up-to-date record of all payments. \u0095 The agreement must be signed and dated by each member. \u0095 If the syndicate changes, a new agreement should be drawn up.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Graham Harvey </strong> <br><strong> Age:</strong> 32 <br><strong>Lives: </strong>In Llangollen <br><strong>Occupation: </strong>Outdoor education teacher <br><strong>Earns: </strong> \u00a312,000 and accommodation <br><strong>Mortgage: </strong> none <br><strong>Debts: </strong> None <br><strong>Investments: </strong>\u00a33,500 on deposit <br><strong>Pensions: </strong>Teachers' pension scheme <br><strong>Aims: </strong>To plan pension and savings</p> <p>Graham Harvey has unexpectedly found that he can save \u00a3400 a month - but only because he lives and works in a remote part of Wales where he has no opportunities to spend. He teaches at an outdoor education centre and spends most of his time outside. 'We are based in the Vale of Llangollen, just above the Horseshoe Falls and take youngsters caving, climbing, canoeing and mountain walking. We also do problem solving, cross-country skiing, bivouacking, field studies and occasionally more advanced courses for teachers.' </p> <p>The downside is long hours including evenings and weekends. 'When I do have time off, it's usually mid-week when the beaches are quieter but it means having to do things on your own as everyone else is working.' </p> <p>Graham has had numerous jobs. 'Being vice-president of the student union allowed me time to clear some of my student debts and to play rugby for the British Universities.' He was a self-employed teacher and care worker for kids with special needs. 'Being self-employed allowed me to take lots of holiday to develop my surfing and snowboarding skills.' And he has worked as a student liaison officer and special-needs teacher. </p> <p>None of these jobs has paid well. 'I have made hardly any pension contributions, have no property and few possessions.' Apart from a new Smile Internet account, his only financial arrangement is Bupa health insurance. 'I have kept this since I was self-employed. It costs about \u00a336 a month and I have had more out than I have paid in over the past five years.' </p> <p>Now he wants to start planning for the longer term and particularly to make 'some kind of effort on the pension front'. He says: 'I have looked at making AVCs but I am not sure which type would be best for me or whether to take a private pension or look at alternative investments. I don't really need much money at the moment but I am keen eventually to be in a position to settle down and buy a place and have a comfortable retirement.' </p> <p>He recently completed his own tax return and was surprised to get a rebate, which has kindled an interest in his financial affairs. 'But never having had spare cash before now, I am at a bit of a loss as to what to do with it.' He has thought about Isas and shares but admits: 'To be honest, I have not got a clue what to look for.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Janine Starks</strong></p> <p> Contributing more to a pension now is one of the most financially sound decisions Graham can make because the more you save when young, the longer your pension has to grow. His teacher's pension is reasonably generous but he should investigate paying additional contributions (AVCs). </p> <p>If Graham does not plan buying a house for more than five years, he can consider shares but if sooner he should stick to cash-based deposits starting with \u00a33,000 in a cash mini-Isa. Smile pays 7.25 per cent and Portman Building Society 7.3 per cent including bonus. Similarly, Graham needs to decide how much of his \u00a3400 is for long-term saving. He could save \u00a3250 a month in shares and \u00a3150 in a mini cash Isa. </p> <p>Most first-time investors start with UK unit trusts and I suggest Save &amp; Prosper Premier Equity Growth or, for something with a twist, Fidelity Special Situations which invests in companies that are undervalued. </p> <p>In future years, he could venture into European and international funds. I suggest Invesco GT European and Mercury Global Titans. Living in the sticks, Graham would find it convenient to buy an Isa online but, as yet, there are only a few places which provide full online dealing. </p> <p>He should definitely keep up the Bupa cover but should check if it includes protection against work-related accidents. As his job is hazardous, permanent health insurance could be worthwhile although he might have to pay a premium.</p> <p>\u0095 Janine Starks is a financial adviser with Bath-based Chase de Vere. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Julie Lord</strong></p> <p>As your outdoor activities clearly put your life in danger, I suggest you buy income protection and critical illness insurance which pay out if you have an accident. Many of your activities are considered dangerous by insurance companies and they might load the premiums. It is vital that you can look after yourself if you lose your income because of an accident. </p> <p>I suggest you invest the \u00a3400 a month into Isas together with your lump sum. You could put \u00a31,500 into a cash mini-Isa for emergencies with the remaining \u00a32,000 going into something more speculative, unless you need this money in the short term. An investment in the Fidelity managed international fund gives a broad diversified fund for a small amount of money. Aim to do this for the 1999/2000 tax year. </p> <p>With the \u00a3400 a month, you should start a regular contribution Isa in the next tax year. As you will be contributing regularly, you can take more of an investment risk and I suggest a technology fund - Aberdeen Technology or Framlington NetNet fund. This is an aggressive investment strategy which can be changed over the years, either to invest in different funds or a wider range when you have more money. </p> <p>Even though your income and assets are modest, it is important that you do not try to make your own decisions. You can pay a fee of a few hundred pounds for financial advice and then buy investments on the Internet.</p> <p>\u0095 Julie Lord, certified financial planner and managing director of Cavendish Financial Management, Cardiff. </p> <p>\u0095Advice is for guidance only. </p> <p>\u0095Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

He teaches at an outdoor education centre and spends most of his time outside. 'We are based in the Vale of Llangollen, just above the Horseshoe Falls and take youngsters caving, climbing, canoeing and mountain walking. We also do problem solving, cross-country skiing, bivouacking, field studies and occasionally more advanced courses for teachers.' The downside is long hours including evenings and weekends. 'When I do have time off, it's usually mid-week when the beaches are quieter but it means having to do things on your own as everyone else is working.' Graham has had numerous jobs. 'Being vice-president of the student union allowed me time to clear some of my student debts and to play rugby for the British Universities.' He was a self-employed teacher and care worker for kids with special needs. 'Being self-employed allowed me to take lots of holiday to develop my surfing and snowboarding skills.' And he has worked as a student liaison officer and special-needs teacher. None of these jobs has paid well. 'I have made hardly any pension contributions, have no property and few possessions.' Apart from a new Smile Internet account, his only financial arrangement is Bupa health insurance. 'I have kept this since I was self-employed. It costs about \u00a336 a month and I have had more out than I have paid in over the past five years.' Now he wants to start planning for the longer term and particularly to make 'some kind of effort on the pension front'. He says: 'I have looked at making AVCs but I am not sure which type would be best for me or whether to take a private pension or look at alternative investments. I don't really need much money at the moment but I am keen eventually to be in a position to settle down and buy a place and have a comfortable retirement.' He recently completed his own tax return and was surprised to get a rebate, which has kindled an interest in his financial affairs. 'But never having had spare cash before now, I am at a bit of a loss as to what to do with it.' He has thought about Isas and shares but admits: 'To be honest, I have not got a clue what to look for.' Adviser 1: Janine Starks Contributing more to a pension now is one of the most financially sound decisions Graham can make because the more you save when young, the longer your pension has to grow. His teacher's pension is reasonably generous but he should investigate paying additional contributions (AVCs). If Graham does not plan buying a house for more than five years, he can consider shares but if sooner he should stick to cash-based deposits starting with \u00a33,000 in a cash mini-Isa. Smile pays 7.25 per cent and Portman Building Society 7.3 per cent including bonus. Similarly, Graham needs to decide how much of his \u00a3400 is for long-term saving. He could save \u00a3250 a month in shares and \u00a3150 in a mini cash Isa. Most first-time investors start with UK unit trusts and I suggest Save &amp; Prosper Premier Equity Growth or, for something with a twist, Fidelity Special Situations which invests in companies that are undervalued. In future years, he could venture into European and international funds. I suggest Invesco GT European and Mercury Global Titans. Living in the sticks, Graham would find it convenient to buy an Isa online but, as yet, there are only a few places which provide full online dealing. He should definitely keep up the Bupa cover but should check if it includes protection against work-related accidents. As his job is hazardous, permanent health insurance could be worthwhile although he might have to pay a premium. \u0095 Janine Starks is a financial adviser with Bath-based Chase de Vere. Adviser 2: Julie Lord As your outdoor activities clearly put your life in danger, I suggest you buy income protection and critical illness insurance which pay out if you have an accident. Many of your activities are considered dangerous by insurance companies and they might load the premiums. It is vital that you can look after yourself if you lose your income because of an accident. I suggest you invest the \u00a3400 a month into Isas together with your lump sum. You could put \u00a31,500 into a cash mini-Isa for emergencies with the remaining \u00a32,000 going into something more speculative, unless you need this money in the short term. An investment in the Fidelity managed international fund gives a broad diversified fund for a small amount of money. Aim to do this for the 1999/2000 tax year. With the \u00a3400 a month, you should start a regular contribution Isa in the next tax year. As you will be contributing regularly, you can take more of an investment risk and I suggest a technology fund - Aberdeen Technology or Framlington NetNet fund. This is an aggressive investment strategy which can be changed over the years, either to invest in different funds or a wider range when you have more money. Even though your income and assets are modest, it is important that you do not try to make your own decisions. You can pay a fee of a few hundred pounds for financial advice and then buy investments on the Internet. \u0095 Julie Lord, certified financial planner and managing director of Cavendish Financial Management, Cardiff. \u0095Advice is for guidance only. \u0095Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

      "body": "<p>Tony Geering paid \u00a3750 for one table from an antique shop. He then consigned it to Sotheby's where it is expected to fetch \u00a320,000-\u00a330,000 this week. </p> <p>Geering, 36, is a self-taught spotter of Arts and Crafts furniture, the style whose most famous exponent is William Morris. Until the age of 25, Geering was an engineer on oil rigs. He now presides over The Dome, a former Territorial Army drill hall in Southwold, Suffolk, crammed with furniture decorated with flowing foliate designs or with a distinct Oriental look. </p> <p>Up to half the Arts and Crafts furniture sold by Liberty in London has been discovered by Geering - mainly at big antiques fairs and obscure country shops. </p> <p>The \u00a3750 mahogany drop-leaf table, from about 1872, is by the pioneer Arts and Crafts designer E.W. Godwin. It came from a posh antique shop. Geering looks anything but posh. 'I had long hair and jeans, as usual, when I went into the shop,' he recalls. 'The gentleman running it jumped out of his chair when he saw me. Perhaps he thought I was going to rob him. He dropped his spectacles two inches down his nose and followed me round the shop. </p> <p>'The table was described as \"an unrestored Edwardian table\". My heart nearly came out of my mouth. I felt adamantly that it was by Godwin. We lifted an old pot off it and I got a better look. I told the gentleman I liked it. \"That table is \u00a3750, dear boy,\" he said. I told him I'd like to have it. \"And how will you pay for it?\" \"I'd like to pay cash.\"' </p> <p>Geering took out his wad from his back pocket, peeled off 15 \u00a350 notes and carried off the table. </p> <p>'You are the last person I thought would pay cash,' exclaimed the dealer. After recovering his composure, he laughed: 'You can come back any time.' Geering reckons he is now laughing loudest. </p> <p>How did he know the table was by Godwin? 'Its distinguishing feature was the small drop leaves and piano hinges running the length of the flap.' The hinges were typical of the fine craftsmanship of the makers, Collinson and Lock. </p> <p>And the fret pattern of the openwork stretchers had just the kind of airy Anglo-Japanese look that Godwin pioneered. He was well-known as an architect before he started designing furniture and is regarded as a forerunner of the Arts and Crafts Movement of the late nineteenth century, which promoted craftsmanship above mass production. </p> <p>Geering's resolute scruffiness tempts the notion that anyone could make money by beating furniture dealers at their own game. Which is not far from the truth. </p> <p>All you need is time and love. 'I just love what those Romantic, pre-Raphaelite designers and craftsmen were trying to do,' says Geering. </p> <p>'Their endeavour seems to move my whole being. Now, their work seems to find me. Maybe it's because I believe in it. I feel I'm being sent to those lost little shops where I make finds.' </p> <p>Using up shoe-leather is one way in which his time is spent. The Newark International Antiques and Collectors Fair claims to be the biggest of its kind in the world. The two-day event has up to 4,000 exhibitors and is held six times a year at the Newark and Nottingham Showground in Nottinghamshire. Geering walks 10-15 miles a day around the stands. It takes him 10 hours a day. He sleeps overnight in his van. </p> <p>The big London dealers, he reports, do not attend the Newark fair. 'They don't like running around, humping heavy wardrobes.' </p> <p>There was a time when he used to sell, not buy, at Newark. That was after opening a small second-hand shop in Lowestoft, at the age of 24. He sold junk from house clearances. </p> <p>It was a meagre existence. He had given up his \u00a335,000-a-year job on the rigs - 'I wanted to do something I loved,' he says. </p> <p>'At the fair,' he says, 'I always used my eye.' And he did his research, still does. That is the other big expenditure of time. He pores over his 400 illustrated reference books, memorising furniture designs. 'Ninety five per cent of the stuff I buy, I know exactly what it is.' </p> <p>The Godwin table - or, rather, one identical to it - is illustrated in the popular but thorough Nineteenth Century Design by Charlotte Gere and Michael Whiteway (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1993). Unlike Geering's find, the one in the book has brass fittings. It is in the Ellen Terry Memorial Museum at Smallhythe, Kent. Godwin lived with the actress from 1868 to 1874. </p> <p>The only other known example, besides Geering's, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, attributed to Godwin. </p> <p>But the clincher, according to Christopher Parker of Sotheby's, is Godwin's own design sketchbook in the V&amp;A's archive, showing the top two-thirds of an identical drop-leaf table - without brass fittings. Just like Geering's. Godwin furniture is rare. At London auc tions it is fought over. Two Godwin side chairs fetched \u00a343,300 and \u00a340,000, nearly four times estimate, at Christie's last year. </p> <p>It looks like a bull's eye for Geering. But his life as a dealer is not always so sweet. He paid \u00a3220 at Newark this year for a delicate walking stick stand that he thought was by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of whose dining chairs can fetch \u00a3140,000. Some experts raved over it. Others shook their heads. Geering agonised. In the end, no records could be found to authenticate it. His six-figure find evaporated. </p> <p>Then there was the Godwin chair he bought for \u00a375 at Newark when he had a stall there. 'I knew there was something about it,' he says - and so did another dealer. 'This man came back time after time to my stall, offering \u00a3250. He kept saying: \"Tony, you know you're skint, and you'll make a profit, so what's your problem?\". I eventually let him have it for \u00a3375 but I really whinged about it.' Was there a problem? Not for the canny buyer. The chair was a genuine Godwin and Geering heard four years later that it had been sold on for \u00a321,000. </p> <p>These days, he hesitates to pull the same trick on small dealers or 'runners' - who may be as strapped for cash as he used to be. He paid a runner \u00a3700 for a table made by Collier and Plucknett. The man had asked for \u00a3100. Geering knew he could sell it for at least \u00a33,000. </p> <p>'My mother said: \"If it's worth \u00a3100, give them \u00a330, not \u00a310. Then they will talk about it,\" That's part of the reason I came from nothing to where I am today. </p> <p>'I reckon I've got only another 10-15 years in which Arts and Crafts furniture will be coming out of the woodwork. A third generation of owners is dying off and it's coming on to the market for a third time, but with each generation there is less of it. </p> <p>'At the moment, it's still a fantastic bargain. Most of it can be bought for the equivalent of the price it cost to make - \u00a34,500 for a 1900 bedroom suite, for example. </p> <p>'I could do with an extra \u00a3200,000 to invest, before the market explodes in 10-15 years time. Then I'd sell, and spend the rest of my time in the V&amp;A archive.' </p> <p>\u0095 Tony Geering (01502 722 211, Mobile 0966 371 676).

Most of it can be bought for the equivalent of the price it cost to make - \u00a34,500 for a 1900 bedroom suite, for example. 'I could do with an extra \u00a3200,000 to invest, before the market explodes in 10-15 years time. Then I'd sell, and spend the rest of my time in the V&amp;A archive.' \u0095 Tony Geering (01502 722 211, Mobile 0966 371 676). Website: www.dome-art.freeserve.co.uk.

When this happens, discrimination against people on grounds of sexual orientation and marital status will become unacceptable in the eyes of the law. </p> <p>'The effects will be absolutely revolutionary,' says Andrew Belmont of Belmont Hodgson, a London law firm that works mainly for gay clients. He believes that the act will pave the way for cohabiting couples (whether gay or straight) to be treated in a similar way to married couples for inheritance tax, property law, capital gains tax, the adoption of children and many other parts of everyday life. </p> <p>Cohabitees, gay and straight, would get a broad range of benefits - breaks on Inheritance Tax, for instance, better rights if one partner died without drawing up a will and the entitlement to a widow's pension. There would, however, be some disadvantages. At present, for instance, gay partners living together are not regarded as couples by the Benefits Agency and can end up getting more in benefits than a heterosexual couple would qualify for. </p> <p>But change will not happen overnight. It is likely to take several years before the theory of the new law is put into practice. The Act is an importation of Continental law - based on the European Convention on Human Rights. In Continental style, it lists the principles that should apply - for instance, Article 8 of the Convention is quoted verbatim: 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' </p> <p>UK law tends to concern itself far less with the fundamental principles and to be more rule-based and detailed. Government departments - particularly the Inland Revenue and Department of Social Security - are likely to continue to uphold the existing UK laws until they are told differently, either by judges interpreting the Human Rights Act or by their political masters. So, pioneers wanting their new rights under the Act to be asserted will have to lobby politicians or make legal challenges against Revenue and DSS decisions. </p> <p>The Inland Revenue accepts this. A spokeswoman said: 'Any change would require a change to our primary legislation. That would be a decision that Ministers would have to make. But we are aware that there are potential implications. Both Ministers and the Inland Revenue are quite willing to listen to representations.' </p> <p>Belmont believes that it could take 'five or six' years to get the new Act to feed into UK law. He believes that 'conservative' UK judges will probably decide against gay appellants - just as they did on the gay ex-services officers who took the Ministry of Defence through the English courts - right up to the House of Lords. </p> <p>Alastair Logan, a Guildford Four solicitor now practising as a matrimonial specialist in the Logan Partnership, agrees that the Act will ultimately put cohabitees on a similar footing to married couples. He thinks it will take 'not less than 10 years': 'The current law has very badly served people who are in relationships, but are not married,' he says. 'But the battle is still to be fought. The human rights legislation will provide a much-needed impetus to getting the British legal system to change.' </p> <p>Tax expert Mike Warburton, of the accountants Grant Thornton, agrees that the battle could be long and bloody. 'The gay lobby will not win on issues like the inheritance tax treatment for couples because the law says that you have to be married [to be able to avoid tax on the death of the first spouse].' </p> <p>Cohabiting couples should be aware that they will probably, in future, be deemed to be on a similar basis to married couples. They may want to consider using cohabitation contracts, for instance, to make clear how they would divide their assets on death or separation. </p> <p>A problem for the authorities will be in deciding when a cohabitation arrangement takes on the commitment of a marriage. Belmont speculates that the current immigration rules could be a model. These assume that a relationship is bona fide if it has lasted two years.</p>",

The Act is an importation of Continental law - based on the European Convention on Human Rights. In Continental style, it lists the principles that should apply - for instance, Article 8 of the Convention is quoted verbatim: 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' UK law tends to concern itself far less with the fundamental principles and to be more rule-based and detailed. Government departments - particularly the Inland Revenue and Department of Social Security - are likely to continue to uphold the existing UK laws until they are told differently, either by judges interpreting the Human Rights Act or by their political masters. So, pioneers wanting their new rights under the Act to be asserted will have to lobby politicians or make legal challenges against Revenue and DSS decisions. The Inland Revenue accepts this. A spokeswoman said: 'Any change would require a change to our primary legislation. That would be a decision that Ministers would have to make. But we are aware that there are potential implications. Both Ministers and the Inland Revenue are quite willing to listen to representations.' Belmont believes that it could take 'five or six' years to get the new Act to feed into UK law. He believes that 'conservative' UK judges will probably decide against gay appellants - just as they did on the gay ex-services officers who took the Ministry of Defence through the English courts - right up to the House of Lords. Alastair Logan, a Guildford Four solicitor now practising as a matrimonial specialist in the Logan Partnership, agrees that the Act will ultimately put cohabitees on a similar footing to married couples. He thinks it will take 'not less than 10 years': 'The current law has very badly served people who are in relationships, but are not married,' he says. 'But the battle is still to be fought. The human rights legislation will provide a much-needed impetus to getting the British legal system to change.' Tax expert Mike Warburton, of the accountants Grant Thornton, agrees that the battle could be long and bloody. 'The gay lobby will not win on issues like the inheritance tax treatment for couples because the law says that you have to be married [to be able to avoid tax on the death of the first spouse].' Cohabiting couples should be aware that they will probably, in future, be deemed to be on a similar basis to married couples. They may want to consider using cohabitation contracts, for instance, to make clear how they would divide their assets on death or separation. A problem for the authorities will be in deciding when a cohabitation arrangement takes on the commitment of a marriage. Belmont speculates that the current immigration rules could be a model. These assume that a relationship is bona fide if it has lasted two years.",

There is the crisis at British Nuclear Fuels, with dark talk of economic desolation in Cumbria should the company's Sellafield plant be forced to stop reprocessing nuclear fuel. There are deep problems in ship-building, textiles - the list goes on. </p> <p>Last week he, together with TUC general secretary John Monks, the GMB's John Edmonds, Roger Lyons of the MSF and the AEEU's Sir Ken Jackson, met Blair to demand action on manufacturing and yesterday union leaders addressed a mass rally in the West Midlands. But Morris, like his compatriots, is faced with a dilemma: he cannot play the role of King Canute and claim he or the Government has the power to halt forces which seem beyond their control.But neither can he sit back and watch jobs and membership decimated by the ravages of the market. </p> <p>For a man at the centre of this storm, Morris seems relaxed. Partly this may be an illusion created by his deep voice and considered phrases. But some of what he says seems intended to calm nerves rather than jangle them further. </p> <p>He is full of praise for the handling of the economy by his friend and ally Gordon Brown. 'The critical indicators are positive,' he says. 'We have got growth, we have got low inflation, we have got stable prices. Since the general election, employment is rising and unemployment is going down.' </p> <p>Even on the pound, which business and other union leaders are using as a stick to beat the Government with over its attitudes to industry, he says: 'Sterling has two sides. If you are on the export side then you have got a problem, if you are on the import side then you have got a benefit.' </p> <p>But perhaps he makes the point less in magnanimity to Brown and more to get in a dig at public enemy number one. 'For example,' he says, 'BMW imported into the UK 70,000 units last year and they get the benefit of a strong pound.' </p> <p>However, Morris is not pulling punches on what he sees are the big threats to his members. </p> <p>Top of the list of crises is the car industry, with up to 7,000 jobs immediately threatened at Rover's Longbridge plant in Birmingham and a further 4,000 in jeopardy at Ford's Dagenham factory in Essex. But the problem is worse than this, he says. </p> <p>'The estimate is that there are in the West Midlands conurbation approximately 50,000 earning their living in the motor car industry. Unemployment will not be limited to the 8,500 at Longbridge,' he says. </p> <p>'And there is a review that the Ford Motor Company is taking forward of its European operations, and we have concerns and apprehension about the future of one or two of the plants.' </p> <p>Beyond the spectacular recriminations over the handling of Rover's immediate demise, what does Morris think is the long-term cause? Isn't it low productivity? 'I don't think the workers have let themselves down. Throughout the 1980s there was no real investment in skills. The regime for training and skills development was not good, training mechanisms were dismantled and we left it to the market and the private sector.' In short, the UK is still reaping the whirlwind of Thatcherism. </p> <p>The Budget was disappointing, Morris concedes. 'There are disappointments out there - part of it is that what is being constrained is investment.' He says companies which are not investing in workforces or their own plants are buying in components or finished goods at the expense of UK workers. 'Investment in capital projects is a concern, a lot of employers are looking towards exporting jobs.' </p> <p>When pressed, it is clear Morris thinks the Government can do a lot more for manufacturing by helping stimulate sectors such as transport - which received a 'consolation' \u00a3280million in the budget public-spending bonanza. </p> <p>He points to the \u00a37 billion London Underground upgrade as an example of where British raw materials, components and labour benefit directly from government policy. 'One can always look towards infrastructure renewal as part of the aid and assistance for manufacturing,' he says. 'We look forward to the summer's Comprehensive Spending Review.' </p> <p>What happens, he says, will depend on whether the famously prudent Chancellor is prepared to risk running a budget deficit for the cause of spending more on manufacturing. 'There is nothing wrong with running a budget deficit provided it is in the context of investment.' s </p> <p>But while he accepts that much of the misery of manufacturing is caused by the strong pound, Morris says it is also caused by the weakness of the single currency - something over which he has clashed frequently with other union leaders. </p> <p>Morris believes that those such as Edmonds and Jackson who advocate speedy entry into the euro, partly to ease the crisis in manufacturing, are engaged in 'a very dangerous debate'. </p> <p>Jackson said last week that a million jobs could be lost in manufacturing if the pound stays at current levels. He believes one of the benefits of a declaration of speedy entry into the single currency would be to ease pressure on sterling, and help manufacturers. </p> <p>Morris disagrees, saying if the UK joined the euro: 'A million jobs would only be the aperitif to the real cuts.' The Government would have to cut public spending to converge with European interest rates - currently at 3 per cent - causing massive unemployment. 'My union is a union for jobs, not a union for the euro.' </p> <p>Despite his wish not to spread alarm over the manufacturing crisis, Morris believes the issue is central to the Government's concern that it is losing the support of core voters. Here his warning to Brown and Tony Blair is unequivocal. </p> <p>'Manufacturing is very, very important. It is the sector of the economy which represents a significant part of labour's heartland. But the Government seems to have two audiences, Middle England and 'Lower Britain' and they have two messages. There has to be a consistent message.' </p> <p>Unless this message - that the Government cares about its core voters and is not ashamed of taxing more and spending more on public services - growing antipathy among core supporters could translate into electoral problems. </p> <p>'Abstention is always a worry,' says Morris. 'And I think the Government would be shortsighted if it operates on the notion that its core voters have got nowhere to go.' </p> <p><strong>Life of a labour leader</strong></p> <p>William Morris was born in Jamaica in 1938 and moved to Handsworth in Birmingham in 1954, joining an engineering firm in the city that year. </p> <p>Four years later he joined the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), beginning an ascent to the very top of the organisation which took 30 years. He became a shop steward in 1962, and in 1964 was involved in his first industrial dispute - over union recognition. </p> <p>He was elected to the T&amp;G governing body in 1972, and a year later began to work full time for the union, taking a number of internal posts throughout the Seventies and early Eighties. </p> <p>In 1986, he was appointed as deputy general secretary, and in 1991, elected general secretary. Morris served as a member of the Commission for Racial Equality from 1980-87 and spent a year on the BBC advisory board. </p> <p>He currently serves as a member of the court of the Bank of England and on the Royal Commission on the reform of the House of Lords. He also holds several posts with the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, including the joint chairmanship of the National Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Committee. </p> <p>Morris is a widower, his wife Minetta having died in 1990, and lives in Hemel Hempstead. He has two adult sons, Clyde and Gary, and two grandchildren.</p>",

'There are disappointments out there - part of it is that what is being constrained is investment.' He says companies which are not investing in workforces or their own plants are buying in components or finished goods at the expense of UK workers. 'Investment in capital projects is a concern, a lot of employers are looking towards exporting jobs.' When pressed, it is clear Morris thinks the Government can do a lot more for manufacturing by helping stimulate sectors such as transport - which received a 'consolation' \u00a3280million in the budget public-spending bonanza. He points to the \u00a37 billion London Underground upgrade as an example of where British raw materials, components and labour benefit directly from government policy. 'One can always look towards infrastructure renewal as part of the aid and assistance for manufacturing,' he says. 'We look forward to the summer's Comprehensive Spending Review.' What happens, he says, will depend on whether the famously prudent Chancellor is prepared to risk running a budget deficit for the cause of spending more on manufacturing. 'There is nothing wrong with running a budget deficit provided it is in the context of investment.' s But while he accepts that much of the misery of manufacturing is caused by the strong pound, Morris says it is also caused by the weakness of the single currency - something over which he has clashed frequently with other union leaders. Morris believes that those such as Edmonds and Jackson who advocate speedy entry into the euro, partly to ease the crisis in manufacturing, are engaged in 'a very dangerous debate'. Jackson said last week that a million jobs could be lost in manufacturing if the pound stays at current levels. He believes one of the benefits of a declaration of speedy entry into the single currency would be to ease pressure on sterling, and help manufacturers. Morris disagrees, saying if the UK joined the euro: 'A million jobs would only be the aperitif to the real cuts.' The Government would have to cut public spending to converge with European interest rates - currently at 3 per cent - causing massive unemployment. 'My union is a union for jobs, not a union for the euro.' Despite his wish not to spread alarm over the manufacturing crisis, Morris believes the issue is central to the Government's concern that it is losing the support of core voters. Here his warning to Brown and Tony Blair is unequivocal. 'Manufacturing is very, very important. It is the sector of the economy which represents a significant part of labour's heartland. But the Government seems to have two audiences, Middle England and 'Lower Britain' and they have two messages. There has to be a consistent message.' Unless this message - that the Government cares about its core voters and is not ashamed of taxing more and spending more on public services - growing antipathy among core supporters could translate into electoral problems. 'Abstention is always a worry,' says Morris. 'And I think the Government would be shortsighted if it operates on the notion that its core voters have got nowhere to go.' Life of a labour leader William Morris was born in Jamaica in 1938 and moved to Handsworth in Birmingham in 1954, joining an engineering firm in the city that year. Four years later he joined the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), beginning an ascent to the very top of the organisation which took 30 years. He became a shop steward in 1962, and in 1964 was involved in his first industrial dispute - over union recognition. He was elected to the T&amp;G governing body in 1972, and a year later began to work full time for the union, taking a number of internal posts throughout the Seventies and early Eighties. In 1986, he was appointed as deputy general secretary, and in 1991, elected general secretary. Morris served as a member of the Commission for Racial Equality from 1980-87 and spent a year on the BBC advisory board. He currently serves as a member of the court of the Bank of England and on the Royal Commission on the reform of the House of Lords. He also holds several posts with the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, including the joint chairmanship of the National Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Committee. Morris is a widower, his wife Minetta having died in 1990, and lives in Hemel Hempstead. He has two adult sons, Clyde and Gary, and two grandchildren.",

He has now completed the 'listening and learning' and the time has come for a dose of his famous lightning decision-making. </p> <p>That there will be big changes is obvious and, even before the major policy speech he is to deliver tomorrow, the first major casualty of the old regime has been revealed. Colin Browne, the director of corporate affairs, resigned on Friday. </p> <p>At the top of Dyke's agenda is the target of \u00a31 billion efficiency savings over five years that Chris Smith has set in return for agreeing to an above-inflation increase in the licence fee. This comes on top of the \u00a364 million transfer from bureaucracy to programme-making promised by BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland shortly after Dyke's arrival. </p> <p>Dyke will approach the task with relish. From the time of his arrival at TV-am in the early 1980s, he has built a career on finding ways of doing things more cheaply. During a stint at TVS in the late Eighties, he found a bloated organisation carrying layers of middle-managers. They not only cost a fortune but, Dyke thought, actually slowed down decision-making and stifled creativity. Dyke took out the layers and, as a result, TVS produced roughly twice as much revenue per person employed than big ITV companies such as Granada and Thames. He repeated the trick at LWT, downsizing and allowing revenues to flow directly to the bottom-line instead of salary packets. The share price rocketed, making him a multi-millionaire. At Pearson, he was the architect of Channel 5, which manages to get about a quarter of BBC1's audience on one-tenth of the programme budget. </p> <p>Some commentators have suggested that Dyke experienced some sort of 'conversion' to the ways of money-making at LWT after an earlier incarnation as a Labour Party and trade union activist. The reality is that Dyke has always been clever with money. Even as a long-haired student activist in the 1970s he concentrated on the way in which the university catering committee had turned a \u00a326,000 deficit into a \u00a315,000 profit. He persuaded fellow students to pay their rent into a student union fund, amassing \u00a320,000 - a huge sum at today's prices. In the meantime, he spent his grant on developing a terraced house, taking full advantage of a soaring property market and generous local authority renovation grants - at a time when most of his peers were more interested in listening to Jimi Hendrix records. Slightly later as one of the 'workers' in the TV business - a programme-maker at LWT - he negotiated a 75 per cent pay increase, still believed by some to be a world record settlement after a labour dispute. </p> <p>It is likely that Dyke will want to create a 'flat' management system at the BBC, an organisation famed for its hierarchies and gradations in salary and status. He has long believed that the BBC was overstaffed in all departments. As long ago as 1993, Dyke attended a BBC management think-tank and, with characteristic bluntness, told the corporation that it needed to 'hack and hack again' to cut down staff numbers and overheads. He had been through the same process at LWT and claimed the BBC was lagging behind ITV and the satellite and cable operators. </p> <p>More recently Dyke had direct dealings with BBC bureaucracy in his capacity as head of Pearson TV. He wound up a number of joint ventures with the BBC when fellow executives complained that getting a clear-cut decision out of the corporation was 'like swimming through treacle'. Dyke was scathing about the BBC's lack of commercial acumen. He had been amazed to find that one of the contracts included a guaran tee to pay Pearson even if it made no programmes at all. </p> <p>Experiences like these made Dyke hesitate in allowing himself to be put forward for the job of director general. </p> <p>Dyke has already flagged his hatred of external management consultants. The BBC spends as much as \u00a320m on their services and it is likely that there will be huge and immediate cuts. If there is dirty work to be done, he prefers to do it himself. He also likes to take a personal interest in cost-cutting. At his last berth, Pearson TV, executives got used to having even the most modest claim for lunch expenses returned from the accountants department with the phrase 'ever heard of sandwiches?' scrawled in Dyke's own fair hand. </p> <p>But Dyke's financial review will not stop at management. He wants to build a war chest to make the BBC a major player once again in the area of live sport - especially football - and films. His personal intervention in negotiations over radio rights for cricket last month was significant. Dyke authorised a cash bid to prevent the rights going to TalkSport, the Rupert Murdoch-backed rival to BBC Radio Five Live. Dyke said that the cricket deal was 'expensive but well worth the money'. </p> <p>The way it was clinched was significant. Ten years ago, the BBC was still a profoundly federal organisation with the 'barons' of TV, radio and various production departments battling it out for money and influence. Decision-making was painfully slow and compromised. Commercial competitors such as Sky, where Murdoch could throw the whole organisation behind a commercial deal with a 10-minute phone call, ran rings round the BBC. </p> <p>Dyke had experienced the same sort of frustration when, as head of ITV sport, he found it difficult to get the whole network to agree on a commercial strategy. But as head of Pearson TV, Dyke could act independently and take full responsibility for his actions. And he liked it. Pearson's highly profitable multi-million takeover of Grundy Television, makers of Neighbours , was negotiated in a couple of weeks and the deal itself was done at lightning speed - with Dyke flying to JFK airport in New York, signing the papers in the departure lounge and flying back to London on Concorde the same day. </p> <p>If past form is anything to go by, Dyke will centralise power in his own hands, multiplying the spending power he is amassing by applying the crucial factor of rapid and clear decision-making. 'What I really like,' Dyke once confided in a rare moment of self-analysis, 'is getting together with a group of good people and sorting out problems.'

He substituted a weekly breakfast meeting of about 20 senior managers over which he and Bland presided as a sort of comedy double-act, dissolving departmental barriers.

The shares have certainly been given a seesaw ride of late, with its web strategy hardly being given the warmest of welcomes. </p> <p>The market's rationale, however, is hard to fathom. Bar a few hiccups in the US, Emap has been a consistent performer over the years and one of the UK's most innovative publishing houses. Now it plans to spend \u00a3250 million over three years to exploit its brands on the Net and go for e-commerce opportunities. </p> <p>Emap already has e-commerce revenues of \u00a316m, which are forecast to nearly double to \u00a330m this year. So while investors are chasing prices in blue sky Web outfits to the high heavens, they clobber a firm which already has a solid base to work from. It really doesn't make sense. At 1105p, Emap shares stand at a hefty discount to broker Donaldson Lufgren Jenrette's latest target price of 1700p. Deutsche Bank meanwhile values the shares at 1600p. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Sausage sizzles</strong><br> The rise and rise of the grandly titled Global Group seems to have run out of steam so far this year. At 29p, shares in the sausage and meat processor have really just crabbed sideways since we recommended them at 28p last October. </p> <p>Analysts, however, remain enthusiastic. Results last week came in ahead of expectations, with another good year likely this time.

      "bodyText": "Publishing group Emap seems to have been hit by a bout of Internet fatigue. The shares have certainly been given a seesaw ride of late, with its web strategy hardly being given the warmest of welcomes. The market's rationale, however, is hard to fathom. Bar a few hiccups in the US, Emap has been a consistent performer over the years and one of the UK's most innovative publishing houses. Now it plans to spend \u00a3250 million over three years to exploit its brands on the Net and go for e-commerce opportunities. Emap already has e-commerce revenues of \u00a316m, which are forecast to nearly double to \u00a330m this year. So while investors are chasing prices in blue sky Web outfits to the high heavens, they clobber a firm which already has a solid base to work from. It really doesn't make sense. At 1105p, Emap shares stand at a hefty discount to broker Donaldson Lufgren Jenrette's latest target price of 1700p. Deutsche Bank meanwhile values the shares at 1600p. Buy. Sausage sizzles The rise and rise of the grandly titled Global Group seems to have run out of steam so far this year. At 29p, shares in the sausage and meat processor have really just crabbed sideways since we recommended them at 28p last October. Analysts, however, remain enthusiastic. Results last week came in ahead of expectations, with another good year likely this time. We certainly like the prospects for chairman Ken Manley's new Guinness sausages. Broker WestLB Panmure is forecasting profits of \u00a38million this year, up from \u00a36.9m, giving 3.65p of earnings and a price-earnings ratio of just eight times. The recent acquisition of Sims Catering Meats may, indeed, give Global an even bigger boost than the forecasts imply, though the planned sale of the Impact forklift truck operation may be dilutive in the near term. Worth a closer look. Pizza simmers Sticking with food, shares in City Centre Restaurants have been on a downward slide now for the past couple of years. At 55p, the Garfunkels, Deep Pan Pizza and Chiquita's chain now stands near an all-time low. Admittedly underlying profits, announced last week, were flat at \u00a318 million. But the current low rating - seven times forecast earnings - ignores the major restructuring the firm has been through.

Problems at Deep Pan Pizza and the OK Diner roadside restaurants are also now a long way towards being resolved, while the new opening programme is on the up again. The shares will probably mark time near term, but look a sound medium term bet with limited downside. Biotech boost The bounce in biotech stocks, on the back of technomania, has largely passed this column by. So to make up this week we single out Phytopharm as our speculative buy in the sector. At 467p, the shares have slipped from their 685p high on profit-taking over the past fortnight or so. The Cambridge-based firm makes treatments from medicinal plants and is the world leader in its field. It hopes to have two veterinary products, for canine eczema and arthritis, on sale this year and to break even in two years.

Biological or chemical warfare suit? How many do you want? How about a Fast Attack Vehicle currently being trialled in the Middle East? The mini subs look quite useful too. Shoppers can also hire bodyguards, private detectives (skilled in recovering stolen assets) and sniffer dogs. Major credit cards accepted. Invoices sent by a Spymaster-owned company with an anodyne name. </p> <p>And then there is the surveillance and transmitting equipment. Customers can buy bugs that come in wall sockets, ashtrays, clocks, pens - even Teletubbies. It is these devices which Spymaster says are its biggest sellers. The bug market in the UK alone is said to total tens of millions. Spymaster plans on increasing its share of the market. </p> <p>Started nine years ago as a walkie talkie retailer, until recently the store kept a low profile in the belief that an understated image was well suited to the world of covert operations. But a month ago, Spymaster's parent company, Communications and Surveillance Systems, decided to circulate a catalogue, known as the Black Book, detailing all the firms' products and services. </p> <p>'We sent it to every embassy in London and received a 10 per cent response rate in two weeks. We would normally expect a 2 per cent response,' said Lee Marks, a Spymaster director. </p> <p>Overseas' governments are becoming the store's fastest growing market. Five years ago only around 10 per cent of sales went to overseas' governments: today the figure is around three times as high. The company predicts the figure could be as high as 40 per cent in 10 years' time, although predictions are difficult to make. A protracted war means a huge demand for equipment from the world's media, which is why the company maintains a massive inventory. </p> <p>As a result of its new high-profile marketing campaign, Spymaster is soon to start selling its products and services in several new markets including Greece, India, the Philippines and Romania. Further distribution deals are in the pipeline. 'As we become more well known, people take us more seriously. The Black Book is designed to be the bible for the industry,' Marks said. The company is also constructing a website to sell over the Internet, which poses a problem: much of the surveillance equipment sold by Spymaster is illegal in the US, so working out how to ban transatlantic sales will be a key issue. </p> <p>The danger of boosting the company's profile is that every James Bond enthusiast in the UK descends on the store faster than you can say 'Q'. The company says it is keen to distance itself from the gadget end of the market and so sells its catalogue at \u00a330 to the general public. However, anyone who spends \u00a3200 or more in the store gets a full refund. Customers are never asked what they want the equipment for. </p> <p>Despite the rise in interest from overseas governments, companies still represent the surveillance and security industry's biggest market. Currently around 55 per cent of Spymaster's sales are made to firms, many of whom are worried about fraud committed by their employees. Figures suggest corporate fraud costs companies 6 per cent of their annual turnover, but in some cases the consequences can be far worse. </p> <p>'Fraud is now the second most common reason for companies failing,' Marks said. It is estimated that seven out of 10 company frauds are committed by the firm's employees. </p> <p>Numerous high-profile cases involving the bugging of staff suspected of fraud show how popular the practice of internal surveillance is becoming. Last year 49 workers at a Brighton call centre were sacked or suspended for upgrading a computer system to give themselves extra perks. Their actions had been unearthed by a surveillance operation. </p> <p>But rival firms are also increasingly resorting to bugging each other. 'A lot of our work now is coming from companies who want us to carry out counter-veillance issues. They want us to go into a building with specialist equipment to test for illicit frequencies. If we get suspicious we x-ray the walls. It's a growing part of the business,' Marks said. </p> <p>Even the public is starting to get in on the surveillance act. Marks estimates that around 15 per cent of the company's sales go to private individuals. 'The increase in the number of programmes like Police Camera Action that use video footage taken from closed-circuit TV has created new demand,' Marks said. </p> <p>Security and surveillance are becoming ever more prevalent, a trend which bodes well for companies like Spymaster. Statistics are hard to come by: the firms involved are usually reluctant to give too many details for fear of breaking confidentiality agreements. However, a recent Government report which examined proposals for regulation of the private security industry stated: 'Individuals and companies are taking greater steps to protect themselves and their property through the use of security equipment or manned guards. Large organisations, including the Government, are increasingly using outside companies for specialist tasks.' </p> <p>Figures extracted from the British Telecom Business Database suggest there are at least 8,000 companies operating in the private security industry. Statistics unearthed by the Policy Studies Institute reveal that in the mid-1990s, more than 160,000 people were employed in the private security sector which includes equipment firms and retailers, and guards and night-watchmen. Turnover in the industry was estimated at around \u00a3135 million in 1979. This had jumped to \u00a32.1 billion by 1992. The British Security Industry Association says the current turnover of its member companies now totals more than \u00a33.5bn. </p> <p>Obviously labour costs must represent the lion's share of this figure, but as technology becomes increasingly sophisticated the need for manpower will decline. Already there are devices which link surveillance equipment and the Internet, allowing for monitoring from the remotest locations. Prices for this sort of technology are coming down. How long before there is a Spymaster in every city? </p> <p><strong>America shows the way in surveillance</strong></p> <p>If you thought the UK was becoming a big brother society look at the US. There, many stores sell everything from personal bomb detectors to bugging devices. Retailers include the Spy Store - offering the 'world's largest and most varied selection of equipment', Spymaster, the Spy Shop chain, the Spy Equipment Store, 007 Shop and Spooktech. </p> <p>The US has a television programme - Busted Everywhere - that shows material caught by subterfuge. The series, shown on the Fox network, shows videos of people caught on camera doing things they shouldn't be doing in the workplace. Examples are a chef spitting into diner's food and someone photocopying parts of the anatomy. </p> <p>Two Colorado-based companies offer other surveillance services via satellites that make detailed maps of the world. A map costs from $2.75 per square kilometre.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Shareholders have given us this rating to do something with,' said Jim Rose, chief executive of the online auction company <a href=\"http://www.qxl.com\" target=\"_new\">QXL</a>, as he unveiled the purchase of Bidlet, the Swedish online auctioneer. He is certainly making the most of their enthusiasm. Since it sold 28 million shares in its November flotation, QXL has issued about 40 million more - including the 25 million being used to pay for Bidlet - in placings and acquisitions designed to establish it as the leading European online auction house. </p> <p>Yet even after that flurry of paper, only 23 per cent of its shares are available for you and me to buy; the remainder are locked up with founders, original backers and the owners of the various companies that QXL has been snapping up. Rose admits the scarcity could be one of the reasons for the high rating, but believes it is more a reflection of investors' faith that QXL will establish itself as the leading European player. It could already claim that distinction. Bidlet completes a European network that includes all the larger countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. All it now has to prove is that it can make this network a viable business. It has some way to go. </p> <p>At the end of January, it boasted 500,000 registered users, double that at the end of September. Revenues from its auction have also been growing, from \u00a33.6 million in the three months to September to \u00a35.2m in the following quarter. Not all of that is QXL's turnover, however: its take in commissions and profit was \u00a31.5m, about \u00a33 per registered member. </p> <p>Compare that with Boots. Eleven million people hold its Advantage loyalty card, the High Street equivalent of registering online. Sales through its chemist stores in the year to last March were \u00a33.8bn, or \u00a3950m a quarter. That works out at \u00a385 per Advantage card holder. Of course, Boots is not enjoying QXL's exponential growth: Boots will be lucky to see sales grow by 5 per cent a year while the value of QXL's auctions are rising by 40 per cent a quarter. Not, however, its share of the auction proceeds: these actually fell 20 per cent in the three months to December as QXL moved away from buying goods for auction to simply hosting third-party sales. Assuming that is a one-off and its revenues increase by 40 per cent annually it should catch Boots soon after 2010. Investors will just have to hope that the cost of getting those sales - a massive \u00a37.7m in the three months to December - does not carry on increasing at the same rate. </p> <p>On the basis of QXL's share price, the Bidlet acquisition looks a good deal all round. The Swedish shareholders get a price of more than 100 times revenues for the nine months from last April. QXL, on the other hand, adds the equivalent of 40 per cent of its revenues (or matrix, as Rose calls it in Internet-speak) for 15 per cent of the shares. Its speed off the starting block means QXL is already well placed in the consumer market. However, is that market worth QXL's \u00a31.3bn value - roughly a quarter of Boots? Only gamblers should bet on it. </p> <p><strong> Power surge fizzles out</strong><br> Demerging National Power into an international business and a domestic generator would, the company promised last November, help 'realise its full potential' and 'focus on its strategic direction and culture'. It is just as well it did not specifically promise that it would create value as well. </p> <p>Since the demerger was announced, the share price has fallen from 445p to 323p. Now it transpires that the dividend, which the company has already warned will be cut from 28.6p to 15p in the year to March, will be halved again. </p> <p>Panglossian NatPower, of course, prefers not to call it a cut. Rather, it is because the two new companies will formulate their dividend policies in line with their respective industries. That means International Power will not pay one - all its resources will be directed into keeping up with rivals like Bechtel. Mean while, the UK part, npower, will aim for profits about twice the level of dividends, in line with its peers. Extrapolate that to the likely profits of the two new businesses, allowing for the fact that National Power has still to disclose how debt will be allocated, and the market assumes it can afford to pay about 8p a share at most. </p> <p>So if investors' income is expected to fall, will that be compensated by a rising share price? Unlikely, say analysts. Power generators, even those that give themselves trendy lower-case names, are hardly flavour of the month in the stock market. Electricity prices are weak and the generators are about to be investigated by the Competition Commission. International Power is potentially more interesting. Its record, the disaster in Pakistan notwithstanding, is reasonable, although it will take some years to demonstrate that it can expand profitably without accidents. It could also attract bid attention. It is, however, difficult to see what could push the price above the current level - and when investors realise the threat to the dividend, it could fall still further. </p> <p><strong> Sweet and sour</strong><br> What can Tate &amp; Lyle do to re-establish itself as a credible business? Last November, chairman Sir David Lees said there were 'good grounds for optimism' and gave a more upbeat presentation than had been seen for years. Five months later, he was back with a warning that the US sugar market has 'deteriorated significantly' and profits for the six months to 25 March will be 'somewhat below' the \u00a393m achieved in the same period last year. </p> <p>Lees deserves some sympathy. Sugar is a commodity product and Tate &amp; Lyle has no more chance of controlling its supply and price level than any of its rivals. A bumper harvest coupled with a flood of imports from Mexico have pushed prices lower and Tate can do little other than accept that or get out. </p> <p>That Tate is contemplating the latter shows just how bad the situation has become. Unfortunately for investors, its chances of finding a buyer who would take it off its hands for a good price are slim. </p> <p>Elsewhere, however, Lees has much to prove. The group remains committed to Staley, its sweeteners business, but its lack of power to force through price rises this year suggests that it, too, is fast becoming a commodity business. </p> <p>The group does allude to \u00a390m of disposals, which should cut the heavy borrowings that have always dogged it. Lees still has to demonstrate he can make a decent return on the investment that is left. This year's profits, estimated by analysts at \u00a3200m, will be back where they were in 1989. Lees has so far given no clear evidence that he can improve on that.</p>",

'It's really annoying all this flak I'm getting about asset-stripping. Lord Hanson made a living out of it for 30 years,' Green told The Observer last week. 'But it looks as if there's no one else out there now. It's just me.' </p> <p>Well, perhaps not.

But Osmond has yet to go the whole hog and tilt at the likes of Whitbread or Scottish &amp; Newcastle - whose shares have slumped 40 and 35 per cent respectively in the past year.

'But the City's valuations are a frustration when share options motivating your executives are now pretty much all under water.' </p> <p>So what about the next generation, the sons and daughters who may have picked up a tip or two, as well as a fortune, from daddy on their corporate adventures. Well, there are easier pickings to be had from technomania: 'At the moment, there aren't many opportunities to make real money the old ways any more,' said public relations veteran John Coyle, doyen of many a takeover battle.

Since his father hung up his takeover code in 1997, Hanson Jnr has gone into partnership with two Californian investment outfits to form Millennium Hanson Internet Partners.

Cisco, the company that dominates the market for the routers (high-speed switches) that pass the Internet's data packets around the globe, overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable company. It's hard to imagine two more dissimilar outfits.

      "body": "<p>Why might Microsoft wish to lure Symbian's executive vice-president, Juha Christensen, to take charge of sales and marketing for its wireless business? </p> <p>And is UK technology darling Psion really capable of increasing market share - squeezed as it is against Microsoft, Casio and Palm Computing - in what will soon become the biggest consumer technology battlefield of all? The stock market certainly has its doubts about Psion - its share price has fallen from a high of 7,500p to 3,869p. </p> <p>The speed of digital inno vation now exceeds the time required for us to become familiar or even comfortable with the technology. More than 25 million homes in Western Europe have Internet access compared with just half that number in the previous year. This figure is predicted to rise to more than 60 million homes - 45 per cent of Western European households - within the next four years. In the UK about 17 per cent of homes have it and even the most conservative estimates have this doubling in the next 18 months. Indeed, the Swedish mobile phone manufacturer Ericsson estimates 600 million people worldwide will access the Web through next-generation cellular devices in 2004, leaving the familiar personal computer far behind as the preferred platform for Internet access. </p> <p>Enter 'Digital Convergence'. A fashionable expression among the 'Dot Coms' and the proud owners of first-generation (WAP) Internet phones but one that falls short of illustrating the true meaning of the technology wave that is about to fall upon society. </p> <p>This wave will very soon overwhelm and transform social institutions, business and government on a scale that is difficult even for experts to measure. Driven by a new generation of personal devices, the Digital Age will have an impact that makes the personal computer revolution of the Eighties appear like a passing ripple. </p> <p>Gordon Moore's 'law' of computing declares that processor power doubles every 18 months. The evidence for this is most visible on the desktop and in the current generation of powerful home computers. But 'Moore's Law' is a little ancient now and is in need of retouching to better reflect the arrival of the Internet Age. If processor power is doubling every 18 months, then it can be argued that both bandwidth and data storage are even more elastic and are doubling in capacity every 12 months. </p> <p>So tomorrow's true technology challenge is a surprising one. Indeed, will the next generation of desktop and personal devices be able to handle the flood of digital information, video, telephony and music that will be thrown at them and their consumer owners by the end of 2003? </p> <p>The value of the technology is demonstrated by companies, such as Psion, appearing in the FTSE for the first time and the astronomical valuations surrounding the likes of Vodaphone, Palm, Nokia and other wireless, bandwidth and hardware platform providers. </p> <p>Perhaps you've just become comfortable with the mobile telephone, a PlayStation and a home computer with its e-mail and Internet access. Currently, these items represent separate costs and different devices. Indeed, the price of the digital lifestyle still remains outside the means of the great majority, reinforcing the concept of a 'Digital Divide' - an expression that has now found a place on the political agenda, through the ambitious government objective of 'digital suffrage' by 2005. </p> <p>The PC as we know it is close to death. Very soon, personal computing will cease to be a concept that we uniquely associate with a box on the desk. The arrival of large, consumer electronics companies, such as Casio, in the PC space will very soon and very rapidly change the way we relate to the wired or, indeed, wireless world. Today, two companies dominate the desktop: Microsoft and Intel.

      "bodyText": "Why might Microsoft wish to lure Symbian's executive vice-president, Juha Christensen, to take charge of sales and marketing for its wireless business? And is UK technology darling Psion really capable of increasing market share - squeezed as it is against Microsoft, Casio and Palm Computing - in what will soon become the biggest consumer technology battlefield of all? The stock market certainly has its doubts about Psion - its share price has fallen from a high of 7,500p to 3,869p. The speed of digital inno vation now exceeds the time required for us to become familiar or even comfortable with the technology. More than 25 million homes in Western Europe have Internet access compared with just half that number in the previous year. This figure is predicted to rise to more than 60 million homes - 45 per cent of Western European households - within the next four years. In the UK about 17 per cent of homes have it and even the most conservative estimates have this doubling in the next 18 months. Indeed, the Swedish mobile phone manufacturer Ericsson estimates 600 million people worldwide will access the Web through next-generation cellular devices in 2004, leaving the familiar personal computer far behind as the preferred platform for Internet access. Enter 'Digital Convergence'. A fashionable expression among the 'Dot Coms' and the proud owners of first-generation (WAP) Internet phones but one that falls short of illustrating the true meaning of the technology wave that is about to fall upon society. This wave will very soon overwhelm and transform social institutions, business and government on a scale that is difficult even for experts to measure. Driven by a new generation of personal devices, the Digital Age will have an impact that makes the personal computer revolution of the Eighties appear like a passing ripple. Gordon Moore's 'law' of computing declares that processor power doubles every 18 months. The evidence for this is most visible on the desktop and in the current generation of powerful home computers. But 'Moore's Law' is a little ancient now and is in need of retouching to better reflect the arrival of the Internet Age. If processor power is doubling every 18 months, then it can be argued that both bandwidth and data storage are even more elastic and are doubling in capacity every 12 months. So tomorrow's true technology challenge is a surprising one. Indeed, will the next generation of desktop and personal devices be able to handle the flood of digital information, video, telephony and music that will be thrown at them and their consumer owners by the end of 2003? The value of the technology is demonstrated by companies, such as Psion, appearing in the FTSE for the first time and the astronomical valuations surrounding the likes of Vodaphone, Palm, Nokia and other wireless, bandwidth and hardware platform providers. Perhaps you've just become comfortable with the mobile telephone, a PlayStation and a home computer with its e-mail and Internet access. Currently, these items represent separate costs and different devices. Indeed, the price of the digital lifestyle still remains outside the means of the great majority, reinforcing the concept of a 'Digital Divide' - an expression that has now found a place on the political agenda, through the ambitious government objective of 'digital suffrage' by 2005. The PC as we know it is close to death. Very soon, personal computing will cease to be a concept that we uniquely associate with a box on the desk. The arrival of large, consumer electronics companies, such as Casio, in the PC space will very soon and very rapidly change the way we relate to the wired or, indeed, wireless world. Today, two companies dominate the desktop: Microsoft and Intel. Tomorrow may not be much different, regardless of the efforts of companies such as Nokia and Psion to build a new status quo. The world of the digital mobile phone will very soon converge with that of the PDA (the Personal Digital Assistant). Visit any electronics retailer and you will see the latest Nokia cellular phone and MP3 music players and cameras alongside PDAs from Psion, Palm, Casio, Compaq and others.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Pride and Perjury</strong><br>Jonathan Aitken<br>HarperCollins \u00a319.99, pp392<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502322085,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>God has been speaking to Jonathan Aitken lately, as we read in these truly amazing memoirs of the Tory Cabinet Minister and perjurer. The former jailbird, as he confided to David Frost on television the other day, now believes he is 'doing God's will' . </p> <p>The instructions Aitken receives from his supernatural voices are fascinating, not only for what they show about the character of the author, but also for the unusual insight provided into the tastes and preferences of the Almighty.</p> <p>What does God want? He wants to stop Aitken's watch. The deity visits him, walking on Sandwich beach in the dark night of his soul and, there and then, stops his automatic-winding platinum Rolex at precisely 3.50pm. Aitken describes this event as 'inexplicable'. The watch, worth thousands, may have been one of many given to Aitken by the Saudis who provided him with so much loot over the years, although the author does not mention this. </p> <p>God also dislikes ties. His will is evidently for Aitken to pose nowadays - both on the book jacket and on his promotional TV slots - in a suit with an open-necked shirt. This shows his new carelessness about material things. </p> <p>God wants the author to smile and dimple and speak winningly, in humble tones: 'Having made the commitment to God, I look forward to following him... with trust, hope and joyful acceptance.' God wants him to learn from Chuck Colson, the former Nixon aide, who went to jail over Watergate and appears on the scene in London full of advice about how to turn a criminal past into a religious career opportunity. </p> <p>God does also seem to want Aitken to carry on telling the kind of tall stories which got him into such trouble in the first place. He insists in this volume, against all the evidence, that he merely travelled secretly to the Ritz hotel in Paris and lied to his own Prime Minister about it, in order to have a nice chat about government-to-government defence contracts with his business associates - the Saudi princeling, Mohammed, and his Lebanese fixer, Said Ayas. </p> <p>God also wants Aitken to attempt to mislead his creditors, for not a word of contrition appears here in these spiritual texts for the divorce settlement, dubious liabilities, declaration of bankruptcy and spiriting away of assets, which have so far enabled him not to pay a penny of his \u00a32 million debts. </p> <p>God wants Aitken to advertise his thoughts of suicide, his religious conversion, his grief, his glory, his tears: 'The young tax barrister in our group whispered into my ear that he was praying hard... I began to cry... letting out not a trickle, but a torrent of tears.' When his watch stopped, 'tears began to trickle down my cheeks'. </p> <p>But Aitken's theology does seem a bit muddled. As his memoirs plunge stagily on, it turns out that it is not in fact Jonathan who is a bad and evil person so much as those who opposed him. He gets his new chums to have public prayer sessions for the forgiveness of 'the editor of the Guardian and his journalists... Alan Rusbridger, David Leigh, Peter Preston'. He quotes his wife Lolicia's characterisation of us all: 'You poked the dark forces. You were a fool to think you could beat them.' </p> <p>Aitken even accused me - before his lawyers made him take it out of the manuscript - of practising voodoo against him. Had he studied his Bible more closely, it would have put him straight.

      "bodyText": "Pride and Perjury Jonathan Aitken HarperCollins \u00a319.99, pp392 Buy it at BOL God has been speaking to Jonathan Aitken lately, as we read in these truly amazing memoirs of the Tory Cabinet Minister and perjurer. The former jailbird, as he confided to David Frost on television the other day, now believes he is 'doing God's will' . The instructions Aitken receives from his supernatural voices are fascinating, not only for what they show about the character of the author, but also for the unusual insight provided into the tastes and preferences of the Almighty. What does God want? He wants to stop Aitken's watch. The deity visits him, walking on Sandwich beach in the dark night of his soul and, there and then, stops his automatic-winding platinum Rolex at precisely 3.50pm. Aitken describes this event as 'inexplicable'. The watch, worth thousands, may have been one of many given to Aitken by the Saudis who provided him with so much loot over the years, although the author does not mention this. God also dislikes ties. His will is evidently for Aitken to pose nowadays - both on the book jacket and on his promotional TV slots - in a suit with an open-necked shirt. This shows his new carelessness about material things. God wants the author to smile and dimple and speak winningly, in humble tones: 'Having made the commitment to God, I look forward to following him... with trust, hope and joyful acceptance.' God wants him to learn from Chuck Colson, the former Nixon aide, who went to jail over Watergate and appears on the scene in London full of advice about how to turn a criminal past into a religious career opportunity. God does also seem to want Aitken to carry on telling the kind of tall stories which got him into such trouble in the first place. He insists in this volume, against all the evidence, that he merely travelled secretly to the Ritz hotel in Paris and lied to his own Prime Minister about it, in order to have a nice chat about government-to-government defence contracts with his business associates - the Saudi princeling, Mohammed, and his Lebanese fixer, Said Ayas. God also wants Aitken to attempt to mislead his creditors, for not a word of contrition appears here in these spiritual texts for the divorce settlement, dubious liabilities, declaration of bankruptcy and spiriting away of assets, which have so far enabled him not to pay a penny of his \u00a32 million debts. God wants Aitken to advertise his thoughts of suicide, his religious conversion, his grief, his glory, his tears: 'The young tax barrister in our group whispered into my ear that he was praying hard... I began to cry... letting out not a trickle, but a torrent of tears.' When his watch stopped, 'tears began to trickle down my cheeks'. But Aitken's theology does seem a bit muddled. As his memoirs plunge stagily on, it turns out that it is not in fact Jonathan who is a bad and evil person so much as those who opposed him. He gets his new chums to have public prayer sessions for the forgiveness of 'the editor of the Guardian and his journalists... Alan Rusbridger, David Leigh, Peter Preston'. He quotes his wife Lolicia's characterisation of us all: 'You poked the dark forces. You were a fool to think you could beat them.' Aitken even accused me - before his lawyers made him take it out of the manuscript - of practising voodoo against him. Had he studied his Bible more closely, it would have put him straight. The forces of darkness don't practise voodoo and stick pins in dolls - they smile, equivocate and speak in double language. Aitken may have made a terrible mistake about the nature of his supernatural instructions. On this evidence, it is not God who has taken him over and is speaking through him, but the forked tongue of someone - or something else - altogether. If his religion is a true one, then when that old rogue Aitken snuffs it, he could find himself in hotter water - and in a hotter place - than he had ever imagined.",

We still don't have the journals of her last two years, one of which disappeared and one of which Ted Hughes, by his own account, destroyed shortly after her death: 'I did not want her children to have to read it [in those days I regarded forgetfulness as essential to survival].' </p> <p>Not surprisingly, given this history, the publication of the surviving journals is being heralded as an event of some literary significance, Plath speaking without interference in her own voice. But although Plath was desperate to be published (that despair is a constant refrain in these pages), and no diarist writes without an invisible audience, of all Plath's writing, these are the ones which were never intended for publication. </p> <p>When she was not winding her life into these diaries, Plath spent most of her time busily and determinedly transmuting their contents back out the other way into her art. Reading them, we become eavesdroppers.

      "bodyText": "The Journals of Sylvia Plath Edited by Karen V Kulkil Faber \u00a330, pp1008 Buy it at BOL The Journals of Sylvia Plath, never published in England before, released in a heavily censored version in 1982 in the States, with, as the editor then put it, their 'intimacies' and 'nasty bits' removed, appear here more or less complete for the first time. We still don't have the journals of her last two years, one of which disappeared and one of which Ted Hughes, by his own account, destroyed shortly after her death: 'I did not want her children to have to read it [in those days I regarded forgetfulness as essential to survival].' Not surprisingly, given this history, the publication of the surviving journals is being heralded as an event of some literary significance, Plath speaking without interference in her own voice. But although Plath was desperate to be published (that despair is a constant refrain in these pages), and no diarist writes without an invisible audience, of all Plath's writing, these are the ones which were never intended for publication. When she was not winding her life into these diaries, Plath spent most of her time busily and determinedly transmuting their contents back out the other way into her art. Reading them, we become eavesdroppers. Given the intensity and rawness of the writing, at moments it feels like walking straight into someone else's dream. It is however, I think, a mistake to see these journals as giving us access to some new or previously hidden 'truth' about Plath. One way of rendering herself in writing, they offer, in fact, no solutions to previous mysteries, no definitive answers to the questions which, with an interest bordering on, indeed, crossing over into, the obsessive her life has so often provoked. Plath appears here as someone with, in her own early phrase, 'so many little lives': 'My writing, my desire to be many lives.' Many little lives, not like the proverbial nine lives of the cat, although her first failed suicide and eventual death too obviously invite that comparison, but as something she could use her writing to be, a way of ceaselessly shifting herself across different psychic territories, across different and often contradictory ways of experiencing herself. If the journals are cause for celebration, it might be, bizarrely, because evidence can be found within them to support every single theory that has ever been produced about Sylvia Plath - the never recovered child of the dead father, the woman oppressed by the small, suffering psychic landscape of her mother, the woman trapped in a domestic life unredeemed by a feminism which arrived too late on the scene, the woman nursed by her husband out of pain into burgeoning creativity, the woman betrayed. They are all here. With each one so vividly and insistently present, and each one just as immediately countered by the energetic presence of another, it becomes clear that none of them, that is, none of them on their own, will, in fact, do.

Almost before you have had a chance to register the violence of the first sex with Hughes ('Washed my battered face, smeared with a purple bruise from Ted') and to note how far she goes to embrace it ('Consider yourself lucky to have been stabbed by him'), you can watch it racing into poetry: his 'I lust for him and in my mind am ripped to bits by the words he welds and wields', and her own - 'Where are my small incidents... the blood poured from my shoes.' Among other things, the journals offer us perhaps one of the most extraordinary records of sexual energy on the move: energy spilling and transmuting itself - but by no means always willing or able to do so - into words. In her therapy with Ruth Beutscher in 1959, Plath rages without let or inhibition against her mother (Beutscher had also treated her at McLean's hospital during her previous breakdown in 1953 and supervised her electric-shock treatments).

The teenage sensation has matured and is perhaps Real's one truly world class player who is up there with their legends of the past. Fernando Morientes: His race for fitness has filled many a newspaper column over the past few days. If he doesn't make it, there could be a recall for a certain solitary Frenchman.",

If Cherno Samba is half as good as people say he is, Millwall deserve much more money than that. But first things first. Samba is still on Millwall's books, though he will probably move in the near future. Millwall, who blame Samba's agent Harry Gerber for agitating for a transfer, are resigned to losing a player they discovered at the age of nine. </p> <p>Though Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester United are talking to Samba, they have not broken any rules. And perhaps most importantly, should a deal go through the fee will be set by an FA tribunal and paid to the London club as compensation. </p> <p>So while the average fan might be surprised to discover a multimillion pound market in schoolboys exists in these days of academies and catchment areas restricted to 90 minutes of travelling time, the real scandal would have been if a Premiership club had prised Samba away from his roots for a mere couple of hundred grand. </p> <p>That is what used to happen, when big clubs could pick up promising youngsters from all over the country for comparative peanuts and tolerate a high wastage rate which often left rejected players at a footballing and educational dead end. The academy system was put in place to end such exploitation, and though a superficial reading of the Samba headlines might suggest little has changed, in fact the opposite is true. </p> <p>The only way a club like Liverpool can now sign a player like Samba is to move his place of residence from the south to the north, taking full responsibility for his education and welfare as well as his football development, and agreeing to a compensatory fee which they know will be set high. Clubs like Liverpool can obviously offer larger contracts and better prospects than clubs like Millwall, but we are not quite at the stage yet where Premiership sides are making untried 15-year-olds into millionaires. </p> <p>The money goes to the selling club, not to the player, and because they are speculating so much on a proposition with a high degree of risk, the big clubs have to be sure of their judgment every time they go shopping outside their catchment area. So much for the good news. The bad news is there are several aspects of the Samba business which carry more than a whiff of the meat market. The first is that the same thing could happen to players as young as 12, and the second is agents acting on behalf of 15-year-olds. Millwall's suggestion that the PFA should outlaw this practice and act for minors themselves is slightly unrealistic, given that the union's detailed knowledge of every professional contract means they rarely negotiate with the agent's ruthless opportunism, but perhaps the best indication of Gerber's handling of his client's interests is that we have been reading all about it in the papers. </p> <p>'We didn't go to the press, and we are damn sure it wasn't Liverpool or Leeds,' a Millwall source said. 'We didn't want the story to come out, and there's no way all the publicity of the last few days has helped Cherno. He's still at school, for goodness sake. How much pressure is this putting on him?'</p> <p>Another concern is that an outlay of up to \u00a32m is easily affordable by Premiership sides - even Second Division Millwall say they are not hard up for such a sum - and that by allowing big academies to raid small ones the clubs who rely on sourcing and nurturing young talent are being penalised. It is not just the fact that Millwall could lose a player they have had for six years without seeing him pull on a senior shirt or score a league goal, frustrating though that must be, but the consideration that in normal circumstances, if Samba was to stay with the Lions and prove as hot a property as predicted, his eventual transfer fee could be \u00a310m or more. Millwall will be making that case to Samba in the near future, arguing he would break into the first team earlier at his present club, benefit from staying close to his family and still end up in the Premiership at an early age, but they fear the cause is lost. If the player goes, chairman Theo Paphitis is ready to say some harsh things about the billions swilling around in the Premiership and the lack of incentive for academies outside it. </p> <p>Yet perhaps there are too many academies in any case. There are 38 at the moment, with more in the pipeline, but Newcastle United's academy director Alan Irvine believes the number will fall before long. 'You are looking at an expensive investment with very long term results,' he explained. 'No one is saying academies are a bad idea, the best players in the country now play each other on a regular basis and that is a vast improvement on what went before. But although the whole purpose of the system is to produce more quality players, I'm not sure enough will come through to satisfy everyone. Clubs will start getting impatient soon, wondering where the return is for all their investment, and I don't suppose smaller academies losing their best players at an early stage is going to help matters.'</p> <p>The most pressing problem is not too many academies overall, however, but too many in close proximity. Ajax never had that problem, when they were pioneering the system and attracting virtually every promising kid in Holland by virtue of having the field to themselves. In England there are unhealthy concentrations of academies in London, the Midlands and the North West, where up to a dozen clubs can all share the same 90-minute catchment area, and movement of players between rivals causes the most bitter disputes. </p> <p>One smaller London club has just lost a player to a Premiership rival, and the boy's parents (agents cannot be blamed for everything) have been unwise enough to broadcast the details of his vastly improved contract. The player is now deeply unpopular at both his old academy and his new one, and under a huge amount of pressure to perform.</p> <p>Irvine believes even the North-East is overcrowded with academies. 'Only ourselves, Sunderland and Middlesbrough have them, but when you consider how much of our 90-minutes area is taken up by the North Sea and the bits of Yorkshire and Northumbria where nobody lives, you can understand why the populous areas are hotly contested. It is true there are more clubs in the Midlands, but there is also a much greater population on which to draw.' Small wonder Middlesbrough's youth team presently contains players from as far afield as Australia and Argentina, though Newcastle support the spirit of the 90-minute rule.</p> <p>'We could bring anyone from anywhere, even from abroad if we arrange their education, but I believe the ethos of academies is about developing kids in your own area,' Irvine said. 'We have a gentleman's agreement with the other local clubs not to poach each other's players, which works well, but very little is watertight in modern football. We could lose a promising kid to someone else without being able to do much about it. </p> <p>'Footballers have rights now, as well as agents. At practically every level of the game it has become much more difficult to hang on to your best players.'</p>",

Walsh is an unlikely record holder. For example, cast your eye down the list of 49 names nominated as possible Cricketers of the Century for this year's Wisden and CA Walsh is nowhere to be seen. For a decade from 1984, when he made his Test debut, Walsh was the support bowler of the West Indian quartet. He came on only after Michael Holding or Malcolm Marshall had had a go. It wasn't until Ambrose was the last remaining pace giant that Walsh was entrusted with the new ball and he started galloping up those bowling records. </p> <p>Walsh, the workaholic, became a strike bowler as well. His gangling, slightly uncoordinated action suggests - deceptively - that the ball is always coming into the right-handed batsman, leading to scores of victims in the slip cordon. That distinctive open-chested action makes the ball hard to pick up - at least Holding had the decency to possess the perfect, classical method of delivery, which enabled an early sight of the ball. Walsh changes his pace devilishly without any discernible change of action and has hit countless batsmen over the years - far more than Holding or Ambrose.

This was highlighted by his reaction to his sacking as West Indian captain two years ago when he was replaced by Brian Lara. With the exception of Gary Sobers, no West Indian captain, once removed from the job, had continued to play in the team. Walsh instinctively agreed to keep going and gave Lara his public backing (much-needed since Lara's first game in charge was to be in Jamaica). His small ego and big heart dictated that he could do nothing else, a reaction that surprised no one in Kingston or his adopted home of Bristol. Now we wonder whether Lara is capable of doing the same for the new West Indian captain, Jimmy Adams. </p> <p>Yet before we get too misty-eyed, also bear in mind that Courtney has been the most ruthless of operators on the field, however ready the smile has been once play has ended. In his time, Walsh has been prepared to explore the limits of fair play. In 1994 in Jamaica, it was Walsh who launched a madcap assault on England's hopeless No 11, Devon Malcolm, which could not be justified. Umpire Ian Robinson from Zimbabwe, in a shocking abnegation of his responsibilities, looked on without saying a dicky bird (the real Dickie Bird would have intervened) as he peppered Malcolm from around the wicket with a succession of vicious, needless bouncers. Walsh showed no remorse for that intimidatory spell. </p> <p>Just as memorable, though more acceptable, was his assault upon Michael Atherton in the same game. A keen adherent of the West Indian philosophy, 'Cut off the head and the rest will follow', Walsh targeted Atherton with more bouncers from around the wicket and refused to rest until England's captain was removed (he got him in the end). In this instance the cricket was awesome; with Malcolm on strike it was just plain awful. </p> <p>We can assume from the safety of the press box that the 2000 version of Walsh would not be capable of such ferocity, but I doubt whether you will find any English batsman who is prepared to express that view in public.

Which some would say is good enough reason for his name not being among those illustrious players shortlisted for Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Century, to be announced on Wednesday. </p> <p>But Doug Walters will always be a candidate for any list compiled by admirers of adventure, style and old-fashioned fallibility over more easily quantifiable genius. As will Keith Miller, whose name is just as mysteriously missing from the final board. </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that any of the 97 judges from around the world omitted either Don Bradman or Garfield Sobers from their selections and, as neither was shortlisted, they could not have picked Walters or Miller. Well, ever the illogical rebel, I'm overlooking Don, who was in a class all his own anyway, and picking the two lesser players, born gamblers who did not recognise the restrictions that shackled the skill of others when a few bob was at stake. </p> <p>When you start sounding like Lord Hawke hankering after the joys of unfettered amateurism, it's time to take stock. But Walters and Miller were the sort of players who are what cricket should be about in any era, at any level. Their gift was in giving vent to their spirit, even if the price was their wicket or an expensive over. </p> <p>Wisden asked the judges to 'set aside any bias to your own country and your own era, and name the five whose excellence... during the 20th century has made the greatest contribution to the game'. </p> <p>Sorry, again. Can't do it. I grew up 20 miles from Doug's home town of Dungog and have listened to so many stories of the Walters legend it is impossible to remain so admirably impartial and cool-headed about this; I'd take bets that few of the sage 97 entirely managed it, either. </p> <p>Those who saw Walters swing a bat will not easily forget his straight-backed, bum-out stance that exploded into action as dancing feet took him from the safety of his crease as he chased the ball with maddening randomness. When Abdul Qadir was bamboozling everyone in the Eighties with his leg-breaks and quirky, whip-like action, Walters answered one reporter's query about how to unravel his mystery: 'Just bloody go after him, mate, and see what happens.' </p> <p>Batting does not come simpler than that. However, such an uncomplicated approach to the torture of surviving against the best is bought at a price, and Walters was consistently found out on seaming English pitches in the Seventies. He averaged only 35 against England, 48 overall, so the argument is easily won that his technique was not tight enough when the moving ball asked the serious questions. </p> <p>But, so what? Looking at a few of the other names on that Wisden list - Learie Constantine (average, 19.24), Victor Trumper (39.05), Frank Woolley (36.08) - it is clear numbers are not everything. OK, you can't select every blazing cavalier in the game, but it always struck me that Walters suffered from the perception that he didn't care enough. On the contrary, he cared just enough, another mark of true excellence. </p> <p>In conversation with Geoff Boycott a couple of years ago, it was apparent that the only joy he got from the game was in the compiling of the runs rather than the luxury of flamboyance, which his talent, so obviously, was capable of delivering if he so wished. Purists will say that Boycott's pursuit of perfection is what carried him to what he, at least, regarded as greatness; it is also what made him probably the most selfish player since the Duke of Cumberland, and someone who still cannot see the funny side of being intentionally run out by a young Ian Botham during a Test in New Zealand. </p> <p>Geoffrey defended his wicket like a dog with a bone - and he still didn't make the Wisden shortlist of 49. Justice of a sort for romantics. </p> <p>But it is unfair to say that Walters did not care enough. His commitment was borne of his background, his technique moulded by his circumstances, on wickets that rewarded shotmakers with bucketfuls of boundaries on rock-hard and bumpy grounds around Dungog. Indeed the ground on which he first played was one of those stuck on top of a hill, the pitch a flat slab of concrete whose edges rose above the surrounding rough at least a couple of inches at each end. Playing fluently off the back foot, Doug and a hundred like him were impossible to bowl to when their eye was in. </p> <p>That's what he took to the higher level. Nothing was more normal to him than to thrash at a delivery that looked vaguely inviting. More difficult balls were a nuisance and even some of them were similarly hoiked to the country. Tales of Doug leaving his cigarette burning in the dressing-room before going out to bat and saying to team-mates, 'Don't put it out, I'll be back shortly,' are sort of true; Doug liked a drink, loved a smoke (which was handy, seeing his night-time job was shaking hands for Rothmans at corporate booze-ups), but he loved batting more. </p> <p>And everyone loved Doug. (Still do, I'd imagine.) The old slope of grass that was The Hill at the Sydney Cricket Ground, since shamefully built on by barbarians with no souls, doubled as the unofficial Doug Walters Stand and it was there that the legend was given substance on sunburnt, beery days as the country boy strolled bow-legged to the crease like a gunslinger looking for trouble. </p> <p>Perverse as ever, Doug reserved his most memorable shootout for a ground 3,000 miles from his SCG fans. On the second day of the second Test against England in Perth in 1974, he went mad between tea and the close, bringing play to a conclusion with a six off the last ball to reach his hundred. With the exception of Miller, Botham, Sobers and Viv Richards (my other choices, even though Walters and Miller are not among the 49), who, with grand and reckless disregard for their average and their reputation, would even think of doing that? When David Gower tried it he was lambasted. </p> <p>Doug's courage came from his thirst for gambling, as did Miller's. But, like all gamblers, he didn't always win. Fielding in the slip against a provincial team on a small, near-empty ground in New Zealand once, Ian Chappell chided Walters for missing a straightforward catch in the slips. 'What are you playing at?' Chappell demanded. 'Sorry, Chappelli,' Doug said. 'I was just counting the crowd. Got a bet on it.' </p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What occurred at Hampden Park last Wednesday night was about as unexpected as the tide. France's nonchalant 2-0 victory over Scotland did not reveal, but merely confirmed, that the world champions operate at a level several storeys higher than the Scots. </p> <p>But its very predictability emphasised the wisdom of arranging a fixture against opposition of such quality, the first of three searching examinations in advance of Scotland's opening World Cup 2002 qualifier, against Latvia in Riga in September. </p> <p>In the circumstances - a comfortable 90 minutes for Roger Lemerre's formidable squad - the widely anticipated problems Craig Brown may have been pondering could not have been aggravated by what transpired on the field. The widespread acceptance of the inevitability of a home defeat led to a conspicuous lack of the media-driven ridicule that normally accompanies a loss in which the Scots have been made to look third rate. </p> <p>In addition, the mixture of international novices and newcomers that peppered Brown's squad would be much more stimulated - if not inspired - by the presence of the World Cup holders than they would by a visit from, say, Mediterranean islanders, one of the newer European republics, a principality or a Grand Duchy. </p> <p>The exercise proved to be of more value to the Scots' coach than to his counterpart, who brought his celebrated players to Glasgow primarily to fulfil a diary engagement, lending grace to the official reopening of the national stadium; <em>toujours la politesse</em>. </p> <p>Colin Hendry's admiration for the French ('Sometimes you just have to own up and say the opposition are too good for you') was echoed unanimously by those who changed afterwards in the home dressing-room, supporting Brown's claim that an outing against an exceptionally talented group would have no detrimental effect on Scottish morale. </p> <p>'Morale has never been a problem with us,' he said. 'Our players know they are capable of certain things at a certain level and they're not going to get down in the dumps about being beaten by a team who really are worthy world champions. We do, however, have problems in other areas, especially in attack. </p> <p>'There is a lack of physical presence in the front line. Billy Dodds and Kevin Gallacher work well together, but there has to be more strength there. You don't have to be big, as Brazil showed when they won the '94 World Cup with two small strikers, Romario and Bebeto, But you do need other qualities and Dodds and Gallacher don't have what Romario and Bebeto had.' </p> <p>Brown is convinced that Don Hutchison will be much more profitable to the Scotland team when he is moved into a three-man front line containing another striker and Neil McCann wide on the left. But his shortage of resources ensures that moving Hutchison forward could be a complex business, involving a series of alterations elsewhere. </p> <p>The difficulty is most pronounced at wing-back on the right side, where Craig Burley has been the best the Scots have had in recent years. Despite the Derby County man's distaste for the role, Brown himself would prefer to see Burley moved into a central midfield area that would, ideally, also contain Barry Ferguson and Paul Lambert. 'But we have to get somebody who can fill Burley's shoes on the right. We didn't get the chance to see Jackie McNamara against the French and, although Paul Telfer did all right in the first half, it was asking a lot on his debut against that opposition and at a time when he hadn't played much because of injury. </p> <p>'Christian Dailly can play wing-back, because he can defend and has pace, but that would mean removing him from central defence and I really want to keep him there. We haven't been as solid in that area as we were when Hendry, Tom Boyd and Colin Calderwood were at their best. I think we can get it back with Dailly in Calderwood's place and I do want to see Matt Elliott in the coming matches against either Holland, or Ireland, or both. </p> <p>'However you look at it, we could be forced to make several changes in order to effect just one. At this time of the year and in friendly matches, call-offs are inevitable, but I'd like to think we'll have everybody available for Latvia in September. I am keen to go towards the three-man attack with which we beat England at Wembley, because we will have to get more penetration in the World Cup qualifiers.' </p> <p>Whatever problems Brown has look like privileges when set beside the difficulties faced by Kenny Dalglish, who would have been numbed with shock at the discovery of how poor his Celtic team can be in the 4-0 whipping by Rangers at Ibrox last Sunday. </p> <p>If Rangers are only two or three players away from being good enough at least to reach the second group phase of the Champions League, Celtic appear to be a minimum of seven short of a team even competent to make a telling challenge on their city rivals' domestic supremacy. Thursday's announcement by the Ibrox chairman, David Murray, of a rights issue that could bring \u00a353 million into the club simply deepens Dalglish's difficulties. </p> <p>Much of the money raised by Rangers will have to be used to reduce debt that currently stands at \u00a348 million, but Dick Advocaat will still be allowed a substantial amount for strengthening in the close season. Celtic's borrowing power could certainly enable them to spend at least as much as their great rivals but they are so far showing a marked reluctance to travel that route. </p> <p>In any case, even if they did, they would be starting from a position so far back on the grid that mere parity in the business of recruitment would still leave the leaders almost out of sight. </p>",

In addition, the mixture of international novices and newcomers that peppered Brown's squad would be much more stimulated - if not inspired - by the presence of the World Cup holders than they would by a visit from, say, Mediterranean islanders, one of the newer European republics, a principality or a Grand Duchy. The exercise proved to be of more value to the Scots' coach than to his counterpart, who brought his celebrated players to Glasgow primarily to fulfil a diary engagement, lending grace to the official reopening of the national stadium; toujours la politesse. Colin Hendry's admiration for the French ('Sometimes you just have to own up and say the opposition are too good for you') was echoed unanimously by those who changed afterwards in the home dressing-room, supporting Brown's claim that an outing against an exceptionally talented group would have no detrimental effect on Scottish morale. 'Morale has never been a problem with us,' he said. 'Our players know they are capable of certain things at a certain level and they're not going to get down in the dumps about being beaten by a team who really are worthy world champions. We do, however, have problems in other areas, especially in attack. 'There is a lack of physical presence in the front line. Billy Dodds and Kevin Gallacher work well together, but there has to be more strength there. You don't have to be big, as Brazil showed when they won the '94 World Cup with two small strikers, Romario and Bebeto, But you do need other qualities and Dodds and Gallacher don't have what Romario and Bebeto had.' Brown is convinced that Don Hutchison will be much more profitable to the Scotland team when he is moved into a three-man front line containing another striker and Neil McCann wide on the left. But his shortage of resources ensures that moving Hutchison forward could be a complex business, involving a series of alterations elsewhere. The difficulty is most pronounced at wing-back on the right side, where Craig Burley has been the best the Scots have had in recent years. Despite the Derby County man's distaste for the role, Brown himself would prefer to see Burley moved into a central midfield area that would, ideally, also contain Barry Ferguson and Paul Lambert. 'But we have to get somebody who can fill Burley's shoes on the right. We didn't get the chance to see Jackie McNamara against the French and, although Paul Telfer did all right in the first half, it was asking a lot on his debut against that opposition and at a time when he hadn't played much because of injury. 'Christian Dailly can play wing-back, because he can defend and has pace, but that would mean removing him from central defence and I really want to keep him there. We haven't been as solid in that area as we were when Hendry, Tom Boyd and Colin Calderwood were at their best. I think we can get it back with Dailly in Calderwood's place and I do want to see Matt Elliott in the coming matches against either Holland, or Ireland, or both. 'However you look at it, we could be forced to make several changes in order to effect just one. At this time of the year and in friendly matches, call-offs are inevitable, but I'd like to think we'll have everybody available for Latvia in September. I am keen to go towards the three-man attack with which we beat England at Wembley, because we will have to get more penetration in the World Cup qualifiers.' Whatever problems Brown has look like privileges when set beside the difficulties faced by Kenny Dalglish, who would have been numbed with shock at the discovery of how poor his Celtic team can be in the 4-0 whipping by Rangers at Ibrox last Sunday. If Rangers are only two or three players away from being good enough at least to reach the second group phase of the Champions League, Celtic appear to be a minimum of seven short of a team even competent to make a telling challenge on their city rivals' domestic supremacy. Thursday's announcement by the Ibrox chairman, David Murray, of a rights issue that could bring \u00a353 million into the club simply deepens Dalglish's difficulties. Much of the money raised by Rangers will have to be used to reduce debt that currently stands at \u00a348 million, but Dick Advocaat will still be allowed a substantial amount for strengthening in the close season. Celtic's borrowing power could certainly enable them to spend at least as much as their great rivals but they are so far showing a marked reluctance to travel that route. In any case, even if they did, they would be starting from a position so far back on the grid that mere parity in the business of recruitment would still leave the leaders almost out of sight.",

However, a team of top-class foreigners playing under the same name, in a stadium built on the site of the old Stamford Bridge, meet Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Wednesday. The new Chelsea have nothing in common with anything that existed in 1995. But their opponents, Barcelona, do. </p> <p>For it was on May 24, 1995 that an Ajax team consisting largely of underpaid schoolboys played the final of the Champions League in Vienna. </p> <p>Hanging around before kick-off against AC Milan, an impatient Ronald de Boer wondered: 'What if I ask the referee if we can start 15 minutes early, like a boys' game?' In the tunnel, the 19-year-old Clarence Seedorf and his pal Edgar Davids did tricks with a football. </p> <p>The match was tight. The Ajax coach, Louis van Gaal, grew so agitated that at one point he executed a flying karate kick in imitation of a foul by Milan's Marcel Desailly. Young Michael Reiziger, the Ajax right-back, was often overrun. Whenever he did something right his older team-mate, Frank Rijkaard, acting as a sort of scout leader, would shout: 'Class, Mike!' </p> <p>Midway through the second half with the score 0-0, Van Gaal sent on two 18-year-olds: Patrick Kluivert, who lived at home with his mother, and the Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu, who drove around Amsterdam in a beat-up Opel. They replaced Seedorf and Jari Litmanen. </p> <p>In the 85th minute Rijkaard passed to Kluivert, who scored. Ajax had won the Champions League with a team that cost less than \u00a31 million to assemble. </p> <p>On board the Barcelona plane on Tuesday will be six of the boys of Vienna: Kluivert, Ronald and Frank de Boer, Reiziger, Litmanen and Winston Bogarde, who sat on the bench in 1995. The Barcelona manager, that same Louis van Gaal, is engaged in an exercise in trying to repeat history. </p> <p>There are, admittedly, one or two differences between Ajax then and Barca now. In 1995, Litmanen and the De Boer twins were kingpins of Ajax. Now, the injury-prone Litmanen is going the way of the Pope, making few appearances and looking more frail each time, while Ronald de Boer has a bad knee. He still understands football, never loses the ball, but covers much less ground. His brother, Frank, has matured from left-back into sweeper but he too lacks pace. </p> <p>Kluivert, on the other hand, has become a complete centre-forward. He scores, but goals are not his primary interest. Rather, he operates as a playmaker from the front, spreading the ball to his wingers with backheels and volleys, football's most delicate big man. </p> <p>The wings are the main difference between Ajax 95 and Barca 00. Ajax's pair worked hard and never held the ball for more than a second. One of those selfless team men was Finidi George and the other, believe it or not, Marc Overmars. </p> <p>On leaving Ajax, Overmars underwent a personality transformation in a Los Angeles clinic and has never since passed the ball. </p> <p>Barcelona's wingers are Rivaldo and Luis Figo. Rivaldo is arguably the world's best player, but no one has ever called him a selfless team man. He tends to dribble with the ball until he either loses it or scores. Figo, on the right wing, is more of a pragmatist but still likes to beat a man or two before crossing. 'Rivaldo and Figo are very extreme footballers,' grunts Ronald de Boer. </p> <p>Last autumn I asked De Boer to compare Ajax of 95 with today's Barca. 'The individuals at Barca have more quality,' he said, 'but as a team we don't yet. The way we stuck together at Ajax - we are a long way off that.' </p> <p>Since then, however, Barca have progressed. Rivaldo still never passes, but the others find each other so easily they sometimes seem to be playing computer football. Ruud Hesp, Barcelona's Dutch keeper, is almost as good a passer as Edwin van der Sar, the Ajax keeper of 95. </p> <p>The similarities between the teams have been noted before. The Barcelona newspapers scathingly call the new team 'Barcajax'. For a long time they complained that Van Gaal was ethnically cleansing all Catalans from the side and replacing them with Dutchmen. Why, they asked, was Albert Ferrer sold to Chelsea only to be replaced by the ostensibly no more gifted Reiziger? </p> <p>Gradually, however, the Catalans are ceasing to grumble. They have seen their side improve. Furthermore, this winter they saw Van Gaal drop the De Boers, Litmanen and Reiziger. The De Boers told a bemused Catalan press that they deserved to be dropped because they were playing badly. They have since come back, but Reiziger is still on the bench, watching the young Catalan Carlos Puyol in his place. Two other young locals, Xavi and Gabri, regularly play, and Josep Guardiola, Catalonia's favourite son, is restored as captain. </p> <p>Van Gaal has created the same side twice, and the Barcelona version may be better than the Ajax original. On 24 May, 2000, five years to the day of their first Champions League final, his boys expect to be playing their second.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Something very strange is happening at the Football Association. For the first time in living memory, they are making some sensible decisions. Last week they made two - punishing Leicester over their ticket distribution, and moving to stop racial abuse of Emile Heskey. </p> <p>Getting hold of a Wembley cup final ticket, as every football fan knows, can be a real ordeal. Even season-ticket holders are not guaranteed a ticket, but through fans' pressure over the years the proportion of tickets going to the finalists has increased. </p> <p>I was lucky enough to get one to see Spurs play Leicester in the Worthington Cup final in 1999. For Leicester fans, the last-minute defeat must have been very hard to take. They will have felt even worse on learning that some Leicester players and officials had grabbed hundreds of tickets for themselves, and many of them ended up in the hands of Spurs supporters. One of those fans, Ruth Lelacheur, suffered just about the worst day of her life when she and her family were attacked by Spurs nutters in the Leicester end who had got their tickets from those greedy Leicester officials and players. As if these people don't earn enough money already. </p> <p>The decision to fine the culprits a total of \u00a375,000 is welcome and I even hear the FA are looking to ensure that such fines go to good causes, a truly revolutionary concept. One such good cause would be Ruth Lelacheur, who is still haunted by her ordeal. She summed up the feelings of all football supporters when she said: 'What happened has soured my opinion of the game. When players do things like this they completely betray the fans.' </p> <p>Not that you'd have thought so from Leicester's reaction to their punishment? A spokesman for the players did not apologise, but said: 'The penalties imposed are draconian.' And a spokesman for the club said: 'The FA seem to have got it in for Leicester.' Too damn right they have, and if anything Leicester got off lightly. </p> <p>Originally the club refused to provide a breakdown of the allocation to players, not surprising given that they had so many. Tony Cottee had 79 tickets: didn't the club think that this was a bit many? And what about the Leicester academy director David Nish? He was allocated a staggering 129 tickets. It's surprising that there were any left for the fans at all. </p> <p>The fact that Heskey was not one of the greedy Leicester players came as no surprise, because he seems to be a thoroughly decent chap. This made the racist taunts aimed at him during the England under-21 game against Yugoslavia in Barcelona even harder to stomach. </p> <p>For once the England fans' behaviour was not an issue and for once the FA acted decisively. David Davies, the FA's executive director, personally intervened to demand that the Spanish security men put a stop to the abuse, which they did. But even on TV you could tell that Heskey was also being subjected to severe provocation by the Yugoslav players. It's a pity the German referee was not more decisive, though it's a shame that the Sky commentators could not resist anti-German gibes whilst pretending the racist abuse of Heskey was not happening. </p> <p>It seems that under the leadership of their new chief executive, Adam Crozier, the FA are acting far more decisively. There are more big tests ahead, and the most important one is doing everything they can to discourage bad behaviour among the England fans at Euro 2000.

      "bodyText": "Something very strange is happening at the Football Association. For the first time in living memory, they are making some sensible decisions. Last week they made two - punishing Leicester over their ticket distribution, and moving to stop racial abuse of Emile Heskey. Getting hold of a Wembley cup final ticket, as every football fan knows, can be a real ordeal. Even season-ticket holders are not guaranteed a ticket, but through fans' pressure over the years the proportion of tickets going to the finalists has increased. I was lucky enough to get one to see Spurs play Leicester in the Worthington Cup final in 1999. For Leicester fans, the last-minute defeat must have been very hard to take. They will have felt even worse on learning that some Leicester players and officials had grabbed hundreds of tickets for themselves, and many of them ended up in the hands of Spurs supporters. One of those fans, Ruth Lelacheur, suffered just about the worst day of her life when she and her family were attacked by Spurs nutters in the Leicester end who had got their tickets from those greedy Leicester officials and players. As if these people don't earn enough money already. The decision to fine the culprits a total of \u00a375,000 is welcome and I even hear the FA are looking to ensure that such fines go to good causes, a truly revolutionary concept. One such good cause would be Ruth Lelacheur, who is still haunted by her ordeal. She summed up the feelings of all football supporters when she said: 'What happened has soured my opinion of the game. When players do things like this they completely betray the fans.' Not that you'd have thought so from Leicester's reaction to their punishment? A spokesman for the players did not apologise, but said: 'The penalties imposed are draconian.' And a spokesman for the club said: 'The FA seem to have got it in for Leicester.' Too damn right they have, and if anything Leicester got off lightly. Originally the club refused to provide a breakdown of the allocation to players, not surprising given that they had so many. Tony Cottee had 79 tickets: didn't the club think that this was a bit many? And what about the Leicester academy director David Nish? He was allocated a staggering 129 tickets. It's surprising that there were any left for the fans at all. The fact that Heskey was not one of the greedy Leicester players came as no surprise, because he seems to be a thoroughly decent chap. This made the racist taunts aimed at him during the England under-21 game against Yugoslavia in Barcelona even harder to stomach. For once the England fans' behaviour was not an issue and for once the FA acted decisively. David Davies, the FA's executive director, personally intervened to demand that the Spanish security men put a stop to the abuse, which they did. But even on TV you could tell that Heskey was also being subjected to severe provocation by the Yugoslav players. It's a pity the German referee was not more decisive, though it's a shame that the Sky commentators could not resist anti-German gibes whilst pretending the racist abuse of Heskey was not happening. It seems that under the leadership of their new chief executive, Adam Crozier, the FA are acting far more decisively. There are more big tests ahead, and the most important one is doing everything they can to discourage bad behaviour among the England fans at Euro 2000. If the FA don't organise better than they did for the World Cup in France, then they can forget about hosting the World Cup in 2006.",

      "body": "<p>Just one goal but seven points and a lot of dreams separate Birmingham from Wolves. Yesterday, in a match as intense as any local derby, Birmingham won by a single goal - but it was not a good day for Wolves. </p> <p>It has not been a good week for Wolves' captain Keith Curle. He started it by spending several hours in police custody answering questions about an assault in Wolverhampton city centre, before being released pending further enquiries. </p> <p>Yesterday, after 25 minutes, he missed a penalty. It was a dreadful shot and Thomas Myhre, playing his debut game for Birmingham, lunged left and scooped the effort safely into his hands - a save, with the score at 0-0, that was to prove crucial. </p> <p>The penalty came after Darren Purse snatched at a lame-looking cross from Danish international Alan Nielsen with his hands. Purse picked up a yellow card, Curle stepped up to miss. </p> <p>The lost opportunity added to Colin Lee's anger on the grass verge patio of his dug-out bungalow. The fourth official had to intervene several times during the first half to keep Lee from invading the Birmingham dug-out area. The police also got involved to keep order. </p> <p>When Wolves beat Birmingham 106 days ago it was a cold and unforgiving night just before Christmas, a very different affair lacking passion, when Birmingham fans actually returned 1,200 of their allocated 3,000 tickets. </p> <p>That game ended with Wolves defender Kevin Muscat, an Australian with a typically quirky sense of humour, being escorted off the pitch at the final whistle after a gesture incited the frozen and bored Birmingham faithful. Muscat received a suitable welcome yesterday. </p> <p>Curle's penalty was not the only missed chance of the opening half. For Birmingham, David Holdsworth had a scrambled kick, delivered from a sprawled position in front of goal, cleared off the line by Muscat. No doubt the Australian was grinning. </p> <p>But it was Holdsworth, in the 54th minute, who rose unmolested to head past Michael Oakes, giving his team a lead that had looked inevitable from the re-start. </p> <p>The introduction by Lee of George Ndah for Andy Sinton had not worked. Sinton is simply too busy to be replaced by a striker who has not played in the First Division because of injury since last October.

      "bodyText": "Just one goal but seven points and a lot of dreams separate Birmingham from Wolves. Yesterday, in a match as intense as any local derby, Birmingham won by a single goal - but it was not a good day for Wolves. It has not been a good week for Wolves' captain Keith Curle. He started it by spending several hours in police custody answering questions about an assault in Wolverhampton city centre, before being released pending further enquiries. Yesterday, after 25 minutes, he missed a penalty. It was a dreadful shot and Thomas Myhre, playing his debut game for Birmingham, lunged left and scooped the effort safely into his hands - a save, with the score at 0-0, that was to prove crucial. The penalty came after Darren Purse snatched at a lame-looking cross from Danish international Alan Nielsen with his hands. Purse picked up a yellow card, Curle stepped up to miss. The lost opportunity added to Colin Lee's anger on the grass verge patio of his dug-out bungalow. The fourth official had to intervene several times during the first half to keep Lee from invading the Birmingham dug-out area. The police also got involved to keep order. When Wolves beat Birmingham 106 days ago it was a cold and unforgiving night just before Christmas, a very different affair lacking passion, when Birmingham fans actually returned 1,200 of their allocated 3,000 tickets. That game ended with Wolves defender Kevin Muscat, an Australian with a typically quirky sense of humour, being escorted off the pitch at the final whistle after a gesture incited the frozen and bored Birmingham faithful. Muscat received a suitable welcome yesterday. Curle's penalty was not the only missed chance of the opening half. For Birmingham, David Holdsworth had a scrambled kick, delivered from a sprawled position in front of goal, cleared off the line by Muscat. No doubt the Australian was grinning. But it was Holdsworth, in the 54th minute, who rose unmolested to head past Michael Oakes, giving his team a lead that had looked inevitable from the re-start. The introduction by Lee of George Ndah for Andy Sinton had not worked. Sinton is simply too busy to be replaced by a striker who has not played in the First Division because of injury since last October. It was a major factor in Birmingham's dominance of the second half. In the Birmingham goal Myhre continued to justify the bureaucratic problems surrounding his post-deadline loan from Everton. 'It was an emergency,' claimed Birmingham manager Trevor Francis, prompted by injuries to both of his first-team keepers. In the 80th minute, Muscat was once again at the centre of the action when he watched in amazement as Birmingham captain Martin O'Connor lashed out at him. O'Connor was shown a red card and left to a hero's reception in front of his home fans. With less than 30 seconds of official time left Bryan Hughes was sent off for diving, joining his captain in the warm but noisy walk back to an early bath.",

      "byline": "Ian Ridley at Highfield Road",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Coventry manager Gordon Strachan has described Highfield Road as Jurassic Park - a reference to his clutch of veterans. If so, then Michael Owen contributed to their extinction there yesterday with a two-goal display of swift, incisive finishing as his season gains momentum at the right time for England and Euro 2000. </p> <p>A potential partner for him there, Emile Heskey, also headed his first goal on his fifth start for his new club after his \u00a311 million move from Leicester as Liverpool sent Coventry to their sixth defeat in eight games and extended their own unbeaten record to 10 games. The scent of a Champions League place seems ever stronger in their nostrils. </p> <p>After a sloppy opening in which they frequently gave the ball away, Liverpool gradually seized control in the game's engine room of central midfield where Dietmar Hamann and Steven Gerrard once more looked strong enough to make light of the continued absence of Jamie Redknapp. </p> <p>Owen, displeased at being omitted against Newcastle last week as Gerard Houllier gently reintroduces him after his injury rehabiliation, served notice of what was to come when he forced Steve Ogrizovic into a fine low save after Gerrard had headed him clear. The veteran goalkeeper, at 42 making his 600th appearance for Coventry as deputy for the injured Magnus Hedman, could do nothing about Owen's next attempt, however. </p> <p>There looked little danger as Dominic Matteo played the ball in low from the left but Owen had spun away from his marker, Richard Shaw, to make a yard of space in which to receive the pass. Having eluded him, he then danced round Colin Hendry before burying a crisp, low shot for his 10th goal of the season. </p> <p>It was a splendid moment of quick feet and thinking, Coventry undone in an instant. Now Owen was hungry for more and there was a spring in his leap when Patrik Berger's cross came in from the right, his header only just over the bar. </p> <p>In an attempt to turn the tide, the Coventry manager, Gordon Strachan, withdrew a clearly annoyed Noel Whelan and replaced him with the \u00a36 million teenager Robbie Keane, still feeling his way back after a knee injury. Owen was not to be outdone as the game's young prodigy, however, and within minutes he had extended Liverpool's lead. </p> <p>They built neatly, the hitherto subdued Emile Heskey finding Gerrard who in turn set Matteo free on the left.

      "bodyText": "The Coventry manager Gordon Strachan has described Highfield Road as Jurassic Park - a reference to his clutch of veterans. If so, then Michael Owen contributed to their extinction there yesterday with a two-goal display of swift, incisive finishing as his season gains momentum at the right time for England and Euro 2000. A potential partner for him there, Emile Heskey, also headed his first goal on his fifth start for his new club after his \u00a311 million move from Leicester as Liverpool sent Coventry to their sixth defeat in eight games and extended their own unbeaten record to 10 games. The scent of a Champions League place seems ever stronger in their nostrils. After a sloppy opening in which they frequently gave the ball away, Liverpool gradually seized control in the game's engine room of central midfield where Dietmar Hamann and Steven Gerrard once more looked strong enough to make light of the continued absence of Jamie Redknapp. Owen, displeased at being omitted against Newcastle last week as Gerard Houllier gently reintroduces him after his injury rehabiliation, served notice of what was to come when he forced Steve Ogrizovic into a fine low save after Gerrard had headed him clear. The veteran goalkeeper, at 42 making his 600th appearance for Coventry as deputy for the injured Magnus Hedman, could do nothing about Owen's next attempt, however. There looked little danger as Dominic Matteo played the ball in low from the left but Owen had spun away from his marker, Richard Shaw, to make a yard of space in which to receive the pass. Having eluded him, he then danced round Colin Hendry before burying a crisp, low shot for his 10th goal of the season. It was a splendid moment of quick feet and thinking, Coventry undone in an instant. Now Owen was hungry for more and there was a spring in his leap when Patrik Berger's cross came in from the right, his header only just over the bar. In an attempt to turn the tide, the Coventry manager, Gordon Strachan, withdrew a clearly annoyed Noel Whelan and replaced him with the \u00a36 million teenager Robbie Keane, still feeling his way back after a knee injury. Owen was not to be outdone as the game's young prodigy, however, and within minutes he had extended Liverpool's lead. They built neatly, the hitherto subdued Emile Heskey finding Gerrard who in turn set Matteo free on the left. His low cross was allowed to reach Owen, Froggatt failing to cut it out, and this time he sidestepped John Eustace before tucking the ball past Ogrizovic. After that, it was virtually game over. A shot by Moustapha Hadji that flew just wide was the best that a downbeat Coventry could manage in the second half. You had the impression, meanwhile, that Liverpool could have added to their tally whenever they needed to. The lively Thompson was close with a low drive and forced Ogrizovic into another flying save with a shot from 25 yards. The goalkeeper also denied Heskey by twice keeping out powerful shots and thwarted Owen's hat-trick ambitions by saving with his legs after Heskey had slipped the ball through. Finally the scoreline was made just when Heskey rose unchallenged to head home Berger's curling free-kick from the right.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Football managers always need a vision. John Gregory's has little to do with future long-term strategy, more with a past memory and a short-term hope. Actually, it is a vision of Brian Clough. 'I remember Cloughie telling a story of how he came home from Wembley with a trophy, put it on top of the telly and sat down to watch the game on Match of the Day eating fish and chips out of the paper,' says Gregory. 'I'd love to do that.' </p> <p>It was a rare, vulnerable moment of idle dreaming in the build-up to today's FA Cup semi-final against Bolton Wanderers as he has sought to instil in his Aston Villa team that this is not yet the final, for all the trappings and triggers that playing the game at Wembley inspires. He would not, for example, entertain the sponsors' request to display the trophy on press day at Villa Park. Forty-three years and counting since the club last won the lovely old pot; too close now to tempt fate. </p> <p>In these days of the pasta, paella and Perrier Premiership, Gregory has assembled a fish-and-chips sort of team, still very English despite the introduction of Benito Carbone, to bring a draft of the warm south and ease the creative burden on Paul Merson. It is a team developing in the image one of the domestic game's youngest and most outspoken, even controversial, managers. </p> <p>'How does the team reflect me?' He ponders the question. 'There's no frills to them really. They roll their sleeves up and get on with it. They are just hard-working, honest types who don't mind getting a bit of a sweat on. They've got a lot of character and - which is nothing to do with me - they've got a lot of ability. They are mentally pretty tough. </p> <p>'They sort things out themselves. I like players to be able to deal with everyday events so that I don't have to pamper or mollycoddle them. It's pretty simple really. Beni and Paul are the flair in the side, there's no doubt about that, but you've always go to harness flair with hard work.' </p> <p>It was a surprise when Gregory was awarded such a high-profile job just over two years ago when better known names coveted it. His history with what he describes as 'my club' tells much, though. He was a decent right-back Villa in the late Seventies before moving on to Brighton and Queens Park Rangers, switching to midfield and winning six England caps as a capable, if unspectacular, passer of the ball. </p> <p>After a sorry spell in his first management job at Portsmouth, Brian Little took him on as coach at Leicester, then at Villa amid the acrimonious move. After a while, Gregory hankered for a number one's job again and moved to Wycombe Wanderers. When Little was sacked, the Villa chairman Doug Ellis knew who he wanted. </p> <p>An irony is that when Gregory departed as a player, he lamented that you had to be a yes man to survive at Villa. He could hardly be described as that these days. Early in the season he responded forcefully to a couple of critical Ellis comments about the ordinary football the team were playing, the chairman concerned about falling gates. </p> <p>When Villa were on a losing streak pre-Christmas, the demanding Ellis, not noted for his indulgence of managers, might have reacted badly. Instead, he said that all the letters he received - more than 100 - urging him to sack Gregory meant nothing. In fact, he had Gregory round to his house for tea and sympathy. 'People forget that it is easy to sack a manager but a lot more difficult to find a new one.' </p> <p>If that statement shows that Ellis has learned the odd thing down the years, then Gregory's handling of himself also illustrates a personal development in the job as he has dealt with the dramas and crises common at a big club, his respite being to lose himself in music. He is a Bruce Springsteen nut - it is rumoured that the club's pre-season tour in New York was organised around one of The Boss's gigs there - and has appeared on Ian Wright's television show in a band. </p> <p>After steering Villa clear of relegation in the early months of his tenure, Gregory then took them to the top of the Premiership in the first half of last season. His assertion that if Villa didn't win it from there, then it would only be down to him came over as arrogant, however, and rival managers were riled by the upstart newcomer. </p> <p>Then the problems mounted when Villa began this season badly. He received a touchline ban for criticising referees. He was involved in a dispute with Stan Collymore that resulted in his release to Leicester. Gregory's team selections, as he tried to blend about \u00a335 million worth of talent, resulted in a chant of 'You don't know what you're doing' from the Holte End at one point. </p> <p>He has, he admits, made mistakes and his failure to understand Collymore's illness of depression, which so hurt the player, was probably part of his own learning process. This past week he has been getting Merson and Carbone to sort out their differences, the Italian taking exception to Merson's comments that the club should not be held to ransom over wage demands. </p> <p>'Not standing on the side of the pitch has helped,' he says. 'Being up in the stand helps me make more right and better decisions.' Clearly he has not changed that much, though. He still cannot resist returning to the bench at times and using that invaluable coach's aid, the piercing whistle that he learned from his father. </p> <p>Nor should he need to change beyond the modifications of behaviour and the moderation in his public statements. His players say he is consistent in his treatment of them through the good and bad times and self-certain enough to be unworried by what people say about him. It was Gregory's positive nature, the goalkeeper David James says, that convinced him to sign last summer. </p> <p>'He's always available to everybody whether things are going badly or going well,' says captain Gareth Southgate. 'And when things were going badly, he didn't allow things to get through to the players. The only occasion when I saw the pressure getting to him was when he kicked the physio's bag halfway across Goodison Park.' </p> <p>Gregory is certainly a quirky manager. At Wycombe, he once fined a player for not wearing flip-flops in the showers, reasoning that a professional should protect his feet, the tools of his trade. At Villa, it is said he insists on white soap, not green, because it makes the place look better. </p> <p>'We were familiar with all his methods from his time as coach here,' says Southgate. 'He is very particular and meticulous. He likes the training ground to be tidy and wants it to run efficiently. I totally agree with him. </p> <p>'But he treats you as adults. If you want to make a phone call on the team bus you can. He just expects you to prepare in the right way and he wants players he can trust. If you betray that trust, he will come down hard on you.' </p> <p>Since Gregory took over, Villa have lost players who have gone on to bigger and better things; Savo Milosevic, Dwight Yorke and Mark Bosnich. The task for him is make this big club bigger. The FA Cup would be a help in attracting the best of the best to come to, and stay with, the club. It would also mean that the worthy Gregory will literally, though not metaphorically, have had his chips. </p>",

He is a Bruce Springsteen nut - it is rumoured that the club's pre-season tour in New York was organised around one of The Boss's gigs there - and has appeared on Ian Wright's television show in a band. After steering Villa clear of relegation in the early months of his tenure, Gregory then took them to the top of the Premiership in the first half of last season. His assertion that if Villa didn't win it from there, then it would only be down to him came over as arrogant, however, and rival managers were riled by the upstart newcomer. Then the problems mounted when Villa began this season badly. He received a touchline ban for criticising referees. He was involved in a dispute with Stan Collymore that resulted in his release to Leicester. Gregory's team selections, as he tried to blend about \u00a335 million worth of talent, resulted in a chant of 'You don't know what you're doing' from the Holte End at one point. He has, he admits, made mistakes and his failure to understand Collymore's illness of depression, which so hurt the player, was probably part of his own learning process. This past week he has been getting Merson and Carbone to sort out their differences, the Italian taking exception to Merson's comments that the club should not be held to ransom over wage demands. 'Not standing on the side of the pitch has helped,' he says. 'Being up in the stand helps me make more right and better decisions.' Clearly he has not changed that much, though. He still cannot resist returning to the bench at times and using that invaluable coach's aid, the piercing whistle that he learned from his father. Nor should he need to change beyond the modifications of behaviour and the moderation in his public statements. His players say he is consistent in his treatment of them through the good and bad times and self-certain enough to be unworried by what people say about him. It was Gregory's positive nature, the goalkeeper David James says, that convinced him to sign last summer. 'He's always available to everybody whether things are going badly or going well,' says captain Gareth Southgate. 'And when things were going badly, he didn't allow things to get through to the players. The only occasion when I saw the pressure getting to him was when he kicked the physio's bag halfway across Goodison Park.' Gregory is certainly a quirky manager. At Wycombe, he once fined a player for not wearing flip-flops in the showers, reasoning that a professional should protect his feet, the tools of his trade. At Villa, it is said he insists on white soap, not green, because it makes the place look better. 'We were familiar with all his methods from his time as coach here,' says Southgate. 'He is very particular and meticulous. He likes the training ground to be tidy and wants it to run efficiently. I totally agree with him. 'But he treats you as adults. If you want to make a phone call on the team bus you can. He just expects you to prepare in the right way and he wants players he can trust. If you betray that trust, he will come down hard on you.' Since Gregory took over, Villa have lost players who have gone on to bigger and better things; Savo Milosevic, Dwight Yorke and Mark Bosnich. The task for him is make this big club bigger. The FA Cup would be a help in attracting the best of the best to come to, and stay with, the club. It would also mean that the worthy Gregory will literally, though not metaphorically, have had his chips.",

Terry Venables was probably one of the few managers who was already looking into the dietary side of things, whereas most clubs did not do that until later. </p> <p>'You have to socialise when the time is right and there still is that element in English football. The team spirit is very important and it has always been very good wherever I've been. I would say I was pleasantly surprised how lively things can be at English clubs. Things have changed in that department but there is still room for socialising when the time is right.' </p> <p>The beer is certainly likely to flow if Bolton overcome Villa this afternoon.

'I wasn't fully involved. It was a mixed day because of that. </p> <p>'Being in the starting line-up it feels more special.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There were people who thought that the Columbine massacre on 20 April 1999 would change everything in Hollywood; that this one event would be so scarring it would change attitudes towards screen violence forever. Some hoped Hollywood would be shocked out of an addiction that goes right back to the Great Train Robbery in 1904. Others feared a backlash that would deprive us of the next Goodfellas or Bonnie And Clyde . But it only takes a couple of minutes of Scream 3 to put everything that was said in the weeks after Littleton out of your mind, or just as much time as elapses before the Munch-masked killer slashes again. </p> <p>But there is something more complex going on: after all, the Scream movies have always played with idea that movies do inspire violence. There is the terrifying 'Do you like scary movies?' phone call that opens the first film. And Scream 2 starts with a 'fictional' version of the same scene playing in a cinema while the new killer strikes, hidden in a room full of ghoulish mask-wearing fans. Scream 3 pushes the game further, taking place on the set of its fictional alter ego Stab 3 and tracing the roots of the killings back into the sleazy world of Seventies Hollywood. But near the end, the film takes a stand. As the heroine confronts the unmasked murderer she brushes away the killer's attempts to shift the blame. ' You chose to kill. It's time to take responsibility for your actions.' A couple of minutes later, she pulls the trigger: in Hollywood, the only way to counter violence is always with violence. </p> <p>Whatever vague noises of contrition were made a year ago, including the postponement of two episodes of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (later shown), Hollywood is not going to carry the can for US murder rates. As Scream 3 producer Cathy Konrad says: 'I have a conscience, but I don't think that in the spirit of entertainment, you can take it to the point where you're censoring yourself.' </p> <p> In the wake of the Littleton massacre, the Clinton administration tried to yoke the entertainment industry in with the gun lobby, asking both to clean up their acts, as if they were equally culpable. But no one in Hollywood was willing to put their hand up and take the blame. Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association Of America and the only major entertainment industry figure to go to a White House summit with the gun manufacturers, took solace from an interview with a Columbine student. 'If the media was at fault,' Valenti recalled the girl saying, 'everyone of the 1,850 students at Columbine would be killers because the students all watch the same movies and TV programmes, listen to the same music, play the same video games.' Another student said it was not the media, but rather that the two killers were crazy. </p> <p>And just as it turned out that the killers were not fans of Marilyn Manson after all, there was some kind of strange absolution for Buffy - centrepiece show of the teencentric WB network - as well. 'You know what I hate?' wrote Columbine killer Eric Harris in his journal, 'The WB network!!!! Oh Jesus, Mary Mother of God Almighty, I hate that channel with all my heart and soul.' </p> <p> In the summer and early autumn of last year, it looked as if Hollywood still had a tough time ahead. In September, the Senate Committee On The Judiciary issued a report on media violence that tried to end more than 40 years of fierce academic argument: </p> <p>\"The debate is over,' begins a position paper on media violence by the American Psychiatric Association. 'For the last three decades, the one predominant finding in research on the mass media is that exposure to media portrayals of violence increases aggressive behaviour in children.' In the words of Jeffrey McIntyre, legislative and federal affairs officer for the American Psychological Association: 'To argue against it is like arguing against gravity.' </p> <p>Of course, there are plenty of academics willing to contradict these sweeping statements, but the Senate was not listening to them. At the heart of the political reaction were a trio who have long been obsessed by violent entertainment: ex-Reagan Cabinet member William Bennett and right-wing Senators Joseph Lieberman and Sam Brownback. They had a powerful ally in Senator John McCain. </p> <p>In June McCain had sponsored the Media Violence Labeling Act Of 1999. If it becomes law, the Bill will give the self-regulatory bodies dealing with movies, TV, music and video games 180 days to come up with a joint voluntary warning system on violence. If not, the government would step in and impose one. This would be an enormous change in the US, where anything that can be construed as state censorship is normally considered impossible under the First Amendment protecting free speech. </p> <p>'The fact is, this is really a Bill of last resort,' argued Lieberman's press secretary, Dan Gerstein. 'We have pleaded with, cajoled, coaxed the entertainment industry to assert more self-control and self-restraint with their products. If the industry is going to continue to act as it does and not even acknowledge that it has responsibilities, we think legislation is a very reasonable alternative.' </p> <p>It looks unlikely, however, that the Bill will become law. It has been on the committee stage backburner since July, with McCain otherwise occupied in his presidential campaign. Meanwhile, Clinton had set up a Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigation to discover whether the entertainment industry was marketing adult-labelled products at children. This - like McCain's Bill - was modelled on successful moves against the tobacco industry. Commission chairman Robert Pitofsky made clear he considered there was no longer any debate about the effects of violent cultural products. 'By desensitising young people to the consequences of violence, by making violence seem commonplace, by a cumulative celebration of the effectiveness of violence, we make violent behaviour more likely to occur.' </p> <p>In theory, the commission report - scheduled to be released in late summer - could open the studios and networks up to legal action on the grounds that they have broken their self-imposed regulations. It remains the biggest threat to the media. But proving that kind of intent is always tricky </p> <p>It looked as if the government was searching for anything it could do, short of regulation. For instance, government agencies now have to consider a TV show's violence level before granting a permit to film on federal property. Encouraged by the President, the National Association of Theatre Owners brought in an identity card policy in June. There was some doubt about what effect it would have. 'The other presidential gambit - the carding of under-17-year-olds trying to sneak into R-rated movies - is pork for the phony-ID market and unenforceable at any multiplex with more screens than ticket-checking employees,' wrote Frank Rich of the New York Times . The new carding system was vigorously enforced for a couple of months, and then everything went back to normal. </p> <p>Constrained by the First Amendment, the administration's primary hope seems to have been shaming the entertainment multinationals into changing their ways. But they would not take the bait. Their reasoning remains that countries such as Japan can be as addicted as the US to screen violence without corresponding bloodletting on the streets. So it was business as usual at the cinemas: one of the big autumn hits was Double Jeopardy , in which wrongly convicted Ashley Judd arms herself and takes the law into her own hands. The two biggest confrontations between film makers and the ratings board were produced by Summer of Sam and American Psycho . As both films involve serial killers, you might expect violence to be the problem. It was not: as with Eyes Wide Shut , the issue was sex scenes involving more than two people. </p> <p> The big test of Hollywood's post-Columbine attitude was meant to be Fight Club . When it was screened for the press in October, Anita M. Busch, editor of trade paper the Hollywood Reporter wrote, in a news report short on named sources: 'Many claimed the film was \"socially irresponsible\" and couldn't have come at a worse time for Hollywood, which was under attack by Washington since the Columbine shootings.' In an editorial, she added: 'Those responsible for bringing Fight Club to the screen - agents, financiers, studio executives - should hang their head for setting the entire industry back.' </p> <p>David Poland, TV producer turned Hollywood pundit, responded: 'When was the last time you heard any real noise about Hollywood violence and legislation? It's been months. And look how the Columbine/ Matrix connection hurt that film. It was the biggest selling DVD title in history and started out as the biggest rental title of the year. Every movie should suffer such controversy.' </p> <p>Before Fight Club was released, it was assumed it would be a huge hit, and would almost certainly set off copycat incidents. It was not a hit, and the only report of an event 'inspired' by the film I could find was about a high school fight watched by 100 pupils or so. This kind of thing happened long before Brad Pitt was born. Meanwhile, those Matrix sequels rushed into production. And in Britain, the climate seems to have grown more, not less, liberal. It's still strange to see long banned titles such as The Driller Killer, The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the local video shop. </p> <p>As we approach the first anniversary of the Columbine massacre, the debate will return. But not for long. One industry fixer said: 'That's an interesting question. But I can't say I have given it a moment's thought.' Consider some facts: McCain never used his anti-media violence credentials in his campaign. Martial arts movie Romeo Must Die is number two at the US box-office. The Sopranos , and its even more violent channel mate Oz , continue to be showered in critical acclaim. And the Clinton administration's attempt to balance the media and the gun lobby ended when National Rifle Association executive vice-president Wayne Lapierre launched a bizarre attack on Clinton. 'I've come to believe he needs a certain level of violence in this country. He's willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda. And the Vice-President, too.' Al Gore swiftly announced that gun control would be a central issue in his campaign. </p> <p>'The only major movie that could be considered to be affected by Littleton is Charlie's Angels ,' says David Poland, 'Peace loving, gentle Drew Barrymore apparently insisted the women not carry guns. And what has that 'feelgood' attitude brought to that film? Some of the worst word-of-mouth on the planet.'</p>",

The two biggest confrontations between film makers and the ratings board were produced by Summer of Sam and American Psycho . As both films involve serial killers, you might expect violence to be the problem. It was not: as with Eyes Wide Shut , the issue was sex scenes involving more than two people. The big test of Hollywood's post-Columbine attitude was meant to be Fight Club . When it was screened for the press in October, Anita M. Busch, editor of trade paper the Hollywood Reporter wrote, in a news report short on named sources: 'Many claimed the film was \"socially irresponsible\" and couldn't have come at a worse time for Hollywood, which was under attack by Washington since the Columbine shootings.' In an editorial, she added: 'Those responsible for bringing Fight Club to the screen - agents, financiers, studio executives - should hang their head for setting the entire industry back.' David Poland, TV producer turned Hollywood pundit, responded: 'When was the last time you heard any real noise about Hollywood violence and legislation? It's been months. And look how the Columbine/ Matrix connection hurt that film. It was the biggest selling DVD title in history and started out as the biggest rental title of the year. Every movie should suffer such controversy.' Before Fight Club was released, it was assumed it would be a huge hit, and would almost certainly set off copycat incidents. It was not a hit, and the only report of an event 'inspired' by the film I could find was about a high school fight watched by 100 pupils or so. This kind of thing happened long before Brad Pitt was born. Meanwhile, those Matrix sequels rushed into production. And in Britain, the climate seems to have grown more, not less, liberal. It's still strange to see long banned titles such as The Driller Killer, The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the local video shop. As we approach the first anniversary of the Columbine massacre, the debate will return. But not for long. One industry fixer said: 'That's an interesting question. But I can't say I have given it a moment's thought.' Consider some facts: McCain never used his anti-media violence credentials in his campaign. Martial arts movie Romeo Must Die is number two at the US box-office. The Sopranos , and its even more violent channel mate Oz , continue to be showered in critical acclaim. And the Clinton administration's attempt to balance the media and the gun lobby ended when National Rifle Association executive vice-president Wayne Lapierre launched a bizarre attack on Clinton. 'I've come to believe he needs a certain level of violence in this country. He's willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda. And the Vice-President, too.' Al Gore swiftly announced that gun control would be a central issue in his campaign. 'The only major movie that could be considered to be affected by Littleton is Charlie's Angels ,' says David Poland, 'Peace loving, gentle Drew Barrymore apparently insisted the women not carry guns. And what has that 'feelgood' attitude brought to that film? Some of the worst word-of-mouth on the planet.'",

      "body": "<p> Here's something for you to try at home, as the sticky-backed plastic brigade used to say on Blue Peter. Make a pot of tea - it helps if you use the industrial-strength stuff favoured by builders - and leave the bags to macerate for 10 minutes. Now come back and take a sip. Seriously nasty, right? That's why airline tea always tastes so vile, especially if you're the last to be served in steerage. </p> <p>Stewed tea tastes horrid because of excess tannin. The same is true of wine, which is why dry, mouth-puckering reds are some of the nastiest liquids in the world. This doesn't stop a lot of producers making bitter, astringent reds, mind you. The explanation? Sometimes it's machismo - a female colleague was once asked if she liked men when she criticised a Barolo producer's wines. But usually it's incompetence - wines that have been fermented too warm or left in contact with their skins, seeds and sometimes stems for too long. Ageing in new oak barrels can also add to a wine's tannic overload if it's done badly. So can rough treatment of the grapes before fermentation. </p> <p>Some grape varieties are more tannic than others. The heavyweights include Tannat (an easy one to remember), Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Malbec, although climate and winemaking style can alter this to a degree - a Malbec from Argentina has a lot more fruit than one from Cahors, for example. In Madiran, where Tannat is the local grape, producer Patrick Ducournau has developed a Heath Robinson-like contraption for bubbling oxygen through wine to soften its tannins in tank. Prolonged barrel ageing in older wood has a similar effect. </p> <p>When I started writing about wine, I was told that young reds had to be forbiddingly tannic to age well. 'It may seem nasty to you, young man,' a senior figure told me as I pulled a face worthy of the commedia dell'arte, 'but come back in 15 years.' I did, and I was right all along. Giving a wine time to develop complexity is all well and good, but only if it's worth the wait. </p> <p>In recent years, producers have developed a better understanding of tannin and how to extract it. In particular, they've realised that you can have your gateau and still stuff your face. As Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards in California puts it: 'A great wine should be drinkable at every stage of its development.' In other words, red wines need tannins, but they don't have to be hard and astringent ones. </p> <p>That's part of the reason why red wine styles have softened over the last decade. You only have to taste young classed growth Bordeaux or modern Barolo to see how much things have changed. The other crucial factor is the rise of the New World and the emphasis on softness and accessibility. I have a few reservations about this, but in general it's been a good thing, emphasising fruit as well as structure. </p> <p>By absolute standards, Bordeaux and Barolo are still pretty tannic wines. If you don't like the flavour - or, strictly speaking, the sensation - of tannin on the side of your gums, chose a wine made entirely or substantially from softer grapes: Gamay, Grenache, Corvina, Tempranillo or Pinot Noir. Who knows, things might even perk up in steerage if the airlines switched to Earl Grey tea.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here's something for you to try at home, as the sticky-backed plastic brigade used to say on Blue Peter. Make a pot of tea - it helps if you use the industrial-strength stuff favoured by builders - and leave the bags to macerate for 10 minutes. Now come back and take a sip. Seriously nasty, right? That's why airline tea always tastes so vile, especially if you're the last to be served in steerage. Stewed tea tastes horrid because of excess tannin. The same is true of wine, which is why dry, mouth-puckering reds are some of the nastiest liquids in the world. This doesn't stop a lot of producers making bitter, astringent reds, mind you. The explanation? Sometimes it's machismo - a female colleague was once asked if she liked men when she criticised a Barolo producer's wines. But usually it's incompetence - wines that have been fermented too warm or left in contact with their skins, seeds and sometimes stems for too long. Ageing in new oak barrels can also add to a wine's tannic overload if it's done badly. So can rough treatment of the grapes before fermentation. Some grape varieties are more tannic than others. The heavyweights include Tannat (an easy one to remember), Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Malbec, although climate and winemaking style can alter this to a degree - a Malbec from Argentina has a lot more fruit than one from Cahors, for example. In Madiran, where Tannat is the local grape, producer Patrick Ducournau has developed a Heath Robinson-like contraption for bubbling oxygen through wine to soften its tannins in tank. Prolonged barrel ageing in older wood has a similar effect. When I started writing about wine, I was told that young reds had to be forbiddingly tannic to age well. 'It may seem nasty to you, young man,' a senior figure told me as I pulled a face worthy of the commedia dell'arte, 'but come back in 15 years.' I did, and I was right all along. Giving a wine time to develop complexity is all well and good, but only if it's worth the wait. In recent years, producers have developed a better understanding of tannin and how to extract it. In particular, they've realised that you can have your gateau and still stuff your face. As Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards in California puts it: 'A great wine should be drinkable at every stage of its development.' In other words, red wines need tannins, but they don't have to be hard and astringent ones. That's part of the reason why red wine styles have softened over the last decade. You only have to taste young classed growth Bordeaux or modern Barolo to see how much things have changed. The other crucial factor is the rise of the New World and the emphasis on softness and accessibility. I have a few reservations about this, but in general it's been a good thing, emphasising fruit as well as structure. By absolute standards, Bordeaux and Barolo are still pretty tannic wines. If you don't like the flavour - or, strictly speaking, the sensation - of tannin on the side of your gums, chose a wine made entirely or substantially from softer grapes: Gamay, Grenache, Corvina, Tempranillo or Pinot Noir. Who knows, things might even perk up in steerage if the airlines switched to Earl Grey tea.",

      "body": "<p>I regret never having cooked for my mother. Not a bun nor a biscuit, not even a rock cake on Mother's Day. How I would have loved to have walked upstairs with a tray of warm biscuits, or better still a butterfly cake for her. It is to my eternal embarrassment that I always forgot Mother's Day until it was too late even to scribble a card, and I wince every time I remember my father annually handing me a box of Black Magic for her and grumbling, 'I knew you would forget.' </p> <p>Can there be any gift so well received as that of some food a child has made? A knobbly muffin etched with purple veins of blueberry juice; a fairy cake with its thin crown of icing that breaks softly as you tear away its paper case; a tray of shortbread embossed with your little darling's fingerprints. And who could possibly get cross about the mess that a cooking child is certain to create? (The chocolate biscuits below are guaranteed to turn your kitchen into something resembling a wet day at Glastonbury.) But I think we must simply suffer it. There is something about the gift of a handmade cake that brings a lump to my throat. </p> <p>I have noticed how much children like to cook sweet things at first, presumably progressing to the savoury stuff once they have made themselves sick on home-made coconut fudge and chocolate truffles. There is nothing wrong with this, really, despite the fact it is not what we want them to eat. You would have to have a heart of steel not to smile as you swallow the teeth-juddering sweetness of your little one's handmade and much-fingered peppermint creams. </p> <p>If Daddy is orchestrating some hastily made edible gifts this morning, then may I suggest fairy cakes? No, of course you won't be able to find paper cake cases at the newspaper shop, but nothing could be more straightforward, except perhaps the aforementioned rock cakes. Actually, I have a soft spot for rock cakes, partly because they were one of my first successes. Such sweet things can be made in minutes, providing the butter is at room temperature and will be out of the oven in a quarter of an hour and long before Mum's out of bed. I suggest such old-fashioned and simple recipes partly because for most very young cooks, the speed at which your handiwork is ready for consumption comes second only to how much mess you can make. </p> <p>I shudder to mention scones because they sound so predictable and unimaginative, but any reticence melts away at the first mouthful of the warm crumbs with cream and a quivering dollop of jam. No recipe is guaranteed to work so unfailingly, and so basic are the ingredients and method that they could be baked this afternoon in time for tea without looking like an afterthought. </p> <p>My first loaf of bread is probably still on the lawn of my childhood home where it was thrown out for the birds 20 years ago. I can't blame anyone for not wanting it - you couldn't actually get a knife through it - but most of us will overlook the shortcomings of a child's first attempt at baking. Surely we should do everything to encourage our children to cook, even if it does mean swallowing the occasional failure. </p> <p>If your child is beyond such simple recipes, (and may I ask which little over-achiever could possibly be beyond a rock cake warm from the oven), then you might like to sneak a family cake recipe in front of them. That way you might end up with a light and airy Victoria sandwich, perhaps, or a plain and peaceful Madeira cake. Oh, why does no one ever make Madeira cake any more? If you had the foresight to get some eggs and greaseproof paper in yesterday, then you might even wake up to a Swiss roll. Unless, that is, you were my mother, in which case you would have woken up to nothing but a box of Black Magic and a guilty little grin. </p> <p> <strong> Butterfly cakes</strong><br> Sweet nothings that are simple to make and far too easy to eat. I say that because I only meant to nibble a wing and ended up eating four. I made several attempts at a lighter, less sweet alternative to the classic filling using mascarpone and fromage frais, but the traditional buttercream won hands down. I shall not argue. Makes about 16. </p> <p>125g butter <br>125g golden caster sugar <br>2 large eggs <br>the finely grated zest of 1 small orange <br>125g self-raising flour <br>1 tsp of baking powder </p> <p><strong> for the buttercream</strong> <br> 200g butter, softened <br>400g golden icing sugar <br>1 tsp of finely grated orange or lemon zest </p> <p>Get the oven hot (it needs to be at 200 \u00b0C/gas mark 6), then line muffin or bun tins with paper cake cases. For want of a bun tin, I have previously just put the cases on a baking sheet; they were fine, if a bit wobbly. But don't even think of making them without the paper cases - they stick even to a non-stick bun tin. </p> <p>Beat the butter and sugar until it is light and very fluffy. This is easiest with an electric mixer or hand-held electric beater; if you want to do it by hand with a wooden spoon, then make certain the butter is soft, though not melted, before you start. Beat in the eggs, orange zest, flour and baking powder. Spoon the mixture into the paper cake cases, half filling each one, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until they are pale gold and well risen. Remove the cakes from the bun tins and put on a rack to cool. </p> <p>Make the buttercream. Beat the sugar and butter together till they form a soft cream, then beat in the zest. Cut a slice from the top of each cake and cut each slice in half. Put a heaped teaspoon of buttercream on top of each cake and push in the slices to suggest wings. </p> <p> <strong> Chocolate fork biscuits</strong><br> A treat is only truly a treat when it is something in which we wouldn't normally indulge. In this case, large quantities of butter, sugar and chocolate. No apologies here: it is not every week I suggest anyone make chocolate biscuits. I have made these soft, bittersweet cookies and their melting chocolate filling many times over the years and am constantly surprised just how anything so rich could disappear quite so quickly. Makes 12. </p> <p><strong> for the biscuits</strong><br> 250g butter, at room temperature <br>125g golden caster sugar <br>250g self-raising flour <br>60g cocoa powder </p> <p><strong> for the buttercream filling</strong><br> 100g butter <br>200g icing sugar <br>2 tbsps very strong espresso </p> <p> <strong> for dusting</strong><br> a little cocoa and icing sugar </p> <p>Cream the butter and sugar together until thick and creamy. This is much more easily done with an electric beater. Sift the flour and cocoa together, then fold into the creamed butter and sugar. You will end up with a thick, creamy dough. Chill for 30 minutes. </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6. Take level tablespoons of the mixture and roll them into balls. It is best to do this quickly, so that the dough does not become sticky in the hand. Place the balls of rolled dough on a non-stick baking sheet or one lined with bakewell paper, allowing about 2cm between them. Press firmly on each ball of dough with the prongs of a fork, to flatten the biscuit and to give it a ridged top. </p> <p>Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, leave to cool for a few minutes before lifting them carefully from the tray with a palette knife to a cooling rack, then roll out more of the dough and repeat. </p> <p>For the filling, beat the sugar and butter together till they form a soft cream, then beat in the coffee. Leave in the fridge to firm a little, then spread half of the cooled biscuits with it. Sandwich the biscuits together with the buttercream, then dust with the finely sifted cocoa and sugar. </p> <p> <strong> Plain scones</strong> <br> Lovely, old-fashioned, no-nonsense scones. Makes 12. </p> <p>225g plain flour <br>2 tsps baking powder <br>50g butter <br>1 tbsp golden caster sugar <br>1 egg, beaten and made up to 150ml with milk <br>a little milk to glaze </p> <p>Set the oven at 220\u00b0C/gas mark 7. Mix the flour in a sieve with the baking powder and a good pinch of salt, then sieve it into a bowl. Dice the butter and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until you have what looks like a bowl of breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar, then pour in the beaten egg and milk. Bring the dough together with your hands to form a ball. </p> <p>Pat out the dough into a round about 2cm thick. Using a cookie cutter or small cup, cut out circles of dough and place them well apart on a baking sheet. .Brush with a little milk, then bake for 10-12 minutes till risen and golden. </p> <p> <strong> Blueberry buttermilk muffins</strong><br> Buttermilk - the liquid that is left over when milk has been churned into butter - is becoming easier to find now. All the supermarkets seem to have it. I include it here not solely for its pleasing mild acidity, but for its ability to make the muffins lighter. But you shouldn't worry if milk is all you have, the little cakes will be fine. I find these the easiest of all baking, you can make them in minutes. Those more organised than myself might even like to make them for breakfast. Makes 12. </p> <p>250g plain flour <br>1 level tsp baking powder <br>4 level tbsps caster sugar <br>1 medium egg <br>grated zest of 1 small orange <br>225ml buttermilk or milk <br>50g butter, melted <br>225g blueberries </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then stir in the caster sugar and teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and add the orange zest and the buttermilk. Stir in the melted butter, then pour the mixture into the flour. Stir for half a dozen strokes, then stop. The batter will look somewhat dodgy at this point, but don't let that worry you - the point is not to overmix, and it will sort itself out in the oven. </p> <p>Divide the mixture between 12 muffin tins lined with paper cases, then drop a few blueberries into each one. Cover with the remaining mixture. Bake in the centre of the preheated oven till risen and golden.</p>",

I cannot get enough of them. I have always thought of violets as precious little flowers, gems dotted on a woodland bank or in the corner of a border that might make a tiny bunch. But a couple of hundred plants - cheap when bought in bulk - have all come up to achieve a mass experience that, for the price of a night in a cheap London hotel, has given all of us weeks of delight.

Could this be too much of a good thing? A surfeit of violets? Not yet, for sure.</p> <p>Viola odorata is a perennial that starts flowering in late February through to April. Most of the flowers are - er - violet, but quite a few vary, going from white through pink and lilac. The American Viola blanda, or sweet white violet, grows with reliably pure white flowers and, like so many white plants, thrives in a cooler, more shady spot than its transatlantic coloured cousin. Amateur botanists once amused themselves by giving every colour variation recognition as a variety in its own right. This was tempered down to a mere 28 species, subspecies and hybrids. But it is the path where horticulture and gardening diverge sharply. I will stick with gardening. </p> <p>Violets produce a repeat crop of flowers in autumn, but the autumn flowers are tiny and scentless and usually hidden under the leaves. The main curiosity of this dual-flowering system is that the first flowering is rich with scent and honey and perfect for pollination by bees - although there are rarely any bees about at that time of year so they hardly ever get pollinated and do not set seed. The second flush, however, is heavy with seed, despite the lack of incentive to pollinators. This is because the flowers are self-fertilising. The plant also throws out runners after flowering, rather like strawberries, neatly obviating the need for seed. </p> <p>So, given the right conditions, it is possible to establish a mat of violets from a few plants. Perfect conditions are light deciduous shade in summer but with spring and autumn sunshine and a cool root run in rich, loose, leafy soil. All these conditions arise naturally on woodland or hedgerow banks and in the garden where deciduous shrubs dominate. The plants do not mind being moved around and the best time to do this is in early spring, before they flower. If they spread and grow healthily without flowering, moving them usually does the trick and results in flowers next season. There is a theory that they only grow well in unpolluted atmospheres because the hairy underside of the leaves catches grit, which in turn blocks the pores. I have no evidence of this and would be glad to hear from any urban gardener successfully growing violets in the midst of inner-city grime (<a href=\"'mailto:montydon@btclick.com'\">montydon@bt.com</a>).</p> <p>Violets have been part of man's cultivated floral landscape for a long time. They are native to almost all of Europe down to North Africa and as far east as Iran, and are portrayed at Knossos in frescoes painted around four thousand years ago. The Greeks used violets to 'comfort and strengthen the heart'. The Romans loved them and made a sweet wine from the flowers. They were important to medieval gardeners as a reminder of the sweetness and humility of the Virgin Mary, and, more practically, as a stewing herb - the flowers spread on the floor in among other plants to sweeten the rankness of floors that resembled byres more than anything else. </p> <p>They were also made into a syrup and used as a cure for coughs and colds and insomnia, and as a laxative. On the web (<a href=\"http://www.sweetviolet.com\">sweetviolet.com</a>) you will find them still in use for exactly these things. The purity associated with the plant has a black side because it is also associated with death, especially of children. The vision of a little grave adorned with violets and primroses in spring is more than imagination can bear.</p> <p>Violas are violets transmuted by garden sophistry. There are more than 400 species to choose from, which seem to be derived mainly from complex interbreeding. James Grieve, he of the eponymous apple, began breeding violas in Edinburgh in the 19th century, starting with V tricolor, or heartsease, V cornuta, from the Pyrenees, and V lutea, which, when crossed with heartsease, produced the original pansy, V x wittrockiana. Violettas differ from violas only in that they do not have whiskers radiating from the centre of the flowers - so I am told. </p> <p>It is strange that so many people think no window box, hanging basket or ribbon bed is complete without dozens of winter-flowering pansies and the gaudy, big-petalled spring pansies which, for all their undoubted attraction, only last a year or, at most, two, and lack the delicate charm of all those hundreds of violas. 'Bowles' Black' is my favourite, out of the half a dozen or so that I am acquainted with, as much for its toughness as its tiny furry, inky black petals and centres like yellow stars, but if black is your colour, and black flowers are always special, 'Molly Sanderson' is a bigger, neater black viola with tiny yellow cores, and 'Penny Black' is a pansy that is short-lived but will come true from seed, so keep popping up. </p> <p>I also love the purple, yellow and white of the basic Viola tricolor, but then who could fail to love a flower called heartsease? We let it grow semi-wild among the herbs and shear it to the ground in midsummer. It might seem drastic but all violas respond well to this treatment, producing another crop of blooms within a month. I see that in Sarah Raven's new book The Bold &amp; Brilliant Garden (Frances Lincoln, \u00a325) she recommends 'Roscastle Black', which is as intense a purple as purple can be without imploding, vermilion 'Padparadja' and 'Jolly Joker', with orange centres against deep-purple outsides and the top two petals all purple. The darker the colours, the more they like to be shaded, but all violas do best if they are not allowed to dry out too much.</p> <p>V. riviniana 'Purpurea' (formerly called V. labradorica) has pale violet flowers but is grown primarily for its purple, almost chocolate-tinged leaves, which are especially marked in spring. </p> <p><strong>Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong><br> Observer readers can order six Viola 'Eye of the Tiger', supplied as cell-raised plants, for \u00a39.99, including UK p&amp;p.

      "bodyText": "First, fans of Harry Potter learn that their young hero is to get a girlfriend in his next book. Now a heavy dose of romance is to be introduced into the $200 million screen version of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to extend its appeal beyond the traditional young male readers of the book. Director Peter Jackson, currently shooting the first of three films devoted to the saga, has drafted in some smoother female forms to supplement the hairy feet, pointed ears and flashing axe-blades of Tolkien's heroes - and upset many fans of Middle Earth in the process. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are to play Arwen and Galadriel, roles which were marginal in the original story but are now greatly enlarged in the screenplay. The love story between Arwen, Elven princess of Rivendell, and Aragorn, heir to the Dunedain kingdoms, played by Viggo Mortensen, has also been given greater prominence, according to reports from the film's closed set in New Zealand. Hobbit fans fear the essence of Tolkien's 63-year-old work will be lost. In an effort to reach a wide cinematic audience.

The titanic figure of Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez wrote a full-page essay about Eli\u00e1n in the New York Times. The Virgin Mary is said to have been appearing in the boy's mirror at the house where he is staying as a foster-child/hostage with his great-uncle, L\u00e1zaro, in Miami. An interview on Good Morning America revealed Eli\u00e1n believes that his mother - drowned the day he was rescued - is still alive and suffering from amnesia.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Havana, Castro is using much the old rhetoric, threatening to dispatch guerrilla snatch squads to bring the boy home. And just as the first exiles in Miami went into training to form the 'Alpha 66' group which vowed to overthrow communism, so the Miami Cubans are under instruction again - in civil disobedience methods, aiming to thwart the platoon from the Immigration and Naturalisation Service whose job it would or will be to frogmarch Eli\u00e1n physically onto the plane bound for Havana - if it dares.</p> <p>Tomorrow 'talks resume' - as they have done ever since the boy was found washed ashore clinging to a tyre last Thanksgiving Day. Eli\u00e1n's father was due to come and collect his son last week, but now - himself an effective hostage of the Castro regime - has trouble in Havana with his 'travel plans'.</p> <p>The formal expiry of Eli\u00e1n's leave to stay in the US passed on Friday, as everyone knew it would. Now the impasse is total: the federal court has ruled that only Attorney-General Janet Reno can grant Eli\u00e1n asylum in the United States. The political decision has been made: she has refused to do so.</p> <p>Eli\u00e1n's Miami relatives have duly appealed, and rejected an ultimatum that they comply by the outcome of that appeal, due to be heard in Atlanta next month. The outcome now exists - and the poor boy himself is caught - in an explosive zone between the law, politics, supercharged emotions and mass media on the point of orgasm.</p> <p>The case of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez is just politics - everyone knows that. But few could have predicted quite how raw this Realpolitik was going to be. President Bill Clinton is head of the administration that has opted to reunite Eli\u00e1n with his father and country, but his Freudian 'son', Al Gore, has other things to worry about.</p> <p>Like the fact that Florida is the fourth biggest voting bloc in the United States, and that Clinton's victory was in no small part due to the intricate negotiations with the quasi-mobster leader of the Cuban hard Right in Miami, the late Jorge Mas Canosa, whereby Canosa won from the would-be President a more punitive embargo deal against Havana than he had extracted from either Ronald Reagan or George Bush Snr.</p> <p>What a shame for Al Gore to throw that away, which he would do in a stroke if he were seen to back the INS when it comes for little Eli\u00e1n. And so Al Gore has staged his most defiant rebellion yet against his mentor-President by taking a stand in favour of the Miami Cubans and backing Republican-sponsored legislation on Capitol Hill which could create something of a crisis by pitching an Act of Congress against the outcome of the Atlanta court hearing.</p> <p>In a media-dominated post-Monica world, the raw matter of politics is neither ideology nor intercontinental ballistic missiles but a rip-roaring real-life soap opera. Inevitably, the US media - with the Clinton family epic losing ratings currency - has not let such a golden opportunity as the Eli\u00e1n drama pass it by. The Miami Cubans and Eli\u00e1n's relatives in the US have ensured that the media frenzy portrays the right message to their compatriots: Eli\u00e1n is now an all-American kid, fully initiated into the forbidden world of Disneyland, just up the road but a world away from Cuba, in Orlando.</p> <p>But, as in 1961, Castro has risen to the challenge masterfully, with all the artful genius of the best Washington consultancy. Despite the fact that more Cubans than ever are trying to cross the straits to Florida on rafts and boats, Fidel has mobilised millions around the case of 'Nuestro Ni\u00f1o' - our boy - whose face is more familiar to Cubans than any movie star to the American public.</p> <p>The opposing camps of Fidel's Havana and Mas Canosa's Miami have suited each other's purposes for nearly three decades; each opposed but respected the other, each needed the other, each was the other's bogeyman. It was the revolution versus the embargo. But Cubans are now exposed to more American influences, and vice versa. There is a meeting of musical minds and young cultural movements; schools of art and architecture in Cuba are open to American influence; Internet, tourist and sporting connections have made a tragic farce out of Castro's isolationism.</p> <p>In Miami, the Cuban community has been swollen by wave after wave of younger defectors who care as little for the hardline, right-wing politics of Mas Canosa's generation as they do for the communist dogma they left behind.</p> <p>The Cuban authorities do not usually arrest people seeking to leave the way that Eli\u00e1n left, but now would-be escapees are being taken to the Villa Marista, interrogated and beaten. 'One boy,' says an activist by telephone from Havana, 'has changed the policy'.</p> <p>Last month Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, president of the Cuban Commission on Human Rights, reported that the four months leading up to this March - months of fever pitch in the Eli\u00e1n saga - had witnessed 'the largest number of acts of political repression in the last ten years'. Some 592 activists had been arrested or had their freedom of movement restricted.</p> <p>The embargo, sacred to the Canosa camp, is not only pointless but an obstruction to the new immigrants, whose secondary concern after their own interests is to earn money and send it home to their relatives.</p> <p>Two recent arrivals in Miami epitomise the thaw.

It's only bloody Greta Garbo wearing nothing but a nightie. \"Pieter. Pieter, let me in.\" Had to poke her off the windowsill with a broomstick.' </p> <p>This, to all intents and purposes, is the book of that sketch: the story of how 23-year-old Colin Clark gently but firmly refused to give Marilyn Monroe one. It's a pioneering, postmodern genre piece - the Not Kiss and Tell. </p> <p>At the time of the events recounted in this slight, diverting memoir, Clark was working on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl as a junior gofer. He reminds us repeatedly that, as third assistant director, he was 'the lowest of the low', but the net impression of his story is hilariously boastful. </p> <p>It soon emerges he is the only person on the set who can see beyond the Monroe glamour to the vulnerable, frightened little girl inside. 'She seemed to be addressing me directly, like a figure in a dream,' he writes early on, 'as if her spirit was calling out to mine.' Monroe seems to feel the same. She flirts with him, doing everything Monroe is supposed to do. They spend a delightful few days together; he even gets a snog. </p> <p>Colin is utterly beguiled, but she is married to Arthur Miller and he is a decent stick and doesn't take advantage. He contents himself with dispensing well-meaning and pompous advice, which he reproduces: 'You are like a beautiful force of nature, Marilyn, for ever out of reach.' It's hard to be absolutely sure he isn't simply sending his 23-year-old self up, deadpan. </p> <p>I'd like to have known rather more about how the volume was constructed or reconstructed. How extensive were his diaries? The longer monologues, offered as verbatim, certainly read as if they're written more from fancy than fact. It's enough to say that it's an absurd tale told absurdly, a schoolboyish crush reheated as a memoir. A little vain, a shade snobbish, but redeemed by candour and full of comedy. </p> <p>'This seemed to me pretty egotistical reasoning even by the standards of domestic servants,' he records at one point, and at another alludes knowingly to 'that wonderful, warm, moist scent which beautiful ladies give off when they sleep'. Elsewhere, there are sentences which do just beg to be read in Peter Cook's Dagenham drawl: 'It was incredibly exhilarating to be in the back seat of a smelly black Wolsey with Marilyn Monroe, speeding through the back entrance to Windsor Castle - but what would happen next?' </p> <p>Read and find out.</p>",

It's a pioneering, postmodern genre piece - the Not Kiss and Tell. At the time of the events recounted in this slight, diverting memoir, Clark was working on the set of The Prince and the Showgirl as a junior gofer. He reminds us repeatedly that, as third assistant director, he was 'the lowest of the low', but the net impression of his story is hilariously boastful. It soon emerges he is the only person on the set who can see beyond the Monroe glamour to the vulnerable, frightened little girl inside. 'She seemed to be addressing me directly, like a figure in a dream,' he writes early on, 'as if her spirit was calling out to mine.' Monroe seems to feel the same. She flirts with him, doing everything Monroe is supposed to do. They spend a delightful few days together; he even gets a snog. Colin is utterly beguiled, but she is married to Arthur Miller and he is a decent stick and doesn't take advantage. He contents himself with dispensing well-meaning and pompous advice, which he reproduces: 'You are like a beautiful force of nature, Marilyn, for ever out of reach.' It's hard to be absolutely sure he isn't simply sending his 23-year-old self up, deadpan. I'd like to have known rather more about how the volume was constructed or reconstructed. How extensive were his diaries? The longer monologues, offered as verbatim, certainly read as if they're written more from fancy than fact. It's enough to say that it's an absurd tale told absurdly, a schoolboyish crush reheated as a memoir. A little vain, a shade snobbish, but redeemed by candour and full of comedy. 'This seemed to me pretty egotistical reasoning even by the standards of domestic servants,' he records at one point, and at another alludes knowingly to 'that wonderful, warm, moist scent which beautiful ladies give off when they sleep'. Elsewhere, there are sentences which do just beg to be read in Peter Cook's Dagenham drawl: 'It was incredibly exhilarating to be in the back seat of a smelly black Wolsey with Marilyn Monroe, speeding through the back entrance to Windsor Castle - but what would happen next?'
