She would not look awkward serving in Tesco, which is probably why she appeals to an audience who give the impression of being no more into music than she is. With her ordinary songs and lines about getting \"closer to your dreams\", Mel sells that old fantasy of a regular girl made good, but with her mannered voice and theatrical moves veers between the insincere and the positively doolally.

Never Be the Same Again is an expected highlight, all the more remarkable because she does it without her Left Eye - that's Left Eye Lopez, from TLC, incidentally.

      "body": "<p>Thirty-five years after the rise of jazz-funk, the appearance of the electric bass guitar still occasions pitying expressions in some jazz circles. But Chris Minh Doky, the Danish double bassist and an admirer of the late bass-guitar legend Jaco Pastorius, does a remarkable job of delivering an electric bass's singing sound, guitar-like speed and bursts of funky percussiveness while sustaining the gravitas of his instrument. His melodic vocabulary balances jazz and pop references and the result is an open and lyrical repertoire that explores accessible melodic material with subtle and surprising improvisation. </p> <p>Minh Doky and his resourceful quartet delivered a varied and smooth set on Sunday that had the staff applauding as vehemently as the paying customers - not a bad sign in a jazz club.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-five years after the rise of jazz-funk, the appearance of the electric bass guitar still occasions pitying expressions in some jazz circles. But Chris Minh Doky, the Danish double bassist and an admirer of the late bass-guitar legend Jaco Pastorius, does a remarkable job of delivering an electric bass's singing sound, guitar-like speed and bursts of funky percussiveness while sustaining the gravitas of his instrument. His melodic vocabulary balances jazz and pop references and the result is an open and lyrical repertoire that explores accessible melodic material with subtle and surprising improvisation. Minh Doky and his resourceful quartet delivered a varied and smooth set on Sunday that had the staff applauding as vehemently as the paying customers - not a bad sign in a jazz club. Pat Metheny's fusion-oriented road bands were probably their nearest musical relatives. The Metheny connection was strongest in the early stages, with the fine young guitarist Adam Rogers reflecting the midwest guru's yearning high notes and legato runs, winding them around the tireless lope of the leader's double-time playing and keyboardist George Whitty's choppy chords.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Paul MacInnes</strong><br> Sunderland v Derby: Kevin Phillips first scorer \u00a35 @ 9/2 . </p> <p>First goalscorer, I'm afraid Mr MacInnes, is most definitely not the way forward. Many a bookies's Marbella retirement home is built on first goalscorer bets alone.</p> <p>But Phillips scored second, I hear you say. I was unlucky, I hear you add (it's a lonely life at the cutting edge of punting, I need these imaginary conversations). Phillips was, I admit, an obvious favourite for first goalscorer, with Sunderland most likely to score first and Phillips probably most likely to score first for Sunderland. But 9/2? I think not. </p> <p>Last season, when he had a quite phenomenal year, Phillips was first goalscorer in just six out of thirty-eight matches, which makes him over 5/1 on average. It is very hard to see either Phillips or Sunderland achieving anything like as much this season and for me that easily cancels out the fact that Derby look to be weak opponents. </p> <p>Given the vast margins bookies bet to on this market, a good bet is very hard to come by, particularly on the favourites. The only time you are likely to get value is if a player starts in an unfamiliar position. Matt Elliott, for example, occasionally plays centre-forward for Leicester and Scotland and if the bookies have priced him up as though he were a defender, albeit a goalscoring defender, then the chances are you'll get a good price if you realise he's playing up front before the bookies do. </p> <p>This, unfortunately, was not one of those occasions, Mr MacInnes but there is always next week.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong><br> Chelsea v Leicester: Leicester to lead at half-time \u00a35 @ 9/2.</p> <p>At last - we've waited five weeks for it, but Lord was it worth waiting for - a proper bet, and a winner to boot. Have I used the phrase 'opposing a bad favourite' before? I think I have, dear punter, I think I have. And Mr Murray, oh apple of my eye, glory to the clan, has seen the light and reaped the rewards. Hallelujah. </p> <p>Chelsea, as Mr M so rightly opined, are in disarray; Leicester are playing above themselves, as solid as solid can be. If the game was played under the same circumstances eleven times would Leicester win at least two of them? I think so. This is most decidedly my idea of a good bet because this is most decidedly my idea of value, a bet placed not necessarily with an expectation of winning but placed with the belief that if similar bets are placed over time enough will win to pay for the losers and then some.</p> <p>My only qualm with the bet would be the choice of the half-time result market rather than the full-time market - but this is just splitting hairs. Personally, I took a more conservative route in this match, backing Leicester on the Asian handicap, increasing my chances of winning but obviously at a worse price, because though I thought Chelsea very poor favourites I wasn't convinced Leicester could win it. But fortune favours the brave, much kudos is due to Mr M with his second winning bet in a row putting him firmly in the black.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle </strong><br> \u00a37.50 treble: Fulham to beat Nottingham Forest @ evens; Watford to beat Crewe @ 2/5; Wimbledon to beat Wolves @ 4/6 </p> <p>The injustice of it all. For 21 glorious minutes on Saturday the Ingle smugometer was off the scale as his three selections marched towards their inevitable victories. But alas the exotically named Joleon Lescott scored his first goal for Wolves to spoil the party. I know I'm just mean-spirited but I cheered as the news came through. The thought of the gloat-filled column I would be forced to read on Friday was just too much. </p> <p>I won't waste my time in criticising the inestimable Mr I this week, I trust Scott's success is a better lesson than any I could give. There was nothing much wrong with Sean's three selections, they all looked likely winners certainly, but were they value? With the possible exception of Fulham I would have to suggest that they were not. </p> <p>There is an old saying in sport - 'form is temporary, class is permanent' - and to an extent we should beware of backing teams in form. This is not so much because they can't be expected to maintain their form, but because their form will be well and truly reflected in the price as bookies know that punters back teams in form and thus keep their prices unnaturally short. </p> <p>The same is true of favourites in general - Mr Murray's performance this week shows the value to be had in backing against the favourite. If there is one piece of advice I would give to Mr Ingle, and indeed to you all, it is to stop looking for winners and start looking for value.</p> <p><strong>Danny Last of the Football Unlimited punter's collective </strong><br> \u00a310 treble: Wimbledon to beat Wolves @ 4/6, Brighton to beat Cheltenham @ 4/5, Livingston to beat Raith @ 8/15. </p> <p>Three picks all odds-on and only one winner. Alas Mr Last has been taking the advice of monkeys in leotards. Value not winners, it's the theme of the week.

      "bodyText": "Paul MacInnes Sunderland v Derby: Kevin Phillips first scorer \u00a35 @ 9/2 . First goalscorer, I'm afraid Mr MacInnes, is most definitely not the way forward. Many a bookies's Marbella retirement home is built on first goalscorer bets alone. But Phillips scored second, I hear you say. I was unlucky, I hear you add (it's a lonely life at the cutting edge of punting, I need these imaginary conversations). Phillips was, I admit, an obvious favourite for first goalscorer, with Sunderland most likely to score first and Phillips probably most likely to score first for Sunderland. But 9/2? I think not. Last season, when he had a quite phenomenal year, Phillips was first goalscorer in just six out of thirty-eight matches, which makes him over 5/1 on average. It is very hard to see either Phillips or Sunderland achieving anything like as much this season and for me that easily cancels out the fact that Derby look to be weak opponents. Given the vast margins bookies bet to on this market, a good bet is very hard to come by, particularly on the favourites. The only time you are likely to get value is if a player starts in an unfamiliar position. Matt Elliott, for example, occasionally plays centre-forward for Leicester and Scotland and if the bookies have priced him up as though he were a defender, albeit a goalscoring defender, then the chances are you'll get a good price if you realise he's playing up front before the bookies do. This, unfortunately, was not one of those occasions, Mr MacInnes but there is always next week. Scott Murray Chelsea v Leicester: Leicester to lead at half-time \u00a35 @ 9/2. At last - we've waited five weeks for it, but Lord was it worth waiting for - a proper bet, and a winner to boot. Have I used the phrase 'opposing a bad favourite' before? I think I have, dear punter, I think I have. And Mr Murray, oh apple of my eye, glory to the clan, has seen the light and reaped the rewards. Hallelujah. Chelsea, as Mr M so rightly opined, are in disarray; Leicester are playing above themselves, as solid as solid can be. If the game was played under the same circumstances eleven times would Leicester win at least two of them? I think so. This is most decidedly my idea of a good bet because this is most decidedly my idea of value, a bet placed not necessarily with an expectation of winning but placed with the belief that if similar bets are placed over time enough will win to pay for the losers and then some. My only qualm with the bet would be the choice of the half-time result market rather than the full-time market - but this is just splitting hairs. Personally, I took a more conservative route in this match, backing Leicester on the Asian handicap, increasing my chances of winning but obviously at a worse price, because though I thought Chelsea very poor favourites I wasn't convinced Leicester could win it. But fortune favours the brave, much kudos is due to Mr M with his second winning bet in a row putting him firmly in the black. Sean Ingle \u00a37.50 treble: Fulham to beat Nottingham Forest @ evens; Watford to beat Crewe @ 2/5; Wimbledon to beat Wolves @ 4/6 The injustice of it all. For 21 glorious minutes on Saturday the Ingle smugometer was off the scale as his three selections marched towards their inevitable victories. But alas the exotically named Joleon Lescott scored his first goal for Wolves to spoil the party. I know I'm just mean-spirited but I cheered as the news came through. The thought of the gloat-filled column I would be forced to read on Friday was just too much. I won't waste my time in criticising the inestimable Mr I this week, I trust Scott's success is a better lesson than any I could give. There was nothing much wrong with Sean's three selections, they all looked likely winners certainly, but were they value? With the possible exception of Fulham I would have to suggest that they were not. There is an old saying in sport - 'form is temporary, class is permanent' - and to an extent we should beware of backing teams in form. This is not so much because they can't be expected to maintain their form, but because their form will be well and truly reflected in the price as bookies know that punters back teams in form and thus keep their prices unnaturally short. The same is true of favourites in general - Mr Murray's performance this week shows the value to be had in backing against the favourite. If there is one piece of advice I would give to Mr Ingle, and indeed to you all, it is to stop looking for winners and start looking for value. Danny Last of the Football Unlimited punter's collective \u00a310 treble: Wimbledon to beat Wolves @ 4/6, Brighton to beat Cheltenham @ 4/5, Livingston to beat Raith @ 8/15. Three picks all odds-on and only one winner. Alas Mr Last has been taking the advice of monkeys in leotards. Value not winners, it's the theme of the week. It's easy to make a case for most odds-on shots, and Mr Last makes a convincing case for all three, but football's a funny game and the 8/15 shots do get tonked 4-0 at home every now and again. I'll say it again, dear punter, stop looking for winners and start looking for value.

Palpitating stuff - but not the real thing, nothing to match trouble on the forecourt or (eureka!) a Tory lead at the polls. Pause, though, for the memoir mills have not fallen silent. They still grind on, a vital commentary on current debacle.</p> <p>Andrew Rawnsley is a tried and tested name to Guardian and Observer readers. He's a serious journalist with serious sources. When he writes about Gordon sitting in a minibus listening to one of Tony's big speeches on the radio and heckling away (\"The New Deal is up and running.\" Grunt. \"He didn't want that.\") he oozes credibility. The relationship between PM and chancellor may be more complex than any single book can chart; that's the way with stormy marriages of mind and ambition. But you don't need to see the whole truth to see enough of the truth. This is a partnership which may, originally, have constructed the electoral phenomenon called New Labour. Now it's a liability.</p> <p>We know - from the pages of Rawnsley - who stitched up who over Europe, who sacked whose mates, who fiddled while Mandelson burned, and danced around the bonfire. We know about love and hate. What we don't know (exactly) is who briefed and counter-briefed Andrew so commodiously - and why. Nor, perhaps more pressingly, do we quite know what our heroes are saying about each other in private this morning.</p> <p>\"Someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the prime minister\", you may recall, once caused a bit of a stink when he talked to Rawnsley about Mr Brown's \"psychological flaws\". But do you remember what that someone went on to say? \"If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid they all have a single thread to them: they are coming out of the Treasury.\" An old list in need of updating. Add 75p pension rises. Add the price of petrol at the pumps - in neon lights.</p> <p>Mr Blair has endured a wretched few days, caught short at a Chinese supper in Humberside all unawares of the tumult around him. Did he make a good fist of the crisis? Not according to some astronomically awful opinion poll verdicts. The first 48 hours of the fire were more flailing than fighting. Stephen Byers and John Reid were fed to the flames bearing notably blue touchpaper and notably duff arguments. But in the end the prime minister found his bearings and dug in on a principle which needed to be sustained. In the end he showed the resolve of leadership, gambling and battling through.</p> <p>Where, though, was the man who would be leader through this travail? The chancellor didn't exactly put himself about, merely reiterating the impossibility of disturbing the sanctity of the Budget process a couple of times. When the going got tough, he didn't get going. Blair ran cover for Brown. What would \"someone with an extremely good claim\" make of that?</p> <p>In a well-ordered world, of course, there would be no cause for recrimination. Policies - including petrol pricing - would have been exhaustively debated around the cabinet table, sealed by collective responsibility. But is that quite the way this chancellor works? Hardly: and the original fallout over the euro is worth invoking here. Mr Blair was anxious not to rule out joining in the first term because that was his political judgment. Mr Brown sought unilaterally to sweep such possibilities from the table because that was his economic judgment. Politics: economics. Thus the cake of governance is carved between the two master chefs. Yet it's a totally unreal division.</p> <p>The 75p pension rise was economics to a set formula. Low inflation equals a few coins in your pocket. Don't load on extra largesse because we're trying - perfectly sentiently - to lower dependence on the state pension anyway. But politically it was utterly crass, achieving the precise reverse of sentient policy.</p> <p>And if that's true for pensions, consider the still more awful debacle of the fuel escalator. The chancellor apparently addressed that in his last Budget when he suspended the escalator. Oh no he didn't! Many things - including Opec meetings - happen between Budgets. And they have instant political impact, demanding instant thought. If the ultimate case is green, it has to be made. If it doesn't stick, it has to be made again and again. Politics and economics don't come in separate boxes. They're inextricably mixed.</p> <p>Here, beyond personalities, is the fundamental point needing fundamental action. Briefing ministers were out and about yesterday, dumping on Gordon (who has no great gift for making friends and influencing people). If there's an immediate scapegoat for this shambles, his name is Brown - and there'll doubtless be a deal of pressure on Mr Blair to exact the penalties of blame. Pressure that a weakened prime minister will have to resist, of course. More flailing in the marsh.</p> <p>But the real problem goes deeper than petty jealousies and old scores repaid. It is structural - in the division of the 1997 spoils and the spheres of influence. Chancellors of the exchequer are very important chaps, but they aren't islands unto themselves. They have to be part of the team, the political team. They have to share and consult and bear joint responsibility - to keep their minds, in short, on all of the job. When, structurally, that isn't the case, then disaster follows automatically.</p> <p>Time to take stock. The febrile polls will blow away. William Hague isn't the tiger in anyone's tank. You'd still bet on continuing Labour government (though not, maybe, on a spring election). But one political thing, I think, has changed for good. Gordon Brown will not - in his dreams or in reality - succeed Tony Blair in some genteel pass-the-parcel of power. The aura of invincibility has dropped from him. Look elsewhere for Labour's next leader. The central alliance is bust.</p> <p>That, surely, must prove a blessing in disguise. There's no more crucial relationship in government than the one between No 10 and No 11. When it fractures -see Lawson and Mrs T - everything falls apart. Even if the petrol gaffe hadn't happened, the euro referendum was geared for inevitable desuetude.</p> <p>Only Blair - the politician - can repair Labour's damaged fortunes.

      "bodyText": "A week ago, before the week that was, we were swilling in surrogate memoirs. Tony's troubles with Gordon: Mo's troubles with Tony: Gordon's troubles with everyone. Palpitating stuff - but not the real thing, nothing to match trouble on the forecourt or (eureka!) a Tory lead at the polls. Pause, though, for the memoir mills have not fallen silent. They still grind on, a vital commentary on current debacle. Andrew Rawnsley is a tried and tested name to Guardian and Observer readers. He's a serious journalist with serious sources. When he writes about Gordon sitting in a minibus listening to one of Tony's big speeches on the radio and heckling away (\"The New Deal is up and running.\" Grunt. \"He didn't want that.\") he oozes credibility. The relationship between PM and chancellor may be more complex than any single book can chart; that's the way with stormy marriages of mind and ambition. But you don't need to see the whole truth to see enough of the truth. This is a partnership which may, originally, have constructed the electoral phenomenon called New Labour. Now it's a liability. We know - from the pages of Rawnsley - who stitched up who over Europe, who sacked whose mates, who fiddled while Mandelson burned, and danced around the bonfire. We know about love and hate. What we don't know (exactly) is who briefed and counter-briefed Andrew so commodiously - and why. Nor, perhaps more pressingly, do we quite know what our heroes are saying about each other in private this morning. \"Someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the prime minister\", you may recall, once caused a bit of a stink when he talked to Rawnsley about Mr Brown's \"psychological flaws\". But do you remember what that someone went on to say? \"If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid they all have a single thread to them: they are coming out of the Treasury.\" An old list in need of updating. Add 75p pension rises. Add the price of petrol at the pumps - in neon lights. Mr Blair has endured a wretched few days, caught short at a Chinese supper in Humberside all unawares of the tumult around him. Did he make a good fist of the crisis? Not according to some astronomically awful opinion poll verdicts. The first 48 hours of the fire were more flailing than fighting. Stephen Byers and John Reid were fed to the flames bearing notably blue touchpaper and notably duff arguments. But in the end the prime minister found his bearings and dug in on a principle which needed to be sustained. In the end he showed the resolve of leadership, gambling and battling through. Where, though, was the man who would be leader through this travail? The chancellor didn't exactly put himself about, merely reiterating the impossibility of disturbing the sanctity of the Budget process a couple of times. When the going got tough, he didn't get going. Blair ran cover for Brown. What would \"someone with an extremely good claim\" make of that? In a well-ordered world, of course, there would be no cause for recrimination. Policies - including petrol pricing - would have been exhaustively debated around the cabinet table, sealed by collective responsibility. But is that quite the way this chancellor works? Hardly: and the original fallout over the euro is worth invoking here. Mr Blair was anxious not to rule out joining in the first term because that was his political judgment. Mr Brown sought unilaterally to sweep such possibilities from the table because that was his economic judgment. Politics: economics. Thus the cake of governance is carved between the two master chefs. Yet it's a totally unreal division. The 75p pension rise was economics to a set formula. Low inflation equals a few coins in your pocket. Don't load on extra largesse because we're trying - perfectly sentiently - to lower dependence on the state pension anyway. But politically it was utterly crass, achieving the precise reverse of sentient policy. And if that's true for pensions, consider the still more awful debacle of the fuel escalator. The chancellor apparently addressed that in his last Budget when he suspended the escalator. Oh no he didn't! Many things - including Opec meetings - happen between Budgets. And they have instant political impact, demanding instant thought. If the ultimate case is green, it has to be made. If it doesn't stick, it has to be made again and again. Politics and economics don't come in separate boxes. They're inextricably mixed. Here, beyond personalities, is the fundamental point needing fundamental action. Briefing ministers were out and about yesterday, dumping on Gordon (who has no great gift for making friends and influencing people). If there's an immediate scapegoat for this shambles, his name is Brown - and there'll doubtless be a deal of pressure on Mr Blair to exact the penalties of blame. Pressure that a weakened prime minister will have to resist, of course. More flailing in the marsh. But the real problem goes deeper than petty jealousies and old scores repaid. It is structural - in the division of the 1997 spoils and the spheres of influence. Chancellors of the exchequer are very important chaps, but they aren't islands unto themselves. They have to be part of the team, the political team. They have to share and consult and bear joint responsibility - to keep their minds, in short, on all of the job. When, structurally, that isn't the case, then disaster follows automatically. Time to take stock. The febrile polls will blow away. William Hague isn't the tiger in anyone's tank. You'd still bet on continuing Labour government (though not, maybe, on a spring election). But one political thing, I think, has changed for good. Gordon Brown will not - in his dreams or in reality - succeed Tony Blair in some genteel pass-the-parcel of power. The aura of invincibility has dropped from him. Look elsewhere for Labour's next leader. The central alliance is bust. That, surely, must prove a blessing in disguise. There's no more crucial relationship in government than the one between No 10 and No 11. When it fractures -see Lawson and Mrs T - everything falls apart. Even if the petrol gaffe hadn't happened, the euro referendum was geared for inevitable desuetude. Only Blair - the politician - can repair Labour's damaged fortunes. Everything hangs on him, because there is no alternative. Mr Brown can help for a while en poste, then survive in due course by moving on to the foreign office or some more peripheral role. Structure matters. It has been the rot inside New Labour thus far. The lesson of the longest week is that it has to be got right now - or else. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Loyalist paramilitary drug dealers have been blamed for a bomb attack which left a man badly injured in Northern Ireland today. Sandy Rice fell from his van bleeding heavily with serious leg wounds when a device exploded under the seat as he drove through the seaside town of Bangor, Co Down. Two other men who were with him escaped the blast, just hours after a bomb wrecked Shankill Road offices shared by the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), the political wing of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) as part of the escalating loyalist feud in Belfast. Component parts for pipe bombs, the tail fin of a mortar bomb, balaclavas and combat clothing were later found in the debris, police revealed. But it is not thought the Bangor blast is linked to fighting between the UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) which has left three men dead and scores of families having to flee their homes. Mr Rice was head of security at a nightclub in Bangor, and had been threatened by drugs dealers linked to the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), according to David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), a member of the Northern Ireland assembly. The LVF, a splinter group heavily involved in drugs trafficking, is backing the UDA in the feud, and even though this attack is not being linked to the fighting, it is bound to heighten the tensions between the rival factions. Mr Ervine, a close friend of Mr Rice, a former loyalist internee who spent nearly 20 years living near London before returning home to set up an electrical business and run a boxing club, said: \"This man was under serious threat of losing his life because of his stand against the drugs dealers.

Mrs Milliken said: \"The driver seemed to fall out of the van. He was badly injured, but the other two looked to be okay. People in the crowd gave him first aid until the ambulance arrived.\" Mr Milliken added: \"There was this loud bang and suddenly a big cloud of smoke.\" Hours earlier, an explosion destroyed a building in the Shankill Road used by the Prisoners Aid and Post-Conflict Re-settlement group and where the UDP also has offices. Nobody was hurt in the attack thought to have been carried out by the UVF. UDP leader John White claimed the UVF leadership had lost control of its members. He said: \"The only way this will come to an end is for the UVF leadership to take control of their organisation and control the thugs and bully boys who are running about intimidating women and children, burning people out of their homes and blowing buildings up.\" The same building attacked overnight was targeted by gunmen soon after the UVF shot dead two men in the nearby Crumlin Road early in the feud last month. That attack provoked an immediate response with the burning of the Progressive Unionist party office a couple of hundred yards down the road.",

Stealth advertising is about promoting the values or lifestyle or attitude of the product rather than the product itself. </p> <p>Morven Sloane, senior product manager at Sony Computer Entertainment, who has been masterminding the PlayStation2 stealth launch, endorses this. \"We thought our audience was getting jaded with brands and bog standard advertising - we wanted to do something more challenging that would drive our image as an edgy, alternative games provider.

Elsewhere, however, sales are thought to have been slower. As widely rumoured, chief executive Peter Salsbury, who took the helm just under two years ago after a brutal boardroom rift is expected to leave the group to clear the way for the appointment of Roger Holmes, a director of Kingfisher, the Woolworths and B&amp;Q chain. The animosity between Kingfisher and M&amp;S, which recently poached Alan McWalter as its first marketing director from the group, means that Mr Holmes will be unable to take up an active role at M&amp;S before the crucial Christmas trading period. Amid upheaval of the senior management at a number of rival retailers, M&amp;S veteran Mr Salsbury is expected to shoulder the blame for another difficult six months of trading. New chairman Luc Vandevelde, who has pledged to raise sales, may risk flouting corporate governance codes by taking on some of the roles of his chief executive whom he has repeatedly denied he was seeking to replace. Mr Holmes, who has told Kingfisher of his intention to leave but has yet to resign officially, is expected to be named as head of UK retail and then be groomed as chief executive. Mr Vandevelde, recruited earlier this year with a \u00a32m golden hello, will also use today's stock market announcement to make other appointments to bolster his board which he has said needs more executives with particular retail experience.

      "body": "<p>\"How many Argentines were there on the islands in 1982?\" </p> <p>\"Too many.\" </p> <p>\"How many?\" </p> <p>\"One.\" </p> <p> This is what passes for a joke on the Falkland Islands, as told by a friendly taxi driver to Argentine tourist Fabian Stratas, the protagonist of the new film Fuckland. The camera shows him smiling understandingly while, in a voiceover, he suggests the taxi driver should \"go and fuck himself\". The effect is comic, not acerbic. </p> <p>Filmed in just one week last December, two months after Argentines were again permitted to fly to the place they call the Malvinas, Fuckland is Jose Luis Marques's first feature. He and his crew of six walked off a plane at the islands' military airport and shot 80 hours of footage disguised as tourists. The camera was left on tables or bars, apparently switched off, while Stratas interacted with islanders. Now there are posters all over Buenos Aires promoting Marques's clandestine film. The islands' authorities are outraged: the governor general says he would have prevented filming if he had known about it, and the movie will not be shown in the Falklands' only cinema. </p> <p>Fuckland's plot is simple: since Argentina can't get the islands back by force or persuasion - as tried by ex-President Menem's foreign minister Guido di Tella - Stratas has gone to inseminate the local females with Argentine genes. In a rare attempt at humour, the Economist once suggested sending Argentine women to the islands to out-breed the locals; Marques sees his film as more Argentine, a study of penetrative conquest. \"The film is about the Argentine desire to make conquests with no sense of morality,\" he says. </p> <p>Throughout their continent, Argentines are viewed as the most arrogant of Latin Americans. The criticism is familiar but, according to Marques, it has never been analysed in depth. \"I've always wanted to make a self-critical film,\" he says. \"Fabian's mission is the lowest possible. He's a typical Argentine abroad, the kind that makes you feel ashamed. But he's not just a smartarse on holiday. He's immoral.\" </p> <p>Stratas, a magician by trade who previously had small parts in Sally Potter's The Tango Lesson and Alan Parker's Evita, describes the character he plays as \"arrogant, overbearing, rude\". The fact that he's filming people makes this doubly true. \"This is The Truman Show backwards,\" he says. \"I know everything, they know nothing.\" </p> <p>But for Stratas, aesthetics come into it, too. \"We live in a world in which people are begging to cross the line of fiction - in Big Brother, reality shows. Even in a so-called documentary, we're playing with lights, music, emotions - it's a fiction.

      "bodyText": "\"How many Argentines were there on the islands in 1982?\" \"Too many.\" \"How many?\" \"One.\" This is what passes for a joke on the Falkland Islands, as told by a friendly taxi driver to Argentine tourist Fabian Stratas, the protagonist of the new film Fuckland. The camera shows him smiling understandingly while, in a voiceover, he suggests the taxi driver should \"go and fuck himself\". The effect is comic, not acerbic. Filmed in just one week last December, two months after Argentines were again permitted to fly to the place they call the Malvinas, Fuckland is Jose Luis Marques's first feature. He and his crew of six walked off a plane at the islands' military airport and shot 80 hours of footage disguised as tourists. The camera was left on tables or bars, apparently switched off, while Stratas interacted with islanders. Now there are posters all over Buenos Aires promoting Marques's clandestine film. The islands' authorities are outraged: the governor general says he would have prevented filming if he had known about it, and the movie will not be shown in the Falklands' only cinema. Fuckland's plot is simple: since Argentina can't get the islands back by force or persuasion - as tried by ex-President Menem's foreign minister Guido di Tella - Stratas has gone to inseminate the local females with Argentine genes. In a rare attempt at humour, the Economist once suggested sending Argentine women to the islands to out-breed the locals; Marques sees his film as more Argentine, a study of penetrative conquest. \"The film is about the Argentine desire to make conquests with no sense of morality,\" he says. Throughout their continent, Argentines are viewed as the most arrogant of Latin Americans. The criticism is familiar but, according to Marques, it has never been analysed in depth. \"I've always wanted to make a self-critical film,\" he says. \"Fabian's mission is the lowest possible. He's a typical Argentine abroad, the kind that makes you feel ashamed. But he's not just a smartarse on holiday. He's immoral.\" Stratas, a magician by trade who previously had small parts in Sally Potter's The Tango Lesson and Alan Parker's Evita, describes the character he plays as \"arrogant, overbearing, rude\". The fact that he's filming people makes this doubly true. \"This is The Truman Show backwards,\" he says. \"I know everything, they know nothing.\" But for Stratas, aesthetics come into it, too. \"We live in a world in which people are begging to cross the line of fiction - in Big Brother, reality shows. Even in a so-called documentary, we're playing with lights, music, emotions - it's a fiction. I made the film to explore the line where fiction begins.\" He is a fan of the Dogme 95 movement - the ultra-realist Danish film group based around Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg - which has given its eighth certificate to Fuckland. The Fuckland team play down the political dimensions of the film. Marques argues that \"the islands served to strengthen the metaphor of macho man in search of conquest\". At the same time, there was a sense of tension on the islands: the film records a local radio channel apologising because there might be Argentines at the Remembrance Day service. \"If we had known there were so many people,\" the organisers say, \"we would have made reservations for the British.\" Other similar details - signs telling Argentines to give up their sovereignty claim, the cold military reception the film-makers got at airport - make the Falkland Islanders appear xenophobic and unfriendly. Marques and Stratas were both surprised by the stuffiness of the place, the lack of youth culture. \"The people who have power are very conservative and they tell others what they can watch and what they can't,\" says Stratas. \"There's no cinema outside the military base. These people love their position. They just talk about sovereignty because it's the only thing they've got in common and they're isolated . They don't want to solve the big issue, because if that's solved, what have they got left?\" In the film, the islands' pubs and old-fashioned restaurants seem sad places where bored locals and soldiers go for heavy boozing sessions or formal meals. \"Imagine being 21 and seeing the same people every day,\" says Stratas. \"There's nothing to do but get wasted.\" The only other actor, Camilla Heaney, is British.

      "body": "<p>First, some context. I own a 1983 Mercedes 280TE estate. Something of a classic, I was told by the man who sold me it. It's big and heavy, and if you want to go round a corner, it's best to plan ahead. It has a turning circle like the Titanic's. If you want to stop, it's best to have sent a stamped, addressed envelope several days before. It is, as the man said, a beautiful old boat, and it will comfortably sit at 95mph while three people have a fight in the back about which CD you're going to pull from the capacious glovebox. So when I slid into the bucketed seats of Alfa Romeo's new sports estate and breathed in brand new car, it was something of a culture shock. </p> <p>It's an attractive estate - more attractive than Alfa's 156 saloon on which it is based. It has the same creases across the sharp bonnet, a small spoiler built into the roof above the tailgate, the number plate daintily set to the side. Inside, it is on the compact side: many years of attention to car safety have compressed the interiors of cars so there are not the vast open spaces that exist in my Mercedes aircraft hanger. (This is the first Fiat Auto model to have a six-airbag option, I'm told - two front, two side and an optional two along the windows.) But it is not as small as it feels. I managed to fit a bicycle in the back without scratching too much of the paintwork. </p> <p>The drive is sporty. The first corner, at a lowish speed in town, was a dreamy experience in which the Sportwagon just seemed to want to go faster. And it stops very sharply and smoothly indeed. </p> <p>There's lots of nice detail inside the car too. The driving seat pumps up and down, and the steering wheel too. Airbags all round. The interior is made of the inoffensive grey plastic that every new car seems to have; the gauges are minimalist, classy, Italian. \"The luggage floor,\" say Alfa, \"is dual-sided and when turned over acts as a waterproof tray for storing ski boots or wet swimming costumes.\" </p> <p>The doorknobs for the back are hidden in the window frames, which makes them invisible and allows a small moment of pleasure when back seat passengers are trying to work out how to get in. And there's a button that switches a digital read-out between odometer and outside air temperature, which seems entirely unnecessary but, hey, once you have it it seems really important to know exactly how many degrees C it is out there. </p> <p>But the best bit is the little whistling noise.

      "bodyText": "First, some context. I own a 1983 Mercedes 280TE estate. Something of a classic, I was told by the man who sold me it. It's big and heavy, and if you want to go round a corner, it's best to plan ahead. It has a turning circle like the Titanic's. If you want to stop, it's best to have sent a stamped, addressed envelope several days before. It is, as the man said, a beautiful old boat, and it will comfortably sit at 95mph while three people have a fight in the back about which CD you're going to pull from the capacious glovebox. So when I slid into the bucketed seats of Alfa Romeo's new sports estate and breathed in brand new car, it was something of a culture shock. It's an attractive estate - more attractive than Alfa's 156 saloon on which it is based. It has the same creases across the sharp bonnet, a small spoiler built into the roof above the tailgate, the number plate daintily set to the side. Inside, it is on the compact side: many years of attention to car safety have compressed the interiors of cars so there are not the vast open spaces that exist in my Mercedes aircraft hanger. (This is the first Fiat Auto model to have a six-airbag option, I'm told - two front, two side and an optional two along the windows.) But it is not as small as it feels. I managed to fit a bicycle in the back without scratching too much of the paintwork. The drive is sporty. The first corner, at a lowish speed in town, was a dreamy experience in which the Sportwagon just seemed to want to go faster. And it stops very sharply and smoothly indeed. There's lots of nice detail inside the car too. The driving seat pumps up and down, and the steering wheel too. Airbags all round. The interior is made of the inoffensive grey plastic that every new car seems to have; the gauges are minimalist, classy, Italian. \"The luggage floor,\" say Alfa, \"is dual-sided and when turned over acts as a waterproof tray for storing ski boots or wet swimming costumes.\" The doorknobs for the back are hidden in the window frames, which makes them invisible and allows a small moment of pleasure when back seat passengers are trying to work out how to get in. And there's a button that switches a digital read-out between odometer and outside air temperature, which seems entirely unnecessary but, hey, once you have it it seems really important to know exactly how many degrees C it is out there. But the best bit is the little whistling noise. For several days, I thought I could hear police sirens in the distance. And then I realised what it was. You might not remember the scene in Mad Max where the young Aussie policeman is shown his new toy (a V8 Ford Falcon with very large super-charger). The police chief, I seem to recall, asks the mechanic to \"Tell him about the blower!\" And that, in a sad little way, describes the adolescent joy of having a car with a turbo-charger that kicks in and whistles at you while it's doing it. The criticisms are not really mine. One friend who borrowed it said the diesel engine was noisy in traffic jams. And we both managed to ground it easily on speed bumps, which meant taking them a little gingerly. Another friend said that Alfas drive \"light\" - at high speeds with a full load on a bouncy motorway they are less stable. When weighed down with a full number of passengers it was certainly harder to handle. Alfa says it can optionally be fitted with a \"sophisticated Boge-Nivomat self-levelling hydropneumatic rear suspension system\", which adjusts the suspension to the load, apparently.

But this rose to 9.9m when the winner was announced at 11.15pm, giving Channel 4 a huge 56% share of the viewing.</p> <p>BBC1 and ITV both fell victim to Big Brother's success, with ITV's big Friday night film, Twister, attracting a disappointing 5.8m viewers. BBC1 scarcely managed to take 25% of the viewing on Friday evening, with even the ever-popular Parkinson peaking at 5.7m viewers (25%).</p> <p>The end of Big Brother and the 3.4m inherited viewers who stayed with Channel 4 after the end of the show to watch South Park hit BBC1's Olympic coverage. Olympic Grandstand averaged just 2.6m viewers, giving it a 25% share, although it reached a peak of 3.5m at 11.45pm, as Big Brother ended.</p> <p>The BBC's late-night Olympic coverage continued to suffer on Saturday and Sunday from scheduling difficulties due to the time difference with Sydney. But its daytime repeats proved much more popular. The opening ceremony, broadcast on BBC1 Friday morning, attracted a healthy 3.2m viewers to give the channel a 53% share. BBC1 broadcast Olympic Grandstand all day, averaging 2.6m viewers to give it a 34% share.</p> <p>The success of the Saturday night schedules was BBC1's relaunched Casualty. The first in a new series of the long-running hospital drama attracted 9m viewers, giving the channel a 40% share. And 7.8m viewers stuck with BBC1 for Night of 1,000 Shows, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of BBC Television Centre presented by Michael Parkinson.</p> <p>The appeal of Big Brother was finally waning by Saturday night, when Channel 4 broadcast a final all-night special dedicated to the show. Inside Big Brother attracted 2.8m viewers to give the channel a 13% share, still well up on what it would normally get on a Saturday evening.</p> <p>Sunday saw the return of BBC1's Castaway to the schedules. Whether it was due to Big Brother fatigue or a failure to retain enthusiasm after a break from the airwaves, the show made a disappointing debut, attracting 5.6m viewers to give it a 23% share. ITV was Sunday's star performer, kicking off the evening with 8.4m viewers for the ever-popular Kids Say the Funniest Things at 7pm and racking up an impressive 13.5m for Who Wants to be a Millionaire? at 8pm. ITV retained its lead later in the evening with a new crime thriller, My Fragile Heart, which attracted 9.4m viewers to give it a 41% share.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Craig's Big Brother victory gave Channel 4 its highest ever Friday night ratings last week, when nearly 10m viewers tuned in to watch the loveable scouser collect his \u00a370,000. The show attracted 7.5m for its 8.30pm start, giving it a 31% share. But this rose to 9.9m when the winner was announced at 11.15pm, giving Channel 4 a huge 56% share of the viewing. BBC1 and ITV both fell victim to Big Brother's success, with ITV's big Friday night film, Twister, attracting a disappointing 5.8m viewers. BBC1 scarcely managed to take 25% of the viewing on Friday evening, with even the ever-popular Parkinson peaking at 5.7m viewers (25%). The end of Big Brother and the 3.4m inherited viewers who stayed with Channel 4 after the end of the show to watch South Park hit BBC1's Olympic coverage. Olympic Grandstand averaged just 2.6m viewers, giving it a 25% share, although it reached a peak of 3.5m at 11.45pm, as Big Brother ended. The BBC's late-night Olympic coverage continued to suffer on Saturday and Sunday from scheduling difficulties due to the time difference with Sydney. But its daytime repeats proved much more popular. The opening ceremony, broadcast on BBC1 Friday morning, attracted a healthy 3.2m viewers to give the channel a 53% share. BBC1 broadcast Olympic Grandstand all day, averaging 2.6m viewers to give it a 34% share. The success of the Saturday night schedules was BBC1's relaunched Casualty. The first in a new series of the long-running hospital drama attracted 9m viewers, giving the channel a 40% share. And 7.8m viewers stuck with BBC1 for Night of 1,000 Shows, a celebration of the 40th anniversary of BBC Television Centre presented by Michael Parkinson. The appeal of Big Brother was finally waning by Saturday night, when Channel 4 broadcast a final all-night special dedicated to the show. Inside Big Brother attracted 2.8m viewers to give the channel a 13% share, still well up on what it would normally get on a Saturday evening. Sunday saw the return of BBC1's Castaway to the schedules. Whether it was due to Big Brother fatigue or a failure to retain enthusiasm after a break from the airwaves, the show made a disappointing debut, attracting 5.6m viewers to give it a 23% share. ITV was Sunday's star performer, kicking off the evening with 8.4m viewers for the ever-popular Kids Say the Funniest Things at 7pm and racking up an impressive 13.5m for Who Wants to be a Millionaire? at 8pm. ITV retained its lead later in the evening with a new crime thriller, My Fragile Heart, which attracted 9.4m viewers to give it a 41% share.",

      "body": "<p>\"The sentence pronounced this day is of a nature to finally make him see sense,\" opined the president of the court. So now you know, Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9: a little principled and good-natured vandalism at a McDonald's restaurant that's not even built yet constitutes a most heinous crime in France.</p> <p>So heinous, in fact, that it carries a penalty of three months in the slammer. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr Down-with-globalisation, up-with-peasants'-rights Bov\u00e9. If you think you can get away with taking a swing at Ronald McDonald in the birthplace of human rights, you've got another think coming.</p> <p>The verdict handed down in Millau last week, against the jovial, moustached sheep farmer from the Larzac plateau whose colourful campaign against la malbouffe - crap food - has turned him into France's unlikeliest folk hero and a worldwide figurehead for the anti-globalisation movement, was so outrageous that even the magistrates complained about it.</p> <p>\"It is disproportionate in regard both to the reality of the crime, which was wholly non-violent, and to the context of this collective and popular protest,\" their union said in an unusual joint statement with the French barristers' association. \"It is absurd, it is scandalous, and we denounce it wholeheartedly.\"</p> <p>The workings of French justice are indeed strange. This month, in case you had forgotten, also saw very large parts of the country brought to a complete standstill by a blockade that was in flagrant contravention of half a dozen articles in the criminal and civil codes.</p> <p>Hundreds of British tourists were stranded outside the mouth of the Channel tunnel behind barricades that broke EU law. Airports ran out of fuel and domestic flights were diverted to unheard-of bits of Germany and Switzerland where no self-respecting Frenchmen would ever willingly show his face.</p> <p>And did the police intervene? They did not. Will there be a single court case? Of course not. Bov\u00e9's mistake was to have protested on too small a scale and not to have made enough third parties suffer. Had he paralysed France and trashed a few ministers' offices into the bargain, he would almost certainly have got off with a \u00a320 fine.</p> <p>But rather than do things properly, last summer, in the company of nine fellow members of his Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, Bov\u00e9 unscrewed a few window frames, pulled down a few uprights, and daubed a few slogans at a half-built McDonald's outside the small southwestern town of Millau.</p> <p>The stunt was a symbolic protest at sky-high American import duties on treasured rural French delicacies like Dijon mustard, foie gras and Roquefort cheese, which Bov\u00e9 produces when he's not busy being a media darling. McDonald's was the well-chosen target because it stands for the three things Bov\u00e9 and his movement say are ruining small farmers everywhere: unfair American trade tactics; industrially produced, nutrition-free food; and the homogenising, globalising might of the multinationals.</p> <p>Looking back, the whole affair was bathed in the atmosphere of a country fair. The police, forewarned, stood by and smiled. The media, forearmed, were there in force and applauded. A crowd of locals laughed and clapped. The genial Mr Bov\u00e9 sucked on his pipe and grinned.</p> <p>When he was arrested and imprisoned a few days later, hundreds of well-wishers from France to Florida paid his \u00a310,500 bail. He was lunched by the prime minister and dined by the president.

      "bodyText": "\"The sentence pronounced this day is of a nature to finally make him see sense,\" opined the president of the court. So now you know, Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9: a little principled and good-natured vandalism at a McDonald's restaurant that's not even built yet constitutes a most heinous crime in France. So heinous, in fact, that it carries a penalty of three months in the slammer. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr Down-with-globalisation, up-with-peasants'-rights Bov\u00e9. If you think you can get away with taking a swing at Ronald McDonald in the birthplace of human rights, you've got another think coming. The verdict handed down in Millau last week, against the jovial, moustached sheep farmer from the Larzac plateau whose colourful campaign against la malbouffe - crap food - has turned him into France's unlikeliest folk hero and a worldwide figurehead for the anti-globalisation movement, was so outrageous that even the magistrates complained about it. \"It is disproportionate in regard both to the reality of the crime, which was wholly non-violent, and to the context of this collective and popular protest,\" their union said in an unusual joint statement with the French barristers' association. \"It is absurd, it is scandalous, and we denounce it wholeheartedly.\" The workings of French justice are indeed strange. This month, in case you had forgotten, also saw very large parts of the country brought to a complete standstill by a blockade that was in flagrant contravention of half a dozen articles in the criminal and civil codes. Hundreds of British tourists were stranded outside the mouth of the Channel tunnel behind barricades that broke EU law. Airports ran out of fuel and domestic flights were diverted to unheard-of bits of Germany and Switzerland where no self-respecting Frenchmen would ever willingly show his face. And did the police intervene? They did not. Will there be a single court case? Of course not. Bov\u00e9's mistake was to have protested on too small a scale and not to have made enough third parties suffer. Had he paralysed France and trashed a few ministers' offices into the bargain, he would almost certainly have got off with a \u00a320 fine. But rather than do things properly, last summer, in the company of nine fellow members of his Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, Bov\u00e9 unscrewed a few window frames, pulled down a few uprights, and daubed a few slogans at a half-built McDonald's outside the small southwestern town of Millau. The stunt was a symbolic protest at sky-high American import duties on treasured rural French delicacies like Dijon mustard, foie gras and Roquefort cheese, which Bov\u00e9 produces when he's not busy being a media darling. McDonald's was the well-chosen target because it stands for the three things Bov\u00e9 and his movement say are ruining small farmers everywhere: unfair American trade tactics; industrially produced, nutrition-free food; and the homogenising, globalising might of the multinationals. Looking back, the whole affair was bathed in the atmosphere of a country fair. The police, forewarned, stood by and smiled. The media, forearmed, were there in force and applauded. A crowd of locals laughed and clapped. The genial Mr Bov\u00e9 sucked on his pipe and grinned. When he was arrested and imprisoned a few days later, hundreds of well-wishers from France to Florida paid his \u00a310,500 bail. He was lunched by the prime minister and dined by the president. At his trial last June, some 15,000 renegade revellers descended on Millau for two days of music, feasting and anti-capitalist fun. This was, in short, a high-profile case involving a hugely popular figure who did nothing very wrong. He has, moreover, a serious point, and the French - in the wake of mad cows and dioxine-tainted chickens - have taken him to their hearts to the extent that even right-wing news magazines such as Marianne proclaim, quite seriously, \"Jos\u00e9 for president\". So what on earth seized the judge? So far the Green party, the Communist party, the CGT trade union federation and three cabinet ministers have expressed their outrage at his verdict. Bov\u00e9 himself has appealed, as have two fellow conspirators who only got suspended sentences but are set on going to prison if he does. \"This was a classic opportunity for French justice to escape the Napoleonic confines, to show that it understands one man cannot be at the same time a friend of the people and an enemy of the law,\" commented a legal expert, Alain Duhamel. \"It didn't. A couple of thousand francs, a symbolic fine for a symbolic crime, would have been right. Three months in prison is sheer shortsighted stupidity.\" Are you all right, Jacques? Is the president unwell? Rumours swirled round Paris last week that the famously bon vivant French head of state may be suffering from some as-yet-undisclosed malady after he returned from his hols even plumper than usual, then appeared to lose his voice during a speech. \"The presidential belly has raised questions about possible cortisone treatment,\" reported the responsible Le Monde, \"and accounts of him frequently losing his voice have led to theories that he may have contracted throat cancer.\" The health of the nation's leader is, of course, a topic of unusual interest in France. Two of Jacques Chirac's predecessors have tried to hide from the French public the fact that they were suffering from terminal illnesses during long periods of their terms at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In 1996, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand died of a prostate cancer that was diagnosed during the first of his two seven-year stints in office, but he somehow managed to conceal that for more than a decade by issuing downright lies through his chief medical officer. And when, some 20 years earlier, Georges Pompidou suddenly started putting on lots of weight, rumours that his plumpness was related to medical treatment were persistently denied until the day he died of lymph node cancer in 1974. Amid claims by another magazine (though quite how it came by the figure is anyone's guess) that he had gained 9lb since last seen in public, Chirac's aides have insisted that he just ate and drank rather more than usual during his controversial three-week holiday at the \u00a32,000-a-night Royal Palm hotel in Mauritius. \"You know what he's like,\" said his daughter and spin doctor, Claude Chirac. \"He does like his food. And he's not getting any younger. Plus he's had this voice problem for ages; it's an emotional thing. But he has been instructed to go on a diet.\" The fact that his closest aides are suddenly citing Chirac's age - he will be 68 in November - as a plausible excuse for his paunch shows, however, just how desperate they are to dispel this particular rumour. Until now the president, whose gourmet tastes are so pronounced that he once sent a state chef on a week-long trip to Italy to learn how to make a favourite dish of calf's liver, has played down his advancing years in the hope that his energetic bonhomie will persuade voters to give him a second term. If he's prepared to stress how old he is, he's clearly fighting fit. \u0095 France is holding a referendum on the 24th of this month to decide whether or not to cut the presidential term from seven years to five. Apart from the fact that this would marginally increase the chances of the ageing Mr Chirac being re-elected, this is very boring news and has been received as such by the majority of the population who show no intention of voting. What's less boring is that 250 of France's mayors, who are responsible for organising the poll, are refusing to play ball unless the government meets their very local demands, which range from stopping the extension of a rubbish dump to changing the route of a projected motorway. \"In our country, you cannot make yourself heard using legal methods,\" said the mayor of Gap, Pierre Bernard-Reymond. He should know what he's talking about: he's a former cabinet minister.",

When Ken Livingstone finally moves into Lord Foster's glass testicle by Tower Bridge, he must not forget to hang up modern London's coat of arms: an inverted telescope crossed with a telephone receiver (or modem).</p> <p>The first of these is a simple symbol of the old, old capital vice of seeing everything beyond the end of the Tube lines as dim and provincial; the second is more significant as an icon of how progress has played us a nasty, centralising trick. The very instruments designed to liberate, to make it irrelevant who worked where, to abolish the office and even, according to the wildest prophets, the city have had the opposite effect.</p> <p>Modern outposts are limited to the strained conventions of telephone or emailspeak - essentially the problem of getting human warmth along a wire. They have none of the advantages of being physically at the centre of things, while forfeiting the past sense of independence which came from being out of instant reach.

      "bodyText": "From today a significant detail appears in the Guardian in north-west England and Yorkshire - the five letters \"north\" on the masthead, where the word Manchester used to be. The change marks the commitment of more resources, staff and serious attention to the paper's old home - the north-west of both its founder, John Edward Taylor, and its greatest editor, CP Scott; and the Yorkshire of Jeremiah Garnett, Taylor's partner and the paper's first publisher and printer. Differences will be modest to start with, but they will have a resonance outside the north; partly because of the prospects for other English regions and partly for the effect on the metropolitan mind. When Ken Livingstone finally moves into Lord Foster's glass testicle by Tower Bridge, he must not forget to hang up modern London's coat of arms: an inverted telescope crossed with a telephone receiver (or modem). The first of these is a simple symbol of the old, old capital vice of seeing everything beyond the end of the Tube lines as dim and provincial; the second is more significant as an icon of how progress has played us a nasty, centralising trick. The very instruments designed to liberate, to make it irrelevant who worked where, to abolish the office and even, according to the wildest prophets, the city have had the opposite effect. Modern outposts are limited to the strained conventions of telephone or emailspeak - essentially the problem of getting human warmth along a wire. They have none of the advantages of being physically at the centre of things, while forfeiting the past sense of independence which came from being out of instant reach. God forbid that such a thing should have happened, but if a feisty London underling of CP Scott had felt he knew the capital better than Mancunians did (for in those days, at least at the Guardian, the balance of power was the other way), he could act accordingly. Wrath would take time, and time would surely change the editor's famously fair mind. Tony Blair has just had a similar, salutary lesson.

      "bodyText": "A baby may have contracted variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) disease from her mother while in the womb, according to doctors who have examined the 11-month-old girl. The child, whose mother died of the debilitating brain disease in May, is brain damaged and suffers from convulsions . Doctors have not identified any clear causal ailment. Only an autopsy can conclusively verify a case of vCJD, but if confirmed it would be the first evidence that the disease can be passed to unborn children through the placenta and will strengthen fears that the disease can be transmitted through blood. Last week researchers at the Institute for Animal Health produced evidence that BSE can be transferred to other species via blood transfusion. Sheep injected with BSE-infected blood developed a variant of the disease. The child's grandmother, who is also her legal guardian, said that doctors treating the child suspect that vCJD prions had been passed to the baby in the womb. \"They don't know if it's gone into incubation. If so it could be years before we finally confirm the disease,\" she said. Doctors say the child is growing at half the normal rate for a girl of her age and has poor sight and stiff limbs. Her appendix has been examined for evidence of vCJD but the tests were inconclusive. The child, who comes from Warwickshire and cannot be named for legal reasons, is being treated at a London hospital. Richard Lacey, a professor of medical microbiology at Leeds University, said he believed it was inevitable that mothers infected with the disease would pass it on to their children. \"The only thing that is uncertain is the scale on which it is happening,\" he said. In 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food confirmed that BSE could be passed from pregnant cows to unborn offspring, and the same has been observed in sheep, rats and mice. The Department of Health moved to allay fears surrounding the case, stressing that vCJD cases are only identifiable postmortem. \"There is no evidence as yet from any where in the world that vCJD can be passed from mother to child,\" said a spokesman. Nineteen people have died from vCJD this year, making it the worst year since the outbreak began in May 1995. Four people died last month and eight people are suspected of having the disease. Seventy-four people in total have died from the disease. Most vCJD victims are presumed to have been infected by cheap cuts of beef or mechanically recovered meat typ ically used in beefburgers before 1989, when parts of the animal thought most hazardous to human health were banned. The government BSE inquiry team is due to report at the end of the month and is expected to criticise government officials and senior ministers for not acting quickly enough to ensure rules were not flouted. The probable link between BSE-infected beef and probable vCJD deaths and cheap cuts of beef was first established in 1996, seven years after the first BSE outbreak. Frances Hall, the secretary of the Human BSE Foundation, whose son Peter died from vCJD in 1996, said the latest development would be of great concern to families of children born to other women who have died of the disease. \"The families have always been frightened about the possibility of it passing to unborn children. There are a number of babies to women who have died but those children are still healthy,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, used the opening day of his party's conference in Bournemouth to outline a four-stage strategy for putting an end to the long-running dispute over fuel taxation. Using the vehicle of what he termed \"an emergency statement\" at the beginning on the week-long conference, Mr Kennedy told delegates that last week's petrol crisis had been \"a defining moment\" for Britain. He went on to call on the government to cap fuel taxes for five years so as not to profit from future increases in fuel prices. He also urged ministers to take on board a Liberal Democrat pledge to: \u0095 Use the VAT windfall from higher-than-expected fuel prices to ease the burden on the travelling public, \u0095 Ensure oil companies recognise their \"social responsibilities\" in respect of pricing and security of supply; if not, to take measures to tax their excess profits and, \u0095 Support rural petrol stations through rate relief for garages in far-flung locations and increased investment in community public transport. Mr Kennedy stressed the activities of the petrol protesters had highlighted deeper concerns that direct action was seen as a better way of getting a message across than conventional party politics. He argued that however well meaning, public policy could not be determined on who \"has the loudest voice or who can bring things to a halt\". He said: \"Sometimes, just sometimes, there are defining moments for a country and just perhaps, Britain came across one of those moments last week\u0085 \"Ours is a stable country, a sensible country and these are not assets lightly to be squandered. \"A sense of sanity and democracy prevailed, but society and policy cannot be based on who has the loudest voice or who can bring things to a halt however just, however well-behaved, however well-meaning those voices are.\" Special report: Charles Kennedy",

      "bodyText": "French film distributors will plunge into bitter conflict later this month over rival subscription schemes offering unlimited access to cinemas. Already more than 100,000 French film fans have subscribed to a card established six months ago by the country's leading multiplex chain which allows cinemagoers to see as many films at UGC cinemas as they want for only 98 francs (\u00a39) a month. Independent cinemas claim that the card represents unfair competition and is driving them out of business. Now, in an attempt to fight back against UGC's box-office success, the Gaumont circuit, the independent MK2 chain, and several small Parisian cinemas have joined forces. On September 27 they will launch their own subscription card, called Le Pass, also costing 98 francs a month, and giving unlimited access to their cinemas in the Ile de France region. Gaumont and the independents took this step after urging the government in vain in March to outlaw the UGC card. Marin Karmitz, head of MK2, said they decided to take joint action after the office of fair trading rejected his call for UGC's card to be banned. The Gaumont chairman, Nicolas Seydoux, added: \"We have had to overcome our reluctance and must take action or risk going the way of the dinosaurs.\" Jean Henochsberg, who runs two art houses in the Latin Quarter of Paris, which will take part in the Le Pass scheme, said his cinemas had suffered a 10% fall in ticket sales since the UGC card was launched. He claimed to have no choice but to fight back. \"I can't pay my bills any more. And the authorities have done nothing to help.\" Path\u00e9, the third French distribution giant after UGC and Gaumont, may also join the Le Pass scheme later this year. UGC currently claims about 40% of Paris box-office takings, Gaumont 30% and MK2 10%. Path\u00e9 is based mainly in the provinces. UGC's subscription scheme has provoked a passionate de bate among film fans on multiplex giant's website. One correspondent wrote: \"Real cinema lovers will count the cost of this card which will kill the little cinemas. They will also kill that which makes cinema an art: its diversity. Where will one be able to see old films then?\" Another complained that there were so many subtitled Hollywood films on at his local UGC multiplex since the subscription card was introduced that he was getting terrible headaches and eye strain. Perhaps UGC might consider more dubbed films or, just maybe, showing more French pictures in their multiplexes, he suggested. Others have praised UGC for tailoring the card to their filmic obsessions, one saying tshe was delighted that she would be able to see the same film dozens of times a month thanks to the UGC card. Melanie, 69, from Lyon, was typical of the scheme's enthusiasts \"Thanks to this wonderful card, I go to the cinema three or four times a week and I've given up my subscription to cable TV,\" she wrote. Opponents of UGC's scheme argue that the multiplex giant is trying to maximise profits by filling its cinemas with blank-eyed philistines all digesting Hollywood blockbuster pap. And the current top 10 films in French cinemas gives some support to this view: only two films (Sade, starring Daniel Auteuil and based on Serge Bramly's novel The Terror of the Bedroom, and Harry, un Ami Qui vous Veut du Bien, a comedy by Dominik Moll) are French. The rest, although they include such accomplished films as the Coen brothers' O Brother where Art Thou? and Stephen Frears' adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel High Fidelity, are American. According to Le Monde, the battle of the subscription cards will be the \"cinematic soap opera of the autumn\". But that spectacle will be of little consolation to the independent cinemas who are unable to join Le Pass. Their profit margins have already been hit by UGC and are likely to suffer even more during the autumn as the price war intensifies.",

      "body": "<p> Two of the most conspicuous newspaper success stories of recent years have built circulation not through titillation but from the sober concern of business news. In the past year, the FT's circulation has gone into overdrive, adding around 73,000 copies to bring its total daily figure to 459,000 - an increase of almost 19%. Sunday Business is 14% higher than a year ago, with summer sales levelling off at 60,000. The company maintains that advertising revenues are rocketing. </p> <p>The impending launch of Business AM in Scotland has generated much debate about the need for another financial paper in a limited market. But the climate could hardly be better. The newspaper's existence is a product of the extraordinary explosion of interest in all things financial that has spawned not only new papers, but online services, TV channels, magazines and beefed-up attention in mainstream media. </p> <p>The Guardian, which traditionally had an ambivalent relationship with the Square Mile, added pages to its financial section last year, while Greg Dyke made business coverage a priority at the BBC. The media's heightened interest in finance reflects the growing awareness that real power is shifting from politicians to big business. What Rupert Murdoch or Wal-Mart are up to can have as profound an effect on our lives as many political decisions. </p> <p>During the BMW/Rover affair, it quickly became clear who was in control despite Westminster handwringing. Newspaper editors have been forced to reassess the traditional view that politics is the priority on the news agenda. </p> <p>The genesis of public involvement in share ownership was the large-scale privatisation of the Thatcher era. In the 90s, that was cemented by the windfalls from demutualising building societies and insurers. According to the department of social security, a third of Britons now own shares. </p> <p>Interest has also been raised by widespread home ownership, providing many with a sizeable lump sum of capital for the first time - another Thatcher legacy. Cash in the bank and a private pension invested in the stock market produces a vested interest in the economy and sharpens your interest in the financial pages. </p> <p>Jeff Randall, editor of Sunday Business, says the creeping changes in attitude set the scene for the launch of the paper two and a half years ago. \"We unearthed a market most people didn't believe existed because they misjudged the massive social shift in Britain towards interest in business and ownership of shares,\" he says. \"Even my minicab driver has shares in BT, Norwich Union and the Woolwich.\" </p> <p>The internet goldrush has brought a younger, sexier type of businessman or woman into the frame - think Martha Lane Fox rather than the middle-aged balding pinstripe of old. John Penman, Business AM editor, and a former political editor of the Scotsman, says: \"At conference at the Scotsman, the business editor used to come in and nobody would understand what he was talking about - it was like a masonic code. But that's not right because business affects everyone. Where TV shows like Working Lunch have got it right is by making the subject accessible. In Sweden, share ownership is up to 65% of the population and they refer to business as the new rock'n'roll.\" </p> <p>Financial information can now be sourced from a seemingly endless stream of online services such as Thestreet.co.uk, Interactive Investor International and Breakingviews.com. The internet is also playing an increasing part as an easy medium for buying or sell ing shares. For many, going into a stockbrokers would be akin to going into a bookies or a sex shop - a little off-putting. The other recent success has been the influx of US business magazines including Forbes Global and Business Week which have been steadily building circulation. Deregulation of the financial services industry has also created a vast advertising base to support new titles whether they are well read or not. </p> <p>If any doubts were left that finance had gone mainstream, they were dashed by the Sun and Mirror which earlier this year staged an extraordinary battle on their front pages attacking each other's City sections. The Mirror's City Slickers played a notable part in encouraging a punt on the stock market and their downfall of investing in their own tips also proved another point: business can provide some ripping yarns.</p>",

Jeff Randall, editor of Sunday Business, says the creeping changes in attitude set the scene for the launch of the paper two and a half years ago. \"We unearthed a market most people didn't believe existed because they misjudged the massive social shift in Britain towards interest in business and ownership of shares,\" he says. \"Even my minicab driver has shares in BT, Norwich Union and the Woolwich.\" The internet goldrush has brought a younger, sexier type of businessman or woman into the frame - think Martha Lane Fox rather than the middle-aged balding pinstripe of old. John Penman, Business AM editor, and a former political editor of the Scotsman, says: \"At conference at the Scotsman, the business editor used to come in and nobody would understand what he was talking about - it was like a masonic code. But that's not right because business affects everyone. Where TV shows like Working Lunch have got it right is by making the subject accessible. In Sweden, share ownership is up to 65% of the population and they refer to business as the new rock'n'roll.\" Financial information can now be sourced from a seemingly endless stream of online services such as Thestreet.co.uk, Interactive Investor International and Breakingviews.com. The internet is also playing an increasing part as an easy medium for buying or sell ing shares. For many, going into a stockbrokers would be akin to going into a bookies or a sex shop - a little off-putting. The other recent success has been the influx of US business magazines including Forbes Global and Business Week which have been steadily building circulation. Deregulation of the financial services industry has also created a vast advertising base to support new titles whether they are well read or not. If any doubts were left that finance had gone mainstream, they were dashed by the Sun and Mirror which earlier this year staged an extraordinary battle on their front pages attacking each other's City sections. The Mirror's City Slickers played a notable part in encouraging a punt on the stock market and their downfall of investing in their own tips also proved another point: business can provide some ripping yarns.",

In layman's terms that means it is aimed at people who do not currently buy newspapers. But Neil perceives Business AM as a direct challenge to the Scotsman. He has launched a huge new business section in a bid to suffocate the Bonnier title at birth. The Herald is also giving more prominence to its business coverage. Neville says they are wasting paper and energy. \"Two-thirds of Scotsman and Herald readers are not interested in business and finance,\" he claims. \"Sixty per cent of our target market do not read an English or Scottish broadsheet. There is a media gap. If you want to reach all A/B readers with newspaper advertising, you can buy space in every English and Scottish title and still only reach 20% of those in Scotland.\" </p> <p>The Bonnier strategy is to provide something those missing readers cannot get. It knows its newspaper will be a second buy for others - it will not even attempt to cover sport - but the Swedish company is confident that its target readers can afford to buy two newspapers and will not hesitate to grab a product which offers them real excellence. </p> <p>The excellence, not the market research, will be the defining issue. Scottish newspapers have many limitations. First, they are locals not nationals. For all the protestations of national status from the Scotsman and the Herald, they are both city-state products. In that sense they are little different from the Aberdeen Press and Journal or the Dundee Courier. </p> <p>More important than the geographically isolated nature of their core circulations is the obvious cheapness of the indigenous titles. The editor of the Scottish edition of the Daily Mail has a larger budget than my predecessor and I individually had at the Scotsman (I have discovered since leaving). Small circulations have driven the Scottish broadsheets to attempt to compete with their London rivals on the basis of editorial spends of less than half. And salary costs do not compensate for the difference; Scottish journalists are now earning close to London salaries. </p> <p>The results, until recently, were newspapers which did well on domestic (Scottish) news, poorly on the rest of the UK, abysmally on features, and which hardly tried on foreign, business, commentary or analysis. The Barclay brothers (owners of the Scotsman) deserve thanks for trying to change that. In the past four years the Scotsman has had editorial investment to allow it to match perhaps 70% of what the London dailies do. Unfortunately the promotion required to deliver a readership commensurate with the investment has only taken effect since the newspaper began shedding quality staff. The Scotsman is now well financed but desperately short of talent. Andrew Neil is a great journalist and an inspired iconoclast. He will never win a prize for personnel management. </p> <p>And the obvious combination of expansion and turmoil at the Scotsman has not gone unnoticed in Glasgow. The Herald has appointed a new editor and deputy. There is already evidence of change and an expectation that more will follow. SMG, owner of the Herald, Scottish Television, Grampian TV and Ginger Media, is a profitable minnow in the ITV world and clearly vulnerable to a bid by Carlton or Granada. In the long term, a takeover looks likely, but SMG's chief executive, Andrew Flanagan, shows no signs of lying down and waiting to be bought. He is good at maximising the return for his shareholders and that means maximising the value of his assets. Flanagan is not about to allow the Herald to be destroyed by the Scotsman. Investment and improvements are happening at the Glasgow title too. </p> <p>That is the problem. As Business AM launches, the existing Scottish qualities are strangling each other. Herald circulation has tumbled in the past decade (from 130,000 to no more than 95,000 today). The Scotsman's assault has inflicted more damage, but at huge cost to the Barclay brothers. They have spent millions, lost two editors in a year, are widely expected to lose a third before Christmas and have shed almost 50% of the Scotsman team since April. </p> <p>Neil describes this as a cathartic disposal of old carthorses. He is always pugnacious - but he is wrong. The people who have left the paper are the very talent that was hired by the Barclays' editorial investment. </p> <p>Where will it end? A theory is gaining currency in Scotland. Business AM will achieve enough to survive because it has the backing to do so and the talent to deliver excellence to a narrowly defined niche market. In doing so it will further nibble at the already fragile circulations of the Herald and the Scotsman. At this point a Scottish champion will emerge to unite the two historic titles and create a powerful and influential Scottish title. </p> <p>The theory is not new. It is the logic of the Scottish market. But there are new factors apart from Business AM.

And Steve Bell in Thursday's Guardian produced the most hostile image of all, depicting a scowling bunch of picketers as \"Fat Blokes United in Disgruntlement\". Identified by the Daily Mail as decent middle-class folk who naturally took the Mail, they here became surly, red-top-reading morons.",

Peter Salmon, the outgoing BBC1 controller, says: \"I'm not bitter at all, I loved every minute of it, if someone offered it to me again, I'd do it again.\" He describes Heggessey as \"very similar to Dyke in temperament, full of energy, a ball of fire.

More than 130,000 people a year complete a listening diary, producing data for over 260 radio stations, making Rajar the largest, most complex media survey outside the US. </p> <p>The first Rajar paper looking at meters was produced for its board in October 1996. Before this, and subsequently, both Rajar and our research contractor, Ipsos-RSL, have continued to monitor meter developments worldwide.

This test covered radio and TV. BBC1 and BBC2 remained in the test, but BBC Radio withdrew because of faulty encoding equipment from Arbitron. The decision to take the encoding equipment out of the broadcast chain was made after complaints from listeners and not before the BBC had switched to back-up equipment, which also appeared faulty. Following the BBC's tests of the equipment, Arbitron has, to its credit, stepped up its quality control. </p> <p>In fact, the Manchester test has supplied useful information. Although the overall listening level is obviously wrong following the BBC's understandable withdrawal, it has been possible to compare metered audience data versus diary data for commercial stations. </p> <p>Looking at the bigger picture, MacKenzie said radio research is \"based on the widely discredited diary system\" and that meters are \"accurate\". There is no evidence (yet) to support the latter point and it has been proved using coincidental research that the diary methodology provides the closest estimate of radio reach and listening hours. Discredited? Hardly. But that is not to say that there won't be a place for new technology. As MacKenzie rightly says, meters can offer many advantages, including near instant data. </p> <p>But before switching from diaries, the radio industry must be sure that meters can identify the correct station ID, can include all stations irrespective of frequency and work in all locations. And the cost must be reasonable: moving to meters now would increase costs by many multiples of the current (\u00a34m per year) research cost. Since the radio industry pays for the research, this could be one reason why MacKenzie shouldn't be \"astounded that the radio industry is not up in arms seeking a change\". </p> <p>Less obvious issues include meter practicality for users. Kelvin mentioned \"an old dear\" filling in a diary. We know \"old dears\" do fill them in, just as young men and mums fill them in - 3,000 every week in fact. It is less certain at this stage if everybody will be prepared to, say, wear a meter. A meter for radio has to be worn because we can't meter the set, as in television. It could be that men are more likely than women to strap on Arbitron's pager-like meter or the Radiocontrol \"watch\", creating sampling problems. Also, we need to be sure how people use the meters: will they activate them the minute they wake? Will they leave them in the bedroom while they have a shower? </p> <p>These are just some of the issues we have been addressing. There are still so many questions that it is no surprise that meter-based radio research has not yet been implemented in any major market.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The petrol crisis crept up on both press and government. What appeared at first to be a little local difficulty well to the north of London suddenly erupted into a nationwide event. But Fleet Street was more alert than Downing Street. Ahead of the pack was the Daily Mail with its prescient front page at the tail end of the French fuel protest: \"When will OUR petrol run dry?\" The Mail's report that weekend referred to the imminent dangers of ignoring the protests. It had said the same during its ill-fated \"Dump the Pump\" campaign, so the government evidently ignored the warning. </p> <p>While prime minister Tony Blair dealt with the dramas in Sierra Leone, the papers were drawn to the perils facing Sierra man. Perhaps the clearest sign of the coming emergency, and the policy line of the rightwing press, was the Sunday Telegraph's headline eight days ago: \"Petrol panic as Labour refuses to act.\" At least that paper recognised the importance of the story: it was the only Sunday title to accord it proper prominence. </p> <p>Most reports the following day forecast that, with 200 petrol stations already dry, there were problems ahead. But there was still a vague sense of uncertainty among editors. Comment was somewhat muted because, surely, oil companies would not fail to get supplies past a raggle-taggle picket of tractors and lorries. The turning point came on Tuesday when the Sun (\"Great petrol revolt 2000\"), Mirror (\"I'm all right Jag\"), Daily Mail (\"Running on empty\") and Daily Telegraph (\"Panic as the pumps run dry\") found common cause. </p> <p>\"It is difficult not to sympathise with the protesters,\" commented the Telegraph, scourge of miners' pickets, castigator of poll tax marchers, detractor of all extra-parliamentary, undemocratic action. Telegraph columnist Janet Daley's viewpoint was also revealing: \"If the chancellor still has to rob you at the petrol pump to finance improvements in education and health, then he is an appallingly bad financial manager. So honk, honk, honk - for as long as it takes.\" Daley has not been noted previously for encouraging militant action by horny-handed men of toil, but she accurately reflected what was to become the majority press reaction. </p> <p>The Mail, while disapproving of \"the civil disobedience now convulsing this country\", urged Blair to try \"conciliation rather than confrontation\". I seem to recall the Mail giving a somewhat different piece of advice to Margaret Thatcher when she was facing out Arthur Scargill's pickets. The Sun, which inches closer week by week to its old Tory beliefs, urged Blair to placate the protesters by cutting the tax on fuel. Its columnist Richard Littlejohn offered unqualified support to the farmers and hauliers, urging more direct action. Hardly surprising, perhaps, but what did we read in a Sun article celebrating \"All-time great British revolts\"? At the end of a list which praised popular uprisings - including Wat Tyler's revolt and Cromwell's rebellion - came the poll tax riots. I don't seem to recall the Sun backing that uprising at the time. </p> <p>The first genuine indication of the depth of newspaper opposition to Blair was illustrated by the Labour-supporting Mirror's front page on Tuesday, showing Blair's car passing a packed garage forecourt, which questioned the wisdom of his refusal to compromise. The Independent was also sniffy about governmental \"woolliness\", urging chancellor Gordon Brown to speak out. But there were exceptions: the Guardian and the Daily Express said Brown must not be coerced. </p> <p>The Times managed to blame everyone: the oil companies for the surge in prices; the \"motley blockade\" of \"sitting pickets\"; and the government's \"risible political response\". In a more balanced assessment, the paper's City editor Patience Wheatcroft argued that Big Oil was allowing the chancellor to take the heat, yet he was \"right to stand firm\". </p> <p>OK, let's turn off the engine for just a moment to conserve the political petrol. Journalists will rightly argue that there is another way to consider press coverage: assessing it as a technical exercise. Which papers presented the most accurate and comprehensive information in the most understandable form? </p> <p>Over the course of the week, the Mail won the battle of quantity, devoting more space to the story than any other paper. The Financial Times offered the least. At times like this it is obvious why the FT will remain a secondary purchase and never supplant its rivals. Some of its articles were excellent (such as Roula Khalaf on the problems of the Middle East's oil-producing nations and Brian Groom's dispassionate account of the plight of farmers and hauliers) but it just didn't provide a proper service to its readers. </p> <p>A qualitative appraisal, which is necessarily subjective, awards high marks to the Independent for its Tuesday front page graphic (so good that it appeared daily thereafter); to the Times for its even-handed reporting; to the Guardian for its clarity and expansive coverage; to the Sun and the Mirror for their visual projection, though the Mirror's graphics were not up to scratch. Without being critical of what did appear, it is impossible to overlook the fact that two papers with stretched resources - the Independent and the Daily Express - obviously struggled to compete. </p> <p>Several papers used allegorical pictures with masterly skill - pumps with stickers, empty petrol stations, a drip at the end of a pump nozzle. In strictly presentational terms, most papers did quite well. But once we look at the content it is impossible to avoid making value judgments about the fairness of reporting, comment and headline-writing, which, of course, have politics at their core. After its initial hiccup, the Independent's leaders were sensible and balanced. Similarly, the Times was notable for its impartiality. Its Thursday leader was typical, asking searching questions about the pusillanimous behaviour of the tanker drivers and their oil company employers while contending that the government should have put Big Oil under greater pressure. </p> <p>Even-handedness was in shorter supply than unleaded petrol among the tabloids. The Daily Mail led the charge on Wednesday with 11 pages on the crisis, but it was Lynda Lee-Potter's column which caught the eye. \"Truck drivers as a race are the old-fashioned kind of British working class,\" she argued. \"They aren't anarchists, troublemakers or fascists\" but \"decent working men who only want a reasonable deal\". The Sun's Littlejohn, even by his vitriolic standards, was vicious on Thursday, but it was the Mirror's Tony Parsons who showed the new mood: \"It took the Tories almost 20 years to become a bunch of smug, self-righteous, out-of-touch morons who turned your stomach... New Labour managed it in more like 20 months.\" The Sun accused ministers of telling \"7 great lies\" in a bid to dodge responsibility.

It also stressed that newspapers were not encouraging the blockades: \"This is a genuine people's protest.\" </p> <p>Genuine in what sense, though? There can be little doubt that many of the people on the picket lines, particularly farmers and some of the hauliers, have suffered hardship due to petrol price rises. Then again, many miners outside the Saltley coke works in 1984 were justifiably aggrieved about their future livelihoods.

      "bodyText": "The petrol crisis crept up on both press and government. What appeared at first to be a little local difficulty well to the north of London suddenly erupted into a nationwide event. But Fleet Street was more alert than Downing Street. Ahead of the pack was the Daily Mail with its prescient front page at the tail end of the French fuel protest: \"When will OUR petrol run dry?\" The Mail's report that weekend referred to the imminent dangers of ignoring the protests. It had said the same during its ill-fated \"Dump the Pump\" campaign, so the government evidently ignored the warning. While prime minister Tony Blair dealt with the dramas in Sierra Leone, the papers were drawn to the perils facing Sierra man. Perhaps the clearest sign of the coming emergency, and the policy line of the rightwing press, was the Sunday Telegraph's headline eight days ago: \"Petrol panic as Labour refuses to act.\" At least that paper recognised the importance of the story: it was the only Sunday title to accord it proper prominence. Most reports the following day forecast that, with 200 petrol stations already dry, there were problems ahead. But there was still a vague sense of uncertainty among editors. Comment was somewhat muted because, surely, oil companies would not fail to get supplies past a raggle-taggle picket of tractors and lorries. The turning point came on Tuesday when the Sun (\"Great petrol revolt 2000\"), Mirror (\"I'm all right Jag\"), Daily Mail (\"Running on empty\") and Daily Telegraph (\"Panic as the pumps run dry\") found common cause. \"It is difficult not to sympathise with the protesters,\" commented the Telegraph, scourge of miners' pickets, castigator of poll tax marchers, detractor of all extra-parliamentary, undemocratic action. Telegraph columnist Janet Daley's viewpoint was also revealing: \"If the chancellor still has to rob you at the petrol pump to finance improvements in education and health, then he is an appallingly bad financial manager. So honk, honk, honk - for as long as it takes.\" Daley has not been noted previously for encouraging militant action by horny-handed men of toil, but she accurately reflected what was to become the majority press reaction. The Mail, while disapproving of \"the civil disobedience now convulsing this country\", urged Blair to try \"conciliation rather than confrontation\". I seem to recall the Mail giving a somewhat different piece of advice to Margaret Thatcher when she was facing out Arthur Scargill's pickets. The Sun, which inches closer week by week to its old Tory beliefs, urged Blair to placate the protesters by cutting the tax on fuel. Its columnist Richard Littlejohn offered unqualified support to the farmers and hauliers, urging more direct action. Hardly surprising, perhaps, but what did we read in a Sun article celebrating \"All-time great British revolts\"? At the end of a list which praised popular uprisings - including Wat Tyler's revolt and Cromwell's rebellion - came the poll tax riots. I don't seem to recall the Sun backing that uprising at the time. The first genuine indication of the depth of newspaper opposition to Blair was illustrated by the Labour-supporting Mirror's front page on Tuesday, showing Blair's car passing a packed garage forecourt, which questioned the wisdom of his refusal to compromise. The Independent was also sniffy about governmental \"woolliness\", urging chancellor Gordon Brown to speak out. But there were exceptions: the Guardian and the Daily Express said Brown must not be coerced. The Times managed to blame everyone: the oil companies for the surge in prices; the \"motley blockade\" of \"sitting pickets\"; and the government's \"risible political response\". In a more balanced assessment, the paper's City editor Patience Wheatcroft argued that Big Oil was allowing the chancellor to take the heat, yet he was \"right to stand firm\". OK, let's turn off the engine for just a moment to conserve the political petrol. Journalists will rightly argue that there is another way to consider press coverage: assessing it as a technical exercise. Which papers presented the most accurate and comprehensive information in the most understandable form? Over the course of the week, the Mail won the battle of quantity, devoting more space to the story than any other paper. The Financial Times offered the least. At times like this it is obvious why the FT will remain a secondary purchase and never supplant its rivals. Some of its articles were excellent (such as Roula Khalaf on the problems of the Middle East's oil-producing nations and Brian Groom's dispassionate account of the plight of farmers and hauliers) but it just didn't provide a proper service to its readers. A qualitative appraisal, which is necessarily subjective, awards high marks to the Independent for its Tuesday front page graphic (so good that it appeared daily thereafter); to the Times for its even-handed reporting; to the Guardian for its clarity and expansive coverage; to the Sun and the Mirror for their visual projection, though the Mirror's graphics were not up to scratch. Without being critical of what did appear, it is impossible to overlook the fact that two papers with stretched resources - the Independent and the Daily Express - obviously struggled to compete. Several papers used allegorical pictures with masterly skill - pumps with stickers, empty petrol stations, a drip at the end of a pump nozzle. In strictly presentational terms, most papers did quite well. But once we look at the content it is impossible to avoid making value judgments about the fairness of reporting, comment and headline-writing, which, of course, have politics at their core. After its initial hiccup, the Independent's leaders were sensible and balanced. Similarly, the Times was notable for its impartiality. Its Thursday leader was typical, asking searching questions about the pusillanimous behaviour of the tanker drivers and their oil company employers while contending that the government should have put Big Oil under greater pressure. Even-handedness was in shorter supply than unleaded petrol among the tabloids. The Daily Mail led the charge on Wednesday with 11 pages on the crisis, but it was Lynda Lee-Potter's column which caught the eye. \"Truck drivers as a race are the old-fashioned kind of British working class,\" she argued. \"They aren't anarchists, troublemakers or fascists\" but \"decent working men who only want a reasonable deal\".

      "body": "<p>After two decades spent living in the public eye, the final act of Paula Yates had no audience. It was a tragic end to what was to the outside world a glamorous, if turbulent, life of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll stars. </p> <p>Since 1982, pretty much everything she did had attracted headlines, often at her own behest. But the media maelstrom around Yates grew so much more intense after a chat in bed with the rock star Michael Hutchence. </p> <p>She had interviewed the Australian frontman of the band INXS for Channel 4's Big Breakfast programme, made by a production company owned by her husband, Bob Geldof. With their legs entwined, the mutual attraction that would consume and destroy her marriage to Geldof was obvious to those watching. </p> <p>Yates became famous as the front woman of the Tube, the groundbreaking Channel 4 music programme. She was hired for the job by Andrea Wonfor, the show's executive producer: \"Everything changed after she met Michael Hutchence. She threw everything away and found nothing left after he died.\" </p> <p>In 1982 Yates, then 22, burst on to television screens. With her blonde hair and low-cut, tight dresses, she came across as a wild child. The reality, says Ms Wonfor, was very different. </p> <p><strong> Restrained</strong><br> </p> <p> Compared to the later stories of drugs and drink, her time at the Tube was relatively restrained as she soon became pregnant with her first child: \"For the whole five years of the Tube, Paula was the bloody boring one. She'd go to bed at 9.30pm, when everyone else was in the bar, and be back up at 6.30am to take Fifi for a swim,\" Ms Wonfor remembers. </p> <p>Yates began dating Geldof, the frontman of the band the Boomtown Rats, in 1977. She was determined to have him and stuck so close to him that other band members called her \"the limpet\". </p> <p>Paula and Bob were one of the most fashionable couples of the 1980s, but their paths to the outside world were diverging. She, to some, appeared narcissistic and shallow, happy only in the world of celebrity and rock stars. He went off to fight famine in Africa and became \"Saint Bob\" after masterminding Band Aid. </p> <p>Their marriage was dogged by persistent rumours of Geldof's infidelity and from their public utterances Geldof and Yates had different expectations about their relationship, and about the role of passion. \"To live your life in a state of passion would be tedious because everything is distorted. It is extremely dull and limiting. Sexual passion burns out,\" Geldof once said. </p> <p>Seven months before she left Geldof, Yates told an interviewer she thought of herself as a \"steaming Jezebel given half an opportunity. Why can't I be? Why can I only be this great lactating person?\". </p> <p>Asked if she was storing up an emotional time bomb, she replied: \"It probably is, and I say to Bob it will be terrible. It will be like the Exorcist.\" </p> <p>By February 1995 she had found her source of passion and left Geldof for Michael Hutchence. But she would pay a terrible price for bagging what she called \"God's gift to women\" and a man who possessed the \"Taj Mahal of crotches\". </p> <p>Geldof was determined not to surrender custody of their three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie, and the bitterness of the split sapped the joy she found with Hutchence, whom she had fallen for deeply. \"She did really love Michael, she was mad about him,\" said a friend last night. But it was Hutchence who introduced Yates to a drink- and drug-fuelled lifestyle: \"That's when the spiral of decline started,\" the friend said. </p> <p>The break-up with Geldof was acrimonious and detailed by the tabloids, with Yates's connivance. She went to the house they had shared in Chelsea and after shouting abuse at him, threw a rock through a window. Friends were authorised to leak details of the bitter wrangle and Yates's financial straits as her debts at one stage reached \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>In May 1996 the divorce was granted, and Geldof later won temporary custody of the children after a sweet tube containing opium was found at the home of Yates and Hutchence. They claimed it was planted. </p> <p>If the fallout from her relationship with Geldof left Yates emotionally drained, the bizarre death of Michael Hutchence as good as broke her. The singer was found hanging in a Sydney hotel room in November 1997, having consumed vodka, beer, champagne, cocaine, Prozac and other prescription drugs. Yates could never accept it was suicide. The couple had a daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, who is now four years old. She described his death as like being \"flung to the dogs\", and tried to find comfort in Tiger Lily. </p> <p>Yates branded Geldof \"a killer\" after it emerged Hutchence had hanged himself with a leather belt hours after pleading with the former Boomtown Rat over the custody of Yates's daughters with Geldof. </p> <p>Yates later told an interviewer: \"When Michael died I was tipped over the edge. I was beyond grief. I went completely mad. </p> <p>\"Now I'm starting, relatively, to think straight again. I live one day at a time, one hour at a time. What makes it all worthwhile is my children.\" </p> <p><strong> Rapid decline</strong><br> </p> <p> Yates had to deal with more torment when it emerged that the man she thought was her father, the former Stars on Sunday star Jess Yates, was not. Her mother had had a relationship with the TV presenter Hughie Green and DNA tests showed that he was her real father. </p> <p>Her decline became more and more rapid. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with depression and in June 1998 lost custody of her three daughters from her relationship with Geldof and, though to the outside world apparently effervescent, tried to end it all. A friend found her and she was admitted to a clinic. </p> <p>Even there Yates found no stability. She began an affair with a heroin addict, which attracted more lurid tabloid headlines. The stories provoked Hutchence's family in Australia into proceedings to gain custody of Tiger Lily from Yates. When Yates ended the relationship, Hutchence's family dropped the lawsuit. </p> <p>Yates was again in the headlines when she had a relationship with the rock star Finlay Quaye. And in 1999 it was reported that she had collapsed while her daughters with Geldof were staying with her, and that police had to take the children away. </p> <p>Ms Wonfor, with whom Yates and her children stayed last year, said: \"There was a culmination of the madness that overtook her with Michael's death and the change of her father. She is quite a fragile creature. She probably never grew up and maybe that was to do with her difficult childhood; she needed an arm around her a lot.\" </p> <p>After the death of Hutchence, Yates was angered by news that Tiger Lily would only get \u00a32m from the singer's will and became locked in a dispute with his estate. </p> <p>An attempt at a television comeback flopped and earlier this year she won libel damages from the Mail on Sunday newspaper over claims she had deliberately and \"deceitfully\" become pregnant with Hutchence to try and ensnare him in a permanent relationship. </p> <p>She found no let-up at the Notting Hill home she moved to last year, where she was pursued by a stalker. </p> <p>Paula Yates made an art of getting what she desired: Geldof, fame, children and Hutchence.

An attempt at a television comeback flopped and earlier this year she won libel damages from the Mail on Sunday newspaper over claims she had deliberately and \"deceitfully\" become pregnant with Hutchence to try and ensnare him in a permanent relationship. She found no let-up at the Notting Hill home she moved to last year, where she was pursued by a stalker. Paula Yates made an art of getting what she desired: Geldof, fame, children and Hutchence. But ultimately, she could not get what she wanted: peace of mind. 1959 Paula Yates born to former Bluebell Girl Heller Toren.

Daft, because who gives a damn about sweating in the midst of passion? (If you disagree, visit a sex therapist.) Offensive because a) this huge image charged with sex is beaming down on kids, grannies and all, b) this woman is being defined by the sexual experience she offers - she is a \"quickie\" and c) the judgment of her sexual availability is being thrown to the viewer: if she looks a visible quickie to you, there is no need to check, just go for it. </p> <p>The use of sex is in your face, and a revival of 70s-style advertising when women were draped all over cars. As a similarly nonplussed former advertising executive said, \"It's like we've learnt nothing in the last 20 years. It's the laziest, least intelligent kind of advertising.\" It's nice to hear another adman putting the boot in, because one of the most frustrating things about this ad is that part of its purpose is to shock (denied, of course, by the manufacturers' spokeswoman). </p> <p>Benetton led the way in using shock: you make the ad an event so people write columns like this and you get more bang for your buck. Those who protest are corralled with Mary Whitehouse and the product's position is strengthened in its target market as youthful, hip, taboo-breaking. Even if the ad is not targeted at you, your outrage is exploited. The last time I complained about an ad, I inadvertently contributed to the strapline of the follow-up campaign which ran something along the lines of, \"Last time we ran this ad, women complained. No men.\" The protest is grist to the mill. Hard luck, you have no comeback over whatever some bunch of marketing execs decide to impose on your eyeballs. </p> <p>But there's a curious phenomenon here. Another ad in the same invisible deodorant campaign is of a young woman in a classic top-shelf pose, bum in the air, to illustrate her visible panty line. This is a new kind of raunchiness in advertising directed exclusively at women. The same thing is true in a different campaign for hair colour. A woman peeks down her bikini bottom to remind herself of her true hair colour. While this ad is mischievous, it isn't particularly offensive yet it has clocked up the most complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority of any so far this year - 175. Whereas we are used to sex being used to sell to men, this is a new departure, using it to sell to women. (The Renault campaign, \"Size matters\", is another example.) </p> <p>Given that all these ads will have been extensively researched with their target market of young women, they indicate a real shift in women's boundaries of what is acceptable in the ladette age - and it upsets people who don't like ladies to be crude. There's a subtle distinction here. Junking the sexist constraints on female humour is one thing (a good one). It is quite another to make a pernicious bid to pass off as sexually liberated (as the invisible deodorant campaign claims to be) what are really images of male desire. That would amount to women desiring what they think men desire. It's a classic form of oppression. </p> <p>And don't forget, all this fuss is only about a blasted deodorant.Why does boring deodorant have to be eroticised? Do women (as opposed to men) have an erotic relationship with their car? Are there no limits to the products sex is used to advertise? Will hot-water bottles, cocoa and slippers be next? Or could advertising go the way of modern art: the shock factor results in diminishing returns. Instead of sex making deodorant desirable, it makes sex about as desirable as deodorant. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there's no evidence so far that that is the case. Like it or not, advertising works. The \"personal care\" market - toothpaste, shampoo, soap, deodorant - has increased by \u00a3700m to an annual total of \u00a34.7bn in the past five years. We're not getting any dirtier, but clever marketing has convinced us to part with all those extra millions of pounds. And it's no longer just women; men spend \u00a365m more annually than they did five years ago. </p> <p> One of the ways they pulled off this coup was weaning us off a 100-year habit of buying bars of soap. Lever Brothers announced recently that they were no longer going to manufacture bars of Lux and Lifebuoy; they have lost out to the liquid-soap dispenser and the shower gel, dropping from a 40% share of the market to 20% in just five years. According to a Lever Brothers spokesman, the humble bar is not as hygienic. The other way to look at it is that a bar lasts for months and is far cheaper, while most liquid soap (the same combination of caustic soda, oil, fat and synthetic smells) goes swiftly down the plughole at twice the price. Meanwhile, another niche market emerges - for \"designer soaps\". The bar is manoeuvred into the luxury position (huge mark-up) in the market, complete with seaweed, wheatgerm oil and aloe vera. </p> <p>Our obsession with cleanliness is no trivial matter. It's a metaphor for Everything. Brad Pitt in the cult film Fight Club was a fraudulent soap salesman. His soap was handcrafted and tied with rough twine, but he made it from human fat stolen from the local crematorium. A comparable corruption underpins the personal-care industry, which manufactures millions of gallons of petrochemicals for us to pour down our drains in a bid for shiny hair and smooth skin. </p> <p>We city dwellers feel comforted by an ersatz relationship with nature as we smear ourselves in tea-tree oil and mud packs. This is a utilitarian relationship with nature, in which it becomes a treasure chest of consumer goodies. It's also a fake relationship with ourselves: frustrated female appetites are consoled with olfactory stimulation: bananas, strawberries, raspberries in the soap or bath oil. We delude ourselves that we are looking after ourselves, lying in our bath perfumed with lavender essential oil surrounded by scented candles, when we'd do our skin far more good if we gave up coffee, alcohol and the rat race. </p> <p>Finally, the cult of personal cleanliness is an ersatz religion. Our bathrooms ape a Catholic church - all smells and candles. These rituals of purification are comparable with those of devout Muslims, Jews or Hindus. The label on one lump of vegetable oil makes the point explicitly: \"a soft floral bouquet of pink and yellow flowers leads you down the path to nirvana\". Soap salvation. The \"cleanliness is next to godliness\" Puritans would have approved. All that's missing is the ritual sacrifice - the fatted calf. </p> <p>But is it? Perhaps we are the sacrifice: stewing in our baths in those brief pauses between frenzied earning and spending money on things we'd never dreamt of - like invisible deodorant. That then needs washing off - the admen have got us every time. </p>",

As one senior ITV network source said, \"It proves that the British do want to watch news broadcasts, but only when there's real news. Basically people are very happy to watch the news when it affects their pocket, their family or our boys abroad.\" </p> <p>The rolling news channels all notched up some of their best-ever ratings last week, with Sky News proving the star performer. The channel saw its daily share of viewing in multi-channel homes reach 2.98% on Wednesday at the peak of the crisis, 300% up on the channel's usual viewing figures and its highest audience share since the Kosovo war. Sky News reached a peak share of 6.54% between 3pm and 4pm on Wednesday, although by Thursday it was back down to 2.6%. Sky Digital viewers have also been able to access a dedicated fuel crisis channel on Sky News Active, the broadcaster's digital interactive news service. </p> <p>Its nearest rival was BBC News 24, which attracted a record number of viewers. An all-time high of 400,000 people tuned in on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons just before the Six O'Clock News. This was 54% up on the previous high of 260,000, which followed the Concorde crash, and also occurred just before 6pm. The average rating for the channel is around 20,000 viewers. </p> <p>ITN's new rolling news channel fared less well, garnering just 0.19% of all multi-channel homes on Tuesday and 0.32% on Wednesday, at the height of the crisis. However, ITN disputes these figures on the grounds that they do not include viewership in cable homes, an important platform for the broadcaster. Barb confirms the error. </p> <p>\"You can argue about who did better, but the one demonstrable fact is that rolling news channels are driven by good news stories,\" says Roger Mosey, head of television news at the BBC. \"If you compare it with newspaper circulations, which go up only fractionally at times like this whereas we've put on 50% or more, you see how much of a difference it makes.\" </p> <p>According to Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, the fuel crisis was the biggest domestic story so far this year and possibly the biggest since the Omagh bombing. \"In many ways, this has been the perfect story for rolling news,\" he says. \"We've not only covered the story; we've developed ways of giving lots of micro-information as well. People are interested in the developing story, but they also want to know what the implications are for them. We started a crisis information update on Tuesday, and BBC and ITV followed 24 hours later, which was quite satisfying. On Tuesday, we introduced the rolling tickertape, which is the perfect vehicle for detailed information which you can keep repeating.\" </p> <p>The rolling news channels' ratings were impressive overall, but in times of crisis people turn to what they know - BBC and ITV. Steve Anderson, head of news and current affairs at ITV, says, \"When a story breaks that touches the lives of everyone, affecting schools, hospitals and emergency services, people will tune in. Information is at a premium and a lot of people want it. The broadcasters have responded very well. It shows that when there's a big story, people want to come to ITV and BBC1 for their news.\" </p> <p>BBC1's Nine O'Clock News attracted roughly 8m viewers on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, around a third of the total TV market and well up on usual viewing figures. By Tuesday, BBC1 and ITV, having witnessed the success of the likes of Sky News, were interrupting the schedules to bring special news reports on the crisis. </p> <p>On Wednesday, ITV broke into the schedules to continue its lunchtime news all afternoon until the children's programmes began. Its ratings figures went up 50% to around 2m viewers, beating BBC1's lunchtime news. </p> <p> Then on Thursday, BBC1 followed suit, taking an hour-long feed of News 24 from midday - only the second time it has done so - and averaged 1.8m (34% share) in the first half-hour, beating the end of ITV's This Morning. So whereas ITV Lunchtime News had beaten BBC1 on Wednesday, by Thursday things were reversed. </p> <p>The hunger for the latest petrol news helped Tonight With Trevor McDonald to begin its autumn run on Wednesday with an impressive ratings win over Big Brother, after ITV decided to devote the entire show to the crisis. The programme attracted 6.7m viewers, giving it a 37% share, while 4.6m (21%) tuned in to Big Brother on Channel 4. </p> <p>The petrol crisis schadenfreude continued on the BBC, where the Nine O'Clock News attracted 8.5m viewers, an even better performance than on Tuesday night. And BBC1 held on to its late-evening lead by broadcasting a special \"Britain Running Dry\" report at 9.30pm in place of the scheduled 999. Nearly 8m people stayed tuned in to the channel for more on the fuel crisis. </p> <p>But for the BBC, this week's triumphs could turn out to be a mixed blessing. When the broadcaster moves its mid-evening news from 9pm to 10pm it will be hard-pressed to achieve viewing figures of anything like the 8m it achieved last week. And when it comes to comparing year-on-year figures, there could be some red faces at the corporation, which has insisted it will maintain viewer levels. </p> <p>\"These figures for the Nine O'Clock News may well come back to haunt them,\" says ITV's Anderson. \"The BBC has been getting ratings around the 8m mark and it will be impossible for them to match that at 10pm. There are simply more people watching television at 9pm than at 10pm. They will be enjoying this week, but it may well prove an embarrassment to them this time next year.\"</p>",

The Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents tanker drivers, is drawing up a dossier that it will send to the prime minister raising a number of complaints about the level of security at refineries at the height of the demonstrations last week. It also condemns police for \"failing\" to ensure safety on the roads surrounding the protests. General secretary Bill Morris said that an inquiry would be better than any \"knee-jerk\" response by ministers to implement new laws that could stop workers taking legitimate industrial action. The union said that its own investigations into the blockades had raised a number of questions, including: \u0095 Why were protesters able to park their vehicles in the private car park of a refinery overnight, later joining the blockade? \u0095 Why were there no security checks at some oil refineries and depots? \u0095 Why were members of the public given access to top security areas? \u0095 Why were drivers not given police escorts when many said that they would continue working normally if safety was guaranteed? \u0095 Why did police take no action against protesters shouting threats to drivers? Mr Morris said: \"This preliminary report raises a number of unanswered questions. The role of the police, the oil companies and the protesters all need to be investigated if we are to avoid blockades of this sort in the future. \"My members are keen to know why the police failed to use their considerable public order powers to restore safety to the roads.\" The union said that it wanted to know why oil companies failed to take out injunctions over the blockades and why police failed to challenge \"mass invasions\" of motorcyclists and taxi drivers. \"There should be a public inquiry into these events rather than a knee-jerk response,\" he said. \"The government should investigate why the existing legislation was not effective before they rush to implement new laws that would impinge on the rights of union members to take legitimate lawful action.\" Mr Morris stopped short of accusing police and oil companies of colluding with the protesters, although many union officials privately believe that this happened. The TGWU said that its drivers were questioning the \"inaction\" of oil companies to stop the protests last week. According to the union, the oil terminal at Fawley near Southampton was allowing protesters to park vehicles, including tractors, overnight last week.

Lower fuel prices mean higher demand for petrol and therefore increased C0<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p> <p>That's the bottom line, although there are other knock-on effects from rising car and truck usage - the increase in the number of cases of asthma, for example, or more deaths on the road. The car has killed more Americans than every war in US history; the protests last week appear to have been a real setback for saner environmental policies. </p> <p>There are two reasons why the government is now on the defensive - the less important being that farmers and truckers have a case. Figures show that higher prices are not that effective in cutting consumption, as demand for petrol is inelastic, with an increase in the price of 100% leading only to a 50% decline in usage. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why this is. Public transport is expensive, even when it is available. Not just in the Dales but in the suburbs as well, railway lines reflect the economic geography of the 19th century - heading in and out of city centres (especially London) rather than that of the 20th century, where people often live in one town and work across country. </p> <p>Ironically, many of those branch lines that seemed so anachronistic when Beeching axed them in the early 60s now look a lot more viable. The rail network cannot soak up demand displaced from the roads. Decades of under-investment in public transport means that train companies cannot put on extra services but have to squeeze more travellers onto the same number of trains. </p> <p>But there is a more important reason for the government having always been a bit wobbly when it comes to the environment. As Michael Jacobs, the director of the Fabian Society said in a pamphlet last year, New Labour associates environmentalism with ideas that it rejects, and believes that the majority of the public don't like them much either. </p> <p>\"As has now become familiar, New Labour identifies strongly - and wishes to be identified in the public mind - with ordinary families and their desires to get on in life. It sees environmentalism as at best an irrelevance to ordinary people, at worst as actively hostile to them. While middle England drives cars, enjoys shopping, wants material things and more foreign holidays, greens find consumption distasteful and their enthusiasm for curbing the car is symptomatic of their indifference to ordinary people's lives and opinions - something of which New Labour cannot be accused.\" </p> <p>All this might sound a bit harsh on the government. After all, it has introduced the climate change levy (albeit watered down after intensive lobbying from business), increased the fuel escalator to 6%, has introduced tax breaks for smaller and less polluting cars, and has announced a \u00a3180bn 10-year transport programme. But Jacobs is right. Deep down, the environment does not fit with the new Labour mindset. There is confusion between the sense that the environment is a big issue that over the long term cannot be ignored, and the short-term need to keep motorists, truckers and the Daily Mail off its back. That is why the transport white paper pulled its punches and proposed more road building. </p> <p>Labour's real problem, as was so blatantly obvious last week, is that it does not have a convincing story to tell. Extra billions in tax revenues have been rolling into the Treasury but the motorist and the road hauliers do not seem to have much to show for it. There has been a half-hearted attempt to show that dearer petrol means a better NHS, but absolutely nothing to suggest that it is part of a long-term strategy to make the environment an integral part of Labour's modernisation programme. </p> <p>This looks a long way off. Chris Hewett, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said in the latest edition of New Economy that ministers are obsessed with raising labour productivity but pay for too little attention to the need for improved efficiency from natural resources. He believes the government sees \"a false trade-off between prudent use of natural resources and economic progress\". </p> <p>Far from being opposing forces, environmentalism and modernisation are two sides of the same coin. If we do not revolutionise industry to make it greener the future looks bleak. To harness new technologies to make cars lighter and use cleaner fuels - such as fuel cells - is not only environmentally sound but modern and progressive as well. </p> <p>There are signs that a revolution in the automotive industry is coming, with cars made of lightweight but ultrastrong fibres rather than metal. Far from wasting resources trying to defend the indefensible, the government should be looking at an industrial policy that would involve serious investment in sustainable technologies - set to be one of the big growth areas in the west as environmental concerns move up the agenda - and regulation policies that encourage car and energy companies to speed up the transition to leaner and greener production. </p> <p>Mr Hewett says that Britain's expertise in offshore engineering skills could be used to develop a manufacturing base in offshore wind technology, but failure to provide help to solar panel manufacturers means that energy companies are going to the continent instead. </p> <p>What are the chances of the government getting to grips with a serious environmental agenda that would see the greening of industry as an opportunity and not as a threat?

Many of us nurture dreams of the day when we can change at Northallerton, potter up Wensleydale to Garsdale (the old Hawes Junction) before cruising down across Arten Gill and Dent Head on the Settle-Carlisle to Blea Moor tunnel and the Ribblehead viaduct. </p> <p>There's no harm in dreaming, because one day they may have to come true. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Sensibly, they relied on their muscle and their mobiles.</p> <p>There are, of course, ways that are un-British but none the less democratic. The French, whose society was founded on street violence, know that you must conciliate quickly or the gutters will run with blood and the tumbrels roll. It looks like caving in to us; to them it's keeping their heads. Literally.</p> <p>The French, unlike us, have a word for what the British protesters were doing - \"barrage\". It carries none of the baggage of \"blockade\" (U-boats), \"barricade\" (Russian revolution), or \"picket\" (armed guard). It means simply to bar, or stop something. A nice, neutral word that we don't have.</p> <p>The Americans also have a term: \"tax revolt\". For the thoughtful British observer, what comes to mind is less the Boston tea party than that most successful (and democratic) of recent interventions, \"Prop 13\".</p> <p>Following double-digit inflation in the early 70s, the price of housing in California exploded. Domestic property taxes (what we then called \"rates\") were assessed annually at 25% of full market value, and taxed at 4% of that figure. So if you had a house that you'd bought five years ago for $20,000 and it was now worth $100,000, your property taxes went up fivefold. Citizens were remortgaging their property to pay the property taxes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the governor in Sacramento was sitting on a huge budget surplus, generated by those same property taxes. California was rich while Californians were going broke. By 1978 the taxpayers were mad as hell. In California, if you can get enough registered voters to sign up, you can propose amendments to the state constitution. These propositions go to the ballot every two years, when the electors vote for their representatives to the state and federal government. There are usually between 10 and 20 propositions.</p> <p>If they are passed by a sufficient majority (as some 26 have been), the propositions go on to the statute book. They can be challenged later in court and overturned. But one way or another, Sacramento has to do more than listen. It must act. What Prop 13 did was to fix property taxes at 1% of the initial purchase price - for as long as you owned the property. The main winners were those who bought before 1980, because the assessments were made on 1975 valuations - before the really big price hike.</p> <p>But, in a rising market, everyone benefited. If, as I did in 1984, you bought a house in Los Angeles County for $250,000, the property tax would be $2,500 a year until you sold it - as I did, in 1992, for double the initial purchase price. My successor, poor schmuck, is paying $5,000 a year.</p> <p>Clearly Prop 13 is unfair and selfish. Householders in the same street pay wildly different rates - depending on when they bought. The state's tax income has slumped. So have the public schools and the community colleges that were once the state's pride. There is some question as to whether California can cope when the big one comes, so run down are its essential services.</p> <p>But Californians still like Prop 13. When they change their mind, they will introduce a counter-proposition. They have the right. It is a right they cherish, because it empowers them against the rich interest groups who can lobby (ie bribe) the legislature. Some of the propositions aimed at the statute book are crazy, such as that last year banning gay marriage (already illegal in California). Some, such as that banning illegal immigrants getting free treatment in hospitals, are plain ugly. Some, such as the banning of bilingual education in schools, look ugly but, once adopted, turn out well. Some, such as the injunction to the insurance business to lower premiums for drivers, get mysteriously lost in the long grass of government.</p> <p>Of course, not even Californian taxpayers can revolt to reduce the price of gas - but why should they, when it is still only $1.60 (\u00a31 and pennies) a gallon?</p>",

The main winners were those who bought before 1980, because the assessments were made on 1975 valuations - before the really big price hike. But, in a rising market, everyone benefited. If, as I did in 1984, you bought a house in Los Angeles County for $250,000, the property tax would be $2,500 a year until you sold it - as I did, in 1992, for double the initial purchase price. My successor, poor schmuck, is paying $5,000 a year. Clearly Prop 13 is unfair and selfish. Householders in the same street pay wildly different rates - depending on when they bought. The state's tax income has slumped. So have the public schools and the community colleges that were once the state's pride. There is some question as to whether California can cope when the big one comes, so run down are its essential services. But Californians still like Prop 13. When they change their mind, they will introduce a counter-proposition. They have the right. It is a right they cherish, because it empowers them against the rich interest groups who can lobby (ie bribe) the legislature. Some of the propositions aimed at the statute book are crazy, such as that last year banning gay marriage (already illegal in California). Some, such as that banning illegal immigrants getting free treatment in hospitals, are plain ugly. Some, such as the banning of bilingual education in schools, look ugly but, once adopted, turn out well. Some, such as the injunction to the insurance business to lower premiums for drivers, get mysteriously lost in the long grass of government. Of course, not even Californian taxpayers can revolt to reduce the price of gas - but why should they, when it is still only $1.60 (\u00a31 and pennies) a gallon?",

The picture, which stars Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, went down a storm at both Cannes and Toronto. Last year's winner of this award, American Beauty, went on to clean up at the Oscars the following spring. \u0095 The Watcher (pictured), a Keanu Reeves-starring thriller about a serial killer tracking an FBI agent, remained at number one at the US box office for a second week, as cinemas recorded one of the lowest-grossing weekends in years. The film earned just $5.7m, the smallest take of any number one film since Super Bowl weekend in January 1997. Bait, a comedy starring Jamie Foxx, came in second with $5.5m. Gwyneth Paltrow's turn as a karaoke singer in Duets, directed by her dad, brought in $2m on 581 screens, thereby tying in ninth spot.

      "bodyText": "Northern rail services, as well as the country's largest super-tram system, could soon be boosted with a cash injection from Manchester's booming airport. The government is considering giving the council-owned airport, Britain's third largest, powers to invest in rail franchises and in Railtrack, which owns lines and stations, as well as in other commercial ventures. With a \u00a3300m annual turnover, the airport is on the verge of taking a multi-million pound stake in Greater Manchester's Metrolink super-tram system. That will kick-start a \u00a3500m expansion, heralded as the biggest public transport programme outside London for over 50 years. It would more than double the size of Metrolink and pave the way for other tram projects in big cities - notably Birmingham. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, who has authorised a \u00a3250m government grant to extend the Greater Manchester tram network, sees Metrolink as the most effective way of curbing car use and a model for the rest of Britain. Most of the remaining cash has been guaranteed by private companies. Studies by the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive show that well over 10m car journeys annually could be cut in the conurbation once the network is complete. Already alongside parts of the 19-mile route between Bury and Altrincham, opened in 1992, the executive says more than 20% of morning peak journeys are being made by Metrolink and at weekends that figure can rise to almost 50%. But the involvement of the airport, owned by the 10 councils in Greater Manchester and one of the largest publicly-owned enterprises in Britain, heralds a new dimension for both rail and tram services. Although the government has lifted restrictions on the airport borrowing on the open market, directors say it is still prevented from using its considerable assets to invest outside its core business. While Metrolink is a grey area, they believe investment in a direct 13-mile route to the airport and south Manchester - one of four new extensions in the pipeline - would be allowed by Mr Prescott. Traffic congestion would also be considerably reduced because many of the 1,900 airport staff and 17,000 working at related business could switch from cars to trams. But the airport, which made a \u00a340m profit last year, wants to be a much bigger transport player in the north by investing directly in rail services, and maybe taking a stake in Railtrack. Although the airport now incorporates a station, with links to Yorkshire and the north-east, a direct connection to the west coast main line - and hence to the Midlands and London - would considerably boost passengers and take the heat off the overcrowded south-east. Rowena Burns, corporate affairs director of Manchester airport, said: \"There is potential across the north of England for working with other transport operators.\" Joint ventures with rail franchisees, and Railtrack, could be attractive in areas \"which serve our needs and theirs\". Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, the largest shareholder in the airport, said he believed the government had now accepted the need for the airport to be given greater powers. They had been prevented from acting by the shortage of parliamentary time. \"It is important for the airport to expand and become an even bigger powerhouse in the north-west economy.\" Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, has said the government is sympathetic to the principle of what the airport is trying to achieve. It could be given enhanced powers which would enable it to compete on an equal footing with BAA, owners of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The former nationalised company has extensive property interests and also owns the high-speed Heathrow express rail link from Paddington to Heathrow.",

The country is in the middle of a public health crisis as decades of furious tobacco consumption mature into a full-blown epidemic of smoking related deaths, currently running at an average of 35,000 a year. Hungarians are third in the world league of smokers, behind the Russians and Poles, and the legacy of their love affair with tobacco is a full waiting room in Mr Nemeth's diagnostic clinic in the picturesque town of Pecs. A brass plaque bolted next to the entrance proudly proclaims that the clinic is sponsored by British American Tobacco.</p> <p>When asked about the link Mr Nemeth's face takes on a pained expression. \"We have to use anything we can for the sake of the patients,\" he says. \"If an international company is willing to spend money on Hungarian welfare then it's something we can't refuse, especially with the economy in the state it's in at the moment.\"</p> <p>BAT has a large cigarette factory in the centre of this town churning out several million \"sticks\" a year of Sopiane, the country's most popular smoke. It is hard to avoid its presence, from the abundance of little brass sponsorship plaques around the place to the smell of raw tobacco that wafts through the streets. As the cash-strapped central government is increasingly pulling out of funding large areas of its health, education and welfare system the big tobacco companies are finding a ready welcome for their sponsorship money.</p> <p>A short taxi ride from the clinic is the town's homeless hostel, or BAT House, as it has been renamed. This shelter would have been closed down a long time ago without the tobacco money, says its manager Laszlo Fonai. \"We did have some criticism for accepting the money,\" he said, \"but it was only from people who had their applications for sponsorship refused.\" Just down the road from the shelter is the BAT Theatre, itself just across from the town hall where the company's executives have been invited to sit on several local government committees. \"They get invited to all the high-up meetings in this town,\" says an agitated-looking Mayor Lazlo Toller. \"They have influence and they give us a lot of advice on marketing, there is nothing wrong with that.\" His discomfort it turns out is due to the fact that he has just given up a 20-a-day habit.</p> <p>Just about every cultural event in the town receives tobacco money. Sponsorship is still a relatively new concept to Hungary, which emerged from decades of communist state control just over 10 years ago. The recipients in this town are more grateful for the money than worried that they may be providing a cosy image for a company whose products are damaging their health.</p> <p>Some however are beginning to learn the hard way the difference between donations and sponsorhip. In her office overlooking the medieval quarter, Maria Torocsik, vice-rector for marketing for the university of Pecs, attempts to weave her way through some delicate negotiations with BAT. The company has put up the money for the university's media centre, paying for a television studio and equipment. All well and good, until BAT asked the university to scrap its no-smoking policy. \"We are having a disagreement with BAT at the moment. I would like to insist that smoking should stay outside the building,\" says Mrs Torocsik. BAT insists it simply wants to create what it calls a \"cultured atmosphere\" for students who smoke.</p> <p>The company is doing nothing illegal - and in fact across Hungary its competitors, such as Germany's Reemtsma AG and Philip Morris, are all pumping millions of dollars into similar projects. Sponsoring worthy causes is an integral part of their marketing strategies.</p> <p>A favourite activity for the big tobacco companies is to sponsor anti-smoking campaigns in schools. The campaigns have been spectacularly unsuccessful, with the result that smoking among secondary-school pupils has shot up by 20%. \"This is just a trick by the tobacco industry,\" says Tibor Silargy, secretary of House 21, which raises funds for health-promotion campaigns. \"For five years now they've been sponsoring campaigns that have constantly proved to be totally ineffective.\"</p> <p>Its these sorts of activities that have led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to organise hearings in October to persuade 191 countries to sign up to a treaty that will make it legally binding to severely restrict tobacco advertising and sponsorship deals.</p> <p>The tobacco giants realise they face a double threat, not only from the WHO but also from the European Union. One of the conditions of countries like Hungary joining the EU is that they clamp down on cigarette advertising and commercial sponsorship. What will still be allowed, however, is corporate sponsorship, where money is given out to good causes. The suspicion among critics is that this will simply become another avenue for their marketing campaigns.</p> <p>\"We cannot live in a vacuum,\" says Gabor Racz of BAT Hungary. \"We have to be an organic part of any community we are in because if the town is suffering then our workers will suffer too.\" He sees no irony in his company's sponsorship of a diagnostic clinic. He is still not convinced that there is a link between smoking and any diseases of the body. \"Doctors and surgeons are grown adults and professionals, they can decide themselves if they want to accept the cash. If anyone thinks we don't have the right to give this money then why don't they give it instead?\"</p> <p>One man in Pecs is attempting to organise some sort of a stand against this apparently unending stream of cash from BAT. As the local representative of the WHO, Antonio De Blasio has made it his mission to try and get locals to kick the habit not only of cigarettes but of sponsorship money. \"I know it's very hard but they must realise that this is dirty money,\" he says.</p> <p>Many Hungarians however do not see the problem and if they do, don't believe they can afford to debate the pro and cons of tobacco money. Outside the clinic's doors a knot of patients waiting for a scan gather for a quick smoke, coughing away, before stubbing out their cigarettes and hurrying back inside. They don't want to miss their place in the queue.</p>",

The suspicion among critics is that this will simply become another avenue for their marketing campaigns. \"We cannot live in a vacuum,\" says Gabor Racz of BAT Hungary. \"We have to be an organic part of any community we are in because if the town is suffering then our workers will suffer too.\" He sees no irony in his company's sponsorship of a diagnostic clinic. He is still not convinced that there is a link between smoking and any diseases of the body. \"Doctors and surgeons are grown adults and professionals, they can decide themselves if they want to accept the cash. If anyone thinks we don't have the right to give this money then why don't they give it instead?\" One man in Pecs is attempting to organise some sort of a stand against this apparently unending stream of cash from BAT. As the local representative of the WHO, Antonio De Blasio has made it his mission to try and get locals to kick the habit not only of cigarettes but of sponsorship money. \"I know it's very hard but they must realise that this is dirty money,\" he says. Many Hungarians however do not see the problem and if they do, don't believe they can afford to debate the pro and cons of tobacco money. Outside the clinic's doors a knot of patients waiting for a scan gather for a quick smoke, coughing away, before stubbing out their cigarettes and hurrying back inside. They don't want to miss their place in the queue.",

      "body": "<p>You probably think the Olympic Games is a vastly important event for all of us Australians, a huge national rite that will \"put us on the map\" - the same map, presumably, on which the last Australian Olympics, in Melbourne in 1956, failed to inscribe us. Actually, despite our traditional obsession with sports, despite the coercive drumming of pre-Olympics hype, some of us don't care that much about the Olympics. We think we matter for other reasons. We suspect we're on the map already.</p> <p>Australians tend to be natural pagans. Everything favours this: the delicious climate of the coasts; the dramatic and seductive landscapes of pounding surf and golden sand; the tanned bodies strutting; the food (some of the finest in the world); and the wines, which are superb. In such a setting, Australians have evolved a natural ethos as pleasure seekers in all areas of life. As the writer David Malouf points out, we don't even think of ourselves as hedonists, because that would be too self-conscious. Australian culture is for the most part deeply democratic, and joyously so as well. It is no longer \"provincial\", a distant and nervous response to norms generated in imperial centres. It is the result of a bloodless and slow-developing social revolution conducted over 40 years as a small society grew larger and immeasurably more complex, shook off its sense of derivative Englishness and its fear of American domination, and learned to trust its own talents.</p> <p>But a reasonable equipoise is with us only some of the time. Jingoism still disfigures the lowbrow end of our journalism. \"One of the ways in which we have matured is that we don't give a stuff about what other people think,\" blustered the columnist Susan Mitchell in the Australian, a national daily, last month. \"We no longer feel we have to explain ourselves to anyone but ourselves.\"</p> <p>This dismal, Serbian-style solipsism was actually meant as self-praise. But on some levels it is, alas, true. One sees it, for instance, in the bristling posture of denial that the Australian government recently took against UN criticism of its flouting of the human rights of aborigines. Australians still tend to be worried about what outsiders think, keep asking and then get furious if the answer is even fractionally less than flattering.</p> <p>Australia is often seen, especially in the US, as the last stand of the wild west, the place and ethos that were buried in America a century ago: a celluloid fiction, reinvented with kangaroos. In reality, Australians are among the most urbanised people on earth. They have seen their national animal, the kangaroo, only in a zoo or as roadkill on the highway. Nearly 90% of Australians live on the coast, not in the outback, wherever that elusive place may be. Our country towns are in decline. Their inhabitants keep moving to the coast. Because Australia has no fertile centre, there is no place for them in that immense, empty outback.</p> <p>So the \"typical Australian\" is not, as foreigners once thought, a bushman. He is a slightly worried guy with a tan, a bald spot, a mortgage, a mower and two kids, whose Australian dream is a double-front brick bungalow on a quarter-acre lot in the suburbs less than 30 minutes' drive from the nearest beach, with two other nice, two-kid, one-PC families on either side of him.</p> <p>And yet there are traits that do, indisputably, come down to modern Australia from the vanished days of the bush, and even from the convict era. They are wound tightly into our social history. One of these is the value set on \"mateship\". Essentially male bonding, mateship began in the harsh world of the penal settlement. It continued in the hardly less tough environment of labour that was the lot of most men in the bush: shearers, station hands and shepherds. To have a mate was to survive; to betray that mate was to be a scab, less than a man; such was the hard calculus of colonial life, and its traces are very much alive in Australia today.</p> <p>A less admirable trait is the Australian fetish of anti-elitism. If you want to nuke an enemy, call them an elitist, especially if they are an intellectual. The word is empty, since no society has ever been able to function without elites of skill, intelligence and ordinary competence. Yet Australians can rarely bring themselves to say they value human superiority. It sounds undemocratic.</p> <p>The one field of exception to this unseemly prejudice is sport, the real religion of down under. The idea of non-elitist sport is, of course, an absurdity. No Australian would waste their time watching a football match in which nobody was better than anyone else, or a horse race in which every nag plunked along at exactly the same speed. And, of course, Australians find no contradiction in that. Ours is the meritocracy that dare not speak its name.</p> <p>Some Australians will tell you they have a classless society. This is the merest fantasy. We began with the most ironbound of all class distinctions, between prisoners and the free. The freeborn (the \"sterling\") were bitterly opposed to giving up their social placement above the ex-convicts and their children (the \"currency\"). But the \"lower orders\" fiercely resented the pretensions of the nobs and were well aware that in a pioneer environment lady luck was a more powerful queen than Victoria Regina. Today's Australians may be more sophisticated than the 19th-century digger with his pockets full of gold dust, but at root the dot.com millionaires of the late 90s are not so different from their mining ancestors. The metaphor of all wealth production is gambling, and Australians are among the most shamefully obsessed gamblers in the world. We have 20 times as many \"pokies\" - poker machines - per person as the Americans. Our styles of wealth production enforce the belief that superiority is luck and only luck: no moral lessons apply.</p> <p>We are poor at symbolising ourselves. Many of us would like to snip the union jack off our flag, but no one can agree on a new design. Our official Olympic mascots and emblems are kitsch, climaxing last month in the Great Medal Screwup. It turned out that all the Olympic medals had been designed to feature not the Parthenon in Athens, not even the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, but the Colosseum in Rome, less noted for Olympic-style friendship than for gladiatorial butchery. What the hell, the officials of the Sydney organising committee of the Olympic Games apparently reasoned; it's still the ancient world, right? Then it befell some luckless Socog flunky to claim it wasn't meant to be the Colosseum, just a colosseum. Nice try, kid. It was too late to make new medals.</p> <p>Apart from the kangaroo, the koala and other enchanting marsupials, Australia seems short of identity icons. There is, of course, Ayers Rock, the most sublime stone on earth. There is also the incomparable Great Barrier Reef, a single coral organism some 1,250 miles long. We have two famous structures, both in Sydney: the harbour bridge and the opera house, the latter a masterpiece by the Danish architect Jorn Utzon. Perched on one of the world's most beautiful sites, a headland in Sydney Harbour, and surrounded on three sides by sapphire water, this great building was never seen in completion by its architect. He resigned under stress and never came back to Sydney, so that the promise of those lovely tiled arcs and shells is not fulfilled by the interior, awkwardly finished by a local designer.</p> <p>Where it counts - which is more in production than interpretation - Australia has a vigorous cultural life. The list of first-rank Australian novelists, headed up by Murray Bail, Peter Carey and David Malouf - writers of exceptional power and social insight - is a considerable one. It has also produced a brilliant biographer and diagnostician of past culture in Peter Conrad, an erudite and dark-minded expatriate from Tasmania. Books, of course, circulate everywhere, whereas paintings and buildings do not. Consequently major architects such as Glenn Murcutt and Philip Cox are little known outside Australia. This is a pity, and even worse is the general ignorance of Australian contemporary painting. It is bizarre that artists as excellent as John Olsen, Colin Lanceley, Tim Storrier and Mike Parr aren't the world figures they deserve to be. The only Australian art that attracts much overseas attention is contemporary aboriginal art, which varies enormously in quality.</p> <p>The clarity of Australian cultural achievement is often muddied by our most irksome cultural shortcoming: a peevishly insecure hatred of \"tall poppies\", people distinguished by their achievements in any area. Australia has never honoured its artists, intellectuals, writers and musicians as fully as its sports figures; there is always an undertow of resentment, of the lowbrows' residual suspicion that the highbrow is conning them. Everyone bitches about this; nobody does anything about it. It is hardwired into us, a proof of \"toughness\".</p> <p>Under valued culturally, Australia is also politically obscure. Why? Because we're so well behaved. We are not the mouse that roared. Historically, we have rarely even contemplated roaring. As the former prime minister Paul Keating has pointed out, Australia has always been short of the defining value systems that are gained through conflict. We have never had a civil war or a revolution. We have never been invaded - though we nearly were during the second world war, by the Japanese. Nobody has ever called us a Great Satan or even a little one. We tend to like Americans more than most nations do, although we do not have the least desire to be like them.</p> <p>Historically, Australia felt little resentment about its colonial control by Britain and its sovereign. Its population was heavy with Irishmen and Irishwomen, but the resentments their ancestors had brought with them soon mellowed into ineffectuality in the antipodean sun. As a colony we were content to fulfil our destiny, which was to supply Britain with cheap wheat, wool and (when required) cannon fodder for wars against the Boers or the Huns.</p> <p>In these, we had little or no stake of our own. Britain, with grim enthusiasm, condemned us to assist in the creation of dead colonial heroes. In the first world war, Australia lost 59,258 young men out of a total of 330,000 sent abroad. Both as a proportion of troops killed or missing and as a proportion of the national population, this was the highest figure for any allied state.</p> <p>It left us in the 20s as a psychologically devastated nation of widows, spinsters and orphans. This enormous death toll was rationalised as a cleansing, an erasure of the inherited stain of the convict era. Winston Churchill, who sent our grandfathers to die on the implacable slopes of Gallipoli, was by no means the only Englishman to think they came from \"tainted\" stock.</p> <p>Australia still had a largely colonial mentality when I was born, in 1938. Only vestiges of it survive today. The most important of these relics is, of course, its monarchy. It is a bizarre fact that no Australian can be the country's head of state. That role is reserved for the king or queen of England, by definition a foreigner, and not even an elected one: the office of the Australian head of state remains purely hereditary, open only to a small clan of Anglo-German squillionaires known as the Windsors. This narrows the field of talent.</p> <p>According to the Australian constitution - a document written for us by the British at the turn of the century - it is ultimately the British monarch who rules Australia through an unelected viceroy, the governor-general. This official may be Australian or may not. They may, on behalf of the King or Queen, cancel any law enacted by the Australian government or even throw out the government and call for new elections. Or they may not. In practice they almost never do. The last and only time they did was in 1975, when the governor-general, Sir John Kerr, fired the Labor government led by Gough Whitlam.</p> <p>This caused shock and resentment. Millions of Australians felt that Whitlam, their hero, the great reformer of government policy in the domains of race, immigration, foreign policy and the arts, had been stolen from them. There are still plenty of people around who regard this as not far from a coup d'\u00e9tat.</p> <p>The firing of Whitlam made many Australians sit up with a jerk. It had never occurred to them before that the Queen had the raw constitutional power to do such a thing. It cranked up the long-dormant impulse toward republicanism. Until the 70s this had been an issue only for intellectuals and a few leftwing workers whose vehemence earned them an undeserved reputation as ratbags (obsessed eccentrics). The problem was democratising the republican issue while detaching it from the ownership of the Australian left. And it did slowly broaden, though its main political instrument, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM), didn't come into existence until the 80s.</p> <p>The growth of republican feeling in Australia coincided with, and was strongly encouraged by, the prime ministership (1991-96) of Keating, a brilliant and abrasive Laborite much feared for his insults (\"pansies\" and \"unrepresentative swill\" were among the milder epithets he launched at his foes in parliamentary debate) and greatly misunderstood for his tastes: given his passions for antique French clocks and Georgian furniture, Keating was the most cultivated Australian ever to serve as prime minister. The ARM's chief unelected backer was a formidable young merchant banker named Malcolm Turnbull. (Full disclosure obliges me to say that Turnbull is married to my niece Lucy, herself the deputy lord mayor of Sydney.) Despite Keating's defeat in the 1996 elections, Turnbull and his fellow republicans were able to bring the republic issue to a nationwide vote last year.</p> <p>The result was a triumph of electoral timidity, worsened by fake populism. By a queer flip-flop of logic, a majority of Australian voters (55% to 45%) decided that to have an Australian president appointed by a democratically-elected government was elitist and unsafe, whereas to have an immensely rich hereditary monarch as their head of state was somehow democratic.</p> <p>The monarchists won the referendum, not because Australians were devoted to the Queen and her successors but because feuding republicans couldn't agree on which model of republic to uphold. Should the new-style head of state, an Australian president, be appointed by parliament? Or should they be elected in a national campaign, in the American manner? The ARM wanted the former, but Australians hated the idea of an American-style republic - or American-style anything - in their public life. This split the republican vote, to the boundless relief of the monarchists, who could never have carried the issue on their own.</p> <p>Soon after the referendum, the Queen and her cold fish of a consort, Prince Philip, toured Australia. The crowds were small and more curious than enthusiastic; the media polite but indifferent. The romantic, near-mystical queen worship that had surrounded her tour in 1954 was gone forever. Being smarter than the monarchists, the Queen could easily read the signs. She openly acknowledged the possibility of a stable republic in Australia.</p> <p>The current prime minister, John Howard, is an obdurate monarchist. But the next in line as head of his conservative Liberal party, Peter Costello, is a republican. The Australian Labor party is republican through and through. It is only a matter of time before the less reactionary and nostalgic Liberal politicians come out of the closet, and then the monarchy in Australia will be finished.</p> <p>It is hard to say why, apart from habit, there should be any nostalgia for royal forms among Australians, especially when we are so fond of our national anti-elitism. But people, including Australians, want figures to admire. \"If we don't have the Queen, whom can we look up to?\" was one of the frequent complaints at referendum time. The thought that in a democracy you don't look up to your superiors, but sideways at your fellow citizens, wasn't much aired in monarchist circles. And Australia has always been short not only of convincing shared ceremonies of national identity but also of shared folk heroes. You can count them on the fingers of two hands. Two are alive - the great cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, now 91, and the swimming champion Dawn Fraser. The veterans of Gallipoli, a few of whom still live, are invested with a collective heroism. The other heroes are dead. They include a racehorse, Phar Lap; and a criminal, the bushranger, Irish nationalist and proto-republican Ned Kelly, hanged for theft and murder in Melbourne in 1880.</p> <p>Another reason why some Australians want to keep the monarchy is unease about mixture. The Queen evokes the loyalty and gratitude of the \"pure\" Anglo-Australian because she personifies \"pure\" Britain. This worked fine half a century ago, when more than 90% of Australians were still of British descent and could feel themselves to be, as the then prime minister Robert Menzies would later put it, \"British to the boot heels\". But today the picture of exclusionary Australia, the continent-size British island just below Asia, has almost faded away. The white Australia policy, that disgraceful provision whereby no one of Asian or black descent could settle in Australia, was abandoned in the 60s, never to be revived. Whole suburbs, such as Cabramatta in western Sydney, have become south-east Asian enclaves. Though Australia admits only some 85,000 legal immigrants a year, the Asian component is very visible and it excites xenophobia.

      "bodyText": "You probably think the Olympic Games is a vastly important event for all of us Australians, a huge national rite that will \"put us on the map\" - the same map, presumably, on which the last Australian Olympics, in Melbourne in 1956, failed to inscribe us. Actually, despite our traditional obsession with sports, despite the coercive drumming of pre-Olympics hype, some of us don't care that much about the Olympics. We think we matter for other reasons. We suspect we're on the map already. Australians tend to be natural pagans. Everything favours this: the delicious climate of the coasts; the dramatic and seductive landscapes of pounding surf and golden sand; the tanned bodies strutting; the food (some of the finest in the world); and the wines, which are superb. In such a setting, Australians have evolved a natural ethos as pleasure seekers in all areas of life. As the writer David Malouf points out, we don't even think of ourselves as hedonists, because that would be too self-conscious. Australian culture is for the most part deeply democratic, and joyously so as well. It is no longer \"provincial\", a distant and nervous response to norms generated in imperial centres. It is the result of a bloodless and slow-developing social revolution conducted over 40 years as a small society grew larger and immeasurably more complex, shook off its sense of derivative Englishness and its fear of American domination, and learned to trust its own talents. But a reasonable equipoise is with us only some of the time. Jingoism still disfigures the lowbrow end of our journalism. \"One of the ways in which we have matured is that we don't give a stuff about what other people think,\" blustered the columnist Susan Mitchell in the Australian, a national daily, last month. \"We no longer feel we have to explain ourselves to anyone but ourselves.\" This dismal, Serbian-style solipsism was actually meant as self-praise. But on some levels it is, alas, true. One sees it, for instance, in the bristling posture of denial that the Australian government recently took against UN criticism of its flouting of the human rights of aborigines. Australians still tend to be worried about what outsiders think, keep asking and then get furious if the answer is even fractionally less than flattering. Australia is often seen, especially in the US, as the last stand of the wild west, the place and ethos that were buried in America a century ago: a celluloid fiction, reinvented with kangaroos. In reality, Australians are among the most urbanised people on earth. They have seen their national animal, the kangaroo, only in a zoo or as roadkill on the highway. Nearly 90% of Australians live on the coast, not in the outback, wherever that elusive place may be. Our country towns are in decline. Their inhabitants keep moving to the coast. Because Australia has no fertile centre, there is no place for them in that immense, empty outback. So the \"typical Australian\" is not, as foreigners once thought, a bushman. He is a slightly worried guy with a tan, a bald spot, a mortgage, a mower and two kids, whose Australian dream is a double-front brick bungalow on a quarter-acre lot in the suburbs less than 30 minutes' drive from the nearest beach, with two other nice, two-kid, one-PC families on either side of him. And yet there are traits that do, indisputably, come down to modern Australia from the vanished days of the bush, and even from the convict era. They are wound tightly into our social history. One of these is the value set on \"mateship\". Essentially male bonding, mateship began in the harsh world of the penal settlement. It continued in the hardly less tough environment of labour that was the lot of most men in the bush: shearers, station hands and shepherds. To have a mate was to survive; to betray that mate was to be a scab, less than a man; such was the hard calculus of colonial life, and its traces are very much alive in Australia today. A less admirable trait is the Australian fetish of anti-elitism. If you want to nuke an enemy, call them an elitist, especially if they are an intellectual. The word is empty, since no society has ever been able to function without elites of skill, intelligence and ordinary competence. Yet Australians can rarely bring themselves to say they value human superiority. It sounds undemocratic. The one field of exception to this unseemly prejudice is sport, the real religion of down under. The idea of non-elitist sport is, of course, an absurdity. No Australian would waste their time watching a football match in which nobody was better than anyone else, or a horse race in which every nag plunked along at exactly the same speed. And, of course, Australians find no contradiction in that. Ours is the meritocracy that dare not speak its name. Some Australians will tell you they have a classless society. This is the merest fantasy. We began with the most ironbound of all class distinctions, between prisoners and the free. The freeborn (the \"sterling\") were bitterly opposed to giving up their social placement above the ex-convicts and their children (the \"currency\"). But the \"lower orders\" fiercely resented the pretensions of the nobs and were well aware that in a pioneer environment lady luck was a more powerful queen than Victoria Regina. Today's Australians may be more sophisticated than the 19th-century digger with his pockets full of gold dust, but at root the dot.com millionaires of the late 90s are not so different from their mining ancestors. The metaphor of all wealth production is gambling, and Australians are among the most shamefully obsessed gamblers in the world. We have 20 times as many \"pokies\" - poker machines - per person as the Americans. Our styles of wealth production enforce the belief that superiority is luck and only luck: no moral lessons apply. We are poor at symbolising ourselves. Many of us would like to snip the union jack off our flag, but no one can agree on a new design. Our official Olympic mascots and emblems are kitsch, climaxing last month in the Great Medal Screwup. It turned out that all the Olympic medals had been designed to feature not the Parthenon in Athens, not even the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, but the Colosseum in Rome, less noted for Olympic-style friendship than for gladiatorial butchery. What the hell, the officials of the Sydney organising committee of the Olympic Games apparently reasoned; it's still the ancient world, right? Then it befell some luckless Socog flunky to claim it wasn't meant to be the Colosseum, just a colosseum. Nice try, kid. It was too late to make new medals. Apart from the kangaroo, the koala and other enchanting marsupials, Australia seems short of identity icons. There is, of course, Ayers Rock, the most sublime stone on earth. There is also the incomparable Great Barrier Reef, a single coral organism some 1,250 miles long. We have two famous structures, both in Sydney: the harbour bridge and the opera house, the latter a masterpiece by the Danish architect Jorn Utzon. Perched on one of the world's most beautiful sites, a headland in Sydney Harbour, and surrounded on three sides by sapphire water, this great building was never seen in completion by its architect. He resigned under stress and never came back to Sydney, so that the promise of those lovely tiled arcs and shells is not fulfilled by the interior, awkwardly finished by a local designer. Where it counts - which is more in production than interpretation - Australia has a vigorous cultural life. The list of first-rank Australian novelists, headed up by Murray Bail, Peter Carey and David Malouf - writers of exceptional power and social insight - is a considerable one. It has also produced a brilliant biographer and diagnostician of past culture in Peter Conrad, an erudite and dark-minded expatriate from Tasmania. Books, of course, circulate everywhere, whereas paintings and buildings do not. Consequently major architects such as Glenn Murcutt and Philip Cox are little known outside Australia. This is a pity, and even worse is the general ignorance of Australian contemporary painting. It is bizarre that artists as excellent as John Olsen, Colin Lanceley, Tim Storrier and Mike Parr aren't the world figures they deserve to be. The only Australian art that attracts much overseas attention is contemporary aboriginal art, which varies enormously in quality. The clarity of Australian cultural achievement is often muddied by our most irksome cultural shortcoming: a peevishly insecure hatred of \"tall poppies\", people distinguished by their achievements in any area. Australia has never honoured its artists, intellectuals, writers and musicians as fully as its sports figures; there is always an undertow of resentment, of the lowbrows' residual suspicion that the highbrow is conning them. Everyone bitches about this; nobody does anything about it. It is hardwired into us, a proof of \"toughness\". Under valued culturally, Australia is also politically obscure. Why? Because we're so well behaved. We are not the mouse that roared. Historically, we have rarely even contemplated roaring. As the former prime minister Paul Keating has pointed out, Australia has always been short of the defining value systems that are gained through conflict. We have never had a civil war or a revolution. We have never been invaded - though we nearly were during the second world war, by the Japanese. Nobody has ever called us a Great Satan or even a little one. We tend to like Americans more than most nations do, although we do not have the least desire to be like them. Historically, Australia felt little resentment about its colonial control by Britain and its sovereign. Its population was heavy with Irishmen and Irishwomen, but the resentments their ancestors had brought with them soon mellowed into ineffectuality in the antipodean sun. As a colony we were content to fulfil our destiny, which was to supply Britain with cheap wheat, wool and (when required) cannon fodder for wars against the Boers or the Huns. In these, we had little or no stake of our own. Britain, with grim enthusiasm, condemned us to assist in the creation of dead colonial heroes. In the first world war, Australia lost 59,258 young men out of a total of 330,000 sent abroad. Both as a proportion of troops killed or missing and as a proportion of the national population, this was the highest figure for any allied state. It left us in the 20s as a psychologically devastated nation of widows, spinsters and orphans. This enormous death toll was rationalised as a cleansing, an erasure of the inherited stain of the convict era. Winston Churchill, who sent our grandfathers to die on the implacable slopes of Gallipoli, was by no means the only Englishman to think they came from \"tainted\" stock. Australia still had a largely colonial mentality when I was born, in 1938. Only vestiges of it survive today. The most important of these relics is, of course, its monarchy. It is a bizarre fact that no Australian can be the country's head of state. That role is reserved for the king or queen of England, by definition a foreigner, and not even an elected one: the office of the Australian head of state remains purely hereditary, open only to a small clan of Anglo-German squillionaires known as the Windsors. This narrows the field of talent. According to the Australian constitution - a document written for us by the British at the turn of the century - it is ultimately the British monarch who rules Australia through an unelected viceroy, the governor-general. This official may be Australian or may not. They may, on behalf of the King or Queen, cancel any law enacted by the Australian government or even throw out the government and call for new elections. Or they may not. In practice they almost never do. The last and only time they did was in 1975, when the governor-general, Sir John Kerr, fired the Labor government led by Gough Whitlam. This caused shock and resentment. Millions of Australians felt that Whitlam, their hero, the great reformer of government policy in the domains of race, immigration, foreign policy and the arts, had been stolen from them. There are still plenty of people around who regard this as not far from a coup d'\u00e9tat. The firing of Whitlam made many Australians sit up with a jerk. It had never occurred to them before that the Queen had the raw constitutional power to do such a thing. It cranked up the long-dormant impulse toward republicanism. Until the 70s this had been an issue only for intellectuals and a few leftwing workers whose vehemence earned them an undeserved reputation as ratbags (obsessed eccentrics). The problem was democratising the republican issue while detaching it from the ownership of the Australian left. And it did slowly broaden, though its main political instrument, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM), didn't come into existence until the 80s. The growth of republican feeling in Australia coincided with, and was strongly encouraged by, the prime ministership (1991-96) of Keating, a brilliant and abrasive Laborite much feared for his insults (\"pansies\" and \"unrepresentative swill\" were among the milder epithets he launched at his foes in parliamentary debate) and greatly misunderstood for his tastes: given his passions for antique French clocks and Georgian furniture, Keating was the most cultivated Australian ever to serve as prime minister. The ARM's chief unelected backer was a formidable young merchant banker named Malcolm Turnbull. (Full disclosure obliges me to say that Turnbull is married to my niece Lucy, herself the deputy lord mayor of Sydney.) Despite Keating's defeat in the 1996 elections, Turnbull and his fellow republicans were able to bring the republic issue to a nationwide vote last year. The result was a triumph of electoral timidity, worsened by fake populism. By a queer flip-flop of logic, a majority of Australian voters (55% to 45%) decided that to have an Australian president appointed by a democratically-elected government was elitist and unsafe, whereas to have an immensely rich hereditary monarch as their head of state was somehow democratic. The monarchists won the referendum, not because Australians were devoted to the Queen and her successors but because feuding republicans couldn't agree on which model of republic to uphold. Should the new-style head of state, an Australian president, be appointed by parliament? Or should they be elected in a national campaign, in the American manner? The ARM wanted the former, but Australians hated the idea of an American-style republic - or American-style anything - in their public life. This split the republican vote, to the boundless relief of the monarchists, who could never have carried the issue on their own. Soon after the referendum, the Queen and her cold fish of a consort, Prince Philip, toured Australia. The crowds were small and more curious than enthusiastic; the media polite but indifferent. The romantic, near-mystical queen worship that had surrounded her tour in 1954 was gone forever. Being smarter than the monarchists, the Queen could easily read the signs. She openly acknowledged the possibility of a stable republic in Australia. The current prime minister, John Howard, is an obdurate monarchist. But the next in line as head of his conservative Liberal party, Peter Costello, is a republican. The Australian Labor party is republican through and through. It is only a matter of time before the less reactionary and nostalgic Liberal politicians come out of the closet, and then the monarchy in Australia will be finished. It is hard to say why, apart from habit, there should be any nostalgia for royal forms among Australians, especially when we are so fond of our national anti-elitism. But people, including Australians, want figures to admire. \"If we don't have the Queen, whom can we look up to?\" was one of the frequent complaints at referendum time. The thought that in a democracy you don't look up to your superiors, but sideways at your fellow citizens, wasn't much aired in monarchist circles. And Australia has always been short not only of convincing shared ceremonies of national identity but also of shared folk heroes. You can count them on the fingers of two hands. Two are alive - the great cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, now 91, and the swimming champion Dawn Fraser. The veterans of Gallipoli, a few of whom still live, are invested with a collective heroism. The other heroes are dead. They include a racehorse, Phar Lap; and a criminal, the bushranger, Irish nationalist and proto-republican Ned Kelly, hanged for theft and murder in Melbourne in 1880. Another reason why some Australians want to keep the monarchy is unease about mixture. The Queen evokes the loyalty and gratitude of the \"pure\" Anglo-Australian because she personifies \"pure\" Britain. This worked fine half a century ago, when more than 90% of Australians were still of British descent and could feel themselves to be, as the then prime minister Robert Menzies would later put it, \"British to the boot heels\". But today the picture of exclusionary Australia, the continent-size British island just below Asia, has almost faded away. The white Australia policy, that disgraceful provision whereby no one of Asian or black descent could settle in Australia, was abandoned in the 60s, never to be revived. Whole suburbs, such as Cabramatta in western Sydney, have become south-east Asian enclaves. Though Australia admits only some 85,000 legal immigrants a year, the Asian component is very visible and it excites xenophobia. The role of the Queen as head of state has a calming effect, suggesting that the \"old\" Anglo-Australia is still notionally within reach. Compared with their older selves, Australians - especially the younger ones - are a tolerant people. We are one of the world's most successful multicultural democracies, and this is a triumph of no small consequence. Australians on the whole realise that multiculturalism, that forbiddingly bureaucratic polysyllable responsible for so much hot air, really means learning to read other people's image banks, not a forced renunciation of one's own. They realise, quite naturally, that the desire to \"give people a fair go\", which is one of the traditional moral imperatives of Australian life, also applies to immigrants. This does not, however, mean that Australia's road to multi-culturalism has been stoneless. Translated into government policy, multi-culturalism in the 80s became, its critics say, not just a neutral recognition of diversity but a pork barrel for buying the temporary loyalties of ethnic groups. Maybe, but it doesn't ultimately matter. Immigration has done its work. It has changed Australia irrevocably. Nobody old enough to remember the dullness of its old monocultural cuisine can regret that. The British empire has gone. The Commonwealth is no longer, to put it mildly, a decisive linkage between nations. The Australia Act of 1986 formally defined Britain as a foreign country. Australia's economic links to Britain, though not insignificant, are small and dwindling in comparison with its trading ties to the near north, once known as the far east. Britain is in the EU and will act in accordance with its interests there, giving no priority to Australia. Australians who feel they are British because they speak English are fooling themselves but no one else. You can no longer \"be\" Australian and, without conflict, \"feel\" British. The two nations are too far apart. \u0095 A longer version of this article appears in this week's Time magazine.

      "bodyText": "Michelangelo's David, the jewel of Renaissance sculpture, was carved from a block of marble botched by Leonardo da Vinci, according to uncovered documents. It is thought Da Vinci tried to carve a massive statue of Hercules but failed and abandoned the block, which was given to the younger artist. Art historians have puzzled for centuries over who had been given first crack at the marble. A book of his charcoal sketches suggests he was originally commissioned to fill the space in front of Florence's Accademia gallery, said Carlo Pedretti, director of the Armand Hammer centre at the University of California. After a century in the hands of a French collector, the book was reportedly bought by a Swiss collector for \u00a31.3m at a recent Sotheby's auction. Florence's cathedral works committee is believed to have commissioned the Hercules around 1498 but for unknown reasons Da Vinci never completed it, probably because of a mistake. The 5m 17cm David, so alert it seems almost alive, has been hailed as a masterpiece and marvelled at by millions since Michelangelo finished it in 1504.",

      "bodyText": "The highly regarded Darwin, one of Aidan O'Brien's chief hopes for Classic honours next year, was found to be lame after finishing only sixth in yesterday's Group One National Stakes at the Curragh. Darwin, the 4-9 favourite, was one of four runners in the nine-strong field from O'Brien's Ballydoyle yard, who still won the race with 10-1 shot Beckett. The change in the going overnight to nearing soft put the emphasis on stamina rather than speed in the seven-furlong contest and it was King's County who kept on for second place, three lengths behind the winner to give O'Brien a one-two in the race. Beckett earned a 20-1 quote from William Hill for the Sagitta 2,000 Guineas. \"Beckett has had a hard race but he is a handy horse that moves well and we should be able to get him ready early next spring,\" said O'Brien. Meanwhile, Honours List, a two-length second to Tobougg in the Prix de la Salamandre at Longchamp on Saturday, could be set for a return trip to France. O'Brien said: \"He could go back to Longchamp for the Grand Criterium (October 8) as Michael Kinane said the horse spooked just after the furlong marker yesterday, losing his momentum at a crucial stage of the Salamandre.\" Asked about Sagitta 2,000 Guineas favourite Hemingway, who was forced to miss the French Group One race because of a slight setback, O'Brien added: \"He had five days off but comes to hand quickly and could still go for the Dewhurst Stakes.\" Victorious trainer Mick Channon, who was forced to watch Tobougg's victory on a television monitor at Newbury after earlier arriving at Heathrow without his passport, said that he had felt for some time that the winner was the best horse he had ever trained. He may soon be forced to watch Tobougg from afar on a permanent basis, however, as the colt, now 14-1 with Hill's for the Guineas, will surely figure high on the Godolphin transfer list. James Fanshawe will decide at the weekend whether to aim Saturday's Irish St Leger winner Arctic Owl at the Melbourne Cup. His gelding looks potentially well treated with 8st 13lb to carry at Flemington on November 7 as he escapes a penalty for his length-and-a-half defeat of Yavana's Pace at the Curragh. Newmarket basks in the title headquarters of British racing but is in severe danger of harming its reputation permanently if continuing to make the sort of elementary mistakes made at both its courses this year. The \u00a316m Millennium Grandstand opened on the Rowley Mile course in the spring was castigated by the course's annual members for clearly favouring corporate customers who were given the bulk of the prime viewing slots. Many ordinary racegoers, whose view of the racing was much more restricted, were also unimpressed. Newmarket's prestigious midsummer meeting on the July course also came under fire when the results of races were clearly affected by a significant track bias. On Saturday, the inauguration of a new meeting back on the Rowley course with two races confined to pure Arab horses as the centrepiece was a predictable flop with the attendance described as \"disappointing\". Newmarket did show some foresight and innovation in appointing 28-year-old Lisa Rowe as its new managing director. She takes over in October but clearly has work to do if she is to steer Newmarket back on course. Horses drawn high in sprints have a major advantage when the ground rides soft at Kempton and the in-from Budelli (3.40), perfectly placed in stall 24, looks well worth a proper bet today.",

When someone presses a button, Billy sings \"Don't worry, be happy\", turning his head and opening his mouth to the music. It is one of several tricks which has made him a popular toy.

      "bodyText": "A Pakistani man who was passed over for a job in favour of an Indian man has been awarded almost \u00a325,000 in compensation for racial discrimination. Mohammed Sharief, 43, had been chosen as the best candidate for an adviser's post within Derby city council's equality unit. But just as he was about to be offered the job the council's then deputy leader, Mark Young, stepped in. An employment tribunal panel said Mr Young had been \"enraged\" by the initial choice of candidate. He was angry at not being consulted on the first interviews and felt the process was flawed. The panel said he was intent on satisfying the city's ethnic minority mix in the unit, which already had a Pakistani on its staff. Mr Sharief said his failure to get the job had affected his career and his standing in the community. \"When it became public, it became very hard for me to function in Derby.\" He added: \"People were always asking me why I didn't get the job. \"I only found out after I served some legal papers on the tribunal that I had been about to be offered it. \"As I understand it now, the assistant chief executive was on the verge of ringing me up when Mr Young stopped her. \"It was clearly political interference on his part. He had not made any promises that anybody was aware of, and for him to cite that was wrong.\" Giving evidence to the tribunal, Mr Young insisted that he had only stepped in because of a promise he had made to Derby's ethnic communities. He said he had assured local Pakistani, Indian and Afro-Caribbean leaders that independent observers would witness all interviews for key posts. But he admitted he failed to inform council officers or members about this pledge. He added: \"With hindsight, there should have been more communication.\" A spokesman for the council said that it believed that Mr Young had been \"acting in good faith and had been attempting to broaden and strengthen the recruitment process\". The tribunal ruled that by scrapping its initial process the authority racially discrim inated against a trio of Pakistani candidates. Mr Sharief, of Derby, was awarded \u00a319,815 for loss of earnings and \u00a35,000 for injury to his feelings. The other unsuccessful candidates, Mohammed Ayub, of Derby, and Mahoof Rashid, of Rotherham, received compensation of \u00a35,000 and \u00a32,000 respectively. Solicitor Kevin McFadden, who represented all three men, said: \"Race discrimination is not always obvious, and takes many subtle forms. \"More than sending out a message to other local authorities, I hope that the council learns a salutary lesson from this case.\" Mr Young stood down as deputy leader in May this year and now works for the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union.",

Kingfisher owns about 35% of LibertySurf with a similar stake owned by Europweb , the investment vehicle of Bernard Arnault, the French fashion magnate. Deutsche Bank is advising LibertySurf on its options and the company has been linked to Vivendi , the French communications group. G7 finance ministers will warn Opec about the dangers of high oil prices. The newspaper quoted Treasury sources as saying the warning would be issued when G7 leaders met in Prague next weekend. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, will push his fellow G7 finance ministers to send a tough message to oil producing nations at the meeting, the report said. The warning might include a threat by the US to release some of its strategic petroleum reserve on to the market to drive down prices. Sunday Telegraph Altodigital , the provider of internet services for small and medium-sized companies, has appointed WestLB Panmure to lead a stockmarket flotation of the company worth \u00a3400m. Altodigital, which includes GWR , the independent radio group, among its investors, expects to float on the London stockmarket in the first quarter of 2001. Trinity Mirror has hired Joe Sinyor, the head of Sony UK and former boss of the Dillons bookstore chain to run its main newspaper business, according to Telegraph. Mail on Sunday The departure of London Stock Exchange chief executive Gavin Casey has cleared the way for deals with US stock market Nasdaq and European bourses. Mr Casey was blocking the creation of a viable pan-European stock market, according to sources close to the affair. Observer Littlewoods , the catalogue and stores chain, has been hit by a severe sales slump which threatens a stock market flotation expected by the controlling Moores family. The problems, plus rock bottom staff morale, may fuel a rebellion against the board. Tony Blair's vision of turning the UK into the best country in the world for e-commerce has suffered a serious setback after a huge falling out between telecom firms and industry watchdog Oftel . Sunday Business Smiths Industries has been approached by TI Group as a possible buyer of its Dowty aerospace division for around \u00a3600m. The paper says there are no ongoing discussions but Smiths may table an offer at short notice. American aerospace combine BF Goodrich is said also to be in the running. The Sultan of Brunei has sacked Citibank as one of his government's fund managers in the aftermath of the Asian crisis and the sultan's dispute with his spendthrift brother, Prince Jefri. Citibank ran a $4bn invesment fund on behalf of the Brunei government.

Harmar was a pushy, self-made west midlander with a special talent for upsetting Old Etonian Tories with condescending advice.</p> <p>Too often, he reminded Harold Macmillan of his 1950 rebel motion advocating the building of 300,000 houses, a feat on which Macmillan had built his early reputation. Once prime minister, Supermac repaid Harmar by refusing to promote him beyond the rank of parliamentary secretary, making him resign from government in 1960.</p> <p>But, while he was not as clever as he believed, there was no malice in Harmar - Labour's MP-novelist Maurice Edelman tagged him an \"inoffensive Tory prole\". Nicholls asserted, \"I like to live dangerously,\" an apt description of his fingertip hold on Peterborough during eight close elections. When he turned up in the Commons after 1966's record-breaking tight vote - which he won by three after seven recounts - friend and foe held up three fingers in welcome.</p> <p>Born in Darlaston, Staffordshire, Nicholls was educated at the local council school, and Queen Mary's grammar school, Walsall. In 1930, he became an active young conservative, and the next year was founder-chairman of Darlaston unemployed workers council. By 1936, he was vice-chairman of the West Midlands Junior Imperialist League, having won several debating prizes, and, in 1938, joined Darlaston district council.</p> <p>He had also made his first job move after serving behind the counter of his father's wallpaper shop, by becoming articled as a surveyor. By 1939, he had his own firm of surveyors, and another of estate agents.</p> <p>Nicholls volunteered for the Royal Engineers, and was flown back from Burma to contest the 1945 election, against Sydney Silverman in Nelson and Colne. Defeated there, he contested the 1946 Preston byelection, but it was only in 1950 that he narrowly captured Peterborough by 144 votes. Unashamedly rightwing, he backed capital punishment and privatising mines. He soon established a reputation as an eager beaver, urging government- backed low deposits to encourage home ownership.</p> <p>As parliamentary secretary for agriculture from 1955, he made a poor start, and was moved sideways by Macmillan to the Ministry of Works in 1957. There he did sensible things, like transferring departments south of the Thames. But he did not make himself popular by gratuitous advice. When Peter Thorneycroft, Nigel Birch and Enoch Powell resigned after failing to get \u00a350m of public spending cut, he said, \"They all ought to have their heads knocked together.\"</p> <p>After his 1960 resignation, Nicholls paid more attention to his business interests, expanding into casinos, theatres, Radio Luxembourg and insurance. Above all, he was an early agitator for commercial television as chairman of the National Broadcasting Development Committee. Once he wandered into dodgy territory, becoming a director of conman Bernie Cornfeld's \u00a32,500m IOS (Investors Overseas Services), a crooked offshore mutual fund, which collapsed in 1970. He lost credibility, and his Commons seat, in October 1974 after advocating a coalition government, and was given a life peerage.</p> <p>His temporary political comeback as an MEP in 1979 did not suit his Eurosceptic soul; he was a pro-Commonwealth man who believed British people should continue to populate the white Commonwealth. He was not re-selected.</p> <p>In the Lords, he continued to play the role of a partisan cheeky-chappy, leading Labour's po-faced Europhile Lord (Michael) Stewart to complain that his interventions prevented Labour peers from making coherent contributions.

      "bodyText": "Cheery, flamboyant Lord Harmar-Nicholls, the former Conservative MP for Peterborough (1950-74) and MEP for Greater Manchester South (1979-84), who has died aged 87, had a Davey lamp on his coat of arms to show his pride in his father's origins as a miner. Harmar was a pushy, self-made west midlander with a special talent for upsetting Old Etonian Tories with condescending advice. Too often, he reminded Harold Macmillan of his 1950 rebel motion advocating the building of 300,000 houses, a feat on which Macmillan had built his early reputation. Once prime minister, Supermac repaid Harmar by refusing to promote him beyond the rank of parliamentary secretary, making him resign from government in 1960. But, while he was not as clever as he believed, there was no malice in Harmar - Labour's MP-novelist Maurice Edelman tagged him an \"inoffensive Tory prole\". Nicholls asserted, \"I like to live dangerously,\" an apt description of his fingertip hold on Peterborough during eight close elections. When he turned up in the Commons after 1966's record-breaking tight vote - which he won by three after seven recounts - friend and foe held up three fingers in welcome. Born in Darlaston, Staffordshire, Nicholls was educated at the local council school, and Queen Mary's grammar school, Walsall. In 1930, he became an active young conservative, and the next year was founder-chairman of Darlaston unemployed workers council. By 1936, he was vice-chairman of the West Midlands Junior Imperialist League, having won several debating prizes, and, in 1938, joined Darlaston district council. He had also made his first job move after serving behind the counter of his father's wallpaper shop, by becoming articled as a surveyor. By 1939, he had his own firm of surveyors, and another of estate agents. Nicholls volunteered for the Royal Engineers, and was flown back from Burma to contest the 1945 election, against Sydney Silverman in Nelson and Colne. Defeated there, he contested the 1946 Preston byelection, but it was only in 1950 that he narrowly captured Peterborough by 144 votes. Unashamedly rightwing, he backed capital punishment and privatising mines. He soon established a reputation as an eager beaver, urging government- backed low deposits to encourage home ownership. As parliamentary secretary for agriculture from 1955, he made a poor start, and was moved sideways by Macmillan to the Ministry of Works in 1957. There he did sensible things, like transferring departments south of the Thames. But he did not make himself popular by gratuitous advice. When Peter Thorneycroft, Nigel Birch and Enoch Powell resigned after failing to get \u00a350m of public spending cut, he said, \"They all ought to have their heads knocked together.\" After his 1960 resignation, Nicholls paid more attention to his business interests, expanding into casinos, theatres, Radio Luxembourg and insurance. Above all, he was an early agitator for commercial television as chairman of the National Broadcasting Development Committee. Once he wandered into dodgy territory, becoming a director of conman Bernie Cornfeld's \u00a32,500m IOS (Investors Overseas Services), a crooked offshore mutual fund, which collapsed in 1970. He lost credibility, and his Commons seat, in October 1974 after advocating a coalition government, and was given a life peerage. His temporary political comeback as an MEP in 1979 did not suit his Eurosceptic soul; he was a pro-Commonwealth man who believed British people should continue to populate the white Commonwealth. He was not re-selected. In the Lords, he continued to play the role of a partisan cheeky-chappy, leading Labour's po-faced Europhile Lord (Michael) Stewart to complain that his interventions prevented Labour peers from making coherent contributions. But Harmar-Nicholls could be serious, as when he helped defeat Mrs Thatcher over football identity cards. Or when he tried, in 1994, to improve licensing requirements for agencies recruiting entertainers for overseas, sometimes a cover for international pimping. He leaves his wife, Dorothy, whom he married in 1940, and two daughters, the younger of whom, Sue, plays Audrey Roberts in Coronation Street. \u0095 Harmar Harmar-Nicholls, Baron Harmar-Nicholls of Peterborough, politician, born November 1 1912; died September 15 2000",

Lib Dems are in coalition with Labour in Scotland, members of Blair cabinet committees and tacit electoral cooperators. Merger won't happen, not least because Tony Blair reconstructed his party as a highly disciplined outfit. As John Bartle of Essex University wryly observes, Millbank \"is hardly likely to cope well with the individualistic and quasi-anarchic Liberal Democrats\". What is more likely is \"Romsey plus\", after the Hampshire byelection earlier this year in which the Lib Dems won a safe Tory seat. Labour and the Lib Dems will go on selecting candidates in every constituency, but where the Lib Dem is performing strongly against the Tory, Labour's campaign will be \"nominal\".</p> <p>Why the charade is necessary is that Lib Dem voters are not at all on the left and the idea that they are voting, even indirectly, for Labour would put them off. The tactic undoubtedly worked in 1997, which may come to rank as the most successful tactical campaign any party has fought. In February 1974 - an election, incidentally, called to decide who ran the country - the Liberals (as they then were) won a fifth of all British votes cast. Jeremy Thorpe was invited to coalition talks with Ted Heath, but all those votes had secured him were 14 Commons seats. In 1997, despite getting 800,000 fewer votes than in 1992 and 16.8% of the total vote, Lib Dems more than doubled their tally of seats from 20 to 46. In 1992, in their \"heartland\" region of the south-west, they won six seats out of 48 with 31% of the vote. The same proportion in 1997 won 14 of the region's 51 seats.</p> <p>That is a tribute to Lib Dem campaigning. But it does not rescue them from the perennial question facing the third nag in a three-horse race: who is your main rival? Mr Kennedy has pronounced the Tories the enemy, Labour mere competitors. That conforms with the chart. (It comes, with other data in this article, from an unpublished paper by Andrew Russell, Ed Fieldhouse and Iain MacAllister of Manchester University.) Labour is now the second preference of around 65% of prospective Lib Dem voters. It is a turnaround. During the 80s their alternative vote was definitely Tory. As things stand, even the weakest form of \"electoral reform\" (which is not strictly speaking proportional representation) is the alternative vote or AV. This scheme benefits Lib Dems and Labour alike since for both their supporters the Tories are third choice.</p> <p>But Mr Kennedy cannot rely on his voters in anything like the same way as Tony Blair or William Hague. John Curtice of Strathclyde University once memorably called the Lib Dem vote fickle and incoherent. Lib Dem voters are not easy to distinguish beyond being Methodists - proportionately not many Catholics vote Lib Dem. Sociologists detect no consistent profile for Lib Dem voters: you cannot easily tell them apart by job, gender or age. They turn out to be remarkably similar to Tory voters in their middle-classness. In recent years then, the Lib Dems have pulled off a remarkable feat. The party has moved left but their voters still look like a natural constituency of the centre-right. This might, of course, be further evidence of the ineptitude of the Tory party in failing to keep to the middle ground. It is too early to tell what effect the fuel crisis may have on voting intention. A Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph on Friday - some of its data collected before the fuel famine - showed a slight gain in Lib Dem support since early August. During the crisis, Mr Kennedy hardly covered himself in glory, studiously refusing to commit himself on the picketing. For the conference his resounding call is to make the Lib Dems the party of non-politics. But as a natural home for swingers, perhaps equivocation is good tactics.</p> <p>In 1997, only 12% of voters labelled themselves as Lib Dems; such identification is consistently lower than the party's election showing. People switch to them, having fallen out of love with the others. Nearly two-thirds of the Lib Dem vote in 1997 came from \"new\" recruits.</p> <p>Until now it has been plausible for Lib Dems to hope they might gain at the next election on the Romsey principle. If the Tories make themselves more extreme, the Lib Dems pick up defectors. A swing of 5% away from the Tories towards the Lib Dems would bring 12 extra seats. But what if Tory support firms up? The only gains the Lib Dems could then make would be at Labour's expense. Here the analogy is with Liverpool and Sheffield, where abstainers and switchers secured significant municipal victories for the Lib Dems at Labour's expense. The electoral significance of such a switch depends on constituency arithmetic.</p> <p>The number of seats where Lib Dems ran closely second to Labour in 1997 were few. Charles Kennedy, like his predecessors, has to be Janus-faced with a vengeance, saying different things in Scotland, where his party shares power with Labour, and in the regions of England. Unfortunately, this week he is out in the open and the mystery that is the Lib Dem party runs the risk of being exposed.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

What is more likely is \"Romsey plus\", after the Hampshire byelection earlier this year in which the Lib Dems won a safe Tory seat. Labour and the Lib Dems will go on selecting candidates in every constituency, but where the Lib Dem is performing strongly against the Tory, Labour's campaign will be \"nominal\". Why the charade is necessary is that Lib Dem voters are not at all on the left and the idea that they are voting, even indirectly, for Labour would put them off. The tactic undoubtedly worked in 1997, which may come to rank as the most successful tactical campaign any party has fought. In February 1974 - an election, incidentally, called to decide who ran the country - the Liberals (as they then were) won a fifth of all British votes cast. Jeremy Thorpe was invited to coalition talks with Ted Heath, but all those votes had secured him were 14 Commons seats. In 1997, despite getting 800,000 fewer votes than in 1992 and 16.8% of the total vote, Lib Dems more than doubled their tally of seats from 20 to 46. In 1992, in their \"heartland\" region of the south-west, they won six seats out of 48 with 31% of the vote. The same proportion in 1997 won 14 of the region's 51 seats. That is a tribute to Lib Dem campaigning. But it does not rescue them from the perennial question facing the third nag in a three-horse race: who is your main rival? Mr Kennedy has pronounced the Tories the enemy, Labour mere competitors. That conforms with the chart. (It comes, with other data in this article, from an unpublished paper by Andrew Russell, Ed Fieldhouse and Iain MacAllister of Manchester University.) Labour is now the second preference of around 65% of prospective Lib Dem voters. It is a turnaround. During the 80s their alternative vote was definitely Tory. As things stand, even the weakest form of \"electoral reform\" (which is not strictly speaking proportional representation) is the alternative vote or AV. This scheme benefits Lib Dems and Labour alike since for both their supporters the Tories are third choice. But Mr Kennedy cannot rely on his voters in anything like the same way as Tony Blair or William Hague. John Curtice of Strathclyde University once memorably called the Lib Dem vote fickle and incoherent. Lib Dem voters are not easy to distinguish beyond being Methodists - proportionately not many Catholics vote Lib Dem. Sociologists detect no consistent profile for Lib Dem voters: you cannot easily tell them apart by job, gender or age. They turn out to be remarkably similar to Tory voters in their middle-classness. In recent years then, the Lib Dems have pulled off a remarkable feat. The party has moved left but their voters still look like a natural constituency of the centre-right. This might, of course, be further evidence of the ineptitude of the Tory party in failing to keep to the middle ground. It is too early to tell what effect the fuel crisis may have on voting intention. A Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph on Friday - some of its data collected before the fuel famine - showed a slight gain in Lib Dem support since early August. During the crisis, Mr Kennedy hardly covered himself in glory, studiously refusing to commit himself on the picketing. For the conference his resounding call is to make the Lib Dems the party of non-politics. But as a natural home for swingers, perhaps equivocation is good tactics. In 1997, only 12% of voters labelled themselves as Lib Dems; such identification is consistently lower than the party's election showing. People switch to them, having fallen out of love with the others. Nearly two-thirds of the Lib Dem vote in 1997 came from \"new\" recruits. Until now it has been plausible for Lib Dems to hope they might gain at the next election on the Romsey principle. If the Tories make themselves more extreme, the Lib Dems pick up defectors. A swing of 5% away from the Tories towards the Lib Dems would bring 12 extra seats. But what if Tory support firms up? The only gains the Lib Dems could then make would be at Labour's expense. Here the analogy is with Liverpool and Sheffield, where abstainers and switchers secured significant municipal victories for the Lib Dems at Labour's expense. The electoral significance of such a switch depends on constituency arithmetic. The number of seats where Lib Dems ran closely second to Labour in 1997 were few. Charles Kennedy, like his predecessors, has to be Janus-faced with a vengeance, saying different things in Scotland, where his party shares power with Labour, and in the regions of England. Unfortunately, this week he is out in the open and the mystery that is the Lib Dem party runs the risk of being exposed. david.walker@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The spectre of northern Italy breaking away from the south returned yesterday when the Lombardy region said it would hold a referendum on devolution which could lead to independence. In a move which stunned the government, the Northern League said it wanted to force the transfer of powers from the state to the wealthy region it controls. The government called the plan dangerous, unconstitutional and liable to spin out of control. The threat could also unravel the centre-right opposition, led by Silvio Berlusconi, which welcomed the Northern League into its coalition on the condition that it renounced separatism. A poll in yesterday's La Repubblica showed a coalition led by Mr Berlusconi, a former prime minister, and including the Northern League would defeat the centre-left government in the national elections which are due in the spring. Tentative government plans for fiscal devolution have come to nothing, allowing the League's leader, Umberto Bossi, to seize the initiative. Politicians in the relatively impoverished southern regions have begun forming alliances as the prospect of isolation looms. Lombardy, which will hold the referendum for control of the police, health, trade and education on the same day as the general election, is expected to be followed by Venetia and Piedmont, which have resented the south's drain on resources virtually since Italy was unified in 1861. \"There is unlikely to be blood on the streets - whatever the response, the vote can have no immediate legal effect,\" a political scientist at the American University of Rome, James Walston, said. \"But if the three biggest and richest regions of the north vote in favour of devolution, the political effect will be devastating. \"Bossi has tossed a verbal hand grenade into political discourse. This initiative could take on a momentum of its own.\" Mr Bossi's inconsistency about the level of autonomy he wants has rattled Italy since his party emerged in the early 1990s. Leaders of the government coalition condemned his ultimatum as an attack on the unity of the state. \"Regional referendums are objectionable from a legal point of view; they are outside the law,\" the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, said. By challenging Rome's legitimacy the referendums could unleash a crisis in Italy's democratic institutions, he said. But some in the government sensed a chance to attack the resurgent opposition, which seeks to contrast its discipline with the fractious centre-left. \"It is demagoguery which will boomerang on them,\" said Massimo Cacciari, who survived the left's hammering in Venezia in last April's regional election. The opposition hoped it had tamed the League's mercurial leader, but yesterday he led supporters in a ritual of carrying water from the Po river to the Venetian lagoon, a tradition he invented three years ago to rally support for his notional independent state \"Padania\". Mr Bossi insisted that he no longer wanted independence, but his coalition partners feared that he was already slipping the leash. His walkout caused the collapse of Mr Berlusconi's first government after seven months in 1994. In a relationship patched up this year, Mr Berlusconi promised to dole out limited autonomy in return for the League's votes, which he is thought to need to return to power.

Stephen Hetherington, chief executive of the Lowry, said he was happy to run his \"village economy\" on the banks of the Manchester ship canal in Salford without state support. In the first major regional contribution to the high/low art debate, he told the Guardian that arts subsidies had contributed to the British obsession with cultural definitions. He sided firmly with the populism of Lord Bragg, who last week denounced Sir John Drummond, John Tusa, and other defenders of high art as \"senior citizens of our official culture\". The Lowry, the \u00a3105m national millennium landmark project for the arts, opened in April and buys in all shows for its two auditoriums, producing no work itself. It was given a \u00a344.6m capital grant from the Arts Council of England but receives no revenue funding from the council, although many of the companies that appear there do. \"I feel far freer than I would if I had a large subsidy cheque coming in every year,\" said Mr Hetherington. \"That cheque comes with someone else's rulebook, philosophy and agenda.

Black success undervalued The black community is succeeding in a variety of professions such as politics, law, business, medicine and the media but greatly underestimates its contribution to the economy, a survey by the financial services company Western Union said yesterday. Scottish driving test successes Learner drivers in Scotland have a much higher chance of passing their tests than anywhere else, according to figures released yesterday by the driving standards agency. The Highland town of Kingussie had an average pass rate last year of 79.2% -nearly double the national 43.7%.

      "body": "<p>The soothsayers were back in business last week, this time casting their prophetic eyes over the future of our employment. Tomorrow's Work, the latest report into the future of the world of business, paints a picture of six-hour days, double pay and all the flexibility that an employee's heart desires. </p> <p>Following a survey of 1,500 workers and 150 companies, the report is confident in its predictions. Author Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, boldly claims that, by 2020, the nine-to-five rat race will be extinct and present levels of self-employment, commuting and technology use, as well as age and sex gaps, will have changed beyond recognition. </p> <p>\"The labour market in 2000 is far more traditional than perceived,\" says Leach. \"It is not dominated by part-time employment, flexible working, home-working, teleworking or portfolio workers. But by 2010, I think that's all going to be different. There's going to be huge sea-change in the labour market.\" He anticipates that, in 20 years' time, 20-25% of the workforce will be temporary workers and many more will be flexible, that 25% of people will no longer work in a traditional office and that 50% will work from home in some form. </p> <p>There remains, however, a temptation to mumble that we have heard it all before. The future of work and the benefits for workers have been championed frequently in the past, but to no avail. We all continue to trek to our offices on a daily basis because, as much as we moan about it, we know that working in-house is the most effective way of getting things done. Leach is all too aware of this scepticism, arguing that that is why his report forecasts the real changes to happen 20 years from now. </p> <p>\"What our survey showed was that around 20% of organisations think there's going to be massive organisational change within the next decade, and 60% think it's going to be significant. If they are already preparing for that, the changes won't be far behind.\" </p> <p>It is a position shared by Jeremy Myerson, director of the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. \"Nobody knows what it's going to be like exactly, but there are various things that we can predict,\" he says. \"For example, the demographics of the workplace are going to change. By 2020, more than 50% of Europe's adult population will be over 50, and there will be a relative shortage of young workers, so employers will have to have more age-friendly policies.\" </p> <p>He goes on to forecast a more feminised workplace, spread over a range of locations with miniaturised, fully portable technology. \"The current divisions at the moment between stuff you have on a hard screen, and stuff you carry around on paper will go. Instead there'll be display technology which involves electronic screens with all the character istics of paper. This is not over the horizon - this is all very close. This will all be current by 2020.\" </p> <p>Of course, no prognosis is complete without its doubters and Clare Lees, associate director of the Henley Centre, which forecasts work trends, is just one of these. \"The paperless office will never happen,\" she says. \"Not until we start changing habits in schools, where kids grow up writing and reading books, will we start changing our attitude to paper.\" Likewise, she is not convinced by the home-working habit. \"Right now, only 1% of the working population are formally contracted home-workers - it's hardly the mass market.\" </p> <p>Lees highlights instead the \"homing at work\" trend, where lengthening working hours encourage people to do home-shopping and internet surfing at the office. \"In some companies, that's been actively encouraged, because if they're expecting people to work long hours it's a bit of a trade-off,\" says Lees. \"Giving people that flexibility is kind of a treat, but since more than 52% of working adults say they do some kind of homing at work, it's reasonable to say that if you didn't offer that, people would just walk.\" </p> <p>One of the business benefits of flexible working, of course, is that the costs of equipment, phone calls and computer use are all lessened by the presence of fewer full-timers in the office. It's a trade-off Barbara Narkiewicz is willing to accept, having gained more from her job since she started her flexible three-day week contract with Kelly Services recruitment company. \"Hooked to my ISDN line at home, I can be very productive over a short space of time,\" she says. \"I don't get distracted and I don't have to commute every day.\" Her decision to work from home was taken because she felt she wanted more leisure time for other things: \"I just wanted to fulfil other ambitions that weren't work related.\" </p> <p>In line with Leach's report, Narkiewicz is convinced that a growing appreciation of leisure time will see more workers following her initiative: \"I feel a lot of people want to do a similar thing. More and more people will start to work like this.\" </p> <p>Lucy Cox, an office manager and receptionist with GCI Jane Howard, has been job-sharing for a year. As a single mother, the appeal of shorter working hours is that they allow her to spend more time with her son. \"A lot of mothers I know are in a similar position. They don't want to be stuck in a domestic situation. They want to mix with adults and bring some money home, but they don't want to feel that they're constantly fighting a battle to meet their children at the correct time. I can see it happening more and more.\" </p> <p>Her desire to \"mix with adults\" is one that will ensure the office situation will survive in whatever form. Home-working can be a lonely business and one which not everyone would voluntarily embrace. As Leach himself admits: \"There's a fear of being outside the loop, of being seen as not working. It's very difficult to imagine those pressures will disappear. Assuming they continue, then so will the office environment.\" </p> <p>\"There will always be workplaces,\" says Myerson, \"because you need a sort of intense interactive experience.\" Leach agrees that \"the reason you'll go to an office in the future is not to process information or to do private considerative work, but to meet other people. The office of the future will be much more of a social landscape.\" Even dissenter Lees is ready to concede that we could end up in \"the ridiculous situation where you're doing all your work at home but having to go into work to socialise.\" </p> <p>Leach is keen to stress that flexible working doesn't necessarily mean working from home. \"Work will be done anywhere the laptop can be plugged in or connected to the office. We are still saying that the overwhelming majority of employees will work in an office environment but it will change. The key thing is that it will be a change the workforce generally feels positive about, as opposed to it being forced on us, and taken as the price of globalisation and economic competition.\" </p> <p>Cox is testament to that positivity and has no fears for what the future holds. \"I think with what I do - running an office - even if people do work more from home or on the mobile, you've still got offices that need to be staffed. There's still a job there. It's definitely not the end to work as we know it.\"</p>",

Yes, that one. Her counter-cultural kudos was quickly abandoned in the 80s, with acting roles in Down And Out In Beverly Hills (1986) and Ruthless People (1986). She played foul-mouthed, obnoxious, spoilt wives in both. Midler continued an undistinguished film career with the likes of For The Boys (1991) and The First Wives Club (1996), but now, like that other fallen starlet Cybill Shepherd, Midler's got her own sitcom, Bette!

      "bodyText": "Bette Midler in The Rose (Mark Rydell, 1979) Who? A foul-mouthed, obnoxious diva, Midler began her singing career in the 70s, playing in gay bathhouses accompanied by pianist Barry Manilow. Yes, that one. Her counter-cultural kudos was quickly abandoned in the 80s, with acting roles in Down And Out In Beverly Hills (1986) and Ruthless People (1986). She played foul-mouthed, obnoxious, spoilt wives in both. Midler continued an undistinguished film career with the likes of For The Boys (1991) and The First Wives Club (1996), but now, like that other fallen starlet Cybill Shepherd, Midler's got her own sitcom, Bette! (note the exclamation mark, an obvious guarantee of quality). The role: Janis Joplin. Oh, sorry, no, that's Rose - the foul-mouthed, obnoxious singer, whose life's a whirlwind of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. And who therefore bears no resemblance to Janis Joplin at all. Best Line: On stage at a stadium show, she breaks between songs to tell the audience: \"People say to me 'Rose, when was the first time you heard the blues?' And I tell them 'On the day I was born...\" Cringe factor: Low. Her acting and singing are of a pretty high standard, and the rock-chick look is definitely a good one for her. In fact, the most striking thing is how much she resembles a pre-Versace Courtney Love. Other wannabes: A youthful (well, 53-year-old) Harry Dean Stanton. Critical judgement: Leonard Maltin says the film \"equates showbiz with hell, then concentrates on giving the audience too much of the latter.\" Also not starring in: Scarecrow In A Garden Of Cucumbers, alongside Warhol superstar (and drag queen) Holly Woodlawn in 1971, and providing the voice for Woody The Spoon in the 1976 TV show Vegetable Soup.

Williams has adapted Dibdin's novel for a two-part drama: Dirty Tricks (Sunday, 9pm, ITV). Martin Clunes plays an amoral schemer who kills his mistress's husband and then plans to murder her for the insurance money. </p> <p>Until now, Dibdin - a 53-year-old Ulsterman now living in Seattle - has been unusually unlucky with television. Best known for his series of crime novels about the Italian policeman Aurelio Zen, he has watched as almost every other bestselling crimewriter - PD James, Ruth Rendell, Colin Dexter, Reginald Hill, Ian Rankin, Frances Fyfield, Minette Walters - has been given the sales and publicity push provided by television. Only Dibdin remained caged on the page. </p> <p>The difficulty seems to have been that detective series on our television are regarded as an English or Scottish form. A Zen series calls for Italian filming (with the added difficulty that each novel is set in a different region) and the possibility of Italian actors - which, in British television, brings memories of the notorious Borgias - although, for a long time, the fine Anglo-Italian actor Alfred Molina was mooted. But the project seems always to have been halted by the Euro-scepticism of drama commissioners: British stories for British people. </p> <p>So it's revealing that the first Dibdin to reach the screen comes from the fraction of his output set in contemporary England and, furthermore, is a novel set in the north Oxford of Inspector Morse. Dirty Tricks even contains an in-joke in which the uxoricidal character is investigated by an Inspector Moss of Thames Valley CID, who drives a vintage car and has an obsession with real beer and Donizetti. Perhaps it was this jokey shadow of television drama which allowed executives finally to see Dibdin's fiction as suitable for the screen. </p> <p>The television Dirty Tricks is directed by Paul Seed, who previously visualised House Of Cards and To Play The King. Even viewers who never read credits will soon make the link, because Clunes as the would-be wife-killer delivers soliloquies directly to camera - narrating the story in flashbacks as he dashes to Heathrow to flee to South America - in the style pioneered by Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart. </p> <p>This trick is the weakest part of the drama, not only because it's now a second-hand device, but because it feels less logical than in the other series. Urquhart was a consciously Shakesperean figure - Richard III as PM - and politicians have a convention of speaking directly to the viewer in ministerial broadcasts. A poverty-stricken language teacher, Edward lacks either association. Seed does, though, bring other lovely touches. The murdered husband Dennis (Neil Dudgeon) was a wine bore and the coffin at his funeral is topped with bunches of grapes rather than flowers. </p> <p>But the most intriguing parts of this dark yet jaunty drama are the sex scenes. As a novel, Dirty Tricks was not only sexually explicit but specific. Edward's affair begins when a north Oxford hostess he hardly knows gives him fellatio in the kitchen after a dinner party. She has signalled her interest to Edward by surreptitiously masturbating to orgasm on the sofa while her husband's back is turned. The lovers' desperation for each other is illustrated by couplings including sex in the shower and cunnilingus during menstruation. It later becomes significant that Edward is faking his orgasms. </p> <p>Although you wouldn't have given the book to your aunt for Christmas, this level of erotic detail is conventional in post-Chatterley novels. But television drama - though sexually obsessed - is rarely sexually adventurous. Most sex on television is missionary position thrusting which leads rapidly to double coming, although female characters identified by the dialogue as feminists are usually allowed a spell on top. Since the 90s, oral sex has been alluded to in that now familiar scene in which one head suddenly slides south out of shot until the head still visible snaps back against the pillow. Detailed attention to who is doing what to who is usually found only in gay dramas such as Queer As Folk. </p> <p>But, surprisingly, Dirty Tricks acts out most of the acts Dibdin describes - including Karen (Julie Graham) fingering herself on the settee, and even warning her lover that her period has come - and will have puritanical viewers staining their sheets of Basildon Bond with outraged ink. This must be the sauciest story ever screened in ITV peak-time. </p> <p>The sex, though, is never gratuitous. The subject of the story is lust - for sex, money and power over others - and, in Dirty Tricks, for almost the first time in television drama, sex acts advance the story rather than punctuate it to pump up the ratings.

      "body": "<p>When Bernard the paedophile gets a toilet thrown through his front window in <strong> My Fragile Heart</strong> (ITV, Sunday), you know things are getting really nasty. Not that things weren't unpleasant before. Adultery on a bed of sofa cushions, burgeoning teenage sexuality in the woods and a shortage of ice in the home of Trina's alcoholic mum (she took to using frozen peas instead), these are not recognisable traits of cosy Sunday night drama. (Indeed, the closest Heartbeat got to anything as disturbing as this was when Charlotte Church pitched up at Yuletide, as welcome as the Grinch who stole Christmas). </p> <p>The adultery and frozen peas were only tangentially linked to the toilet (unplumbed) in Bernard's living room, since its presence was due to the murder of a young girl. Shannon, as typical a 12-year-old as you'd find, was found dead, and perhaps sexually assaulted, in circumstances alarmingly similar to a crime of which Bernard was found guilty some 15 years ago. Only Bernard's conviction was a miscarriage of justice and he hadn't done it at all, but such a minor detail didn't stop most people leaping to the conclusion that he had struck again. Hence the toilet, a tense chase through battalions of pristine toilets fresh off the production line in the factory where he worked and, predictably, a crowd of banner-waving protestors outside the police station where he was being held.

      "bodyText": "When Bernard the paedophile gets a toilet thrown through his front window in My Fragile Heart (ITV, Sunday), you know things are getting really nasty. Not that things weren't unpleasant before. Adultery on a bed of sofa cushions, burgeoning teenage sexuality in the woods and a shortage of ice in the home of Trina's alcoholic mum (she took to using frozen peas instead), these are not recognisable traits of cosy Sunday night drama. (Indeed, the closest Heartbeat got to anything as disturbing as this was when Charlotte Church pitched up at Yuletide, as welcome as the Grinch who stole Christmas). The adultery and frozen peas were only tangentially linked to the toilet (unplumbed) in Bernard's living room, since its presence was due to the murder of a young girl. Shannon, as typical a 12-year-old as you'd find, was found dead, and perhaps sexually assaulted, in circumstances alarmingly similar to a crime of which Bernard was found guilty some 15 years ago. Only Bernard's conviction was a miscarriage of justice and he hadn't done it at all, but such a minor detail didn't stop most people leaping to the conclusion that he had struck again. Hence the toilet, a tense chase through battalions of pristine toilets fresh off the production line in the factory where he worked and, predictably, a crowd of banner-waving protestors outside the police station where he was being held. All of which made My Fragile Heart both topical and, more importantly, excellent drama. Only Trina wasn't convinced he had murdered Shannon, and that might have had something to do with the fact that Trina was played by Sarah Lancashire. Leading this exemplary cast, which included Lorcan Cranitch as Bernard and a flurry of actors more famous for appearing in Brookside, Hollyoaks and Coronation Street, Lancashire was incandescent as ever.

      "body": "<p>Nick Grimshaw leans back in his chair, afternoon sun glinting on his spectacles, admiring his new office. The architect has had the builders in for five months, extending his practice's headquarters in London's West End to accommodate a staff of 120. His desk now faces a 30ft glass wall, overlooking a floor packed end to end with architects. </p> <p>\"We are going to have a map of the world etched on the glass, with markers for all our projects,\" he says, unabashed. The highlights will include an art gallery in Spain, an extension to Zurich airport, a landmark bridge in the Netherlands and a \u00a327m Plant Science Centre in St Louis, Missouri. </p> <p>Grimshaw, 60, may be one of the leading high-tech architects, but he is not usually the flamboyant sort. \"Some people want to have a high profile and involve themselves in public life,\" he says. 'That's up to them. I prefer to let my buildings speak for themselves.\" </p> <p>Grimshaw is one of the four big architects of the 1960s generation, alongside Lords Rogers and Foster and Sir Michael Hopkins, and the only one still a plain Mr. That doesn't bother him, he says. \"I don't think one could say it was central to one's operation as an architect. We are not one person; we are a firm. I think there is a sense of pride that one gets as a firm from being recognised, but I think it is neither here nor there, really.\" </p> <p>He recently gained another kind of recognition when he won the contract to handle the \u00a3500m redevelopment of Battersea Power Station. Grimshaw's scheme, approved by Wandsworth council last month, will see the derelict power station converted into a complex of 650 luxury flats, offices, exhibition areas, theatre space, cinemas, a hotel and restaurants. Grimshaw is riveted by the scale of the project. </p> <p>Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners has come a long way from the low-cost industrial enclosures that made its name, but Grimshaw has remained true to the principles of high tech. He concentrates on the intricacies of a building, combining architecture with product design to flaunt the structural components. \"I am very keen on the industrial design side of life,\" he says. </p> <p>A new exhibition of the practice's work between 1993 and 2000, called Equilibrium, has just opened at the Design Museum in London. The show's notes proclaim the group's emphasis on \"structural finesse, sustainability and the employment of new technology\". Grimshaw has an idiosyncratic image of his work. \"I am very keen on boats. I want my buildings to have the feel of a fine yacht. It is to do with the longevity of the brand, quality of the detailing - never a nasty finish on anything.\" </p> <p>Grimshaw's team has produced a number of elegant structures, as Equilibrium shows. There are the asymmetrical tubular steel arches of Waterloo International, the snaking elegance of the Ijburg Bridge between Ijmeer Lake and Amsterdam, and the Caixa Galicia gallery in La Coruna, Spain, whose sloping metal-clad facade has been described as \"a wave rolled up on the harbour front\". </p> <p>Yet for all their beauty, Grimshaw's buildings have often been accused of harbouring technical flaws. The ship-shaped \u00a333.5m Western Morning News headquarters in Plymouth, for example, completed in 1993, features south-facing window walls that cause glare on the journalists' screens. \"We planted a row of trees,\" insists Grimshaw. \"They just had to grow a bit. We had [also] designed sail-like blinds that the users could control, to create shade, but they had not wanted to buy them until they had seen how the building worked.\" </p> <p>When Waterloo International was finished in 1992, it was feted as a symbol of 21st-century pan-European travel. But last year some panels in the glazed canopy started to crack and fall on to the platforms below. Critics claimed that it symbolised the risks inherent in pushing technology to its limits. </p> <p>Grimshaw bristles at criticism of Waterloo, and insists that the problems were not in the design. \"No one is suggesting that an architect in 1988 should not have specified toughened glass. There is not an architect in the country who hasn't specified toughened glass in some situation or another who would not be affected by nickel sulphide.\" The reference is to an impurity that can appear in the glass during the toughening process. Mediation has just started and Grimshaw expects to be vindicated on this point. \"The role of testing and technical experts has certainly increased. You can only take the best advice you can and do what they say.\" </p> <p>What about reports of impact damage? Grimshaw confirms that there was some near a local pub, conjuring up images of bottles flying overhead. Reports of a deer leg hitting the roof are also true. \"They thought a hawk might have been carrying it,\" says Grimshaw. Despite the surreal humour of these findings, the fault did no good to the firm's reputation. </p> <p>The projects completed since have been well received, however, including the \u00a340m first phase of the remodelling of Paddington Station, with its state-of-the-art flat-screen signage and furniture developed by the firm's product design arm. Then there is the \u00a376m Eden Project, with its delicate geodesic domes encasing tropical foliage sited in a Cornish claypit, which has enchanted the public, and the \u00a390m spa in Bath, with its rooftop pool. This has been hailed by English Heritage as an example of the symbiosis between conservation and modern architecture. </p> <p>Proof that Grimshaw's reputation had weathered the storm over Waterloo came in May, when he won two major projects in a fortnight: the \u00a315m extension of the Royal College of Art, and the Battersea Power Station redevelopment, for Hong Kong developer Parkview </p> <p>Now it seems that Parkview president Victor Hwang wants as much of Grimshaw as he can get. Hwang wants to reassemble the facade, solar shading and water wall of Grimshaw's British Pavilion for the Seville Expo 1992 in the Battersea complex. He is understood to have made an offer to the Asian businessman who has the pavilion stored in containers and plans to use it as a venue for weddings. </p> <p>So what does Grimshaw think are the next big ideas in architecture? \"We have a long way to go on materials,\" he says. \"I have always been interested in buildings changing their skin, materials that can go dark or light or breathe. I think there is a lot of potential there. </p> <p>\"But also I think there is a lot of potential socially in buildings - that they can be much more user-friendly places. And the whole home/work idea: I'm quite keen on the idea of designing buildings that can be either residential or offices. Offices might be much more like residential buildings, with nice places to eat and sit around in.\" </p> <p>Having risen above the Waterloo problems, Grimshaw will continue to play the tricky game of architecture, fuelled by \"sheer joy in actually putting up buildings\". </p> <p>\u0095 Equilibrium is at the Design Museum, London SE1 (020-7940 8790), till October 8.

      "body": "<p>They stood shoulder to shoulder in Antrim shopping centre on Saturday. Just as well, because it cut out any chance of back stabbing. There were Lord Molyneaux, ex-Ulster Unionist party leader, consistently against the Good Friday agreement, the incumbent, David Trimble, still an avowed supporter, and Jeffrey Donaldson, long tipped as likely successor, and the most vociferous of all opponents of the deal. Add in the sceptics, and all hues of party opinion were there.</p> <p>It was a rare display of Ulster Unionist unity, as they posed in support of David Burnside, one of the party's more impressive performers. He is fighting to defend what should be a rock solid 16,500 majority in the South Antrim byelection on Thursday.</p> <p>Curtis Watson, five, rather spoiled the moment, savaging public relations guru Mr Burnside, 48, with his plastic claw. The laughs rang somewhat hollow.</p> <p><b> Critical</b><br></p> <p>For the result, due early on Friday, could scarcely be more critical. Aside from the small matter of Northern Ireland's future, Ulster Unionists' survival is at stake. The party is in panic.</p> <p>Mr Burnside is tough, British Airways' director of communications during its dirty tricks war with Virgin, and a former leading light, with Mr Trimble, of Vanguard, the hardline loyalist group. This, though, is his toughest fight, and he says the outcome is knife edge.</p> <p>For Mr Trimble, it is a lose-lose scenario. Defeat for Mr Burnside could spark a domino effect, come the general election, for how many of the party's seats, currently at 10, would be safe? Four, maybe, according to one of Mr Trimble's own assembly members.</p> <p>While victory for Mr Burnside might stave off an immediate challenge to Mr Trimble's leadership, it would shift the balance of opinion within the party even further away from the agreement, now 30 months old. Many insiders predict the new MP would be a more serious threat in the medium term to Mr Trimble than Mr Donaldson, and that, in turn, impacts on the new political system.</p> <p>Mr Burnside, one-time Trimble ally, reflects the shifting mood of party members. He backed the agreement with fingers crossed, but was opposed to returning to devolution in May after suspension.</p> <p>\"If Tony Blair had told me 30 months ago that all paramilitary prisoners would have been out without decommissioning; that political parties still linked to those capable of terrorist violence would be in government; and that the reform of policing did not, as the agreement says, require the support of the wider community, then I would have voted No.</p> <p>\"But there is no referendum tomorrow. What I will be working for is against those concessions, and the only party that is capable of representing Unionism is the Ulster Unionist party. This is more than a fight between supporters and opponents of the agreement, as the range of opinion backing me proves.\"</p> <p><b> Popular</b><br></p> <p>In other times, Mr Burnside would be a shoo-in: the mainly agricultural area has long been an Ulster Unionist stronghold, and Clifford Forsythe, while invisible on a wider stage, was a popular constituency MP, cantering home at every shout since 1983. His sudden death in April sparked Mr Trimble's byelection headache, despite bequeathing a 16,611 majority.</p> <p>But the Democratic Unionist party, a vociferous critic of the agreement, is no longer allowing Ulster Unionists a free-run. It is instead turning an otherwise meaningless poll into a referendum of the agreement, and Mr Trimble's stewardship of it.</p> <p>The DUP stands a fine chance. Votes for Unionist candidates opposed to the agreement at the referendum in May 1998 were evenly split, and the erosion of backing for it among the silent majority - middle class, moderate Protestants - is, it seems, stunning.</p> <p>The DUP's candidate is assembly member Willie McCrea, MP for Mid-Ulster until Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness humiliated him in May 1997, and the preacher and gospel singer is an adept doorstep campaigner. He shrugs off continuing controversy over his links to late loyalist leader Billy Wright, at whose funeral he officiated.</p> <p>His team, much more active on the doorsteps, is taking a populist approach. It is oozing confidence. There is traditionally a low turnout in South Antrim, and disenchanted Ulster Unionists are more disinclined to vote. That will benefit Mr McCrea, 52, with apathy Mr Burnside's greatest enemy. But the Ulster Unionist's message, too, is confused.</p> <p><b> Appeal</b><br></p> <p>Mr Burnside wants those who backed the agreement wholeheatedly to support him because Mr McCrea offers them nothing; those who voted for it and who are now sceptics, to look to him as he will best represent those worries; and he appeals to those who voted No \"honourably\" to place their X against his name. Hardly clear cut.</p> <p>Mr Burnside and Mr McCrea both believe they are battling for the soul of Unionism. Each says it is lost if the other wins.</p> <p>Mr Burnside says: \"Opposition politics is easy. You throw insults and blame somebody else for everything, from the morning rain to the housing crisis. Try and list me what the other party has ever done to protect and promote Unionism.\"</p> <p>But Mr McCrea, knocking on doors in Templepatrick, where the late MP lived, says: \"I want to galvanise the Unionist family. To vote for me is to vote to ditch the discredited agreement and to call a halt to the continual drip-drip feed of concessions to republicans.\"</p> <p>Other candidates are assembly member Donovan McClelland, 51, for the SDLP; ex-IRA man Martin Meehan, representing Sinn Fein, and David Ford, who sits in the assembly for the Alliance party.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They stood shoulder to shoulder in Antrim shopping centre on Saturday. Just as well, because it cut out any chance of back stabbing. There were Lord Molyneaux, ex-Ulster Unionist party leader, consistently against the Good Friday agreement, the incumbent, David Trimble, still an avowed supporter, and Jeffrey Donaldson, long tipped as likely successor, and the most vociferous of all opponents of the deal. Add in the sceptics, and all hues of party opinion were there. It was a rare display of Ulster Unionist unity, as they posed in support of David Burnside, one of the party's more impressive performers. He is fighting to defend what should be a rock solid 16,500 majority in the South Antrim byelection on Thursday. Curtis Watson, five, rather spoiled the moment, savaging public relations guru Mr Burnside, 48, with his plastic claw. The laughs rang somewhat hollow. Critical For the result, due early on Friday, could scarcely be more critical. Aside from the small matter of Northern Ireland's future, Ulster Unionists' survival is at stake. The party is in panic. Mr Burnside is tough, British Airways' director of communications during its dirty tricks war with Virgin, and a former leading light, with Mr Trimble, of Vanguard, the hardline loyalist group. This, though, is his toughest fight, and he says the outcome is knife edge. For Mr Trimble, it is a lose-lose scenario. Defeat for Mr Burnside could spark a domino effect, come the general election, for how many of the party's seats, currently at 10, would be safe? Four, maybe, according to one of Mr Trimble's own assembly members. While victory for Mr Burnside might stave off an immediate challenge to Mr Trimble's leadership, it would shift the balance of opinion within the party even further away from the agreement, now 30 months old. Many insiders predict the new MP would be a more serious threat in the medium term to Mr Trimble than Mr Donaldson, and that, in turn, impacts on the new political system. Mr Burnside, one-time Trimble ally, reflects the shifting mood of party members. He backed the agreement with fingers crossed, but was opposed to returning to devolution in May after suspension. \"If Tony Blair had told me 30 months ago that all paramilitary prisoners would have been out without decommissioning; that political parties still linked to those capable of terrorist violence would be in government; and that the reform of policing did not, as the agreement says, require the support of the wider community, then I would have voted No. \"But there is no referendum tomorrow. What I will be working for is against those concessions, and the only party that is capable of representing Unionism is the Ulster Unionist party. This is more than a fight between supporters and opponents of the agreement, as the range of opinion backing me proves.\" Popular In other times, Mr Burnside would be a shoo-in: the mainly agricultural area has long been an Ulster Unionist stronghold, and Clifford Forsythe, while invisible on a wider stage, was a popular constituency MP, cantering home at every shout since 1983. His sudden death in April sparked Mr Trimble's byelection headache, despite bequeathing a 16,611 majority. But the Democratic Unionist party, a vociferous critic of the agreement, is no longer allowing Ulster Unionists a free-run. It is instead turning an otherwise meaningless poll into a referendum of the agreement, and Mr Trimble's stewardship of it. The DUP stands a fine chance. Votes for Unionist candidates opposed to the agreement at the referendum in May 1998 were evenly split, and the erosion of backing for it among the silent majority - middle class, moderate Protestants - is, it seems, stunning. The DUP's candidate is assembly member Willie McCrea, MP for Mid-Ulster until Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness humiliated him in May 1997, and the preacher and gospel singer is an adept doorstep campaigner. He shrugs off continuing controversy over his links to late loyalist leader Billy Wright, at whose funeral he officiated. His team, much more active on the doorsteps, is taking a populist approach. It is oozing confidence. There is traditionally a low turnout in South Antrim, and disenchanted Ulster Unionists are more disinclined to vote. That will benefit Mr McCrea, 52, with apathy Mr Burnside's greatest enemy. But the Ulster Unionist's message, too, is confused. Appeal Mr Burnside wants those who backed the agreement wholeheatedly to support him because Mr McCrea offers them nothing; those who voted for it and who are now sceptics, to look to him as he will best represent those worries; and he appeals to those who voted No \"honourably\" to place their X against his name. Hardly clear cut. Mr Burnside and Mr McCrea both believe they are battling for the soul of Unionism. Each says it is lost if the other wins. Mr Burnside says: \"Opposition politics is easy. You throw insults and blame somebody else for everything, from the morning rain to the housing crisis. Try and list me what the other party has ever done to protect and promote Unionism.\" But Mr McCrea, knocking on doors in Templepatrick, where the late MP lived, says: \"I want to galvanise the Unionist family. To vote for me is to vote to ditch the discredited agreement and to call a halt to the continual drip-drip feed of concessions to republicans.\" Other candidates are assembly member Donovan McClelland, 51, for the SDLP; ex-IRA man Martin Meehan, representing Sinn Fein, and David Ford, who sits in the assembly for the Alliance party.",

So the comedian would be alarmed to learn that unless women take to sinking pints of beer, some of men's favourite ales could be under threat. A leading beer writer has claimed that Britain's declining real ale industry could be in trouble unless it tempts women drinkers away from white wine and gin and tonic and encourages them to try traditional cask beer. Writing in the 2001 Good Beer Guide, published today, Lynne Pearce argues that the majority of brewers persist in making and marketing beers with male consumers in mind. While increasing numbers of women are going to pubs, she argues, \"the local is still perceived as a predominantly male domain, where the female of the species is tolerated only if she is pulling your pint\". In the face of aggressive competition from designer bottled beers, draught lagers and alcopops, Ms Pearce believes it is time that the declining ale industry finds new drinkers beyond its traditional markets. \"Women are definitely being sidelined by brewers,\" she said yesterday. \"But by continually marketing at men they are targeting a group that has essentially peaked.\" More than half of women visit bars regularly, compared to 23% in 1994, and the proportion drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week has risen from 10% to 15%.

The crew advised Captain Clapson that take-off should be abandoned, and he took the plane back to the stand. He then tried but failed to reason with the woman. He ordered her off the plane, having called the police. The aircraft took off without her. Balpa said no complaint was received from the other passengers, but BA managers ruled that Captain Clapson had been \"rude and abusive\". He was initially demoted, but when Balpa took up his case he was dismissed. Mike Sparham, Balpa's assistant general secretary, said: \"Captain Clapson had to be firm with the passenger. He needed to act to discover that her accusations were groundless and to calm the situation. He did his best for the company and for the passengers. BA should be supporting him, not sacking him. \"We are deeply concerned at the way the appeals procedure is being ignored. If you appeal, your punishment will be increased. We can't have that.\" This is the first time that a pilot has been dismissed for acting to curb an \"air rage\" incident. Balpa has referred the issue to an employment tribunal, which is to hear the case this week. BA last night confirmed that an incident had taken place but said it could not comment further because it might prejudice the tribunal's findings.",

The army chief of staff, General Angelo Reyes, said that - contrary to reports on Saturday that many of the captives had been killed - he believed they were still alive and well. But he admitted that his troops were making slow progress against the Abu Sayyaf rebels and added that the operation, which was ordered by President Joseph Estrada in the early hours of Saturday, might last a week. \"All the hostages, based on reports, are alive,\" he said in Zamboanga City, the headquarters for the assault, after briefing Mr Estrada and members of his cabinet who had flown from Manila, 600 miles to the north. \"There have been no reports from the field to indicate that any have been casualties.\" Gen Reyes said six rebels were killed and 20 captured. Four soldiers were wounded. His officers had told him that the gang members were in \"escape mode\". \"The fact is that [the rebels] are fleeing and they have not left any hostages as casualties.\" President Estrada ordered the attack after successive kidnappings in the past five months by the Abu Sayyaf group, whose members style themselves Islamic fighters but seem chiefly interested in making ransom money. Their hostages are 13 Filipinos, three Malaysians, a US citizen and two French television journalists. Another military source was reported as saying that the army was not attacking camps where it believed the hostages might be. \"We are being very precise in our target selection.

As more than 500,000 troops maintaining the 10th ceasefire between the two countries, the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, is accusing Eritrea of holding 30,000 Ethiopians in slave labour camps. In response to his accusation, the Guardian was allowed to go to Ala camp, where 2,500 Ethiopian civilian men have been interned since a civilian repatriation agreement between the two countries broke down in July. It is a miserable place, a rocky, sun-roasted hillside half an hour's walk from the only trickle of water for miles; but the rations are the same as those given to war-displaced Eritreans, the internees seem on friendly terms with their guards, and there is no labour of any kind. The Eritrean government says that 14,000 of its 80,000 Ethiopian residents were interned after Ethiopia's incursion into the country in May, in order, it says, to protect them from an irate population. There are no walls round the camp and only a handful of guards: it is 30 miles of semi-desert from the nearest road, and a forbidding place to run from. The camp offers almost no protection against the scorching sun and chilly nights. Plastic sheeting was brought in by the Red Cross last week after most of the internees had spent more than three months seeking shade under miserable cactus shelters and huddling together in their sleep. \"When can we leave this place?\" Getachew Tecle asked me. \"There is no medicine and many people have sunstroke and diarrhoea.

John-Paul Jacquod, head of the ICRC delegation in Asmara, said: \"There are two Ethiopian internment camps in Eritrea and we have full access to them both. \"Eritrea's signing of the convention was an important historical step which is allowing the ICRC to carry out its responsibilities.\" He believed that Eritrea was reluctant to give access to the camps in part because, at a time when more than a million of its people were displaced by the Ethiopian offensive, it was unable to provide the basic food and shelter international law demands. \"The ICRC can understand that it may be difficult for a government to provide internees with food and shelter that are unavailable to its own displaced nationals, but it must realise that these are things which we will supply,\" he said. The ICRC's presence should reassure the international community and deflate some of the propaganda coming from both sides of the conflict - the Eritrean president, Issais Afworki, accuses Ethiopia of \"detaining and torturing thousands of innocent Eritrean civilians in concentration camps in Ethiopia\". But the issue will linger on until both governments agree to resume the repatriation programme. As the UN's first military ob servers are deployed along the 600-mile frontline, resuming repatriation would be a big boost to the peace process. The continuing accusations about the internment camps looks to many analysts like a possible pretext for war.",

      "bodyText": "The Burmese National League for Democracy announced yesterday that it is to risk its future by drafting a new constitution for the country, in defiance of the military junta. The NDL's decision, taken at a meeting of 200 members on Saturday, comes as the authorities increase the pressure on the party and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. A former party member wrote in a government-backed newspaper yesterday that the party should be dissolved immediately before it and Ms Suu Kyi \"get too daring\". At the meeting, held to commemorate the second anniversary of the NLD's proxy parliament, delegates agreed to ask a committee to draw up a new constitution. The parliament was formed for those who won seats in the 1990 general election. The NLD won th election by a landslide, but has never been allowed to govern. The meeting called on the military authorities to convene a parliament immediately and release all Burma's political prisoners. Many of the people who won seats in 1990 are detained. Burma's generals seized power in 1962. The current junta annulled the constitution when it took control in 1998. Four years ago it passed a law stipulating the imprisonment of anyone attempting to write a new constitution, and the banning of his or her organisation. The NLD decision was taken two days after Ms Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and eight party colleagues were released from two weeks' house arrest. They were restrained after Ms Suu Kyi and several party members were forcibly returned to the capital, Rangoon, after a nine-day stand-off with the authorities on a road out of the city. They had been trying to go to a party meeting in the provinces. Senior party members said that 11 more members had been placed under house arrest on Friday, a sign that the government is not going to ease its oppression of democratic forces. This was confirmed yesterday when the newspaper Myanma Ahlin printed an attack on the NLD by one of its former members, Hla Soe. \"There is almost no political party in Myanmar [the generals' name for Burma] history which is as mean and evil as the NLD and Suu Kyi,\" he wrote. \"The government has tolerated the NLD for so many years, but it is time the party is completely eliminated.\" He added: \"It is time the government takes care of the problem according to the law. If the problem is taken lightly, the Americans, the British and Suu Kyi will become more daring and the country will suffer more.\"",

After her abrupt departure from the Cond* Nast group, the former editor of Tatler not only fell victim to that old \"did-she-jump-or-was-she-pushed?\" whispering campaign, but also suffered a series of articles documenting her abrasive professional style, including one so harsh it prompted her to take legal action against the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p> It would be enough to make any high-profile editor skulk in the shadows before contemplating her next move. But not Proctor. She turned around and gave the chatterboxes something to talk about by masterminding a website largely dedicated to - you guessed it - gossiping. Procter is now editorial director of <a href=\"http://www.PeopleNews.com\"> PeopleNews.com</a>, a project that also has the support of ex-Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil and goes live on the web today.</p> <p> Celebrity gossip is the shorthand description, but the behind-the-scenes brains will have you know it's more that that. There's gossip, news, views, pictures, lists and games. There's information on how to achieve that look, make that meal, buy that dress. And there are parties. Lots of parties. Last night's parties, parties of the year, last week in London, this week with Vivienne Westwood and all the juice about Herm*s at Shoreditch.</p> <p> A visit to their offices is enough to confirm that this is the most well-connected website staff on the net. As soon as I arrive, in walks Simon Walker, director of business development, grumbling about the sudden outburst of rain: \"Just my luck the weather turns now. I'm supposed to be going to a party at Babington House in the country tonight.\" </p> <p> With Procter at its helm and all this socialising documented between its walls, it is tempting to label PeopleNews.com as the online Tatler. Catherine Ostler, UK editor of the site, also had a stint at the magazine, but is keen to ensure this new project is not seen as society gossip going cyber. \"Everyone knows it would be suicidal to go down that route on the net,\" says Ostler. \"We're absolutely not for the old-fashioned Tatler and Harpers &amp; Queen-type people. These parties aren't Lord and Lady Posh. They're people on telly and we all want to know what they're up to.\" Walker will have you believe that with our insatiable desire for gossip, PeopleNews.com is onto a winner. \"We're creating a new genre,\" he says, boldly, \"the genre of people news. This is the really interesting media story of our time, the fact that people just love this kind of stuff. We reckon that with all the TV, magazines, newspapers and chatting, people spend over an hour a day doing stuff that is people news. It's gossip, it's people-based lifestyle news, it's entertainment news and it's fun.\" </p> <p> So far, so non-society. But aren't we now venturing into the realms of tabloid journalism, with all this talk of who wore what where? \"All the newspapers are putting those sorts of things on front pages now,\" says Walker, \"they used to be diary columns at the back but now they're all over the cover of the Daily Telegraph.\" Yet this is no broadsheet dumb-down exercise either. The People News brand is a specific one: avoiding the hagiography of Hello! and OK!, whilst sidestepping the \"people are cannon-fodder\" attitude of the tabloid world. \"We'll have a sort of meritocratic coverage. Society magazines are elite in the wrong way. We're elitist in that we want the best people on our site. For example, we'll be working with Julian MacDonald around fashion week. He's a PeopleNews person. Totally on-brand.\" </p> <p> What is and what isn't \"on-brand\" for PeopleNews is fundamental to the success of the site. Not only is the class of the content essential for attracting the right audience, but it also holds the financial key to the entire project. Walker argues there is a whole group of advertisers out there who have yet to get started on the net because they can't find the right site to spend their money on. \"These people don't want banner buys on Yahoo! They've been coming to us saying 'Thank God you've started this. We know we have to get involved with the internet but we couldn't find anywhere we wanted to do it!\" </p> <p> Rather than clumps of different advertising, the intention is to have different luxury brands, boutiques or high-quality department stores sponsor specific areas of the PeopleNews site. Put like that it all sounds so simple: Step 1: Find the advertising loophole. Step 2: Fill it. Step 3: Sit back and watch the money roll in. But the brief history of the internet will tell you that this get-rich-quick attitude to the web is not as easy as it sounds. Walker assures me that those at PeopleNews don't care: it was the excitement not the money that enticed them there. </p> <p>It's a familiar tune to hear from start-up staff, but it's easier to give credence to it when the majority of the 20-odd editorial staff left jobs on national newspapers and magazines. \"There are a lot of old media people here with new media experience who want to build an audience and engage with consumers. Were we nervous to leave established companies? We'd be mad not to be. But this is what we all wanted to do.\" Whether Procter's fierce reputation added to those first day nerves is something her former colleagues are sure to start speculating. But as documented as that temper was, it didn't deter Walker from accepting his position, even though he admits \"doing a bit of research into all the people involved\" beforehand. </p> <p>A further 18 of the 40-odd PeopleNews staff had also worked with Procter before, which Ostler insists \"tells you all you need to know\" about Procter's office ambience. \"I don't think she would have been subject to that if she hadn't been editor of Tatler. I mean, it suits everybody to gossip about a gossip magazine.\" Procter's libel trial against the Mail On Sunday is proof that the rumour-mongering felt more like acid on bare skin than water off a duck's back. Yet with PeopleNews she is apparently willing to inflict that pain on others.</p> <p> Not so, says Ostler, who insists that kind of \"bitchiness\" is not what PeopleNews is aiming for. \"That's the classic example of a story that interests journalists more than Joe Bloggs on the street. I don't think most people give a monkey's about the editor of glossy magazine that sells 80,000 copies. It's not a story. Who cares?\" </p> <p> Of course, those audacious blabbermouths won't be put to bed so easily. Already they've been at work, spreading the word that a rift has sprung up between Neil and Procter and their working relationship is in tatters as a result. Neil has come out from behind his non-executive chairman seat to deny the rumour - \"I have been working in complete harmony with her and her very talented team\" - but it is unlikely to do much good. As the site goes live, Procter is destined to set tongues wagging again. The real question is whether this time it will be gossip she actually wants people to hear.</p>",

I'm supposed to be going to a party at Babington House in the country tonight.\" With Procter at its helm and all this socialising documented between its walls, it is tempting to label PeopleNews.com as the online Tatler. Catherine Ostler, UK editor of the site, also had a stint at the magazine, but is keen to ensure this new project is not seen as society gossip going cyber. \"Everyone knows it would be suicidal to go down that route on the net,\" says Ostler. \"We're absolutely not for the old-fashioned Tatler and Harpers &amp; Queen-type people. These parties aren't Lord and Lady Posh. They're people on telly and we all want to know what they're up to.\" Walker will have you believe that with our insatiable desire for gossip, PeopleNews.com is onto a winner. \"We're creating a new genre,\" he says, boldly, \"the genre of people news. This is the really interesting media story of our time, the fact that people just love this kind of stuff. We reckon that with all the TV, magazines, newspapers and chatting, people spend over an hour a day doing stuff that is people news. It's gossip, it's people-based lifestyle news, it's entertainment news and it's fun.\" So far, so non-society. But aren't we now venturing into the realms of tabloid journalism, with all this talk of who wore what where? \"All the newspapers are putting those sorts of things on front pages now,\" says Walker, \"they used to be diary columns at the back but now they're all over the cover of the Daily Telegraph.\" Yet this is no broadsheet dumb-down exercise either. The People News brand is a specific one: avoiding the hagiography of Hello! and OK!, whilst sidestepping the \"people are cannon-fodder\" attitude of the tabloid world. \"We'll have a sort of meritocratic coverage. Society magazines are elite in the wrong way. We're elitist in that we want the best people on our site. For example, we'll be working with Julian MacDonald around fashion week. He's a PeopleNews person. Totally on-brand.\" What is and what isn't \"on-brand\" for PeopleNews is fundamental to the success of the site. Not only is the class of the content essential for attracting the right audience, but it also holds the financial key to the entire project. Walker argues there is a whole group of advertisers out there who have yet to get started on the net because they can't find the right site to spend their money on. \"These people don't want banner buys on Yahoo! They've been coming to us saying 'Thank God you've started this. We know we have to get involved with the internet but we couldn't find anywhere we wanted to do it!\" Rather than clumps of different advertising, the intention is to have different luxury brands, boutiques or high-quality department stores sponsor specific areas of the PeopleNews site. Put like that it all sounds so simple: Step 1: Find the advertising loophole. Step 2: Fill it. Step 3: Sit back and watch the money roll in. But the brief history of the internet will tell you that this get-rich-quick attitude to the web is not as easy as it sounds. Walker assures me that those at PeopleNews don't care: it was the excitement not the money that enticed them there. It's a familiar tune to hear from start-up staff, but it's easier to give credence to it when the majority of the 20-odd editorial staff left jobs on national newspapers and magazines. \"There are a lot of old media people here with new media experience who want to build an audience and engage with consumers. Were we nervous to leave established companies? We'd be mad not to be. But this is what we all wanted to do.\" Whether Procter's fierce reputation added to those first day nerves is something her former colleagues are sure to start speculating. But as documented as that temper was, it didn't deter Walker from accepting his position, even though he admits \"doing a bit of research into all the people involved\" beforehand. A further 18 of the 40-odd PeopleNews staff had also worked with Procter before, which Ostler insists \"tells you all you need to know\" about Procter's office ambience. \"I don't think she would have been subject to that if she hadn't been editor of Tatler. I mean, it suits everybody to gossip about a gossip magazine.\" Procter's libel trial against the Mail On Sunday is proof that the rumour-mongering felt more like acid on bare skin than water off a duck's back. Yet with PeopleNews she is apparently willing to inflict that pain on others. Not so, says Ostler, who insists that kind of \"bitchiness\" is not what PeopleNews is aiming for. \"That's the classic example of a story that interests journalists more than Joe Bloggs on the street. I don't think most people give a monkey's about the editor of glossy magazine that sells 80,000 copies. It's not a story. Who cares?\" Of course, those audacious blabbermouths won't be put to bed so easily. Already they've been at work, spreading the word that a rift has sprung up between Neil and Procter and their working relationship is in tatters as a result. Neil has come out from behind his non-executive chairman seat to deny the rumour - \"I have been working in complete harmony with her and her very talented team\" - but it is unlikely to do much good. As the site goes live, Procter is destined to set tongues wagging again. The real question is whether this time it will be gossip she actually wants people to hear.",

      "bodyText": "All the relevant action in the first Potteries derby for three seasons was crammed into five hectic minutes in the first half. Marc Bridge-Wilkinson raised home supporters' expectations when he headed in Matt Carragher's cross after 10 minutes. But five minutes later parity was restored when Kyle Lightbourne fired home the equaliser, though Stoke claimed a moral victory after Lightbourne and Marvin Robinson both hit the underside of the bar with headers in the second half. It was bad luck for the City boss Gudjon Thordarson, who was denied a victory in his first English derby. The former national coach of Iceland, who took over last season, felt his side deserved to win. According to Scandinavian superstition, Sunday should be a lucky day but on this occasion the Nordic gods failed to smile on Thordarson and he was left to wonder what he had done to upset them. \"It was nice to get a point but we should have had all three,\" he said. \"They never outplayed us and we created the better chances. We needed that bit of luck in the second half and perhaps Robinson should have put his header away.

      "body": "<p>Tottenham fans woke up this morning to discover that it was a dream after all. Two wins in a row, their team fifth in the table, only one point behind Manchester United. Another victory might have taken them top. George Graham's magic appeared to be working at last. </p> <p>Alas, it was an illusion, a trip to the Valley confirming the size of the mountain Tottenham must climb to become true top-five contenders. </p> <p>Graham's method had been forecast. He would turn Tottenham's side into a replica of his Arsenal team of the late 80s: functional but uninspired, the very dread of the White Hart Lane faithful. </p> <p>Their palliative on his appointment was the promise of success. But on Saturday Spurs looked like a team caught in a time warp. They attacked with the free spirit of someone who paints by numbers, the flourish of invention conspicuous by its absence - or his absence, having been sold to Aston Villa. </p> <p>That Tottenham still created enough chances to have won easily is a red herring. Their opponents were Charlton, a well meaning but limited side destined to struggle again this season despite moving up to eighth in the table with this win. </p> <p>Invention is in at the moment. Indeed essential. But Graham appears not to have spotted that. He seems to think that because his ideas worked 10 years ago they should work now. Hence the diet of hard work, organisation and long balls into the box, hoping for knockdowns. But the world has moved on. </p> <p>With David Ginola gone and Darren Anderton injured again, Tottenham's ideas cupboard looked as understocked as a supermarket shelf during the fuel crisis. A midfield quartet of Steffen Freund, Tim Sherwood, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Steffen Iversen, pushed forward as a third striker, says it all. </p> <p>Even in defence, Graham's reputation as a solid bricklayer is threatening to crumble. Neil Sullivan, Mauricio Taricco, Chris Perry and Ben Thatcher have all been signed. But the number of times that Charlton were waved through on Saturday, and West Ham last Monday, suggests a suitable case for the local buildings inspector. </p> <p>In the end Charlton won thanks to a combination of luck, an indefatigable team spirit, poor Spurs finishing and a series of crucial saves from Dean Kiely. </p> <p>Oh, and their goal. Paul Konchesky played a forward pass to Graham Stuart. Ramon Vega, marking Jonatan Johansson, pushed up anticipating a Stuart flick-on which would have left Johansson offside. But Stuart let the ball run, Johansson was well onside, ran at goal and calmly slotted the ball through Sullivan's legs. </p> <p>Spurs were totally deceived. Their fans are beginning to recognise the feeling.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham fans woke up this morning to discover that it was a dream after all. Two wins in a row, their team fifth in the table, only one point behind Manchester United. Another victory might have taken them top. George Graham's magic appeared to be working at last. Alas, it was an illusion, a trip to the Valley confirming the size of the mountain Tottenham must climb to become true top-five contenders. Graham's method had been forecast. He would turn Tottenham's side into a replica of his Arsenal team of the late 80s: functional but uninspired, the very dread of the White Hart Lane faithful. Their palliative on his appointment was the promise of success. But on Saturday Spurs looked like a team caught in a time warp. They attacked with the free spirit of someone who paints by numbers, the flourish of invention conspicuous by its absence - or his absence, having been sold to Aston Villa. That Tottenham still created enough chances to have won easily is a red herring. Their opponents were Charlton, a well meaning but limited side destined to struggle again this season despite moving up to eighth in the table with this win. Invention is in at the moment. Indeed essential. But Graham appears not to have spotted that. He seems to think that because his ideas worked 10 years ago they should work now. Hence the diet of hard work, organisation and long balls into the box, hoping for knockdowns. But the world has moved on. With David Ginola gone and Darren Anderton injured again, Tottenham's ideas cupboard looked as understocked as a supermarket shelf during the fuel crisis. A midfield quartet of Steffen Freund, Tim Sherwood, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Steffen Iversen, pushed forward as a third striker, says it all. Even in defence, Graham's reputation as a solid bricklayer is threatening to crumble. Neil Sullivan, Mauricio Taricco, Chris Perry and Ben Thatcher have all been signed. But the number of times that Charlton were waved through on Saturday, and West Ham last Monday, suggests a suitable case for the local buildings inspector. In the end Charlton won thanks to a combination of luck, an indefatigable team spirit, poor Spurs finishing and a series of crucial saves from Dean Kiely. Oh, and their goal. Paul Konchesky played a forward pass to Graham Stuart. Ramon Vega, marking Jonatan Johansson, pushed up anticipating a Stuart flick-on which would have left Johansson offside. But Stuart let the ball run, Johansson was well onside, ran at goal and calmly slotted the ball through Sullivan's legs. Spurs were totally deceived. Their fans are beginning to recognise the feeling.",

It is especially so when Ken Bates at Chelsea is threatening to be deadlier than the Ellis. If a reputation is worth having, it is worth defending. </p> <p>This was Villa's first home game since the chairman waved his wad of shares and survived a vote of no confidence. Player unrest has been discomfiting John Gregory. The manager needed this win and owed it to two of his disaffected men, Gareth Southgate flashing in an early striker's goal when a corner was half cleared and Julian Joachim, newly on for David Ginola, winning a generous penalty converted by Dion Dublin. </p> <p>Gregory, bare-headed, was full of praise for Southgate, who wants to play for a club that wins things. \"He has a lot of pride in himself\" with every sign of \"passion when he pulls on a Villa shirt. He had an assured game.\" In another sense, Bates's axe may have worked in Gregory's favour. \"If Luca [Vialli] was the man behind it [Southgate's unrest], this could be the end of it,\" he added. </p> <p>Ginola was playing his first home game, Benito Carbone returning after his escape from Villa. But this was no game of hair and hounds. The Frenchman was short of fitness, the Italian's flair flickered and faded for all his white boots and matching headband. The hounds were called off early. </p> <p>Bradford need stronger or more acute support up front but they were the better unit, more composed than last season, their neat play matching the intricate trellis of shadows formed on the pitch by the sun behind the girders of the uncovered stand. They made shift with Stuart McCall at the back in an unaccustomed 3-5-2 line-up and were so determined not to hump the ball that they got themselves into more trouble than Villa's greater individual talents induced. </p> <p>Disruption and distribution problems have been the talk of the week. Here only Paul Merson and Gareth Barry introduced special powers of wit, accuracy and penetration to overcome them for Villa. </p> <p>Gregory said of Ginola's substitution: \"He was treading water.\" He was virtually doing that before the long cycle phase down the temporary tunnel and the running that followed. Ginola, plugging his autobiography Le Magnifique before the match, used another metaphor when questioned about his commitment, perhaps forgetting the nickname of Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony. \"We are all musicians,\" he said. \"If the concert is bad, no money.\" </p> <p>Villa are currently a bunch of soloists and Ginola ran out of puff in the first movement. Gregory, who thinks he needs money to satisfy Southgate's ambitions, may be pleased to remember that quote.</p>",

It is especially so when Ken Bates at Chelsea is threatening to be deadlier than the Ellis. If a reputation is worth having, it is worth defending. This was Villa's first home game since the chairman waved his wad of shares and survived a vote of no confidence. Player unrest has been discomfiting John Gregory. The manager needed this win and owed it to two of his disaffected men, Gareth Southgate flashing in an early striker's goal when a corner was half cleared and Julian Joachim, newly on for David Ginola, winning a generous penalty converted by Dion Dublin. Gregory, bare-headed, was full of praise for Southgate, who wants to play for a club that wins things. \"He has a lot of pride in himself\" with every sign of \"passion when he pulls on a Villa shirt. He had an assured game.\" In another sense, Bates's axe may have worked in Gregory's favour. \"If Luca [Vialli] was the man behind it [Southgate's unrest], this could be the end of it,\" he added. Ginola was playing his first home game, Benito Carbone returning after his escape from Villa. But this was no game of hair and hounds. The Frenchman was short of fitness, the Italian's flair flickered and faded for all his white boots and matching headband. The hounds were called off early. Bradford need stronger or more acute support up front but they were the better unit, more composed than last season, their neat play matching the intricate trellis of shadows formed on the pitch by the sun behind the girders of the uncovered stand. They made shift with Stuart McCall at the back in an unaccustomed 3-5-2 line-up and were so determined not to hump the ball that they got themselves into more trouble than Villa's greater individual talents induced. Disruption and distribution problems have been the talk of the week. Here only Paul Merson and Gareth Barry introduced special powers of wit, accuracy and penetration to overcome them for Villa. Gregory said of Ginola's substitution: \"He was treading water.\" He was virtually doing that before the long cycle phase down the temporary tunnel and the running that followed. Ginola, plugging his autobiography Le Magnifique before the match, used another metaphor when questioned about his commitment, perhaps forgetting the nickname of Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony. \"We are all musicians,\" he said. \"If the concert is bad, no money.\" Villa are currently a bunch of soloists and Ginola ran out of puff in the first movement. Gregory, who thinks he needs money to satisfy Southgate's ambitions, may be pleased to remember that quote.",

She left school at 16, and moved to London, where she became involved in the emerging punk scene. Besotted with Bob Geldof, then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, after meeting him at a party, she followed the band around on tour before beginning a relationship with him.

Widely read, with a quick wit and sharp intelligence, she was also a devoted partner and mother to her and Geldof's extravagantly-named daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie.</p> <p>In 1992, she moved from night to daytime television, and began presenting Channel 4's Big Breakfast show, made by Geldof's production company, Planet 24. It was her speciality to conduct celebrity interviews from a bed, and it was there that she met the Australian musician Michael Hutchence, then lead singer with the band INXS, whom she described as \"God's gift to women\". In a blaze of tabloid publicity, she left Geldof for Hutchence a year later, and in 1996, amidst an even bigger blaze of tabloid publicity, the couple were divorced.</p> <p>Yates and Hutchence's daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily was born in August 1996. Yates was said to be gloriously happy with her new life, but her relationship with Geldof remained acrimonious and, following her arrest for alleged drug offences two months later, he won temporary custody of their three children. Yates said later that she felt like the victim of a witch hunt: \"Bob is still perceived as St Bob, and me as his wayward wife.\"</p> <p>She was devastated when Hutchence was found hanged by his belt in a hotel room in Sydney in November 1997. She refused to accept the inquest verdict of suicide, insisting that Hutchence must have died when a sexual game of autoerotic asphyxiation went wrong. Meanwhile, following the startling public revelation of Yates's true paternity in May 1997, DNA tests confirmed that Hughie Green was her real father, although she had been conceived within weeks of her mother's marriage to Jess. As one friend observed at the time: \"In the space of a month, Paula has lost her future, and her past.\"</p> <p>A year later, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with depression. She lost custody of Fifi, Peaches and Pixie, and two weeks later apparently tried to hang herself. She was then admitted to a rehabilitation clinic. Legal wrangling over her lover's estate continued, and Hutchence's father, Kelland, made an abortive attempt to win custody of his grand-daughter. Yates embarked on a series of ill-advised affairs, including one with a former heroin addict, who later sold his story to the newspapers, claiming that she slept with Hutchence's ashes.</p> <p>Yates's lippy, ludicrous public image made her an easy target for derision. She loved the spotlight, and her fame by association. Anonymity never suited her. She was vulgar, irrepressible and eccentric, and, in many ways, represented all that is silly and vacuous about modern celebrity.</p> <p>But it is her indomitable spirit that people remember, and her wholeheartedness in life and love. Paula Yates was a survivor. In a magazine interview last year, she said: \"It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day. I know it sounds like a Victorian novel, but it's true. Right now, I still think living is a noble gesture.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Paula Yates, broadcaster and writer, born April 24 1960; died September 17 2000</p>",

In 1992, she moved from night to daytime television, and began presenting Channel 4's Big Breakfast show, made by Geldof's production company, Planet 24. It was her speciality to conduct celebrity interviews from a bed, and it was there that she met the Australian musician Michael Hutchence, then lead singer with the band INXS, whom she described as \"God's gift to women\". In a blaze of tabloid publicity, she left Geldof for Hutchence a year later, and in 1996, amidst an even bigger blaze of tabloid publicity, the couple were divorced. Yates and Hutchence's daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily was born in August 1996. Yates was said to be gloriously happy with her new life, but her relationship with Geldof remained acrimonious and, following her arrest for alleged drug offences two months later, he won temporary custody of their three children. Yates said later that she felt like the victim of a witch hunt: \"Bob is still perceived as St Bob, and me as his wayward wife.\" She was devastated when Hutchence was found hanged by his belt in a hotel room in Sydney in November 1997. She refused to accept the inquest verdict of suicide, insisting that Hutchence must have died when a sexual game of autoerotic asphyxiation went wrong. Meanwhile, following the startling public revelation of Yates's true paternity in May 1997, DNA tests confirmed that Hughie Green was her real father, although she had been conceived within weeks of her mother's marriage to Jess. As one friend observed at the time: \"In the space of a month, Paula has lost her future, and her past.\" A year later, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with depression. She lost custody of Fifi, Peaches and Pixie, and two weeks later apparently tried to hang herself. She was then admitted to a rehabilitation clinic. Legal wrangling over her lover's estate continued, and Hutchence's father, Kelland, made an abortive attempt to win custody of his grand-daughter. Yates embarked on a series of ill-advised affairs, including one with a former heroin addict, who later sold his story to the newspapers, claiming that she slept with Hutchence's ashes. Yates's lippy, ludicrous public image made her an easy target for derision. She loved the spotlight, and her fame by association. Anonymity never suited her. She was vulgar, irrepressible and eccentric, and, in many ways, represented all that is silly and vacuous about modern celebrity. But it is her indomitable spirit that people remember, and her wholeheartedness in life and love. Paula Yates was a survivor. In a magazine interview last year, she said: \"It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day. I know it sounds like a Victorian novel, but it's true. Right now, I still think living is a noble gesture.\" \u0095 Paula Yates, broadcaster and writer, born April 24 1960; died September 17 2000",
