      "bodyText": "The officials who oversaw the farcical end to Saturday's FA Cup tie between Tranmere and Sunderland have been accused of breaching referees' regulations and will become the first to face a Football Association commission. After reviewing reports from both clubs and the match officials the FA said yesterday that Rob Harris, who refereed the fourth-round tie which Tranmere won 1-0, had \"less than proficiently applied the laws of the game\" by allowing Tranmere to replace a player who had been sent off. The fourth official David Unsworth and the assistant referee Tony Green are alleged to have committed technical irregularities in connection with the substitution. Tranmere's Stephen Frail was introduced after Clint Hill had been dismissed but no other Tranmere player left the pitch. Subsequently a Sunderland free-kick was taken while Tranmere had 11 players on the pitch, before the error was spotted and Andy Parkinson was taken off. The FA decided on Monday that the match would not have to be replayed. The three officials have 14 days to respond to the allegations and request a personal hearing before a commission of the FA referees' committee. The FA has again demonstrated its willingness to use video evidence to punish players by handing Wimbledon's Ben Thatcher a two-match ban for elbowing the Sunderland midfielder Nicky Summerbee. Thatcher pleaded guilty after being charged with misconduct over the incident which the referee Graham Poll failed to spot during Wimbledon's 1-0 victory at Selhurst Park 10 days ago. Already this season Middlesbrough's Brian Deane and the Leicester defender Matt Elliott have been handed one-match bans for misuse of the elbow after the FA used video evidence against them. Tottenham's Sol Campbell could face a new inquiry into an alleged fracas with a steward at Derby last season. The defender was charged with assault last April after Tottenham's 1-0 win in October 1998 but the case was discontinued last July. Police files have now been given to the FA who will judge whether Campbell must face a disrepute charge. Michael Owen could play for Liverpool against Watford on Saturday after he was told by the sports injury specialist Dr Hans M\u00fcller Wohlfahrt that there was no damage to either his left or right hamstring. Leeds will face Asia's player of the year Hidetoshi Nakata in their Uefa Cup fourth-round tie against Roma in March after the Serie A club yesterday completed the signing of the Japanese midfielder from Perugia in a \u00a310m deal. Belgian state police are threatening to strike during Euro 2000 unless new staff regulations are agreed before the finals start on June 10.",

The home nations, for example, could be grouped to include the Republic of Ireland, with the teams playing each other once and the venue changing annually. </p> <p>That would mark the end of friendlies, a scenario Kevin Keegan can be expected to greet with dismay. In the lead-up to Euro 2000 England's schedule includes matches against Argentina, Brazil and Croatia. Tactically, competitively and climatically the new proposal seems far from ideal. </p> <p>Wales and Northern Ireland are weak opposition and the five teams play a broadly similar style. Before any major tournament or a qualifying competition England would prefer to sample the style of football that lies ahead. The Football Association is certainly less than enthusiastic. </p> <p>\"We believe the world is getting smaller and we take a more global view than just looking across our own borders,\" said the FA's executive director David Davies. Under the Uefa proposal, he added, \"our matches with Argentina and Brazil would probably not be taking place. In terms of playing Scotland the interest on all sides generated over those last two matches leads me to believe we will play them more in the next decade than we did in the last. </p> <p>\"But we want to develop relationships worldwide and the events of the last 10 days [at the World Club Championship in Brazil] illustrate the importance of getting that right. We are not short of opposition throughout the world. People always want to play England.\" </p> <p>However, Scotland's coach Craig Brown supported the plan. The traditionally competitive edge of home internationals appeared to influence his thinking. \"It's a good idea,\" he said. \"I would rather play England and the other home nations than play friendlies. The fans proved at Wembley and Hampden Park that they would like to see the games played more often. I'm sure the Irish and the Welsh will be very much in favour.\" </p> <p>The Uefa proposal may be well received generally. A cross-border championship involving Holland, Belgium and France, for instance, might seem an attractive proposition. The Premiership clubs would also prefer to lose their players for a set period rather than on an ad hoc basis. </p> <p>None of this will placate England. \"We've been talking about the calendar and the place of international football within it with Uefa since last year and we are still working on it with them,\" Davies said. </p> <p>\"Our view is there needs to be a balance from which we can all go forward. I'm not sure where you are going to find room for extra games in the calendar.\" </p> <p>Better news for the FA is that Sepp Blatter will today withdraw his public support for South Africa's 2006 World Cup bid. Fifa's president is conscious of the need to be neutral in the run-up to July's decision. </p> <p>Blatter spent more than an hour with FA officials and leading members of England's 2006 campaign at a reception in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night. But, although his public stance is positive for England's chances, privately little will change. He still wants the tournament to be staged in Africa if the continent is ready.</p>",

I'm sure the Irish and the Welsh will be very much in favour.\" The Uefa proposal may be well received generally. A cross-border championship involving Holland, Belgium and France, for instance, might seem an attractive proposition. The Premiership clubs would also prefer to lose their players for a set period rather than on an ad hoc basis. None of this will placate England. \"We've been talking about the calendar and the place of international football within it with Uefa since last year and we are still working on it with them,\" Davies said. \"Our view is there needs to be a balance from which we can all go forward. I'm not sure where you are going to find room for extra games in the calendar.\" Better news for the FA is that Sepp Blatter will today withdraw his public support for South Africa's 2006 World Cup bid. Fifa's president is conscious of the need to be neutral in the run-up to July's decision. Blatter spent more than an hour with FA officials and leading members of England's 2006 campaign at a reception in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night. But, although his public stance is positive for England's chances, privately little will change. He still wants the tournament to be staged in Africa if the continent is ready.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Hollywood thrives on records being broken, and 1999 was another record-breaking year at the US box office, with ticket sales up a headline-grabbing 8% to $7.3bn. But this figure, like nearly everything else in Tinseltown, bears little relation to reality. While more than 350 films reached American screens last year, nearly 40% of the total box-office haul was accounted for by 17 blockbusters that each took in more than $100m. If that's not scary enough for the creative community, then how about this: three of the year's top-grossing four films - The Phantom Menace, Toy Story 2 and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - were sequels (or in Phantom's case, a prequel) and several others in the top 20 were either sequels, remakes or TV spin-offs.</p> <p>But even high-grossing films do not mean soaring profits for the studios these days. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents the Hollywood studios, while the average cost of producing a Hollywood film actually fell 1.4% to $52.7m in 1998, the cost of marketing and distributing movies in the US leaped 13% to $25.3m per picture. In other words, it now averages almost $80m to make and release a studio picture.</p> <p>Even this does not reflect the whole story. Production costs would be still higher if it wasn't for the fact that major stars and 'name' directors are increasingly forgoing their upfront fees in return for a huge slice of the box-office spoils. For example, actor Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg might end up earning $80m between them from their cut of Saving Private Ryan's ticket sales and ancillary revenues. Spielberg and Tom Cruise will enjoy a similar profit-sharing package on their upcoming collaboration Minority Report. Meanwhile, Cruise could pocket $60m for his dual role as producer and star of Mission Impossible 2. So even if average production costs are stabilising, the profits going back to the studios are being greatly diminished. </p> <p>Rising marketing costs reflect the fact that many of the 350-odd studio films released annually earn 40% of their total American box-office revenue during their opening weekend. If they fail to ignite the public, they're swiftly yanked off screens to make way for fresh product. This is why the studios have traditionally relied on a handful of big stars to 'open' a picture and why the salaries of those chosen few have skyrocketed in recent years. </p> <p>In 1994, two days before the release of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Time Warner-owned New Line Cinema refused to pay the film's unknown lead Jim Carrey $1m to star in another project, Dumb &amp; Dumber. But a fortnight is a long time in Hollywood. Two weeks later, with Ace Ventura a massive hit, the same studio were forced to pay the same star $7m to sign up to the same movie. </p> <p>Over the next 12 months, competition for big names went berserk. In early 1996, struggling Columbia Pictures was so desperate for a hit it paid Carrey a record $20m to star in the black comedy The Cable Guy. Suddenly this was a no-questions-asked industry standard for the big guns of the acting profession.</p> <p>Cut to three years later and not all the maths is adding up. </p> <p>Anyone remember Random Hearts, the Harrison Ford vehicle directed by Sydney Pollack? Or Payback starring Mel Gibson? Or Message In A Bottle starring Kevin Costner. And don't even mention Wild Wild West to the studio. Fat fees for actors, it seems, doesn't automatically translate into fat returns at the box office. </p> <p>One of the few ways producers can keep the stars' costs down is by offering them 'challenging' against-type roles in smaller films - the hope being that the prospect of winning awards will be as alluring as winnebagos with cable. So Bruce Willis gets to make Breakfast Of Champions, Carrey takes a big cut to make Man On The Moon, Denzel Washington signs on for Hurricane, Annette Bening turns down $4m for a Kevin Costner film in favour of American Beauty and Tom Cruise has a cameo in Magnolia. Brad Pitt - who was paid $17.5m for Fight Club - is receiving far less for British crime caper Snatch, while Leo DiCaprio took home $10m under his usual asking price for his starring role in The Beach.</p> <p>It's not just movie costs that are chastening studios. The demographic shift in the film business is also giving them cause for concern. Currently, 20% of Americans account for 66% of the box-office, and the frequent movie-going group is increasingly dominated by what number-crunchers term \"young adults\". Nearly half of film-goers between the ages of 16 and 24 average at least one visit to the cinema per month, compared with just 22% of those aged 25-34, 16% of those aged 35-44 and 15% of those between 45 and 54.</p> <p>Such figures may explain the 1999's glut of cheap and cheerful horror flicks, or the high-school makeovers of classic novels starring the teen idols of Dawson's Creek, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Party Of Five. It's a win-win situation. Several of these films feature among Hollywood's most proportionately profitable films in years (hence the forthcoming Scream 3). And even if they fail to ignite the box office - take the cruelly underrated Cruel Intentions, their low production costs and cheap talent virtually guarantees them turning a profit.</p> <p>The downside of this is that when stars rise, their demands are index-linked. This week Catherine Zeta-Jones was presented with her own production deal with a studio, while Ashley Judd was rewarded for Double Jeopardy with $4m for the romantic comedy Animal Husbandry. True, in a year's time this might look like a bargain. But no-one has forgotten how Alicia Silverstone went overnight from Clueless darling to Excess Baggage two years down the line. Nor that nearly every studio passed on Pulp Fiction, which starred the 'has-been' John Travolta, the unknown Samuel L. Jackson and the freefalling Bruce Willis.</p> <p>Of course, while the Hollywood studios are walking a tightrope they all make use of that most reliable safety net of all - the sequel. This year alone promises the arrival of Mission Impossible 2, Nutty Professor 2, 102 Dalmations, Rugrats In Paris and a prequel to The Flintstones. Meanwhile two sequels to The Matrix are in pre-production - as is Jurassic Park 3 and Episode 2 of the Star Wars saga.</p> <p>Oh, and there is also a sequel and a prequel being made to last year's most profitable film, The Blair Witch Project, which starred three unknown actors and was made for the kind of money that would barely cover the hairdressing budget of most of today's 'blockbusters'.</p>",

Such figures may explain the 1999's glut of cheap and cheerful horror flicks, or the high-school makeovers of classic novels starring the teen idols of Dawson's Creek, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Party Of Five. It's a win-win situation. Several of these films feature among Hollywood's most proportionately profitable films in years (hence the forthcoming Scream 3). And even if they fail to ignite the box office - take the cruelly underrated Cruel Intentions, their low production costs and cheap talent virtually guarantees them turning a profit. The downside of this is that when stars rise, their demands are index-linked. This week Catherine Zeta-Jones was presented with her own production deal with a studio, while Ashley Judd was rewarded for Double Jeopardy with $4m for the romantic comedy Animal Husbandry. True, in a year's time this might look like a bargain. But no-one has forgotten how Alicia Silverstone went overnight from Clueless darling to Excess Baggage two years down the line. Nor that nearly every studio passed on Pulp Fiction, which starred the 'has-been' John Travolta, the unknown Samuel L. Jackson and the freefalling Bruce Willis. Of course, while the Hollywood studios are walking a tightrope they all make use of that most reliable safety net of all - the sequel. This year alone promises the arrival of Mission Impossible 2, Nutty Professor 2, 102 Dalmations, Rugrats In Paris and a prequel to The Flintstones. Meanwhile two sequels to The Matrix are in pre-production - as is Jurassic Park 3 and Episode 2 of the Star Wars saga. Oh, and there is also a sequel and a prequel being made to last year's most profitable film, The Blair Witch Project, which starred three unknown actors and was made for the kind of money that would barely cover the hairdressing budget of most of today's 'blockbusters'.",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge will rule tomorrow on a voting rights dispute between the Labour party and one of its affiliated unions which could prove crucial in the race to become the party's candidate for mayor of London. Six London members of the Manufacturing Science and Finance union today accused the party of acting unlawfully in barring the union from taking part in the electoral college vote for the mayoral candidate because its subscriptions to the party were paid late. It is predicted that the majority of the MSF's 15,000 London region members would back Ken Livingstone, as would a substantial number from two other barred unions - the Rail Maritime and Transport, with 7,000 London members, and train drivers' union Aslef, with 3,000. If those unions are reinstated to the voting process, the close race between Frank Dobson and Mr Livingstone could result in the nomination of the former Greater London Council leader. Laura Cox QC, for the six MSF members, told Mr Justice Jonathan Parker that their union was affiliated nationally and regionally to the Labour party. Under that affiliation, the six all paid a political levy to the union and they expected to be entitled to participate in the mayoral candidate selection process by voting in a ballot to decide who the MSF should support. \"We say they are being denied that right unlawfully and we seek a declaration to that effect,\" said Miss Cox. The Labour party, she said, argued that the union was not qualified to vote because it was not fully paid-up at the designated cut-off date of December 31, 1998. But the fact was that, however late the payment was made, it was accepted by the party and formed the basis of a binding agreement entitling the union to participate in the party's activities. Gavin Millar, counsel for the Labour party, argued that the union members' case was \"misconceived\". Labour's executive committee, he said, had quite properly decided last year to enfranchise only those organisations which were paid-up at the end of the last complete affiliation year - 1998. There was nothing capricious or arbitrary in this - the same procedure was adopted in the selection of Parliamentary candidates. The six union members are: Hugh McGrillen; Jim Mortimer (a former general secretary of the Labour party); his wife Pat Mortimer; Sue Michie; Glen Sutherland and Ian Rez. The judge said he would give judgment at 10.30am tomorrow.",

Julianne Moore (Safe, Boogie Nights) co-stars as his enigmatic mistress, while Jordan-regular Stephen Rea provides a brilliantly lugubrious turn as a fusty civil-servant. Already nominated for four Golden Globes and hotly tipped as an Oscar contender, The End of the Affair follows in the footsteps of films like Brighton Rock and Our Man in Havana.

      "bodyText": "Directed by Oscar-winning Neil Jordan from the classic novel by Graham Greene, The End of the Affair is an intense love story played out in a London buckling under the Blitz. Ralph Fiennes headlines as Greene's semi-autobiographical hero - picking over the bones of a doomed romance with the aid of Ian Hart's weaselly private-eye. Julianne Moore (Safe, Boogie Nights) co-stars as his enigmatic mistress, while Jordan-regular Stephen Rea provides a brilliantly lugubrious turn as a fusty civil-servant. Already nominated for four Golden Globes and hotly tipped as an Oscar contender, The End of the Affair follows in the footsteps of films like Brighton Rock and Our Man in Havana. It's another Greene screen triumph. The End of the Affair is released in cinemas nation-wide on 11 February. However, we have organised exclusive preview screenings for Film Unlimited users on Sunday 30 January. We have 10 pairs of tickets for screenings at each of the following cinemas.

On the third day of his high court libel action over a claim that he is a \"Holocaust denier\", the 62-year-old author dismissed an allegation that he had deliberately \"mis-translated\" documentary evidence to achieve his exoneration of Hitler. The accusations were put to him during cross-examination by Richard Rampton QC, counsel for American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books, who deny libelling Mr Irving in Professor Lipstadt's 1994 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory. Mr Rampton told Mr Justice Gray, who is sitting without a jury in London, that Mr Irving had written in the introduction to his book Hitler's War that there was \"incontrovertible evidence\" that Hitler ordered on November 30, 1941 that there should be no liquidation of the Jews. But this reference should have been to a particular trainload of about 1,000 Jews deported from Berlin to Riga, Latvia, in November 1941, Mr Rampton said.

He rejected Mr Rampton's suggestion that he had mis-translated the evidence \"so as to make Hitler appear the more merciful\". Asked if he agreed he had been \"caught out\", Mr Irving replied: \"Historians are constantly being caught out by fresh documents.\" The defendants' case is that this subject is just one example which illustrates \"disreputable methods\" in Mr Irving's work. Mr Irving says Professor Lipstadt's book alleges that he has denied the Holocaust and distorted statistics and documents to serve his own ideological purposes and reach historically untenable conclusions.

Later, Mr Irving told the court that \"the German government has asked for my extradition to Germany on an alleged offence that I committed\".

Whereas Rob Harris had been left to carry the can following the FA Cup debacle, here it was Graham Barber who ruled to the surprise of everyone, not least Banks, that the offence merited only a yellow card. Tranmere's players were al ready holding a grievance from a few minutes earlier when Andy Parkinson had gone down under the challenge of Franck Passi inside the penalty area without the Frenchman being penalised. But even without the referee's assistance they were doing a pretty good job. The substitute Dean Holdsworth struck the upright with a left-foot drive and Eidur Gudjohnsen had a header saved from point-blank range during an onslaught in the final few minutes. Bolton Wanderers (4-4-2): Banks; O'Kane, Bergsson, Ritchie, Whitlow; Johansen (Warhurst, 65), Jemsen, Passi, Gardner; Hansen (Holdsworth, h-t), Gudjohnsen. Tranmere Rovers (4-5-1): Achterburg; Yates, Challinor, Hill, Roberts; Morgan, Jones, Mahon, Parkinson, Taylor (Frail, 86); Kelly. Referee: G Barber (Tring).",

I want to argue that our commitments to modernising and strengthening individual liberty and to bearing down hard on crime and disorder are not contradictory but rather are complementary parts of an ambitious overall package of reform which we are pursuing to create a safe, just and tolerant society. A package which I believe represents the most comprehensive and coherent plan to tackle crime devised by any government since the war. <br> <a name=\"a\"><b>Crime and liberty</b></a><br> Crime always involves the deprivation of one person's liberty, health, happiness or well being by another and, in extreme circumstances, the deprivation of life itself.</p> <p>No one can be simultaneously free yet live in fear. True liberty is literally impossible if your neighbourhood has descended into lawlessness and intimidation. Some of those who have suffered serious racial harassment for example, - night after night of broken windows and racist chants, of arson attacks and stone throwing have literally become prisoners in their own homes, forced to surround themselves with razor wire, steel bars, CCTV and guard dogs designed not to keep the criminals in - but to keep them out. <br> The fight against this and other types of crime and disorder will always require a proper balancing of competing rights and freedoms. The rights of defendants to cross-examine witnesses in person for example versus the need to protect vulnerable victims in court or the right to individual privacy as against the right to safer streets. Over the years the public have shown that they are more than able to weigh up the relative importance of these different liberties. The rapid spread of CCTV systems for example, with little or no public opposition suggests that most of us have been more than happy to trade a right to privacy in public spaces for a more tangible feeling of increased safety.</p> <p>These sorts of discussions about competing rights can spark off interesting contradictions. In an important book published at the beginning of 1996, David Rose pointed to the ambiguity that those on liberal left often showed in their attitudes towards how different kinds of crime should be dealt with. Whilst in general, as he pointed out, such people tended to argue that our criminal justice system was too harsh - that suspects rights weren't taken seriously enough, that punishments were too severe, that the police should have fewer not more powers, when it came to certain crimes - notably racial and domestic violence and sexual offences - they would quite often argue the exact opposite - for much stiffer legislation, tougher police action and harsher penalties, with process weighted towards the prosecution. <br> It's a habit which dies hard, as I found last week. After months of criticism for the damage I was allegedly doing to the rights of defendants through our legislation to abolish the right to elect trial by jury and our new, permanent, terrorism laws I suddenly found myself being attacked by a range of normally liberal activists and commentators for failing to use powers which I do not have to order the arrest and indefinite detention of an 87 year old suspected war criminal. (This is called internment by the way). Whilst these people may want to abolish the very clear division which has developed over many centuries between the executive and the judiciary and give politicians the power to order the arrest and detention of whoever they please - regardless of the rules of evidence and police procedure - it is not a vision of our criminal justice system which I, in even my least liberal mood, have ever contemplated.</p> <p>But then Labour home secretaries are always bound to be damned from both sides. This was true even for Roy Jenkins - who's rightly remembered as the home secretary who gave government support to private members bills to legalise abortion, homosexuality and abolish theatre censorship. He ran into severe opposition with his plans to introduce majority verdicts in jury trials, saw an 11% increase in the prison population in 1966 and 1967 and then during his second stint at the department introduced a prevention of terrorism act which was criticised for years afterwards by those on the left as draconian and illiberal. <br> The debate about the Jenkins' proposal to change from unanimous to majority verdicts in jury trials in 1967 is particularly interesting for the lessons it holds for a similar debate we are having more than thirty years later about our mode of trial bill. Then, as now, the arguments were about the loss of a supposedly ancient English right (in the case of unanimous verdicts dating back to the 14th century, whereas the right to elect was not established until the mid 19th century) - though majority verdicts had long been standard practice in Scotland. Then, as now, the move was supported by the lord chief justice and by the police service, (in particular by Robert Mark who was keen to reduce the effect of criminal intimidation of juries) but opposed by an opportunist Conservative opposition voting with more principled opponents from the liberal Left.</p> <p>During the report stage in the House for the 1967 Bill MPs queued up to criticise the measure. One MP [Mr Hale, Oldham West] even stated that \"never before in the history of Parliament has there been a provision undermining the constitution of the nation, the liberties of the people and a system of justice that, with all its faults, is the envy of the world, on less evidence, with less consideration, and with a more complete absence of reasoning in its support\". (Hansard 26 April 1967 col 1744).</p> <p>The veteran Labour MP, Sydney Silverman begged Jenkins \"not to spoil the magnificent record he is building up as the most progressive home secretary we have had for many years by this foolish thing at the dictation of a lord chief justice who seems to me to know nothing about the criminal law\" (Hansard 26 April 1967, col 1758).</p> <p>In spite of this extraordinary hyperbole, the measure passed and proved a great success and opposition to the change soon melted away. <br> This is a pattern that has become all too familiar over the years. There have been a whole string of changes like the abolition of peremptory challenge and the introduction of a prosecution right of appeal against unduly lenient sentences which though bitterly opposed by the legal profession have turned out to work without problem. As Helena Kennedy - who now opposes our mode of trial bill - pointed out in her book 'Eve was Framed' (1992) \"unfortunately, the knee jerk response of most lawyers, even those with progressive attitudes, is to resist any change which might affect the position of the defendant\". I am firmly convinced that the change we are planning to make to the right of defendants to elect jury trial is the right one. It is a sensible procedural reform which will speed up justice for defendants, witnesses and victims alike and ensure that we retain the confidence of the public in the system as a whole. Perhaps the ultimate irony given the views of many who oppose the change, is that one effect of the reform may be to reduce the prison population by increasing the number of people sentenced in the magistrates rather than crown court.</p> <p>The changes we are introducing through the mode of trial bill are just one part of a much broader package of measures we are introducing to modernise the criminal justice system and drive down crime. <br> <a name=\"b\"><b>A crusade against crime</b></a> <br> There is still a huge job of work to be done. Though crime is lower now than it was at the time of the election, England and Wales remains the most crime prone area in western Europe across a wide range of offences. Crime and the fear of crime are reducing business profits, widening inequalities in wealth and opportunity and diverting millions of pounds of precious resources away from priority areas like the health service and schools. Over the past two and a half years we have been laying the foundations for the most co-ordinated and coherent attack on crime in a generation. At every stage in the criminal justice process from the collection of evidence at scenes of crime to the treatment of victims in court to the programmes that are provided in our prisons, we have been working with those in the criminal justice system to provide the legal framework and the resources they need to lever up performance. That means more money for the DNA database and CCTV cameras, a 50% increase in funding for victim support, new legal powers to deal with young offenders, a huge increase in funding for drugs programmes in prison. For the first time ever we have finally got all of the different agencies within the system - police, prosecutors, court clerks, probation and prisons working together on common priorities with joint business plans and shared boundaries. Week by week, month by month we are getting delays down and the quality of justice up. We are targeting resources and effort on those groups who we know account for a large proportion of all crime such as persistent young offenders and people addicted to hard drugs. We are putting in place the strong leadership and support that will be needed to bring out the best from every crime and disorder partnership - to make sure that every police force and local authority is aiming at the standards set by the best. And for the first time ever we will be publishing national crime statistics next week which will show crime figures not just for police force areas but for individual police divisions to give the public the information they need to make relevant comparisons and scrutinise local performance. <a name=\"c\"><b>Bringing offenders to justice</b></a> <br> But there is one other key area - what should be a core business of the criminal justice system, catching and convicting criminals - where we are embarked on a particularly ambitious programme of reform. If the cases, which defined the crisis on our criminal justice system in the 1970s and 1980s, were those of the Birmingham six and Guildford four then I suspect that the defining case of the 1990s will come to be seen as that of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>This was a case where the injustice was not that of a wrongful conviction but of a failure to convict at all. Where the outcry was not that innocent men had spent too long in prison - but that no-one had been sent to prison at all. It was, I hope, a defining moment in the attitude of the liberal left towards punishment and prosecution as many realised, perhaps for the first time, that the person just as likely to suffer when our justice system breaks down as the unjustly convicted is the victim and their family. <br> A key message from Labour in opposition was that there was \"more crime, and more criminals getting away with it\". We pointed out that whilst crime had doubled under the previous government, the number of criminals convicted had fallen in absolute terms by a third. As a result, for example, the ratio of convictions to recorded crimes for assault had fallen from over a half in 1980 to just 14% in 1997, for sexual offences from 38% to 14% and for burglaries from 11% to 3% or 1 conviction for every 33 crimes recorded. Overall, by 1997 more than 3.2 million crimes a year were not being cleared up.</p> <p>What is more, the evidence from across the Atlantic was that this could not be blamed on some sort of more global trend. Whilst conviction rates were falling in England and Wales they had actually been increasing in the United States to the point where by 1996 a person committing a crime in the America was more likely to be caught and convicted than one committing a crime in England for all major crimes except murder.</p> <p>The proportion of rapes ending in conviction in 1996 was almost twice as high in the US as in England and the proportion of robberies ending in conviction was nearly four times greater. <br> In other words, by the time we were elected, the levels of what those working in the system call attrition had simply become unacceptable for almost all types of crime. Public confidence was waning and the perception that offenders were getting away with it was becoming depressingly true. Labour in government has made the effective prosecution and conviction of offenders a priority. First, and most urgently we have radically overhauled the CPS which had been introduced in a botched and severely under-resourced way in the 1980s causing a disastrous dip in the number of convictions. In particular, we have restored the local links between police and prosecution by creating 42 local chief crown prosecutors - one for each police force area to provide much greater local accountability for prosecution decisions. Secondly, we are, I hope, encouraging more victims to pursue their case by making it significantly less traumatic for vulnerable victims to tell their story in court. Our recent youth justice and criminal evidence act for example should help to eliminate the inappropriate and humiliating questioning which rape victims all too often had to endure about their past sexual history. And third, we are investing heavily in new technology and techniques to help the police to increase their detection rates for example by expanding the size of the DNA database and through the new national automated fingerprint system. All in all I hope that we can achieve a step change in the ability of the police to manipulate intelligence and bring offenders to justice - to halt what David in his book called the retreat from prosecution. Certainly the early signs are encouraging - the number of offenders found guilty or cautioned for a non-motoring offence increased by 74,000 in 1998 (or 7%) - the largest increase since 1980 - at the same time as total recorded crime fell. <a name=\"d\"><b>The future</b></a> <br> But our plans for the future should not just be about how we deal with offenders - but with the much broader issue of how we build a more crime proof society. At the end of the day significantly reducing crime on a permanent basis is about far more than just catching and convicting an offender - it's about preventing it happening in the first place. That means dealing with the social and emotional environments which turn young people into offenders but it also involves thinking differently about our physical environment Criminologists have compared trends in crime to an evolutionary arms race. New and innovative products - say mobile phones or laptops - are developed, often with little thought given to how stealable they might be. As the product becomes popular with the public they become equally popular with thieves - particularly in the early days before competition brings prices down. The result is a mini-crime wave or \"crime harvest\" before manufacturers finally start to catch up and fit security devices like PIN numbers or immobilisers to make the device worthless if it falls into the wrong hands. And we have seen exactly the same process with our built environment. New styles of housing or town planning become fashionable which look good on the drawing board but turn out to offer all sorts of opportunities for persistent thieves and drug dealers. Local crime rates take off - then finally and belatedly a retrofitted solution is provided - alley gates or traffic barriers or CCTV - which should have been incorporated in the first place. It is clear then that the nature of crime is always in permanent flux - as long as people are greedy or violent or impulsive there will always be an underlying tendency towards offending. Professor Ken Pease, who is currently working for the home office has pointed out that \"crime is and will remain a by-product of the way in which we conduct our lives\". Though I should add that whilst crime on some scale may always be with us, there is not the least reason for us to be resigned to current levels of crime. As we look to the future we must consider how we can intervene more effectively in this evolutionary cycle - so that crime prevention is built in at the beginning of the process of developing new products - not added retroactively once the product is already on the market. Consumer power and hard lobbying by environmentalists has finally persuaded us to take account of energy conservation and environmental protection in the products that we manufacture or buy. It is time to take 'stealability' just as seriously. The work that bodies like the design council are doing with home office support to encourage companies to design in crime resistance are an important step in this process. <a name=\"e\"><b>Conclusion</b></a> <br> I am proud to have been the first Labour home secretary in almost 20 years and proud of what we are already achieving: A public inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence The first new race relations legislation for over twenty years What amounts to the first written bill of rights this country has seen for three centuries through the human rights act to be implemented in October When history looks back I hope and believe that these will be seen as just as important in advancing the cause of individual liberty, equality and justice as any of the landmark bills of the 1960s. But I am equally proud of what we are doing in the area of crime reduction and criminal justice to advance these same causes. The crime and disorder act and forthcoming bills on areas like the regulation of intrusive surveillance are not in there because of some desire to make gestures or to be gratuitously tough. They are there because I believe that individual liberty can only flourish in a society which is free from fear and intimidation - from the cloud that crime and disorder casts over too many of our already most deprived areas. Only when we have a truly safe society will we be able to able to say that we have a truly fair society.</p>",

But whether the scheme can really protect consumers remains to be seen. </p> <p>If builders in general are cowboys, then damp-proofers are the industry's rodeo riders. Mystification, quasi-science, and incompetence are so common that it is virtually impossible for consumers to know whether they have got a good deal. </p> <p>Take the Parks. Even now, they can't be sure that their problem was correctly identified and, if it was, that it was correctly treated.

You don't. All you can do is rely on the 25- or 30-year guarantee you will have been given and hope for the best. But the guarantee will almost certainly not be as foolproof as you had been led to believe. The company that issued the guarantee may not still exist by the time you ask them to honour their commitment, and even if the company is still trading or you have sensibly paid a premium for guarantee protection, you can still get stung. </p> <p>Alex Benady has been caught out twice. \"The first time, the damp-proofer admitted liability and said he would fix the problem,\" he explains. \"He also pointed out that he was not liable for any making good, such as replastering.

The builders disagreed. Without spending a small fortune on an independent surveyor and chemical analysis, it was impossible to resolve the situation. Again, I had to cough up.\" </p> <p>Benady's experience is not unusual. \"Given the inconsistency of diagnosis and treatment between companies,\" says Duncan Larder, an assistant editor at Which?, \"you can only conclude that some damp-proofers are either inept or are blatantly trying to rip off the public.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, there is little hope of legal redress. Getting two sets of damp experts to agree about anything is next to impossible. And if they can't make up their minds, how can a judge? </p> <p>But damp problems aren't going to go away. So what are your options? At present your best bet is to use a company that is a member of the British wood-preserving and damp-proofing association (BWPDA). The BWPDA cites strict codes of practice and rigorous levels of workmanship, and offers itself as a mediation ser vice for the public, but, as with most trade associations, it is compromised by the fact that its survival depends on its members' subscriptions. When push comes to shove, it's not hard to guess where its sympathies will lie. Which is why, presumably, it elects not to make anonymous spot checks on its members' work. </p> <p>Dr Chris Coggins, director of the BWPDA, is aware of the industry's poor image, but defends his organisation's role as mediator. \"Last year we received 1,500 enquiries, of which 80 could not be resolved on the phone and needed to be referred to the contractor,\" he says. \"Five of these went to our mediation service.

Standing by his proposals in a speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research in London, Mr Straw said that the reforms would save money, speed up justice and ensure continuing public confidence in the legal system. \"I am firmly convinced that the change we are planning to make to the right of defendants to elect jury trial is the right one,\" he said. The proposals, currently in the House of Lords, would end the right of a defendant to choose jury trial in all circumstances. Former Law Lord Lord Ackner is planning to table amendments to the government's bill. He has the backing of the Tory and Liberal Democrat front benches and some Labour peers, and the move could kill off the proposals in the Lords. Mr Straw said the justice system had to be modernised and that legal reforms always sparked accusations of erosions of justice. \"I can't quite believe that the Lords are going to make such an undemocratic decision to refuse even to allow the elected House of Commons to debate this measure. \"There is this extraordinarily opportunistic alliance taking place at the moment between the Conservatives, under whom this proposal originally came forward, and Liberal Democrats and others,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. But Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC insisted that it was \"profoundly wrong\" to refuse to allow some defendants appearing in magistrates' courts the right to elect to go for trial by jury. It would be \"invidious\" to allow magistrates to decide in which court, and under which system, defendants should be tried, she told Today. Mr Straw believes that many defendants use the right to choose to be tried by a jury rather than by magistrates as a \"racket\" to string out cases. Planned reforms will take the decision out of defendants' hands and put it into the hands of magistrates. A right of appeal is also proposed, to safeguard the rights of those accused of crimes.",

The warrants granted by the Queen and the Prince of Wales are not up for review until next year.</p> <p>A spokesman for Harrods said the store had received a letter from Buckingham Palace this morning informing them of the withdrawal of the royal warrant, but he added that no reference had been made to Mr Fayed's libel case comments.</p> <p>\"This simply reflects the dwindling patronage between the Duke and Harrods over recent years,\" the spokesman reiterated.</p> <p>Harrods now has until the end of the year to have the warrant removed from the front of the store and from its stationary and packaging. It received its first royal warrant in 1913 from Queen Mary.

      "bodyText": "The feuding between Mohamed Al Fayed and the Duke of Edinburgh took a fresh turn today, when Buckingham Palace announced the Duke's royal warrant awarded to Harrods would be withdrawn. A Palace spokesman insisted the decision not to renew the honour at the end of this year was taken because of \"the significant decline in the trading relationship between the [Duke's] household and Harrods over several years\". During the recent libel case brought by Neil Hamilton, Harrods' owner Mr Fayed called the Duke \"a Nazi\" and alleged that Prince Philip and MI5 were responsible for the death of Mr Fayed's son, Dodi, and Diana, Princess of Wales. It was subsequently reported that the Palace had lost patience with Mr Fayed and would not renew any of the royal warrants granted to Harrods from Prince Philip, the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Prince of Wales. Renewal letters are being sent out to all the holders of the Duke of Edinburgh's royal warrants in the next couple of weeks. The warrants granted by the Queen and the Prince of Wales are not up for review until next year. A spokesman for Harrods said the store had received a letter from Buckingham Palace this morning informing them of the withdrawal of the royal warrant, but he added that no reference had been made to Mr Fayed's libel case comments. \"This simply reflects the dwindling patronage between the Duke and Harrods over recent years,\" the spokesman reiterated. Harrods now has until the end of the year to have the warrant removed from the front of the store and from its stationary and packaging. It received its first royal warrant in 1913 from Queen Mary. Prince Philip's warrant to Harrods was first granted in 1956. For centuries, royal warrants have been granted to trades people and companies who regularly supply goods or services to the monarchy. There are around 920 warrant holders today, who hold over 1,150 royal warrants between them, The head of the royal household, the Lord Chamberlain, advises the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother and the Prince of Wales where to grant warrants, which are renewed every five years and can be revoked at any time. Their issuing of warrants, and their withdrawal, still carries symbolic significance. Last year, the withdrawal of a royal warrant for Gallaher, the manufacturer of Benson &amp; Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes, was widely interpreted as the palace seeking to take a more sensitive line on health issues. Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said the loss of the warrant could hit Harrods' prestige and profits, with a reduction in its tourist trade. He said: \"The Royal Warrant is very impressive and very significant because it tells people that this is a business whose products are used by a member of the royal family. \"Warrants are becoming more important, not less, and I think that is a fact that Mr Al Fayed privately recognises.

He now faces a House Lords rebellion that could  kill it. Mark Tran looks at one of the oldest traditions in the  British legal system",
      "trailText": "<B>What is trial by jury</B>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is trial by jury</b> <p>The right to a trial by jury is a tradition embedded in the British legal system. The tradition of being \"tried by a jury of ones peers\" probably has its origins in Anglo Saxon custom, which dictated that an accused man could be acquitted if enough people came forward to swear his innocence.</p> <p>Trial by jury was first enshrined in law in what has been seen as the world's first proclamation of human rights - the <a href=\"http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/magnacarta/magmain.htm  l\" target=\"_ NEW\">Magna Carta</a>. The document, decreed in 1215 by King John after a rebellion by his barons, stated that a \"freeman shall not be... imprisoned... unless by the judgement of his peers\".</p> <p>The right to trial by jury was finally established absolutely in the legal system following the trial of William Penn in 1670. A jury of 12 randomly chosen citizens of London refused to convict the Quaker of \"leading a dissident form of worship\", despite being directed to by the judge and subjected to imprisonment and starvation in a bid to force their hand.</p> <p><b>How does the present system work</b></p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://www.trialbyjury.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">current system</a>, the majority of criminal offences can be tried by either magistrates or a judge and jury. At first, the magistrates consider the case. If they decide that it is too serious for them, the accused will automatically be sent to the crown court for trial by jury. But if the magistrates consider themselves able to deal with the case, the accused person has the final say: they have the right to elect for trial by jury.</p> <p><b>What is the government proposing</b></p> <p>The government wants some defendants to lose the right to choose trial by jury over magistrates' hearing. The government wants to introduce changes which will make the magistrates' decision final. Thus if the magistrates consider the case to be suitable for their court, the accused person cannot overrule them, except by appealing that decision.</p> <p>The proposed changes affect an Act of 1855 allowing some crimes to be tried by magistrates instead of a higher court if the defendant agreed. The act was designed - like the new proposals - to speed up the legal process. The offences covered included theft, burglary, actual bodily harm and criminal damage. Minor offences, such as drunkenness, could only be tried by magistrates, and major offences, such as murder and rape, only by jury. The government seeks to justify this change essentially on grounds of cost and convenience.</p> <p><b>What is Jack Straw's argument</b></p> <p>The government says the measure would cut costs and delays. There has been some rhetoric about countering manipulative criminals, who play the system in order to gain time.</p> <p><b>What do opponents say</b></p> <p>The government's attempt to curb delays will back-fire under the current proposals. In an attempt to safeguard against injustice, the bill will make it possible to appeal if the magistrates refuse to send a case to the crown court to be tried by a judge and jury. Therefore, if there are defendants who are intent on \"putting off the evil day\" - as the government alleges - there will be a whole new appeal mechanism for them to exploit, before preparations for trial even begin.</p> <p><b>Is it true Mr Straw once opposed these changes</b></p> <p>Yes. In 1997, <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,394952  7,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> he said</a>: \"Let me now refer to [Michael Howard's] proposal to end the right of many defendants to elect for trial by jury, even though they may face charges of dishonesty, and their reputation and their whole future may be at stake. Surely, cutting down the right to jury trial, making the system less fair, is not only wrong but short-sighted and likely to prove ineffective. Is it not the case that that is not only the view of the opposition and many practitioners and jurists but was the view of the home secretary, at least until today?\" </p> <p><b>How does he justify these changes</b></p> <p>In an interview in the Observer, Mr Straw said defendants and their lawyers are using the present system to 'string along' the courts by electing for crown court trial and then pleading guilty at the last moment. He told the Observer: \"It's true and I do not know a single practitioner, when I put this to them, who does not come out with a wry smile and says 'Yes', every single one.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.trialbyjury.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Trialbyjury.co.uk [opponents of Straw's plans] <br></a><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/00  3/2000003.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">The proposed legislation</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "What is trial by jury The right to a trial by jury is a tradition embedded in the British legal system. The tradition of being \"tried by a jury of ones peers\" probably has its origins in Anglo Saxon custom, which dictated that an accused man could be acquitted if enough people came forward to swear his innocence. Trial by jury was first enshrined in law in what has been seen as the world's first proclamation of human rights - the Magna Carta. The document, decreed in 1215 by King John after a rebellion by his barons, stated that a \"freeman shall not be... imprisoned... unless by the judgement of his peers\". The right to trial by jury was finally established absolutely in the legal system following the trial of William Penn in 1670. A jury of 12 randomly chosen citizens of London refused to convict the Quaker of \"leading a dissident form of worship\", despite being directed to by the judge and subjected to imprisonment and starvation in a bid to force their hand. How does the present system work Under the current system, the majority of criminal offences can be tried by either magistrates or a judge and jury. At first, the magistrates consider the case. If they decide that it is too serious for them, the accused will automatically be sent to the crown court for trial by jury. But if the magistrates consider themselves able to deal with the case, the accused person has the final say: they have the right to elect for trial by jury. What is the government proposing The government wants some defendants to lose the right to choose trial by jury over magistrates' hearing. The government wants to introduce changes which will make the magistrates' decision final. Thus if the magistrates consider the case to be suitable for their court, the accused person cannot overrule them, except by appealing that decision. The proposed changes affect an Act of 1855 allowing some crimes to be tried by magistrates instead of a higher court if the defendant agreed. The act was designed - like the new proposals - to speed up the legal process. The offences covered included theft, burglary, actual bodily harm and criminal damage. Minor offences, such as drunkenness, could only be tried by magistrates, and major offences, such as murder and rape, only by jury. The government seeks to justify this change essentially on grounds of cost and convenience. What is Jack Straw's argument The government says the measure would cut costs and delays. There has been some rhetoric about countering manipulative criminals, who play the system in order to gain time. What do opponents say The government's attempt to curb delays will back-fire under the current proposals. In an attempt to safeguard against injustice, the bill will make it possible to appeal if the magistrates refuse to send a case to the crown court to be tried by a judge and jury. Therefore, if there are defendants who are intent on \"putting off the evil day\" - as the government alleges - there will be a whole new appeal mechanism for them to exploit, before preparations for trial even begin. Is it true Mr Straw once opposed these changes Yes. In 1997, he said: \"Let me now refer to [Michael Howard's] proposal to end the right of many defendants to elect for trial by jury, even though they may face charges of dishonesty, and their reputation and their whole future may be at stake. Surely, cutting down the right to jury trial, making the system less fair, is not only wrong but short-sighted and likely to prove ineffective. Is it not the case that that is not only the view of the opposition and many practitioners and jurists but was the view of the home secretary, at least until today?\" How does he justify these changes In an interview in the Observer, Mr Straw said defendants and their lawyers are using the present system to 'string along' the courts by electing for crown court trial and then pleading guilty at the last moment. He told the Observer: \"It's true and I do not know a single practitioner, when I put this to them, who does not come out with a wry smile and says 'Yes', every single one.\" Useful links Trialbyjury.co.uk [opponents of Straw's plans] The proposed legislation",

When the nominations were announced last night, Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's poverty-row hit garnered but a cursory nod, in the low-profile Best First Feature Under $500,000 category. The Straight Story, Election, Sugar Town, The Limey and Cookie's Fortune will contest the Best Film trophy. </p> <p>Now in its fifteenth year, the Independent Spirit Awards have established themselves as the Oscars of independent American cinema. But a rigid set of guidelines has this year conspired against the independently financed Blair Witch, which converted a budget of $40,000 into box-office returns topping $140m. Spirit guidelines state that debut films cannot be nominated in either the Best Film or Best Director categories. This rules out not only Blair Witch, but also the acclaimed <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0171804\">Boy's Don't Cry</a> and Being John Malkovich. Widely viewed as the year's best indie offerings, each film is the work of a first-time director.</p> <p>With Blair Witch hamstrung by red tape, Alexander Payne's biting high-school satire Election and Steven Soderbergh's retro-thriller The Limey lead the shortlist with five nominations apiece. The Limey's star Terence Stamp is nominated for Best Actor and Soderbergh for Best Director, alongside Alexander Payne, David Lynch (for The Straight Story), Harmony Korine (for julien donkey boy) and Doug Liman (for Go). </p> <p>\u0095 The awards will be announced in LA on March 25, a day ahead of the Academy Awards.</p> <p><strong>One giant leap backwards for Jim Carrey?</strong></p> <p>Panned on release and struggling at the US box office, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0125664\"> Man on the Moon</a> is shaping up as the biggest flop of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Carrey,+Jim\"> Jim Carrey's</a> star career.

Industry experts are privately predicting that the film will be unable to recoup its budget of $52m. </p> <p>Man on the Moon's faltering fortunes are being blamed on a combination of poor reviews and a bungled release date. The picture was originally booked for cinemas last November until studio heads rescheduled it for a Christmas release in order to put the Carrey vehicle in contention for the Golden Globes. </p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.hollywood.com/index_flash.html\">Hollywood.com</a>, co-executive producer Bob Zmuda criticised the studio's decision. \"All the people who know how this stuff works felt that releasing it in November would have been the best call,\" Zmuda says. \"As Milos Forman says, this is not a Christmas film. This is an R-rated film, it ain't Toy Story, it ain't Stuart Little. There is usually a more serious film-going audience in the fall.

      "bodyText": "The Blair Witch Project may have been the cinema sensation of 1999, but the film has cut little ice with judges at the Independent Spirit Awards. When the nominations were announced last night, Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's poverty-row hit garnered but a cursory nod, in the low-profile Best First Feature Under $500,000 category. The Straight Story, Election, Sugar Town, The Limey and Cookie's Fortune will contest the Best Film trophy. Now in its fifteenth year, the Independent Spirit Awards have established themselves as the Oscars of independent American cinema. But a rigid set of guidelines has this year conspired against the independently financed Blair Witch, which converted a budget of $40,000 into box-office returns topping $140m. Spirit guidelines state that debut films cannot be nominated in either the Best Film or Best Director categories. This rules out not only Blair Witch, but also the acclaimed Boy's Don't Cry and Being John Malkovich. Widely viewed as the year's best indie offerings, each film is the work of a first-time director. With Blair Witch hamstrung by red tape, Alexander Payne's biting high-school satire Election and Steven Soderbergh's retro-thriller The Limey lead the shortlist with five nominations apiece. The Limey's star Terence Stamp is nominated for Best Actor and Soderbergh for Best Director, alongside Alexander Payne, David Lynch (for The Straight Story), Harmony Korine (for julien donkey boy) and Doug Liman (for Go). \u0095 The awards will be announced in LA on March 25, a day ahead of the Academy Awards. One giant leap backwards for Jim Carrey? Panned on release and struggling at the US box office, Man on the Moon is shaping up as the biggest flop of Jim Carrey's star career. Directed by Oscar-winner Milos Forman, Universal's biopic of the late, nearly great comedian Andy Kaufman has made a scant $31m so far and spent just two weeks in the American top ten. Industry experts are privately predicting that the film will be unable to recoup its budget of $52m. Man on the Moon's faltering fortunes are being blamed on a combination of poor reviews and a bungled release date. The picture was originally booked for cinemas last November until studio heads rescheduled it for a Christmas release in order to put the Carrey vehicle in contention for the Golden Globes. Speaking to Hollywood.com, co-executive producer Bob Zmuda criticised the studio's decision. \"All the people who know how this stuff works felt that releasing it in November would have been the best call,\" Zmuda says. \"As Milos Forman says, this is not a Christmas film. This is an R-rated film, it ain't Toy Story, it ain't Stuart Little. There is usually a more serious film-going audience in the fall. In the Christmas season, you're looking for lighter fare.\" Hilary Swank eyes up Hannibal role Hilary Swank yesterday emerged as an outside contender for the Clarice Starling role in Hannibal. iFUSE.com last night reported that the Boy's Don't Cry star had been reading for the part with Hannibal director Ridley Scott. An assistant at Swank's Creative Artists Agency confirmed that the actress had met with Scott, but would not be drawn further. The favourite to fill the role recently vacated by Jodie Foster, however, remains Cate Blanchette. But Swank's late surge reflects an abrupt career upswing for an actress tipped for an Oscar nomination for her star turn as the androgynous anti-hero of the Kimberly Peirce indie flick. Cruise considers WW2 project Tom Cruise is considering a starring role in the Columbia project Fertig, the fact-based tale of second world war soldier William Fertig, Variety reports. Playwright William Nicholson is currently writing the screenplay. But workaholic Cruise doesn't stop there; he is also committed to working with Steven Spielberg on the Fox film Minority Report later this year, which follows the Blade Runner and Total Recall route by adapting a Phillip K Dick short story for the big screen. Casting couch \u0095 David \"Fight Club\" Fincher's next project is thought to be Passengers, a sci-fi drama based on a short story which takes its inspiration from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. \u0095 Catherine Zeta-Jones has pulled out of Oliver Stone's new movie, Beyond Borders. The star of Entrapment, who has recently plighted her troth to Michael Douglas, did not give a reason for her withdrawal from the romantic thriller, but it is thought to be her desire to star in a movie with her fianc\u00e9 before their marriage later in the year. Julia Roberts is now expected to star as the humanitarian aid worker who falls in love with Kevin Costner. \u0095 Steve Martin, who successfully satirised Hollywood in Bowfinger, is set to lampoon another area of the entertainment world with Long Lost, a film about a Barry Manilow-type crooner who manipulates a wannabe starlet when his career appears to be on the wane.",

The deal, agreed at 5.30am today, values Ginger at \u00a3225m. It is a personal coup for Mr Evans, who bought Virgin Radio for \u00a385m two years ago with the backing of Richard Branson and the venture capital company Apax Partners. The two investors will split \u00a3150m of the deal with Mr Evans with the remaining \u00a375m earmarked to pay off Ginger's debts. On his breakfast radio show today Mr Evans was ecstatic. He joked with colleagues: \"They have just acquired us, we have just been acquired. How does it feel?\" \"Great,\" was the reply. About 15 minutes after his radio show finished, a beaming Mr Evans stepped out on to the street in front of Virgin Radio's central London headquarters. He confirmed that he had not been personally involved in the negotiations but that his personal involvement on Virgin Radio and within his television show, were an integral part of the deal. Mr Evans insisted that while Scottish Media Group was the larger partner, his company had not been taken over. \"If you want to put it in football terms it's like you have got a bigger squad,\" he said, adding that the new deal would make Ginger a \"bigger player\". \"You always need somebody else's help and you can never be too arrogant to ask for it.\" The Virgin Radio business will form part of a new national media division at SMG which will also include SMG's cinema advertising sales company Pearl &amp; Dean. Ginger Television, which makes Channel 4's TFI Friday and the Saturday night National Lottery programme, will sit alongside Scottish Television Enterprises which makes a raft of children's and drama programmes including Taggart. SMG shares jumped up in value by 5% on news of the Ginger deal. Andrew Flanagan, SMG chief executive, said the deal was part of an effort to secure a place alongside Granada Group plc, Carlton Communications plc and United News &amp; Media plc as a leading British media company. \"To grow the group, we really had to move beyond Scotland and what we wanted to do was build out into the rest of the UK into fast-growing sectors of the media with well-founded and well-branded businesses,\" Mr Flanagan said. He noted that Scotland represented only around 10% of the UK and said SMG had landed a good price for Ginger in terms of radio groups, at around 19 times earnings before interest and tax. Radio is one of the fastest growing advertising mediums in the UK - advertising association figures show that radio advertisers spent \u00a3463m in 1998, 3.2 percent of all UK spending, and the figure is thought to have increased substantially last year. Mr Flanagan said the deal would enhance SMG's earnings with immediate effect. The deal is subject to approval by the Radio Authority and SMG's shareholders, including the Granada group. Granada, which owns 18% of SMG, publicly opposed the Ginger deal when it was first mooted in November but Gary Hughes, group finance director at SMG, said Granada had been given \"the full facts\" on the deal yesterday. He said he hoped Granada could be convinced of its merits by the time the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders is held on January 31 to vote on the deal. Other companies chasing Ginger included US media firm Clear Channel Communications inc, French radio group NRJ and the Guardian Media Group.",

It sets a challenge to the UN to take decisive action on one of the motors of war across a swath of west and central Africa.</p> <p>The diamond trade, most of it illegal, plays a major part in the wars or shaky peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and Congo, but the actors reach far beyond west Africa.</p> <p>\"Diamonds are a magnet for organised crime,\" said Ian Smillie, one of the authors of the report, The Heart of the Matter: Sierra Leone, Diamonds and Human Security. The report is produced by Partnership Africa Canada.</p> <p>The issues of the diamond trade and sanctions are already high on the UN agenda. Backed by Britain and the United States, Canada's envoy to the UN, Robert Fowler, is heading attempts to make UN sanctions on Jonas Savimbi's Angolan rebels more effective. Mr Savimbi, once an American client, is now widely perceived as a war criminal and his Unita guerrillas as terrorists.</p> <p>Mr Fowler, who is currently in Luanda, will next week make a preliminary report to the security council, and a full report from his committee of experts will follow. They are expected to name Ukraine and a number of African countries as involved in breaching UN sanctions by their involvement in Unita's diamond trading during the most recent phase of the Angolan war, since 1994.</p> <p>The PAC report into Sierra Leone concludes that the seven year war there, in which 75,000 civilians were killed, 2m people displaced and tens of thousands mutilated, opened the country to a gangster economy based on the diamond trade. Neighbouring Liberia has, at an official level, been deeply implicated in the trade, the report concludes.</p> <p>\"By the end of the 1990s, Liberia had become a major centre for massive diamond-related criminal activity, with connections to guns, drugs and money laundering throughout Africa and considerably further afield.\"</p> <p>The Liberian connection is clearly visible in the figures for imports into Europe. Liberia has an annual diamond mining capacity of between 100,000 and 150,000 carats, but the Belgian High Diamond Council (HRD) records imports of 6m carats a year. \"By accepting Liberian exports as legitimate, the international diamond industry colludes in crime committed or permitted by the Liberian government,\" the report says. The key industrial player is De Beers.</p> <p>Underlining the incoherence and lack of transparency in the HRD's record-keeping in Belgium are Sierra Leone's own figures. These show exports recorded by the government of 8,500 carats in 1998, while the HRD's imports were 770,000 carats. Neighbouring Ivory Coast, which has had no diamond industry for more than a decade, is recorded as exporting to the HRD an average of 1. 5m carats a year in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The report calls for more support for the development of diamond \"fingerprinting\", which is being pioneered by the Canadian mounted police, as a method of recording the origins of diamonds. But certification of the origins of a diamond is a difficult business, and for that reason De Beers has not sold diamonds from Angola since October last year.</p> <p>The PAC report urges De Beers to return to Sierra Leone, saying that its breadth of control over the world market would give it the power to be part of the solution in stemming illegal sales of the country's diamonds. \"If it were to stop purchasing large amounts of diamonds from countries with a negligible production base, much could be done to end the current high levels of theft and smuggling,\" the report says.</p> <p>De Beers' director Tim Capon said yesterday that the company had not bought diamonds from Sierra Leone for about 14 years. De Beers welcomed the PAC's highlighting of the tragedy in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The report names three Canadian mining companies as among those \"willing to go to almost any length - including the provision of arms and mercenary armies - to get at the diamonds.\"</p> <p>It calls for a consumer campaign using such slogans as \"Diamonds are not a girl's best friend\", with a picture of a brutalised little Sierra Leone girl with no hands. Some 60m pieces of diamond jewellery are sold every year, indicating a sizeable target audience.</p>",

The diamond trade, most of it illegal, plays a major part in the wars or shaky peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and Congo, but the actors reach far beyond west Africa. \"Diamonds are a magnet for organised crime,\" said Ian Smillie, one of the authors of the report, The Heart of the Matter: Sierra Leone, Diamonds and Human Security. The report is produced by Partnership Africa Canada. The issues of the diamond trade and sanctions are already high on the UN agenda. Backed by Britain and the United States, Canada's envoy to the UN, Robert Fowler, is heading attempts to make UN sanctions on Jonas Savimbi's Angolan rebels more effective. Mr Savimbi, once an American client, is now widely perceived as a war criminal and his Unita guerrillas as terrorists. Mr Fowler, who is currently in Luanda, will next week make a preliminary report to the security council, and a full report from his committee of experts will follow. They are expected to name Ukraine and a number of African countries as involved in breaching UN sanctions by their involvement in Unita's diamond trading during the most recent phase of the Angolan war, since 1994. The PAC report into Sierra Leone concludes that the seven year war there, in which 75,000 civilians were killed, 2m people displaced and tens of thousands mutilated, opened the country to a gangster economy based on the diamond trade. Neighbouring Liberia has, at an official level, been deeply implicated in the trade, the report concludes. \"By the end of the 1990s, Liberia had become a major centre for massive diamond-related criminal activity, with connections to guns, drugs and money laundering throughout Africa and considerably further afield.\" The Liberian connection is clearly visible in the figures for imports into Europe. Liberia has an annual diamond mining capacity of between 100,000 and 150,000 carats, but the Belgian High Diamond Council (HRD) records imports of 6m carats a year. \"By accepting Liberian exports as legitimate, the international diamond industry colludes in crime committed or permitted by the Liberian government,\" the report says. The key industrial player is De Beers. Underlining the incoherence and lack of transparency in the HRD's record-keeping in Belgium are Sierra Leone's own figures. These show exports recorded by the government of 8,500 carats in 1998, while the HRD's imports were 770,000 carats. Neighbouring Ivory Coast, which has had no diamond industry for more than a decade, is recorded as exporting to the HRD an average of 1. 5m carats a year in the late 1990s. The report calls for more support for the development of diamond \"fingerprinting\", which is being pioneered by the Canadian mounted police, as a method of recording the origins of diamonds. But certification of the origins of a diamond is a difficult business, and for that reason De Beers has not sold diamonds from Angola since October last year. The PAC report urges De Beers to return to Sierra Leone, saying that its breadth of control over the world market would give it the power to be part of the solution in stemming illegal sales of the country's diamonds. \"If it were to stop purchasing large amounts of diamonds from countries with a negligible production base, much could be done to end the current high levels of theft and smuggling,\" the report says. De Beers' director Tim Capon said yesterday that the company had not bought diamonds from Sierra Leone for about 14 years. De Beers welcomed the PAC's highlighting of the tragedy in Sierra Leone. The report names three Canadian mining companies as among those \"willing to go to almost any length - including the provision of arms and mercenary armies - to get at the diamonds.\" It calls for a consumer campaign using such slogans as \"Diamonds are not a girl's best friend\", with a picture of a brutalised little Sierra Leone girl with no hands. Some 60m pieces of diamond jewellery are sold every year, indicating a sizeable target audience.",

Otello was probably Rossini's most successful serious opera, and one of the first repertory works - operas that were dusted off, rather like Tosca or Carmen today, whenever a theatre management decided some extra cash was needed. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the librettists of both Rossini's and Verdi's operas took Shakespeare's play as their main source. The text that Arrigo Boito prepared for Verdi's work is widely regarded as a masterpiece of its kind, but, in contrast, the libretto that the Marchese di Berio wrote for Rossini is rarely praised, even by the opera's supporters. \"Dramatically, a lot of people will say that it is weak,\" admits Bruce Ford, the Texan tenor who will sing the title role for the Royal Opera, and who has recently recorded the work for the Opera Rara label. \"But the work was a turning point for Italian opera, and I think it is one of Rossini's best.\" How can an opera that's supposedly so low on drama generate such enthusiasm? </p> <p>For a start, it's important to remember that the Othello story didn't start with Shakespeare. Its source is a short story by Giraldo Cinthio, published in 1565, and the plot Shakespeare ended up with is a fairy tale compared with the original. Desdemona is beaten to death with a stocking filled with sand, whereupon Othello pulls the ceiling down on top of her to make it look like an accident. Othello is banished and then murdered by Desdemona's relatives; the Iago character is arrested for something completely unconnected and tortured to death. Just as Shakespeare adapted this gruesome story to his own requirements, so for his libretto Berio altered the play to make something that fitted in with the operatic conventions of the time. </p> <p>While Shakespeare was writing Othello, over in Italy opera was only just finding its feet. For the next two centuries, operas were usually written as court entertainments. It was almost unthink able that an opera should have an unhappy ending. Rossini's Otello marked a turning point. For one thing, it was unambiguously and unfashionably tragic. (As late as 1820 censors forced Rossini to substitute a happy ending before the work could be performed in Rome.) More importantly, it was also one of the first operas to place any importance on the individual rather than relying on spectacle. Otello's denouement is one of the first Romantic tragic endings, and helped set a trend for Italian opera that was to last throughout the century. </p> <p>Rossini liked to style himself as an impresario's worst nightmare, out for a good time and utterly oblivious to deadlines. Aged 26, he had already written 18 operas, and is said to have written Otello, behind schedule and under duress, in the space of three weeks. Having once said he'd set a laundry list to music if he were asked, he purported to be none too picky about his librettos. He is said to have been \"startled\" when presented with Berio's text, and to have set to work on it reluctantly. Berio, on the other hand, would have preferred to write a Hamlet, but Rossini vetoed it, saying that he didn't want to compose music for a ghost. </p> <p>Yet Rossini's Otello is far from a rush job on a second-choice project. It has even been said that his handling of the third and final act marked his coming of age as a musical dramatist. Desdemona's scene with her confidante Emilia is sensitive, while the confrontation between her and Otello, her ensuing murder, the revelation of Iago's treachery and Otello's suicide are dealt with concisely, without letting operatic licence stall the flow of the action. </p> <p>While preparing the libretto, Berio was referring to two intermediary versions of the story as well as to Shakespeare's play, and the differences from Shakespeare are in some cases great - Iago is relegated to third place in the male character stakes, and the plot hinges not on a lost handkerchief but on a love letter. Berio's version may seem to us to be a watered-down one, but it was a perfectly plausible adaptation that distilled and simplified the drama. And, according to Ford, the essential character of Othello remains largely as Shakespeare wrote him - \"all the nuances of the role are still there\". So the character Ford plays should be recognisably the same as Ray Feardon's Othello in the production of the play that's currently on at the Barbican. </p> <p>By the time Verdi was composing, convention had loosened up enough for Boito to concentrate on writing a true adaptation of the play rather than a poor operatic imitation. His portrayal of Othello, again, is largely unchanged from Shakespeare's. Desdemona, as in Rossini's opera, is made into a pure, passive victim, but Iago remains a central character - so much so that for six of the seven years of its germination, the opera was intended to be named after him. The most frequent complaint from audiences more familiar with the play than the opera is that, in reducing it to a manageable length, Boito took away the opportunities for Iago to reveal his character in all its glorious complexity. But, if you listen carefully, Verdi's music puts back much of what Boito took away. George Bernard Shaw even went so far as to turn the usual comparison around, writing that Shakespeare's Othello was \"written in the style of Italian opera,\" and that Verdi's success with Boito's libretto \"proves not that he could occupy Shakespeare's plane, but that Shakespeare could on occasion occupy his\". </p> <p>Verdi's Otello is always good box office, but Rossini's tragedies are still nowhere near as popular as his comedies. The general resurgence of interest in authentic performance has meant that there are now singers, such as Ford, able to perform the works in something close to the style of the time. Rossini wrote for singers who used a light, florid style known as \"bel canto\". By Verdi's time the dramatic tenor had taken over, using mainly the heavier, \"chest\" voice. Thanks partly to the success of singers such as Placido Domingo, a celebrated interpreter of Verdi's Otello and a dramatic tenor if ever there was one, that style of singing is still in favour today - whether it's appropriate or not. </p> <p>\"Audiences want to hear dramatic tenors sing Rossini, but you can't do it - it ruins the voice,\" says Ford. Another practical problem with performing Rossini's opera today is that it was written for a company that had exceptionally fine tenors. In its original version, it requires the services of no fewer than six of them - and good tenors aren't cheap these days. </p> <p>So is it really worth it? Recent stagings in Italy and in the States have been well received, but few would argue that Rossini's Otello is without its flaws. There will always be Shakespeare purists who agree with Byron, and Verdi aficionados who feel that anything short of their hero's setting is a failure. But Verdi's operas could only exist because of what had gone before. If preconceptions are put aside, even the sceptics should be able to enjoy the work for what it is - a bold and pivotal work in the history of Italian opera. Nobody is saying that Rossini's Otello can compete with Shakespeare's or Verdi's on similar terms - but we can only lose out if we judge it as any less valid for that. </p> <p><em>Rossini's Otello is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0171-304 4000), from January 31.

Shortly afterwards McGrath retaliated by dismissing Prasad (caught by Mark Waugh) - the first wicket of the Millennium.</p> <p> <strong>I've purchased a bat signed by the West Indian and Australian teams of 1984-85. The bat is dated Dec 7-11, 1984 and marked \"third Test\". Where was this match played, and what happened in it?</strong> asks Neil Gibbins</p> <p> The match was played at the Adelaide Oval, and in fact marked the centenary of Test cricket there. West Indies won it by 191 runs - their 11th successive Test victory, a record (the run was ended by a draw in the fourth Test at Melbourne). West Indies scored 356 (Gordon Greenidge 95, Clive Lloyd 78, Jeff Dujon 77, Larry Gomes 60, Geoff Lawson 8-101) and 292-7 (Gomes 120*, Desmond Haynes 50); Australia made 284 (Kepler Wessels 98, Malcolm Marshall 5-69) and 173 (Wessels 70, Marshall 5-38). In case you want to identify the signatures on the bat, the other players were Graeme Wood, John Dyson, Steve Rixon, Kim Hughes, Allan Border, David Boon, Bob Holland and Rodney Hogg (Australia), Richie Richardson, Viv Richards, Roger Harper, Joel Garner and Courtney Walsh (West Indies). </p> <p> <strong>In the Bridgetown Test of 1934-35, West Indies (102 and 51-6 declared) lost to England (81-7 declared and 75-6).

There was no covering at the ground, so the pitch was left open to the elements. After a rainstorm, West Indies' captain Jackie Grant gambled that his fast bowlers would be able to bowl England out for less than the 73 they needed to win. Manny Martindale took 5-22, but a fine 29* from Wally Hammond took England home. </p> <p><strong>I am an Australian living in New York, and cricket is my first sporting love. I am trying to find out about the first intercolonial games in Australia. I believe New South Wales played Victoria in Sydney in the original first-class match.

Who scored the first Test-match run of the new Millennium, and who took the first wicket? asks Chris Allan The first Test run of the 2000s was scored by India's MSK Prasad, off Glenn McGrath of Australia at Sydney. Shortly afterwards McGrath retaliated by dismissing Prasad (caught by Mark Waugh) - the first wicket of the Millennium. I've purchased a bat signed by the West Indian and Australian teams of 1984-85. The bat is dated Dec 7-11, 1984 and marked \"third Test\". Where was this match played, and what happened in it? asks Neil Gibbins The match was played at the Adelaide Oval, and in fact marked the centenary of Test cricket there. West Indies won it by 191 runs - their 11th successive Test victory, a record (the run was ended by a draw in the fourth Test at Melbourne). West Indies scored 356 (Gordon Greenidge 95, Clive Lloyd 78, Jeff Dujon 77, Larry Gomes 60, Geoff Lawson 8-101) and 292-7 (Gomes 120*, Desmond Haynes 50); Australia made 284 (Kepler Wessels 98, Malcolm Marshall 5-69) and 173 (Wessels 70, Marshall 5-38). In case you want to identify the signatures on the bat, the other players were Graeme Wood, John Dyson, Steve Rixon, Kim Hughes, Allan Border, David Boon, Bob Holland and Rodney Hogg (Australia), Richie Richardson, Viv Richards, Roger Harper, Joel Garner and Courtney Walsh (West Indies). In the Bridgetown Test of 1934-35, West Indies (102 and 51-6 declared) lost to England (81-7 declared and 75-6). Why did West Indies declare at 51-6? asks S Ramesh They did it to try to make England bat on a spiteful rain-affected pitch. There was no covering at the ground, so the pitch was left open to the elements. After a rainstorm, West Indies' captain Jackie Grant gambled that his fast bowlers would be able to bowl England out for less than the 73 they needed to win. Manny Martindale took 5-22, but a fine 29* from Wally Hammond took England home. I am an Australian living in New York, and cricket is my first sporting love. I am trying to find out about the first intercolonial games in Australia. I believe New South Wales played Victoria in Sydney in the original first-class match. My great-great-grandfather was Harry Hilliard, who was quite a character in his own right, and who played in that match, I'm told. Would you have any further information? asks Peter Steep The first match between longtime rivals Victoria and NSW took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on March 26-27, 1856. It was a low-scoring affair: Victoria made 63 (JJ McKone 5-25) and 28 (McKone 5-11), and NSW replied with 76 (G Elliott 7-25) and 16-7 (F Lowe 4-9, Elliott 3-7) to scrape home by three wickets. Your ancestor Henry Hilliard made 0 and 1 not out. He was born in Sydney on Nov 7, 1826, and died in Willoughby, NSW, on March 19, 1914. Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly",

The new body, which will combat widespread corruption in Russia, would be modelled on the United States' FBI.</p> <p>\"He'll certainly try to rationalise the security organs,\" said Dmitri Trenin, a security analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre. \"There's a real need for law and order and fighting corruption.\"</p> <p>\"Steps need to be taken ... in very sore areas - notably the fight against corruption, banditry and strengthening the role of law,\" Anatoly Chubais, an influential Kremlin insider, said yesterday. \"The thing most needed is a radical strengthening of the key state functions.\"</p> <p>Over the next couple of months' campaigning for the Russian presidency, Mr Putin is expected to promise tough law and order policies which should prove popular with a public fed up with rampant criminality and sleaze.</p> <p>In the few policy statements he has made in recent weeks, Mr Putin has emphasised the need for a strong Russian state and its \"guiding role\".</p> <p>He is seen as a centraliser who will seek to rein in the country's 89 regions and concentrate power in Moscow. His spin doctors are keen to highlight his reputed admiration for Lady Thatcher, triggering talk of the \"Iron Man\" who learned from the \"Iron Lady\".</p> <p>In the communist era, the KGB and its predecessors were key instruments of repression and power in Russia. Although the FSB is not nearly as powerful as the old KGB, Mr Putin was described by the analyst Dmitri Furman as \"a post-communist Andropov; an Andropov without the remnants of communist idealism\". Yuri Andropov was the KGB chief who became Soviet president in 1982, a position he held until his death in 1984.</p> <p>Shortly before becoming acting president on New Year's Eve, Mr Putin went to the Lubyanka, the notorious secret police headquarters in Moscow, to deliver a paean to the FSB and its predecessors on the anniversary of the establishment of the Cheka, the revolutionary secret police founded in 1917.</p> <p>\"A few years ago we fell victim to the illusion that we have no enemies. This cost us dearly. Russia has its national interests and we have to defend them,\" he told an assembly of secret police officers.</p> <p>Mr Putin's decree on national security strategy, signed on Monday, stresses the need to combat corruption and organised crime.</p> <p>His shift in emphasis will also affect foreign policy. Foreign states are seeking to deny Russia influence in various parts of the world, the document states. \"A threat is also posed by strengthening political and military alliances: first of all Nato's eastward expansion and the possibility of foreign military bases and troops appearing close to Russia's borders.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin spent 16 years in the KGB, working in what was then Leningrad (now St Petersburg) and in the communist former East Germany, where he received an award for services rendered from East Germany's powerful Stasi chief, Erich Mielke. German reports this week claimed he also worked as a spy in Bonn in West Germany in the 1970s.</p> <p>Mr Putin left the KGB as a colonel in 1990. But in July 1998 Boris Yeltsin made Mr Putin the head of the FSB, a post he held until becoming prime minister last August. At the FSB, he rapidly gained a reputation for ruthless streamlining, abolishing three important FSB departments and firing 2,000 employees.</p> <p>\"Putin's arrival was marked by the promotion of [his] former colleagues to top FSB posts,\" noted Alexei Mukhin, a Moscow analyst.</p> <p>Mr Yeltsin then made Mr Putin secretary of his advisory security council, a Kremlin post now held by Sergei Ivanov, an old university friend of Mr Putin's. Another key Putin associate, Nikolai Patrushev, now heads the FSB. He joined the KGB in Leningrad in 1975.</p> <p>Mr Ivanov yesterday signalled that the security council was considering placing curbs on the Russian media.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, who has spent the bulk of his professional life as a KGB spy, is planning sweeping reforms of Russia's security services as part of his drive to restore the country to its Soviet-era status as a great power, it emerged yesterday. Mr Putin, who led the FSB, the KGB's successor organisation, has issued a decree making \"radical\" changes to Russia's national security strategy, officials said yesterday. The daily newspaper Segodnya reported that the acting president intends to establish a new \"super special service\" by merging departments of FSB counter-intelligence with elite police departments. The new body, which will combat widespread corruption in Russia, would be modelled on the United States' FBI. \"He'll certainly try to rationalise the security organs,\" said Dmitri Trenin, a security analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre. \"There's a real need for law and order and fighting corruption.\" \"Steps need to be taken ... in very sore areas - notably the fight against corruption, banditry and strengthening the role of law,\" Anatoly Chubais, an influential Kremlin insider, said yesterday. \"The thing most needed is a radical strengthening of the key state functions.\" Over the next couple of months' campaigning for the Russian presidency, Mr Putin is expected to promise tough law and order policies which should prove popular with a public fed up with rampant criminality and sleaze. In the few policy statements he has made in recent weeks, Mr Putin has emphasised the need for a strong Russian state and its \"guiding role\". He is seen as a centraliser who will seek to rein in the country's 89 regions and concentrate power in Moscow. His spin doctors are keen to highlight his reputed admiration for Lady Thatcher, triggering talk of the \"Iron Man\" who learned from the \"Iron Lady\". In the communist era, the KGB and its predecessors were key instruments of repression and power in Russia. Although the FSB is not nearly as powerful as the old KGB, Mr Putin was described by the analyst Dmitri Furman as \"a post-communist Andropov; an Andropov without the remnants of communist idealism\". Yuri Andropov was the KGB chief who became Soviet president in 1982, a position he held until his death in 1984. Shortly before becoming acting president on New Year's Eve, Mr Putin went to the Lubyanka, the notorious secret police headquarters in Moscow, to deliver a paean to the FSB and its predecessors on the anniversary of the establishment of the Cheka, the revolutionary secret police founded in 1917. \"A few years ago we fell victim to the illusion that we have no enemies. This cost us dearly. Russia has its national interests and we have to defend them,\" he told an assembly of secret police officers. Mr Putin's decree on national security strategy, signed on Monday, stresses the need to combat corruption and organised crime. His shift in emphasis will also affect foreign policy. Foreign states are seeking to deny Russia influence in various parts of the world, the document states. \"A threat is also posed by strengthening political and military alliances: first of all Nato's eastward expansion and the possibility of foreign military bases and troops appearing close to Russia's borders.\" Mr Putin spent 16 years in the KGB, working in what was then Leningrad (now St Petersburg) and in the communist former East Germany, where he received an award for services rendered from East Germany's powerful Stasi chief, Erich Mielke. German reports this week claimed he also worked as a spy in Bonn in West Germany in the 1970s. Mr Putin left the KGB as a colonel in 1990. But in July 1998 Boris Yeltsin made Mr Putin the head of the FSB, a post he held until becoming prime minister last August. At the FSB, he rapidly gained a reputation for ruthless streamlining, abolishing three important FSB departments and firing 2,000 employees. \"Putin's arrival was marked by the promotion of [his] former colleagues to top FSB posts,\" noted Alexei Mukhin, a Moscow analyst. Mr Yeltsin then made Mr Putin secretary of his advisory security council, a Kremlin post now held by Sergei Ivanov, an old university friend of Mr Putin's. Another key Putin associate, Nikolai Patrushev, now heads the FSB. He joined the KGB in Leningrad in 1975. Mr Ivanov yesterday signalled that the security council was considering placing curbs on the Russian media.",

      "body": "<p>The current issue on the euro is no longer whether Britain enters the single currency, but whether the prime minister remains in command of making that decision. The great controller may be losing control. It is a dismal spectacle, and not just for people who believe that, other things being equal, entry will soon become a vital national interest. Mr Blair's plight, which is quite largely self-inflicted, throws a startling light on the workings of modern democracy.</p> <p>Here is a leader who won a majority of 179 in elections to our national democratic forum. He's in a position of overwhelming political strength. He can look forward with more confidence than any leader before him to a repeat performance, albeit with the margin somewhat reduced, at the next election. Yet the ground is being prepared beneath him to destroy, without a democratic test, the project that forms a central part of his strategy, and he is doing almost nothing to stop such insidious pre-emption. He begins to approach the brink of an historic humiliation.</p> <p>His ministers jostle to supply their nuances. For the referendum is the critical decision: to hold it in the next parliament, or not. The trade secretary notes that inward investors are telling him there's an urgent need for clarity and a lower exchange rate. The foreign secretary says every rational member of the public must want a referendum early in the next parliament. But every time a minister speaks like this, Downing Street rushes to say their words shouldn't be taken seriously. The most powerful of modern prime ministers resists the slightest deviance from safe neutrality, essentially because he is afraid. There hasn't been a more telling contradiction since the Baroness, while deeply integrating Britain with Europe via the single European act, was urging the Brits to loathe most things Europe stood for. Mr Blair begins to look like someone doing exactly the opposite</p> <p>For there's no doubt he wants sterling to join the euro. He is a genuine European. He believes Europe is the future, and knows that his ambitions to be a leader there cannot be fulfilled from outside the euro-zone. So long as that decision remains in suspense, the rest of the EU will not treat the UK with complete fraternity. There will always be a contingent doubt. Once it became clear the referendum will not be held, reserve would turn to chilliness, and semi-intimacy to slow disintegration.</p> <p>Understanding this more deeply than I do, Mr Blair is evidently wracked by worry. He knows what he should do, but is not willing to start contriving the circumstances in which he can do it. His anxieties may be sufficiently enveloping to survive another huge election victory, and the arguable achievement - arguable even now - of the flexible five economic conditions the government has long set as a precondition. Two forces move him, and are capable of continuing to do so.</p> <p>The first is the press, to which he attaches even more significance than when he was merely leader of the opposition. Although his prime concern is to keep Murdoch and others on side for the election, the paranoia may well subsist after that. It is certain to do so if the electoral bargain has been conditional on exclusion of the euro from the campaign. If such an exclusion is agreed, there will not have been a more glaring example in recent history of a prime minister, least of all a very strong one, permitting his agenda to be set by his enemies. But that is what's in danger of happening: to keep the tycoon sweet, abandon into silence the issue that's supposed to matter most to your next administration.</p> <p>Blair's answer to all this is that he is talking about Europe as ground-work for talking about the euro at some later point when the people are readier to listen. He has made some good speeches in this sense, and Robin Cook now weighs in too. But the studious distinction is cutting little ice. Nobody hears the generalised pro-Europe speeches, because they evade the issue everyone knows is the one that matters. Only the euro has the hard edge of reality. By elaborately avoiding it, the government is conceding its opponents' point, and encouraging the belief that perhaps Europe and the euro are indeed separable: that you might, after all, have one without the other.</p> <p>The second force Mr Blair is watching out for is Gordon Brown. Mr Brown, like Mr Blair, remains a European. But he has other fish to fry. Though he's an architect of the idea that Europe should be addressed, while the euro is off-limits, somehow a major pro-Europe speech of even the loftiest kind is so far missing from the contemporary Brown canon.</p> <p>What Brown is defending into the distant and uncertain future are our flexible friends, the five economic conditions. And what is beginning to dawn is that here he has a lock on Mr Blair. It is he rather than the prime minister who owns them, and will be the judge of them. In reality he has a veto on a decision Blair might want to make, but Blair has no equivalent override on a Brown objection. If Brown remained committed against a referendum - or, more to the point, if Blair believed that Brown's commitment was in danger of revealing a public split between them - it would, to say the least, add to his other inhibitions. These men may be brothers, but the gleam of personal ambition should not be underrated in the one, nor the fear of it in the other.</p> <p>The reason such calculations become real, I agree, is that there's much evidence of the euro's unpopularity. The battle will be hard to win. Five years of unrebutted anti-euro propaganda, relentlessly pumped out by newspapers that matter, may not have succeeded in putting the currency question high among most voters' concerns. But it leaves the government shivering on the back foot, a contortion made more undignified by Blair's assertions that here is one pitch where he intended to take Britain further down the wicket than anyone since Ted Heath.</p> <p>We are thus witness to a barely credible spectacle. A government committed to entering the euro declines to mobilise either political or economic management to achieve that purpose. It watches, mesmerised, while its enemies gather. A perverse new logic awaits apotheosis. This says that not holding the referendum may now be the \"European\" thing to do. Since defeat would not only damage Blair but be a hammer-blow against support for continuing EU membership, better not to risk it. For the sake of staying in the EU, don't even try for the euro.</p> <p>Has it come to that? Not yet. But political timidity is capable of producing a catastrophe which would bestow on Tony Blair a shocking epitaph: Here lies the man who did less than Margaret Thatcher for the integration of Britain with Europe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The current issue on the euro is no longer whether Britain enters the single currency, but whether the prime minister remains in command of making that decision. The great controller may be losing control. It is a dismal spectacle, and not just for people who believe that, other things being equal, entry will soon become a vital national interest. Mr Blair's plight, which is quite largely self-inflicted, throws a startling light on the workings of modern democracy. Here is a leader who won a majority of 179 in elections to our national democratic forum. He's in a position of overwhelming political strength. He can look forward with more confidence than any leader before him to a repeat performance, albeit with the margin somewhat reduced, at the next election. Yet the ground is being prepared beneath him to destroy, without a democratic test, the project that forms a central part of his strategy, and he is doing almost nothing to stop such insidious pre-emption. He begins to approach the brink of an historic humiliation. His ministers jostle to supply their nuances. For the referendum is the critical decision: to hold it in the next parliament, or not. The trade secretary notes that inward investors are telling him there's an urgent need for clarity and a lower exchange rate. The foreign secretary says every rational member of the public must want a referendum early in the next parliament. But every time a minister speaks like this, Downing Street rushes to say their words shouldn't be taken seriously. The most powerful of modern prime ministers resists the slightest deviance from safe neutrality, essentially because he is afraid. There hasn't been a more telling contradiction since the Baroness, while deeply integrating Britain with Europe via the single European act, was urging the Brits to loathe most things Europe stood for. Mr Blair begins to look like someone doing exactly the opposite For there's no doubt he wants sterling to join the euro. He is a genuine European. He believes Europe is the future, and knows that his ambitions to be a leader there cannot be fulfilled from outside the euro-zone. So long as that decision remains in suspense, the rest of the EU will not treat the UK with complete fraternity. There will always be a contingent doubt. Once it became clear the referendum will not be held, reserve would turn to chilliness, and semi-intimacy to slow disintegration. Understanding this more deeply than I do, Mr Blair is evidently wracked by worry. He knows what he should do, but is not willing to start contriving the circumstances in which he can do it. His anxieties may be sufficiently enveloping to survive another huge election victory, and the arguable achievement - arguable even now - of the flexible five economic conditions the government has long set as a precondition. Two forces move him, and are capable of continuing to do so. The first is the press, to which he attaches even more significance than when he was merely leader of the opposition. Although his prime concern is to keep Murdoch and others on side for the election, the paranoia may well subsist after that. It is certain to do so if the electoral bargain has been conditional on exclusion of the euro from the campaign. If such an exclusion is agreed, there will not have been a more glaring example in recent history of a prime minister, least of all a very strong one, permitting his agenda to be set by his enemies. But that is what's in danger of happening: to keep the tycoon sweet, abandon into silence the issue that's supposed to matter most to your next administration. Blair's answer to all this is that he is talking about Europe as ground-work for talking about the euro at some later point when the people are readier to listen. He has made some good speeches in this sense, and Robin Cook now weighs in too. But the studious distinction is cutting little ice. Nobody hears the generalised pro-Europe speeches, because they evade the issue everyone knows is the one that matters. Only the euro has the hard edge of reality. By elaborately avoiding it, the government is conceding its opponents' point, and encouraging the belief that perhaps Europe and the euro are indeed separable: that you might, after all, have one without the other. The second force Mr Blair is watching out for is Gordon Brown. Mr Brown, like Mr Blair, remains a European. But he has other fish to fry. Though he's an architect of the idea that Europe should be addressed, while the euro is off-limits, somehow a major pro-Europe speech of even the loftiest kind is so far missing from the contemporary Brown canon. What Brown is defending into the distant and uncertain future are our flexible friends, the five economic conditions. And what is beginning to dawn is that here he has a lock on Mr Blair. It is he rather than the prime minister who owns them, and will be the judge of them. In reality he has a veto on a decision Blair might want to make, but Blair has no equivalent override on a Brown objection. If Brown remained committed against a referendum - or, more to the point, if Blair believed that Brown's commitment was in danger of revealing a public split between them - it would, to say the least, add to his other inhibitions. These men may be brothers, but the gleam of personal ambition should not be underrated in the one, nor the fear of it in the other. The reason such calculations become real, I agree, is that there's much evidence of the euro's unpopularity. The battle will be hard to win. Five years of unrebutted anti-euro propaganda, relentlessly pumped out by newspapers that matter, may not have succeeded in putting the currency question high among most voters' concerns. But it leaves the government shivering on the back foot, a contortion made more undignified by Blair's assertions that here is one pitch where he intended to take Britain further down the wicket than anyone since Ted Heath. We are thus witness to a barely credible spectacle. A government committed to entering the euro declines to mobilise either political or economic management to achieve that purpose. It watches, mesmerised, while its enemies gather. A perverse new logic awaits apotheosis. This says that not holding the referendum may now be the \"European\" thing to do. Since defeat would not only damage Blair but be a hammer-blow against support for continuing EU membership, better not to risk it. For the sake of staying in the EU, don't even try for the euro. Has it come to that? Not yet. But political timidity is capable of producing a catastrophe which would bestow on Tony Blair a shocking epitaph: Here lies the man who did less than Margaret Thatcher for the integration of Britain with Europe.",

      "bodyText": "Lord Neill last night came under attack for \"funking the issue\" of misconduct and corruption at the top of government by ruling out the appointment of an ethics commissioner to investigate allegations against ministers in the wake of the Jonathan Aitken scandal. Academics and the Liberal Democrats attacked his wide-ranging report on reinforcing standards in public life for leaving Tony Blair and the cabinet secretary with sole responsibility to decide whether a minister accused of serious misconduct should quit. Lord Neill also recommended limiting the number of special advisers appointed by the government and the introduction of a code of conduct to reign in some of their activities. In a BBC radio interview he suggested that the limit could be as high as 100 - 26 more than are currently on the payroll. Lord Neill took the decision to rule out appointing an independent investigator after receiving what one member of his committee called compelling evidence from Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary, and Lord Butler, his predecessor. In doing so he ignored evidence from Sir George Young, the shadow leader of the Commons; David Davis, Conservative chairman of the Commons public accounts committee; Peter Hennessy, professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary's College, London; Peter Preston, former editor of the Guardian; and the Times commentator Peter Riddell. All had called for an independent investigator or body to handle future inquiries after the Guardian libel case proved that Mr Aitken had lied to John Major and Lord Butler about his Ritz Hotel bill in Paris being paid by an arms dealer. Sir Richard had argued that the cabinet secretary did not have the skills to undertake investigations, but permanent secretaries should be able to advise ministers accused of misconduct. Lord Butler argued that an independent commissioner would be used to score party political points. Last night Stuart Weir, director of Democratic Audit, said: \"Lord Neill has funked this issue. He still seems to believe that all ministers are trustworthy, honourable people and therefore one just leaves it to their own judgment. This is plainly wrong.\" Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"Lord Neill has left unfinished business and a gap in public accountability. We do need an independent person. It is quite obvious that the prime minister has got far too many other things to do than hold personal inquiries into his cabinet colleagues.\" Mr Preston said: \"This is an extremely disappointing and very feeble decision. It just makes a nonsense of the situation to say that there is a ministerial code of conduct which cannot be enforced by anybody outside.\" Much of the rest of the report was welcomed by Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, provided the government implemented the proposals. Mo Mowlam, the cabinet office minister, said the government would need time to study the report's detailed recommendations, but she strongly defended its use of special advisers. Ms Mowlam said: \"We have made no secret of the number of advisers, their cost or their work. Their role, to provide strong central support and political focus, is clearly defined. Cabinet ministers are required to obtain the prime minister's approval for all appointments of special advisers. The government is totally committed to maintaining a non-political service and has given a commitment to legislation for the civil service, as and when a suitable opportunity arises.\" On the question of special advisers, the report recommends that Westminster follows the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly and limits their number, and urges that their activities be subject to a code of conduct to spell out relations between special advisers and their conduct with the media and civil servants. The current government has appointed 74 such advistors - an increase from 38 at the beginning of 1997 - employed at a cost of \u00a33.9m to the taxpayer. Lord Neill added that he would \"deplore\" spin doctors briefing journalists on behalf of their minister against rival members of the government.",

What if the need to control ministers now demands fundamental reform, including perhaps an elected second chamber and more devolution? But that hurdle is too high for Neill. Dealing with enforcement of the ministerial code - the only rules we have on how the supreme possessors of executive power should behave - he leaves it to the prime minister alone to decide how his cabinet should be investigated and judged. Neill considers a statutory ethics commissioner, Canadian-style, but concludes this would cramp the potentates' discretion. (They, by the way, include the cabinet secretary. To judge by the almost flippant observations made to Neill by Lord Butler, \"investigator\" of Jonathan Aitken, occupants of that key post may be part of the problem.)</p> <p>Neill makes sensible recommendations that usefully quieten fuss over the number and cost of Labour's special advisers. His new codes and tinkering would increase transparency - but reduce partisanship. Thereby he leaves one great question unanswered. Nolan and Neill have been about securing public confidence in our democracy. For that, don't we need more, not less, partisan politics - more dissent from within the governing party, as well as a higher strike rate from the opposition?</p>",

What if the need to control ministers now demands fundamental reform, including perhaps an elected second chamber and more devolution? But that hurdle is too high for Neill. Dealing with enforcement of the ministerial code - the only rules we have on how the supreme possessors of executive power should behave - he leaves it to the prime minister alone to decide how his cabinet should be investigated and judged. Neill considers a statutory ethics commissioner, Canadian-style, but concludes this would cramp the potentates' discretion. (They, by the way, include the cabinet secretary. To judge by the almost flippant observations made to Neill by Lord Butler, \"investigator\" of Jonathan Aitken, occupants of that key post may be part of the problem.) Neill makes sensible recommendations that usefully quieten fuss over the number and cost of Labour's special advisers. His new codes and tinkering would increase transparency - but reduce partisanship. Thereby he leaves one great question unanswered. Nolan and Neill have been about securing public confidence in our democracy. For that, don't we need more, not less, partisan politics - more dissent from within the governing party, as well as a higher strike rate from the opposition?",

      "bodyText": "The Serbian opposition will be celebrating Orthodox new year tonight in a greater state of harmony than at any stage since the end of the Nato bombing campaign. Rival opposition parties are encouraging their supporters to come together at an open-air New Year's Eve party organised by the students' resistance movement in Republic Square in Belgrade, the scene of ultimately doomed protests last year against the rule of President Slobodan Milosevic. The hitherto feuding opposition is congratulating itself on the signing of a \"historic agreement\" earlier this week in which 15 political parties adopted a joint strategy aimed at securing early presidential, parliamentary and local elections in Serbia. At their festivities the students are to name their men and women of 1999, and more than a few opposition leaders will doubtless be hoping to find their names on the list. \"We, the leaders of the democratic opposition, decided to once again demand from Milosevic and both Yugoslav and Serbian parliaments to agree to call early elections by the end of April.\" said a spokesman for the controversial and charismatic opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic. The demand for elections was accompanied by a threat of renewed anti-government protests starting in March. The action plan was the initiative of Mr Draskovic, who is trying to assume the role of overall leader of the Serbian opposition. He appears to believe that his moment has come after the failure of his rival, Zoran Djindjic, to galvanise public support during a countrywide protest campaign last summer. The decision by all the main opposition parties to support the strategy indicates a new pragmatism and a tacit admission that opposition disunity has alienated the people of Serbia. Beyond the demand for elections, Mr Draskovic's blueprint outlines a strategy for rehabilitating Serbia internationally. It contains proposals for the lifting of sanctions against Belgrade once the authorities agree to elections and for the readmission of Serbia into the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. To avoid accusations of selling out to the west, the opposition also calls for Serbian troops to be allowed to return to Kosovo. Mr Draskovic is adopting a softly softly approach to political change rather than the top-to-bottom shake-out advocated by some of his younger opposition rivals. Notably absent from his blueprint is the demand for the immediate removal of President Milosevic. Mr Draskovic is meanwhile courting disaffected members of Mr Milosevic's ruling Socialist party of Serbia, who are alarmed at the growing influence in government of the president's wife, Mira Markovic, and her associates. Serbian sceptics argue that Mr Draskovic is not interested in reforming a system which benefits the ruling elite, but merely in changing who is at the top. Political analysts believe he may be seeking an exit strategy for Mr Milosevic which would allow the Serbian leader to retreat from power without facing prosecution on war crimes charges by the international criminal tribunal in the Hague. Mr Milosevic, however, shows no signs of wanting a way out. \"Sloba and Mira have learnt that it is possible to rule without popular support,\" said Bratislav Grubacic, a Belgrade-based political analyst. The authorities have made it clear that presidential and parliamentary elections are not on the table. \"There is no parliamentary crisis in Serbia to give a reason for calling early elections,\" said Ivica Dacic, the Socialist party spokesman, adding that elections were needed only at the local level, in towns and cities where opposition parties controlled local councils. The government is widely expected to call local elections in the spring, capitalising on recent changes to the voting system which should favour the Socialists and their allies. In a sign that the display of opposition unity is rustling government feathers, the authorities have started a campaign to discredit Mr Draskovic. The federal information minister, Goran Matic, showed journalists a videotape in which an alleged spy claimed to have put Mr Draskovic in contact with the French secret services.

      "bodyText": "The Kosovo war cost the ministry of defence an additonal \u00a3400m in excess of what it would normally spend on the armed forces, it was disclosed yesterday. The figure, the first official estimate, was given by Colin Balmer, the MoD's principal finance officer in evidence to the Commons defence committee. He said the sum, which will be funded by the treasury's contingency reserve fund, did not include the cost of replacing weapons dropped on Serbia during the 78-day bombing campaign. RAF planes such as the Harrier, based at Gioia del Colle base in Italy, dropped 1,011 bombs during the conflict, according to ministry figures. They included 242 Paveway precision-guided bombs which cost between \u00a329,000 and \u00a349,000 each. MoD officials admitted there was a shortage of personnel in all three armed services. The RAF's problems in retaining skilled pilots - described in an unpublished report to the defence committee - was described by Julian Brazier, Conservative MP for Canterbury, as \"appalling\".",

We have to be careful what we say.

Not surprisingly, the lonely and desperate can often arrive with overly high expectations. \"They all want to be told they are going to win the lottery and marry a film star,\" High admits. \"But if I don't see that, I can't tell them that, can I? There is a big shortage of tall, dark, handsome strangers out there.\"</p> <p>Despite the fact that women follow their horoscopes so enthusiastically, there are relatively few female stars in the astrological firmament. \"Women did not achieve fame and notoriety as astrologers in previous centuries for the usual restricting social factors,\" Fiona Graham says.

Scientists report today that taller men have greater reproductive success.</p> <p>In unscientific language, they are more likely to get the girls, and then get them pregnant.</p> <p>Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the university of Liverpool, and two Polish collaborators, report in the science journal Nature that they analysed data for 4,419 healthy men aged 25 to 60 who had compulsory medical examinations between 1983 and 1989 in Wroclaw, Poland.</p> <p>They matched height against progeny and found that childless men were about 3cm shorter than men who had at least one child.</p> <p>In all age groups except one, men with children were significantly taller. The exception was the group born in the 1930s. Just after the second world war, men were in short supply and at a premium.</p> <p>\"We were doing this stuff on lonely hearts ads and one of the things that popped out was the tendency for males not to declare their height,\" said Professor Dunbar.</p> <p>\"They would say if they were tall, but never '5ft 2in, Danny DeVito lookalike'.</p> <p>\"We started to wonder if this was of consequence, because it is clear that people are very sensitive, they do know what the opposite sex is looking for.\"</p> <p>One of his collaborators returned to Poland, and mentioned the matter to an anthropologist, who pointed to a set of data which included height and family history.</p> <p>The three scientists think they may have demonstrated a universal truth: when it comes to selecting a mate, women have high ambitions.</p> <p>\"They are not selecting tall men because they are tall,\" said Prof Dunbar, who is 5ft 11in, and a father of three. \"They are selecting tall men because tallness is a cue for, or index of, something else. Either it is good quality genes, or a reflection of the conditions - the nutritional and social richness of the environment - the bloke grew up in.\"</p> <p>Studies in Germany, of lawyers, nurses, carpenters and middle managers, have shown that successful ones are between 2cm and 6cm taller than less successful ones.</p> <p>History is studded with stories of high achievement by those who walk tall.

      "bodyText": "It's official: women really do want a man they can look up to. Scientists report today that taller men have greater reproductive success. In unscientific language, they are more likely to get the girls, and then get them pregnant. Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the university of Liverpool, and two Polish collaborators, report in the science journal Nature that they analysed data for 4,419 healthy men aged 25 to 60 who had compulsory medical examinations between 1983 and 1989 in Wroclaw, Poland. They matched height against progeny and found that childless men were about 3cm shorter than men who had at least one child. In all age groups except one, men with children were significantly taller. The exception was the group born in the 1930s. Just after the second world war, men were in short supply and at a premium. \"We were doing this stuff on lonely hearts ads and one of the things that popped out was the tendency for males not to declare their height,\" said Professor Dunbar. \"They would say if they were tall, but never '5ft 2in, Danny DeVito lookalike'. \"We started to wonder if this was of consequence, because it is clear that people are very sensitive, they do know what the opposite sex is looking for.\" One of his collaborators returned to Poland, and mentioned the matter to an anthropologist, who pointed to a set of data which included height and family history. The three scientists think they may have demonstrated a universal truth: when it comes to selecting a mate, women have high ambitions. \"They are not selecting tall men because they are tall,\" said Prof Dunbar, who is 5ft 11in, and a father of three. \"They are selecting tall men because tallness is a cue for, or index of, something else. Either it is good quality genes, or a reflection of the conditions - the nutritional and social richness of the environment - the bloke grew up in.\" Studies in Germany, of lawyers, nurses, carpenters and middle managers, have shown that successful ones are between 2cm and 6cm taller than less successful ones. History is studded with stories of high achievement by those who walk tall. John F Kennedy rose to president of the US: his appetite for women - among them film star Marilyn Monroe - during his presidency was also legendary. But height is only part of the story. Studies in the US suggest that tall people were always perceived as being more successful, whether they actually are or not. There were exceptions - Napoleon, for instance, was very short - and unanswered questions: did tall people just grow up with more self-confidence? \"One is conscious of the fact that heads of department tend to be taller than the average,\" he said. \"I would say that professors are taller.

      "bodyText": "Japan's biggest nuclear power company yesterday demanded that Britain send two gunboats on a 40,000 mile round trip to pick up a shipment of British-produced plutonium which it refuses to load into its reactors on safety grounds. The British government is so alarmed at having to spend millions on sending the ships that it is dispatching a delegation to plead with Japanese ministers to veto the plan. The demand, by Kansai Electric Power, that British Nuclear Fuels collect the fuel it shipped to Japan with false safety documents, is the latest blow to the troubled nuclear company. It needed Japanese orders to justify opening a \u00a3300m plant to make plutonium-based mixed oxide fuel, but now seems doomed not to get any. The mixed oxide plant, mothballed for 18 months, was on the verge of gaining permission to operate last autumn when the documents scandal came to light. At the time BNFL denied that any of the fuel it had sent to Japan was involved, but before Christmas the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate revealed that the company was not being honest. BNFL was forced into an abject apology to the Japanese and the energy minister, Helen Liddell, called in the BNFL chairman, Hugh Collum, and its chief executive, John Taylor, for a reprimand. She talked of the government's \"very grave concerns\" about the falsification of quality control data. Yesterday ministers ordered Anna Walker, the director general of energy at the DTI, and Lawrence Williams, chief inspector of the NII, to go to Japan to talk the government out of sending the fuel back. Both governments fear censure if the fuel, from which plutonium could be extracted to make weapons, was shipped around the world again. Under nuclear proliferation safeguards, plutonium shipments have to be accompanied by armed vessels. BNFL armed two transport ships and trained crews to fight terrorists to deliver the fuel in the first place. Yesterday the DTI, which sees its plans to privatise 49% of BNFL and raise \u00a31.5bn for the taxpayer fading fast, confirmed that it was anxious to avoid shipping the fuel back . A spokeswoman said the fuel should be dealt with in Japan. Surprisingly the DTI found itself on the same side as Greenpeace which said it was mad to risk sending the fuel back. Pete Roche, the nuclear campaigner, said \"Both countries have more plutonium than they can ever use.

The card will contain all of the information stored on the last page of the current passport - including name, place and date of birth, sex, and a photograph. The Home Office confirmed that the Passport Agency was examining the feasibility of a new travel document but said that it was in the early stages. \"The photocard passport would be a condensed form of the current passport,\" the home office said. \"It would be additional to and would not replace the current passport.\" The passport agency, which is said to have set the end of 2002 as a possible date for the card's introduction, has drawn up a business plan of 30 priorities with the photocard coming eighth on the list. Data on the new card would be embedded into the plastic rather than superimposed on a page, making it more difficult to tamper with or forge. While there would be no technical barriers to the production of the card - photographs are already scanned onto many passports - its introduction would require ministerial and European Union approval. Bradford honours Hockney One of Britain's most cautious cities is to give its highest honour to a flamboyant gay artist who used to cart his easel and brushes round its streets in a pram. The freedom of Bradford, issued to only 20 individuals since 1898, and with a reluctance born of a suspicion of local lads who make good, will be conferred on David Hockney this summer. The honour, announced to day, will allow him to process through the city's streets with the only other living freemen - the Prince of Wales's West Yorkshire regiment, the Black Dyke Mills Band and the politician Barbara Castle. Both parties to the award took a down-to-earth view of its practicalities yesterday. \"Will I be able to travel on the buses for free?\" Hockney, 53, asked his brother Paul, a former lord mayor of Bradford when he broke the news. Bradford, meanwhile, has let it slip that honouring the painter will not harm its bid to become the European city of culture in 2008. The son of a Bradford accountant, Hockney long ago moved to California but has kept in touch with his roots in the city. He has often applied the vivid colours of his adopted home to Bradford's landscape of mills and trams, notably on the cover of the city's phone directory, which has become a collector's item. Hockney said yesterday that he was \"very, very proud\" to join the Bradford writer JB Priestley and the composer Frederick Delius in being granted the honour. Martin Wainwright Brady files complaint over photo The moors murderer Ian Brady has complained to the press complaints commission of intrusion into his privacy after the Mirror newspaper published a picture of him during a trip to hospital for a check-up. Brady also lodged protests against the Liverpool Echo and Daily Record yesterday. The picture, headlined \"Brady: the fat hunger striker\", on the Mirror's front page yesterday is the first to be seen of him in four years. Its editor, Piers Morgan, said the paper was the subject of a second complaint to the PCC yesterday about a picture of Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire ripper, published last year. \"We stand charged by two of the most murderous mass killers in British history of invading their privacy, and we stand proud,\" Mr Morgan said. \"We look forward to defending ourselves. \"I do not believe the PCC was devised to resolve invasions of privacy into the lives of serial killers, but I remain to be advised by [PCC chairman] Lord Wakeham.\" Janine Gibson Council fraud case questioned The town hall corruption inquiry in Doncaster faces a challenge today at a meeting called to consider a judge's comment that some expenses fraud charges are \"scraping the barrel\". Detectives in charge of Operation Danum, which has seen 29 arrests and nine council officers or Labour councillors so far jailed or fined, will meet lawyers from the crown prosecution service to consider Judge Jonathan Crabtree's remarks. He asked for his views to be passed to the CPS and other \"appropriate authorities\" at an initial hearing of expenses fraud claims against Doncaster's former Labour leader Malcolm Glover, who denies nine charges of claiming first class rail fares when travelling standard class. The judge said at Doncaster crown court: \"Here we are, down to squabbling about whether he travelled first class or second class. It is scraping the barrel a little bit, is it not?\" South Yorkshire police will strongly defend the two-year inquiry, which has led to a further seven councillors and council officers being bailed and involves 3,283 inquiries into allegations of expenses fiddles and planning fraud. Although convictions so far have involved relatively minor sums, the Danum team is working on claims of large-scale planning fraud. Detective Superintendent Graham Johnson, head of the operation, said yesterday: \"We will be giving careful consideration to the judge's comments, after which we will take a decision, but I can't pre-judge the outcome of the meeting.\" Martin Wainwright Donkeys pollution suspects Blackpool's famous donkeys could be partly to blame for the pollution of the resort's beaches. Research is being carried out to discover whether donkeys and seagulls can be blamed and so avoid Britain being fined by the European commission for failing to clean up Blackpool and Southport beaches 16 years after first being taken to court for the same offence. Since then North West Water has been forced to spend \u00a3350m to try to cure the problem but has failed to do so. Yesterday the company and the department of the environment claimed that seagulls and donkeys might be to blame for excess bacteria in the sea. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, admitted yesterday that Britain had been slow to react to the 1993 judgment made in the European court of justice of a \"chronic failure\" to meet quality standards. The department has two months to make a reasoned defence to the charge that it has failed to clean up the beaches in order to stave off a fine. Paul Brown Suspect 'was due to strike again' Police who arrested the man suspected of killing British student Isabel Peake and two young French women said yesterday they were afraid he would have struck again today, the 13th of the month, if he had not been caught. \"Two of his presumed victims died on the 13th, one in October and the other in December,\" a police source in Paris said. \"He was born on May 13. There's nearly always a pattern with serial killings.\" Sid Ahmed Rezala, who was detained on Tuesday by French and Portuguese police in a working class suburb of Lisbon, is due to appear in court today to be formally charged with murder and remanded in custody pending arrival of extradition papers from France. The state prosecutor in Amiens, Dominique Lebras, said Rezala should be extradited within a fortnight. He added that the 20-year-old Algerian-born suspect could be held for 40 days in Portugal and that \"the top priority is to avoid any technical error in the relevant paperwork.\" The state prosecutor in Chateauroux, near the small disused station where the body of Ms Peake was found, said yesterday that he would be \"putting some very precise questions to Mr Rezala as soon as he is back in France\". A reconstruction of her death will be staged on Saturday to test the theory that she was pushed to her death from a train door or window, said the prosecutor, Christian Ponsard. Jon Henley Wife 'hired hitman to kill husband' A woman hired a hitman to kill her husband so she could secure more than \u00a3100,000 in life insurance, Stafford crown court heard yesterday. But the plan to kill Clifford Jones, 35, fell apart when the would-be killer, Matthew Lee, attacked him as he slept at the couple's home in Beckdale, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, on last February. The jury heard that Lee, 57, hit Mr Jones with a 24inch metal crowbar. The blow woke him up and he managed to fend off the attack and escape to safety. Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting, said Sandra Jones, 38, had discussed murdering her husband of 12 years with her best friend, Julie Harvey. Jones pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder her husband at an earlier hearing. Lee, of Uttoxeter, denies conspiring to murder Mr Jones. He claims he was elsewhere when the attack occurred.

Mr Straw rejected their calls, insisting that he had to respect Gen Pinochet's medical confidentiality.</p> <p>But Pro-Pinochet Chilean sources said the home office had insisted that the report remain confidential. \"It suggested the conditions, including that the report be kept confidential.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International and other human rights groups were talking with lawyers last night about whether to mount a legal challenge.

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw gave his personal approval for Augusto Pinochet to be allowed to return home after the former Chilean dictator showed signs of senility to an independent panel of doctors earlier this month. As human rights campaigners drew up plans to challenge the home secretary through the courts, Mr Straw insisted yesterday that he had no choice in the matter after it became clear that Gen Pinochet was mentally incapable of standing trial in Spain on charges of torture. The Chilean ambassador in London, Pablo Cabrera, underlined the decline in Gen Pinochet's medical condition when he said: \"The danger of Pinochet dying is permanent, not imminent.\" Mr Straw, who delighted Lady Thatcher on Tuesday night when he announced that he was \"minded\" to allow the former dictator to return to Chile next week, initially refused to give any details of the medical examination of Gen Pinochet. But under fierce questioning from the Tories in the House of Commons yesterday, the home secretary made clear that the mental condition of the 84-year-old former dictator had seriously deteriorated towards the end of last year. Mr Straw stopped short of using the word senility - to have done so would have broken the rules on medical con fidentiality - but his message was clear. He told MPs: \"Among the criteria which I took into account were whether the senator would be in a position to follow the proceedings, whether he could give intelligible instructions to those representing him, whether he could give a coherent statement of his own case and of recollection.\" His remarks were echoed by Mr Cabrera: \"The situation of Pinochet and his health condition was very likely to deteriorate having in mind he is an 84-year-old man.\" Mr Straw decided to appoint a four-strong panel of independent doctors to examine Gen Pinochet on January 5. Human rights campaigners, who remained unmoved by the descriptions of Gen Pinochet's state, demanded the release of his medical records to allow them to mount an effective challenge. Mr Straw rejected their calls, insisting that he had to respect Gen Pinochet's medical confidentiality. But Pro-Pinochet Chilean sources said the home office had insisted that the report remain confidential. \"It suggested the conditions, including that the report be kept confidential.\" Amnesty International and other human rights groups were talking with lawyers last night about whether to mount a legal challenge. A judicial review could centre around the decision to send Gen Pinochet home and Mr Straw's refusal to disclose the medical records. Before they finalise their legal plans, the human rights groups have seven days to make submissions to Mr Straw in an attempt to persuade him to change his mind. Geoffrey Bindman, the human rights lawyer who has been advising Amnesty and others on the Pinochet case, said that he did not hold out much hope of a successful legal challenge. Mr Bindman said a judicial review application was possible, but was unlikely to succeed because the home secretary had wide discretion in extradition cases. However, he echoed the views of human rights groups around the world that the Pinochet case had been an important landmark in international justice. \"It is fortuitous that Pinochet might be able to cheat justice through ill health, but that does not detract from the importance of the principle that has now been established that former heads of state cannot claim immunity.\" The hopes of Gen Pinochet's supporters were also raised when the Spanish government, which has done little to mask its discomfort about being caught in the middle of the Pinochet saga, confirmed that it would not appeal against the decision to send him back to Chile. Baltasar Garzon, the campaigning Spanish judge responsible for the general's arrest, began preparing his response to the ruling but conceded he had little room to manoeuvre. \"The process has been a success,\" said a source close to him. \"Spanish justice has done what it had to do. If Pinochet returns to Chile it will be after the principle of extradition was granted.\" A spokesman for the crown prosecution service, which is acting on behalf of Spain, said no decision had been taken on the next move. \"We are waiting for instructions from them as to what stance they want to take. Discussions are going on between the CPS and the Spanish authorities.\" Home office sources are bracing themselves for a flurry of activity next week when Mr Straw formally announces his decision. Human rights activists will have to mount a legal challenge within minutes of Mr Straw's decision to prevent the general from fleeing the country. Matters will move at a more steady pace if the director of public prosecutions, who has been given access to the medical report on Gen Pinochet, decides to bring either a state prosecution or allow a private prosecution. However, this is unlikely because the previous DPP turned down an earlier request for a private prosecution. In Santiago, human rights lawyers promised to ambush Gen Pinochet at the airport with a flurry of legal summons and petitions to strip the former dictator of his senatorial privilege and charge him with kidnapping, murder and torture.",

Aisling Sykes, vice president of the transaction execution group at JP Morgan's London office, said that she had been sacked when she became pregnant for a fourth time and had asked to be allowed to work from home in the evenings in order to spend more time with her children. A London industrial tribunal heard that Mrs Sykes, 39, had been told by her employers that her request was similar to someone asking to take time off to play squash. Despite offering to work from home in Kensington, west London, in the evenings, she was still sacked because having more than two children was \"viewed as somehow irresponsible\". She told the tribunal how her manager's attitude changed towards her after she gave birth to a daughter Charlotte in June 1994. She had asked for a computer to be installed at her home to enable her to continue her work but her boss had considered this to be an irritation so she met with her and her personnel manager Elaine Cole to try to come to a compromise. She said: \"During the course of this meeting Elaine Cole inferred that my interest in seeing my child was equivalent to someone wishing to play squash.\" The tribunal ruled yesterday that she had been unfairly dis missed, but found that she had not suffered unlawful indirect sex discrimination. Mrs Sykes said: \"My life in the city is shattered - what I've been forced to do is professional suicide. \"We're pleased about the unfair dismissal.

It's the first of two programmes about the Spanish civil war, when the Tory MP's father supported the Republican government while the rest of his family backed Franco's rebellion. The victory of the extreme right certainly kept Spain out of the second world war - but then left it stultifying for three decades while the rest of Europe boomed. One little-noticed drawback to Panama's control of its own canal is that it has become responsible for the vast modernisation programme needed to handle the rising traffic. As Alun Lewis discovers in Testbeds (9.0pm, Radio 4), the machinery operating the three giant locks dates from 1908, and the channel, built to handle something the size of the Titanic, now needs widening if it is to cope with the 30 per cent increase in daily transits.",

      "trailText": "Over the past 18 months the row surrounding Britain's most senior woman priest has escalated into a drama of boycotts, sackings, accusations of bribery, anonymous benefactors and court proceedings. Now it teeters on the verge of an unholy apex.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The hallowed walls of St Paul's cathedral, Dundee have surely never witnessed such ill-tempered vehemence. It started as a squabble - the traditional locking horns with the modern - but that was just the beginning. Over the past 18 months the row surrounding Britain's most senior woman priest has escalated into a drama of boycotts, sackings, accusations of bribery, anonymous benefactors and court proceedings. Now it teeters on the verge of an unholy apex.</p> <p>The Very Rev Miriam Byrne has been suspended from her position as provost of the cathedral. The bishop of St Paul's, Neville Chamberlain, says she no longer enjoys his confidence. The members of what is left of her dwindled congregation and her vestry committee refuse to recognise the suspension. In the Scottish courts, Byrne and her vestry are pursuing the bishop for nearly \u00a3250,000. In the ecclesiastical courts, the bishop is preparing to pursue Byrne for her job.</p> <p>Last Sunday, as her enemies caught a whiff of her possible demise, Byrne was forced to sit in the pews of St Paul's while another priest addressed her flock. Earlier, her vestry committee had been ordered to leave St Paul's by bishop Chamberlain, or face ejection by the police. Bishop Chamberlain then changed the locks.</p> <p>After numerous attempts to oust her - and a church offer of \u00a385,000 to go quietly - Byrne is finally facing the prospect of unemployment. An undisclosed accusation against her is being investigated by a committee of the Scottish Episcopal church. If it finds a case, she will stand trial under ecclesiastical law within months.</p> <p>Byrne says she intends to mount a vigorous defence; even if found guilty she cannot be sacked unless she has committed a criminal act. But, as the pastoral battle juggernauts on, it is becoming clear that no one, least of all the church itself, is going to win.</p> <p>\"It was never a good idea to put a feminist moderniser in charge of an elderly and conservative congregation like St Paul's,\" says a senior church official. \"This has put the cause of women priests back decades. You have to wonder if anyone here has heard of judgment or moderation.\"</p> <p>Byrne, 53, came to St Paul's as it reeled from a major scandal in August 1998. Her predecessor, Michael Bunce, was forced to resign after embezzling \u00a344,000 from a company he set up to help the unemployed. The Scottish tabloids thrilled to court evidence of the lavish lifestyle Bunce had enjoyed with his ill-gotten gains. Within weeks, however, a petition was circulated at St Paul's demanding his return.</p> <p>Byrne was always going to be a controversial choice as the first woman priest in Britain to head an Anglican cathedral. She is a former Roman Catholic nun who left the convent before taking her final vows in order to marry a monk.</p> <p>After 18 years, Byrne's marriage ended. She later married a university librarian and, with his encouragement, returned to the church - this time to Anglicanism.</p> <p>By all accounts, Byrne's tenure at St Augustine's, her previous post in Dundee, was a success. Yet, for the traditionalists, her employment at St Paul's was unacceptable. When news of the new provost's identity - and, specifically, her sex - broke, George Greig, the cathedral's honorary chaplain for 13 years, resigned. He took around a dozen members of the congregation. It did not take long for further controversy to ignite. On her first Sunday in the pulpit, Byrne removed a 1970 prayer book from the aisles and replaced it with a version from 1982.</p> <p>The conservatives were outraged. \"It was the start of world war three. That's what the whole case against me was based on,\" Byrne told a local newspaper on the only occasion she has broken her silence on the subject.</p> <p>Relations between Byrne and the conservative caucus of the congregation worsened when she sacked Anne Bissett-Johnson, the cathedral administrator.</p> <p>Yet, as she was dubbed Attila the Nun and all 12 members of the original vestry called for her resignation, Bishop Chamberlain continued to offer his support. But it was obvious: something had to be done.</p> <p>As increasingly venomous phrases issued from Christian mouths, Bruce Cameron, Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney, was called in to mediate. He found no case against Byrne and, for a while, the cathedral's disputes carried on, albeit out of the public eye. Then, however, came the saga of the Aga.</p> <p>A rectory house comes with the post of provost. Despite Byrne's predecessor's elaborate lifestyle, it was generally agreed that the house was dilapidated and Byrne was given clearance to upgrade it. However, she was accused of overspending by up to \u00a319,000. Certain factions of the congregation said she had indulged her tastes in elaborate furnishings and an expensive Aga cooker. Those who detested her \"happy-clappy\" preaching style - particularly her decision to remove the phrase \"god the father and son\" from certain services - seized on the allegations. There was no peace to be found at St Paul's.</p> <p>Over the months, icy relations froze further - with a particularly cold spell last July when Byrne sacked the organist. Yet Byrne had supporters, and an anonymous donation of \u00a3250,000 last May looked set to pay her stipend - and keep her in a job - for another five years.</p> <p>However, in October, following a vote of no confidence in Byrne lodged by the cathedral chapter, Bishop Chamberlain said he would no longer perform diocesan functions at St Paul's. In short, he wanted nothing from Byrne but her resignation.</p> <p>Byrne, though, was not prepared to go. A new vestry committee gave her full support - but Chamberlain had what he thought was an ace up his sleeve. The bishop refused to release the \u00a3250,000 donation to the vestry, and the committee was forced to reach into its own pockets to pay Byrne's wages.</p> <p>Then, in December, the College of Bishops of the Episcopal Church said Byrne's ministry was no longer sustainable. Lawyers acting on behalf of Bishop Chamberlain offered her \u00a385,000 to leave St Paul's. Byrne dismissed this as a bribe and countered with a writ from Dundee sheriff court asking for the return and payment of \u00a3224,000.

      "bodyText": "The hallowed walls of St Paul's cathedral, Dundee have surely never witnessed such ill-tempered vehemence. It started as a squabble - the traditional locking horns with the modern - but that was just the beginning. Over the past 18 months the row surrounding Britain's most senior woman priest has escalated into a drama of boycotts, sackings, accusations of bribery, anonymous benefactors and court proceedings. Now it teeters on the verge of an unholy apex. The Very Rev Miriam Byrne has been suspended from her position as provost of the cathedral. The bishop of St Paul's, Neville Chamberlain, says she no longer enjoys his confidence. The members of what is left of her dwindled congregation and her vestry committee refuse to recognise the suspension. In the Scottish courts, Byrne and her vestry are pursuing the bishop for nearly \u00a3250,000. In the ecclesiastical courts, the bishop is preparing to pursue Byrne for her job. Last Sunday, as her enemies caught a whiff of her possible demise, Byrne was forced to sit in the pews of St Paul's while another priest addressed her flock. Earlier, her vestry committee had been ordered to leave St Paul's by bishop Chamberlain, or face ejection by the police. Bishop Chamberlain then changed the locks. After numerous attempts to oust her - and a church offer of \u00a385,000 to go quietly - Byrne is finally facing the prospect of unemployment. An undisclosed accusation against her is being investigated by a committee of the Scottish Episcopal church. If it finds a case, she will stand trial under ecclesiastical law within months. Byrne says she intends to mount a vigorous defence; even if found guilty she cannot be sacked unless she has committed a criminal act. But, as the pastoral battle juggernauts on, it is becoming clear that no one, least of all the church itself, is going to win. \"It was never a good idea to put a feminist moderniser in charge of an elderly and conservative congregation like St Paul's,\" says a senior church official. \"This has put the cause of women priests back decades. You have to wonder if anyone here has heard of judgment or moderation.\" Byrne, 53, came to St Paul's as it reeled from a major scandal in August 1998. Her predecessor, Michael Bunce, was forced to resign after embezzling \u00a344,000 from a company he set up to help the unemployed. The Scottish tabloids thrilled to court evidence of the lavish lifestyle Bunce had enjoyed with his ill-gotten gains. Within weeks, however, a petition was circulated at St Paul's demanding his return. Byrne was always going to be a controversial choice as the first woman priest in Britain to head an Anglican cathedral. She is a former Roman Catholic nun who left the convent before taking her final vows in order to marry a monk. After 18 years, Byrne's marriage ended. She later married a university librarian and, with his encouragement, returned to the church - this time to Anglicanism. By all accounts, Byrne's tenure at St Augustine's, her previous post in Dundee, was a success. Yet, for the traditionalists, her employment at St Paul's was unacceptable. When news of the new provost's identity - and, specifically, her sex - broke, George Greig, the cathedral's honorary chaplain for 13 years, resigned. He took around a dozen members of the congregation. It did not take long for further controversy to ignite. On her first Sunday in the pulpit, Byrne removed a 1970 prayer book from the aisles and replaced it with a version from 1982. The conservatives were outraged. \"It was the start of world war three. That's what the whole case against me was based on,\" Byrne told a local newspaper on the only occasion she has broken her silence on the subject. Relations between Byrne and the conservative caucus of the congregation worsened when she sacked Anne Bissett-Johnson, the cathedral administrator. Yet, as she was dubbed Attila the Nun and all 12 members of the original vestry called for her resignation, Bishop Chamberlain continued to offer his support. But it was obvious: something had to be done. As increasingly venomous phrases issued from Christian mouths, Bruce Cameron, Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney, was called in to mediate. He found no case against Byrne and, for a while, the cathedral's disputes carried on, albeit out of the public eye. Then, however, came the saga of the Aga. A rectory house comes with the post of provost. Despite Byrne's predecessor's elaborate lifestyle, it was generally agreed that the house was dilapidated and Byrne was given clearance to upgrade it. However, she was accused of overspending by up to \u00a319,000. Certain factions of the congregation said she had indulged her tastes in elaborate furnishings and an expensive Aga cooker. Those who detested her \"happy-clappy\" preaching style - particularly her decision to remove the phrase \"god the father and son\" from certain services - seized on the allegations. There was no peace to be found at St Paul's. Over the months, icy relations froze further - with a particularly cold spell last July when Byrne sacked the organist. Yet Byrne had supporters, and an anonymous donation of \u00a3250,000 last May looked set to pay her stipend - and keep her in a job - for another five years. However, in October, following a vote of no confidence in Byrne lodged by the cathedral chapter, Bishop Chamberlain said he would no longer perform diocesan functions at St Paul's. In short, he wanted nothing from Byrne but her resignation. Byrne, though, was not prepared to go. A new vestry committee gave her full support - but Chamberlain had what he thought was an ace up his sleeve. The bishop refused to release the \u00a3250,000 donation to the vestry, and the committee was forced to reach into its own pockets to pay Byrne's wages. Then, in December, the College of Bishops of the Episcopal Church said Byrne's ministry was no longer sustainable. Lawyers acting on behalf of Bishop Chamberlain offered her \u00a385,000 to leave St Paul's. Byrne dismissed this as a bribe and countered with a writ from Dundee sheriff court asking for the return and payment of \u00a3224,000. On Friday, Byrne was finally forced from her post - albeit temporarily. Byrne's supporters accuse Bishop Chamberlain of acting with high-handed disregard for their wishes. The bishop refuses to meet the vestry committee and his offer to speak to the congregation in twos and threes has been turned down. Through statements issued via the vestry, Byrne insists the decision to suspend her has nothing to do with her theology or the way she practised her vocation. Bishop Chamberlain declines to comment - but the vestry committee demands that he does. \"Only God and Bishop Neville know for certain why things have reached this unfortunate level,\" says Bob Cummings, a lay vestry member who was ordered out of the cathedral by the bishop. \"I fail to understand why we as Christians can get in to such a sorry state, but a bishop owes it to his flock to set an example.\" As the investigation committee continues its inquiries into the allegations made against Byrne, only one thing seems to shine through the ecclesiastical cobwebs and bile. A row started by those who believe the role of provost to be an unsuitable job for a woman has made an unsuitable spectacle of a church.",

Nevertheless Joan Garces, a former aide to the Chilean president Salvador Allende, who died in the 1973 coup led by Gen Pinochet, urged all countries where charges are pending against Gen Pinochet to put up a united front. Belgium, Denmark and France have also issued extradition requests.

It is already helping to drive the market for toys and games, from CyberLife's Creatures to Tamagotchis to Sony's AIBO robot dog, while \"intelligent agents\" (software robots) are expected to become indispensable on the internet. </p> <p>Indeed, a generation of children is already becoming acclimatised to A-life through keeping \"virtual pets\" who \"live\" in personal computers. Many keep dogs and cats as mess-free screen pets, thanks to Mindscape's Dogz and Catz programs, while Creatures allows them to explore breeding and genetic manipulation using Norns. </p> <p>Steve Grand, the British designer of the Creatures program, says: \"Probably some of the best artificial life scientists in the world are 13 year old American girls, because of what they've done with Creatures. There's even a Norn genome project like the human genome project, and some people are doing mutation tracking.\" </p> <p>Toys also allow companies to experiment with advanced technologies that may not be ready for hard commercial use, such as speech recognition. For example, you can talk to Fujitsu's Fin Fin, a parrot-like \"virtual pet\" with a head like a dolphin, and Lernout &amp; Hauspie's Talking Max2, a cartoon parrot, even talks back. Max needs to be trained, of course, but he can obey verbal commands and engage in witty conversations. (Both the Fin Fin and Max2 programs come complete with microphones.) </p> <p>As computers become more powerful, designers will be able to simulate more sophisticated life forms, including people. Just before Christmas, Mindscape launched Babyz as the natural progression from Dogz and Catz. Other companies, such as Dave Morris's AIdeaLabs in Texas, have already tried \"virtual girlfriends\", and Electronic Arts is about to launch a people simulation called The Sims, which has been developed by Will Wright, founder of Maxis and creator of the Sim City series. </p> <p>As David Crane discovered when he pioneered the idea of keeping a person as a pet in Little Computer People - launched in the 1980s for the Commodore 64 home computer - the problem is making the simulation varied and believable enough to keep the player's interest. And the way to do that is to give the creatures the ability to learn, and to reward them for learning things, which is how Creatures works. </p> <p>When they become smarter, of course, artificial life constructs will have to go out to work. They will probably become a standard part of computer interfaces, and make it easier to do things on the internet. Microsoft's Office suite and Word 2000 already provide an (admittedly stupid) \"intelligent agent\" as an optional interface to the help system, and users can substitute a cartoon dog, or a companionable cat for the now-familiar animated paperclip. The same Microsoft Agent technology is also being used experimentally on dozens of web sites. </p> <p>There is a huge potential market for such AI (artificial intelligence) constructs. Software robots - bots for short - will provide intelligent opponents for games players, especially in multi-user online games. They'll scour the web for information, like the ones pioneered by another British company, Autonomy. They'll go comparison shopping to find their owners the best prices. Eventually they'll become smart enough to answer the phone and much of your electronic mail. </p> <p>But some people are already worried about what happens when they become too smart. Professor Hugo de Garis, a \"brain builder\" based in Japan, believes that what will actually dominate the century is a battle for \"species dominance\". He says: \"Humanity is going to have to decide whether it does or doesn't build artilects (artificial intellects), which are coming simply due to the rise of the technologies. It's the Terminator scenario . . .\" </p> <p>Will bots and robots still be our pets, like the Robo Kitten that de Garis is developing? Or will we be theirs? Will people amuse themselves by breeding and educating artificial life forms like the Norns in Creatures, or will they amuse themselves by breeding and educating us? </p> <p>Such worries sound silly. After all, AI research has been going on for decades without making an impact outside a few specialised areas, such as oil exploration and computer chess. Why should that change now? </p> <p>\"Computer power,\" replies professor Hans Moravec, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. \"I think the primary bottleneck was computer power. It's a bit like having a rubber band engine to power a 747: it doesn't matter how good your aerodynamics is!\" </p> <p>Moravec argues that generally AI has not had access to more computer power since the 1960s, when research was done using $10m supercomputers and mainframes. Research moved to minicomputers, workstations and then microcomputers, each of which was dramatically cheaper but not inherently more powerful. In the 1990s, however, micro- computers increased in power from less than one MIPS (the ability to perform a million instructions per second) to 100 MIPS, and they're now approaching 1,000 MIPS. </p> <p>In fact, computer power is increasing so rapidly that Moravec is turning down speaking engagements and other distractions to concentrate on developing navigation systems for things like guard robots and cleaning machines. </p> <p>\"I'm rushing to capitalise on our decades of preparation before further increases in computer power make the problem so easy everyone will be doing it!\" Moravec says. </p> <p>\"The business plan says that with 1000 MIPS we can build that kind of thing. We'll have 1000 MIPS microcontrollers in about three years, and we'll go commercial at that point.\" </p> <p>Moravec typically compares the computer power available for AI and robotics with animal life forms. The 1 MIPS machine - think of a 1985 personal computer - is about as smart as a nematode worm. The new 1000 MIPS systems have advanced to insect level, perhaps approaching a spider. Moravec thinks he'll be able to apply the power of a guppy - \"not as smart as a goldfish\" - to building something like a robot vacuum cleaner in about 2005. </p> <p>The comparisons highlight the rate of progress. Computers are making the kinds of advances in five or 10 years that took evolution 25 or 50 million years. </p> <p> After another one or two thousand-fold increases, it's possible to imagine machines as smart as monkeys, or men. Moravec thinks we'll reach that stage in about 2040. </p> <p>\"I strongly believe that the development [of human-level robots] can be done incrementally,\" says Moravec. \"That was how intelligence was built the first time, by evolution. So what I look for is a series of slightly more sophisticated machines, each capable of earning a living.\" </p> <p>Steve Grand - who, at 41, was given an OBE for Creatures in the New Year honours list - has also decided to go into robotics, and this week announced a new company called CyberLife Research. </p> <p>\"I want to make machines that think,\" says Grand. \"I don't mind doing it in software, but I want to do it in hardware as well. I'm trying to develop a general-purpose brain on a chip. I'm not looking for applications right now, but I'm thinking of building a model glider that can learn to fly - hopefully before it hits the ground.\" </p> <p>Grand is sceptical about the field he's just entered - \"it took evolution millions of years for good reasons\" - but he agrees that 40 years is a reasonable time-scale for brain building. \"We should be at least at chimpanzee level.\" </p> <p>Hugo de Garis thinks he's leading the way, having formally switched on the CBM or CAM-Brain Machine (CAM stands for Cellular Automata Machine) on November 29 last year. This has been developed at the Evolutionary Systems Department of ATR Labs in Kyoto, Japan, and imple mented by Dr Michael Korkin's Genobyte Inc in Boulder, Colorado. </p> <p>The idea, in essence, is to build machines that create brain-like structures called neural networks by generating them automatically. De Garis says the CBM \"can evolve a neural net circuit module of some 1,000 neurons in a second or so\". The aim was to have an artificial brain with a billion neurons by 2001, though 75 million neurons now looks the likely maximum. </p> <p>Building the brain is only the first stage. \"Evolutionary engineers\" then need to turn the raw material into a working brain, before programmers can use it to control something like the Robo Kitten. All the kitten's behaviour patterns need to be specified, for example. De Garis says this should be running to provide \"proof of concept\" in two years. </p> <p>De Garis sees the scope for perhaps half a dozen brain-building projects in different countries, though the next two CBM installations will both be in Belgium. One will be at the Starlab in Brussels, where de Garis will become chief scientist at the end of this month. The other has been bought by Lernout &amp; Hauspie, which specialises in speech technology, and which includes Intel and Microsoft among its investors. But to create really useful artificial brains, de Garis thinks we need \"national brain-building projects - something equivalent to Nasa\". </p> <p>As well as being a brain builder, de Garis is also raising the alarm about the dangers of brain building: \"I'm very much part of the problem,\" he admits. </p> <p>\"In the short term, the products will have very beneficial effects: they'll be just wonderful,\" says de Garis. \"And the machines will get smarter and smarter year by year, until eventually they will become so smart they take over their own development. At that point, humans lose control. I think and think about how this terrible scenario can be avoided, but I just can't see a way out of it.\" </p> <p>Steve Grand is more optimistic. \"They're just another life form, and there are millions of other species out there who haven't 'taken over the world'. People are bound to be resistant at first, but then they're also scared of impersonal technology, and one of the good things A-life can do is make machines more personable and friendly. People will soon learn to love them!\" </p> <p> For more information visit: </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~degaris    \">Hugo de Garis</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.creaturelabs.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> Creatures</a></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm\">Hans Moravec </a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.cyberlife-research.com\">Steve Grand</a></p>",

Though they may like to think they are catching up with America, Britain's online retailers clearly still have a long way to go yet. </p> <p>That said, people can get as carried away with backlash stories as they can with hype. I did a lot of my present-buying online this December - having written the Guardian Guide to Shopping on the Internet, I felt honour-bound to have a go. </p> <p>By and large, it went pretty smoothly, with one or two notable exceptions, though I did limit my shopping to certain categories (books, CDs, toys, and chocolates) that the net does well. At Amazon (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">www.amazon.co.uk</a>), I picked up several books you wouldn't find on the average high street, and ordered some as late as December 20 and still got them in time. </p> <p>However, Amazon proved frustrating for children's books - you can't see the illustrations. I ended up going to the high street for a better look. Once there, I still couldn't find everything I wanted, so having done my research, I went back to Amazon and finally found satisfaction. Call it a clicks-and-mortar strategy. </p> <p>Buying CDs online was more problematic. If you're interested in mainstream chart fodder, you're fine shopping online. If you want something more off-beat, you need to search around and plan ahead. Mid-December I bought Goldie's Timeless and Junk Science by Deep Dish for my brothers, from Audiostreet (<a href=\"http://www.audiostreet.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.audiostreet.co.uk</a>). A few days later, the Goldie disc turned up. I went back to the site and discovered that they didn't have Deep Dish in stock but might get it in one or two weeks - not soon enough. In a rush, I'd made an elementary mistake and forgotten to check product availability. </p> <p>That said, it wasn't really my fault, since at the moment Audiostreet doesn't reveal stock details (they will soon, apparently), something which makes every purchase there a click in the dark. In the site's favour, when I rang to complain, the order was cancelled with no hassle. </p> <p>I had a trouble-free time buying two CDs back at Amazon and that persuaded me to risk buying two more CDs on 21 December, the site's last ordering day. Needless to say, these didn't arrive in time. When I contacted Amazon, it was implied that the CDs had probably been stolen on their way to me. Perhaps our postal service isn't as secure as we'd like to think. Once I complained, Amazon sent replacements free of charge. It was a good recovery, but I still had to go out and find an alternative present on Christmas Eve. </p> <p>In contrast, on December 20 I bought champagne truffles from Choc Express (<a href=\"http://www.chocexpress.com\">www.chocexpress.com</a>) and got them sent to my mother-in-law in Bristol. They arrived in good order in two days. </p> <p>Shopping for toys online didn't go so well. Everything that I looked for at eToys (<a href=\"http://www.etoys.com\">www.etoys.com</a>) seemed to be out of stock. A week and half before Christmas, I did find one thing I wanted - a Fisher Price Rescue Heroes helicopter for my son - at Toyzone (<a href=\"http://www.toyzone.co.uk\">www.toyzone.co.uk</a>). It was three pounds cheaper than in the shops, though delivery cost \u00a32.95, and arrived with no problems in three days - a good result. </p> <p>Things went less well at the American site, Toysmart (<a href=\"http://www.toysmart.net\">www.toysmart.net</a>). I wanted to buy a rather funky construction set called ZoLo, which you can't find over here, but the site wouldn't accept my credit card. </p> <p>After around 30 minutes in two different phone queues (to America! In the middle of the day!), I discovered it wasn't my fault. So I was urged to try again. I did. Again my purchase was rejected. After a big phone bill and a lot of wasted time, I won't be going back. </p> <p>Another purchase from America also proved frustrating. My daughter was desperate for a particular Barbie that's no longer available (the Rapunzel Barbie with extra long hair, if you must know). Via eBay (<a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ebay.co.uk</a>), I found it at Advantage Collectibles, a US specialist site (<a href=\"http://www.advantagecollectibles.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.advantagecollectibles.com</a>). But though I ordered it two weeks before the big day, it didn't arrive in time, which did cause some problems. However, without the net, I would never have managed to locate it, so I'm reluctant to complain too much. </p> <p>So what did I learn from all this? First, don't think you'll be doing all your Christmas shopping online. For the best results, use the real world and the net in tandem. Always check product availability before you try to buy. Finally, net shops do go out of stock and they often need to order in less popular CDs and books, all of which takes time. </p> <p>So start early, especially if you're buying something from abroad. If you do get started early, you won't be on your own. Chastened by surveys like that done by Book Track, which showed that delivery worries caused consumers to stop buying books online after December 11, retailers have decided that their e-Christmas 2000 push will need to get started in October. Only nine months to go, then. Bet you can't wait.</p>",

But the problem may not have been as great as predicted. Problems might still occur as we get further into the 21st century, but the likelihood lessens as days go by. </p> <p>However, the millennium bug was really the tip of a much greater iceberg. My work over the last 25 years has been to fit computers into many of the devices we use in our everyday life. I now teach others how to do this. These computers are not the kind that you purchase in the high street store. They are no bigger than the corner torn off a postage stamp and cost about the same as a postage stamp (before the software is written for them). </p> <p>They are buried (or embedded, to use the correct terminology,) in almost anything we use these days: washing machines, microwave cookers, televisions and videos, intruder alarms, central heating controllers, several in the average car, smart cards for automatic barriers in car parks and at railway stations. They can even flush the toilet. </p> <p>Industry uses these embedded computers in vast quantities to control and monitor all kinds of processes. The use of embedded computers makes equipment far less costly to manufacture and can provide many different facilities, including the ability to analyse themselves and inform the users when they are going wrong (as well as keeping working during the error). </p> <p>Despite the extremely high reliability of these systems, they do still go wrong now and then - how many of us have been stuck in a supermarket queue because the computerised till has just hiccuped and refused to acknowledge any more scanned items? </p> <p>The embedded computers need to be programmed just like all computers. Any programmer will tell you that all programs will contain errors (or bugs) and under certain conditions will not perform exactly as required. Most bugs are just simple errors and the majority are usually ironed out in the first few months that the device appears on the market (it does not always pay to be the first to buy some devices). </p> <p>But why are these systems not fully tested? The simple answer is that it is impossible to test fully all possible combinations of the tens of thousands of instructions that make up today's computer programs. To demonstrate this point, I show my students a small part of a typical computer program (about 20 instructions) and I ask them how many different ways there are of executing them. </p> <p>Most answer about 50 to 100, some brave ones suggest 1000 ways. When I tell them that this small, almost insignificant fraction of a program has two hundred and fifty thousand million (250,000,000,000) different ways it can be executed, I can see the disbelief in their eyes. I then go on to tell them that if ten of these combinations could be tested in a second, it would take over 800 years to fully test this small segment. </p> <p>Imagine how long it would take to test a typical program found in most modern equipment which would contain between 10,000 and 100,000 instructions. Maybe thousands or even millions of years. This means that no piece of equipment on the market today which contains a computer, can be fully tested. </p> <p>Most programmers have adopted a formal approach to writing programs which reduces (but do not eliminate) the bugs. The millennium bug is just one possible bug, but because manufacturers knew about it, they were able to test for it very simply. It is not all doom and gloom as in reality, only a tiny fraction of the possible ways of using a computer program will ever be used. </p> <p>There are many more bugs that are likely to exist in our computer systems than the millennium bug, some more significant than others. Microsoft's software has dominated most of the PC market, but many systems use Unix. The Unix operating system keeps track of time by counting the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. As Unix uses a fixed size number, it cannot count higher than 2,147,483,647. If one more count is added to this maximum, the number becomes wrong. This will occur at sometime in the year 2038. It is highly unlikely that many systems running the original version of Unix will still be operating then, and as we know about it, something can be done between now and then. </p> <p>Even more sinister bugs can lurk in our computer systems. Most people who use computers will be aware of the computer viruses that some unscrupulous programmers have deliberately corrupted the programs in our computers, such that under certain conditions, or at certain dates, the program fails to work properly. </p> <p>Some people have made a lot of money from selling anti-virus software that can detect and sometimes destroy the virus - just as some people have made a lot of money correcting the millennium bug (real or not). It is simplicity itself for an unscrupulous programmer to deliberately insert a bug into an embedded computer that will cause it to fail at a certain time or date - not just the millennium. </p> <p>This is like built in redundancy where after say, two years of operation, the computer program stops working and so the equipment fails. In this case, you would have no choice but to either send the equipment for repair, or replace it. </p> <p>It is impossible to know why the computer has failed, so hiding the misdemeanour of the unscrupulous programmer. Repairers would obtain a new, unused computer and, hey presto, the equipment would spring back to life - at least for another two years of use. </p> <p>Having said all this, in the 25 years of working with embedded computers, I have never come across one where a fault has been deliberately put in - but that's not to say they are not there! </p> <p> (Dr Christopher Hudson is a lecturer in computing and electronics at Brunel university as well as a consultant to industry.

      "body": "<p> A digital camcorder built-into a wrist-watch, a tiny pendant style camcorder and the world's smallest music players were among the highlights at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. </p> <p>The stars of the exhibition, which had previously seen the debut of the DVD player and digital camera, were gadgets designed to be worn on the wrist. Casio unveiled the first wearable digital camera, the WQV-1, which features a small LCD screen that acts as a viewfinder when recording images and as a monitor during playback. </p> <p>It is capable of storing up to 100 images in its 1MB memory, and pictures can be uploaded to a PC via an infra-red data transfer link. </p> <p>The watch, which Casio hopes will go on sale in the UK in early summer for around \u00a3250, captures images in black and white, although the company hopes that a colour version of the watch/camera will be available within the next year. </p> <p>Casio pulled out another showstopper in a wrist-watch that features an integrated MP3 digital audio player. The WMP-1V can store up to 33 minutes of what it claims is CD-quality music, or 66 minutes of FM standard sounds in its 64MB memory. </p> <p>The watch boasts a small screen that displays track and artist information, and has a headphones socket and a USB interface for connecting to your computer, to collect MP3 files downloaded from the internet. The MP3 watch is also scheduled to reach the UK in the summer, with a price tag of around \u00a3200 to \u00a3250. But Casio wasn't the only manufacturer to display a music-playing watch. Panasonic paraded its own slightly larger version among a range of futuristic devices that use its upcoming SD (Secure Digital) memory card. Developed in conjunction with Toshiba and SanDisk, the postage stamp sized card can store 64MB of digital information. That might seem remarkable enough, but the group also pledged to have a 256MB SD available by the end of this year. </p> <p>Scheduled for a world wide launch at the end of the year, the wristwatch can store up to 80 minutes of music on a standard 64MB SD, and up to five and a half hours on the mooted 256MB SD. </p> <p>Panasonic intends to incorporate SD technology on a host of innovative products many of which will be released in 2000/2001. Among them are tiny \"wear round the neck\" pendant style digital cameras and camcorders, handheld e-mail devices, and a microwave oven that uses the SD card to store recipes and control the cooking process. </p> <p>Not to be outdone, Sony unveiled a series of products that included what could well be the world's smallest audio player. A dead ringer for a cigarette lighter, the NW-E3 Network Walkman can store 64MB of downloaded music on its embedded flash memory. Similar to other models in Sony' s internet music range, the NW-E3 is SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative) compliant. And as it has no moving parts, it can be used while its owner takes part in all kinds of vigorous outdoor sports. The player is set to launch in the USA in April for around $330, with a UK launch expected later in the year. </p> <p>Sony also used CES as a platform to highlight the versatility of its Memory Stick digital storage media. Before the show the Stick had been used only in internet music playing Walkman products and the company's range of Vaio PCs. The Stick will now be integrated into Sony's digital camcorders to enable easy storage and downloading of digital still images. </p> <p>Other new gadgets from the company included a digital camcorder with built-in printer, a DVD Walkman range complete with LCD screens, and several tiny personal MiniDisk players and recorders. </p> <p>French-owned consumer electronics manufacturer Thomson continued its tradition of displaying concept products.

      "bodyText": "A digital camcorder built-into a wrist-watch, a tiny pendant style camcorder and the world's smallest music players were among the highlights at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. The stars of the exhibition, which had previously seen the debut of the DVD player and digital camera, were gadgets designed to be worn on the wrist. Casio unveiled the first wearable digital camera, the WQV-1, which features a small LCD screen that acts as a viewfinder when recording images and as a monitor during playback. It is capable of storing up to 100 images in its 1MB memory, and pictures can be uploaded to a PC via an infra-red data transfer link. The watch, which Casio hopes will go on sale in the UK in early summer for around \u00a3250, captures images in black and white, although the company hopes that a colour version of the watch/camera will be available within the next year. Casio pulled out another showstopper in a wrist-watch that features an integrated MP3 digital audio player. The WMP-1V can store up to 33 minutes of what it claims is CD-quality music, or 66 minutes of FM standard sounds in its 64MB memory. The watch boasts a small screen that displays track and artist information, and has a headphones socket and a USB interface for connecting to your computer, to collect MP3 files downloaded from the internet. The MP3 watch is also scheduled to reach the UK in the summer, with a price tag of around \u00a3200 to \u00a3250. But Casio wasn't the only manufacturer to display a music-playing watch. Panasonic paraded its own slightly larger version among a range of futuristic devices that use its upcoming SD (Secure Digital) memory card. Developed in conjunction with Toshiba and SanDisk, the postage stamp sized card can store 64MB of digital information. That might seem remarkable enough, but the group also pledged to have a 256MB SD available by the end of this year. Scheduled for a world wide launch at the end of the year, the wristwatch can store up to 80 minutes of music on a standard 64MB SD, and up to five and a half hours on the mooted 256MB SD. Panasonic intends to incorporate SD technology on a host of innovative products many of which will be released in 2000/2001. Among them are tiny \"wear round the neck\" pendant style digital cameras and camcorders, handheld e-mail devices, and a microwave oven that uses the SD card to store recipes and control the cooking process. Not to be outdone, Sony unveiled a series of products that included what could well be the world's smallest audio player. A dead ringer for a cigarette lighter, the NW-E3 Network Walkman can store 64MB of downloaded music on its embedded flash memory. Similar to other models in Sony' s internet music range, the NW-E3 is SDMI (Secure Digital Music Initiative) compliant. And as it has no moving parts, it can be used while its owner takes part in all kinds of vigorous outdoor sports. The player is set to launch in the USA in April for around $330, with a UK launch expected later in the year. Sony also used CES as a platform to highlight the versatility of its Memory Stick digital storage media. Before the show the Stick had been used only in internet music playing Walkman products and the company's range of Vaio PCs. The Stick will now be integrated into Sony's digital camcorders to enable easy storage and downloading of digital still images. Other new gadgets from the company included a digital camcorder with built-in printer, a DVD Walkman range complete with LCD screens, and several tiny personal MiniDisk players and recorders. French-owned consumer electronics manufacturer Thomson continued its tradition of displaying concept products. Among the items, which may or may not make it into the company's range next year, are a projector that features an integrated DVD player, a portable games machine that uses a mini DVD, and an MP3 player built into a rucksack. For consumer electronics manufacturers, the show's must have item was a DVD recorder. Almost every maker displayed a product, with Pioneer, Philips and Panasonic committing to UK launches in the next 12 months. Other highlights of the show included Samsung's phone watch, which the company believes could reach the UK in 2000, CD-jewel box sized portable speakers from the British manufacturer Wharfedale (pictured left), and a bathroom-friendly flat screen portable TV from Sharp.",

      "body": "<p>Apple's new fruits<br> Apple chief executive Steve Job's decision to drop the word \"interim\" from his title might have grabbed the headlines last week, but another announcement he made to MacWorld in San Francisco was much more interesting. </p> <p>Apple also unveiled its new iTools at <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">www.apple.com</a> , a web-based suite of services that are designed especially for Mac users. It is hoped that, because they're made only for Macs, users will notice improved speed and functionality - not to mention fewer of the irritating crashes that can bedevil Mac-using surfers of certain sites. </p> <p>Top of the list for MacSnobs like me is the @mac.com email addresses - although you'll have to move smartly to snap up the remaining prime addresses. There is also a HomePage service, allowing fast set-up of a personalised web page on Apple's newly beefed-up servers. </p> <p>Parents will appreciate the KidSafe service, which will allow users to block out web sites unsuitable for young eyes. Apple claims the filter is intelligent enough to block sex sites while still allowing kids to, say, do research for a biology project on animals' mating habits - unlike some rival services. And an Apple innovation wouldn't be complete without a nod towards aesthetics - which, in this case, is the new iCard greetings card service, a design-aware alternative - for Mac users only - to the generally pretty tacky e-card offerings elsewhere on the web. </p> <p>Why is Apple doing all this? Well there is, of course, a price to be paid to enter this world of exquisite taste and usefulness. You've got to have a Mac, and the latest Mac OS 9, which, presumably, is the payback. </p> <p><strong> Christmas clearout</strong><br> Got any unwanted Christmas prezzies? It used to be hideous ties, undrinkable spirits and dangerous-looking chocolates to be quietly disposed of in the new year. But going by what's up for grabs at the free ads paper, Loot, ( <a href=\"http://www.loot.com\">www.loot.com</a> ) times have changed. </p> <p>Loot has set up a special Unwanted Xmas Gifts section on its site to let its users raise some cash for the sales. Some of the things going cheap are so strange it's almost worth registering and logging in just for a browse. </p> <p>A quick foray this week found an unwanted Honda superbike, discarded BMW 3-Series lowering springs (still boxed - but what are they?) and several Sega Dreamcasts, including one going for only \u00a3100. </p> <p>Shouldn't Sega be worried? </p> <p><strong> A new type of web ring</strong><br> And, if by some freakish chance you manage to raise a four figure sum from offloading your unwanted lowering springs, why not splash out this Valentine's day at trendy upmarket jeweller's Van Peterson? The store is urging us to \"engage yourself in cyberspace\" by buying a ring through its website, at <a href=\"http://www.vanpeterson.com\">www.vanpeterson.com</a>. The site is fast and beautifully laid out, filled with stunning sparklers like the \u00a35,600 Pelham ring. There's only one question to ask with something like this: how many people are prepared to make a purchase this big without coming eye-to-facet with the item itself? </p> <p>Sorry...how unromantic. </p> <p><strong> Expanding horizons</strong><br> Or how about getting away from it all? Microsoft's Expedia website ( <a href=\"http://www.expedia.co.uk\">www.expedia.co.uk</a> ) has announced it is dropping the requirement to register to use its services. </p> <p>The move comes after figures from Jupiter research showed that 40% of users are put off sites which demand their details before giving them full access. Expedia includes content from the Rough Guides series of books, a travel magazine, fares information and the ability to book online. </p> <p><strong> Chance for a spree</strong><br> BT's comparison shopping website, <a href=\"http://www.btspree.com\">btspree.com</a>, is running a big giveaway until the end of the month. It is hoping to encourage more users to register for the service, which lets you compare products and prices from lots of retailers. </p> <p>The first 50,000 UK residents to sign up will get vouchers worth up to \u00a32000, claims the site, which can then be redeemed against holidays, theme park entries and cinema tickets.

      "bodyText": "Apple's new fruits Apple chief executive Steve Job's decision to drop the word \"interim\" from his title might have grabbed the headlines last week, but another announcement he made to MacWorld in San Francisco was much more interesting. Apple also unveiled its new iTools at www.apple.com , a web-based suite of services that are designed especially for Mac users. It is hoped that, because they're made only for Macs, users will notice improved speed and functionality - not to mention fewer of the irritating crashes that can bedevil Mac-using surfers of certain sites. Top of the list for MacSnobs like me is the @mac.com email addresses - although you'll have to move smartly to snap up the remaining prime addresses. There is also a HomePage service, allowing fast set-up of a personalised web page on Apple's newly beefed-up servers. Parents will appreciate the KidSafe service, which will allow users to block out web sites unsuitable for young eyes. Apple claims the filter is intelligent enough to block sex sites while still allowing kids to, say, do research for a biology project on animals' mating habits - unlike some rival services. And an Apple innovation wouldn't be complete without a nod towards aesthetics - which, in this case, is the new iCard greetings card service, a design-aware alternative - for Mac users only - to the generally pretty tacky e-card offerings elsewhere on the web. Why is Apple doing all this? Well there is, of course, a price to be paid to enter this world of exquisite taste and usefulness. You've got to have a Mac, and the latest Mac OS 9, which, presumably, is the payback. Christmas clearout Got any unwanted Christmas prezzies? It used to be hideous ties, undrinkable spirits and dangerous-looking chocolates to be quietly disposed of in the new year. But going by what's up for grabs at the free ads paper, Loot, ( www.loot.com ) times have changed. Loot has set up a special Unwanted Xmas Gifts section on its site to let its users raise some cash for the sales. Some of the things going cheap are so strange it's almost worth registering and logging in just for a browse. A quick foray this week found an unwanted Honda superbike, discarded BMW 3-Series lowering springs (still boxed - but what are they?) and several Sega Dreamcasts, including one going for only \u00a3100. Shouldn't Sega be worried? A new type of web ring And, if by some freakish chance you manage to raise a four figure sum from offloading your unwanted lowering springs, why not splash out this Valentine's day at trendy upmarket jeweller's Van Peterson? The store is urging us to \"engage yourself in cyberspace\" by buying a ring through its website, at www.vanpeterson.com. The site is fast and beautifully laid out, filled with stunning sparklers like the \u00a35,600 Pelham ring. There's only one question to ask with something like this: how many people are prepared to make a purchase this big without coming eye-to-facet with the item itself? Sorry...how unromantic. Expanding horizons Or how about getting away from it all? Microsoft's Expedia website ( www.expedia.co.uk ) has announced it is dropping the requirement to register to use its services. The move comes after figures from Jupiter research showed that 40% of users are put off sites which demand their details before giving them full access. Expedia includes content from the Rough Guides series of books, a travel magazine, fares information and the ability to book online. Chance for a spree BT's comparison shopping website, btspree.com, is running a big giveaway until the end of the month. It is hoping to encourage more users to register for the service, which lets you compare products and prices from lots of retailers. The first 50,000 UK residents to sign up will get vouchers worth up to \u00a32000, claims the site, which can then be redeemed against holidays, theme park entries and cinema tickets. The vouchers are valid until the end of next year. Lion kings and jungle prints \"Printer consumables\" and \"environmental awareness\" are two words not normally associated - but that was before the advent of Canon's new World Wildlife Fund website at www.canon-wwf.com.

OK, perhaps not quite that cool - we've all seen the scratchy, jerky efforts that stagger down the line using streaming media players like RealPlayer. But the Lava MusicVideo Player, from MP3 music people Creative Labs, displays information and graphics sequences to show as the song is being played - a first step towards fully-fledged, MTV-style videos for MP3.

To him, the voice of Peggy Lee was just as worthy of analysis and appreciation as that of Maria Callas, and his books powerfully advocate building on proven but diverse musical values.</p> <p>His extensive knowledge of voices and vocal art is distilled in his 10 books. Opera in Crisis: Tradition, Present, Future (1989) identifies him with those who deplore the modern producer's dominance in opera and the downhill direction in which he considered the art to be going. In his view, singers don't train long enough, sing roles too early, work excessively, and fly from production to production, never acquiring adequate acting experience - and nor indeed much intellectual grasp of the point of the exercise.</p> <p>Three other polemical works, The Agony of Modern Music (1955), Death of a Music? - The Decline of the European Tradition and the Rise of Jazz (1961) and Serious Music and All That Jazz (1969) attempt to demolish the existing gulf between \"serious\" music and jazz.</p> <p>Their argument that jazz is a more likely regenerative force for concert music than the starker excesses of modernism caused a great stir. Pleasants' view has come to be vindicated at least to the extent that in recent years concert music has been revitalised by drawing on a much wider range of tonal idioms and traditions, of which jazz is one.</p> <p>Pleasants was born in Philadelphia, the son of a doctor. Already a chorister in the Wayne Episcopal Church during his private education, he resisted plans for university.

      "bodyText": "Henry Pleasants, who has died aged 89, was the last great music critic of the past 60 years and, together with Constant Lambert, the first in print to \"cross over\" between different types of music. To him, the voice of Peggy Lee was just as worthy of analysis and appreciation as that of Maria Callas, and his books powerfully advocate building on proven but diverse musical values. His extensive knowledge of voices and vocal art is distilled in his 10 books. Opera in Crisis: Tradition, Present, Future (1989) identifies him with those who deplore the modern producer's dominance in opera and the downhill direction in which he considered the art to be going. In his view, singers don't train long enough, sing roles too early, work excessively, and fly from production to production, never acquiring adequate acting experience - and nor indeed much intellectual grasp of the point of the exercise. Three other polemical works, The Agony of Modern Music (1955), Death of a Music? - The Decline of the European Tradition and the Rise of Jazz (1961) and Serious Music and All That Jazz (1969) attempt to demolish the existing gulf between \"serious\" music and jazz. Their argument that jazz is a more likely regenerative force for concert music than the starker excesses of modernism caused a great stir. Pleasants' view has come to be vindicated at least to the extent that in recent years concert music has been revitalised by drawing on a much wider range of tonal idioms and traditions, of which jazz is one. Pleasants was born in Philadelphia, the son of a doctor. Already a chorister in the Wayne Episcopal Church during his private education, he resisted plans for university. Instead, he enrolled as a bass-baritone at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Because he was only 19 and his voice had not properly \"settled\", Pleasants contracted a form of laryngitis that lasted for the next five years. But though he could advance no further as a soloist, he gained many insights into performance. He became music critic of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin in the years of Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy with the Philadelphia Orchestra; the flourishing musical life of New York City was also within easy reach. In 1938, Pleasants travelled to Germany to improve his command of the language, spending several fruitful weeks in Dresden. He went on to stay in Budapest for three months with Tibor Serly, a violist from the Philadelphia Orchestra who had studied with Bartok. When the United States entered the war in 1940, Pleasants was called up, but not before he heard an impressive young pianist, Virginia Duffey, appearing in front of critics for the first time. Serly's untried violin and piano sonata did not go too well and, during the drinks which followed, Pleasants quietly suggested to Miss Duffey that she repeat her performance. Enthusiastic critical reaction ensued - and they were married in August, immediately before he was sent abroad in the army. In May 1945, Pleasants transferred to government service as an interpreter for the US commander in Vienna. He also became central European music correspondent of the New York Times and followed the revival of the Vienna Philharmonic and the reformed State Opera. Virginia - also a distinguished harpsichordist and fortepianist - joined him, and for the next five years the Pleasants combined foreign service business with participation in musical life. In Munich between 1950-52, they enjoyed the festivals of Bayreuth and Salzburg, and the ebullient Hans Knappertsbusch's presence as Munich's opera director; then they went to Berne in 1952, and finally to Bonn in 1956. Henry retired from government service in 1964, and the Pleasants settled in London, where he became the New York Herald Tribune's London music critic for the next 30 years. The time he had left for writing resulted in The Great Opera Singers: from the Dawn of Opera to Our Own Time (1966), now a standard work of reference. Pleasants knew most of those who figure in Great American Popular Singers (1974), and showed me personal letters of appreciation from Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and Ethel Merman. Pleasants always enjoyed discussing singing techniques across the board, and for 29 years until 1998 delivered his famous lectures on singers at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz.

His last book, The Great Tenor Tragedy (1985), told the story of Adolphe Nourrit, the French singer who worked with Rossini and Donizetti. A series of career setbacks and illnesses drove him to suicide at the age of 37; Pleasants' sympathy with him is very clear. Pleasants' first book and the work in progress at his death both drew on the writings of Eduard Hanslick, effectively the first professional music critic. Vienna's Golden Years (1955) translated a selection of pieces chronicling the city's musical life in the age of Brahms and Wagner; Pleasants had hoped to complete his work on his predecessor by translating Hanslick's autobiography. Henry Pleasants is survived by his wife, two sisters and a brother. Henry Pleasants, music critic and writer, born May 12 1910; died January 4 2000",

In 1933, she became a student at De Valois' Sadler's Wells School, and in 1935 joined the company, appearing first under the name June Bear. De Valois' brother, the photographer Gordon Anthony, recalled that his sister \"didn't care for the idea of performing bears in her company, so changed it to Brae.\" Two years earlier, she had re-christened Doris May as Pamela May, and the two names were happily linked throughout their professional careers and their lifelong friendship.</p> <p>\"June Brae and Pamela May,\" in addition to their many individual creations and successes, appeared together in tandem as leading swans in Swan Lake, as the two named Wilis in Act II of Giselle, and as the Red Girls in Ashton's Les Patineurs.

This work, about a French provincial wedding, had a text by Stein which dottily described the characters, and Ashton and his dancers brought them all vividly to life.

Helpmann's life cycle of man as symbolised in the creation of a ballet contained more stage effects than choreography, and did not long survive, but Brae's performance as The Ballerina was memorable.

      "body": "<p>The former doctor of East Germany's swimming team was yesterday found guilty of causing bodily harm to those in his care and given the heaviest sentence so far of a string of trials for drug misuse under the communist regime.</p> <p>But although Lothar Kipke, 72, was fined 7,500 marks (\u00a32,500) by the Berlin court, he will almost certainly not have to go to jail. While the judges agreed he should be given the 15-month sentence demanded by the prosecution, they decided it should be suspended.</p> <p>A former team member said afterwards that she was disappointed with the outcome, because the court had refused to admit medical evidence that performance-enhancing drugs taken by Martina Gottschalt, 34, and other swimmers had led to deformities in their children.</p> <p>\"How can one be happy with that?\" asked Ms Gottschalt, whose son, now aged 15, was born with a club foot. The former 100m and 200m champion was one of five women who were party to the case. They and others testified to being unaware at the time that they were taking the potentially dangerous steroids.</p> <p>Their lawyer, Michael Lehner, lashed Kipke in his concluding address, describing him as a \"non-doctor\" and accusing him of perverting the ethics of his chosen profession. \"How come a doctor was given charge of young girls to be used as guinea pigs?\", he asked. It was a question that had yet to be thrashed out in the German courts.</p> <p>Several cases have been brought to trial since March 1998, but so far most have been against low- and middle-ranking figures in the mighty sporting hierarchy of the former German Democratic Republic.</p> <p>The most senior official to be tried has been Horst R\u00f6der, the former vice-president of the sports and gymnastics federation, who was given a one-year suspended sentence last October. But the political responsibility for the systematic administration of drugs that damaged the health of thousands of sportsmen and women has yet to be settled in the courts.</p> <p>Kipke was found guilty on 54 counts of administering steroids. In sentencing him, the judge, Peter Faust, said Kipke had played a key role in the administration of drugs to talented young swimmers and that he had known of their harmful side-effects.</p> <p>The doctor had earlier admitted to the charges, but he claimed that in the 1970s, when he began giving out the drugs, only their minor side-effects were known.</p> <p>However, the policy of using steroids to give East Germans an unfair edge in competition persisted well into the 1980s, though the method of administering them changed. Injections were replaced with a tablet containing the steroid Turinabol, the court heard.</p> <p>The prosecution gave evidence to the court that young women in the national team were put on the birth control pill so that they did not become pregnant, apparently because of fears that the steroids could result in deformities.</p> <p>The court yesterday turned down a request from Mr Lehner to admit evidence about deformities in the children of two of the five women he represented.</p> <p>The judges ruled that the evidence of a link with the drugs taken by the two swimmers was inconclusive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former doctor of East Germany's swimming team was yesterday found guilty of causing bodily harm to those in his care and given the heaviest sentence so far of a string of trials for drug misuse under the communist regime. But although Lothar Kipke, 72, was fined 7,500 marks (\u00a32,500) by the Berlin court, he will almost certainly not have to go to jail. While the judges agreed he should be given the 15-month sentence demanded by the prosecution, they decided it should be suspended. A former team member said afterwards that she was disappointed with the outcome, because the court had refused to admit medical evidence that performance-enhancing drugs taken by Martina Gottschalt, 34, and other swimmers had led to deformities in their children. \"How can one be happy with that?\" asked Ms Gottschalt, whose son, now aged 15, was born with a club foot. The former 100m and 200m champion was one of five women who were party to the case. They and others testified to being unaware at the time that they were taking the potentially dangerous steroids. Their lawyer, Michael Lehner, lashed Kipke in his concluding address, describing him as a \"non-doctor\" and accusing him of perverting the ethics of his chosen profession. \"How come a doctor was given charge of young girls to be used as guinea pigs?\", he asked. It was a question that had yet to be thrashed out in the German courts. Several cases have been brought to trial since March 1998, but so far most have been against low- and middle-ranking figures in the mighty sporting hierarchy of the former German Democratic Republic. The most senior official to be tried has been Horst R\u00f6der, the former vice-president of the sports and gymnastics federation, who was given a one-year suspended sentence last October. But the political responsibility for the systematic administration of drugs that damaged the health of thousands of sportsmen and women has yet to be settled in the courts. Kipke was found guilty on 54 counts of administering steroids. In sentencing him, the judge, Peter Faust, said Kipke had played a key role in the administration of drugs to talented young swimmers and that he had known of their harmful side-effects. The doctor had earlier admitted to the charges, but he claimed that in the 1970s, when he began giving out the drugs, only their minor side-effects were known. However, the policy of using steroids to give East Germans an unfair edge in competition persisted well into the 1980s, though the method of administering them changed. Injections were replaced with a tablet containing the steroid Turinabol, the court heard. The prosecution gave evidence to the court that young women in the national team were put on the birth control pill so that they did not become pregnant, apparently because of fears that the steroids could result in deformities. The court yesterday turned down a request from Mr Lehner to admit evidence about deformities in the children of two of the five women he represented. The judges ruled that the evidence of a link with the drugs taken by the two swimmers was inconclusive.",

      "body": "<p>Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers will today today urge the European Union to tear down tariff barriers on goods from the world's 48 poorest countries so they can export their way out of poverty.</p> <p>In a meeting this evening with his EU counterpart, Pascal Lamy, Mr Byers will propose the measure as a way of rebuilding trust between the developing world and the west, damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Organisation's attempts to launch a new round of global trade talks in Seattle last month. \"As part of the post-Seattle agenda the EU must be prepared to offer increased market access to the goods from least developed countries,\" Mr Byers said, in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We need to have a bonfire of tariffs as far as these countries are concerned.\"</p> <p>Mr Byers believes the EU must offer a lead in two areas - reform of the WTO, whose decision-making process was severely criticised by delegates in Seattle, particularly from the developing countries - and tariff reform for the poorest countries.</p> <p>EU negotiators in Seattle were pushing for all western countries to provide tariff-free access for the least developed countries. However, with the WTO paralysed since the failure of the talks, Mr Byers believes the EU should now move unilaterally.</p> <p>Aid groups welcomed Mr Byers' pledge but warned that as well as cutting tariffs, Europe must tackle the damage wrought on agriculture in the third world by its subsidy bloated farming sector.</p> <p>EU reluctance to reform agricultural policy contributed to the collapse of the Seattle talks. \"If international trade rules are to benefit the poor this will be an important first step, but the real challenge for the EU will be to remove export subsidies that lead to the dumping of surpluses on poor countries,\" said Justin Forsyth, Oxfam's head of policy.</p> <p>Earlier this week Mr Byers met with Mike Moore, the head of the WTO, to discuss options for the overhaul of the Geneva-based body. Among the proposals which have been floated is the notion of an \"eminent persons group\" of politicians to examine how to make the WTO more democratic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers will today today urge the European Union to tear down tariff barriers on goods from the world's 48 poorest countries so they can export their way out of poverty. In a meeting this evening with his EU counterpart, Pascal Lamy, Mr Byers will propose the measure as a way of rebuilding trust between the developing world and the west, damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Organisation's attempts to launch a new round of global trade talks in Seattle last month. \"As part of the post-Seattle agenda the EU must be prepared to offer increased market access to the goods from least developed countries,\" Mr Byers said, in an interview with the Guardian. \"We need to have a bonfire of tariffs as far as these countries are concerned.\" Mr Byers believes the EU must offer a lead in two areas - reform of the WTO, whose decision-making process was severely criticised by delegates in Seattle, particularly from the developing countries - and tariff reform for the poorest countries. EU negotiators in Seattle were pushing for all western countries to provide tariff-free access for the least developed countries. However, with the WTO paralysed since the failure of the talks, Mr Byers believes the EU should now move unilaterally. Aid groups welcomed Mr Byers' pledge but warned that as well as cutting tariffs, Europe must tackle the damage wrought on agriculture in the third world by its subsidy bloated farming sector. EU reluctance to reform agricultural policy contributed to the collapse of the Seattle talks. \"If international trade rules are to benefit the poor this will be an important first step, but the real challenge for the EU will be to remove export subsidies that lead to the dumping of surpluses on poor countries,\" said Justin Forsyth, Oxfam's head of policy. Earlier this week Mr Byers met with Mike Moore, the head of the WTO, to discuss options for the overhaul of the Geneva-based body. Among the proposals which have been floated is the notion of an \"eminent persons group\" of politicians to examine how to make the WTO more democratic.",

      "body": "<p>To theatregoers, Stephen Dillane is one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing made him the Evening Standard's Best Actor of 1999. His Hamlet in 1994 for the Peter Hall Company was rated as one of the best of the decade, and Angels in America, where Dillane took one of the two lead roles, was universally acclaimed as one of the National's greatest ever shows. </p> <p>But outside the theatre Dillane is virtually unknown. None of his films have done magnificently well (Welcome to Sarajevo was probably his biggest leading role), and if you want to remind people who he is, you have to mention performances: the good-looking one in The Rector's Wife, Horatio to Mel Gibson's Hamlet, Clov to Alun Armstrong's Hamm in Endgame. Then they either say \"Nope, sorry, still can't place him\", or agree that he is, after all, brilliant. It's odd, because he is so very good-looking, and such a good actor, that he really should have broken through to the big time. In Warsaw, where we meet for a meal during the filming of a TV series, he is just another anonymous Brit.</p> <p>Dillane, 40, grew up in south London, the son of a surgeon, and got involved in theatre at school. He remembers being in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and thinking of the moment where Rosencrantz points out towards the audience and shouts \"Fire!\" as \"a very thrilling thing to be able to do\". Then he toddled off to Exeter university and read history and politics, before starting work as a journalist at the Croydon Advertiser. He hated journalism \"from the moment I walked in\".</p> <p>Why? \"I just didn't fit in. It seemed very_\" He hesitates for a long time, looking for the right word. This happens frequently throughout the interview. \"Pinched,\" he eventually concludes. \"There was someone else who joined at the same time - a very expansive sort of person - and he really got put down and shown his place. I didn't like that. I kept a low profile, but I felt inhibited - it all seemed very dangerous. It demanded a resilience that maybe I didn't have.\" After a couple of bruising encounters at NUJ meetings, and a few years going round cemeteries checking how many cremations they'd had that week, he read an interview with Trevor Eve about how he'd given up architecture to become an actor, and that was it. He packed in the shorthand (\"I was never very fast; I doubt I can still do it\") and headed off to Bristol Old Vic theatre school.</p> <p>The theatre seems the last place of refuge for a sensitive soul like Dillane: rejections, bitchiness and politics are surely the bread and butter of the theatrical community. But Dillane claims never to have come across it. Sometimes he'll socialise with the cast, sometimes he won't. He's never been too closely associated with one company or director (although he works with Katie Mitchell whenever possible), and he tries to see it all as a job. Or so he says. But despite a jokey \"Maybe I don't take work seriously enough\", it's clear from his descriptions of his insecurity as an actor that at times he takes it all too seriously.</p> <p><strong> <sup>'</sup>I </strong> f you feel uncomfortable on stage,\" Dillane declares, \"you can very easily descend into a sort of abyss, convinced you're the worst actor ever, that you're a disgrace to the profession, that you're a disgrace to yourself. It's an awful feeling. I've got better at relaxing, and just telling myself that I'm probably not the worst actor and that it's fine. But once it gets hold of you, and you feel like you're letting everybody down, it's terribly difficult to let go of.\" Does he still get it? \"Oh yes. Oh god, yes.\"</p> <p>Perhaps that's one reason he's not better known. I ask if he actually wants to be famous, and he spends a long pause trying to get at the egg yolk at the bottom of his soup. \"I don't think so,\" he says finally, quietly. \"It feels like a poisoned chalice to me.\" He dives back into his soup quickly and then surfaces to say: \"I probably don't, because I keep taking decisions that turn me away from that. In some way these things are out of your control, but it's like when you get a script through, and it's associated with all sorts of people and you know it could be good for you and you find yourself either not going along, or going along and not working quite hard enough to get it. Some bit of you is holding you back. Maybe I'm not grown up enough: I don't want to spend 10 weeks of my life being miserable on a film set doing something I don't want to do.\"</p> <p>Tom Stoppard said of Dillane's performance in The Real Thing that it had \"such integrity as to scare the life out of an author\", and this is probably true of every part Dillane takes on. He certainly thinks deeply about every question put to him. When, during one particularly long pause, I ask why he doesn't do what other actors do and just say whatever comes to mind, he explains that he wants to understand why he does what he does. \"I'm curious myself.\"</p> <p>The longest pauses, of course, are reserved for questions about his personal life. He admits to having two children, aged eight and one, but will go no further. Other sources reveal that he's had a long, live-in relationship with actress Naomi Wirthner.</p> <p>As Karenin, the repressed husband in Channel 4's production of Anna Karenina (the reason he is in Poland), he will, I think, be brilliant. Of course, he won't even admit the possibility. He is useless at plugging himself. Asked about the film The Darkest Light, which is coming out this week, he starts trying to remember when he made it, and then is unable to recall the name of the film he did afterwards.</p> <p>The way he talks about his looks is typical: he worries that work might get a little harder to find as he gets older. But he never made much use of them anyway, turning down numerous good-looking-guy roles after making the hearts of middle England flutter in 1994's The Rector's Wife. \"I couldn't work my way into being a good-looking guy,\" he says. \"There you are, being a good-looking guy, and what next?\" I suggest flirting and he says he's never really been much good at that. \"I think it basically takes a while for me to warm up.\" Not shy, he insists, just guarded. \"I always have been.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "To theatregoers, Stephen Dillane is one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing made him the Evening Standard's Best Actor of 1999. His Hamlet in 1994 for the Peter Hall Company was rated as one of the best of the decade, and Angels in America, where Dillane took one of the two lead roles, was universally acclaimed as one of the National's greatest ever shows. But outside the theatre Dillane is virtually unknown. None of his films have done magnificently well (Welcome to Sarajevo was probably his biggest leading role), and if you want to remind people who he is, you have to mention performances: the good-looking one in The Rector's Wife, Horatio to Mel Gibson's Hamlet, Clov to Alun Armstrong's Hamm in Endgame. Then they either say \"Nope, sorry, still can't place him\", or agree that he is, after all, brilliant. It's odd, because he is so very good-looking, and such a good actor, that he really should have broken through to the big time. In Warsaw, where we meet for a meal during the filming of a TV series, he is just another anonymous Brit. Dillane, 40, grew up in south London, the son of a surgeon, and got involved in theatre at school. He remembers being in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and thinking of the moment where Rosencrantz points out towards the audience and shouts \"Fire!\" as \"a very thrilling thing to be able to do\". Then he toddled off to Exeter university and read history and politics, before starting work as a journalist at the Croydon Advertiser. He hated journalism \"from the moment I walked in\". Why? \"I just didn't fit in. It seemed very_\" He hesitates for a long time, looking for the right word. This happens frequently throughout the interview. \"Pinched,\" he eventually concludes. \"There was someone else who joined at the same time - a very expansive sort of person - and he really got put down and shown his place. I didn't like that. I kept a low profile, but I felt inhibited - it all seemed very dangerous. It demanded a resilience that maybe I didn't have.\" After a couple of bruising encounters at NUJ meetings, and a few years going round cemeteries checking how many cremations they'd had that week, he read an interview with Trevor Eve about how he'd given up architecture to become an actor, and that was it. He packed in the shorthand (\"I was never very fast; I doubt I can still do it\") and headed off to Bristol Old Vic theatre school. The theatre seems the last place of refuge for a sensitive soul like Dillane: rejections, bitchiness and politics are surely the bread and butter of the theatrical community. But Dillane claims never to have come across it. Sometimes he'll socialise with the cast, sometimes he won't. He's never been too closely associated with one company or director (although he works with Katie Mitchell whenever possible), and he tries to see it all as a job. Or so he says. But despite a jokey \"Maybe I don't take work seriously enough\", it's clear from his descriptions of his insecurity as an actor that at times he takes it all too seriously. 'I f you feel uncomfortable on stage,\" Dillane declares, \"you can very easily descend into a sort of abyss, convinced you're the worst actor ever, that you're a disgrace to the profession, that you're a disgrace to yourself. It's an awful feeling. I've got better at relaxing, and just telling myself that I'm probably not the worst actor and that it's fine. But once it gets hold of you, and you feel like you're letting everybody down, it's terribly difficult to let go of.\" Does he still get it? \"Oh yes. Oh god, yes.\" Perhaps that's one reason he's not better known. I ask if he actually wants to be famous, and he spends a long pause trying to get at the egg yolk at the bottom of his soup. \"I don't think so,\" he says finally, quietly. \"It feels like a poisoned chalice to me.\" He dives back into his soup quickly and then surfaces to say: \"I probably don't, because I keep taking decisions that turn me away from that. In some way these things are out of your control, but it's like when you get a script through, and it's associated with all sorts of people and you know it could be good for you and you find yourself either not going along, or going along and not working quite hard enough to get it. Some bit of you is holding you back. Maybe I'm not grown up enough: I don't want to spend 10 weeks of my life being miserable on a film set doing something I don't want to do.\" Tom Stoppard said of Dillane's performance in The Real Thing that it had \"such integrity as to scare the life out of an author\", and this is probably true of every part Dillane takes on. He certainly thinks deeply about every question put to him. When, during one particularly long pause, I ask why he doesn't do what other actors do and just say whatever comes to mind, he explains that he wants to understand why he does what he does. \"I'm curious myself.\" The longest pauses, of course, are reserved for questions about his personal life. He admits to having two children, aged eight and one, but will go no further. Other sources reveal that he's had a long, live-in relationship with actress Naomi Wirthner. As Karenin, the repressed husband in Channel 4's production of Anna Karenina (the reason he is in Poland), he will, I think, be brilliant. Of course, he won't even admit the possibility. He is useless at plugging himself. Asked about the film The Darkest Light, which is coming out this week, he starts trying to remember when he made it, and then is unable to recall the name of the film he did afterwards. The way he talks about his looks is typical: he worries that work might get a little harder to find as he gets older. But he never made much use of them anyway, turning down numerous good-looking-guy roles after making the hearts of middle England flutter in 1994's The Rector's Wife. \"I couldn't work my way into being a good-looking guy,\" he says. \"There you are, being a good-looking guy, and what next?\" I suggest flirting and he says he's never really been much good at that. \"I think it basically takes a while for me to warm up.\" Not shy, he insists, just guarded. \"I always have been.\"",

Rosa Rodriguez - the judge who ruled to keep Elian in Florida on the grounds that he would face \"irreparable harm\" in Cuba - was revealed to have had substantial political and business links with Armando Gutierrez, the chief spokesman for the exile campaign to block the boy's return. According to public records, she paid Mr Gutierrez $10,000 (and his wife, Maritza, more than $53,000) for helping Ms Rodriguez's 1998 campaign for election as a circuit judge. Ms Rodriguez defended her self yesterday, saying: \"A judge has no ethical obligation to disclose participation by attorneys or participants in a past judicial election campaign.\" An opinion poll yesterday found that 56% of Americans supported the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) in its efforts to return Elian to his father, with only 36% opposing.",

This code will include spelling out relations between special advisers and their conduct with the media and civil servants. But Lord Neill dismissed suggestions that special advisers had necessarily broken Whitehall rules. The number of special advisers appointed by the government is now 74 - up from 38 at the beginning of 1997. They are employed at a cost of \u00a33.9m to the taxpayer. `The considerable increase in numbers, particularly at No 10 where influential roles are played by special advisers raises the question of whether their authority outweighs that of objective advisers,'' the report said. The report says a new code of conduct should make clear that special advisers had a specific duty to uphold the impartiality of the civil service as well as regulating their contacts with the media. Lord Neill said that while the committee had not concluded that there had been a ` politicisation '' of the civil service , they believed that the time had now come to `take stock'' of the situation. He said that he would `deplore'' any spin doctor who briefed journalists on behalf of their minister against rival members of the government. Lobbyists He rejects the need for the registration of lobbyists but accepts evidence from Observer journalist Greg Palast that records of meetings between lobbyists and ministers, civil servants and special advisers should be kept. But he provides a loophole for special advisers - by saying they should only record meetings where the lobbyist tries to influence people rather than seek information. Lord Neill said that even the recorded information will remain secret for 30 years under the present freedom of information act because it will relates `to the formulation or development of policy''.

But Lord Neill introduces caveats, including putting the onus on ministers seeking sponsorship to ensure that this is in the public interest. He says departments must publish details of all deals exceeding \u00a35,000. Lord Neill's committee has much stronger views about the politicisation of the NHS. It warns that the present system - which has seen a huge increase in political appointments under Labour - has caused `considerable disquiet' and welcomes the present inquiry being undertaken by Dame Rennie Fitch, the public appointments commisisoner, into its operation. Patronage Lord Neill also calls for restrictions on Labour's creation of 44 task forces from industry and research bodies to investigate problems from social exclusion to problems on housing estates. He expresses concern that they could be a new form of political patronage under Labour and says they should only have a limited life to investigate particular problems.

Sartorius, finding there is more money to be made from decency than dirt, cynically plans to repair his properties. Harry agrees to join him in a risky investment.

With numbing literalism, Peter McKintosh's set actually consists of a stony terrace and a broken-windowed conservatory in which Sartorius ostensibly lives. Even more dauntingly, Fiona Shaw drags the play's erotic subtext kicking and screaming into the open. Harry kisses and crotch-grabs his travelling companion Cokane. Notwithstanding, Harry and Blanche don't just embrace on the Rhine but go at it hammer and tongs, observed by her father. And Lickcheese, Sartorius's sacked rent collector who uses his insider knowledge for personal profit, turns up in the last act sporting a black dress and matching beads. </p> <p>None of this would matter very much - good plays outlive silly directors - if it weren't that it symbolises the production's whole shift of emphasis from the system to the individual. Shaw's ultimate black joke is that even the idealistic Harry and the impassioned Blanche end up complicit with capitalism: the happy ending is biliously ironic. So what do we get here? Blanche is transformed into a neurotically pregnant Hedda Gabler left gazing wanly at her estranged lover. Thus the most openly socialist play of the Victorian era is turned into a psychological case history; where Bernard Shaw's play attacks individualism, Fiona Shaw's production celebrates it.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The competition commission is set to deliver a savage blow to the hopes of consumers - and ministers - for a steep fall in British car prices this year. </p> <p>The commission's long-awaited and much delayed report - due to be handed over to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, later this month - is expected to conclude that powers to enforce lower prices could seriously damage the car industry. </p> <p>Ministers, who ordered an inquiry into the gap between UK and European mainland car prices, have already repeatedly fallen out with the inquiry team headed by Denise Kingsmill QC, the commission's deputy chairman. </p> <p>But well-placed sources said yesterday that the report is likely to prove a huge disappointment for those expecting radical steps to slash thousands of pounds off the price of new, used and leased cars. </p> <p>Faced with a sharp decline in new year sales, as customers eagerly await the commission's report, dealers are warning that the March number-plate switch to \"W\" could prove a turkey unless ministers swiftly publish - and act on - the findings before then. </p> <p>However senior industry sources said the inquiry team has concluded that any further cut in car-makers' margins could seriously damage the industry and ultimately hurt consumers by depressing used-car values. </p> <p>The commission, insiders disclosed, has discovered that in the five years from 1994-98 the domestic car industry's margins averaged just 2%. Some manufacturers, including notably Rover, remained in negative territory throughout most of the period. </p> <p>The commission had considered outlawing list prices for new cars but appears to have had second thoughts after being told this would have little or no impact - and advised by the inland revenue that it would dent its yield from company car tax. </p> <p>Similarly, the inquiry team is said to have considered an early exit from the EU's \"block exemption\" from normal competition rules, scheduled to be reviewed in 2002, and allowing manufacturers to franchise dealers. </p> <p>But amid evidence that the team is still gathering information from manufacturers and dealers, even this has proved problematic and has been abandoned as an option. </p> <p>The report is likely, however, to recommend the \"unbundling\" of dealers' financial offers from car sales. </p> <p>Uncertainty about the commission's findings, according to Alan Pulham of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, has effectively \"killed\" January's sales and could similarly hit March, a boom month for car buying. </p> <p>It has led consumers to buy cars in mainland Europe or surf the internet for the best deals. Yesterday Reg Vardy, the car dealer group, said it would launch a new website covering its 80 UK showrooms in March to cope with a hoped-for sales rush that month. </p> <p>Peter Vardy, the group's chairman and chief executive, announcing a 17.9% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half to \u00a314.97m, said the industry needed clarity and a new structure on pricing. \"The only cloud over the industry is the price issue,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 Water and sewerage firms yesterday launched a rearguard action against plans to end their local monopolies, claiming that unlicensed operators could soon be supplying unfit water via their pipes. The competition act comes into force on March 1, forcing water firms to allow entrants access to their distribution systems. Ian Byatt, the director general of regulator Ofwat, has said he will impose fines if they impose unfair barriers to rivals. </p> <p>But Water UK, the umbrella body for the firms, said there was a legal \"black hole\" that would allow new suppliers to operate without a licence and outside the monitoring regime of the drinking water inspectorate. It said that Mr Byatt should be given specific powers to license newcomers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The competition commission is set to deliver a savage blow to the hopes of consumers - and ministers - for a steep fall in British car prices this year. The commission's long-awaited and much delayed report - due to be handed over to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, later this month - is expected to conclude that powers to enforce lower prices could seriously damage the car industry. Ministers, who ordered an inquiry into the gap between UK and European mainland car prices, have already repeatedly fallen out with the inquiry team headed by Denise Kingsmill QC, the commission's deputy chairman. But well-placed sources said yesterday that the report is likely to prove a huge disappointment for those expecting radical steps to slash thousands of pounds off the price of new, used and leased cars. Faced with a sharp decline in new year sales, as customers eagerly await the commission's report, dealers are warning that the March number-plate switch to \"W\" could prove a turkey unless ministers swiftly publish - and act on - the findings before then. However senior industry sources said the inquiry team has concluded that any further cut in car-makers' margins could seriously damage the industry and ultimately hurt consumers by depressing used-car values. The commission, insiders disclosed, has discovered that in the five years from 1994-98 the domestic car industry's margins averaged just 2%. Some manufacturers, including notably Rover, remained in negative territory throughout most of the period. The commission had considered outlawing list prices for new cars but appears to have had second thoughts after being told this would have little or no impact - and advised by the inland revenue that it would dent its yield from company car tax. Similarly, the inquiry team is said to have considered an early exit from the EU's \"block exemption\" from normal competition rules, scheduled to be reviewed in 2002, and allowing manufacturers to franchise dealers. But amid evidence that the team is still gathering information from manufacturers and dealers, even this has proved problematic and has been abandoned as an option. The report is likely, however, to recommend the \"unbundling\" of dealers' financial offers from car sales. Uncertainty about the commission's findings, according to Alan Pulham of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, has effectively \"killed\" January's sales and could similarly hit March, a boom month for car buying. It has led consumers to buy cars in mainland Europe or surf the internet for the best deals. Yesterday Reg Vardy, the car dealer group, said it would launch a new website covering its 80 UK showrooms in March to cope with a hoped-for sales rush that month. Peter Vardy, the group's chairman and chief executive, announcing a 17.9% rise in pre-tax profits for the first half to \u00a314.97m, said the industry needed clarity and a new structure on pricing. \"The only cloud over the industry is the price issue,\" he said. \u0095 Water and sewerage firms yesterday launched a rearguard action against plans to end their local monopolies, claiming that unlicensed operators could soon be supplying unfit water via their pipes. The competition act comes into force on March 1, forcing water firms to allow entrants access to their distribution systems. Ian Byatt, the director general of regulator Ofwat, has said he will impose fines if they impose unfair barriers to rivals. But Water UK, the umbrella body for the firms, said there was a legal \"black hole\" that would allow new suppliers to operate without a licence and outside the monitoring regime of the drinking water inspectorate. It said that Mr Byatt should be given specific powers to license newcomers.",
